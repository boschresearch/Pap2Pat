    "title": "Rapid Detection of Hepatitis B Virus in Blood Plasma by a Specific and Sensitive Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay",
    "date": "2014-04-04",
    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important blood-borne pathogen that causes hepatic inflammation and can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conventional methods of HBV detection are time consuming and require highly trained personnel and elaborate equipment. This report describes the development of a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) for detection of HBV genotypes A, B, C, D, E, and F in blood samples.HBV standard plasma panels and clinical donor plasma specimens were used for the development and validation of the LAMP assay. Amplification was performed at 60\u00b0C for 60 minutes using extracted DNA or heat-treated plasma specimens without DNA extraction. The assay was evaluated for its ability to detect various HBV genotypes and for its sensitivity, specificity, and time-point of detection.The LAMP assay detected HBV genotypes A-F and demonstrated a sensitivity of 10-100 IU per reaction of HBV DNA. The assay also detected 69 of 75 (92%) HBV-positive donor plasma specimens tested and demonstrated a specificity of 100%.These results demonstrate that our HBV-LAMP assay is rapid, sensitive and specific, and capable of detecting the major HBV genotypes. This assay could be used in clinical point-of-care settings, mainly in endemic and resource-limited environments for HBV diagnostics, donor screening, epidemiological studies, and therapeutic monitoring of patients undergoing antiviral treatment.",

                "The prevalence of HBV infection in underprivileged communities and regions of the world has generated heightened concerns in healthcare circles worldwide [20][21][22][23][24][25]. HBV screening and diagnosis in resource-limited environments is often a challenging situation, because of time and cost limitations, thus leaving infected individuals undiagnosed for several years. This underscores the need for a simple and rapid diagnostic and screening tool that is applicable not only in resource-limited settings, but also in any region of the world with high prevalence of HBV infections [26][27][28]. In developed settings, the HBV-LAMP assay could be useful to verify that a patient undergoing HBV treatment has achieved full virological suppression.",
                "In the present study, we developed and validated a sensitive and rapid isothermal amplification assay for pan-detection of HBV genotypes (A-F) in plasma specimens (Figure 2). The HBV-LAMP assay offers several advantages over conventional \"gold standard\" methods such as real-time PCR or ELISA: (i) the assay does not require sophisticated equipment and costly reagents, (ii) it requires less time (<60 minutes) to conduct, and (iii) it is performed on a simple digital heat block, without the need for high technical expertise. Thus, in regions with struggling national economies and lack of high-tech diagnostic equipment, these advantages make the HBV-LAMP assay well suited for use in such resource-limited settings for blood screening and diagnosis of HBV infection.",
                "The sensitivity of the HBV-LAMP assay was evaluated to assess its clinical and field applicability, using characterized standards and blinded clinical plasma specimens. Compared with the FDA-licensed Procleix Ultrio Plus dHBV test, the HBV-LAMP assay detected 69 of 75 (92%) HBV-positive donor plasma specimens (Table 1); the assay sensitivity approaches 100% with the use of fluorophores for detection (data not shown). As shown by the Probit data in Table 2, the LAMP assay also revealed a 100% detection rate for 25, 50, 10 2 , 10 3 , and 10 4 IU of HBV DNA per reaction, whereas 1 IU and 10 IU of HBV-DNA was detected at 25% and 57% rates, respectively. These findings suggest that the LAMP assay performed efficiently when used in testing and analysis of clinical specimens for HBV infection.",
                "Sample enrichment and volume play a critical role in detection sensitivity. For example, the Procleix Ultrio assay utilizes an automated target capture specimen-processing method and employs higher volumes [29] (see packet insert]. On the other hand, the HBV-LAMP assay used a smaller starting volume for nucleic acid extraction and a smaller input volume for amplification, yet yielding a sensitivity of 92% (Table 1). Thus, given its plausible performance vis-\u00e0-vis the clinical and epidemiological relevance of HBV infection, the HBV-LAMP assay is potentially applicable in field environment and in clinical settings for screening and rapid detection of HBV infection.",
                "Notably, the LAMP assay also successfully detected HBV DNA in heat-treated plasma (Supplementary Figure 1B), irrespective of the possible presence of potential amplification inhibitory substances that are found in blood products [30,31]. This method of template preparation (as opposed to nucleic acid extraction) contributed to the rapidity of the assay and simplified the detection process (Supplementary Figure 1 and3D). However, an increase in the volume of starting material from 25 \u00b5L to a larger volume (eg, 100 \u00b5L) may be necessary to improve the sensitivity of detection when using heat-treated plasma for the reaction. Further investigation of this method may prove helpful in resource-limited environments to facilitate the test at lower cost and ease. In consideration of detection specificity and accuracy in clinical diagnostics, primers in this LAMP assay were designed that specifically targeted conserved sequences of the S gene and overlapping polymerase regions that show about 96% sequence identity and homology across the HBV genotypes [32]. As shown in Figure 2, the LAMP assay detected various HBV genotypes (A-F), thereby demonstrating its global coverage of HBV detection. When healthy donor plasma samples (n = 107) were tested, the HBV-LAMP assay revealed a diagnostic specificity of 100% as no amplification of HBV DNA was observed in these specimens (Table 1). This characteristic of the HBV-LAMP assay was also confirmed by its detection of only the target HBV DNA without cross-reaction with CMV, PV, T. cruzi, or the Leishmania species (Figures 3C and3D).",
                "Within the context of today's globalization, people have been moving across international borders either for sociopolitical/socioeconomic reasons or for recreational purposes [33][34][35]. This rapid trend of human migration has influenced the spread of viral hepatitis and its changing epidemiology from Afghanistan to Pakistan, from the Indian subcontinent and Asia to the eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, and the United States [34,[36][37][38]. Hence, the severity and prevalence of HBV emphasizes the need for a rapid and affordable diagnostic screening tool as reported in this study, which could be used to investigate HBV prevalence in different regions of the world. A noteworthy advantage of the LAMP assay reported in this study is its use of a thermostable reaction buffer (MAB) and the Bst DNA polymerase, 2 major components that allowed preparation of reaction mixture at room temperature as well as performance of amplification under isothermal conditions without compromising sensitivity. It is well established that Bst DNA polymerase has DNA strand displacement activity, whereas L-proline has a destabilizing effect on the DNA double helix, lowers the melting temperature of DNA, confers salinity tolerance, and aids in DNA polymerase stability [12][13][14]. In addition, D-mannitol, a hygroscopic and osmopotent material, also promoted buffer stability and robustness under thermostressed conditions [39,40]. As demonstrated by the accelerated stability tests, the MAB surprisingly retained a considerable level of stability and robustness (Supplementary Figure 3A-C).",
                "The advent of nucleic acid amplification tests in clinical diagnosis and donor blood screening brought tremendous improvement by ensuring safety of blood products and prevention of disease transmission. Yet, diagnostic tools such as PCR-based tests have inherent limitations that include the lack of rapidity, laborious performance process, use of cumbersome equipment, and being easily prone to contamination [41,42]. In contrast, the HBV-LAMP assay demonstrates ease of performance, rapidity, sensitivity, and the use of multiple primers that makes the assay highly specific and less liable to cross-contamination. The assay detected 50 IU of HBV DNA in 30 minutes, thereby reducing the reaction time for detection (Supplementary Figure 2). These advantages of the HBV-LAMP assay could contribute to filling gaps seen in transfusion medicine in resource-limited settings. Although we did not further investigate the assay's timecourse of detection using a lower amount or concentration of DNA, it is plausible to suggest that the entire 60-minute reaction time may be required to detect a smaller quantity of DNA (approximately 10 IU/reaction) as shown in Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 3B. Also, field studies would be necessary to confirm the reliability of the assay in developing world-settings.",
                "Considered in aggregate, the HBV-LAMP detection assay reported in this study is rapid, simple to use, and specific. Mostly applicable in environments with scarcity of medical diagnostics resources, the HBV-LAMP assay could be used for blood screening and detection of HBV infection in highly endemic populations and for therapeutic monitoring of patients undergoing antiviral treatment."
