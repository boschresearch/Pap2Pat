                        "Malaria is one of most dangerous infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical countries, afflicting about 300 million people. The pathogen of the disease is a protozoan parasite, Plasmodium sp. which is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Four major species of malaria parasites can infect humans under natural conditions: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. P. falciparum and P. vivax cause the most infections worldwide. P. falciparum is the agent of severe, potentially fatal malaria. Malaria caused by P. falciparum is responsible for nearly 500 thousand deaths annually. Based on recent estimates from the WHO, worldwide, there were an estimated 216 million malaria cases among 3.3 billion people at risk living in 91 countries (WHO World Malaria Report 2017). Infections caused by P. falciparum and P. vivax account for more than 90% of global malaria burden; the former being responsible for nearly all the deaths due to malaria, most in children under 5 years. Malaria also poses a serious threat (including death) to tens of millions of nonimmune travellers per year who travel to malarious areas. Leder et al., 39 C. I. D. 1104-12 (2004). Malaria in travellers is commonly associated with noncompliant or no oral chemoprophylaxis. Cullen et al., 65 MMWR S. S. 1-22 (2016). Given the current lack of a clinically useful vaccine, long-acting parenteral chemoprophylaxis would provide convenient and durable antimalarial protection, effective within hours of dosing, that eliminates noncompliance and the necessity for carrying (and taking) medication."

                        "The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that atovaquone can be administered intramuscularly and provide chemoprophylaxis against malaria. GlaxoSmithKline's Mepron\u00ae (atovaquone) is used to treat various opportunistic and parasitic infections. In the murine Plasmodium berghei sporozoite challenge model, the present inventors found that orally dosed Mepron fails by one week after dosing, but the same amount dosed intramuscularly protects for five weeks. Thus, the present invention provides compositions and methods related to the intramuscular injection of atovaquone.",

Accordingly, there are a variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. In particular embodiments, atovaquone is formulated for intramuscular injection. In other embodiments, formulations for parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal and interperitoneal administration are contemplated, and are in no way limiting. More than one route can be used to administer the compound(s), and in certain instances, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective response than another route.",
                        "The parenteral formulations will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the compounds in suspension. Preservatives and buffers may be used. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants, for example, having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations will typically range from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include, for example, polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol.",
                        "The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets.",
                        "Injectable formulations are in accordance with the invention. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for injectable compositions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Trissel, 15th ed., pages 622-630 (2009)).",
                        "For purposes of the invention, the amount or dose of atovaquone administered should be sufficient to effect a prophylactic or therapeutic response in the subject over a reasonable time frame. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular compound and the condition of a human, as well as the body weight of a human to be treated. The dose of atovaquone of the present invention also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound. Typically, an attending physician will decide the dosage of the compound with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, compound to be administered, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being treated. In particular embodiments, the atovaquone comprises a dosage in an amount effective to prevent malaria for between two to five weeks as described herein. Subject can receive follow up intramuscular injections of atovaquone to further prevent malaria for additional time periods as necessary.

Fed mosquitoes were maintained for 18 d (19\u00b0 C., 80% relative humidity), when salivary glands were harvested into RPMI medium and disrupted by several passages through a 0.5 in 28-gauge needle to release sporozoites. Parasites were counted by hemocytometer and diluted to 25,000 mL\u22121 RPMI. C57BL6 mice were challenged by intravenous infusion of 5,000 sporozoites in 200 \u03bcL RPMI.",

                                "All dosing materials were constituted just before use. Mepron suspension (150 mg/mL atovaquone) was the starting material. Pluronic F-68 (10%) was used to dilute Mepron to required dosing concentration (\u2264100 mg/mL), or as vehicle control. For the washed drug preparation, atovaquone was pelleted from diluted Mepron (50 mg/mL, 13,000\u00d7g, 10 min) and the supernatant was replaced with equal volume 0.9% NaCl. Washing was repeated three times prior to final resuspension of excipient-depleted atovaquone at 50 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl for dosing. C57BL6 male mice (\u02dc20 g; 3-5 per group) were injected intramuscularly (biceps femoris; 23-gauge needle, 100 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe) with diluted or washed Mepron (40 \u03bcl total volume, 20 \u03bcl per limb). Oral Mepron was administered by gavage. At predetermined post-dose intervals, animals were challenged with P. berghei ANKA by infusion of 5,000 sporozoites into a tail vein. Starting 4 d post-challenge then weekly thereafter for 42 d, tail snip blood samples were examined for parasites via Giemsa-stained thin smears. Each experiment included an untreated cohort to validate the challenge. Efficacy outcomes were binary. The appearance of parasitemia in any animal in a cohort was designated a dosing failure. Animals remaining parasite-free at 42 days post-challenge were considered protected, and treatment was deemed protective if all animals in a dosing cohort were protected. To obtain atovaquone pharmacokinetics, blood was harvested (microtainer tubes, BD Biosciences), centrifuged (1300\u00d7g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.), and plasma was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. Atovaquone concentration in plasma was assayed by UPLC-MS/MS as described (Chambliss et al., 1 J. AL. M. 400-09 (2017).",

C57/BL6 mice were injected with a dose of 36 mg/kg (see in vivo efficacy section above for details). 7 days post-dose, three groups of 4 mice each (3 dosed and 1 untreated per group) were challenged with intravenous infusions of 5000, 50000, or 500000 sporozoites. 48-51 h post-challenge, two dosed mice from each treated and challenged group were exsanguinated and their blood was subinoculated into na\u00efve mice to allow liver-emergent parasites to proliferate in a drug-free background. All mice were monitored periodically for emergence of blood-stage parasites."
