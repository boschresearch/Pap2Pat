    "abstract": "Chemoprophylaxis is currently the best available prevention from malaria, but its efficacy is compromised by non-adherence to medication. Here we develop a long-acting injectable formulation of atovaquone solid drug nanoparticles that confers long-lived prophylaxis against Plasmodium berghei ANKA malaria in C57BL/6 mice. Protection is obtained at plasma concentrations above 200 ng ml-1 and is causal, attributable to drug activity against liver stage parasites. Parasites that appear after subtherapeutic doses remain atovaquone-sensitive. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis indicates protection can translate to humans at clinically achievable and safe drug concentrations, potentially offering protection for at least 1 month after a single administration. These findings support the use of long-acting injectable formulations as a new approach for malaria prophylaxis in travellers and for malaria control in the field.",

                "Every year, Plasmodium falciparum malaria afflicts hundreds of millions of people and kills hundreds of thousands of children1. Despite considerable success in reducing the worldwide prevalence of malaria, its incidence in visitors to endemic areas has continued to rise steadily2, 3, and for unprotected travellers to west Africa the risk of malaria is 3.4% mo\u22121 4. Though promising advances are being made, as of yet no malaria vaccine can reliably impart high levels of long-lived protection. Antimalarial drugs thus continue to provide an essential component of malaria prophylaxis. Unfortunately, however, the requirement for daily or weekly oral drug-dosing regimens is commonly associated with noncompliance2, 3.",
                "Human infection with falciparum malaria begins with sporozoite inoculation by a female anopheline mosquito. This parasite form migrates rapidly to the liver, invades hepatocytes and amplifies ~20,000-fold, then spills into the bloodstream to initiate the self-propagating 48\u2009h erythrocytic cycle responsible for all disease manifestations (Fig.\u00a01). Most antimalarial drugs target erythrocytic parasites, but several are effective against liver stages. To preclude resistance, ill patients (who may harbour up to 1012 infected red cells) are treated with drug combinations. However, in the numerically advantageous situation of malaria prophylaxis, where drug concentrations are well established before the introduction of a small number of parasites, monoprophylaxis (e.g., with mefloquine or doxycycline) is a common and highly effective option4.Fig. 1Utility of long-acting antimalarial prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic exposure to atovaquone monotherapy via oral administration blocks liver and erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle within the host (causal and suppressive activity, respectively). However, there is a vulnerability of oral dosing to non-adherence. The current work reports the preclinical development of an intramuscular long-acting nanomedicine, which provides sustained protection to parasite exposure in a preclinical model, expected to provide at least 1-month protection in humans",
                "Atovaquone (Fig.\u00a02a), a structural mimic of ubiquinone, selectively binds to the cytochrome b of malaria parasites, inhibits respiration and collapses the trans-mitochondrial membrane potential5, 6. A broad-spectrum antiprotozoal, for 25 years orally dosed atovaquone has been used for the prophylaxis and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. In this setting, its approved dosing to obtain sustained and high target plasma concentrations (above 20\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121, 54\u2009\u00b5M)7 is safe and well tolerated5. Atovaquone is not metabolised, exhibits few drug\u2013drug interactions, and has a plasma half-life measurable in days. It has potent sub-nanomolar activity against erythrocytic P. falciparum in vitro, is not cross-resistant with other antimalarials, and has activity against both liver stage (causal) and erythrocytic (suppressive) parasites. A causal mechanism of prophylaxis has several distinct advantages, including the fact that it targets a smaller number of parasites (before they complete a four log amplification in liver) and clinically that it requires just 1, not 4, weeks of postexposure dosing. To preclude resistance in patients with established erythrocytic infection, atovaquone was marketed in fixed combination with proguanil. However, recent studies have indicated that atovaquone-resistant P. falciparum cannot survive in, or be transmitted by, mosquitoes8. This remarkable phenomenon would not affect the risk of resistance in atovaquone monotherapy of established erythrocytic parasitemia, but it does avoid the problem of monoprophylaxis failure stemming from mosquito-borne transmission of atovaquone-resistant parasites.Fig. 2Creation and screening of atovaquone nanoformulations. a Hydrophobic hydroxynaphthoquinone atovaquone was formulated to generate candidate ATQSDN nanoparticles. b ATQSDN library was screened for Z-average nanoparticle diameter after dispersion into water (0.5\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121, 25\u2009\u00b0C); 'hits' (solid bars) were selected for further evaluation. c Eleven ATQSDN 'hits' were evaluated using an in vitro rapid equilibrium dialysis intramuscular depot model assay (SIF) using ATQSDN formulation prepared with 3H-labelled atovaquone",
                "Most approaches for making nanoparticle formulations involve creating either drug-associated nanocarriers (drug conjugation, complex-formation or encapsulation)9, 10 or excipient-stabilised nanoparticles of drug (solid drug nanoparticles; SDNs)11\u201313, using attrition methods such as nanomilling or high-pressure homogenisation. A major limitation of both approaches is the low ratio of drug to non-therapeutic excipients that can be attained (commonly \u226425% dry weight). Emulsion-templated freeze drying (ETFD)14, 15 is an alternative method for creating SDNs that entails the use of inactive commercial excipients commonly used in FDA-approved medicines, and allows very high-drug loadings relative to excipients (often \u226570% by weight). Orally administered high-drug content SDN formulations, initially identified through ETFD screening and latterly scaled using emulsion spray drying under good manufacturing practices conditions, are now in clinical trials for antiretroviral indications16, 17. The approach has also been employed to determine how physical characteristics impact biological performance by screening nanoformulation libraries18, 19. Nano-milled antiretroviral drugs have recently received considerable attention after clinical trials of LAI (long-acting injectable)\u00a0medicines demonstrated therapeutic plasma drug exposure for between 1 and 3 months, offering treatment simplification and addressing medication adherence20\u201322. Importantly, these formulations have also shown remarkable preclinical utility for pre-exposure prophylaxis for which they are now in clinical trials, validating the LAI approach for prophylaxis. The marked hydrophobicity of atovaquone (log P\u2009=\u20094.7) and its low systemic clearance make it particularly suitable for LAI. Moreover, the high-drug content of ETFD-generated formulations minimises the required injection volume and its associated intolerability.",
                "Here, using the stringent P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 mouse model for malaria, we have found that intramuscular atovaquone nanoformulation provides reliable chemoprophylaxis, for up to 4 weeks after dosing, against an intravenous sporozoite challenge. Pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic analyses indicate that protection is obtained at plasma atovaquone levels well below those currently in clinical use for other indications, and that protection is attributable to causal action against liver stage parasites."

                        "A library of SDNs, containing atovaquone and a binary combination of polymer and surfactant excipient stabilisers, was created using the recently reported rapid ETFD-screening approach16. Seven candidate polymers and six surfactants were chosen from the FDA CDER list of inactive ingredients23 and the resulting 42 formulations, all 80\u2009wt% atovaquone, 13\u2009wt% polymer and 7\u2009wt% surfactant, were assessed by dynamic light scattering (Fig.\u00a02b). Candidate formulations were chosen for progression if the following criteria were met: (1) complete aqueous dispersion at 0.5\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121; (2) SDN Z-average diameter <1000\u2009nm to match existing LAI paradigms; (3) dynamic light-scattering analysis <5% SD (three scans) within the measured Z-average diameter indicating stability during analysis; and (4) a measured polydispersity index <0.4 to maximise uniformity of drug release from injected SDNs. All 42 candidates were ranked against these criteria and eleven (Supplementary Table\u00a01) were identified that also passed the reproducibility screening in subsequent repeated syntheses (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). SDN zeta potentials for the eleven candidates ranged from +8 to \u221220\u2009mV (Supplementary Table\u00a01), indicating that stability of the dispersed samples in water was predominantly correlated to steric stabilisation derived from the water-soluble excipients. 3H-atovaquone utilised in a miniaturised ETFD SDN production and characterisation revealed very strong correlation of outcomes at this reduced scale (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01)."

                        "The 11 SDN candidates were studied by in vitro rapid equilibration dialysis. Each SDN was dispersed into simulated interstitial fluid (SIF) and compared with unformulated atovaquone (<1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in SIF). Scintillation counting allowed rapid determination of drug release, and five candidates (ATQSDN2, 4, 6, 7, 8) providing a 50-fold range of drug-release rates (Fig.\u00a02c) were progressed to in vivo testing. High-drug content minimises depot volume but may also negatively impact the desired release rate. Therefore, SDN formulations were generated for ATQSDN4, ATQSDN6 and ATQSDN8 (that exhibited highest, lowest and intermediate release rate in initial screens, respectively) using the same procedures and excipient mixtures, to establish the effect on release rate of systematic lowering of the drug loading from 80\u2009wt% through to 20\u2009wt% (Supplementary Table\u00a02, and Supplementary Figs.\u00a02\u20135). For all three formulations, a decrease in release rate was observed as drug content increased to 60\u2009wt%. Although this trend was continued to 80\u2009wt% for ATQSDN6 and ATQSDN8 ATQ. A higher release rate for ATQSDN4 was observed at 80\u2009wt% drug loading. These data highlight a critical need to determine release kinetics at different drug loadings for LAI."

Infection in this system is lethal, and parasitemia reliably results from inoculation of just 50 sporozoites. However, there are notable differences between falciparum and berghei, including the shorter development times for P. berghei in liver (48\u2009h vs 6.5 d) and erythrocytes (24 vs 48\u2009h). In our hands over 14 months\u2019 time, in experiments involving some 320 mice, an intravenous challenge of 5000 sporozoites was lethal in every untreated animal, and the liver stage was confirmed to require \u226545 and \u226448.

Prophylaxis was deemed successful only if no animal in a dosing cohort became parasitemic by 42 days after challenge, in two independent experiments. Experiments included untreated controls to validate the challenge, and mice treated with the same dose of atovaquone given orally.Fig. 3Efficacy testing of ATQSDN7. a Experimental scheme. Mice dosed on day 0 with placebo, oral atovaquone or intramuscular nanoparticle atovaquone formulation were challenged once with intravenous P. berghei sporozoites at a given interval after dosing (28 days is depicted).

Mice injected with 36, 100 or 200\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 ATQSDN7 were challenged at intervals up to 6 weeks after dosing (Fig.\u00a03b).

The erythrocytic challenge was devised to provide a bloodstream parasitemia comparable to that seen 48\u2009h after a 5000 sporozoite inoculation. ATQSDN7 protected against all sporozoite challenges but failed against all challenges by erythrocytic forms. Although a suppressive contribution may be operative after sporozoite challenge, ATQSDN7 clearly provided substantial causal activity.Fig. 4Causal vs suppressive prophylactic antimalarial activity.

A safe and effective long-acting intramuscular drug-dosing preparation would provide a new tool, which joins the high efficacy of chemotherapy with the durability and ease of adherence more characteristic of a vaccine. These are, to our knowledge, the first studies of a long-acting slow-release nanoformulation of drug for causal malaria prophylaxis. They provide a convincing rationale for further exploring this strategy, and pharmacokinetic criteria for proof-of-concept clinical trial.",
                "In the lethal P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 mouse model of malaria, ATQSDN7 or ATQSDN8 provided complete protection against a large sporozoite challenge for up to 4 weeks after a single intramuscular dose (Fig.\u00a03b). The duration of prophylaxis was dose-dependent, and comparison of plasma atovaquone levels at the time of challenge demarcates 200\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 as a reasonable threshold for efficacy (Fig.\u00a05b). This benchmark is in close agreement with data from P. falciparum sporozoite challenge studies in non-immune healthy volunteers, in which \u2265200\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 atovaquone at the time of challenge was at least 96% protective in 24 subjects27, 28. (The single failure was thought due to an assay error that led investigators to 'question whether this volunteer truly had malaria'28.) Since the half-life after oral dosing of atovaquone in humans is allometrically eight times slower than that in mice (70 vs 9\u2009h)25, 27, the duration of prophylaxis afforded by a 200\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 slow-release depot in humans will almost certainly extend beyond the 28 days obtained in mice, at a concentration-time exposure well within the chronic >20\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121 required in patients for Pneumocystis pneumonia or toxoplasmosis.",
                "Unusual among antimalarials, atovaquone has activity against primary liver stages as well as erythrocytic parasites (causal and suppressive, respectively). When a pretreated animal is challenged with sporozoites, atovaquone thus has two opportunities against the parasite: during the initial liver stage and again during the subsequent asexual erythrocytic cycle. We were intrigued to find that in the P. berghei ANKA-C57BL/6 model, efficacy against sporozoite challenge is attributable largely, if not entirely, to action against hepatic forms (Fig.\u00a04). Atovaquone levels efficacious against sporozoite challenge did not protect mice challenged with erythrocytic parasites. Though comparable relevant data in humans are limited, plasma levels substantially higher than 200\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 are required for activity against established erythrocytic infection29, 30. Furthermore, in sporozoite challenge studies, human subjects prophylaxed with atovaquone have no evidence of ever having developed an erythrocytic infection, by exquisitely sensitive PCR methods or blood culture27, 28, 31. Many factors could account for this apparent differential effect of atovaquone, including, for example, an intrinsically greater susceptibility of hepatic forms, drug accumulation in liver, or both.",
                "Given the propensity for erythrocytic parasites to develop cytochrome b mutations that impart drug resistance6, 30, we evaluated the atovaquone sensitivity of parasites that survived a 36\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 low prophylactic dose, when challenge was 2 weeks after injection (Fig.\u00a06). These parasites (like their untreated controls) remained drug sensitive when subinoculated into naive mice. This finding, in conjunction with a <120\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 subtherapeutic plasma atovaquone concentration at the time of challenge, indicates therapeutic failure rather than drug resistance. At all dose levels we studied, parasitemia after intramuscular atovaquone nanoformulation was associated with plasma concentrations below 200\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 by the time of sporozoite challenge, consistent with a simple therapeutic breakpoint (Fig.\u00a05b).",
                "Although a substantial body of preclinical and clinical evidence is already available for orally dosed atovaquone, progression of this work toward clinical trial will require careful preclinical toxicity testing, especially with respect to the injection site. Our studies suggest that atovaquone alone may be suitable for malaria prophylaxis in non-immune travellers, but the obtained plasma levels and propensity for engendering resistance would proscribe its use in patients with established erythrocytic infection. Limited clinical information indicates that atovaquone may also have causal activity against vivax malaria32, but like orally dosed atovaquone/proguanil, mefloquine or doxycycline, it would not be expected to preclude the establishment of latent hypnozoites.",

This is a potential option for non-immune people travelling to malarious areas, whose trips typically last 4 weeks or less33, and if carefully deployed it may also provide an intervention in malaria control efforts."
