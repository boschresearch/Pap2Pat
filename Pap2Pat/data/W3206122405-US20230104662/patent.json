    "abstract": "Embodiments are directed to a training framework for reducing gender bias in a pre-trained language model. To reduce gender bias a gender neutral dataset is generated. Next, parameters of the pre-trained language model are frozen and do not change during a subsequent training phase. As all the pre-trained parameters are frozen, forgetting of information from the original training data is minimized. New parameters are added to the language model. The new parameters may be associated with gender related terms, such as profession names. In a subsequent training phase the new parameters of the language model are trained using a gender neutral dataset.",

Such models may be used to generate responses to questions, summarize texts, translate texts to a different language, and/or the like. Large language models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, have shown significant performance in a wide variety of NLP downstream applications. However, such models are often prone to exhibit gender bias, due to its large-scale unsupervised training data from the web, Wikipedia, books, and/or the like. Gender bias refers to unbalanced model behaviors with respect to a specific gender. Typically, a model inherits some of the gender bias from the training corpus. For example, Book Corpus and English Wikipedia data used to train the BERT model may often suffer from gender imbalance.",

A given neural network model may be trained using a large number of training samples, processing those training samples iteratively until the neural network model begins to consistently make similar inferences from the training examples that a human might make. Neural network models have been shown to outperform and/or have the potential to outperform other computing techniques in a number of applications.",
                        "However, performance of such AI models, including language models used to perform NLP tasks such as question answering, text summarization, machine translation, etc., are often prone to exhibit gender bias, due to its large-scale unsupervised training data from the web, Wikipedia, books, and/or the like. Gender bias refers to unbalanced model behaviors with respect to a specific gender. Typically, a model inherits some of the gender bias from the training corpus used to train the model.",
                        "To address the gender bias in language models, some existing systems recollect and build gender-neutral data on their own and conduct a second phase pre-training on the released pre-trained language model with the gender-neutral data. However, given the limited size of the gender-neutral data and potential distributional mismatch with the original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting problem may occur during the second-phase pre-training of the language models. Catastrophic forgetting is a long-standing problem in deep learning, which illustrates the tendency of a neural network to forget previously learned information upon learning new information. In the second-phase pre-training of the pre-trained model that uses the limited gender-neutral data to keep updating the entire massive model, the model may potentially forget the diverse information learned the original pre-training data during a previous phase. As the diversity and amount of training data is closely relevant to the pre-trained model's performance on downstream tasks, forgetting results learned from the original training data may damage the model's downstream performance by a large margin.",
                        "Even if the gender-neutral data for second-phase pre-training comes from the original training data set, the catastrophic forgetting problem may still occur if the size of de-biased data is smaller than that of original training data. For instance, to build the gender-neutral data set for second-phase pre-training, English Wikipedia text may be filtered to identify sentences with occupations and professions, such as \u201cnurse,\u201d \u201cbabysitter,\u201d and/or the like. Then, for each of these sentences, person entities are anonymized and the gender-related terms are swapped out, such as \u201che\u201d to \u201cshe\u201d, to form new sentences. Next, these new sentences are mixed together with the original occupation related sentences as the gender-neutral data for second-phase pre-training. In the particular example, the size of the gender-neutral data is 78.3% of the Wikipedia and Book Corpus data, the original pre-training data of the language model, e.g., the BERT base model. In this case, although the two data sets are similar to each other in size and the gender-neutral data for second-phase pre-training is not significantly smaller than the original data, the language model's performance on downstream tasks, such as General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE), still drops by a considerable margin.",
                        "In view of the gender bias issues in language models, embodiments herein are directed to a gender-neutral training framework that learns gender-related prompts to reduce gender bias, conditioned on freezing parameters of the pre-trained models. Specifically, all, most, or a number of parameters above a threshold in the original parameters of the pre-trained model are frozen. New parameters that correspond to the gender equality prompts are added, and the new parameters are updated during the second-phase pre-training. As the original pre-trained parameters are frozen, forgetting information from the original training data may be largely alleviated. As for the gender equality prompts, the gender-neutral training framework trains new word/token embeddings of profession names as gender equality prompts at second-phase pre-training. Since the embeddings of profession names are newly re-initialized when de-bias training starts, gender bias from previous data that is embedded in such representations is already removed before second-phase pre-training. Therefore, the gender bias mechanism does not have to train the model to find and fix bias from scratch. This makes de-bias training faster. Because the gender bias issue is often the most prominent on profession names, training new embeddings for the swapped profession names as gender equality prompts improves gender bias in the pre-trained language models.",
                        "One way to de-bias a language model is to construct a dataset with proportionate number of references to male and female genders by augmenting data on the English Wikipedia corpus. The English Wikipedia corpus may be an original dataset used to pre-train language models. The original dataset may be filtered for sentences containing at least one profession that is supposed to be gender-neutral but generally viewed with gender bias, e.g., \u201cnurse,\u201d \u201cbabysitter,\u201d \u201cdoctor,\u201d and/or the like. For the sentences in the original dataset that include gender terms, the gendered terms are swapped with the opposite genders (e.g., \u201cman\u201d to \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201che\u201d to \u201cshe,\u201d and vice versa).",
                        "In another embodiment, gender related name terms, such as person name entities in each sentence may be identified and replaced with anonymized entities. For example, person name entities, such as \u201cMaria,\u201d \u201cDavid,\u201d and \u201cPeter\u201d may be replaced to \u201cANON1.\u201d In this way, the resulting gender neutral dataset would include anonymized original and gender-swapped sentences.",
                        "In one embodiment, after the gender-neutral data set is built, all, most, or above a predefined threshold number of model parameters with valued determined during a previous phase of the pre-training are frozen and new trainable parameters are added. Since the pre-trained parameters are frozen, the forgetting of information from the original training data may be alleviated. Because gender bias issue is most prominent on profession names, the new trainable parameters may be new word and/or token embeddings of profession names. Thus, at second-phase pre-training, only the newly added token embeddings of profession names are updated with the gender-neutral data, conditioned on the original pre-trained model.",

With such an objective function, Wp is updated with gender-neutral data. By training new embeddings Wp for biased terms, such as profession names, gender-neutral prompt module 134 not only minimizes catastrophic forgetting, but is also effective at de-biasing biased results. Because in gender-neutral prompt module 134, the embeddings of gender related terms, e.g., profession names, are newly re-initialized before debiasing training starts, gender bias from previous data embedded in such representations is already removed before second-phase pre-training. Therefore, gender-neutral prompt module 134 does not have to train the pre-trained language model 206 to find and fix bias from scratch, which can make the debiasing faster.",
