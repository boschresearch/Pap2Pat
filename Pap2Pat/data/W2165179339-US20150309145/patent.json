    "abstract": "The invention disclosed herein provides methods for implementing Sampling Interval Modulation Magnetic Resonance Elastography (\u201cSLIM-MRE\u201d), based on simultaneous encoding and acquisition of individual displacement components using motion encoding gradients with different time discretization intervals to MRI analysis. The components are modulated with different frequencies in the MR signal phase, which can be expressed as a harmonic function of the start time, or equivalently of initial phase, of the motion encoding gradient components. As a result, all displacement components can be acquired faster than in conventional MRE, and can be derived from the same temporally-resolved MR phase images. This also allows for simultaneously acquired 3D displacement data and storage of such data in the same k-space.",

                        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to image the internal tissues of a subject. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a technique for determining mechanical properties of a subject under study by introducing mechanical vibrations in the subject undergoing MRI.",
                        "MRI is typically performed by placing the subject or object to be imaged at or near the isocenter of a strong, uniform magnetic field, B0, known as the main magnetic field. The main magnetic field causes the atomic nuclei (spins) that possess a magnetic moment in the matter comprising the subject or object to become aligned in the magnetic field. The spins form a magnetization that precesses around the magnetic field direction at a rate proportional to the magnetic field strength. For hydrogen nuclei (which are the common nuclei employed in MRI), the precession frequency is approximately 64 MHz in a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla. If the magnetization is perturbed by a small radio-frequency magnetic field, known as a B1 magnetic field, the spins emit radiation at a characteristic radio frequency (RF). The emitted RF radiation can be detected and analyzed to yield information that may be used to produce an image of the subject or object. For purposes of the discussion herein, the term \u201cobject\u201d will be used to refer to either a subject (e.g., a person) or an object (e.g., a test object) when describing magnetic resonance imaging of that \u201cobject.\u201d",
                        "In practice, magnetic field gradients are also applied to the subject or object in addition to the main magnetic field. The field gradients are typically applied along one or more orthogonal axes, (x, y, z), the z-axis usually being aligned with the B0, and introduce spatially-distributed variations in frequency and/or phase of the precessing nuclear spins. By applying the radio-frequency B1 magnetic field and gradient fields in carefully devised pulses and/or sequences of pulses that are switched on and off, the RF radiation emitted can carry spatially encoded information that, when detected and analyzed, can be used to produce detailed, high resolution images of the subject or object. Various techniques utilizing both specific pulse sequences and advanced image reconstruction methods have been developed, providing new advances, as well as introducing new challenges.",
                        "An MRI system typically includes hardware components, including a plurality of gradient coils positioned about a bore of a magnet, an RF transceiver system, and an RF switch controlled by a pulse module to transmit RF signals to and receive RF signals from an RF coil assembly. The received RF signals are also known as magnetic resonance (MR) signal data. An MRI system also typically includes a computer programmed to cause the system to apply to an object in the system various RF signals, magnetic fields, and field gradients for inducing spin excitations and spatial encoding in an object, to acquire MR signal data from the object, to process the MR signal data, and to construct an MR image of the object from the processed MR signal data. The computer can include one or more general or special purpose processors, one or more forms of memory, and one or more hardware and/or software interfaces for interacting with and/or controlling other hardware components of the MRI system.",
                        "MR signal data detected from an object are typically described in mathematical terms as \u201ck-space\u201d data (k-space is the Fourier inverse of image or actual space). An image in actual space is produced by a Fourier transform of the k-space data. MR signal data are acquired by traversing k-space over the course of applying to the object the various RF pulses and magnetic field gradients. In practice, techniques for acquiring MR signal data from an object are closely related to techniques for applying the various RF pulses and magnetic field gradients to the object.",
                        "In MRE, external vibrations are introduced into an object, such as biologic tissue, under examination. Vibrations in the tissue (or object) are encoded in the MR signal phase using standard MRI sequences upgraded with motion encoding gradients (MEG). As a result, tissue mechanical parameters can be calculated from the acquired wave fields. In the study of live subjects, the analysis of MRE data with one motion-encoding direction can reveal a correlation of pathophysiological changes and the mechanical behavior of diverse organs. However, difficulties in resolving early disease stages have also become apparent. A step towards a higher diagnostic accuracy is represented by the acquisition of the three-dimensional (3D) displacement field, by which it becomes possible to separate shear from a compression wave by using the curl-operator, and which sets asides any assumptions about the direction of wave propagation in the wave field inversion algorithm.",
                        "In MRE, measurement time may be of interest. Aside from cost factors, long acquisition times may have the potential of decreasing measurement accuracy, since motion may occur and cause misalignment of the images. Further, in conventional 3D MRE, the components of the tissue (or object) displacement are acquired in three individual temporally resolved MRE experiments carried out sequentially in time. Therefore, the components, although attributed to the same point in time, are actually acquired in different physiological states of the subject.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need to improve the method for imaging and analyzing tissue samples using MRE techniques."

As described above, an MRI system typically comprises hardware components including one or more gradient coils positioned about a bore of a magnet, an RF transceiver system, and an RF switch controlled by a pulse module to transmit RF signals to and receive RF signals from an RF coil assembly. The received RF signals are also known as magnetic resonance (MR) signal data. An MRI system also typically includes one or more computers programmed to cause the system to apply to an object in the system various RF signals, magnetic fields, and field gradients for inducing spin excitations and spatial encoding in an object, to acquire MR signal data from the object, to process the MR signal data, and to construct an MR image of the object from the processed MR signal data. The one or more computers can include one or more general or special purpose processors, one or more forms of memory, and one or more hardware and/or software interfaces for interacting with and/or controlling other hardware components of the MRI system.",

Encoding the MR signal phase with vibrational motion yields a signal that carries time-dependent displacement information, which can be recovered and analyzed to determine mechanical properties of the material of the object. The motion-encoded MR signal phase is referred to herein as a \u201cmagnetic resonance elastography\u201d (MRE) signal, and forms a basic element of what is referred to herein as MRE data.

More particularly, the MEG can take the form of one or more MEG cycles of a periodic MEG applied over the course of a MEG application interval, and the MRE signal can be a harmonic function of a start time of a MEG application interval in each dimension. For example, applying the MEG to the object simultaneously in the three spatial dimensions can entail simultaneously applying a respective spatial component of the MEG in a respective temporal sequence of N MEG application intervals in each dimension. The start time of the MEG application interval in each dimension, measured with respect to a particular phase of the mechanical vibration, can be determined according to the dimension and an ordinal position of the given MEG application interval in the respective temporal sequence of the respective spatial component. The different start time in the different dimension can thus manifest as different sampling frequencies in the different spatial dimensions, and the MR signal phase can be encoded with a vibrational displacement in the respective dimension over a time duration of each MEG application interval in each respective dimension.",

Physics in medicine and biology 2007, 52(24):7281-7294) makes use of the spectral values at n>1, these higher order frequency components are typically discarded in conventional mono-frequency MRE. For the acquisition of all components of the displacement vector according to conventional MRE methods, the above procedure is repeated three separate (consecutive) times, while applying the MEG in mutually orthogonal directions in the consecutive steps (Glaser K J, Manduca A, Ehman R L: Review of MR elastography applications and recent developments.

In this approach, the MEGs corresponding to the three spatial directions are applied simultaneously, but with different sampling intervals for the phase shift of the MEG and the respective vibration projection.

The position of the bead is indicated, while the best delineation of the bead from the surrounding is visible in the read-direction. Using SLIM-MRE the stiffness values averaged over the bead were 33.5\u00b19.3 kPa, 22.0\u00b16.3 kPa and 23.3\u00b18.2 kPa for the read-, phase- and s/ice-component, respectively. By comparison, using conventional MRE, the stiffness values averaged over the bead were 33.0\u00b19.7 kPa, 23.1\u00b15.0 kPa and 24.1\u00b14.9 kPa for the read-, phase- and s/ice-component, respectively.",
                                "As shown herein, example embodiments of SLIM-MRE enable acquisition of all three motion components of a single frequency vibration simultaneously. In the demonstration system, the use of eight samples for temporal resolution was sufficient to decompose the three displacement components, which were encoded with different discrete frequencies in the MR signal phase. Accordingly, SLIM-MRE is faster than conventional motion encoding techniques, where four to eight samples are acquired for each component. Since SLIM-MRE is capable of acquiring all components of the 3D displacement vector simultaneously, the technique can be more accurate than conventional motion encoding approaches, where the three projections of the displacement are acquired consecutively in individual experiments. Accordingly SLIM-MRE can also reduce or eliminate the susceptibility of conventional MRE techniques to image mis-registration artifacts generated over time and due to biological motions or different physiological states.",
                                "Results from applying SLIM-MRE example operation with the demonstration system using an inhomogeneous agarose phantom are comparable to conventional MRE, with similar wave images and the same LFE-derived stiffness values, within the error margins. The delineation of the bead from the surrounding gel is most distinct for the read direction, which represents the principle direction of vibration in our setup. While the refraction of shear waves resulted in vibration also along the phase and slice direction within the bead, there was no significant motion visible for these components in the surrounding gel except within the vicinity of the bead. It is inherent to the LFE-technique that the wave motion outside the bead also contributes to the estimated wavelength within the bead. Hence, the standard deviation (SD) of the stiffness within the bead is the highest for the read direction.",
                                "In the example operation, there was no consistent trend in stiffness and SD differences for the individual motion encoding directions between conventional MRE and SLIM-MRE. While the LFE-derived stiffness values were the same within the error margins using both approaches, some reason for the measured differences may be suggested. Concomitant field terms, which are typically present with non-linear spatial dependence, play a role when a linear gradient is activated (Bernstein M A, Thou X H J, Polzin J A, King K F, Ganin A, Pelc N J, Glover G H: Concomitant gradient terms in phase contrast MR: Analysis and correction. Magn Reson Med 1998, 39(2):300-308). In conventional MRE, these terms are imaged on the DC component for a static voxel and on the second harmonic for a vibrating voxel, and thus do not generally interfere with the complex wave image of interest. In SLIM-MRE the second harmonic frequency bin is used for the encoding of one vibration direction and the concomitant field terms can potentially interfere. However, using the first order approximation of the concomitant field given in (Bernstein M A, Zhou X H J, Polzin J A, King K F, Ganin A, Pelc N J, Glover G H: Concomitant gradient terms in phase contrast MR: Analysis and correction. Magn Reson Med 1998, 39(2):300-308), it can be assessed for the demonstration system configuration that the ratio of the concomitant field to the field induced by the gradients is only on the order of 0.8%. Therefore the expected error can be expected to be below the noise level. Also, the concomitant field effects in MRE are removed in phase-difference images calculated from acquisitions with inverse MEG polarities, as was done in the example operation.",
                                "As noted, the demonstration system and example operation used fast spin-echo MR sequence upgraded with motion encoding gradients according to the SLIM-concept. Eight time steps were acquired and the displacement projections were determined for three mutually orthogonal directions that are defined by the gradient coils. It will be appreciated that SLIM-MRE techniques can be extended to more than three directions, given a sufficient number of time steps. SLIM-MRE techniques can also be applicable to any combination of directions. Further, SLIM-MRE is not bound to a specific sequence type, but is applicable to all standard sequences commonly used in MRE, such as spin-echo, gradient-echo, EPI, and spiral based pulse sequences.",
                                "In standard MRE approaches, the start of the vibration is typically shifted relative to the RF pulse, which leaves the MEGs unchanged in individual time steps with respect to the sequence timing. This is different from SLIM-MRE, where the direction-dependent MEG start times can increase the minimum echo time. In the example operation described above, the timing of the vibration relative to the RF pulse was not changed. Rather, temporal resolution was achieved solely by adjusting the MEG timing. Using this approach, the TE has to be increased by 87.5% of the MEG period. This is due to the fact that 7/(8f) corresponds to the latest MEG start time when accounting for periodicity (see FIG. 8). It can be noted that the TE-prolongation can be further reduced. For this purpose, as a first step, the interval between the RF pulse and the earliest start time at each n can be constant, and consequently the vibration can to be shifted with respect to the earliest start time. The TE-increase then accounts for only 62.5% of the MEG period, since the maximum difference between the start times of different MEGs at the same n is equal to 5/(8f), as can be seen in table 802 of FIG. 8 for the case of periodicity. Then as a second step, a symmetry of the phase integral (Equation (5)) can be exploited. Its solution (Equation (10b)) remains unchanged, when the MEG is inverted and its onset is brought forward by half a vibration period. Thus the TE increase can further be reduced to 25%. Some degree of TE-prolongation can be expected to be unavoidable using MEGs with zero phase onset.",
                                "While there can be increase of the minimum echo time of SLIM-MRE compared with conventional MRE, this effect is less relevant in high field, small scale scanners, where multiple MEG cycles are typically applied. In these cases, the SLIM-related prolongation of TE can account for only a fraction of the total MEG duration, which was 17.5% in the demonstration system and example operation discussed herein (because of the use of five MEG cycles per direction and sample). In human studies, however, various MRE protocols use only one MEG cycle, which can result in a TE-increase of 25% of the MEG duration period, when using MEGs with zero phase onset in SLIM-MRE. The effect of decreased signal to phase ratio due to prolonged TE can be compensated for by the use of simultaneous, rapid acquisition in SLIM-MRE.",
                                "In accordance with example embodiments of SLIM-MRE, multidirectional data can even be acquired without increasing the minimum TE compared to conventional MRE. In this case the simultaneous acquisition of all components of the displacement vector can require the sampled MEG start phase to be direction-dependent. This approach would account for temporal resolution by varying the phase \u0398M of the MEG at its start time (Equation (10a)) and not by shifting the start s of the MEG the vibration relative to the vibration (Equation (10b)). While mathematically equivalent with respect to the modulation of the sample interval, the applied MEGs might possess different gradient moment nulling characteristics at the temporally-resolved images. More precisely, the displacement projection at one sample might be flow-compensated using a cosine-shaped MEG, flow-uncompensated using a sinus-shaped MEG or a mixture of both, when the MEG start phase is neither zero, nor a multiple of \u03c0/2.",
                                "A comparison of SLIM-MRE and conventional MRE on an inhomogeneous gel sample using a high field vertical MRI system gave the same LFE-derived stiffness values within the error margins, while reducing the necessary number of temporally-resolved MRE experiments from three to one.",
