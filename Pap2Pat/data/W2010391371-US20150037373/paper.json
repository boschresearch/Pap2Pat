    "title": "An orally active immune adjuvant prepared from cones of Pinus sylvestris, enhances the proliferative phase of a primary T cell response",
    "date": "2014-05-22",
    "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that an alkaline extract of shredded pinecones yields a polyphenylpropanoid polysaccharide complex (PPC) that functions as an orally active immune adjuvant. Specifically, oral PPC can boost the number of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells generated in response to a variety of vaccine types (DNA, protein, and dendritic cell) and bias the response towards one that is predominately a T helper 1 type.An immune response was initiated by intraperitoneal injection of mice with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). A group of mice received PPC by gavage three times per day on Days 0 and 1. The draining lymph nodes were analyzed 48-96 h post-injection for the numbers of reactive T cells, cytokine production, the generation of reactive oxygen species, and apoptotsis.In this study we examined whether the ability of PPC to boost a T cell response is due to an effect on the proliferative or contraction phases, or both, of the primary response. We present data to demonstrate that oral PPC significantly enhances the primary T cell response by affecting the expansion of T cells (both CD4 and CD8) during the proliferative phase, while having no apparent effects on the activation-induced cell death associated with the contraction phase.These findings suggest that PPC could potentially be utilized to enhance the T cell response generated by a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines designed to target a cellular response.",

                "The health benefits of a pinecone extract were first documented by Pedanius Dioscorides [1]. Dioscorides (ca. 40-ca. 90) was an ancient Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist who practiced in ancient Rome. In about AD 65, after much direct observation of plants in their native habitats and careful practical experience on the medicinal uses of herbs, he wrote De Materia Medica. De Materia Medica is a precursor to all modern pharmacopeias and is one of the most influential herbal books in history. Within the Materia Medica, Dioscorides describes using extracts of pinecones to treat kidney and digestive ailments and to apply to the skin to treat a disease that appears to have been psoriasis.",
                "For much of the last century, the Japanese inhabitants of the island of Kyushu have also known about the medicinal properties of a pinecone extract [2]. They have used an aqueous extract (tea) prepared from pinecones to treat illnesses ranging from infectious disease to cancer. Because of the indigenous beliefs that the pinecone tea was able to treat such a wide variety of illnesses, it appeared to us that the effects of the extract were very likely being mediated through the immune system.",
                "Previous studies indicate that an orally active polyphenylpropanoid polysaccharide complex (PPC) derived from the cones of Pinus sylvestris not only biases the immune response initiated by DNA, protein, or dendritic cell vaccines towards one that is predominately a T helper type 1 (Th1), it also significantly enhances the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells detected during a secondary T cell response [3]. In vitro studies have revealed that the exposure of human PBMC [4] or murine bone marrow cells [5] to PPC rapidly induces the production of dendritic-like cells.",
                "The ability to induce a predominant Th1 response when delivered at the time of immunization is coupled with the ability to suppress the development of an antigen-specific Th2 response [3]. Oral delivery of PPC at the time of immunization with the model Th2 antigen, chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA), blocks the development of an IgE-mediate allergic response to OVA. In vitro this is detected as an inability of OVA-stimulated splenocytes to produce IL-4 while producing significantly elevated amounts of IFN\u03b3 [3]. When the levels of OVA-specific CD8+/IFN\u03b3+ T cells in these mice are measured by ELISPOT, the mice receiving PPC at the time of immunization consistently yield twice as many of these cells [3].",
                "With the continual accumulation of anecdotal reports suggesting that use of PPC along with traditional anti-cancer therapies somehow enhances the ability to mount an effective anti-cancer response, we are motivated to better understand PPC's mechanism of action. In the study described herein, we determined that PPC\u2019s association with an increased number of antigen-specific CD8+ CTL activated during a secondary T cell response is very likely due to its ability to significantly enhance the expansion of these cells during the early phase of the primary T cell response and not by affecting the contraction phase or rate of activated induced cell death."

The number of cell subsets per lymph node was obtained from the set of pooled inguinal lymph nodes and then dividing that number by two. To calculate the total number of cell subsets per lymph node, the percent of each subset was multiplied by the total number of cells isolated from the lymph nodes.

However, the numbers of CD3+/CD8+/V\u03b28+ T-cells remained elevated in both the SEB (Figure\u00a03, right panel; p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared to the Na\u00efve group) and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC treated groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05 when compared to the SEB group). This seemingly enhanced susceptibility of CD4+ cells to activation induced cell death (AICD) has been reported by others and is not specific for the response to superantigens [8,9]. As observed in the 48\u00a0h samples, treatment with PPC was associated with a significant increase in CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells when compared to the samples from mice receiving only the SEB injection (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Figure\u00a03, right panel)."

                        "Hildeman et al. revealed that the ROS production by T cells activated with SEB results in the suppression of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression [11]. The suppression of Bcl-2 expression reduces the Bcl-2/Bim ratio and allows unbound Bim to interact with Bax and create the apoptosome [12]. If T cells are activated in the presence of an antioxidant the levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein increase and lead to significant inhibition of ACID [13]. Since PPC appeared to have reduced the levels of ROS in SEB activated T cells, we sought to determine if this was also associated with a concomitant increase in Bcl-2 mRNA or protein expression. While PPC appeared to enhance the percentage of CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells positive for the intracellular expression Bcl-2 protein (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Figure\u00a06A), this was found to be due to the increased number of CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the PPC-treated mice rather than an increase in the level of Bcl-2 protein per cell (Figure\u00a06B). When individual V\u03b28+ T cells were examined, the T cells from mice in both the SEB and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC groups contained equally reduced amounts of intracellular Bcl-2 protein (Figure\u00a06B). Bcl-2 levels in V\u03b28 negative cells appeared not to be affected by SEB or SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC (Figure\u00a06C). These results suggest that the reduction of ROS levels detected in the SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC-treated mice was not likely to have affected the induction of apoptosis.The reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels in the SEB and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC groups was paralleled by a reduction in the levels of Bcl-2 specific mRNA detected in the lymph nodes (Figure\u00a07A). The treatment of na\u00efve mice with PPC only also resulted in a reduction in the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA. This would suggest that PPC most likely does not function as an antioxidant in vivo and exerts little effect on the pattern of activation induced apoptosis."

In the SEB and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC treated mice we observed no significant effect of PPC on the levels of the Bcl-3 mRNA (Figure\u00a07A). This also suggested that PPC was not affecting the expression of anti-apoptosis genes.",
                        "However, there was observed an almost 4-fold increase in Bcl-3 mRNA in the lymph nodes of mice treated with only PPC (Figure\u00a07B). In the study by Mitchell et al. [15] neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL expression in T cells was found to be correlated with activation induced survival (AIS). In their paper further analysis showed that neither the extent of T cell proliferation nor the reactive oxygen content of T cells was affected in a way that could explain AIS. Finally, they showed that microarray analyses pointed toward the expression of Bcl-3 as an important mediator of AIS in T cells [15]. Our results suggest that while PPC can enhance expression of Bcl-3 mRNA in na\u00efve mice, it apparently cannot influence Bcl-3 expression in SEB-activated T cells.While the mRNA levels for the pro-apoptosis protein, Bax, did not appear to be significantly affected by SEB or SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC treatment (Figure\u00a07A), the levels of mRNA for the pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 binding protein, Bim, were found to be elevated almost 4-fold in the lymph nodes from mice 48\u00a0h after treatment with SEB or SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC (Figure\u00a07A). The administration of PPC alone did not appear to affect the expression of Bim (Figure\u00a07B). These observations support the conclusion that the pattern of AICD is clearly detected in the SEB treated mice and that administration of PPC to these mice does not appear to significantly suppress the activation induced apoptosis associated with the contraction phase of T cell activation."

[3] describes the ability of orally administered PPC to consistently double the number of antigen-specific CD8+/IFN\u03b3+ T cells detected during secondary T cell responses in mice that had been immunized with either a DNA, protein or dendritic cell vaccine. All of these T cell responses were measured at times long after the primary response had waned and memory cells had been established [3]. In order to determine if PPC\u2019s activity is specific for the secondary response, we sought to examine its effect on the development of a primary T cell response. To do so, we utilized the well-established SEB model of T cell activation.",
                "When SEB is presented by MHC II bearing APC to V\u03b28+ T cells, the T cells become activated, begin proliferating, and undergo differentiation. This takes place without the need for antigen processing by the APC. When we examined the effects of oral PPC on the SEB-mediated V\u03b28+ T cell expansion we detected significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ V\u03b28+ T cells in the lymph nodes of mice that had been treated with SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC. In fact, we again observed a doubling of the number of CD4+/V\u03b28+ and CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the lymph nodes of PPC treated mice (Figure\u00a02). Interestingly, treatment of mice with oral PPC alone appeared to have no effect on T cell expansion (Figure\u00a02). These observations suggest that the PPC effect we previously observed during the secondary T cell response is likely to due to PPC\u2019s ability to affect the primary response.",
                "By 96\u00a0h post SEB injection, when the activated T cells are in the midst of contraction, the CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the SEB treated mice had already contracted to levels lower than those found in the lymph nodes of naive mice while the levels of CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC treated mice were still significantly higher than those found in the mice treated with SEB alone (Figure\u00a03). This finding of an apparent increased contraction rate in the activated CD4+ T cells has been previously described and was therefore expected [8,9,16]. However, the fact that the resulting enhanced expansion of the SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC stimulated CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cell population did not lead to an enhanced number of CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cells surviving the contraction is curious (Figure\u00a03A). We believe that this observation could be explained by the findings of Liu and Janeway [17], Noble et al. [18], Florido et al. [19], and Atsumi et al. [20]. Their reports describe a strong link between the production of IFN\u03b3 by activated CD8+ T cells and the induction of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cell apoptosis. Therefore, the increase in serum IFN\u03b3 levels that we detected (Figure\u00a04) could potentially result in a more extensive induction of apoptosis in the CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cell population.",
                "There have been reports suggesting that the production of reactive oxygen species by activated T cells is responsible for the induction of apoptosis [12], [21]. Specifically, it has been shown that the ROS associated with T cell activation works by down regulating the activity of the anti-apoptosis protein, Bcl-2 [12]. Since levels of Bcl-2 within cells are critical for anti-apoptotic activity, decreasing Bcl-2 sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Antioxidants capable of scavenging the ROS have been shown to be able to prevent the ROS-induced down regulation of Bcl-2 and prevent activation induced apoptosis [12].",
                "In 2003, Philippa Marrack\u2019s laboratory discovered that culturing activated T cells (48\u00a0hr post SEB treatment) with the peroxynitrite scavenger, MnTBAP, reversed the ROS-induced decline in Bcl-2. They also demonstrated that the pro-apoptosis protein Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) is required for SEB-driven T cell death and that it is the ROS-induced down regulation of Bcl-2 that leads to increased levels of free Bim. It is the free Bim that alters the mitochondrial membrane potential and activates the apoptosis pathway [12]. Therefore, suppression of the ROS in activated T cells should lead to the production of enough Bcl-2 to bind to Bim and prevent activation of the apoptosis pathway.",
                "Since PPC contains polyphenolics with antioxidant properties [22], we sought to determine if PPC was affecting the generation of ROS by the SEB-activated T cells. As shown in Figure\u00a05, orally administered PPC was able to reduce the ROS levels in the lymph node CD3+ T cell population. When we examined the levels of intracellular Bcl-2 in the V\u03b28+ T lymph node T cells, we found that PPC had no effect on SEB\u2019s suppression of Bcl-2 expression. The T cells from both the SEB and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC treated mice had less Bcl-2 per cell than did the cells from the naive control animals (Figure\u00a06). This suggests that the observed decrease in ROS levels by PPC were probably not significant enough to affect the expression of Bcl-2. When the CD3+/V\u03b28- T cells (cells that should not be activated by SEB) were examined there was found to be no difference between the intracellular levels of Bcl-2 in the lymph nodes from the Naive mice and the SEB or SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC groups (Figure\u00a06C). The lack of an effect by SEB on the CD3+/V\u03b28- cells demonstrates the specificity of SEB for T cells expressing the V\u03b28+ variant of the T cell receptor.",
                "The reduction of intracellular Bcl-2 protein levels detected in the SEB and SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC groups was paralleled by changes in the mRNA levels for Bcl-2 (Figure\u00a07A). In the same cells we found that while SEB suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2, it enhanced expression of the pro-apoptosis gene, Bim, by more than 3 fold (Figure\u00a07A). These results are in agreement with those of Hildeman et al. [11] and indicate that activation induced apoptosis had already begun to occur 48\u00a0h after injection of the SEB.",
                "Activation of cell apoptosis at the 48\u00a0h time point was verified by Annexin V staining. Cells undergoing apoptosis can be identified by their ability to bind fluorescently labeled Annexin V. When compared with the T cells from the Naive mice, SEB significantly enhanced the percentage of Annexin V positive V\u03b28+ T cells (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Administration of PPC to the SEB treated mice failed to alter SEB\u2019s ability to enhance the expression of Annexin V (Figure\u00a08). When combined with the other indicators of activation induced cell death, it appears that PPC has no significant effect on the contraction phase of the primary T cell response."

Previous reports from our laboratory demonstrated that the in vitro exposure of human PBMC [4] and murine bone marrow cells [5] to PPC enhances the production and maturation of dendritic cells. If PPC is able to similarly affect dendritic cells in vivo it is possible that this could result in enhanced activation and proliferation of the SEB-specific T cells. Another possibility is that PPC could be enhancing dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes. The presence of an increased number of dendritic cells would allow for the presentation of SEB to a larger number of T cells. Since not all V\u03b28+ T cells proliferate in response to an SEB injection [23], an increase in the number of dendritic cells presenting SEB in the lymph nodes could result in an increased number of activated T cells. In fact, preliminary results have detected an increase in the number of CD11c+ cells in the lymph nodes of mice treated with SEB\u2009+\u2009PPC (data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which PPC enhances the proliferative phase of a primary T cell response."
