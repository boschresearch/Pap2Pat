                        "As part of the indigenous folk medicine in Japan, aqueous extracts of pinecones have been used for to treat cancer and other illnesses and references to their use can be found in ancient Greek literature. However, the mechanisms by which such extracts work are largely unknown. (The health benefits of a pinecone extract were first documented by Pedanius Dioscorides (Gunther, R T. in The Greek herbal of Dioscorides. illustrated by a Byzantine A. D. 512; englished by John Goodyer A. D. 1655; edited and first printed A. D. 1933 by Robert T. Gunther. (Hafner Publishing Co., New York, 1968). Dioscorides (ca. 40-ca. 90) was an ancient Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist who practiced in ancient Rome. In about AD 65, after much direct observation of plants in their native habitats and careful practical experience on the medicinal uses of herbs, he wrote De Materia Medica. De Materia Medica is a precursor to all modern pharmacopeias and is one of the most influential herbal books in history. Within the Materia Medica, Dioscorides describes using extracts of pinecones to treat kidney and digestive ailments and to apply to the skin to treat a disease that appears to have been psoriasis.",
                        "For much of the last century, the Japanese inhabitants of the island of Kyushu have also known about the medicinal properties of a pinecone extract (Sakagami HOURS, Konno K, Kawazoe Y, Lai P, Nonoyama M. (1992) Multiple immunological functions of extracts from the cone of Japanese white pine, Pinus parviflora Sieb. et Zucc. Adv Exp Med Biol 319: 331.). They have used an aqueous extract (tea) prepared from pinecones to treat illnesses ranging from infectious disease to cancer. Because of the indigenous beliefs that the pinecone tea was able to treat such a wide variety of illnesses, it appeared to us that the effects of the extract were very likely being mediated through the immune system.",
                        "Previous studies indicate that an orally active polyphenylpropanoid polysaccharide complex (PPC) derived from the cones of Pinus sylvestris not only biases the immune response initiated by DNA, protein, or dendritic cell vaccines towards one that is predominately a T helper type 1 (Th1), it also significantly enhances the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells detected during a secondary T cell response (Burrows, M, Assundani D, Celis E, Tufaro F, Tanaka A, and W G Bradley. 2009. Oral Administration of PPC enhances antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses while reducing IgE levels in sensitized mice. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9: 49, incorporated herein by reference). In vitro studies have revealed that the exposure of human PBMC (Bradley W G, Widen R H, Weiser A M, Powers J J, Fountain L B, Punjwani P, Lofgren S M, Hadzic T, Klein R, Green W H, Tanaka A. (2003) The novel differentiation of human blood mononuclear cells into CD1a-negative dendritic cells is stimulated in the absence of exogenous cytokines by an extract prepared from pinecones. Int Immunopharmacol 3: 209, incorporated herein by reference) or murine bone marrow cells (An W W, Kanazawa Y, Ozawa M, Nakaya K, Saito T, Tanaka A, Bradley W G. (2010) Dendritic cell differentiation and tumor cell apoptosis induced by components of a polyphenylpropanoid polysaccharide complex. Anticancer Res. 30:613, incorporated herein by reference) to PPC rapidly induces the production of dendritic-like cells.",
                        "The ability to induce a predominant Th1 response when delivered at the time of immunization is coupled with the ability to suppress the development of an antigen-specific Th2 response (Burrows et al.). Oral delivery of PPC at the time of immunization with the model Th2 antigen, chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA), blocks the development of an IgE mediate allergic response to OVA. In vitro this is detected as an inability of OVA stimulated splenocytes to produce IL-4 while producing significantly elevated amounts of IFNg (Burrows, et al.). When the levels of OVA-specific CD8+/IFNg+ T cells in these mice are measured by ELISPOT, the mice receiving PPC at the time of immunization consistently yield twice as many of these cells (Burrows, et al.).",
                        "It appears that use of PPC along with traditional anti-cancer therapies somehow enhances the ability to mount an effective anti-cancer response. According, what is needed is an understanding of PPC's mechanism of action."

                        "This invention builds on, and is an improvement upon, the inventor's previous work described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0142833, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Here, demonstrate whether the ability of PPC to boost a T cell response is due to an effect on the proliferative or contraction phases, or both, of the primary response. The examples below demonstrate that oral PPC significantly enhances the primary T cell response by affecting the expansion of T cells (both CD4 and CD8) during the proliferative phase, while having no apparent effects on the activation-induced cell death associated with the contraction phase.",
                        "Moreover, this work demonstrates that the oral administration of a standardized pinecone extract, concurrent with an immunization, significantly boosts the resulting primary immune response and does so by enhancing proliferation of the antigen-specific T cells without affecting the rate of activated T cell death. These findings show that the medicinal benefits include the ability of the pinecone extract to boost a T cell immune response directed against cancer cells.",
                        "In the study described herein, the inventors demonstrate that PPC's association with an increased number of antigen-specific CD8+ CTL activated during a secondary T cell response is due to its ability to significantly enhance the expansion of these cells during the early phase of the primary T cell response and not by affecting the contraction phase or rate of activated induced cell death.",
                        "Orally administered PPC has the ability to consistently double the number of antigen-specific CD8+/IFNg+ T cells detected during secondary T cell responses in mice that had been immunized with either a DNA, protein or dendritic cell vaccine (Burrows et al. (Burrows, et al.)). All of these T cell responses were measured at times long after the primary response had waned and memory cells had been established (Burrows, et al.). In order to determine if PPC's activity is specific for the secondary response, the inventors sought to examine its effect on the development of a primary T cell response. To do so, the inventors utilized the well-established SEB model of T cell activation.",
                        "When SEB is presented by MHC II bearing APC to V\u03b28+ T cells, the T cells become activated, begin proliferating, and undergo differentiation. This takes place without the need for antigen processing by the APC. When the inventors examined the effects of oral PPC on the SEB-mediated V\u03b28+ T cell expansion they detected significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ V\u03b28+ T cells in the lymph nodes of mice that had been treated with SEB+PPC. In fact, the inventors again observed a doubling of the number of CD4+/V\u03b28+ and CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the lymph nodes of PPC treated mice (FIG. 2). Interestingly, treatment of mice with oral PPC alone appeared to have no effect on T cell expansion (FIG. 2). These observations suggest that the PPC effect the inventors previously observed during the secondary T cell response is likely to due to PPC's ability to affect the primary response.",
                        "By 96 hours post SEB injection, when the activated T cells are in the midst of contraction, the CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the SEB treated mice had already contracted to levels lower than those found in the lymph nodes of naive mice while the levels of CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the SEB+PPC treated mice were still significantly higher than those found in the mice treated with SEB alone (FIG. 3). This finding of an apparent increased contraction rate in the activated CD4+ T cells has been previously described and was therefore expected (MacDonald, HOURS. R., R. K. Lees, S. Baschieri, T. Herrmann, and A. T. Lussow. (1993) Peripheral T-cell reactivity to bacterial superantigens in vivo: the response/anergy paradox. Immunol. Rev. 133:105; Scott, D. E., W. J. Kisch, and A. D. Steinberg. (1993) Studies of T cell deletion and T cell energy following in vivo administration of SEB to normal and lupus prone mice. J. Immunol. 150:664; Gonzalo J A, Martinez C, Springer T A, Gutierrez-Ramos J C. (1995) ICAM-1 is required for T cell proliferation but not for anergy or apoptosis induced by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B in vivo. Int Immunol. 7:1691; which are incorporated herein by reference).",
                        "However, the fact that the resulting enhanced expansion of the SEB+PPC stimulated CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cell population did not lead to an enhanced number of CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cells surviving the contraction is curious (FIG. 3b). The inventors believe that this observation could be explained by the findings of Liu and Janeway (Liu Y, Janeway C A Jr. (1990) Interferon gamma plays a critical role in induced cell death of effector T cell: a possible third mechanism of self-tolerance. J Exp Med. 172:1735; Noble, A., Pestano, G. A. and Cantor, H. (1998). Suppression of immune responses by CD8 cells. I.

(2009) IFN-gamma expression in CD8+ T cells regulated by IL-6 signal is involved in superantigen-mediated CD4+ T cell death. Int Immunol. 21:73).",
                        "Their reports describe a strong link between the production of IFNg by activated CD8+ T cells and the induction of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cell apoptosis. Therefore, the increase in serum IFNg levels that the inventors detected (FIG. 4) could potentially result in a more extensive induction of apoptosis in the CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cell population. There have been reports suggesting that the production of reactive oxygen species by activated T cells is responsible for the induction of apoptosis (Hildeman D A, Mitchell T, Kappler J, Marrack P. (2003) T cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. J Clin Invest. 111:575; Hildeman, D A, Mitchell, T, Teague, T K, Henson, P, Day, B J, Kappler, J, & Marrack, P C. (1999). Reactive Oxygen Species Regulate Activation-Induced T Cell Apoptosis. Immunity. 10:735). Specifically, it has been shown that the ROS associated with T cell activation works by down regulating the activity of the anti-apoptosis protein, Bcl-2 (Hildeman, et al, 2003). Since levels of Bcl-2 within cells are critical for anti-apoptotic activity, decreasing Bcl-2 sensitizes cells to apoptosis.",
                        "Antioxidants capable of scavenging the ROS have been shown to be able to prevent the ROS-induced down regulation of Bcl-2 and prevent activation induced apoptosis (Hildeman, et al, 2003). In 2003, Philippa Marrack's laboratory discovered that culturing activated T cells (48 hr post SEB treatment) with the peroxynitrite scavenger, MnTBAP, reversed the ROS induced decline in Bcl-2. They also demonstrated that the pro-apoptosis protein Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) is required for SEB-driven T cell death and that it is the ROS-induced down regulation of Bcl-2 that leads to increased levels of free Bim. It is the free Bim that alters the mitochondrial membrane potential and activates the apoptosis pathway (Hildeman, et al, 2003). Therefore, suppression of the ROS in activated T cells should lead to the production of enough Bcl-2 to bind to Bim and prevent activation of the apoptosis pathway.",
                        "Since PPC contains polyphenolics with antioxidant properties (Satoh K, Kihara T, Ida Y, Sakagami H, Koyama N, Premanathan M, Arakaki R, Nakashima H, Komatsu N, Fujimaki M, Misawa Y, Hata N. (1999) Radical modulation activity of pine cone extracts of Pinus elliottii var. Elliottii. Anticancer Res. 19:357), the inventors sought to determine if PPC was affecting the generation of ROS by the SEB-activated T cells. As shown in FIG. 5, orally administered PPC was able to reduce the ROS levels in the lymph node CD3+ T cell population. When the inventors examined the levels of intracellular Bcl-2 in the V\u03b28+ T lymph node T cells, the inventors found that PPC had no effect on SEB's suppression of Bcl-2 expression. The T cells from both the SEB and SEB+PPC treated mice had less Bcl-2 per cell than did the cells from the naive control animals (FIG. 6). This suggests that the observed decrease in ROS levels by PPC were probably not significant enough to affect the expression of Bcl-2. When the CD3+/V\u03b28\u2212 T cells (cells that should not be activated by SEB) were examined there was found to be no difference between the intracellular levels of Bcl-2 in the lymph nodes from the Naive mice and the SEB or SEB+PPC groups (FIG. 6 lower panel). The lack of an effect by SEB on the CD3+ V\u03b28\u2212 cells demonstrates the specificity of SEB for T cells expressing the V\u03b28+ variant of the T cell receptor.",
                        "The reduction of intracellular Bcl-2 protein levels detected in the SEB and SEB+PPC groups was paralleled by changes in the mRNA levels for Bcl-2 (FIG. 7). In the same cells the inventors found that while SEB suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, it enhanced expression of the pro-apoptosis gene for Bim by more than 3 fold (FIG. 7).",
                        "These results are in agreement with those of Hildeman et al. (2002) (Hildeman, D A, Zhu, Y, Mitchell, T C, Bouillet, P, Strasser, A, Kappler, J, Marrack, P. (2002). Activated T Cell Death In Vivo Mediated by Proapoptotic Bcl-2 Family Member Bim. Immunity. 16:759) and indicate that activation induced apoptosis had already begun to occur 48 h after injection of the SEB. Activation of cell apoptosis at the 48 h time point was verified by Annexin V staining. Cells undergoing apoptosis can be identified by their ability to bind fluorescently labeled Annexin V. When compared with the T cells from the Naive mice, SEB significantly enhanced the percentage of Annexin V positive V\u03b28+ T cells (p<0.001). Administration of PPC to the SEB treated mice failed to alter SEB's ability to enhance the expression of Annexin V (FIG. 8). When combined with the other indicators of activation induced cell death, it appears that PPC has no significant effect on the contraction phase of the primary T cell response.",
                        "Therefore, PPC's ability to double the number the antigen-specific CD8+ T cells detected in a secondary immune response following immunization with either DNA, protein, or dendritic cell vaccines appears to be associated with enhancement of the proliferative phase of the primary T cell response. Previous reports from the inventor's laboratory demonstrated that the in vitro exposure of human PBMC (Bradley, et al) and murine bone marrow cells (An, et al) to PPC enhances the production and maturation of dendritic cells. If PPC is able to similarly affect dendritic cells in vivo it is possible that this could result in enhanced activation and proliferation of the SEB-specific T cells. Another possibility is that PPC could be enhancing dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes. The presence of an increased number of dendritic cells would allow for the presentation of SEB to a larger number of T cells. Since not all V\u03b28+ T cells proliferate in response to an SEB injection (Renno T, Hahne M., MacDonald H R. (1995). Proliferation is a prerequisite for bacterial superantigen-induced T cell apoptosis in vivo. J Exp Med. 181:2283) an increase in the number of dendritic cells presenting SEB in the lymph nodes could result in an increased number of activated T cells. In fact, preliminary results have detected an increase in the number of CD11c+ cells in the lymph nodes of mice treated with SEB+PPC (data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which PPC enhances the proliferative phase of a primary T cell response."

                                "Previous studies have shown that the injection of SEB specifically induces the proliferation of murine CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner during a primary T cell response (FIG. 1) (Newell, K A, Ellenhorn, J D Bruce, D S and Bluestonem, J A. (1991) In vivo t-cell activation by staphylococcal enterotoxin B prevents outgrowth of a malignant tumor. Immunology 88:1074). To determine if PPC would enhance this proliferative response to SEB, mice (3 per group) were divided into four experimental groups. While the na\u00efve groups received no treatment, the SEB group received an i.p. injection of 100 \u03bcg SEB on Day 0, and the SEB+PPC group received an i.p. injection of SEB on Day 0 that was immediately followed by gavage with 100 \u03bcL of a 200 \u03bcg/mL solution of PPC. This gavage was repeated two more times on Day 0 and then three times (10 am, 1 pm, and 4 pm) on Day 1. Starting on Day 0 the mice were also supplied 200 \u03bcg/mL PPC in their water ad libitum. PPC was also supplied in this manner to the PPC only group of mice. This experimental protocol was repeated several times for durations of 48 hours to determine if PPC affected cell activity during the proliferation phase of the primary T cell response.",
                                "At the height of T cell proliferation, 48 hours post SEB injection, significantly more CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells were isolated from the inguinal lymph nodes of mice treated with SEB+PPC (FIG. 2a, p<0.05). This PPC associated enhancement of lymph node T cells was detected in both the CD4+/V\u03b28+ (p<0.01) and CD8+/V\u03b28+ populations (p<0.01) (FIG. 2b and c, respectively). Interestingly, administration of PPC alone had no effect on the numbers of CD3+/, CD4+/, or CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells (p>0.05 for all three populations of V\u03b28+ T cells when comparing Naive versus PPC only) (FIG. 2).",

                                "Separate groups of mice were treated as described above and then at the peak of the contraction phase (FIG. 1), 96 h post i.p. injection of 100 \u03bcg SEB, the inguinal lymph node V\u03b28+ T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry to determine if oral delivery of PPC affected this phase of the primary response. As shown in FIG. 3 (left panel), by 96 hours the numbers of CD3+/CD4+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the SEB and SEB+PPC groups had contracted to levels no different than that found in the Naive group (p>0.05). However, the numbers of CD3+/CD8+/V\u03b28+ T-cells remained elevated in both the SEB (FIG. 3, right panel; p<0.01 compared to the Naive group) and SEB+PPC treated groups (p<0.05 when compared to the SEB group). This seemingly enhanced susceptibility of CD4+ cells to activation induced cell death (AICD) has been reported by others and is not specific for the response to superantigens (MacDonald, et al; Scott et al). As observed in the 48 h samples, treatment with PPC was associated with a significant increase in CD8+/V\u03b28+ T cells when compared to the samples from mice receiving only the SEB injection (p<0.05, FIG. 3, right panel).",

The results reveal that immunization with SEB resulted in the significant increase in the serum levels of all three cytokines (FIG. 4). The serum from mice receiving PPC along with the SEB immunization were found to have less IL-2 (p<0.05), more IFNg (p<0.005), and no significant change in the levels of IL-12p70 (FIG. 4).",

And S. Jain. (2000) Oxidative stress and apoptosis. Pathophysiology 7:153), the levels of ROS in the lymph node T cells from each of the treatment groups were determined. As shown in FIG. 4 (left panel), oral delivery of PPC significantly reduced the percentage of CD3+/ROS+ T cells obtained from SEB treated mice (p<0.01) and significantly reduced the levels of ROS per individual CD3+ T cells (FIG. 4, right panel). This would suggest that molecules in PPC might be functioning as antioxidants in vivo. If this is true, PPC could be affecting the ability of ROS to induce apoptosis in the activated T cells. For these reasons the expression of several apoptosis related genes was investigated.",

The suppression of Bcl-2 expression reduces the Bcl-2/Bim ratio and allows unbound Bim to interact with Bax and create the apoptosome (Hildeman, et al, 2003). If T cells are activated in the presence of an antioxidant the levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein increase and lead to significant inhibition of ACID (Brunelle J K, Letai A. (2009) Control of mitochondrial apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family. J Cell Sci. 122(Pt 4):437).",
                                "Since PPC appeared to have reduced the levels of ROS in SEB activated T cells, the inventors sought to determine if this was also associated with a concomitant increase in Bcl-2 mRNA or protein expression. While PPC appeared to enhance the percentage of CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells positive for the intracellular expression Bcl-2 protein (p<0.05; FIG. 5, left panel), this was found to be due to the increased number of CD3+/V\u03b28+ T cells in the PPC-treated mice rather than an increase in the level of Bcl-2 protein per cell (FIG. 4b). When individual V\u03b28+ T cells were examined, the T cells from mice in both the SEB and SEB+PPC groups contained equally reduced amounts of intracellular Bcl-2 protein (FIG. 4b).",
                                "These results suggest that the reduction of ROS levels detected in the SEB+PPC-treated mice was not likely to have affected the induction of apoptosis. The reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels in the SEB and SEB+PPC groups was paralleled by a reduction in the levels of Bcl-2 specific mRNA detected in the lymph nodes (FIG. 5a). Interestingly, treatment of mice with PPC only also lead to a reduction in Bcl-2 mRNA levels (FIG. 5b). This would suggest that PPC most likely does not affect the normal pattern of activation induced apoptosis.",

Cutting Edge: Bcl-3 Upregulation by signal 3 cytokine (IL-12) prolongs survival of antigen-activated CD8 T cells. J Immunol 174:600). In the SEB and SEB+PPC treated mice the inventors observed no significant effect of PPC on the levels of the Bcl-3 mRNA (FIG. 5a). This also suggested that PPC was not affecting the expression of anti-apoptosis genes.",

(Mitchell, et al) neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL expression in T cells was found to be correlated with activation induced survival (AIS). Further analysis showed that neither the extent of T cell proliferation nor the reactive oxygen content of T cells was affected in a way that could explain AIS. Finally, microarray analyses pointed toward the expression of Bcl-3 as an important mediator of AIS in T cells (Mitchell T C, Teague T K, Hildeman D A, Bender J, Rees W A, Kedl R M, Swanson B, Kappler J W, Marrack P.

However, there was no difference (p>0.05) in the levels of apoptosis in the cells isolated from the SEB or SEB+PPC groups of mice.
