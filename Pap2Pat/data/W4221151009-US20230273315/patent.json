                        "Development of digital world is important because it can enrich people's lives by enabling augmented reality, virtual reality, smart city, robots, autonomous driving, etc. in the digital world. Humans and environments are two main components for creating the digital world. Current research tends to separate dynamic human motions from static environments to help improve capture accuracy of both the human motions and the environments. To capture human motions, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are widely used and be mounted on different parts of human body, like arms, legs, feet, head, etc. The IMU sensors can capture accurate short-term motions but can suffer from drift with increasing acquisition time. Conventional methods tend to utilize external cameras as a remedy to improve accuracy, but these methods can result in limited capture space, human activities, and interactions. For example, Human POSEiting System (HPS) uses a head-mounted camera, which looks outwards like human eyes, to complement IMU sensors in global localization. Without constraints of external cameras, HPS can recover full-body pose and register the human wearing the HPS in large 3D scans of real scenes. However, the HPS requires pre-built maps and a large image database for self-localization, which are not ideal for capturing large scenes. As such, conventional methods are not ideally suited to capture scenes from large-scale spaces."

                        "For accurate localization and mapping, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is the most applicable sensor. LiDAR sensors are popular and extensively used in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicle applications. LiDAR sensors are also extensively used for large-scale scene captures. Although there are many LiDAR-captured datasets, including indoor scenes and large-scale outdoor scenes, these datasets generally focus on scene understanding and 3D perception, while ignoring accurate human poses. For example, a PedX dataset provides 3D poses of pedestrians by using skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL) parameterization for joint locations of instances (e.g., objects, humans) on third-person-view images. The 3D poses of the PedX dataset are not accurate as poses measured by IMU sensors. Furthermore, the PedX dataset focuses on traffic scenes and, thus, is not applicable for generating diverse 3D human motions.",
                        "Described herein are inventions that address the problems described above. In various embodiments, the inventions can comprise a motion and scene capturing system. The motion and scene capturing system can comprise a plurality of IMU sensors and a LiDAR sensor. The plurality of IMU sensors and the LiDAR sensor can be worn by a human to capture human motion while simultaneously providing localization and scene capture. By taking advantage of IMU-based motion caption and LiDAR-based localization and scene capture, a dataset, namely a Human-centered 4D Scene Capture (HSC4D) dataset, can be generated to accurately and efficiently create a dynamic digital world with consecutive human motions in indoor-outdoor scenes. Using only body-mounted sensors, the HSC4D dataset is not limited or dependent on particular spaces, poses, interactions between humans, or environments. Further, the HSC4D dataset makes it possible to capture most of human-involved real-world scenes. Compared with camera-based localization, LiDAR-based localization is more precise for global localization, which can dramatically reduce drifts of IMU sensors. Further, unlike camera-based localization, LiDAR-based localization does not need pre-built maps. Moreover, IMU sensors can improve accuracy of LiDAR-captured local trajectories, where errors are caused by body jitters. As such, making use of both IMU sensors and a LiDAR sensor, a joint optimization can be performed to improve performance of motion estimation and human-scene mapping by considering several physical constraints. The inventions described herein use only body-mounted IMU and LiDAR sensors. Therefore, unlike conventional methods, capturing human motions and large scale scenes are not limited by devices' constraints and any pre-built maps, thereby achieving long-term human motion capture. In some cases, depending on battery capacity powering the body-mounted IMU and LiDAR sensor, the time for motion capture can last more than an hour. In some embodiments, to perform human subject localization, the LiDAR sensor can be designed as backpacked and hand-held. Because LiDAR-based localization systems are usually not portable, and thereby affecting human motion capture, a lightweight hip-mounted LiDAR sensor is designed to rigidly connect to human body. In this way, human self-localization can be achieved in both large indoor and outdoor scenes. In some embodiments, to make the motion and scene capturing system lighter and be able to communicate wirelessly, a LiDAR-only method for localization and mapping in scenes is disclosed herein. In such embodiments, joint optimization results with the scenes and IMU poses can further improve LiDAR mapping results. Based on the inventions disclosed herein, a metaverse can be created based on optimized human motions and optimized scenes. These and other features of the inventions are described in further detail herein.",
                        "FIG. 1 illustrates various human motions and large scale indoor and outdoor scenes captured using a motion and scene capturing system, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In accordance with various embodiments, a dataset (i.e., HSC4D) 100 containing large scenes ranging from 1 k-5 k m2 with accurate dynamic human motions 102 and locations 104 can be generated using IMU sensors and a LiDAR sensor of the motion and scene capturing system. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the dataset contains diverse scenarios, like a climbing gym 104a, multi-story building 104b, indoor stairs 104c, etc., and challenging human activities, such as exercising 102a, walking up/down stairs 102b, climbing 102c, etc. As can be seen from FIG. 1, accurate human poses and natural interactions between human activities (e.g., 102a-102c) and environments (e.g., 104a-104c) can be effectively captured. Further, effectiveness and generalization ability of the dataset are demonstrated.",
                        "The motion and scene capturing system can be configured to estimate 3D human motions using a LiDAR sensor, such as a 3D spinning LiDAR, and IMU sensors in a large unknown scene and build a map for the large unknown scene, where the estimated 3D human motions can include data relating to local 3D poses and global localization. In general, N frames of the estimated 3D human motion can be represented as M=(T, \u03b8, \u03b2), where T is the N\u00d73 translation parameter, \u03b8 is the N\u00d724\u00d73 pose parameter, and \u03b2 is the N\u00d710 shape parameter. During motion capturing, it can be assumed that \u03b2 is constant. A 3D point cloud scene captured by the LiDAR sensor can be represented as S. A subscript k, k\u2208Z+ is to indicate an index of a point cloud frame. A Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model \u03a6(\u22c5) can be used to map Mk to human mesh models Vk, Vk\u2208R6890\u00d73. In general, data captured using the LiDAR sensor and IMU sensors can have three coordinate systems: a IMU coordinate system, a LiDAR coordinate system, and a global coordinate system. In the IMU coordinate system, {I}, an origin of this coordinate system is set at the hip joint of a SMPL model representing a human, and X/Y/Z axes are pointing to the right/upward/forward directions of the human, respectively. In the LiDAR coordinate system, {L}, an origin of this coordinate system is set at the center of the LiDAR sensor, and X/Y/Z axes are pointing to the right/forward/upward directions of the LiDAR sensor, respectively. In the global coordinate system, {W}, coordinates are set to be the same as coordinates of a first point cloud frame captured by the LiDAR sensor. In general, tasks to be performed by the motion and scene capturing system can be defined as follows: given a sequence of LiDAR sweeps (i.e., point cloud frames) PkL, k\u2208Z+ in {L} (i.e., the LiDAR coordinate system) and a sequence of 3D Human motions MkI in {I} (i.e., the IMU coordinate system), compute a human motion MkW in {W} (i.e., the global coordinate system) and build a 3D scene S with PkI.",

In some embodiments, to ensure the motion and scene capturing system is lightweight and precise, cablings associated with the LiDAR sensor 204 can be modified and routed to the specialized plate 206. In some embodiments, the specialized plate can be a custom designed 10 cm\u00d710 cm L-shape bracket that is utilized to mount the LiDAR sensor 204. In some embodiments, the battery and the computing system 208 can be stored in a small enclosure 210 (e.g., a pouch, a bag, etc.) that can be worn on the human's back. The LiDAR sensor 204 can be worn tightly close to the hip of the human, thereby making the origins of {I} and {L} as close as possible. In this way, point cloud data captured by the LiDAR sensor 204 and human motion data captured by the plurality of IMU sensors 202 can be approximately rigidly transformed to same coordinate system. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2, the LiDAR sensor 204 can have a 360\u00b0 horizon field of view and a 45\u00b0 vertical field of view. However, in such embodiments, due to occlusions caused by back and swing arms of the human, the horizon field of view is reduced from a range of 360\u00b0 to a range between 150\u00b0 to 200\u00b0. Furthermore, in such embodiments, to avoid laser beams emitted from the LiDAR sensor 204 hitting nearby ground, the LiDAR sensor 204 is tilted up 30\u00b0 on the specialized plate 206 to get a good vertical scanning view. In some embodiments, the motion and scene capturing system 200 can be worn by multiple humans to obtain 3D human motion data and point cloud data. For example, a first human can wear the motion and scene capturing system 200 to capture 3D human motion of the first human and to capture an environment surveyed by the first human. In this example, a second person can also wear the motion and scene capturing system 200 and survey the same environment. In this example, data obtained by the first human and data obtained by the second human can be jointly optimized through a data processing pipeline. The data processing pipeline will be discussed in further detail with reference to FIG. 3A herein.",
                        "FIG. 3A illustrates a data processing pipeline 300 to determine pose estimation and LiDAR mapping based on data captured by the motion and scene capturing system 200, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 3, 3D human motion data output by the plurality of IMU sensors 202 and point cloud data outputted by the LiDAR sensor 204 can be obtained by the computing system 208 (e.g., 302 of FIG. 3A). Based on the 3D human motion, ego-motions of the LiDAR sensor 204 can be estimated (e.g., 304 of FIG. 3A). Based on the point cloud data, a 3D scene map S can be built (e.g., 306 of FIG. 3A). A data initialization can be performed to prepare the point cloud data for further optimization (e.g., 308 of FIG. 3A). A graph-based optimization can be performed to fuse LiDAR trajectories determined based on the 3D scene map and IMU trajectories determined based on the 3D human motion (e.g., 310 of FIG. 3A). Finally, by combining the point cloud data, the 3D human motion data, and the 3D scene, a joint optimization can be performed to generate human motions M and an optimized scene (e.g., 312 of FIG. 3A).",

The data processing pipeline 300 can estimate the human motion M in the IMU coordinate {I} as follows: MI=(TI, \u03b8I, \u03b2), where TI and \u03b8I are provided by the plurality of IMU sensors 202. Pose parameter \u03b8I is composed of the hip joint's orientation RI relative to a start point cloud frame and other joints' rotation relative to their parent joints. TkI indicates the k-th frame translation relative to the start point cloud frame. Since the 3D human motion data captured by the plurality of IMU sensors is accurate in a short period, the relative value of TI and RI can be used for optimization.",
                        "In some embodiments, the data processing pipeline 300 can perform LiDAR localization and mapping. In general, building the 3D map using the point cloud data is challenging because of LiDAR jitters caused by human motion, such as walking, and occlusions caused by human body blocking the field of view of the LiDAR sensor 204. As such, by employing LiDAR-based SLAM methods, the ego-motions of the LiDAR sensor 204 can be estimated and the 3D scene map S can be built with the point cloud data PkL, k\u2208Z+ in {L}. Planner and edge feature points in the point cloud data can be extracted for every LiDAR point cloud frame PkL and be used to update a feature map. Frame to frame odometry can be skipped and only frame to map registration is performed because the mapping process can run offline. Finally, the ego-motion TW and RW of the LiDAR sensor 204 and the 3D scene map S are computed. The mapping function can be expressed as:",

To obtain rigid offsets from the point cloud data captured by the LiDAR sensor 204 to the 3D human motion captured by the plurality of IMU sensors 202 and to make coordinate systems of the point cloud data and the 3D motion data aligned, following steps are performed by the data processing pipeline 300: First, the human stands as an A-pose in a starting position in a scene before capture, and the human's face direction is registered as Y-axis direction of the scene. After capturing, point cloud data of the scene is rotated to the Z-axis of the scene perpendicular to ground of the starting position. The scene is then translated so that an origin of the scene matches an origin of a SMPL model corresponding to the human standing on the ground. The ego motion TW and RW of the LiDAR sensor 204 are then translated and rotated in accordance with the scene. The point cloud data is calibrated to {W}. The pitch, roll, and translation of the 3D human motion are calibrated to the global coordinate system.",
                        "In some embodiments, the data processing pipeline 300 can perform time synchronization. In some embodiments, data captured from the LiDAR sensor 204 and the plurality of IMU sensors 202 can be synchronized according to timestamps of peaks in both TW and TI based on their z values. These peaks are generated when, during motion captures, the human jumps from the standing position. In some embodiments, the 3D human motion captured by the plurality of IMU sensors 202 (100 Hz) can be resampled to the same frame rate as the point cloud data captured by the LiDAR sensor 204 (20 Hz).",
                        "In some embodiments, the data processing pipeline 300 can perform graph optimization data fusion. For example, FIG. 3B illustrates a comparison 320 of the IMU trajectory and the LiDAR trajectory, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In general, the IMU trajectory is a movement of a center of the human derived from the 3D human motion data, while the LiDAR trajectory is a movement of the center of human derived from the point cloud data, which is rotated and translated from a center of the LiDAR sensor. As can be seen from FIG. 3B, the 3D human motion data can drift significantly over time and fails when a height of a scene changes, while the point cloud data localizes correctly but jitters at local movements. As such, to estimate a smoother and more stable trajectory, both data's advantages are utilized. The data processing pipeline 300 can estimate the trajectory as follows: 1) first, mark a point cloud frame in TW that exceeds an IMU velocity resulting from multiplying a coefficient to a local fitted value as outliers, 2) treat remaining (RW, TW) as landmarks, then segment TI into multiple sequences according to the landmarks, 3) align TI to TW based on constraints of the landmarks, and 4) perform graph optimization to couple TI and TW.",

For example, FIG. 3C illustrates an example HSC4D dataset 340, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 3C, the example HSC4D dataset 340 can include three large scenes: a rock climbing gym 342, a multi-story building 344, and an outdoor closed-loop road 346. The rock climbing gym 342 has a wall height of 20 meters, with a ground and climbing area size over 1200 m2. The multi-story building includes a scene with an indoor and outdoor area size of up to 5000 m2. This scene has a diversity of heights and environments, including a multi-story structure, slopes, and staircases. The outdoor closed-loop road 346 is 70 m\u00d765 m with slops. In these scenes, captured 3D human activities can include walking, exercising, walking up/down stairs, rock climbing, etc. Since a 3D map generated from a LiDAR is rough and lacks color information, a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) can be used to scan the scenes in color for better visualization.

In this table, cont and sld in four sequences are shown in column two, loss terms ablating comparisons are shown in columns 3-5, an analysis of neighborhood radius r for cropping scenes is shown in columns 6-8. an analysis of an optimization sequence length l is shown in columns 9-10.

                        "As can be seen from these tables, when compared to the HPS dataset, which uses IMU sensors to estimate 3D human poses and a head-mounted camera for localization in large scenes. The HSC4D dataset achieves more accurate localization. In this regard, the HSC4D dataset is generated using IMU sensors with a hip-mounted LiDAR rather than a camera. Further, and more importantly, the HSC4D dataset does not acquire pre-built maps with the assistance of a LiDAR sensor, which allows a capturing system to directly capture scenes without any constraint. As table 362 shows, the HSC4D dataset can extend capturing scenarios to multi-story buildings and vertical routes, which covers more human motions and interactions with environments. As table 366 shows, as a distance increases in a scene, an error increases linearly in all methods. errors of Baseline1 are ten times larger compared to other methods because IMU drifts over time. Baseline2 has a smaller global localization error, but its accumulative errors still vary from 8 cm to 90 cm. The last column shows that the HSC4D dataset achieves the smallest global localization errors in the multi-story building and the road with slopes. More specifically, the HSC4D dataset improves 78.3% accuracy compared to Baseline1 and 25.4% compared to Baseline2. This improvement is illustrated in FIG. 3F. FIG. 3F illustrates a graphical comparison the HSC4D dataset with Baseline1 and Baseline2, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In FIG. 3F, colorful spheres represent IMU and LiDAR trajectories. As can be seen from FIG. 3F, the HSC4D dataset results are natural and accurate in both cases. For example, Baseline1 and Baseline2 are floating in the air in the left figure and Baseline1 is floating in the air and Baseline2's lower leg penetrates the ground in the right figure. As table 368 shows, Baseline1's foot contact loss is much larger than other methods especially in scenes where height change. Baseline2's sld is the largest among all methods. In the first three sequences where Baseline1 is not drift over height, Baseline2's cont is much larger than Baseline1. These cases indicate that LiDAR increases local errors. As can be seen from the last column, the HSC4D dataset significantly decreases cont in all cases and achieve comparable smoothness on sld compared to Baseline1. These comparisons reveal that the HSC4D dataset can achieve smooth results in local pose and is robust in various height diversity scenes.",
