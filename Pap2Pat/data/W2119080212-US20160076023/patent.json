The present invention, also known as \u201cBarcode-directed Assembly for Extra-long Sequences (BAsE-Seq)\u201d provides an approach that can: 1) increase the effective read length of these commercially available sequencing platforms to several kilobases and 2) be broadly applied to obtain long sequence reads from mixed template populations. In brief, our method relies on assigning random DNA barcodes to long template molecules (FIG. 1A), followed by a library preparation protocol that juxtaposes the assigned barcode to random short segments of the original template (FIGS. 1B and 2). The resulting molecules are ligated with platform-specific adaptors for next-generation sequencing. Sequence reads are de-multiplexed using the barcode sequence and used to assemble long-range haplotypes that were present on the original template. In practice, we have applied this technology to perform single virion sequencing on the Hepatitis B virus, a DNA virus with a 3.2 kb genome. In general, we anticipate that this technology can be broadly applied to generate extended sequence reads and will be useful for long-range haplotype analysis on targeted genomic regions, or for improving de novo genome and transcriptome assemblies. A detailed description of our protocol is described in the following paragraphs.",

                        "a) Barcode Assignment.",
                        "In the first step, individual template molecules are assigned with a unique DNA barcode. In our example, two rounds of PCR amplification are performed using primers with template-specific sequence from opposite ends of the molecule (FIG. 1A). This will generate uniquely tagged template molecules for preparing libraries and can be broadly applied for assigning barcodes to targeted genomic regions. Both primers contain a universal sequence on their 5\u2032-ends and one of them contains a barcode, i.e., a string of 20 random nucleotides (encodes for >1012 sequences). To ensure that each template molecule is uniquely assigned, the template should be diluted to obtain a relatively small number of genomes (<109) compared to unique barcode sequences.",
                        "Subsequently, barcode-tagged molecules can be clonally amplified by PCR using universal primers and the PCR product can be used to prepare sequencing libraries. In other manifestations where the template sequence is unknown, the barcode can be assigned by ligation of double- or single-stranded DNA linkers carrying a random string of nucleotides flanked by universal sequences.",
                        "The use of unique barcodes to tag individual template molecules has been shown to greatly reduce the error rate of massively parallel sequencing. Using this strategy, mutations that pre-existed on the template and errors introduced during barcode assignment will be found in all daughter molecules.",
                        "In contrast, errors introduced in subsequent steps of library preparation, sequencing, or base-calling can be easily removed because they will only be present in a minority of daughter molecules (FIG. 1A). Based on the published error rate of the DNA polymerase used in our protocol, this translates to one error in every 50 template sequences for template molecules that are 3 kb in size. Furthermore, by using barcodes as unique identifiers for individual genomes, sequences associated with each barcode can be assembled into a complete template sequence.",
                        "b) Library Preparation.",
                        "The goal of library preparation is to tag overlapping fragments of each template molecule with its assigned barcode in order to obtain uniform sequence coverage. This concept is illustrated in FIG. 1B and a detailed outline of the protocol is shown in FIG. 2.",
                        "Firstly, clonally amplified barcode-tagged molecules are deleted from the barcode-distal end to achieve a broad size distribution of fragments ranging from \u02dc300 bp to N bp, where N equals the length of the template molecule. Unidirectional deletion can be achieved by protecting the barcode-proximal end with nuclease-resistant nucleotides or a 3\u2032-protruding overhang, and performing time-dependent digestion from the barcode-distal end using a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease (such as Exonuclease III), followed by treatment with an endonuclease (such as S1 Nuclease or Mung Bean Nuclease) to generate blunt-ends.",
                        "Barcode-containing fragments are purified using streptavidin-coated beads, and these biotinylated fragments will be dissociated and subjected to end repair, such that both ends of the molecules are blunt and 5\u2032-phosphorylated. The end-repaired molecules are circularized by intramolecular ligation using a DNA ligase (such as T4 DNA ligase). Uncircularized molecules will be removed by nuclease treatment (such as a combination of Exonuclease I and Lambda Exonuclease).",
                        "After circularization, different regions from the original template will be juxtaposed to its barcode. The circularized molecules will be used as template for random fragmentation and adaptor tagging using a transposome-based method, such as the Nextera XT kit (Illumina\u00ae).",
                        "Importantly, the primers used during PCR enrichment of the sequencing library will be designed such that the second sequencing read will be anchored by the barcode sequence. Thus, this PCR generates double-stranded DNA molecules that are \u201csequencing-ready\u201d. Finally, the PCR products are subjected to size selection before sequencing. A custom sequencing primer that anneals to the forward priming sequence is used for the second sequencing read.",
                        "There are several alternative approaches to generate a broad distribution of barcode-tagged molecules before circularization. One approach involves creating a nick at the barcode-distal end using a nicking endonuclease, nick translation towards the barcode-proximal end using DNA polymerase I, followed by treatment with endonuclease to generate a blunt end. Another approach involves performing random fragmentation using a mechanical method, such as using the Covaris instrument for focused-ultrasonication, or an enzymatic method, such as using the NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase, followed by purification of barcode-containing fragments using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads.",
                        "An alternative, PCR-free approach to clonal amplification is contemplated, such as circularizing the barcoded template and performing rolling circle amplification using phi29 polymerase.",
                        "Barcodes can be assigned by linker ligation. Both linkers will contain universal sequences on their 5\u2032-end to facilitate clonal amplification in the next step. The barcode-containing linker will also contain a unique universal sequence on its 3\u2032-end for primer annealing during the PCR step at the end of the protocol.",

The results presented below demonstrate the use of BAsE-Seq to obtain long (\u02dc3.2 kb) sequence reads from individual template molecules, thereby achieving single virion sequencing of HBV.",
                                "HBV DNA was isolated from a chronically infected patient, PCR-amplified to obtain full-length viral genomes, and cloned into a TOPO pCR2.1 vector (Life Technologies\u2122). Sanger sequencing was performed across each clone to obtain full-length sequences, and two clones (Clone-1 and Clone-2) with 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between them were used as input for barcode assignment. In the results presented hereafter, barcode-tagged whole-genome amplicons from 20,000 template molecules (HBV genomes) were used as input for library preparation using the BAsE-Seq protocol described above.",
                                "Summary statistics from a typical single virion sequencing experiment of HBV are shown in Table 1, and coverage data per template molecule are illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. In this library, 18,143,186 read-pairs were obtained from the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina\u00ae), from which Ser. No. 12/004,237 read-pairs contained the barcode in the expected orientation. After trimming for adaptor, barcode tag and universal sequences, and removing reads shorter than 15 bp, 7,336,915 pass-filter read-pairs were used for alignment to a HBV reference genome. From these read-pairs, 97% read-pairs aligned concordantly, and were distributed across 4,294 individual template molecules, 2,717 of which were identified as \u201chigh coverage\u201d and were used for constructing long reads.",
                                "To test the sensitivity and accuracy of our methodology in generating long sequence reads, Clone-1 and Clone-2 were mixed at different ratios to generate a mixed template population where Clone-1 is present at approximately 1% or 10% frequency in the sample. BAsE-Seq was performed on each mixed-template pool. Firstly, barcodes were removed from each read-pair prior to alignment and the resulting data was treated as a \u201cbulk\u201d sequencing experiment to determine overall allele frequencies at the SNP positions. The minor allele frequencies in both libraries were very close to the mixing ratio\u20140.98% for the \u201c1% pool\u201d (Lib\u20141:99) and 13.44% for the \u201c10% pool\u201d (Lib\u20141:9)\u2014indicating that the mixed template pool was generated correctly and PCR bias was negligible (Table 2 and FIG. 7). Subsequently, the \u201cbulk\u201d sequence data was de-multiplexed using barcode sequences and sequence reads from individual template molecules were analyzed to obtain \u02dc3.2 kb reads. Using the long sequence reads, 17-SNP haplotypes were generated for each template molecule. In Lib\u20141:9, 240 molecules carried a Clone-1 haplotype and 1,639 molecules carried a Clone-2 haplotype, corresponding to a 12.77% minor haplotype frequency. In Lib\u20141:99, 20 molecules carried a Clone-1 haplotype and 1,912 molecules carried a Clone-2 haplotype, corresponding to a 1.04% minor haplotype frequency. Importantly, chimeric sequences where Clone-1 and Clone-2 SNPs were found on the same molecule were present at \u22660.1% frequency. Furthermore, the use of barcodes to correct for sequencing errors resulted in a very low error rate for BAsE-Seq, allowing for significant separation of true sequence variants from background noise in Lib\u20141:99 (Table 2 and FIG. 8).",
