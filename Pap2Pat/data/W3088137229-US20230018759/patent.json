                                "Halide perovskites have been explored extensively in the field of optoelectronics. These materials have unusual electronic structures and lattice dynamics. Several classes of halide perovskites, including organic-inorganic hybrid crystals, all-inorganic crystals, and layered crystals, have been identified as promising materials for fabricating solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and radiation detectors. When the crystal size is reduced below the micrometer range, however, the relationship between crystal dimensions and physiochemical properties is not clear. This is, in part, due to the difficulty in preparing site-isolated, high-quality nanocrystals that have defined compositions, sizes, and locations. In addition, the challenge of miniaturizing halide perovskites in a site-specific manner hinders the integration of these materials into micro- and nano-optoelectronic devices. Conventional lithography techniques are largely incompatible with halide perovskites due to the poor chemical stability of these materials in many solvents required for photolithgography."

                        "Halide perovskites generally have the formula ABX3, where A and B are cations and X is one or more halogens. Layered halide perovskites can also be produced. For example RP-(A)2BX4 type structures can be produced. On example of a layered structure is RP-(BA)2PbX4. In accordance with embodiments, arrays of single crystal halide perovskite nanocrystals can be formed on a variety of substrates using arrays of microscopic pen arrays. The arrays can also be formed as defined patterns using subsets of the pens of the microscopic pen arrays,",
                        "In accordance with embodiments, a method of synthesizing halide perovskite arrays can include printing a pattern of nanoreactors from an ink using an array of pens. For example, polymer pen lithography can be used. As is known in the art, polymer pen lithography uses an array of pyramidal pens, each pen being joined to a common surface and having a tip oppositely disposed the common surface. The tip is the portion of the pen that makes contact with the substrate. Various other known tip-based patterning tools can be used as known in the art, including, but not limited to, dip-pen nanolithography, hard-tip, soft-spring lithography, and microcontact printing. As is generally known in the art, the pens of the array have a tip, which can have a radius of curvature of less than 1 \u03bcm. The pens generally have a size on the microscale. The pens can have various shapes. For example, the pens can be pyramidal.",
                        "The ink contains the halide perovskite precursors dissolved in a solvent or solvent system. Reference herein to a solvent should be understood to include a single solvent as well as a solvent system having a combination of solvents. The inks solution includes at least a first perovskite precursor having the formula AX and at least a second perovskite precursor having the formula BX\u20322. In embodiments X and X\u2032 are the same halogen. In other embodiments, X and X\u2032 are different halogens. The ratio of the precursors in the ink is selected to satisfy the stoichiometry of the targeted perovskite. For example, when X and X\u2032 are the same halogen, the ratio of the precursors is typically about 1:1. This ratio is adjusted for mixed-ion perovskites as well as layered perovskites to satisfy the target stoichiometry. For example, for the mixed-ion perovskite MAPb(Br0.4Cl0.6)3, the ratio is MABr:MACl:PbBr2:PbCl2=2:3:2:3.",
                        "The ink can be coated onto a pen array using various known methods, including, but not limited to, spin coating, dip coating, and spray coating. FIG. 2A shows an optical micrograph of a polymer pen array coated with the ink. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 34, unlike conventional polymer inks used in conventional pen array lithography, the liquid organic inks disclosed herein accumulate around the base of each pyramidal tip. In embodiments, the ink has a high surface tension and low viscosity that allows the ink to accumulate around the base and serve as a reservoir for continuous inking. In embodiments, the inks can have a surface tension of about 30 mN/m to about 60 mN/m. FIG. 2B is a three-dimensional confocal microscope image of the polymer pen array loaded with dye-labeled inks, showing the reservoirs of ink that surround the base of the tips. The tips are not visible in the image because they are not dye labeled.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 1, once the tips are inked, the polymer pen array is brought into contact with the surface and retracted, thereby depositing the ink onto the substrate forming a nanoreactor. Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, the nanoreactors evaporate rapidly, which leads to the nucleation and growth of individual halide perovskite nanocrystals. All or substantially all of the nanoreactors results in formation of single crystal halide perovskite nanocrystals.",
                        "The ink can be deposited in a defined pattern, resulting in nanoreactors being formed on the substrate in the defined pattern and ultimately nanocrystals arranged in the defined pattern.",

The ink includes at least a first perovskite precursor of formula AX and at least a second perovskite precursor of formula BX\u20322 as the one or more precursors. The method further includes contacting a substrate with the coated pen array to deposit the first ink as a pattern of printed indicia on the substrate. The printed indicia form nanoreactors on the substrate, and a halide perovskite nanocrystal nucleates and grows within each nanoreactor to form the halide perovskite nanocrystal array.",

                        "In embodiments, the method can further includes repeating the coating step (if more ink is needed). The method can further include a further contacting step to deposit an additional pattern of printed indicia of the first ink on the substrate, but with modification of the extension length or contact time to controllable change the feature size of the resulting nanocrystals that nucleate and grow in the nanoreactors. In embodiments, such modification in subsequent contacting steps can be utilize to print grayscale patterning.",
                        "In embodiments, the method can further include cleaning the pen array and coating the pen array with a second ink. As with the first ink, the second ink includes at least a first perovskite precursor of formula AX and at least a second perovskite precursor of formula BX\u20322. The second ink differs from the first ink by one or more of the concentration of the first and/or the second perovskite precursor, the selection of A, the selection of B, the selection of X or the selection of X\u2032, and the selection of the solvent. The second ink is deposited on the substrate having the first ink deposited thereon by contacting the coated pen array with the substrate to deposit second ink nanoreactors to thereby form halide perovskite nanocrystals that different from those formed from the first ink by one or more of the crystal structure, geometry, size and composition.",
                        "Any suitable number of repeated printing of printed indicia on the substrate with the same or different inks can be used in the methods of the disclosure. The pattern printed by each repeated contacting step can be the same or different. Different patterning can be achieved, for example, by coating different subsets of pens of the pen arrays for subsequent contact steps.",
                        "In embodiments, a pen array can be coated with first and second inks prior to contacting the substrate with the pen array. A first subset of pens can be coated with the first ink and second subset of pens can be coated with the second ink. The coating and selection of subsets can be done to achieve any desired pattern. Upon contacting the substrate with the coated pen array, the first ink is deposited as first printed indicia and the second ink is deposited as second printed indicia simultaneously. As noted above, the first and second inks can different by one or more of precursor concentration, selection of the solvent, or the selection of one or more of the precursors compositions used.",
                        "Further, as know with lithographic techniques such as polymer pen lithography, control of the extension length and/or contact time can be used to control the size of the deposited feature. It has been found that the size of the deposited feature directly correlates to the ultimate size of the nanocrystal formed from the deposited nanoreactor. The larger the deposited feature, the larger the nanocrystal formed. Such control over the deposition can be used to generate gradients of sizes, resulting in an array of halide perovskite nanocrystal having a gradient of crystal sizes. Such control over size can be used to produce combinatorial libraries of halide perovskite nanocrystals with controlled and defined size variations within the library. Changes in extension length and/or contact time can be further or alternatively used to vary the pattern or feature size of a single patterning step or in a multiple-step patterning process.",
                        "The methods of the disclosure can be used to form combinatorial libraries of halide perovskite nanocrystals. Combinatorial libraries of the disclosure can include an array of nanocrystals. The array can have a defined pattern and can have nanocrystals of different size, geometry, crystal structure, and/or composition. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 23J, 25A and 25B, nanocrystals of different compositions can be patterned on a substrate to generate RBG pixel arrays. Any combination of features can be used to generate the combinatorial arrays. The arrays can be used in various applications including for example in optoelectronic devices, such as optical displays, photovoltaic devices, such as solar cells, LEDs, lasers, transistors, batteries, in photocataylsis, piezoelectric energy generators, and in screening methods and sensors.",
                        "In embodiments, the combinatorial library has halide perovskite nanocrystals having a substantially uniform size. In other embodiments, the combinatorial library has halide perovskite nanocrystals having a gradient of sizes. In still further embodiments, the combinatorial library has halide perovskite nanocrystals having various sizes arranged in a defined pattern.",
                        "In embodiments, the combinatorial library has halide perovskite nanocrystals having the same composition. In embodiments, the combinatorial library has two or more different compositions of halide perovskite nanocrystals.",

Larger crystal sizes than 1000 nm can be formed with the methods of the disclosure. However, the methods of the disclosure are particularly useful in forming small crystal sizes, which cannot be readily achieved with prior halide perovskite formation methods.",
                        "In any of the foregoing embodiments, the nanocrystals can have a geometry selected from plates, particles, rods, and core-shell structures. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the geometry of the nanocrystals can be adjusted through control of the solubility of the precursors in the ink, for example, by selection of the solvent or solvent system. For example, in embodiments, by selecting for the inks different solvents having different solubility of the precursors therein, the methods of the disclosure can be used to form a first perovskite nanocrystal, with a second perovskite nanocrystal being formed around the first perovskite nanocrystal like a heterostructure.",
                        "The halide perovskite precursors include at least one first perovskite precursor having the formula AX, and at least one second perovskite precursor having the formula BX2, where is A is a cation and B is a cation, and X is one or more halogens. The ink formulation must include at least one first perovskite precursor and at least one second perovskite precursor. The ink can include any suitable number of first and/or second perovskite precursors.",
                        "In embodiments, the ink includes equimolar amounts of a first perovskite precursor and a second perovskite precursor. In embodiments, the ink includes a 2:1 ratio of the first perovskite precursor and the second perovskite precursor. In embodiments, for example, embodiments for producing a halide perovskite with two halogens, two first perovskite precursors and two second perovskite precursors could be used. For example a ratio of 2:3:2:3 first perovskite precursor of the first type:first perovskite precursor of the second type:second perovskite precursor of the first type:second perovskite precursor of the second type. For example a 2:3:2:3: ratio of MABr, MACl, PbBr2, and PbCl2 can be used in an ink to generate MAPb(Br0.4Cl0.6)3 nanocrystals.",
                        "In embodiments, the ink can be prepared to a target ABX3 concentration. As demonstrated in the examples, the concentration of the ink can be used to control the nanocrystal size.",
                        "Selection of a suitable combination of precursors can be tailored to the ultimately desired halide perovskite. For example, if it the method is for forming a lead halide perovskite, B can be lead, and A can be the desired cation for the perovskite, for example, methylammonium (MA).",
                        "A can be either organic or inorganic. For example, A can be one or more of methylammonium, butylammonium, formamidinium, phenethylamine, 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, cesium, and rubidium.",

A combination of solvents can be used, for example, sulfolane and DMSO. For example, the sulfolane and DMSO can be combined in a solvent ratio of about 7:3. The solvent or combination of solvents is selected such that the halide perovskite precursor can be dissolved in the solvent. In embodiments, the solvent or solvent combination is further selected to have a low vapor pressure. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that using solvents with low vapor pressure can improve the crystal quality.",

The large number of degrees of freedom results in many possible fits that converge with distinct peak shapes, center energies, and relative intensities. Therefore, a deconvolution approach with minimal prior assumptions was used to show the position of each mode. It was assumed that each mode was represented by an arbitrary sharp peak (width<<HRPL peak width) broadened by a Gaussian point spread function (PSF), which together constituted the overall spectrum that contained multiple shoulders. A 512-point Gaussian window was constructed that had an arbitrarily assigned width characterized by the standard deviation, \u03c3GW, and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm was used to deconvolve the spectrum (iterations: 50). The choice of a small \u03c3GW decreases the smallest distance between neighboring detectable modes but also exaggerates noise. The method was consistent in recognizing the major peaks (a, b, c, and d) when \u03c3GW was varied between 30 and 50, in agreement with the second derivative results (FIG. 15A). By fitting the deconvolution results using Gaussian functions, the center energy values for these deconvolved peaks were determined (FIG. 15B).",

The peak positions for all modes was found to be almost the same; however, their relative intensities varied, resulting in the apparent blue shift of the overall emission. Quantitatively, four major models, labeled a, b, c, and din FIG. 13D, were selected for comparison. Referring to FIG. 13E, when all deconvolved spectra were normalized to the range [0, 1], the relative intensity of modes a and b decreased as crystal size decreased, while mode d increased. The peak energies of all four modes exhibited a slight blue shift on the order of a few meV (FIG. 13F), far below the observed overall PL blue shift for the single nanocrystals of different sizes measured in the present example or for the polycrystalline structures reported in literature.

Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that these size-dependent effects are responsible for the slight blue shift of each emission mode. The overall PL shift as a function of crystal size was found to be a result of the systematic intensity modulation of these modes, which has a different physical origin.",

The vacuum exposed deep traps on the surface that are usually blocked by oxygen and water molecules. The emission peak energy was almost unchanged in the presence of absence of the blocker molecules (in air vs. in vacuo), suggesting that the emission modes originated from the interior of the crystals and that surface defects are not involved significantly.",

The HRPL spectra in the <2.32 eV (filter cutoff) region were unchanged from the fully excited spectra, suggesting that the energy states associated with the emission modes have relatively fixed densities and were independent from one another. It was further confirmed that this multi-mode, size-dependent emission behavior was not a result of organic cation rotation or DMSO insertion in the MAPbBr3 crystals by analyzing the behavior or CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and DMF-derived MAPbBr3 polycrystals. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were made in accordance with the protocol outlined in example 1, using CsBr as a halide perovskite precursor and patterning on an HMDS-modified ITO-coated glass substrate.

Multi-peak features were present at all temperatures and can be deconvolved below \u02dc200 K when the signal-to-noise ratio was sufficient.

                                "The emission from single nanocrystals at room temperature in the atmosphere was further studied, excited by cyclically varying excitation power, and a hysteresis loop was observed in the emission intensity (FIGS. 20E and 20F). FIG. 21 illustrates the PL emission of a single about 133 nm MAPbBr3 nanocrystal at 10K in vacuum excited by a 442 nm laser with varying excitation power. Specifically, when the laser power was higher than \u02dc10 \u03bcW, PL intensity from the nanocrystal decreased due to photo-induced damage. The peak energy showed almost no change before the laser power reached the damage threshold when the process was dominated by free exciton-like emission with a power-law slope k=1.14. FIG. 22 is replot of FIG. 20F, showing a log-log scale plot of the PL emission peak intensity as a function of the excitation laser power. The slope of the forward scan before photo-induced damage occurred was k=1.14. There was no evidence of a new bound exciton peak at low excitation power (FIG. 20E). These results are consistent with the interpretation in micron-sized and bulk crystals that various intrinsic defect states exist in proximity to the band edges and that deep traps are protected due to screening. In addition, the damage-induced peak shift was also less than 10 meV (FIG. 20G), much smaller than the size-induced blue shift that spans tens of meV. As the emission modes that constitute the PL peak are independent of each other (FIG. 13H), these results suggest that the hot carrier recombination (band filling) effect or defect density variation were not the main contributors to the size-dependent emission in halide perovskite nanocrystals. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that a redistribution of emission intensity due to the interaction between emitted photons and the crystal, i.e., photon reabsorption and possible photon recycling, are most likely responsible for this size-dependent behavior. The overall PL energy shift of \u02dc26 meV in the nanocrystals (FIG. 13C, crystal size from \u02dc460 to \u02dc110 nm, estimated thickness from \u02dc150 to \u02dc40 nm) was consistent with the depth-dependent cathodoluminescence (CL) energy shift due to reabsorption, as reported in the literature.",
                                "From this data, and without intending to be bound by theory, it can be concluded that two factors primarily cause the size-dependent energy shift of the PL peaks for halide perovskite nanocrystals: (1) defects at the non-continuous electronic band edges resulted in excitonic emissions with varying energies; and (2) the reabsorption of higher-energy photons changed the intensity distribution of these emission modes (FIG. 20H). For larger crystals, photons emitted by higher-energy modes were more efficiently reabsorbed, creating electron-hole pairs that typically relax to lower-energy states non-emissively and causing a decrease in the intensity of higher-energy modes (IHE). In addition, the relative intensity of the lower-energy modes (ILE) in larger crystals might be exaggerated further due to re-emission. The wavelength of the emitted photons (typically 520-550 nm) is larger than the nanocrystal dimensions analyzed herein (typically 100-550 nm). Therefore, the photon energy transfer in nanocrystals is highly localized unlike what occurs in the bulk and microcrystals, which is typically described by a semi-classical light propagation model. This dominant pathway is independent of the surface or strain effects, which cause minimal energy shift (on the order of 100 meV) as a function of crystal size."
