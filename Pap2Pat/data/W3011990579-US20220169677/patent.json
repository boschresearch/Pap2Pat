    "abstract": "A number of anti-angiogenic strategies connected with the VEGF signalling pathway are used in current clinical treatment or trial phase, but they either cause adverse effects or are not specific. Various strategies were aimed at identifying peptides inhibiting the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction. A well-known antiangiogenic peptide is the heptapeptide termed \u201cA7R\u201d having the amino acid sequence ATWLPPR, for which various derivatives have been synthesized, which include peptides having the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg. However, the ability of the known peptides to inhibit the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction was too low for their use as candidate drugs for inhibiting angiogenesis in subjects in need thereof. The present inventors have now conceived a family of novel peptide-like compounds having a nanomolar affinity for NRP-1, which are thus endowed with a powerful capacity to inhibit the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction. These novel peptide-like compounds may be relevantly used as antiangiogenic compounds, especially in subjects affected with cancer.",

                        "Neuropilin-1 (also termed \u201cNRP-1\u201d) is overexpressed in various kinds of malignant tumors. The interaction of NRP-1 with the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (also termed \u201cVEGF-A165\u201d) leads to the progression of tumor vascularization and growth. NRP-1 is a co-receptor for tyrosine kinase receptor VEGF-R1/VEGF-R2/VEGF-R3 and their signalling are critical for lymphoangiogenesis, angiogenesis and tumor growth.",
                        "A number of anti-angiogenic strategies connected with the VEGF signalling pathway are used in current clinical treatment or trial phase, but they either cause adverse effects or are not specific (Papadopoulos et al., 2012, Angiogenesis, Vol. 15: 171-185).",
                        "With the view of treating diseases involving an interaction between NRP-1 and VEGF-A165, compounds have been identified in the art that alter or block this interaction.",
                        "Notably, a class of peptides that share a R/K/XXR/K motif with the C-terminal domain of VEGF-A165 and bind to NRP-1 have been selected through a phage display screening method (Teesalu et al., 2009, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, Vol. 106 (39): 16157-16162).",
                        "A well-known peptide that blocks the interaction of NRP-1 with VEGF-A165 is the heptapeptide termed \u201cA7R\u201d having the amino acid sequence ATWLPPR (SEQ ID NO. 1) (Binetruy-Tournaire et al., 2000, EMBO J, Vol. 19: 1525-1533). Basing on the shortest active sequence (LPPR) of A7R (Starzec et al., 2007, Peptides, Vol. 28: 2397-2402), a new family of peptides were developed which exhibit a significant VEGF-A165/NRP-1 binding inhibitory effect (Fedorczyk et al., 2017, J Pept Sci, Vol. 23: 445-454; Tymecka et al., 2018, Eur J Med Chem, Vol. 158: 453-462). The most active of these peptides have the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg (SEQ ID NO. 2), where AA2 or AA3 are Proline residues (Tymecka et al., 2018, Eur J Med Chem, Vol. 158: 453-462). These authors have shown that some of the peptides having the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg allow a more effective inhibition, the most active compounds being over 23-fold more potent than the parent peptide KPPR and the heptapeptide A7R which was proved to have antiangiogenic activity in vivo.",
                        "Other peptides of the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg were further conceived and tested for their VEGF-A165/NRP-1 binding inhibitory effect (Puszko et al., 2019, MedChemComm, Vol. 10: 332-340). These authors have synthesized a plurality of series of peptides comprising multiple variations in AA2 and AA3, respectively, by replacing the initial proline residues by unnatural proline analogues with different rigidity and ring size, such as those termed Hyp, Aze, \u0394Pro, Oic, Piz and Tic, respectively. The results showed that optimization of the central part of the parent sequence (i.e. AA2 and AA3 residues) led to compounds, which show a 2- and 4-fold decrease in the IC50. According to these authors, replacing the initial proline residue located as AA3 by \u0394Pro or Oic seemed to increase interaction with NRP-1. These authors believed that this increased binding to NRP-1 might probably due to the more rigid rings in \u0394Pro and Oic, which might promote the optimal peptide-like chain position on the receptor surface.",
                        "There remains a need for further compounds altering or blocking the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction so as to generate an antiangiogenic and/or anti-tumoral activities that is useful in the treatment of diseases such as cancers."

The functional groups of the side-chains of the building blocks should be protected with orthogonal protecting groups (P) that are eliminated under acidic or basic conditions. The preferred N-\u03b1-protecting groups are: 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc) or tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc) for N-terminal amino acid for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I-A2). Other protecting groups preferred for the protection of functional groups in the side chain building blocks are: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl group (Pbf), Boc, Fmoc, allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc), tripheylmethyl group (Trt). For the synthesis of peptidomimetics, C-terminal amino acid may be already attached to a polymeric support which is chemically inert and insoluble in the reaction media used. Wang resin is a preferred resin for the peptide synthesis in the Fmoc strategy. Peptide bonds can be obtained by using the standard coupling reagents: 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU) in the presence of a base used for deprotonation of carboxylic acid, preferably N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA).",
                                "The final step of the synthesis, is the cleavage of the peptide from the resin and it is preferred to use a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)/water/triisopropylsilane (TIS) (88:5:5:2 v/w/v/v). The crude products may be purified using high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse phase column packed with a C-12 gradient of 0%-20% (B) over 30 minutes, where phase (A) is 0.1% TFA in H2O and the phase (B) is 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (ACN).

After the washing, for monitoring of the completion of the Fmoc cleavage, the colorimetric assay was made. Usually, for primary amines, this is the Kaiser test.

For monitoring of the completion of the Fmoc cleavage from homoarginine residue the Kaiser test was performed. As usual, the deep blue colour of resin and solution indicated that deprotection of amino group was completed which allowed to proceed to the next step.",

After 1 minute of stirring, the mixture was added to the resin and mixed for two hours. After this time, the resin was filtered off and washed four times (1 minute) with a fresh portion (6 ml) of DMF, and then again the Kaiser test was performed. The result of Kaiser test was negative, which means the completion of the coupling reaction. Next, Fmoc-deprotection and washing after Fmoc-deprotection steps were done.",
                                "The next step of all synthesis was the washing of the peptidyl-resin with 5 mL of DCM, 5 ml of methanol (MeOH) and 5 ml of diethyl ether (Et2O), three times for one minute each and subsequently the peptidyl-resin was dried under vacuum. Complete acidolytic cleavage and deprotection was occurred after 3 hours of stirring the resin in a mixture of TFA/DTT/H2O/TIS in a ratio of 88:5:5:2 (v/w/v/v). Next the resin was filtered off and crude peptide was precipitated by adding the cleavage mixture dropwise into a large excess of the cold diethyl ether. Crude peptides were collected by centrifugation. Finally, the crude peptide was purified by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the C-12 reverse phase column. Elution was done by linear gradient 0%-20% (B) in 30 minutes where buffer (A) was 0.1% TFA in water and buffer (B) was 0.1% TFA in ACN. Pure peptide was collected, lyophilized and analysed by LC-MS. Molecular weight and elemental composition was confirmed using HRMS. All desired compounds were isolated as the trifluoroacetate salts.",
