# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to the field of VEGF inhibitors for medical use and more precisely to the field of peptide inhibitors of the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction.

## BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

Neuropilin-1 (also termed “NRP-1”) is overexpressed in various kinds of malignant tumors. The interaction of NRP-1 with the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (also termed “VEGF-A165”) leads to the progression of tumor vascularization and growth. NRP-1 is a co-receptor for tyrosine kinase receptor VEGF-R1/VEGF-R2/VEGF-R3 and their signalling are critical for lymphoangiogenesis, angiogenesis and tumor growth.

A number of anti-angiogenic strategies connected with the VEGF signalling pathway are used in current clinical treatment or trial phase, but they either cause adverse effects or are not specific (Papadopoulos et al., 2012, Angiogenesis, Vol. 15: 171-185).

With the view of treating diseases involving an interaction between NRP-1 and VEGF-A165, compounds have been identified in the art that alter or block this interaction.

Notably, a class of peptides that share a R/K/XXR/K motif with the C-terminal domain of VEGF-A165 and bind to NRP-1 have been selected through a phage display screening method (Teesalu et al., 2009, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, Vol. 106 (39): 16157-16162).

A well-known peptide that blocks the interaction of NRP-1 with VEGF-A165 is the heptapeptide termed “A7R” having the amino acid sequence ATWLPPR (SEQ ID NO. 1) (Binetruy-Tournaire et al., 2000, EMBO J, Vol. 19: 1525-1533). Basing on the shortest active sequence (LPPR) of A7R (Starzec et al., 2007, Peptides, Vol. 28: 2397-2402), a new family of peptides were developed which exhibit a significant VEGF-A165/NRP-1 binding inhibitory effect (Fedorczyk et al., 2017, J Pept Sci, Vol. 23: 445-454; Tymecka et al., 2018, Eur J Med Chem, Vol. 158: 453-462). The most active of these peptides have the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg (SEQ ID NO. 2), where AA2 or AA3 are Proline residues (Tymecka et al., 2018, Eur J Med Chem, Vol. 158: 453-462). These authors have shown that some of the peptides having the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg allow a more effective inhibition, the most active compounds being over 23-fold more potent than the parent peptide KPPR and the heptapeptide A7R which was proved to have antiangiogenic activity in vivo.

Other peptides of the general sequence Lys(hArg)-AA2-AA3-Arg were further conceived and tested for their VEGF-A165/NRP-1 binding inhibitory effect (Puszko et al., 2019, MedChemComm, Vol. 10: 332-340). These authors have synthesized a plurality of series of peptides comprising multiple variations in AA2 and AA3, respectively, by replacing the initial proline residues by unnatural proline analogues with different rigidity and ring size, such as those termed Hyp, Aze, ΔPro, Oic, Piz and Tic, respectively. The results showed that optimization of the central part of the parent sequence (i.e. AA2 and AA3 residues) led to compounds, which show a 2- and 4-fold decrease in the IC50. According to these authors, replacing the initial proline residue located as AA3 by ΔPro or Oic seemed to increase interaction with NRP-1. These authors believed that this increased binding to NRP-1 might probably due to the more rigid rings in ΔPro and Oic, which might promote the optimal peptide-like chain position on the receptor surface.

There remains a need for further compounds altering or blocking the VEGF-A165/NRP-1 interaction so as to generate an antiangiogenic and/or anti-tumoral activities that is useful in the treatment of diseases such as cancers.

    protecting group),  
    and any pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or racemic,
    enantiomeric, diastereoisomeric or tautomeric forms thereof.

The terms “protecting group” and “protecting groups” as used herein refer to any atom or group of atoms that is added to a molecule in order to prevent existing groups in the molecule from undergoing unwanted chemical reactions. A “protecting group” may be a labile chemical moiety that is known in the art to protect reactive groups, such as hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups, against undesired or untimely reactions during chemical synthesis. Protecting groups are typically used selectively and/or orthogonally to protect sites during reactions at other reactive sites and can then be removed to leave the unprotected group as is or available for further reactions.

Examples of protecting group moieties are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3. Ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1999, and in J. F. W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press, 1973, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference for the limited purpose of disclosing suitable protecting groups. The protecting group moiety may be chosen in such a way, that they are stable to certain reaction conditions and readily removed at a convenient stage using methodology known from the art.

Amine protecting groups (which may also be termed amino protecting groups) encompass Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl), Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl), Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl), Ac (acetyl), Alloc (allyloxycarbonyl), Ts (p-toluenesulfonyl) groups. Protecting groups proposed for functional groups in the side chains of the residues (also termed “side chains protecting groups” herein) encompass e.g. 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl group (Pbf) and Boc for guanidine; tripheylmethyl group (Trt), p-methylbenzyl (Meb), acetamidomethyl (Acm) for thiol group.

As used herein, a compound of formula (I) encompasses a compound of formula (I′). Thus, an embodiment relating to compound (I) as described herein encompasses the same embodiment of the corresponding compound of formula (I′).

As used herein, group A1 of a compound of formula (I) encompasses group A1′. Thus, an embodiment relating to group A1 of a compound (I) as described herein encompasses the corresponding embodiment of group A1′.

As used herein, group A2 of a compound of formula (I) encompasses group A2′. Thus, an embodiment relating to group A2 of a compound (I) as described herein encompasses the corresponding embodiment of group A2′.

As it is shown in the examples, the compounds of formula (I) as described herein possess high binding properties to NRP-1, and thus a high level ability to inhibit or block the interaction between NRP-1 and VEGF-A165.

More precisely, the inventors have shown that the compounds of formula (I) disclosed herein bind to NRP-1 at the nanomolar level whereas the most efficient known inhibitors to date bind to NRP-1 at the micromolar level. As shown in the examples, the compounds of formula (I) bind to NRP-1 with an IC50 value of equal or less than 100 nM, as determined by a chemiluminescence binding assay wherein the inhibition of the biding of VEGF-A165 to immobilized NRP-1 by compounds of formula (I) was measured.

As used herein, the term “VEGF-A165” (which is also termed “VEGFA165”) is a human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor isoform, which consists of a disulfide-linked homodimer containing two polypeptides chains of 165 amino acids each.

In most preferred embodiments, VEGF-A165 is a homodimer polypeptide containing two identical polypeptide chains and having the NCBI reference number NP 001165097.

As used herein, “NRP-1” means Neuropilin-1, which is a protein belonging the Neuropilins family of cell surface receptors, which are engaged in multiple important cellular signalling cascades. NRP-1 is a co-receptor for tyrosine kinases (VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3) and its signalling is critical for VEGF-A165/VEGF-R2 and VEGF-A165/VEGF-R1-mediated angiogenesis, tumor growth and fundamental in the transition of tumours from a benign state to a malignant.

In most preferred embodiments, NRP-1 is the human polypeptide having 923 amino acids in length consisting of the sequence having the GenBank reference number AAC51759.1.

As it is apparent throughout the present disclosure, the compounds of formula (I), which includes compounds (I′) as it is previously mentioned, all possess at least one common feature consisting of a sulfhydryl group which is borne by the cysteine residue located at the N-terminal side thereof.

Each compound of formula (I) comprises a cysteine residue located at the N-terminal side thereof. As it is shown in the examples herein, the cysteine residue comprised in a compound of formula (I) shall not be compulsory the N-terminal amino acid thereof.

In some embodiments of a compound of formula (I), the cysteine residue is bound to the peptide backbone through the alpha amino group of homoarginine in lysine(homoarginine) moiety thereof.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors believe that the presence of the cysteine residue in a compound of formula (I), which includes the presence of the sulfhydryl group thereof at the N-terminal side of a compound of formula (I), imparts the high binding level of a compound of formula (I) to NRP-1, and especially to human NRP-1.

Illustratively, in embodiments of a compound of formula (I) (and of formula (I′)) wherein Group A is A1 (or A1′), a cysteine residue is the N-terminal amino acid thereof and is linked to the alpha amino group of an amino acid selected in the group consisting of lysine, leucine, threonine and lysine in lysine(homoarginine) moiety.

Still illustratively, in embodiments of a compound of formula (I) (and of formula (I′)) wherein group A is A2 (or A2′), a cysteine residue is located at the N-terminal side thereof, and is linked to the alpha amino group of a homoarginine residue in N-terminal lysine(homoarginine) moiety.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors believe that important moieties of a compound of formula (I) that impart a high level of binding to NRP-1, and thus a high level of anti-angiogenic activity, are (i) the presence of a cysteine residue at the N-terminal side and (ii) the presence of an arginine residue as the C-terminal amino acid.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors believe that the presence of proline analogues instead of proline residues in a compound of formula (I) also contribute to optimization of the high capacity of a compound of formula (I) to bind to NRP-1. The replacement of proline residues by proline analogues has been already shown in the art to improve affinity of peptide-like ligands to NRP-1 (Puszko et al., 2019, MedChemComm, Vol. 10(2): 332-340).

A used herein, “proline analogues” consist of proline mimetics compounds differing from the proline residue by their rigidness as well as by their ring size. Most preferred embodiments of proline analogs in the present disclosure are selected in the group consisting of ΔPro, and Oic.

## EXAMPLES

### Example

**Example 1: Synthesis of the Peptide VEGF-A165/NRP-1 Inhibitors**

Example 1 describes the general procedure for the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I).

Peptidomimetics of the present invention may be obtained by using the well-known procedures of the Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). The functional groups of the side-chains of the building blocks should be protected with orthogonal protecting groups (P) that are eliminated under acidic or basic conditions. The preferred N-α-protecting groups are: 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc) or tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc) for N-terminal amino acid for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I-A2). Other protecting groups preferred for the protection of functional groups in the side chain building blocks are: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl group (Pbf), Boc, Fmoc, allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc), tripheylmethyl group (Trt). For the synthesis of peptidomimetics, C-terminal amino acid may be already attached to a polymeric support which is chemically inert and insoluble in the reaction media used. Wang resin is a preferred resin for the peptide synthesis in the Fmoc strategy. Peptide bonds can be obtained by using the standard coupling reagents: 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU) in the presence of a base used for deprotonation of carboxylic acid, preferably N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA).

The final step of the synthesis, is the cleavage of the peptide from the resin and it is preferred to use a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT)/water/triisopropylsilane (TIS) (88:5:5:2 v/w/v/v). The crude products may be purified using high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse phase column packed with a C-12 gradient of 0%-20% (B) over 30 minutes, where phase (A) is 0.1% TFA in H2O and the phase (B) is 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (ACN). The products obtained can optionally be converted to a desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt using a conventional method.

**B. Solid Phase Synthesis of Peptides of Formula (I)**

The procedure for the synthesis of this group of compounds of the present invention is discussed below.

**Example 2: Solid Phase Synthesis of the Compound of Formula (I) H-Cys-Lys(hArg)-Dab-ΔPro-Arg-OH, Wherein Group a is Group A1**

In compound formulas illustrated in example 2, each of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5, when present, have the same meanings as for the general definition of the compound of formula (I) specified in the present disclosure.

500 mg of pre-loaded Fmoc-L-Arg(Pbf) Wang resin with capacity 0.39 mmol/g was mixed in 6 ml of the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for four hours.

After that time, Fmoc-deprotection step was done: the resin was filtered off and then mixed in 6 ml of 20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF for 5 minutes, then the resin was filtered off and a fresh aliquot of 20% piperidine in DMF was added (6 ml) and stirred for another 20 minutes. Next, washing after Fmoc-deprotection step was done: the resin was washed alternately with 6 mL of DMF and 6 ml of isopropanol (IPA) three times for one minute each, followed by washing of the resin three times (for one minute) with a fresh portion of DMF. After the washing, for monitoring of the completion of the Fmoc cleavage, the colorimetric assay was made. Usually, for primary amines, this is the Kaiser test. For this purpose a few resin beads were placed in small test tube and few drops (equal volumes) of the three solutions [(A): 5 g of ninhydrin in 100 ml ethanol; (B): 80 g phenol in 20 ml of ethanol; (C) 2 ml 0.001 M aqueous KCN in 98 ml pyridine] were added. The test tube was placed in thermo block and heated for 5 minutes at 100° C. A positive Kaiser test result (deep blue colour of resin and solution) was obtained which allowed us to proceed to the next step wherein 2 eq of Fmoc-ΔPro-OH (134 mg; 0.4 mmol), 2 eq of HATU (152 mg; 0.2 mmol) and 5 eq of DIPEA (169 μL; 1 mmol) were dissolved in 5 ml of DMF—to form the preactivation mixture. The preactivation mixture was stirred for 1 minute and added to the resin and mixed for two hours. After this time the resin was filtered off and washed four times (1 minute) with DMF (6 ml) and then the colorimetric assay was made. For secondary amines, this is the acetaldehyde/chloranil test. For this purpose a few resin beads were placed in small test tube and few drops (equal volumes) of the two solutions [(A): 2% of chloranil in DMF; (B): 2% of acetaldehyde in DMF] were added. After a short mixing the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 minutes. A negative test result (which means the completion of the coupling reaction) was obtained which allowed us to proceed to the next step. Next, Fmoc-deprotection and washing after Fmoc-deprotection steps were done. After the wash sequence, for monitoring of the completion of the Fmoc cleavage, the acetaldehyde/chloranil test was made. The positive result of test was obtained (the dark blue colour of beads of resin indicated the completion of the Fmoc cleavage) which allowed to proceed to the coupling step.

After 1 minute the preactivation mixture was added to the resin and mixed for two hours. After this time, the resin was filtered off and washed four times (1 minute) with a fresh portion (6 ml) of DMF, and then the Kaiser test was performed. The result of Kaiser test was negative, which means the completion of the coupling reaction. Next, Fmoc-deprotection and washing after Fmoc-deprotection steps were done.

The next step of all synthesis was the washing of the peptidyl-resin with 5 mL of DCM, 5 ml of methanol (MeOH) and 5 ml of diethyl ether (Et2O), three times for one minute each and subsequently the peptidyl-resin was dried under vacuum. Complete acidolytic cleavage and deprotection was occurred after 3 hours of stirring the resin in a mixture of TFA/DTT/H2O/TIS in a ratio of 88:5:5:2 (v/w/v/v). Next the resin was filtered off and crude peptide was precipitated by adding the cleavage mixture dropwise into a large excess of the cold diethyl ether. Crude peptides were collected by centrifugation. Finally, the crude peptide was purified by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the C-12 reverse phase column. Elution was done by linear gradient 0%-20% (B) in 30 minutes where buffer (A) was 0.1% TFA in water and buffer (B) was 0.1% TFA in ACN. Pure peptide was collected, lyophilized and analysed by LC-MS. Molecular weight and elemental composition was confirmed using HRMS. All desired compounds were isolated as the trifluoroacetate salts.

**Example 4: Binding of Compounds of Formula (I) to NRP-1**

**NRP-1 Binding Assay**

The flat bottom surface of a 96-well plate was coated with 100 μL (200 ng/well) recombinant human NRP-1 and incubated overnight at 4° C. Non-specific binding was blocked by the incubation with 0.5% BSA in PBS. 50 μL of peptide dissolved in PBS in range concentrations and 50 μL (400 ng/mL) of human (bt)-VEGF-A165 in PBS containing 4 μg/mL of heparin were added respectively. After 2 h incubation at room temperature the plate was washed and treated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in PBS (1:8000). Chemiluminescence was quantified immediately after addition of 100 μL Chemiluminescent substrate. In a positive control only (bt)-VEGF-A165 was present in wells, while, in negative control, wells were not coated by NRP-1. Percentages of inhibition were calculated by the following formula:

100%−[[(S−SN)/(P−NS)]·100%]

where S is the signal intensity measured, NS is the signal measured in negative control, and P is the signal measured in positive control.

**B. Results**

Active tetrapeptides described in the literature: LPPR (active part of A7R), TKPR (tuftsin) and KPRR (peptide derived from the VEGF-A165) was modified by addition of N-terminal Cys. Obtained compounds showed significantly better affinity compared to parent sequence:

Branched peptides (Lys(hArg)-X-X-Arg) without cysteine had IC50 between 1-0.2 μM but the half maximal inhibitory concentration was obtained using less sensitive colorimetric method (Tymecka D. et al. Branched pentapeptides as potent inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 binding to Neuropilin-1: Design, synthesis and biological activity. Eur J Med Chem, 2018, Vol. 158: 453-462). Examples are showed below:

Selected active branched peptides were tested again using a more sensitive method with chemiluminescent detection. Moreover, some modified compounds were also examined. The IC50 for selected Lys(hArg)-X-X-Arg peptides was between 2-21 μM (Puszko A. K. at al. Neuropilin-1 peptide-like ligands with proline mimetics, tested using the improved chemiluminescence affinity detection method. MedChemComm, 2019, Vol. 10: 332-340). Some examples are showed below:
