The isolated peptides are proven to be useful and effective in the nuclear delivery of a selected target substance, such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, pharmaceutically active agents, chemical substances, etc. The isolated peptide can transport a target substance, in particular a protein, into the nucleus of a mammalian cell by forming a conjugate with the target substance, or via an expression cassette capable of expressing a fusion protein having the isolated peptide and the target protein.",

                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "This invention primarily relates to nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides derived from the VP2 protein of chicken anemia virus (CAV). Said NLS peptides are useful and effective in the nuclear delivery of a selected target substance, such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, pharmaceutically active agents, chemical substances, etc., and therefore are expected to have potential for use in the fields of pharmacy, medicine, biotechnology, genetic engineering, etc.",
                        "2. Description of the Related Art",
                        "Nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is a process in eukaryotic cells that transports macromolecules, such as nuclear protein and RNA, etc., between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), plays an important role in developmental processes, signal transductions and gene expression regulations. In general, ions and small proteins (namely those having a molecular weight in the range of about 40 to 60 kDa) can pass through the NPCs and enter the cell nucleus via passive diffusion. However, for large proteins to pass through the NPCs and enter the cell nucleus, nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mediated active transport is necessarily required.",
                        "Typically, most of the NLSs are short peptides that contain one or two clusters of basic amino acid residues. NLSs can be recognized by a member in the family of importins (which act as a carrier and include, e.g., importin \u03b1 and importin \u03b2) to thereby trigger the binding of the importin with a substrate protein, leading said substrate protein to be imported into the cell nucleus by passing through the NPCs.",
                        "Currently, NLSs may be divided into three groups as follows:\n\n\n- (i) monopartite NLSs, which are primarily constituted of one cluster\n  of basic amino acid residues, such as lysine and arginine, and a\n  representative of which is the SV40 large T-antigen NLS (PKKKRKV; SEQ\n  ID NO: 1);\n- (ii) bipartite NLSs, which are primarily constituted of two clusters\n  of basic amino acid residues separated by a spacer of about 10\u02dc12\n  amino acid residues, and a representative of which is the\n  nucleoplasmin NLS (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK; SEQ ID NO: 2); and\n- (iii) noncanonical NLSs, which are primarily constituted of polar or\n  nonpolar amino acid residues, and representatives of which include,\n  e.g., the M9 domain of the hnRNP A1 protein, the NLS in the influenza\n  virus nucleoprotein, the NLS in the yeast transcription repressor\n  Mat\u03b12, and the NLS in the yeast Ga14 protein.",
                        "It is previously reported that positively-charged NLS peptides can be coupled to negatively-charged DNA molecules via electrostatic interactions to thereby enhance the nuclear transport of said DNA molecules. Alternatively, the NLS peptides can be covalently coupled to either a condensing agent (such as a cationic polymer) of a gene delivery system or the phosphate backbone of a DNA molecule (Marieke A. E. M. van der Aa et al. (2006), Pharmaceutical Research, 23:447-459). In addition, the NLS peptides can be linked to an antitumor drug (such as a photosensitizer or a radionuclide) to deliver said antitumor drug into the cell nucleus for therapy (T. V. Akhlynina et al. (1997), J. Biol. Chem., 272:20328-20331; A. S. Sobolev (2009), Biochemistry (Moscow), 74:1567-1574).",
                        "In view of their advantageous bioactivities as described above, NLS peptides have been widely used in gene transfection (such as the expression regulation of endogenous or exogenous nucleic acids as well as epigenetic regulation), gene therapy and drug delivery.",
                        "However, whether or not a NLS peptide would have a potential in any of the applications as described above will depend on its nuclear transport efficiency. Moreover, in order to efficiently deliver a desired substance (such as a target gene, protein, drug and the like) into the cell nucleus of a target cell and exert activity/function there, in addition to optimizing an NLS peptide in terms of nuclear transport efficiency, it is necessary to consider the bioproperties of a nuclear transport system used to deliver said substance, including cellular uptake (such as endocytosis), intracellular trafficking, etc. Accordingly, researchers in the relevant art are endeavoring to explore new NLS peptides that exhibit nuclear localization ability in mammalian cells.",
                        "Chicken anemia virus (CAV), also called \u201cchicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV)\u201d, is a small non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus that causes a severe immunosuppressive syndrome and anemia in infected chickens. Up to the present, a large number of CAV isolates, including strains from Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Germany, Malaysia, Nigeria, Slovenia, Taiwan and USA, have been reported and have had full or partial sequences published (Schat K A (2009), Curr Top Microbiol Immunol., 331:151-183; and Y. S. Lu et al. (1993), Exp. Rep. TPRIAH, 29:81-89).",
                        "The DNA genome of CAV is about 2.3 kb in size and there are three open reading frames (ORFs) present on the negative sense genome. At least three viral proteins are produced from a single polycistronic 2.1 kb mRNA that is produced as a single molecule and contains a promoter, TATA-box, and poly (A) signal. The three translated proteins are called VP1, VP2 and VP3, respectively, in which VP1 is a 51 kDa protein that is the structure protein involved in assembly of the viral caspid; VP2 is a 24 kDa protein that contains a dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) activity and is required for virus infection, assembly and replication; and VP3, also called apoptin, is a 13 kDa protein that induces apoptosis in infected chicken cells.",
                        "It has been reported that the CAV VP3 protein contains two NLSs, one (i.e., NLS1) being located at positions spanning amino acid residues 82 to 88, and the other (i.e., NLS2) being located at positions spanning amino acid residues 111 to 121, in which these two NLSs together act as a bipartite NLS and constitute a tumor cell-specific nuclear targeting signal that enables the VP3 protein to specifically induce apoptosis in tumor and transformed cells but not in normal or untransformed cells (Astrid A. A. M. Danen-van Oorschot et al. (2003), J. Biol. Chem., 278: 27729-27736; Ivan K. H. Poon et al. (2005), Cancer Res., 65:7059-7064).",
                        "C. Lacorte et al. assessed the expression of three green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused CAV proteins, namely GFP:VP1, GFP:VP2 and GFP:VP3, in plant cells. VP1, VP2 and VP3 fused to GFP all showed nuclear localization, indicating that nuclear localization signals of these three CAV proteins were functional in plants. However, this nuclear localization is not always observed, since VP3 does not localize in the nucleus of normal human cells (C. Lacorte et al. (2007), Virus Research, 129:80-86).",
                        "However, in view of the short length and sequence divergence of NLS peptides, it is difficult to predict the location of functional NLS peptide(s) in a specific protein simply by analyzing the amino acid sequence of said protein.",
                        "Insofar as the applicants know, the specific mechanism for the nuclear localization of the CAV VP2 protein has yet to be understood. In this invention, the applicants endeavored to explore NLS peptide(s) from the CAV VP2 protein that is/are functional in mammalian cells. The applicants therefore used an in silico method to analyze the VP2 proteins of various isolated strains of CAV and to predict the possible NLS peptide(s) contained therein, followed by conducting deletion analysis and point mutation analysis. The obtained results reveal that the CAV VP2 protein contains a functional NLS peptide, which is located at a region spanning amino acid residues 133-138 of the full-length amino acid sequence of the CAV VP2 protein, and which has been proved to exhibit nuclear localization ability for the nuclear delivery of functional molecules in mammalian cells."

For example, a polypeptide that is derived from a second polypeptide can include an amino acid sequence that is identical or substantially similar to the amino acid sequence of the second polypeptide. In the case of polypeptides, the derived species can be obtained by, for example, naturally occurring mutagenesis, artificial directed mutagenesis or artificial random mutagenesis. The mutagenesis used to derive polypeptides can be intentionally directed or intentionally random, or a mixture of each. The mutagenesis of a polypeptide to create a different polypeptide derived from the first can be a random event (e.g., caused by polymerase infidelity) and the identification of the derived polypeptide can be made by appropriate screening methods, e.g., as discussed herein. Mutagenesis of a polypeptide typically entails manipulation of the polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide.

An isolated nucleic acid is present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and RNA) are found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes; and RNA sequences (e.g., a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein) are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. Hence, with respect to an \u201cisolated nucleic acid molecule,\u201d which includes a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, the \u201cisolated nucleic acid molecule\u201d (1) is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the \u201cisolated nucleic acid molecule\u201d is found in nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.
