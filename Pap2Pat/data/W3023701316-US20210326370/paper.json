    "title": "Interpretable Methods for Identifying Product Variants",
    "date": "2020-04-20",
    "abstract": "For e-commerce companies with large product selections, the organization and grouping of products in meaningful ways is important for creating great customer shopping experiences and cultivating an authoritative brand image. One important way of grouping products is to identify a family of product variants, where the variants are mostly the same with slight and yet distinct differences (e.g. color or pack size). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying product variants. It combines both constrained clustering and tailored NLP techniques (e.g. extraction of product family name from unstructured product title and identification of products with similar model numbers) to achieve superior performance compared with an existing baseline using a vanilla classification approach. In addition, we design the algorithm to meet certain business criteria, including meeting high accuracy requirements on a wide range of categories (e.g. appliances, decor, tools, and building materials, etc.) as well as prioritizing the interpretability of the model to make it accessible and understandable to all business partners.",

                "The organization and grouping of products is important for ecommerce and retail companies to streamline the shopping experience and showcase product authority. Identifying product variants is one of the important tasks within the domain of product grouping and recommendation. Product variants are groups of products that share many similarities except for a few differences. For example, the same faucet may be sold in a number of different finishes, as shown in Figure 1. Product variants are particularly useful to customers for a number of reasons.",
                "\u2022 They help users find alternative products easily and without the hassle of searching or browsing through the massive product catalog. \u2022 They save consumers time in comparing alternative products by ensuring that key product features remain the same across product variants. \u2022 They simplify search results and product lists by grouping similar products together.",
                "On e-commerce websites, product variant information is often prominently displayed on product detail and product listing pages, and receives extraordinarily high user views, clicks, and purchases. Figure 2 shows how product variant options may be shown to the user.",
                "Due to the importance of product variant identification, the execution requirements for the algorithm are very high. In addition to high performance, the algorithm must have a high degree of interpretability and transparency to receive support from business stakeholders and enable collaboration with various domain experts. 1.1 Algorithm Requirements 1.1.1 Precision. Product variant information is highly visible to end customers, and mistakes can significantly impact customer experience and site performance. As a result, there is a very high requirement for the precision of product variant identification.",
                "1.1.2 Recall. High recall is also highly desired. Showing the complete product offerings not only helps customers find the right products quicker, but also projects the right image of product authority and increases customer loyalty.",
                "1.1.3 Leverage Domain Knowledge. When working with a wide variety of product categories, it is important to define product variants in different ways. For example, while faucets may vary by color, it does not make sense to define lumber variants based on color. For many types of products, there are existing business rules for how variants in each product category should be defined. In order to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction, our algorithm must respect this domain knowledge.",
                "1.1.4 Interpretability. Identifying product variants is a high priority task that involves many business stakeholders. In order to effectively collaborate with them, we need a business friendly justification for why certain products were grouped together. When business users have a clear understanding of why the algorithm is grouping certain products, they are more likely to adopt the algorithm on their set of products or contribute their subject matter expertise towards improving the algorithm.",
                "Based on the above requirements, we frame the problem of identifying product variants into a constrained clustering problem, where we incorporate business rules and human knowledge into the algorithm as constraints. In order to improve recall, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sensible fuzzy matching on the constraints to overcome the noise in the textual data. First, we extract product family name from unstructured product title. Then, we measure the similarity between model numbers of two product variant candidates using edit distance. Beside several business constraints, there are cluster level constraints that the product variants must have the same family name and the model number difference must be within a certain range. We will discuss the details in the Section 3."

Product similarity can be computed in various ways.",

Hence token-based methods are useful where raw strings are not matched but are converted to tokens first (by splitting them using a delimiter). Jaccard index is a popular token-based similarity metric.",
                        "Besides databases, product duplicate detection is addressed for Web data obtained from e-commerce websites. The key difference between finding similar products from a relational database and from the Web is that Web data is very noisy whereas databases are structured. [10] propose a hierarchical clustering method to cluster products from multiple websites and apply it to detect similar products in a dataset of TVs. Their approach builds upon the Title Model Words Method (TMWM) [12] which extracts entities from product titles and matches them using cosine similarity. Then additional rules are applied to detect product duplicates. Another method that their approach uses is the Hybrid Similarity Method (HSM) [2] which adds product attributes to compute similarities (beyond just product titles).",
                        "Another relevant line of work [8] uses the term product resolution and heuristic methods (or rules) to extract structure from unstructured data and find product duplicates. [5] is also a rulebased filtering approach that does pairwise comparison between punctuation-delimited textual chunks and determines if the chunks are similar or not. Pairwise computations save time especially if the dataset is large. Another method that builds upon this idea is [4] where the authors propose to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [3] to detect candidates for pairwise comparison and compare model words from product titles (proposed by [11]) as well as descriptions.",
                        "Despite of the large body of work on product deduplication, these methods do not directly address our application. Rather than identifying the most similar products, our task is to group items together conditional on variable attributes defined by domain experts for each specific category. This uncompromisable condition makes the task more challenging and interesting."

They predict whether a pair of products belong to the same product variant family based on a limited set of generic product attributes. These attributes are the same across all categories and include dimensions, price, weight, manufacturer, supplier, and model number. For each of these attributes, a distance metric is computed between each pair of items. These distance metrics are used as features to train a random forest model, which gives a probability of product similarity.",
                        "One drawback of this classification method is that it uses the same standard attributes for all categories. When the product catalog is very diverse, we found that classification algorithms using these standard attributes do not perform well. In particular, the attributes may be unavailable or not relevant to certain types of products.",
                        "Many categories may not have standard attributes like Product Width or Product Length defined. These missing values degrade the performance of the model. We used standard techniques (e.g. average or dominant values of similar products) to fill in missing values. In addition, some products, such as windows, are designed to vary on these standard dimension attributes. Therefore, it often does not make sense to group based on similarity within these attributes. Figure 3 shows two faucets that should be classified as within the same product variant family. The distance features used in the model are shown in the table. In this example, many of the standard product dimensions have missing values and the faucets are not correctly identified as being product variants.",
                        "In contrast, our algorithm only uses two basic product attributes, product title and model number. Because they are required to make a product sellable, we rarely suffer from the missing value issue. In addition, our algorithm considers variable attributes defined by domain experts for each category in the process of extracting the product family name (will be discussed in Section 3.2). Therefore, our algorithm generated better results that satisfy the categoryspecific conditions."

However, it is worth noting that our algorithm is different from the traditional constrained clustering approach. From the definition, constrained clustering requires a pre-defined parameter k for the number of clusters. In contrast, our algorithm does not limit on the number of product variant groups, and can allow the formation of product variant groups to adapt to the properties of each category.
