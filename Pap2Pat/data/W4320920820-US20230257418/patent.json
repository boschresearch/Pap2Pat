                        "Brain and central nervous system (CNS) diseases are leading causes of disability worldwide, accounting for significant hospitalization and prolonged care. Treatment for these diseases remains challenging due to the inability of many therapeutic agents, especially hydrophobic and large molecular weight drugs, to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB). Direct delivery of therapeutics from the nasal cavity into the brain (intranasal (i.n.) delivery) bypasses the BBB and BCB, providing an alternative route to invasive methods of drug administration (Bitter et al. Curr Probl Dermatol 2011, 40, 20-35; Pardeshi C. V. & Belgamwar V. S., Expert Opin Drug Deliv 2013, 10 (7), 957-72; Frey, W. H. n., Drug Deliv. Techn. 2002, 2, 46-49). A few therapeutic agents, including peptides and proteins otherwise impermeable to the BBB and BCB, have been delivered to the brain via this route (Lalatsa et al., Mol Pharm 2014, 11 (4), 1081-93; Illum, L., J Control Release 2003, 87 (1-3), 187-98). However, drug hydrophobicity, molecular weight and degree of ionization affect the drug transport into the brain after intranasal administration.",
                        "Intranasal delivery exploits the olfactory or trigeminal cranial nerve systems which initiate in the brain and terminate in the nasal cavity at the olfactory neuroepithelium or respiratory epithelium. CNS targeting action can be achieved due to direct transport of a drug from the submucosal space of the nose into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment of the brain, avoiding systemic circulation of the drug, and reducing the risk of systemic side effects as well as hepatic/renal clearing. However, intranasal-CSF administration has limitations, including gradual elimination of the drug from the CSF into the blood due to the normal replacement of the CSF (four to five times daily), and the logarithmic decrease of brain penetration by drug with distance from the CSF surface. Using current methods, the quantities of drug administered intranasally that are transported directly from nose-to-brain are very low, typically less than 0.1%. To improve i.n. drug delivery to the brain, two main approaches have been utilized: (a) modification of nasal membrane permeability by employment of absorption enhancers, such as surfactants, bile salts, fatty acids and polymeric enhancers (Davis, S. & S. Illum, L., Clin Pharmacokinet 2003, 42 (13), 1107-28; Duan, X. & Mao, S., Drug Discov Today 2010, 15 (11-12), 416-27) and (b) use of nanoparticle systems that can carry drugs across the mucosal barrier and protect drugs from degradation in the nasal cavity (Ali et al., Curr Pharm Des 2010, 16 (14), 1644-53; Illum L., J Pharm Sci 2007, 96 (3), 473-83; Mistry et al., Int J Pharm 2009, 379 (1), 146-57). However, these approaches each possess shortcomings. In the case of absorption-enhancing molecules, local or systemic intolerance after inhalation and membrane damage produced by many enhancers represent major limitations. Moreover, suboptimal delivery due to limited transmucosal transfer of nanoparticles, slow drug release (which limits bioavailability), and short residence time in the nasal cavity (due to mucociliary clearance) are limitations typically associated with nanoparticles.",
                        "The challenge remains to improve the transfer efficiency of the drug from the olfactory epithelium to the brain, in order to safely, predictably and successfully reach therapeutically-relevant drug levels in the targeted brain regions. Therefore, the development of novel strategies that effectively deliver therapeutic agents into the brain is of great importance."

                        "Described herein are novel cyclic peptides, cyclic peptide conjugates, compositions, kits and methods that address the need for effective intranasal delivery to the brain of therapeutic agents such as peptides, proteins, small molecules and nanoparticles. They can be administered to a subject having a neurological disease, disorder, or disabling condition (e.g., schizophrenia, meningitis, migraine, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, pain, addiction, overdose etc.) for treatment of the neurological disease, disorder or disabling condition. They can be administered to a subject having more than one neurological disease, disorder or disabling condition. The cyclic peptides and cyclic peptide conjugates are based on a novel strategy of grafting (inserting) a biologically active peptide within and/or conjugating (joining together) protein or small molecule onto the scaffold of a cyclic peptide that exhibits bio-adhesive properties, in particular, specific binding to cells of the olfactory epithelium of nasal mucosa. The permeability of nasal mucosa to a variety of compounds, including very large and polar molecules, contributes to the unexpected success of this novel delivery method. The cyclic peptides and cyclic peptide conjugates described herein include an Odorranalectin (OL) sequence or modified OL sequence as a scaffold. OL is a 17-amino acid cyclic peptide having the sequence Y1A2S3P4K5-cyclo[C6F7R8Y9P10N11G12V13O14A15C16]T17 (SEQ ID NO:1), that exhibits lectin-like properties, and that can specifically bind to L-fucose, which is widely distributed on the olfactory epithelium of nasal mucosa. The novel strategy for improved i.n. delivery of therapeutic agents (e.g., pharmaceutically relevant bioactive peptides) to the brain is based on: a) exploitation of a high abundance of L-fucose on olfactory cells for extending the residence time of a biologically active peptide or protein in the nasal cavity, and b) grafting or conjugating of the biologically active protein or peptide sequence into or to the scaffold of fucose-binding OL with nose-to-brain homing capability. The L-fucose binding site in OL consists of only five amino acids, Lys5, Cys6, Phe7, Cys16 and Thr17. Therefore, modification of the OL amino acid sequence that is not directly involved in fucose binding provides novel and unique analogs with desired therapeutic activity and preserved fucose affinity for successful nose-to-brain delivery. In some embodiments of a cyclic peptide conjugate as described herein, a small molecule is attached (conjugated) directly or indirectly to OL or an OL analogue.",
                        "It was discovered that a biologically active peptide (an opioid receptor ligand) could be grafted into and/or conjugated to an OL sequence and that the resultant cyclic peptide, after i.n. administration, was delivered to a mammalian brain where the biologically active peptide retained its functional activity. The experimental results described herein also demonstrate the ability of a combinatorial library that includes a plurality of cyclic peptides as described herein to identify ligands for receptors of interest. Based on these experimental results, the cyclic peptides and cyclic peptide conjugates described herein may be delivered via intranasal delivery for treating neurologic diseases, neurologic disorders, and disabling neurologic conditions, and may be used to screen for a ligand(s) for a receptor of interest.",

                        "Novel cyclic peptides and cyclic peptide conjugates and compositions containing them, as well as methods of using them, are described herein. A novel therapy has been developed for the treatment of neurological diseases, disorders, and disabling conditions based on the intranasal delivery of a cyclic peptide or cyclic peptide conjugate as described herein. Combinatorial libraries that include a plurality of cyclic peptides have also been developed and can be used to screen for a ligand(s) for a receptor of interest. The experimental results described in more detail in the Examples below demonstrate the therapeutic utility of the cyclic peptides and cyclic peptide conjugates that are delivered intranasally (i.n.) for treating neurologic diseases, disorders and conditions such as addiction, for example. A known \u03b4 opioid receptor ligand (DOR), D-Ala-D-Leu enkephalin (DADLE), was grafted (inserted) into an OL scaffold and it was demonstrated that the novel DADLE-OL cyclic peptide retains the properties of both parent peptides (the DADLE and the OL), including opioid receptor ligand functional activity. To demonstrate suitability of an OL scaffold for additional structural modifications, OL analogues differing in the position and sequences of the grafted opioid peptide ligands were synthesized and their in vivo activity was assessed. It was shown that the additional OL analogues can be delivered via the intranasal route to the mouse brain and produce biological effects in the brain in a concentration-dependent manner. To identify novel opioid ligands based on the OL scaffold, a focused positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial library (PSCL) of 2,476,099 cyclic peptides was prepared and screened for affinity for m, d and k opioid receptors, from which novel OL-based ligands were identified. These data demonstrate the feasibility of the molecular grafting approach for the design of novel OL analogs for direct nose-to-brain delivery of therapeutic peptides, proteins, small molecules and other therapeutic agents without undesirable side effects. They also demonstrate the utility of cyclic peptide combinatorial libraries for screening for and identifying therapeutic agents (e.g., receptor ligands). The described strategy has broad implications for the development of novel drugs and delivery carriers for brain targeting and the treatment of neurological diseases, disorders and disabling conditions."

A cyclic peptide may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X can be any protein or peptide sequence having a length (i.e., m) of at least 3 (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) amino acids, but can be up to several thousand amino acids in length. For example, X can be Tyr-Ala-Ser-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 4) which are amino acids 1\u02dc4 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO:1). The amino acids of X can be L-amino acids (e.g., all L-amino acids), D-amino acids (e.g., all D-amino acids), nonproteinogenic (synthetic) amino acids, peptidomimetics, or a mix thereof. These amino acids can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, or a mix thereof. Generally, the order and types of amino acids is determined based upon the interaction of the cyclic peptide with its biological target(s). In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X1 can be any basic amino acid (e.g., Lys, Arg). This amino acid can be a naturally occurring amino acid or a non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acid. X1 corresponds to position (amino acid) 8 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1). In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X2 can be any 5 amino acids, and corresponds to amino acids 9-13 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1). These amino acids can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, or a mix thereof. In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, the amino acids of X3 correspond to amino acids 14 and 15 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), and can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or a mix thereof.",
                                "The biologically active peptide or protein can be any peptide or protein that exhibits a an effect (e.g., beneficial effect, adverse effect) on living matter (e.g., a cell, cells, organelle, tissue, etc.). Examples of biologically active peptides or proteins include receptors, proteins, and enzymes present in the CNS. In a typical embodiment, the biologically active peptide or protein is a receptor, protein or enzyme present in the CNS. In some embodiments, the biologically active peptide or protein is an opioid receptor ligand or analogue thereof. In such embodiments, one or both of (X)m and X2 can be an opioid receptor ligand or analogue thereof. One embodiment of a cyclic peptide in which both (X)m and X2 are or include opioid receptor ligands is the cyclic peptide TIPP-EM1-OL Y1P2W3F4K5-cyclo[C6F7R8Y9Tic10F11F12V13L14A15C16]T17 (SEQ ID NO: 7), a dual-acting cyclic peptide containing a MOR agonist (MOR active sequence) inserted into positions 1\u02dc4 of OL (SEQ ID NO:1) and a DOR antagonist (DOR active sequence) inserted into positions 9-12 of OL (SEQ ID NO:1). In TIPP-EM1-OL: Xm is EM1; X1 is Arg; X2 is Tipp-Val; and X3 is Leu-Ala. Generally in these embodiments, the cyclic peptide modulates activity of the opioid receptor(s). Examples of opioid receptor ligands include a \u03b4 opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist, a DOR agonist, a \u03bc opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist, a MOR agonist, a \u03ba opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist, and a KOR agonist. In the Examples below, OL-based MOR, DOR and KOR agonists and DOR antagonists were generated by modifying OL residues 1-4, 9-12, and 9-13 of SEQ ID NO:1. Opioid receptor ligands and assays involving same are described, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/145,901, incorporated herein by reference.",

Any small molecule can be conjugated to a cyclic peptide of the general Formula I. Specific examples of small molecules include 5HTrp, naloxone, serotonin, dopamine, L-DOPA, epinephrine, norepinephrine, histamine, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine, cannabidiol (CBD), CBD derivative, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), THC derivative, nabilone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), desvenlafaxine, milnacipran, levomilnacipran, memantine, and pramipexole.

In this cyclic peptide, Xm is 5HTrp-Ala-Ser-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 14); X1 is Arg; X2 is a KOR agonist (Gly-Phe-Trp-Pro-Lys SEQ ID NO: 15); and X3 is Leu-Ala. In other embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a peptide or a protein, e.g., a growth hormone or an opioid receptor ligand or analogue thereof, or a nanoparticle.",

A cyclic peptide conjugate may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A specific example of such a cyclic peptide conjugate is:\n\nnaloxone-C1A2S3P4K5-cyclo[C6F7R8Y9P10N11G12V13L14A15C16]T17 (SEQ ID NO: 17). In this embodiment, X is Cys and the therapeutic agent is a small molecule\u2014naloxone\u2014directly attached to the N-terminus of the cyclic peptide via a cleavable/bond linker. However, the therapeutic agent can be conjugated to the cyclic peptide by any suitable method, chemistry or means. In embodiments in which X is a linker, the linker can be any suitable linker, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), sebacic acid, suberic acid, dithio-bis-maleimidoethane (DTME), dimethyl pimelimidate, etc. The therapeutic agent can be any agent suitable for treating a neurological disease, disorder and disabling condition (e.g., peptides, proteins, small molecules, nanoparticles). In an embodiment in which the therapeutic agent is a small molecule, as with the cyclic peptides described above, the small molecule can be any small molecule. Similarly, in an embodiment in which the therapeutic agent is a peptide or protein, any therapeutic peptide or protein can be used.",
                                "Small molecules, proteins, nanoparticles and other therapeutic agents can be conjugated to a cyclic peptide by any suitable protocol. Typically, the small molecule or other therapeutic agent is conjugated to the N-terminus of the cyclic peptide. Small molecules and other therapeutic agents can also be conjugated, for example, using known chemistries (see Wen T. and M. L. Becker, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2014, 43:p. 7013). As another example, small molecules can be conjugated via amide bond (peptide chemistry). As another example, small molecules (and other therapeutic agents) can be conjugated by \u201cclick\u201d reactions. Different types of \u201cclick\u201d reactions have been developed to synthesize peptide conjugates, including Cu(I) catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), strain promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), thiol-ene reaction, Michael addition, oxyme ligation, Diels-Alder reaction, Staudinger ligation and native chemical ligation, (Wen Tang, Matthew L. Becker, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2014, 43, 7013-7039). In some embodiments, the N-terminal part of OL possessing a preselected functional group(s) suitable for the above mentioned \u201cclick\u201d reaction is selected as a place for conjugation. The main limitation of the \u201cclick\u201d reactions for the small molecule conjugation to peptide is that the desired functional groups must be compatible with the reaction conditions for peptide coupling, deprotection and cleavage. Alternatively, if the small molecule (or other therapeutic agent) possesses the amino or carboxyl functional groups, standard peptide coupling reactions can be used.",
                                "To demonstrate the feasibility of small molecule coupling to OL and to show that these conjugates exhibit biological activities, OLKOR-L1-5HTrp and OL-naloxone analogues were produced. 5HTrp, a serotonin biosynthetic precursors, was coupled to the N-terminal Ala of OL using standard solid-phase peptide synthetic protocol. 5HTrp was released from the OLKOR-L1-5HTrp scaffold as evidenced by the increased 5HTrp concentration in the mouse midbrain following intranasal administration of OLKOR-L1-5HTrp, FIG. 14. Naloxone is coupled to the OL scaffold using thiol-ene reaction. Naloxone is a \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist and reversal agent used to mitigate risk for opioid-induced respiratory depression by displacing the full opioid agonists. For this purpose, the N-terminal Tyr1 in the OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) was replaced with Cys1, whereas acryl naloxone derivate required for thiol-ene reaction was prepared as described previously (Diego et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19, 1767-1774). As Shown in FIG. 16, naloxone-OL was prepared by adding acryl naloxone to the peptidyl-resin precursor possessing N-terminal Cys with free thiol group. The final product OL-naloxone was purified by RP-HPLC as in the case of OL and related analogs its Mw was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis.",
                                "Compositions for treating a neurological disease, disorder and disabling condition in an individual include a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic peptide or cyclic peptide conjugate as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the composition further includes a second therapeutic agent. In an embodiment of a composition for treating addiction, for example, the additional (second) therapeutic agent may be a drug that targets opioid receptors, dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, cannabinoid receptors etc, and that is different from the opioid receptor ligand of the cyclic peptide or cyclic peptide conjugate. In an embodiment of a composition for treating Alzheimer's disease, for example, the additional (second) therapeutic agent may be an Alzheimer's disease treatment that is different from the biologically active peptide or protein or therapeutic agent (for treating Alzheimer's disease) of the cyclic peptide or cyclic peptide conjugate. In such embodiments, the cyclic peptide or cyclic peptide conjugate and the additional (second) therapeutic agent may have a synergistic effect.",

A target cell is any cell in the CNS. In one embodiment, target cells are neurons. In other embodiments, target cells are non-neuronal cells. Cells to be targeted can be a mix of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The cyclic peptides, cyclic peptide conjugates and compositions described herein may be used to treat any type of neurological disease or disorder or disabling condition, including for example, schizophrenia, meningitis, migraine, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, pain and addiction, or a combination thereof."

                                "In one embodiment, a combinatorial library includes a plurality of cyclic peptides of the general Formula I: (X)m-Lys-cyclo-[Cys-Phe-X1-X2-X3-Cys]-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 6). In this formula, X is an amino acid sequence having a length of m amino acids (m is at least 3); X1 is a basic amino acid; X2 is an amino acid sequence having a length of 5 amino acids; X3 is an amino acid sequence having a length of 2 amino acids; and at least one of (X)m and X2 includes a biologically active peptide or protein (e.g., an opioid receptor ligand or analogue thereof). A cyclic peptide may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X can be any protein or peptide sequence having a length (i.e., m) of at least 3 (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) amino acids, but can be up to several thousand amino acids in length. For example, X can be Tyr-Ala-Ser-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 4) which are amino acids 1\u02dc4 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO:1). The amino acids of X can be L-amino acids (e.g., all L-amino acids), D-amino acids (e.g., all D-amino acids), nonproteinogenic amino acids, proteinogenic amino acids, peptidomimetics, or a mix thereof. These amino acids can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, or a mix thereof. Generally, the order and types of amino acids is determined based upon the interaction of the cyclic peptide with its biological target(s). In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X1 can be any basic amino acid (e.g., Lys, Arg). This amino acid can be a naturally occurring amino acid or a non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acid. X1 corresponds to position (amino acid) 8 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1). In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, X2 can be any 5 amino acids, and corresponds to amino acids 9-13 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1). These amino acids can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, or a mix thereof. In a cyclic peptide of Formula 1, the amino acids of X3 correspond to amino acids 14 and 15 of the naturally occurring OL sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), and can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or a mix thereof. In a combinatorial library, a combinatorial modification can be done at the N-terminal part of the OL molecule, at the \u03b2-turn region, or both.",
                                "In another embodiment, a combinatorial library includes a plurality of cyclic peptides of the general Formula II: Tyr-Ala-Ser-Pro-Lys-cyclo [Cys-Phe-Arg-X-Leu-Ala-Cys]-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 18), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In this formula, X is an amino acid sequence having a length of 5 amino acids and is a mixture of D-amino acids and L-amino acids. These amino acids can be naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring (synthetic) amino acids, or a mix thereof. In one example of such a combinatorial library, at least a portion of the cyclic peptides have an affinity for at least one opioid receptor and the ability to modulate activity of the at least one opioid receptor (e.g., MOR, KOR and DOR). However, a combinatorial library as described herein can include cyclic peptides that have an affinity for any receptor of interest.",
                                "The combinatorial libraries can be used to identify a ligand for a receptor of interest, for example, to identify opioid cyclic peptides that have affinity for an opioid receptor. In one embodiment, a method of identifying at least one opioid cyclic peptide includes screening a combinatorial library as described herein using a suitable assay. Examples of such screening assays include competitive assays such as competition binding assays, competitive inhibition assays, and functional activity assays (e.g. cAMP and \u03b2-arrestin assays). Any suitable assays can be used. Additional examples include ex vivo bioassays for screening (e.g., the isolated guinea pig ileum assay), and screening by administration to suitable animal species (e.g., rodents) and examining relevant physiological or behavioral effects (for opioids, these would include assays of respiration or analgesia, respectively). Once a candidate opioid cyclic peptide, for example, is identified, any suitable assay for testing opioid cyclic peptides for affinity, selectivity and activity can be used. For example, a variety of assays may be employed to test whether the cyclic peptides identified in a combinatorial library as described herein exhibit high affinity and selectivity for an opioid receptor. Receptor assays are well known in the art and \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR), \u03b4-opioid receptor (DOR), and \u03ba-opioid receptor (KOR) opioid receptors from several species have been cloned. Although these cloned receptors readily allow a particular candidate opioid cyclic peptide to be screened, natural sources of mammalian opioid receptors are also useful for screening, as is well known in the art (Dooley C T et al. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18848-56, 1998). Thus, screening against one or more of MOR, DOR and KOR, whether of recombinant or natural origin, may be carried out in order to determine the selectivity of candidate opioid cyclic peptides for the MOR, DOR or KOR. Additionally, candidate opioid cyclic peptides can be screened by administration to suitable animal species (e.g., rodents) and examining relevant physiological or behavioral effects such as respiration and analgesia."

However, conventional drug delivery methods are inefficient in delivering a number of therapeutic agents to the brain, especially hydrophilic and large molecular weight (MW) drugs such as peptides and proteins. Both the BBB and BCB restrict the transport of these therapeutic agents from systemic circulation into the CNS. The data described below demonstrate the utility of the cyclic peptide-based platform for i.n. drug delivery to the brain, including novel CNS peptide-based drugs suitable for i.n. delivery that have high selectivity, in vivo efficacy and tolerance. This approach to deliver peptide-based drug directly to the brain via the i.n. route has a variety of therapeutic and prophylactic applications, including, as non-limiting examples: analgesics, anti-convulsants, antidotes, addiction, anti-viral, antibiotics, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neurodegenerative.",

In addition, DADLE-OL binds DOR with an affinity approximately one order of magnitude lower than DADLE, but improved selectivity for DOR over MOR, Table 1. The lack of a positively charged N-terminal Tyr residue and the conformational constraint may explain lower affinity of DADLE-OL toward DOR in comparison to DADLE. The unmodified OL does not bind any of the three opioid receptors tested, Table 1. To confirm that the residues 5-7, 16 and 17 in the OL scaffold are crucial for fucose binding, a control peptide composed of a scrambled OL sequence was synthesized, Table 1. As expected, affinity of the control peptide toward asialofetuin is significantly lower compared to OL, indicating that these residues are not amenable to modification. Similar affinity toward asialofetuin was observed for DADLE-OL II. However, this peptide exhibits lower affinity toward DOR and does not discriminate between MOR and DOR.",

The level of OL in the mouse brain at the selected time intervals parallels those in the mouse nose. The level of DADLE-OL in the mouse brain 30 minutes after i.n. administration was identical to the level of OL, indicating that grafting of DADLE sequence into OL did not affect its nose-to-brain transfer ability, FIG. 3B. No DADLE-OL was detected in the mouse brain 30 and 60 minutes after i.p. administration. The functional activity of DADLE-OL was evaluated by antinociception produced in vivo in mice measured with the 55\u00b0 C. warm water tail-withdrawal test, FIG. 4. Although no adverse effects were observed in mice at the highest tested i.n. doses of OL and DADLE-OL, only DADLE-OL exhibited dose- and time-dependent antinociception. Significant effects were observed at all tested doses 2 minutes after i.n. administration, with the peak effect 30 minutes after administration of 600 \u03bcg, FIG. 4. DADLE-OL failed to show significant antinociceptive activity after i.p. administration, and i.n. administration of the individual parent peptides, DADLE and OL, did not themselves produce antinociception. Furthermore, when DADLE-OL was administered to mice lacking MOR or KOR, or to mice pretreated with the opioid antagonist naloxone or DOR-selective antagonist naltrindole, the tail withdrawal test results show a decreased response only in mice lacking MOR and in mice pretreated with naloxone, suggesting that DADLE-OL-mediated antinociception was predominantly MOR-mediated. This is expected because DADLE-OL does not bind KOR, Table 1, and because of its mixed MOR/DOR activity, similar to the parent DADLE.",
                                "Although DADLE-OL induces significant antinociceptive effects in mice following i.n. administration, no impairment in motor coordination was observed using the rotarod test. In contrast, U50,488, a k-opioid receptor agonist used as a positive control, significantly impaired motor coordination in mice following i.p. administration. To demonstrate that the ligands exhibiting different opioid activity can be delivered into the brain via the i.n. route, a TIPP-OL analogue was prepared, FIG. 5. This analogue was prepared by grafting (conjugating) a sequence of known DOR antagonist TIPP (Tyr-Tic-Phe-PheOH [SEQ ID NO: 2]) (Schiller et al. Biopolymers 1999, 51 (6), 411-25.), using the same synthetic approach as described previously. As shown in FIG. 5, TIPP-OL fully antagonizes the effect of a potent DOR agonist SNC-80 in mice. In this experiment SNC-80 was i.c.v. administered following pretreatment with i.n. administration of TIPP-OL.",
                                "Based on the literature evidences showing that opioid compounds with mixed \u03bc agonist/\u03b4 antagonist properties may exhibit an antinociceptive effect with low propensity to induce side effects, bifunctional OL analogue, TIPP-EM1-OL, containing the \u03bc agonist endomorphin 1 (EM1) (Zadina et al., Nature. 1997; 386(6624):499-502, Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 3) grafted into the N-terminus and \u03b4 antagonist TIPP grafted into the \u03b2-turn region of the OL scaffold, was prepared, FIG. 6. Although not as potent as other OL analogues, TIPP-EM1-OL exhibits antinociceptive effects in mice following the i.n. administration. This experiment unequivocally demonstrated the suitability of the odorranalectin scaffold for a variety of chemical modifications (e.g., insertion of peptide sequences composed of L-, D- and nonproteinogenic amino acids; insertion of peptidomimetics; insertion of small molecules; insertion of proteins).",

                                "To validate this approach and to identify novel opioid ligands based on the OL scaffold, a focused PSCL of 2,476,099 cyclic peptides was produced, and this library was screened for affinity toward \u03bc, \u03b4 and \u03ba opioid receptors. The cyclic peptides in the prepared combinatorial library possess an unmodified fucose binding region (residues 5-7, 16 and 17 of SEQ ID NO: 1), whereas the sequence responsible for opioid receptors binding (residues 9-13 of SEQ ID NO: 1) was randomized.",
                                "Library Synthesis",
                                "The cyclic peptide synthetic combinatorial library was generated by the process of divide, couple and recombine using 19 commercially available D- and L-amino acids (Cys is omitted to avoid formation of more than one disulfide bond) using modified Fmoc SPPS strategy previously developed (Bionda et al., Eur J Med Chem 2016, 108, 354-363; Dooley, C T, Houghten, R, Life Sciences, 1993, 52: 1509-1517), FIG. 7. The comparison of several endogenous and synthetic opioid ligands showed that the opioid peptide sequence needs the presence of Pro or D-amino acid in position 2 for good interaction with opioid receptors. To maintain the same order of D- and L-amino acids as they appear in the sequences of these opioid ligands in the synthesized cyclic peptides, position 10 contains D-amino acids (corresponds to the position 2 in the sequences of endogenous and synthetic opioid ligands) whereas remaining positions in the OL sequence responsible for opioid activity were composed of L-amino acids. Using this approach, five sets of 95 cyclic peptide sub-libraries were prepared. The first set of 19 sub-libraries had specifically defined amino acids in position 9 of the sequence, and the remaining four positions consisted of mixtures of the 19 D- or 19 L-amino acids. The next set of cyclic peptide sub-libraries were defined by the amino acid in position 10, and the remaining positions contained all possible amino acid combinations. This process was thus repeated for the remaining amino acid residues. Variable positions were incorporated by coupling of a mixture of 19 Fmoc-protected amino acids in predetermined molar ratios to compensate for different coupling rates. However, protocol for on-resin disulfide bond formation using an oxidizing agent had to be optimized to avoid or minimize Met oxidation and Trp-peptide bond cleavage. For this purpose, use of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) was explored as an oxidizing agent for on-resin disulfide formation. Based on the literature reports, NCS is compatible with oxidation-prone Met and Trp, and it is compatible with peptides containing Boc and Trt protecting groups. It was found that 1.1 eq of NCS over a 1.5 hour period leads to complete disulfide bond formation with cca 60% Met oxidation. However, oxidized Met residues in peptide thioesters can be reduced rapidly with NH4I to the corresponding sulfide by using (CH3)2S as co-reductant. Addition of 20 eq of NH4I and 20 eq of (CH3)2S into the reaction mixture and shaking this mixture at room temperature for 2 hours resulted in complete reduction of oxidized Met without destruction of the existing disulfide bridge. Under the applied experimental conditions for on-resin disulfide bond formation, no cleavage of tryptophanyl peptide bond was observed. The completion of peptide coupling was monitored by the Kaiser (ninhidryn) test and the Ellman test was carried out to monitor the completion of disulfide bond formation. Using the described optimized synthetic strategy, a PSCL containing 2,476,099 cyclic peptides was generated, FIG. 7.",

                                "The prepared PSCL was screened for the identification of novel cyclic opioid-like peptides in three different competitive assays using human opioid clones expressed in CHO cells. Competition binding assays were conducted using [3H]-DAMGO, [3H]-DSLET and [3H]-U69,593 as MOR, DOR and KOR radioligands, respectively. In brief, binding assays were carried out in 1 mL polypropylene tubes in a 96-well format, and the reaction was terminated by filtration through GF-B filters. Bound radioactivity was counted on an LKB \u03b2-plate Liquid Scintillation Counter. Competitive inhibition assays were performed using 0.2 and 1 mg/mL of peptide mixtures. The assays were repeated twice. Screening assay showed significantly stronger affinities of synthesized peptides toward MOR than toward DOR and KOR. Use of 1 mg/mL of peptide mixtures in the screening assays clearly indicated amino acid residues responsible for selective DOR and KOR binding. On the other hand, 0.2 mg/mL of peptide mixtures showed significant inhibition (up to 60%) of radioligand binding only for MOR. Amino acid residues that drive opioid receptor selectivity are shown in Table 2. The performed screening assay provided valuable structure-binding data and clearly demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to identify individual OL-based cyclic peptides selective for MOR, DOR and KOR."

In the DADLE-OL II, OL's four N-terminal amino acids (Tyr1-Ala2-Ser4-Pro4) (SEQ ID NO: 4) were replaced with the DADLE sequence. As shown in Table 1, DADLE-OL II binds asialofetuin with an affinity (Kd=33 \u03bcM) similar to OL (Kd=42 \u03bcM), Table 1, suggesting that this modification does not affect the peptide's binding to carbohydrates and thus its ability to transit from nose to the brain. However, lower affinity (Kd=275 nM) was determined for DOR in comparison to DADLE-OL (Kd=64 nM) and this peptide does not discriminate between MOR and DOR, Table 1. The assessment of this peptide's activity in the 55\u00b0 C. warm water tail-withdrawal test, FIG. 8, demonstrated that the modification of the N-terminal part also leads to an active analogue in vivo. Lower activity of DADLE-OL II in the tail-withdrawal test in mice in comparison to the DADLE-OL can be explained by this peptide's lower affinity toward DOR.",
                                "Identified Novel Cyclic Peptide Opioid Ligands",
                                "Opioid receptors are key targets in the management of pain. Most clinically used opioid drugs are MOR agonists, with liabilities of tolerance, physical dependence and addiction mediated by this receptor. Activation of the other opioid receptors also produces analgesia, but with unique strengths and liabilities. DOR agonists produce minimal analgesia in acute pain models, but have been speculated to generate analgesia in models of chronic pain, perhaps because DOR responses are up-regulated. Like the MOR, the DOR positively modulates the rewarding state, but seemingly to a lesser extent, suggesting a lower abuse liability than MOR agonists. In contrast, KOR agonists are effective pain suppressors and unlike MOR agonists, do not cause respiratory failure or impair GI transit. KORs are located in the spinal cord and the brain stem and part of their analgesic effect is due to the direct inhibition of neuronal pathways transmitting nociceptive (pain) information.",
                                "Moreover, KOR agonists not only possess analgesic activity but also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, suggesting their potential value in the treatment of these conditions. KOR agonists developed to date also exhibit undesirable dysphoria and aversion attributed to KOR suppression of dopamine and serotonin release. Still, considering the benefits KOR offer in regulating pain and inflammation and the absence of abuse, novel KOR agonists lacking the undesirable side effects represent an attractive lead compounds for the development of novel classes of drugs for pain. Serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as antidepressant drugs amitriptyline and doxepin, represent another class of pain medication that has been successfully used for the management of chronic neuropathic pain. However, SNRIs have not been successful in all pain conditions and the pain-relieving properties of these drugs may not be efficacious for pain related to severe trauma. Alternatively, combining KOR agonist activity with norepinephrine and/or serotonin delivery into the brain may improve chronic pain management when more than one physiological mechanism or system is implicated and may potentially minimize side effects associated with the KOR activation.",
                                "To further identify novel and unique opioid-OL peptides based on the strategy above, an OL-based PSCL (95 mixtures containing a total of 2,476,099 distinct cyclic peptides) was prepared and these mixtures were screened for binding affinity to human MOR, DOR and KOR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cyclic peptides in the PSCL possess an unmodified L-fucose binding region (residues 5-7, 16 and 17 of SEQ ID NO:1), whereas the sequence responsible for opioid receptors binding (residues 9-13 of SEQ ID NO:1) was randomized. Amino acid residues found to convey opioid receptor selectivity are shown in Table 2. The novel MOR agonist (OLMOR-L1 FIG. 9A) showed dose-dependent antinociception, FIG. 9B, and approximately 20% improvement in analgesic activity using the 55\u00b0 C. warm water tail-withdrawal test at 3\u00d7 lower concentrations (200 ug/mL) over the parent DADLE-OL (600 ug/mL), FIG. 9C. However, OLMOR-L1 did not show the desired MOR selectivity in the tail-withdrawal assay using the knockout mice, FIG. 9D. As shown in FIG. 10, OLMOR-L1 did not affect motor coordination and balance in mice using the rotarod test, suggesting a possibility for fewer side effects. In addition, this peptide did not induce significant conditioned place preference or aversion in mice. A lack of conditioned place preference observed for OLMOR-L1 could possibly be explained by this peptide's absence of in vivo selectivity toward opioid receptors. With synthesis and assessing the analgesic activity of OLMOR-L1 in a tail-withdrawal assay, it was demonstrated that it is possible to identify more potent OL-base opioid ligands using the described combinatorial chemistry approach.",
                                "Similarly, a novel OL-based KOR ligand, OLKOR-L1, was identified based on the OL combinatorial library screening, FIG. 11 and Table 2. Marked improvement in analgesic activity was observed for OLKOR-L1, FIGS. 12 and 13C. OLKOR-L1 exhibited dose and time dependent antinociception in the mouse 55\u00b0 C. warm water tail withdrawal assay following i.n. administration, with the peak activity observed after 30 minutes at a dose of 60 \u03bcg/mL. At 60 \u03bcg/mL OLKOR-L1 showed approximately 20% more potent antinociception in mice than the DADLE-OL at 600 \u03bcg/mL measured with the tail withdrawal test, FIG. 12. Importantly, OLKOR-L1 also exhibits antiallodynic effects in the mouse chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, FIG. 13C. In this experiment, the analgesic efficacy of OLKOR-L1 (200 \u03bcg i.n.) was comparable to the effect of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), but with reduced loss of activity over 80 minutes as was the case for morphine. Importantly, no impairment in motor coordination in mice was observed in the rotarod test, FIG. 10, and no other adverse effects were observed following the i.n. administration of OLKOR-L1 (100 \u03bcg ), positioning OLKOR-L 1 as a significant improvement over traditional opioid drugs. In addition, the conditioned place preference (CPP) data indicated that OLKOR-L1 does not produce reward (characteristic of morphine) nor conditioned place aversion (CPA)\u2014characteristic of traditional dysphoria produced by KOR agonists) in mice.",
                                "Neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine have been implicated as primary mediators of endogenous analgesic mechanisms in the pain pathway. Preclinical data suggests that persistent and neuropathic pain may be inhibited by enhancement of serotonin and norepinephrine transition, and deficiencies in one or both of these neurotransmitters may contribute to perception of pain. Moreover, animal studies have shown that SNRIs block pain-related behaviors. To test if the combination of KOR agonist activity with simultaneous delivery of norepinephrine and/or serotonin into the brain may improve OLKOR-L1 analgesic activity as well as neutralize the undesired side effects associated with KOR activation (polypharmacy approach), an OLKOR-L1 analogue was prepared. N-terminal Tyr1 and Ala2 in the OLKOR-L1 sequence that are rapidly hydrolyzed under physiologically relevant conditions are ideally suited for replacement with 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTrp), L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), or their analogues and thus for the delivery of these molecules to the brain. OLKOR-L1 possessing N-terminal 5-HTrp (OLKOR-L1-5HTrp) was prepared, FIG. 11, and its in vivo activity was assessed, FIG. 13. OLKOR-L1-5HTrp exhibited dose and time dependent antinociception in the mouse 55\u00b0 C. warm water tail withdrawal assay following i.n. administration, with the peak activity observed after 30 minutes at a dose of 60 \u03bcg/mL, FIG. 13A. In comparison to the parent OLKOR-L1 and the controls, morphine and gabapentin, OLKOR-L1-5HTrp (200 \u03bcg, i.n.) showed significant improvement in the analgesic efficacy in the tail-withdrawal assay, FIG. 13B, and in the CCI model, FIG. 13C. The CPP data indicated that OLKOR-L1 and its analogue OLKOR-L1-5HTrp do not produce reward in mice, characteristic of morphine. However, OLKOR-L1-5HTrp produced CPA in mice, much like the KOR agonist U50,488 used as a control. Conditioned place aversion was not observed for the parent peptide OLKOR-L1, suggesting a possibility that this undesired effect can be eliminated by further structural optimization.",
                                "Following intranasal administration of OLKOR-L1 or its analogue OLKOR-L1-5HTrp to knockout (KO) mice lacking MOR, DOR or KOR, the tail withdrawal test showed a significantly decreased response in KOR-KO mice, suggesting that OLKOR-L1/OLKOR-L1-5HTrp-mediated antinociception was predominantly KOR-mediated.",
                                "Overall, OLKOR-L1 and its analogue OLKOR-L1-5HTrp are promising analgesic with efficacy comparable to clinically used drugs such as morphine and gabapentin in a battery of pain assays but with longer duration and fewer side effects.",
                                "Analysis of the mouse brain 30 min after intranasal delivery of OLKOR-L1-5HTrp using RP-HPLC method with electrochemical detection showed significant increase in 5-HTrp accumulation in the midbrain, FIG. 14. Anatomical and physiological studies identified the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and its descending projections to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and spinal cord dorsal horn, as a primary anatomical pathway mediating opioid-based analgesia. Thus, presence of OLKOR-L1-5HTrp and 5-HTrp in the mid brain may explain this peptide's analgesic activity.",
                                "These data clearly demonstrated that using the approach of grafting (conjugating) a bioactive sequence (biologically active peptide or protein) into the OL scaffold (SEQ ID NO: 1) described herein can not only deliver known opioid peptide ligands into the brain, but also can generate novel ligands with improved activity and without undesirable side effects.",
                                "Peptides Stability Under Physiologically Relevant Conditions and Mode of Action Stability of DADLE-OL in 100% human cerebrospinal fluid and 100% mouse brain homogenate at 37\u00b0 C. was determined. The disappearance of the intact peptides and formation of proteolytic products was monitored by RP-HPLC and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. As in the case of the natural product OL, proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal Tyr1 and Ala2 in the DADLE OL was observed almost immediately in the 100% mouse brain homogenate. After incubation for 24 hours the fragment 1 is isolated as the only remaining fragment (shown in FIG. 15). In contrast, no degradation of DADLE-OL was observed in 100% human CSF even after incubation for 24h. These data suggest that DADLE-OL acts as a prodrug. Once diffused into the brain, DOR active sequence is released due to proteolytic hydrolysis of DADLE-OL. Fragment 1 was synthesized, and activities of the parent DADLE-OL and fragment 1 were tested in the cAMP inhibition assay (cAMP AlphaScreen\u2122 Assay, Perkin Elmer). As shown in FIG. 15B, fragment 1 inhibited cAMP production with IC50 value of 26.8 nM, whereas no activity was observed for the cyclic peptide DADLE-OL under the same experimental conditions. These data suggest that DADLE-OL acts as a prodrug."
