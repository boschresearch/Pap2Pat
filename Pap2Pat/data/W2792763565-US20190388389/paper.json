    "abstract": "Carnosol is a natural compound extracted from rosemary and sage, which has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer properties. In this report, we evaluated the therapeutic potential and elucidated the potential mechanism of action of carnosol in chemoprevention of ultraviolet B-light (UVB) induced non-melanoma skin cancer formation. Our data indicated that carnosol could partially reduce UVB-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and thus reduce DNA damage. It could also reduce UVB-induced formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CDP) in keratinocytes possibly through its ability in absorbing UVB radiation. In addition, carnosol could inhibit the UVB-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and also reduce UVB-induced transformation of keratinocytes. Taken together, the results indicate the role of carnosol as a potential chemopreventive agent upon UVB radiation.",

                "Carnosol is a natural compound extracted mainly from rosemary and sage, which are both common ingredients used in traditional Mediterranean cuisine1. Mediterranean diet and herbs are known to be associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular and diabetic diseases for decades2,3. Most recently, the identification and characterization of the anti-cancer properties of these herbs have received intensive interests4,5. Among all the compounds extracted from these herbs, carnosol (Fig.\u00a01), first isolated from sage in 1941, has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer properties6\u20138. Due to its structure similarity to sex hormones, carnosol has been shown to inhibit the growth of prostate and breast cancers by binding to estrogen and androgen receptors respectively9\u201313. However, no study has been done so far on the chemopreventive potential of carnosol on skin cancer upon Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. There are two reasons that carnosol can be a good candidate for chemoprevention of skin cancer formation: one is that it has an absorbance peak at 284\u2009nm14, which overlaps the wavelength of UVB, a well-known environmental carcinogen that causes various skin cancer15,16; and the other is that it has the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS)17, which is known to be involved in carcinogenic mechanisms upon UVB radiation18. In this study, we studied the functions of carnosol in regulating UVB-induced ROS elevation and DNA damage as well as cell carcinogenesis. We provided evidences that carnosol could potentially be a therapeutic agent for chemoprevention of UVB-induced skin cancers.Figure 1The chemical structure of carnosol."

                        "We first determined the effect of different doses of carnosol on intracellular ROS level in HaCaT cells with or without UVB radiation. Our data showed that carnosol treatment alone (0.1\u2009\u03bcM to 30\u2009\u03bcM) had no statistically significant effect on the background ROS level in cells. UVB (50\u2009mJ/cm2) radiation caused 2-fold ROS induction at 6\u2009hours after radiation (Fig.\u00a02A). Carnosol treatment at 0.1\u2009\u03bcM or 0.5\u2009\u03bcM had no statistically significantly change at ROS level post-UVB; however, ROS levels were decreased to approximately 1.5-fold by 10\u2009\u03bcM carnosol treatment and 1.3-fold by 20 or 30\u2009\u03bcM carnosol treatment. The results indicated that carnosol reduced UVB-induced ROS level in a dose-dependent manner. Since 30\u2009\u03bcM carnosol showed no further deduction on ROS level compared to 20\u2009\u03bcM, we used 20\u2009\u03bcM carnosol treatment for further analysis (Fig.\u00a02A).Figure 2Dose and time dependent effect of carnosol on UVB-induced intracellular ROS level.

We measured the ROS level at 20\u2009minutes intervals for 12\u2009h post UVB radiation. Our data indicated that carnosol treatment did not statistically significantly affect the ROS level in non-radiated cells, but it continuously reduced the ROS level in the irradiated cells from 20\u2009minutes to 10\u2009h after UVB radiation (Fig.\u00a02B).

We used phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) and Chk1 (p-Chk1) as two DNA breakage and damage markers20,21. In HaCaT cells, at early phase (15 and 60\u2009minutes) post UVB radiation, the phosphorylation levels of both H2AX and Chk1 was significantly reduced by carnosol treatment (Fig.\u00a03A). We further confirmed the DNA damage in cells using comet and immunofluoresent assays. In comet assay, the intensity of the comet tail was reduced by almost 50% comparing the cells treated with carnosol (20\u2009\u03bcM) and non-treated ones (Fig.\u00a03B). The immunofluorescent assay showed decreased level of p-Chk1 in the nucleus when treated with carnosol (20\u2009\u03bcM) in UVB irradiated HaCaT cells (Fig.\u00a03C). These results indicated that carnosol could at least partially protect the DNA breakage from UVB radiation.Figure 3Carnosol protects UVB-induced DNA damage.

To determine whether the formation of DNA lesions is also protected by carnosol, we quantitatively analyzed the UVB-induced formation of CPD and 6\u20134 PP for cells treated with or without carnosol. Our data demonstrated that UVB radiation increased CPD and 6\u20134 PP formations by 21.5-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively. Carnosol treatment could decrease UVB-induced CPD formation by approximately 50% to 11.8-fold (Fig.\u00a04A); while the treatment has no significant effect on UVB-induced 6\u20134 PP formation (Fig.\u00a04B).

Our data showed that carnosol could partially protect I\u03baB, the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, from UVB-induced reduction in a dose-dependent manner (1, 10, 20\u2009\u03bcM) (Fig.\u00a07A Lanes 6\u20138 vs. 5; Lanes 10\u201312 vs. 9). The protection lasted at least 6\u2009hours post-UVB radiation (Fig.\u00a07B). The increased levels of I\u03baB were correlated to a decreased phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB at S276 at 20\u2009\u03bcM concentration (Fig.\u00a07C, Lanes 5,6 vs. 4). The NF-\u03baB activity was further confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). By UVB alone, the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB increased about 20% at 2\u2009hours (Fig.\u00a07D Lane 5 vs. 1) and peaked to approximate 2.6-fold at 4 and 6\u2009hours (Fig.\u00a07D Lanes 6,7 vs. 1) post-UVB irradiation. While the treatment of carnosol (20\u2009\u03bcM) did not have a statistically significant effect at 2\u2009hours post-UVB irradiation (Fig.\u00a07D Lane 8 vs. 5), the treatment reduced the UVB-induced NF-\u03baB activity from its peak 2.6-fold to 2.2- and 1.5-fold at 4 and 6\u2009hours post-UVB irradiation respectively (Fig.\u00a07D, lane 9 vs. 6 and lane 10 vs. 7).

                "Overexposure to UVB leads to an increased chance of developing various forms of skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma15,16. Identification and characterization of natural compounds as chemopreventive agents for UVB-induced skin cancer formation is very appealing because these compounds are often safer and more environmentally friendly. In this study, we determined the efficacy of carnosol, a natural compound extracted from sage or rosemary, in protecting keratinocytes from UVB-induced DNA damage and transformation. Our results indicated that carnosol reduced skin cell transformation (Fig.\u00a05) possibly through the following mechanisms. First, carnosol protects DNA from UVB-induced breakage by reducing intracellular ROS level in the irradiated cells (Figs\u00a02 and 3). Second, carnosol reduces DNA lesion by reducing the formation of CPD (Fig.\u00a04A), but not 6\u20134 PP (Fig.\u00a04B)27. The selective reduction could be due to that the absorbance wavelength for forming cis-syn CPD is at 280\u2009nm28, which overlaps with the absorbance peak of carnosol in 284\u2009nm14; on the other hand, the absorbance wavelength to form 6\u20134 PP and its Dewar valence isomers is at 313\u2009nm28 which has no overlap with the absorbance of carnosol. This makes carnosol a good candidate for chemoprevention of UVB-induced skin cancer because (1) CPD is the predominant form of the dTpT dimers induced by UVB radiation (Fig.\u00a04, Panel A vs. B)30 and (2) the lasting UVB-induced mutation is caused by CPD but not 6\u20134 PP or oxidative DNA damage29. Moreover, carnosol inhibits UVB-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Fig.\u00a07), which is a pro-oncogenic factor26 elevated in skin cancer cells31. Thus, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity could potentially reduce the risk of cancer development after overexposure to UVB radiation. Carnosol, a polyphenol, may inhibit UVB-induced NF-\u03baB activation through NADPH oxidase (NOX)32, which is known to be activated by UVB and products superoxide (O2\u2022\u2212)33. We previously reported that the UVB-induced early activation of NF-\u03baB is dependent on constitutive nitric oxide synthases (cNOS) activation25. The nitric oxide (NO\u2022) produced from cNOS can quickly react with O2\u2022\u2212 to form peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which leads to PERK activation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, down regulation of I\u03baB synthesis and sequentially NF-\u03baB activation25,34\u201336. By inhibiting NOX and reducing the production superoxide (O2\u2022\u2212), carnosol could reduce the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), thus down regulate NF-\u03baB activation. Based on these results, carnosol shows the characteristics to be a chemopreventive agent upon UVB-induced skin cancer."
