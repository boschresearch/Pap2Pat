                                "The effect of different doses of carnosol on intracellular ROS level in HaCaT cells with or without UVB irradiation is demonstrated. The data show that 0.1 \u03bcM to 30 \u03bcM carnosol treatment alone had no statistic significant effect on the ROS level (FIG. 2, Control); and UVB (50 mJ/cm2) alone induced the ROS level by 2.1-fold at 6 h after the irradiation. The same treatment of carnosol reduced UVB-induced ROS level in a dose-dependent manner. The ROS level post-UVB was not statistically significantly changed with 0.1 \u03bcM or 0.5 \u03bcM carnosol treatment, while it was decreased to about 1.5-fold with 10 \u03bcM carnosol treatment and 1.3-fold with 20 or 30 \u03bcM carnosol treatment (FIG. 2. UVB). Since 30 \u03bcM carnosol showed no further deduction on ROS level compared to 20 \u03bcM, 20 \u03bcM carnosol treatment was used for further analysis.",
                                "After selecting the dose of carnosol, determined the extent of effect of carnosol on UVB-induced ROS elevation in a time dependent manner was determined. The ROS level at 20 min interval for up to 12 h post UVB radiation. The data show that carnosol treatment did not statistically significant affect the ROS level in untreated cells, but carnosol continuously reduces the ROS level in the irradiated cells from 20 mM to 10 h post-UVB (FIG. 3A). Taking a closer reading, carnosol decreased the ROS level from 20% immediately after UVB treatment to approximate 30% at 240, 480, and 720 mM after the radiation (FIG. 3B). These results show that carnosol selectively inhibits the induction of some ROS induced by UVB radiation.",
                                "Both NO* and ONOO\u2212 are induced by UVB radiation. By using DAF-2DA (5 mM) and DAR (5 mM), the effect of carnosol on intracellular NO* and ONOO\u2212 level, in a time dependent manner upon UVB radiation, was also measured.",
                                "Both NO* and ONOO\u2212 levels are increased upon UV radiation. With carnosol treatment, the data show that while carnosol had little effect on the NO; or ONOO\u2212 levels of cells without radiation, carnosol reduces both NO* and ONOO\u2212 level on average of about 40% from 2 h to 24 h post UVB radiation (FIG. 4).",

As shown herein, carnosol reduces the UVB-induced ROS elevation; further carnosol protects cells from UVB-caused DNA damage.",
                                "Both human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were used, and the protein levels of \u03b3H2AX and phosphor-Chk were used as DNA damage marker. In HaCaT cells, at early phase (15 mM and 1 h) post UVB radiation, the phosphorylation level of both H2AX and Chk was significantly reduced by carnosol treatment (FIG. 5A). Similar results are observed in MEF cells as both the phosphorylation level of H2AX and Chk reduced at early stage post UVB radiation (FIG. 5B). Similar results were confirmed by immunofluorescent assays which demonstrates that UVB radiation induces the expression level of p-Chk in nucleus, while carnosol treatment could significantly reduce the induction level (FIG. 5C). To further show the protection effect of carnosol on UVB-irradiated cell, a comet assay was performed. The data show that carnosol reduces the comet tail intensity almost by half upon UVB radiation (FIG. 5D). Thus, carnosol ast least partially protect the DNA damage from UVB radiation.",
                                "There are two major forms of DNA damage caused by UVB radiation: one is the direct DNA damage which forms CPD; the other is the oxidation-caused DNA damage, which causes the formation of 6-4 PP. In order to identify which form of DNA damage is protected by carnosol, a quantitative assay to identify the production of both DNA damage products after UVB radiation with or without carnosol treatment was performed. The data demonstrate that the formation of CPD was reduced by carnosol almost by half, while there is no significant reduction of 6-4 PP formation (FIG. 5E). The data show that carnosol protects cells from UVB-induced DNA damage by directly absorbing UVB energy (rather than reducing the oxidative stress on DNA damage, as previously believed).",

                                "As carnosol reduced intracellular ROS level and protected cells from UVB-induced DNA damage, it was then determined whether carnosol protects cell death upon UVB radiation. Both time and dose dependent assays were performed using HaCaT cells. In dose dependent assays (1-30 \u03bcM), there was no significant cell survival change with carnosol treatment alone (FIG. 6A, Lanes 2-5 vs. 1). With UVB radiation, carnosol had no statistically significant effect at 1 or 10 \u03bcM (FIG. 6A Lanes 7, 8 vs. 6); while at 20 \u03bcM carnosol treatment, cell survival rate was increased from 20% of UVB radiation alone to 30% (FIG. 6A Lane 9 vs. 5), with no further increasing at 30 \u03bcM carnosol treatment while there was limited toxicity of carnosol to the cells without UVB radiation (FIG. 6A Lane 10 vs. 5).",
                                "For the time dependent cell survival rate assay, at 6 h post UVB radiation, there was no significance with or without 20 \u03bcM carnosol treatment (FIG. 6B Lane 4 vs. 3); while at 12 h post UVB radiation, cell survival rate increased from 30% to 40% (FIG. 6B Lane 6 vs. 5), and at 24 h post UVB radiation, cell survival rate increased from 7% to 15% (FIG. 6B Lane 8 vs. 7), which shows that the protection of cell lasts at least up to 24 h post UVB radiation (FIG. 6B).",
                                "Similar results were also observed in MEF cells: the cell survival rate was increased from about 88% to 97% at 12 h (FIG. 6C Lane 4 vs. 3), 80% to 90% at 24 h (FIG. 6C Lane 6 vs. 5), 62% to 70% at 36 h (FIG. 6C Lane 8 vs. 7), 43% to 58% at 48 h, respectively (FIG. 6C Lane 10 vs. 9). Taken together, the data show that carnosol protects cells from UVB-induced cell death, mediated by protection of DNA damage and reduction of elevated ROS level.",

                                "As ROS may mediate the induction NF-\u03baB activity in UVB radiation, and carnosol reduces UVB-induced ROS level in cells, it was determined whether carnosol also affects the activity of NF-\u03baB. The effect of carnosol on I\u03baB protein level were determined in a time and dose dependent manner.",
                                "The data show that I\u03baB level was decreased upon UVB radiation alone (FIG. 7A Lanes 9, 5 vs. 1), and carnosol protects I\u03baB level at 2, 4 h post UVB radiation in a dose dependent manner (1, 10, 20 \u03bcM) (FIG. 7A Lanes 6-8 vs. 5; Lanes 10-12 vs. 9); and further, the protection exists at least until 6 h (FIG. 7B) in HaCaT cell. Similar results were also observed in MEF cells with the partial recovery of I\u03baB level when the cells were treated with carnosol (20 \u03bcM) (FIG. 7C). As the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB usually indicates its activity, the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB at Serine 276 (S276) site was detected. Correspondingly, the data also show that carnosol reduces the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB at 5276 at 20 \u03bcM concentration (FIG. 7D).",
                                "To further confirm the NF-\u03baB activity, EMSA assay was performed to test the binding activity of NF-\u03baB to its DNA target. Upon UVB radiation, NF-\u03baB activity induced by 20% at 2 h (FIG. 7E Lane 5 vs. 1), and peaked at about 2.6 fold at 4 and 6 h (FIG. 7E Lanes 6, 7 vs. 1). With the treatment of carnosol (20 \u03bcM), there was no statistically significant change at 2 h (FIG. 7E Lane 8 vs.5); however, the NF-\u03baB activity induction was significantly reduced at 4 and 6 h by reducing to 2.2 and 1.5 fold respectively (FIG. 7E Lanes 9, 10 vs. 5.6).

As only cancerous cells can survive in the soft-agar, by staining the survival cells with fluorescent dye, the cell transformation rate was determined. As shown in FIG. 8, UVB radiation alone could induce the cell transformation to up to about 3.5 fold, while treat the cells with carnosol could reduce it to about 2.2 fold. This reduction shows that carnosol protects normal cells to transform to cancerous cell upon UVB radiation.",

A431 human squamous carcinoma cell was used as it is one of the cancer types that keratinocyte would develop. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The data show that UVB alone could reduce the cell viability to about 50% in 24 h, compared to no treatment control; while treating the cells with carnosol further reduces the cell viability to 30%.",
                                "In addition, clonogenic assay was conducted to determine the progression rate of A431 cancer cell upon UVB radiation with or without carnosol treatment. With carnosol treatment alone, the colony formation rate decreased to about 65% (FIG. 9B Lane 2 vs. 1), while UVB radiation alone decreased the colony formation to about 43% (FIG. 9B Lane 3 vs. 1). With combined treatment of carnosol and UVB radiation, the colony formation was further decreased to about 17%. The data show that double treatment with carnosol and UVB radiation together leads to a synergistic effect on reduction of cancer cell survival (FIG. 9B).",

When carnosol is used as a chemoprevention or therapy for UV-induced skin cancer, it is now believed that the whole rosemary extract and rosemary powder will have the similar or even higher activity as carnosol does. Rosemary extract or powder may be more attractive to some consumers because they are total \u201cnatural products\u201d.
