    "title": "Noninvasive Deep Brain Stimulation via Temporally Interfering Electric Fields",
    "date": "2017-06-01",
    "abstract": "We report a noninvasive strategy for electrically stimulating neurons at depth. By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments, and verified that neurons in the living mouse brain could follow the electric field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice.",

                "Physical means of brain stimulation, such as the use of implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS), have led to widespread excitement about the possibility of repairing neural dysfunction through direct control of brain circuit dynamics, including multiple FDA-approved therapies for previously intractable brain disorders (Greenberg et\u00a0al., 2010, Kalia et\u00a0al., 2013). Electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes sparsely activates distributed sets of neurons (Histed et\u00a0al., 2009), in a fashion different from direct optogenetic control of local cells (Gradinaru et\u00a0al., 2009). The impact of electromagnetic stimulation on brain circuitry is an emergent function of the fields applied, the excitability properties of the neurons themselves, and the configuration of the neural network in which they are embedded (Merrill et\u00a0al., 2005). As a result of this complexity, physical means of brain stimulation are often used in a phenomenological way, especially because the excitability properties of neurons vary across different cell types, and thus understanding how a given brain stimulation method impacts a given brain function may require analyzing many factors.",
                "However, some properties of neurons are likely universal\u2014for example, the intrinsic low-pass filtering of electrical signals by\u00a0the neural membrane (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000), which prevents neural electrical activity from following very high-frequency oscillating (e.g., \u2265 1 kHz) electric fields. Here, we explore whether the biophysics underpinning such a potentially universal property might support novel strategies for electrical brain stimulation. In particular, if we apply high-frequency oscillating electric fields at multiple sites outside the brain, neurons in the brain will not be able to follow these high-frequency fields directly. However, if two such electric fields are applied at high frequencies that differ by a small amount, which corresponds to a low frequency that\u00a0neurons can follow, neurons in the brain may be able to demodulate and follow the envelope modulation that results from the temporal interference between these two applied fields, and which oscillates at the difference frequency. If the amplitude of the envelope modulation reaches a maximum at a site deep in the brain, it might be possible to drive deep-lying neurons without recruiting overlying ones. We here test this concept, which we call temporal interference (TI) stimulation, by using computational modeling and phantom measurements, as well as electrophysiological measurements in\u00a0vivo. We demonstrate the ability of TI stimulation to mediate activation of hippocampal neurons without recruiting overlying cortical neurons and steerably probe motor cortex functionality without physically moving electrodes by altering the current magnitudes delivered to a fixed set of electrodes."

                        "We first set out to examine whether the TI concept could indeed result in well-defined low-frequency envelope modulated electric fields. In the TI concept (Figure\u00a01A), electric currents are applied at high frequencies \\(f_{1}\\)  and \\(f_{2}\\) \u00a0= \\(f_{1} + \\Delta f\\ \\)  that fall outside the range of normal neural operation, but which differ by a small amount, \\(\\Delta f\\) , that falls within the frequency range that neurons can respond to. The superposition of the two electric fields inside the brain results in an electric field at a frequency of \\(\\left( {f_{1} + f_{2}} \\right)/2\\) , whose envelope is modulated at the frequency \\(\\Delta f\\)  (Figure\u00a01B). The amplitude of the envelope modulation at a particular location depends on the vectorial sum of the two applied field vectors at that point and as a result can have a maximum at a point distant from the electrodes, potentially even deep in the brain (Figure\u00a01C). The location of this envelope maximum depends on the electrode configuration, as well as properties of the applied waveforms. For the trapezoidal configuration shown in Figure\u00a01A, the low-frequency envelope oscillates at a frequency of 40\u00a0Hz, with waveforms in Figure\u00a01B plotted at the two specific points highlighted by Roman numerals in Figure\u00a01A. For example, Figure\u00a01Bi shows a large envelope modulation amplitude at a location where the two fields are large and aligned, whereas Figure\u00a01Bii shows a small envelope modulation amplitude at a location where the two fields are less aligned.Figure\u00a01Concept of TI Stimulation and Validation of Neural Activation in Intact Mouse Brain(A\u2013C) TI concept.(A) Electric field vectors \\({\\overline{E}}_{1}\\left( {x,y} \\right)\\)  and \\({\\overline{E}}_{2}\\left( {x,y} \\right)\\)  (gray and blue arrows respectively) resulting from alternating currents \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  simultaneously applied to the scalp of a simplified head model (simulated as a cylinder filled with saline). \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  are applied at kHz frequencies \\(f_{1}\\)  (1 mA at 1 kHz in this example, applied across the gray electrodes) and \\(f_{2}\\)  (1 mA at 1.04 kHz, across the blue electrodes) that are higher than the range of frequencies of normal neural operation, so that neurons are driven only at the difference frequency.

                        "To assess whether such low-frequency field envelopes could effectively drive neural spiking activity, we applied TI stimulation transcranially to anesthetized living mice, and recorded the responses by using automated whole-cell patch clamp neural recording. Currents were applied via two electrodes on the skull (with a \u223c0.5\u00a0mm gap between their edges), and recordings were made in the somatosensory cortex. We found that interferential stimulation with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting in a \\(\\Delta f\\)  envelope frequency of 10\u00a0Hz, was able to recruit neurons to fire at 10\u00a0Hz (Figure\u00a01D), as efficaciously as direct 10\u00a0Hz stimulation (Figure\u00a01E) that would be expected to broadly affect neural activity (Miranda et\u00a0al., 2013). High-frequency stimulation (with one sinusoid at 2 kHz and no TI) did not result in activity (Figure\u00a01F), beyond a brief transient associated with the beginning of stimulation in some cells (n\u00a0= 4 out of 6 cells from 2\u00a0mice) when 0.25\u00a0s sinusoidal ramp-up times were used. When 0.5\u00a0s ramp-up times were used, no such transient activity was observed in any cells (n\u00a0= 5 cells from 2 mice), suggesting that the transient spiking activity observed earlier was due to the speed of the 0.25\u00a0s duration ramp-up (Figure\u00a01J). We validated TI stimulation on a population of cortical cells (Figure\u00a01Ii) and found that interferential stimulation with a difference frequency of 10\u00a0Hz resulted in spike frequencies of 10.21 \u00b1 0.83\u00a0Hz (mean \u00b1 SD), for a 1 kHz carrier frequency (n\u00a0= 6 cells from 2 mice) and 9.68 \u00b1 0.85\u00a0Hz for a 2 kHz carrier frequency (n\u00a0= 7 cells from 3 mice; see Table S1 for full statistics associated with Figure\u00a01Ii).",
                        "To validate whether neuronal firing can be manipulated at different depths in tissue, we performed automatic patch clamp recording in the mouse hippocampus. Currents were applied via two electrodes that were located on the skull, with proximal edges 1.5\u20132\u00a0mm apart. We found that interferential stimulation (with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting in a \\(\\Delta f\\)  envelope frequency of 10\u00a0Hz) was able to recruit neural firing in synchronization with the envelope\u2014with either single spikes (n\u00a0= 3 cells from 2 mice) or brief bursts of spikes (n\u00a0= 5 cells from 3 mice; a burst was defined as a \\(<\\)  50\u00a0ms spiking event with inter-spike interval \\(\\leq\\)  15\u00a0ms; 1.3 \u00b1 0.37 mean spikes per burst \u00b1 SD; 9.07 \u00b1 3.2\u00a0ms inter-spike interval) elicited by the TI stimulation (in detail: mouse 1 had one cell with a burst response; mouse 2 had two cells with single spike responses; mouse 3 had two cells with a burst response; mouse 4 had two cells with a burst response and one cell with a single spike response) (Figure\u00a01G). Direct application of high-frequency stimulation (with two sinusoids on the two electrodes, both at 2 kHz) did not result in activity (Figure\u00a01H). No spiking transient was observed because we used the slower, 0.5\u00a0s duration ramp-up that we had previously observed to eliminate this transient (Figure\u00a01J; n\u00a0= 5 cells from 3 mice). We found (Figure\u00a01Iii) that interferential stimulation with a difference frequency of 10\u00a0Hz resulted in spike or burst occurrence frequencies of 10.23 \u00b1 0.61\u00a0Hz for a 2 kHz carrier frequency (n\u00a0=\u00a08 cells from 4 mice; see Table S1 for full statistics associated with Figure\u00a01Iii). The timing of the spikes or the first spikes of bursts, relative to the peak of the TI envelope, was \u22122.8 \u00b1 4.8\u00a0ms, i.e., when the envelope amplitude was >97% of its peak amplitude, which was not different from the timing of spikes evoked by 10\u00a0Hz stimulation relative to the 10\u00a0Hz sinusoid peak (\u22121.3 \u00b1 2.2\u00a0ms; pairwise t test, p\u00a0= 0.47).",

                        "To explore the effects of interferential stimulation at a physics level, we modeled the interferential electric field envelope magnitude as in Figure\u00a01A but for a variety of electrode configurations, and we also experimentally assessed these fields by using a tissue phantom comprising a plastic cylinder filled with saline (Figure S2). Current sources were isolated in the circuitry as described in\u00a0Figure\u00a0S3. We found that by altering the locations of the electrodes and by setting the currents appropriately, we could enable the interferential envelope modulation to be targeted to specific locations. For example, when the electrodes were arranged in a trapezoidal geometry as in Figure\u00a01A, but with a narrow base, we obtained, both in simulation and in the phantom, a peak of envelope modulation near the surface of the cylinder, at a\u00a0point in between the two electrodes (Figure\u00a02A), when both electrode pairs were conducting equal currents (1 mA in this example). By moving the electrodes that comprise the narrow base of the trapezoid further and further apart from each other, holding the currents constant, we could steer the location of\u00a0the peak envelope modulation deeper into the tissue (Figure\u00a02B), approaching the center of the cylinder as the trapezoid converged to a rectangle (Figure\u00a02C). The envelope locus (i.e., distance out to 1/e of the envelope maximum) in Figure\u00a02C was approximately two times larger, and the peak envelope amplitude ten times weaker, than in Figure\u00a02A (see Table 1 for numerical values associated with these three panels). Thus, it is possible to steer the envelope peak to have its maximum at essentially any depth throughout a volume, albeit with a tradeoff between the locus depth and its width and strength. Varying the locations of electrodes causes large changes in steering, with electrode size variation playing a more minor role (Figures S2A\u2013S2C). These analyses were conducted with a cylindrical phantom, but similar field distributions were obtained in simulations with a spherical phantom (Figures S2G\u2013S2L).Figure\u00a0S2Simulation of TI Fields in a Phantom, Related to Figure\u00a02An alternating current \\(I_{1}\\)  was applied to a phantom via one pair of surface electrodes (gray) at a \u223ckHz frequency, \\(f_{1}\\) .

The electrodes were electrically isolated. The spatial distributions of the electric fields \\({\\overline{E}}_{1}\\)  and \\({\\overline{E}}_{2}\\) , from currents \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  respectively, were simulated independently using a finite element method. The spatial distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude from the superposition of \\({\\overline{E}}_{1}\\)  and \\({\\overline{E}}_{2}\\)  was computed for a projection direction radial to the surface of the phantom, i.e., \\(\\left| {E_{AM\\widehat{r}}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right|\\) , and for a projection direction tangential to the surface of the phantom, i.e., \\(\\left| {E_{AM\\widehat{t}}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right|\\) , using \\(\\left| {{\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{AM}\\left( {\\overset{\\rightarrow}{n,}x,y} \\right)} \\right| = \\left| {\\left| {\\left( {{\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{1}\\left( {x,y} \\right) + {\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{2}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right) \\cdot \\overset{\\rightarrow}{n}} \\right| - \\left| {\\left( {{\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{1}\\left( {x,y} \\right) - {\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{2}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right) \\cdot \\overset{\\rightarrow}{n}} \\right|\\ } \\right|\\) , where \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{n}\\)  is a unit vector in radial or tangential direction. The maximal envelope amplitude \\(\\left| {E_{AM}^{max}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right|\\)  that was generated by the vector fields \\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{1}\\)  and \\({\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}}_{2}\\)  at locations \\(\\left( {x,y} \\right)\\)  across all directions was computed in post-processing as described in the STAR Methods.(A\u2013F) Cylindrical phantom model. The phantom model was a cylinder with a 50\u00a0mm diameter and 10\u00a0mm height that was filled with a saline solution (conductivity \\({0.333\\ S}/m\\) ).

The two pairs of electrodes (gray and black) were placed in an isosceles trapezoid geometry such that each electrode pair was located at the vertices of one lateral side. The trapezoid had a normalized small base size of a\u00a0= 0.39 and a normalized large base size of b\u00a0= 1.96 (geometry as in Figure\u00a02A).

To isolate the channels, each waveform was supplied via a balanced pair of current sources that were driven in precisely opposite phase, a technique that we call anti-phasic current drive.(A) Schematics of the electronic circuitry of the stimulator. (i) Dual channel stimulation with anti-phasic current drive isolation. In channel 1 \\(\\left( {CH_{1}} \\right)\\) , a voltage waveform \\(V_{1}\\)  at a frequency \\(f_{1}\\)  was applied to the positive (+) input of a voltage-controlled current source (J1) that had its negative (\u2212) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform \\(I_{1}\\)  at node 1A that was in-phase with waveform \\(V_{1}.\\)  An equal voltage waveform \\(V_{1}\\)  at a frequency \\(f_{1}\\)  was applied to the negative (\u2212) input of a second voltage-controlled current source (J2) that had its positive (+) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform \\(- I_{1}\\)  at node 1B that is anti-phase with waveform \\(V_{1}.\\)  In channel 2 \\(\\left( {CH_{2}} \\right)\\) , a second voltage waveform \\(V_{2}\\)  at a frequency \\(f_{2}\\)  was converted in an equivalent way to an in-phase current waveform \\(I_{2}\\)  at node 2A by a voltage-controlled current source (J3) and to an anti-phase current waveform \\(- I_{2}\\)  at node 2B by a voltage-controlled current source (J4). The amplitude of current \\(I_{1}\\)  of \\(CH_{1}\\)  between nodes 1A and 1B was calibrated such that \\(I_{1}(A) = \\left( {{V_{1}(V)\\ }/500} \\right)\\)  and the amplitude of current \\(I_{2}\\)  of CH2 between nodes 2A and 2B was calibrated such that \\(I_{2}(A) = \\left( {\\ {{V_{2}(V)}/500}} \\right)\\) . A ground or reference electrode (Ref) was provided to carry any imbalance currents from the paired current sources and to prevent charging of the body relative to earth ground. (ii) Dual channel stimulation without isolation. As in (i), but nodes 1B and 2B were connected to the GND of the device.(B) Characterization of channel isolation. (i) Schematic of the experiment setup. Voltage waveform \\(V_{1}\\)  of \\(CH_{1}\\)  was set to 1 kHz and 0.5\u00a0V resulting in a current \\(I_{1}\\)  between nodes 1A and 1B at the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load made of a bridge of 6 resistors with 1 k\u03a9 resistance each. Voltage waveform \\(V_{2}\\)  of \\(CH_{2}\\)  was set to 1.1 kHz and 0.5\u00a0V resulting in a current \\(I_{2}\\)  between nodes 2A and 2B at the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 2A and 2B were connected to the same resistor bridge load as shown in the schematics. The frequency spectrum of the currents was measured using a FFT spectrum analyzer (SR770, Stanford Research) at the output of \\(CH_{1}\\)  between nodes 1A and 1B, the output of \\(CH_{2}\\)  between nodes 2A and 2B, and across the resistor bridge between nodes 1A and 2B. (ii) Ratio of the FFT amplitude at the cross-talk frequency (i.e., \\(f_{2}\\)  at the output nodes 1A and 1B of \\(CH_{1}\\)  and \\(f_{1}\\)  at the output nodes 2A and 2B of \\(CH_{2}\\) ) and the FFT amplitude at the channel\u2019s set frequency (i.e., \\(f_{1}\\)  at the output nodes 1A and 1B of \\(CH_{1}\\)  and \\(f_{2}\\)  at the output nodes 2A and 2B of \\(CH_{2}\\) ). FFT ratio across \\(CH_{1} - CH_{2}\\)  between the output node 1A of \\(CH_{1}\\)  and the output node 2B of \\(CH_{2}\\)  is the ratio of the FFT amplitude of \\(f_{1}\\)  and the FFT amplitude of \\(f_{2}\\) . (The total harmonic distortion of the current source was\u00a0< 0.08% at 100\u00a0Hz and\u00a0< 0.4% at 10 kHz, measured with 9\u00a0harmonics on 1 k\u03a9 load resistor.)(C) Characterization of output current for different load resistances. Voltage waveform \\(V_{1}\\)  of \\(CH_{1}\\)  was set to \\(1\\ kHz\\)  and 0.5\u00a0V resulting in a current \\(I_{1}\\)  between nodes 1A and 1B of the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to loads with resistances between 100\u00a0\u03a9 and 100 k\u03a9. The output nodes 2A and 2B of \\(CH_{2}\\)  were grounded. The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows the amplitude of the measured currents \\(I_{measured}\\)  in mA against the load resistance in \u03a9.(D) Characterization of output current for different set frequencies. Voltage waveform \\(V_{1}\\)  of \\(CH_{1}\\)  was set to a range of frequencies between 0.1\u00a0Hz and 50 kHz with a range of amplitudes between 0.5\u00a0mV and 0.5 V, resulting in a current \\(I_{1}\\)  between 1A and 1B nodes of the same frequencies and with amplitudes that ranged between 1\u00a0\u03bcA and 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load with a resistance of 10 k\u03a9. The output nodes 2A and 2B of \\(CH_{2}\\)  were grounded. The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows 7 line plots of the RMS amplitude of the measured currents \\(I_{measured\\ {({RMS})}}\\)  in \u03bcA against the RMS amplitude of the current that was programmed in the device \\(I_{programmed\\ {({RMS})}}\\)  in \u03bcA, where \\(I_{programmed\\ {({RMS})}} = \\left( {I_{1}/\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\left( {{{V_{1}(V)}/{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 500}}\\ } \\right)\\) , for frequencies 0.1\u00a0Hz, 1\u00a0Hz, 10\u00a0Hz, 100\u00a0Hz, 1kHz, 10 kHz and 50 kHz. (Note that the line plots of frequencies between 0.1\u00a0Hz and 10 kHz are overlapping).(E and F) Effect of channel isolation on distribution of envelope amplitude. An alternating current \\(I_{1}\\)  was applied to a phantom at a frequency of 1 kHz via one pair of electrodes (gray). A second alternating current \\(I_{2}\\)  was applied to the phantom at a frequency of 1.02 kHz via a second pair of electrodes (black). The phantom was a non-conductive cylinder of 50\u00a0mm diameter and 10\u00a0mm height that was filled with a saline solution. The two pairs of electrodes (gray and black) were placed in an\u00a0isosceles trapezoid geometry such that each electrode pair was located at the vertices of one lateral side. The trapezoid had a normalized small base size of a\u00a0=\u00a01.39 and a normalized large base size of b\u00a0= 1.96. The amplitudes of currents \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  were 1 mA. The envelope modulation amplitude from temporal interference of two electric fields projected along the \\(\\widehat{x}\\)  and \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  directions was measured using a lock-in amplifier as in Figure\u00a02 (see also STAR Methods for a detailed description of the phantom measurement). Envelope modulation amplitude maps are a linear interpolation (interpolation factor 2) between the measured values. Color-maps show values normalized to maximal envelope modulation amplitude. Distances were normalized to the phantom\u2019s radius and are shown relative to the center of the phantom. High isolation is required between the two current sources in order to focus the region with large envelope modulation amplitude deep into the phantom.(E) Envelope modulation amplitude maps when currents were applied with a high level of electrical isolation between the current sources. (i) Envelope modulation amplitude map \\(\\left| {E_{AM\\widehat{x}}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right|\\)  along \\(\\widehat{x}\\)  direction; (ii) envelope modulation amplitude map \\(\\left| {E_{AM\\widehat{y}}\\left( {x,y} \\right)} \\right|\\)  (projection along \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  direction). Dashed lines cross at the peak of the envelope modulation amplitude distribution, i.e., \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|_{max}\\)  and \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|_{max}\\) . The volume of large envelope modulation amplitude was located along the midline of trapezoid at its small base with a peak at x\u00a0= 0 and y\u00a0= 0.49. The spread of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|\\)  around its peak has a normalized half width at half maximum along the \\(\\widehat{x}\\) \u00a0direction \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}} = 0.46\\)  and a normalized half width at half maximum along the \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  direction \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}} = 0.46\\) . The spread of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|\\)  around its peak is \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}} = 0.51\\)  and \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}} = 0.95\\) .(F) Same as (E) but when currents were applied without electrical isolation between the current sources. The peak of the envelope modulation amplitude was located along the midline of the trapezoid at its small base as in (E) however the distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude was significantly more dispersed. The amplitude of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|\\)  at the end of the \\(\\widehat{x}\\)  direction dashed line (normalized distance of 0.51 from center) was 0.76 of its maximal value. The spread of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|\\)  around its maximal value had a normalized \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}} = 0.95\\) . The amplitude of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|\\)  at the end of the \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  direction dashed line was 0.91 of its maximal value. The spread of \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|\\)  around its maximal value had a normalized \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}} = 0.83\\) .Figure\u00a02Steerability of TI, Probed via Both Computational Modeling and a Tissue PhantomFor each condition (A)\u2013(E), we simulated the interferential electric field envelope modulation (projected along: i, x-direction, ii, y-direction) that would result from electrodes at the locations indicated by the rectangles (the gray electrodes forming a pair, with an alternating current \\(I_{1}\\)  applied at 1 kHz, and the black electrodes forming a second pair, with an alternating current \\(I_{2}\\)  applied at 1.02 kHz), passing the currents described below in the individual panel caption sections. For exact coordinates of electrodes and numerical values of the peak envelope modulation amplitude, location, and width, see Table 1. We also experimentally measured in a tissue phantom (a non-conductive cylinder of 50\u00a0mm diameter and 10\u00a0mm height that was filled with a saline solution, with 1\u00a0mm diameter silver wire electrodes at various points around the perimeter of the phantom) these two amplitudes (iii, x-direction, iv, y-direction); channels were isolated as described in Figure\u00a0S3. Finally, we plotted, along line cuts through the simulated (lines) and experimental (dots) datasets, the interferential electric field envelope amplitudes for the x-direction (v) and the y-direction (vi). Simulated and experimental values along the vertical line cut were plotted in gray, and along the horizontal line cut, in black; values were normalized to the peak. Color-maps in i-iv are in V/m. Envelope modulation amplitude maps in iii and iv are a linear interpolation of the measured values. Distances in v and vi were normalized to the phantom\u2019s radius and shown relative to the center of the phantom. Circles in line plots v and vi are measured envelope modulation amplitudes without interpolation.(A) Electrodes were placed in a trapezoidal geometry with a narrow base, and amplitudes of currents \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  were set to 1 mA.(B) Electrodes were placed in a trapezoidal geometry with a wider base, with currents as in (A).(C) Electrodes were placed in a rectangle, with currents as in (A).(D) Electrodes as in (C), but now with currents in the ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2} = 1:2.5\\)  (holding the sum at 2 mA).(E) Electrodes as in (C), but now with currents in the ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2} = 1:4\\)  (holding the sum at 2 mA).Table 1Summary of Envelope Amplitude Attributes in Cylindrical PhantomFigure\u00a02 PanelElectrodes\u2019 TrapezoidCurrent Ratio (Gray to Black)Envelope Modulation Amplitude \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|_{max}\\) Envelope Modulation Amplitude \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|_{max}\\) Bottom BaseTop BasePeak (V/m) (Simulated, Measured)Normalized Peak Location (x,y)Normalized Half Width Half Maximum (\\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}},\\) \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}}\\) )Peak (V/m) (Simulated, Measured)Normalized Peak Location (x,y)Normalized Half Width Half Maximum (\\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}}\\) , \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}}\\) )A0.391.961:1(3.7, 1)(0, \u22121)(0.18, 0.1)(2.5, 1.1)(0, \u22120.77)(0.18, 0.37)B1.111.961:1(0.9, 0.75)(0, \u22120.87)(0.33, 0.25)(0.9, 0.7)(0, \u22120.37)(0.4, 0.52)C1.961.961:1(0.13, 0.15)(0, \u22120.59)(0.37, 0.42)(0.21, 0.23)(0, 0)(0.42, 0.49)D1.961.961:2.5(0.13, 0.14)(\u22120.2, \u22120.59)(0.37, 0.42)(0.2, 0.22)(\u22120.2, 0)(0.38, 0.4)E1.961.961:4(0.12, 0.13)(\u22120.35, 0)(0.36, 0.42)(0.19, 0.2)(\u22120.35, 0)(0.37, 0.34)Distances were normalized to the phantom\u2019s radius, with (0, 0) at the center of the phantom. \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{x}} \\right|_{max}\\)  and \\(\\left| E_{AM\\widehat{y}} \\right|_{max}\\)  are maximum values of the envelope modulation amplitude along \\(\\widehat{x}\\)  and \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  directions, respectively. \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{x}}\\)  and \\(HWHM_{\\widehat{y}}\\)  are normalized half width at half maximum along \\(\\widehat{x}\\)  and \\(\\widehat{y}\\)  directions, respectively.

                        "We next explored whether tuning the currents, while holding electrode locations constant, could be used to control the field envelope locus, and in particular to steer the envelope modulation peak away from the centroid of the electrode locations. We started by taking the electrode configuration of Figure\u00a02C, with its rectangular geometry, and adjusting the ratio of currents across the gray versus black electrodes from 1:1 to 1:2.5 (Figure\u00a02D) and 1:4 (Figure\u00a02E). We found that by changing the current ratio between the electrode pairs, while keeping the current sum fixed, the peak envelope modulation became increasingly close to the electrode pair with the lower current, with the peak moving 20% of the radius away from the center in the 1:2.5 case (Figure\u00a02D) and 35% of the radius away from the center in the 1:4 case (Figure\u00a02E). This suggests the possibility of \u201clive steering\u201d of activity from one deep site to another within the brain, without having to physically move the electrodes themselves. By having a larger number of electrodes on the scalp, and tuning the current frequencies and amplitudes appropriately, it may be possible to make the deep targeted stimulation volume smaller, as we computationally model in Figures S2M and S2N."

                        "We next aimed to stimulate a deep structure (i.e., mouse hippocampus) while not recruiting overlying structures (i.e., the cortex). We performed simulations like those we did before, but now for the mouse brain, and predicted that 10\u00a0Hz transcranial stimulation applied to sites at the surface of the skull (Figure\u00a0S4A) would broadly recruit neural activity throughout both superficial and deep structures. In contrast, performing TI stimulation with a 10\u00a0Hz difference frequency (Figure\u00a0S4B) would, in our models, result in a peak of 10\u00a0Hz envelope modulation at a deep site, with lower envelope modulation amplitudes in more superficial structures. Of course, such models make assumptions about brain electrical parameters and geometry that may vary from brain to brain (Peratta and Peratta 2010), possess limited spatial resolution (our anatomical mouse model had x, y, and z resolutions of\u00a042\u00a0\u03bcm, 42\u00a0\u03bcm, and 700\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively) and do not take into account differences in neural excitability across cell types and brain regions. Thus, to assess whether TI stimulation could indeed recruit activity in deep neural circuits without driving overlying ones, we compared 10\u00a0Hz versus TI stimulation in anesthetized mice, using the immediate early gene c-fos as a marker of neural activity, as has been used previously to gauge the focality of brain stimulation, since c-fos functions in the mouse cortex and hippocampus as an indicator of activated neurons (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015, Dragunow and Robertson, 1987, Reijmers et\u00a0al., 2007).Figure\u00a0S4Application of TI to Stimulation of Mouse Hippocampus, Related to Figure\u00a03(A) Quasi-electrostatic finite element method (FEM) mouse model simulation of 10\u00a0Hz and 2 kHz stimulations, corresponding to Figures 3A\u20133C and Figures 3D\u20133F, respectively.

                        "As expected, 10\u00a0Hz transcranial stimulation (10\u00a0s on then 10\u00a0s off, for 20\u00a0min) resulted in widespread c-fos expression (measured 90\u00a0min after stimulation) in both the cortex and in the hippocampus underlying the electrodes (Figures 3A and 3B), with 13.6% \u00b1 2.2% (mean \u00b1 SD used throughout) of cortical cells (as indicated by DAPI-stained nuclei) and 63.9% \u00b1 5.7% of hippocampal cells c-fos-positive underneath the electrodes (Figure\u00a03C). In contrast, there was essentially no c-fos activation on the contralateral side (see Table S2 for complete statistics for Figure\u00a03). Driving the brain with a 2 kHz transcranial current (with the same current magnitude and durations as in the 10\u00a0Hz case) resulted in essentially no c-fos positive cells (Figures 3D\u20133F), in either the cortex or the hippocampus, and on either the electrode-bearing or contralateral side. In contrast, when TI\u00a0stimulation was applied with frequencies of 2 kHz and 2.01\u00a0kHz (with the same current magnitude and duration as in the 10\u00a0Hz case), the hippocampus was strongly activated, Figures 3G and 3H, with c-fos in 53.12% \u00b1 14.5% of DAPI-labeled cells (Figure\u00a03I), not significantly different from that recruited by\u00a0the 10\u00a0Hz stimulation (Figure\u00a03C). But, despite the strong hippocampal recruitment, there was essentially zero c-fos in cortical cells\u2014both at a site between the stimulating electrodes where the cortical envelope modulation field would be anticipated to be at its highest value in the cortex, with c-fos in 0.48% \u00b1 0.47% of DAPI-labeled cells, and directly underneath an electrode, with c-fos in 0.32% \u00b1 0.29% of DAPI-labeled cells (Figure\u00a03I). Thus, TI stimulation can recruit neural activation in a\u00a0deep structure such as the hippocampus without recruiting the overlying cortex. As a control experiment, we separated the electrodes by a larger distance, which would be expected to reduce the envelope modulation field amplitude (Figure\u00a0S4C), and obtained no activation in the cortex or hippocampus (Figures S4D\u2013S4F).Figure\u00a03Application of TI to Stimulation of Mouse Hippocampus without Recruitment of Overlying Cortex(A) 10\u00a0Hz stimulation with anesthetized mice bearing two electrodes made of saline-filled tubes (1.5\u00a0mm outer diameter) placed on the skull surface (relative to\u00a0bregma: at anteroposterior (AP) \u22122\u00a0mm, mediolateral (ML) \u22120.25\u00a0mm, and AP \u22122\u00a0mm, ML 2.75\u00a0mm).

                        "We did not observe seizures during or after any of these stimulation paradigms (i.e., 10\u00a0Hz, 2 kHz, or TI stimulation). Furthermore, c-fos staining was always observed only on the ipsilateral side of stimulation, and not in other analyzed regions, including below the hippocampus or in the contralateral hippocampus, consistent with a local (as opposed to propagating) neural activity profile. The high c-fos expression observed in the dentate gyrus is consistent with c-fos expression patterns observed in rats after strong, unilateral electrical stimulation of the hippocampus via an implanted electrode in animals treated with carbamazepine, which prevents seizures and also prevents bilateral c-fos staining upon unilateral stimulation (Dragunow and Robertson, 1987)."

                        "To characterize the safety profile of TI stimulation, we immunohistochemically examined cellular and synaptic molecular profiles in the cortex and the hippocampus after unilateral TI stimulation (2 kHz and 2.01 kHz, 10\u00a0s on then 10\u00a0s off, for 20\u00a0min), as in Figures 3G\u20133I, but in awake, behaving mice. Mice were sacrificed and transcardially perfused after a 24\u00a0hr recovery period to allow for detection of persistent effects (e.g., caspase-3 activation) after a bout of stimulation. Brain sections were fluorescently stained with antibodies for the neuronal marker NeuN (Wolf et\u00a0al., 1996), the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 (D\u2019Amelio et\u00a0al., 2012), the DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX (Mah et\u00a0al., 2010), the microglial marker Iba1 (Ito et\u00a0al., 1998), the astrocyte marker GFAP (Eng et\u00a0al., 2000), and the synaptic protein synaptophysin (Syp) (Tarsa and Goda 2002). We compared fluorescence profiles in the brain regions that were stimulated (Stim+) with fluorescence profiles in the contralateral, non-stimulated hemisphere (Stim\u2212), as well as with fluorescence profiles in mice that underwent the same procedure but with current amplitudes set to 0\u00a0\u03bcA (Sham). We found that TI stimulation did not alter the neuronal density or affect the number of apoptotic cells (Figures 4A and 4B, Figures S5A and S5B, Figure\u00a0S5J) or induce DNA damage (Figures 4C and 4D, Figures S5C and S5D, Figure\u00a0S5K), at least as reflected by the stains above, relative to unstimulated or Sham stimulated brains. In addition, TI stimulation did not alter the intensity and density of Iba1 positive cells (Figures 4E and 4F, Figures S5G and S5H, Figure\u00a0S5M) or GFAP-positive cells (Figures S5N and S5O), suggesting a lack of reactive microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in response to TI stimulation. Finally, TI stimulation did not alter synaptophysin intensity, suggesting no changes to synapse density (Figures 4G and 4H, Figures S5E and S5F, Figure\u00a0S5L).

                        "We first established the motor threshold by systematically increasing the current sum \\(I_{1} + I_{2}\\)  in steps of 50\u00a0\u03bcA while keeping the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\)  fixed at \\(1:4\\) . We found that if \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  were applied with a carrier frequency of 2 kHz and a difference frequency of 10\u00a0Hz, the stimulation evoked a 10\u00a0Hz periodic movement of the contralateral forepaw with a motor threshold of 916 \u00b1 129\u00a0\u03bcA (Figure\u00a05B; mean \u00b1 SD, n\u00a0= 6 mice). If \\(I_{1}\\)  and \\(I_{2}\\)  were applied at the same frequency, no motor movement was observed (n\u00a0= 9 mice; assessed up to a current sum value of 2\u00a0mA). Changing the difference frequency between 1\u00a0Hz and 15\u00a0Hz changed the motion frequency accordingly, but not the\u00a0motor threshold (p\u00a0= 0.88; one-way ANOVA; n\u00a0= 6 mice; Figure\u00a05B and Movie S1; see Table S4 for full statistics associated with\u00a0Figure\u00a05B).\u00a0Increasing the carrier frequency from 1 kHz to 4\u00a0kHz linearly increased the motor threshold with a slope of 250\u00a0\u03bcA/kHz (linear regression, \\(R^{2} = 0.99\\) ; Figure\u00a05C and Movie S2; see Table S4 for full statistics associated with Figure\u00a05C); a 5 kHz carrier resulted in no response at the maximum current sum value tested (2 mA).",
                        "We next sought to test whether steering the site of stimulation by changing the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\) , as in our physics experiments (Figures 2C\u20132E), would shift the site of motor cortex activation. We changed the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\) , keeping \\(I_{1} + I_{2}\\)  fixed, and measured movements evoked in the forepaws, whiskers, and ears (see Movie S3 for representative video). We found that when \\(I_{1} < I_{2}\\)  (that is, stimulation was steered toward the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode), TI stimulation evoked a movement of the forepaw (Figure\u00a05Di, p\u00a0= 0.00004, Fisher\u2019s exact test, n\u00a0= 9 mice) and the whiskers (Figure\u00a05Ei, p\u00a0= 0.002, n\u00a0= 9 mice) contralateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode, but no movements ipsilateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode (Figures 5Di\u20135Fi; see Table S4 for full statistics associated with\u00a0Figures 5Di\u20135Fi). In contrast, when \\(I_{1} > I_{2}\\)  (stimulation was steered toward the \\(I_{2}\\)  electrode), TI stimulation evoked a movement of the whiskers (Figure\u00a05Ei, p\u00a0= 0.002, n\u00a0= 9 mice) and ear (Figure\u00a05Fi, p\u00a0= 0.03, n\u00a0= 9 mice) ipsilateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode but no movements contralateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode (Figures 5Di\u20135Fi).",
                        "The movement of the forepaw contralateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode was maximal when the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\)  was \\(1:8\\) , i.e., our condition in which stimulation was maximally steered toward the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode (1.24 \u00b1 0.36\u00a0mm, mean movement \u00b1 SD used throughout; p\u00a0= 0.000007, unpaired t test versus null hypothesis of no movement, thresholding at p\u00a0< 0.0025 Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons; n\u00a0= 9 mice) and gradually decreased as the current ratio increased (Figure\u00a05Dii). (Perhaps because the electrodes were not placed symmetrically, the movement of the forepaw ipsilateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode, though not statistically significant, showed an opposite pattern, with a maximal movement when the current ratio was \\(8:1\\) , i.e., when stimulation was maximally steered toward the \\(I_{2}\\)  electrode [Figure\u00a05Dii, 0.2 \u00b1 0.6\u00a0mm, p\u00a0= 0.35, n\u00a0= 9 mice].) The movement of the whiskers contralateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode was maximal when the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\)  was \\(1:4\\) , i.e., stimulation was partially steered toward the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode (0.4 \u00b1 0.41\u00a0mm, p\u00a0= 0.018, n\u00a0= 9 mice) and gradually decreased as the current ratio varied from this maximum (Figure\u00a05Eii; the 1:8\u00a0condition steers the stimulation more laterally than the 1:4 condition, which perhaps stimulated cortical regions more lateral to the whisker region [Tennant et\u00a0al., 2011], and thus elicited a lower whisker movement amplitude than that elicited by the 1:4 condition). In contrast, perhaps due to the asymmetrical location of our electrodes, the movement of the whisker ipsilateral to the \\(I_{1}\\)  electrode was maximal when the current ratio \\(I_{1}:I_{2}\\)  was \\(8:1\\) , i.e., stimulation was maximally steered toward the \\(I_{2}\\)  electrode (0.96 \u00b1 0.75\u00a0mm, p\u00a0= 0.0016, n\u00a0= 9 mice) and gradually decreased as the current ratio decreased (Figure\u00a05Eii). A similar trend was seen for the ears (Figure\u00a05Fii; see Table S4 for full statistics associated with Figures 5Dii\u20135Fii). Thus, TI stimulation can support steering of brain stimulation without physical electrode movement, resulting in tunable elicitation of movements."

                "In this paper, we present TI stimulation, validating the concept by using modeling as well as both physics and neurophysiology experiments, and demonstrate its utility by performing stimulation of a deep region (mouse hippocampus) without stimulating overlying neurons (cortex), as well as steerable brain stimulation of motor patterns without physical electrode movement. Future studies, perhaps using larger numbers of electrodes and multiple sets of interfering fields, may be able to pinpoint even smaller regions of the brain, or multiple regions of the brain. An open question is how small a focal volume may be achieved. At some point, inhomogeneities in the gray and white matter of the brain may cause difficulty in improving the resolution below that spatial scale, although MRI scans and data-driven sculpting of the electric fields may be able to compensate for this to some degree.",
                "How generalizable might be the effects observed here? There have been reports that strong kHz-frequency electric fields can block the propagation of compound action potentials in peripheral nerves (Cuellar et\u00a0al., 2013, Kilgore and Bhadra, 2014). Such effects were localized to the immediate vicinity of the electrodes, leaving regions a few millimeters away, perhaps where the magnitude of the fields was lower, unaffected. The magnitude of the fields used in our study to transcranially recruit neural activity in the brain were perhaps one to two orders of magnitude weaker than in these earlier studies, so we anticipate that such effects may have been minimal in our study. This is consistent with our repeatable observation of a lack of physiological effect of 2\u00a0kHz electric fields on brain activity. However, future studies might seek to explore how stronger kHz-frequency electric fields affect the brain. Such data might also present an upper limit to the field strengths applicable for TI stimulation. There has been a report of kHz-frequency transcranial electric field stimulation (1\u20135 kHz) that resulted in neural plasticity similar to that resulting from anodal DC stimulation (Chaieb et\u00a0al., 2011), but a later report found that 5 kHz transcranial electric fields, grouped in theta burst patterns, did not result in neural plasticity (Kunz et\u00a0al., 2017). In our current dataset, we did not observe effects of kHz-frequency electric fields beyond a brief transient that was observed when short ramp-up times were used (but not with longer ramp-up times), both suggesting that, in studies using kHz-frequency fields, subtle parameters of the stimulation may help determine exactly what effects on neural activity result and presenting an area for future exploration. We found that TI stimulation at amplitudes sufficient to recruit deep brain structures, such as the hippocampus, did not alter the neuronal and synaptic integrity of the underlying tissue 24\u00a0hr after stimulation, at least as reflected by the stains we used. Additional time points other than 24\u00a0hr post stimulation may provide, in the future, a more detailed picture of the safety of TI stimulation. Furthermore, the safety profile of TI stimulation associated with evoked behavior patterns, such as those utilized here, should be explored in the future.",
                "Given the remarkable therapeutic benefits of DBS for patients with otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective disorders (Kringelbach et\u00a0al., 2007), the prospects for noninvasive DBS using electricity are potentially exciting. Other methods for noninvasive DBS have been proposed, e.g., using transcranial ultrasound (Legon et\u00a0al., 2014) or using expression of heat-sensitive receptors and injection of thermomagnetic nanoparticles (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015), but the unknown mechanism of action (Plaksin et\u00a0al., 2014) and the need to genetically manipulate the brain, respectively, may limit their immediate use in humans. TI\u00a0stimulation may thus represent a practical strategy for noninvasively stimulating neurons deep in the brain. It uses familiar and well-tested electric fields (Stavroulakis, 2014, International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, 2010) and does not require chemical or genetic manipulation of the brain. We anticipate that it might rapidly be deployable into human clinical trials, as well as studies of the human brain."

                                "The kHz currents were generated using a custom made device consisting of two electrically isolated current sources. To isolate the channels, each waveform was supplied via a balanced pair of current sources that were driven in precisely opposite phase with a ground electrode carrying any imbalance currents (< 1%) from the paired current sources, preventing charging of the body relative to earth ground (Figure\u00a0S3A). Each current source reliably drove 2 mA of current on 1 k\u03a9 loads up to a frequency of 10 kHz with a resolution of 0.02Hz (Figures S3C and S3D). At load resistances higher than 10 k\u03a9 the current source eventually saturated. The current output had a leakage level\u00a0< 0.1\u00a0\u03bcA root mean square (RMS) at 100 kHz bandwidth, measured on a 1 k\u03a9 load resistor with a differential amplifier (7A22, Tektronix). The total harmonic distortion of the current source was\u00a0< 0.08% at 100\u00a0Hz and\u00a0< 0.4% at 10 kHz (measured with 9 harmonics on a 1 k\u03a9 load resistor). The total harmonic distortion and frequency cross-talk were measured using an FFT spectrum analyzer (SR770, Stanford Research). When the two current sources were applied to a common conductive load, e.g., a resistive bridge (Figure\u00a0S3B) or a saline bath (Figure\u00a0S3E), the cross-talk at the terminals of each channel was\u00a0< 0.1%, allowing almost 100% of the interference to build up inside the load. In comparison, without the anti-phasic drive, approximately 30% cross-talk was measured at both the channel terminals and inside the conductive medium (Figure\u00a0S3B, Figure\u00a0S3F)."

To reduce stimulation artifacts for spike identification, traces were filtered using a 5th order Butterworth band-stop filter with cutoff frequencies of 1 kHz and 15 kHz and then with a 3rd order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100\u00a0Hz (representative traces from the cortex are shown in the Supplemental Materials without filtering and after filtering with only the band-stop filter; representative traces from the hippocampus are shown after filtering with only the band-stop filter). Single spikes were identified using a running window average that picked out depolarizations of > 40\u00a0mV above baseline, which were \u201cpeaky\u201d (that is, exhibited amplitudes larger than the average amplitudes of the nearest 3 data points before and after, by\u00a0>\u00a00.001\u00a0mV). Consecutive spikes with inter-spike interval \\(\\leq\\)  15\u00a0ms, which occurred during a period of 50\u00a0ms or less, were defined as a spiking burst. Mean spiking frequency during stimulation periods (not including the ramping periods) was computed for each stimulation block and then averaged across neurons for each stimulation condition. Mean spontaneous firing rate was computed by a similar averaging of the firing rates across neurons, but for the 1\u00a0s interval before stimulation began. In the case of control 1\u00a0kHz or 2 kHz stimulation with no TI, we analyzed data from all complete blocks. Mean membrane potential was computed for a 500\u00a0ms period before the onset of 2 kHz or 1 kHz stimulation and was compared with a similar 500\u00a0ms period 1\u00a0s after stimulation onset, by dividing each period to 10 equally sized epochs and averaging across epochs. Overall, 18 neurons from 8 mice were analyzed with a minimal and maximal number of neurons per mouse of 1 and 4, respectively."

The simulation solved the equation \\(\\nabla\\sigma\\nabla\\phi = 0\\) , where \\(\\sigma\\)  is the local electrical conductivity and \\(\\phi\\)  is the electric potential from which the electric field and the current density can be obtained as \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{E} = - \\nabla\\phi\\)  and \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{j} = \\sigma \\cdot \\overset{\\rightarrow}{E}\\)  respectively. The solver is suitable for the frequencies used in this paper, as displacement currents can be neglected compared to ohmic ones. The solver discretizes the model using adaptive, rectilinear meshes. Tissue properties have been assigned according to the IT\u2019IS Foundation database of tissue properties (Hasgall et\u00a0al., 2015). The same conductivity values were used at all frequencies. The stimulating currents were normalized by integrating the normal current density over a surface surrounding an electrode.
