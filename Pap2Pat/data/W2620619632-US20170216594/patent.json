    "abstract": "In illustrative implementations of this invention, interferential stimulation is precisely directed to arbitrary regions in a brain. The target region is not limited to the area immediately beneath the electrodes, but may be any superficial, mid-depth or deep brain structure. Targeting is achieved by positioning the region of maximum envelope amplitude so that it is located at the targeted tissue. Leakage between current channels is greatly reduced by making at least one of the current channels anti-phasic: that is, the electrode pair of at least one of the current channels has a phase difference between the two electrodes that is substantially equal to 180 degrees. Pairs of stimulating electrodes are positioned side-by-side, rather than in a conventional crisscross pattern, and thus produce only one region of maximum envelope amplitude. Typically, current sources are used to drive the interferential currents.",

                        "In illustrative implementations of this invention, interferential stimulation is precisely directed to arbitrary regions in a brain. The region targeted is not limited to the area immediately beneath the electrodes, but may be any superficial, mid-depth or deep brain structure. For example, in some use scenarios of this invention, interferential stimulation is precisely targeted at a deep brain structure, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, or hippocampus. In other use scenarios, interferential stimulation is precisely targeted on a superficial or mid-depth region of the cortex. In yet other use scenarios, interferential stimulation is precisely targeted on both a superficial brain structure and deep brain structure simultaneously.",
                        "Conventional interferential current (IFC) devices and methods are not able to achieve this targeting, because they suffer from at least four flaws:",
                        "First, targeting by conventional IFC is based on a misconception: It is erroneously believed that maximum cell response occurs in regions where the modulation index of the amplitude-modulated (AM) waveform approaches 100%. In other words, the misconception is that the greater the interference between the two original waveforms that create the AM waveform, the better the interferential therapy works. Thus, based on this misconception, conventional IFC tries to position the region of maximum interference (i.e., where the amplitudes of the two original waveforms that form the AM wave are closest to being equal) at the tissue structure that is the target of the attempted stimulation.",
                        "This belief is incorrect. In fact, the maximum cell response to interferential stimulation occurs in the region where the envelope amplitude (as defined herein) of the AM waveform is greatest. The region where the envelope amplitude is greatest does not necessarily coincide with the region of maximum interference, and is often quite different. Examples of envelope amplitude EAM are shown in FIGS. 1A, 1C and 1D.",
                        "Second, conventional IFC suffers from significant current leakage between the two current channels that create the interferential effect. An IFC device typically uses two pairs of stimulating electrodes. Each electrode pair is a current channel that creates an electric field. The interference of the two electric fields produces the AM waveform that stimulates cells in interferential therapy. Unfortunately, in conventional IFC, substantial current leakage occurs between the two channels\u2014for example, in some cases, 20% or more of the current across one electrode pair is due to the electric waveform created by the other electrode pair. This crosstalk between current channels may cause the spatial position of interference regions to shift in an undesirable or uncontrolled way. For example, because current from one electrode pair is flowing into the other electrode pair, cell stimulation due to an AM waveform may occur very near the electrodes, even if stimulation is desired to occur at a position remote from the electrodes. This leakage between currents occurs because both pairs of electrodes are electrically connected to the same conductive load\u2014the tissue of the subject being stimulated. In some existing IFCs, transformers have been used to isolate currents. However, transformers tend to be bulky.",
                        "Third, in conventional IFC, electrode placement is limited. In conventional IFC, the four stimulating electrodes are positioned in a crisscross pattern, in which each electrode is located at a corner of a rectangle (typically, a square). Thus, the line segment that joins the electrodes of one electrode pair is one diagonal of the rectangle, and the line segment that joins the electrodes of the other electrode pair is the other diagonal of the rectangle. These two diagonals cross each other, forming an X (crisscross) pattern. The electrodes are positioned so that the target tissue region is located at, or beneath, the center of the rectangle where the two crisscrossing diagonals intersect. This crisscross pattern is consistent with (and perhaps was originally motivated by) the misconception described above: in this configuration, the region of maximum interference typically would occur (absent the spatial inaccuracies caused by current leakage) at the center of the rectangle where the two diagonals intersect. Unfortunately, this conventional electrode placement is not suited for targeting some tissue regions, such as deep brain structures remote from the stimulating electrodes. For example, it is typically impossible to position electrodes on the skin in a rectangular pattern such that the hypothalamus (a deep brain structure) is located at the center of the rectangle.",
                        "Fourth, in many conventional IFC devices, voltage sources are used to drive the current channels. Unfortunately, the amount of current delivered by a voltage source depends on the impedance of the electrical load. This problem is exacerbated where the conductive load is a brain, because impedance varies widely in different brain structures, making it difficult to deliver a precisely regulated current amount with voltage sources. This in turn makes it difficult to precisely control the spatial position of the interferential stimulus in the brain.",
                        "In illustrative embodiments of this invention, a novel interferential stimulation technology overcomes these four hurdles as follows:",
                        "First, in illustrative embodiments, targeting is based on achieving a desired envelope amplitude at targeted tissue locations. For example, in some cases, the region of maximum envelope amplitude is positioned at the specific brain structure being targeted. Or, for example, a larger region may be targeted, and the interference tuned such that the envelope amplitude is simultaneously above a certain threshold in all parts of the targeted region.",
                        "Second, in illustrative embodiments, currents are isolated by making at least one of the current channels anti-phasic: that is, the electrode pair of at least one of the current channels has a phase difference between the two electrodes that is substantially equal to 180 degrees. This dramatically reduces current leakage between the two current channels. For example, in a prototype of this invention, current leakage between the two current channels has been reduced such that only 4% of the current across one electrode pair is due to the electric field created by the other current channel. Thus in illustrative embodiments, the anti-phasic current channel(s) greatly ameliorate current leakage, which in turn allows the interferential device to more precisely position the region in which the envelope amplitude is at a desired magnitude.",
                        "Third, in illustrative embodiments, stimulating electrodes are positioned in a wide variety of spatial configurations, including positions in which the electrodes are not in rectangular (or square) configuration. For example, in some embodiments of this invention: (a) the stimulating electrodes are positioned in a semicircle, or circle, or line; or (b) the stimulating electrodes are positioned such that the distance between electrodes of one electrode pair (current channel) is different than the distance between electrodes of the other electrode pair (current channel) or is different than the distance between the two electrode pairs; or (c) the stimulating electrodes are positioned side-by-side, rather than in a crisscross pattern. Thus, in illustrative embodiments, the positioning of electrodes is adaptable to the structure being stimulated, and may be selected so as to control the spatial position of regions in which the envelope amplitude is above a given threshold.",
                        "Fourth, in illustrative embodiments, current sources are used to drive the interferential currents, rather than voltage sources. An advantage of a current source is that the current delivered does not, within the source's compliance voltage range, depend on the impedance of the load. Thus, the amount of current can be precisely controlled, despite the anistropic impedance of the brain. This, in turn, facilitates precise interferential targeting, because the spatial position of a region with a given envelope amplitude depends in part on the magnitude of the currents in the two interferential current channels.",
                        "This invention is not limited to stimulation of the brain, but has practical advantages in a wide variety of use cases. Among other things, in illustrative embodiments of this invention, interferential stimulation may be precisely targeted at any deep or superficial region of the body. For example, in some use scenarios of this invention, interferential stimulation is targeted at particular regions of the heart, or at the pineal gland deep inside the cranium, or at the spinal cord or other nerves, or at the digestive tract, or at reproductive tissue, or at a muscle.",
                        "This invention is not limited to interferential stimulation. Among other things, current isolation using an anti-phasic current channel may be employed to simultaneously deliver stimulation at different frequencies to different tissue regions, in such a manner that the tissue responds to the original waveforms, and not to the AM waveform created by interference.",
                        "The description of the present invention in the Summary and Abstract sections hereof is just a summary. It is intended only to give a general introduction to some illustrative implementations of this invention. It does not describe all of the details and variations of this invention. Likewise, the descriptions of this invention in the Field of Technology section and Field Of Endeavor section are not limiting; instead they each identify, in a general, non-exclusive manner, a technology to which exemplary implementations of this invention generally relate. Likewise, the Title of this document does not limit the invention in any way; instead the Title is merely a general, non-exclusive way of referring to this invention.

In FIG. 1A, two current channels produce two original waveforms: channel 1 produces original waveform 111 and channel 2 produces original waveform 112. The amplitude of the first waveform 111 is Ech1; and the amplitude of the second waveform 112 is Ech2. The AM index is the ratio of these two amplitudes: AM index=Ech1/Ech2. Interference of the two original waveforms 111, 112 produces an amplitude-modulated (AM) waveform 114. The AM waveform has an envelope 115. The top of the envelope is a signal. The peak amplitude of that signal is the envelope amplitude EAM.",
                                "In illustrative embodiments of this invention, targeting is based on the envelope amplitude instead of the AM index. Specifically, in illustrative embodiments, targeting is based on controlling the spatial position of a region where the envelope amplitude is above a threshold or is at a maximum. This is different than conventional IFC, in which targeting attempts to control the spatial position of a region where the AM index is above a threshold or is at a maximum.",
                                "This distinction is important, because the region of maximum envelope amplitude does not necessarily coincide with the region of maximum interference, and is often quite different.",

The two pairs of electrodes are electrically connected to a common conductive load 125 (such as a brain). Arrows 126 and 127 represent the current from the first and second current channels, respectively, flowing in the conductive load 125. The arrows are merely symbolic\u2014among other things, each current actually alternates in direction and flows through all regions of the conductive load.",

In illustrative embodiments of this invention, these factors are adjusted to precisely position this region at the targeted tissue. For example, in some use scenarios of this invention involving interferential stimulation, transcranial electrodes create electric fields in a brain such that: (i) an interferential zone is created close to one or more of the electrodes at a superficial depth in the brain (e.g. in the cortex); (ii) an interferential zone is created at a deeper depth of the brain but laterally close to the electrodes; or (iii) an interferential zone is created at any brain depth in a region that it is remote from the electrodes.

In typical use scenarios in which it is desired to provide interferential stimulation to only a single targeted location, the extra regions of maximum envelope amplitude are not desirable, since they stimulate at least one additional tissue region that is not an intended target. (Of course, if one is under the conventional misconception that the region of maximum interference\u2014rather than the region of maximum envelope amplitude\u2014should be positioned at the targeted tissue, this drawback is not apparent. The region of maximum interference typically occurs at the center of the conventional rectangular configuration where the crisscross intersects).",

In the examples shown in FIGS. 1E to IL, only one region 180 of maximum envelope amplitude occurs. This is advantageous, because in typical use scenarios, only one tissue is being targeted at a time, and thus it is advantageous to produce only one region of maximum envelope amplitude at time. The response of neurons (or other excitable cells) to the interferential stimulation is greatest where the envelope amplitude is greatest (at least, for amplitudes within the safe operating ranges of an interferential device treating a human).",
                                "A reason that only one region 180 of maximum envelope amplitude is produced in FIGS. 1F to IL is that the pairs of electrodes are positioned side-by-side, rather than in a crisscross configuration.

If the pulse durations are significantly longer than the time constant of the neuron (typically \u02dc1 ms), a reduction in the pulse duration results in a small linear increase in the threshold. However, if the pulse durations are equal or smaller than the neuron time constant, a reduction in the pulse duration results in a large exponential increase in the threshold. This principle is known as the strength-duration response of neurons.",

In this case, the electric field peak amplitude needed to evoke a train of action potentials depends on the pulse duration and on the inter-pulse-interval since the neural membrane requires time to recover from an action potential event. (An incomplete recovery of the neural membrane potential results in a larger activation threshold).",

The actual rate of action potentials in this case may be significantly lower than the frequency of the electric field. Furthermore, if the electric field frequency is further increased eventually the neuron will remain depolarized to a level that suppresses any spiking activity.",
                                "A different response pattern emerges when the amplitude of the electric field pulse is lower than the threshold amplitude to evoke an action potential, i.e. sub-threshold. In this case, while a single pulse evokes only sub-threshold depolarization, if the inter-pulse interval is sufficiently small, a train of electric field pulses may be summed (or integrated) by the neuron to evoke supra-threshold, i.e. action potential, event. Thus, the neuron's response may comprise supra-threshold temporal summation, as defined herein. The amplitude that evokes a single action potential via supra-threshold temporal summation of sub-threshold pulses depends on the pulse duration and on the inter-pulse interval (the shorter the electric field inter-pulse interval the better it is summed up by the neuron). The efficiency of the temporal summation of the neuron is determined by its re-polarization rate, i.e. the rate by which the membrane returns to its rest potential value following an electrical stimulation.",
                                "If the electric field train is symmetrical or bio-phasic such as sinusoidal, the neural frequency response has a complex behavior as higher frequencies result in shorter pulse duration (i.e. higher threshold due to strength-duration response) but also shorter inter-pulse-interval (lower threshold due to stronger temporal summation). Overall, the frequency of the sub-threshold electric field must be larger than the natural frequency band to allow sufficient temporal summation.",
                                "A continuous train of sub-threshold electric field pulses may evoke a single action potential, via supra-threshold temporal summation, but typically does not evoke a stable time-locked train of action potentials as there is no stimulation free time for the neuron to repolarize after an action potential event. Typically, in this case, after the first action potentials, the neuron effectively stops to respond to the electric field and enters a steady-state in which its membrane is slightly depolarized above its rest potential and can respond to internal or external supra-threshold stimuli. (n some circumstances, there maybe be a narrow amplitude-frequency range in which action potential oscillation occurs.)",

The two currents interfere with other to produce an amplitude-modulated waveform.

In conventional current drive techniques, current from one channel is diverted toward the return path of the second channel leading to a strong amplitude modulation at the electrodes themselves. In the case of conventional interferential stimulation, this may result in the appearance of a beat frequency near the electrodes and not inside the tissue.",
                                "In illustrative implementations of this invention, this problem (of current leakage) is solved by using a current drive that is anti-phasic or that includes an isolation transformer.

In some cases, an isolated current drive provides isolated and localized stimulation of two or more areas of a tissue. For example, in some use scenarios, one segment of a neural tissue is stimulated with one waveform (e.g. 10 Hz) and another nearby segment of the same neural tissue is stimulated with the same or different waveform (e.g. 20 Hz or DC) without interference currents. The neural segments may be a few micrometers or millimeters apart as in the case of an invasive stimulator with multiple electrodes or a few centimeters apart as in the case of noninvasive stimulator.",
                                "In illustrative implementations of this invention, an isolated current drive is implemented either with an anti-phasic source or with an isolation transformer.",
                                "Anti-phasic Source: In the anti-phasic case, a current source drives two different electric waveforms through balanced pairs of electrodes, one waveform through a first pair of electrodes and a second waveform through a second pair of electrodes. At least one electrode pair is anti-phasic, that is, the phase at the first electrode of the pair is substantially anti-phasic (substantially 180 degrees out-of-phase) from the phase at the second electrode of the pair. In some cases, only one of the electrode pairs is anti-phasic. In other cases, both of the two electrode pairs is anti-phasic. In some cases, a ground or reference electrode is provided to carry any imbalance currents from the paired currents sources and to prevent charge up of the body relative to earth ground. The vast majority (>99%) of the stimulation current created by each electrode pair does not flow through this ground or reference electrode since the current is driven differentially or out of phase with each other. A benefit of this approach is that most of the current is not going through the common ground electrodes. This allows multiple current waveforms to flow independently inside the tissue. This eliminates (or greatly reduces) crosstalk between the channels and permits triangulation of the currents through the conductive medium away from the path of current to the ground.",
                                "Isolation Transformer: In the isolation transformer case, two current waveforms are isolated from each other by connecting the primary wires of a transformer to a single current source and a ground and connecting the floating secondary wires of the transformer to two or more stimulating electrodes. This configuration greatly reduces cross-talk between the two channels, and thus has a similar effect as an anti-phasic drive. In some cases, a ground or reference electrode is provided to prevent charge up of the body due to static electrical sources from the environment. In some cases, a conventional current source with a ground return electrode creates one stimulus waveform and all other electrodes are isolated by transformers.",
                                "Thus, in illustrative implementations of this invention, the two currents are isolated from each other, even though the currents are flowing simultaneously through a single conductive medium.

Steering the position of the interferential region in this way is sometimes called \u201cvector rotation\u201d, because it changes the position vector of the interferential region. In some prior art: (a) the amplitude of one of the original waveforms is increased while the amplitude of the other original waveform is simultaneously decreased, and (b) such reciprocal, simultaneous vector rotation is sometimes called anti-phasic. However, so-called anti-phasic vector rotation is quite different than an anti-phasic current drive of the present invention.
