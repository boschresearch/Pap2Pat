    "abstract": "Inter-strip shortening due to electron accumulation is a problem for any segmented p-type and double-sided n-type detectors. The standard approach for inter-strip or interpixel isolation is an implanted and annealed p-type layer, called p-stop. We show that alumina layer can be used as effective p-stops due to a negative surface charge at the silicon-alumina interface. We used ALD (atomic layer deposition) and e-beam evaporated alumina layers as inter-strip dielectrics for n-on-n strips. We fabricated a double sided strip detector (DSSD) on n-type silicon with alumina as a p-stop and tested the DSSD under gamma-ray irradiation. We compare ALD alumina layers with standard silicon oxide for isolating n-on-n strips. Equivalents to \u201cp-stop\u201d and \u201cp-spray\u201d were fabricated and evaluated with respect to their leakage currents. Finite element simulations support our experimental findings.",

                "T HE most common insulator for silicon based radiation detectors is silicon-oxide, Si0 2 \u2022 The interface between a Si0 2 layer and the bulk silicon develops a layer of fixed charge. This charge, which is present to some degree even prior to irradiation, is normally positive. The presence of this layer induces an inversion layer of the opposite charge (called an accumulation layer in the case of electrons) which remains permanently attracted to it from the bulk. The accumulation layer can compromise the isolation of implants on the n-side of strip and pixel devices unless special isolation features are implemented. The electron accumulation can ultimately short the n-implants. The most common techniques to maintain implant isolation are: p-stop [1] and p-spray [2] techniques, see Fig.",
                "(1). P-stops are implanted p + channels between neighboring n-implants. A p-spray layer is a shallow p-type implant that is applied across the full wafer without mask prior to any other processing. The dopant concentration of the implant is matched to the interface charge. However, the p sprays and p-stops have the drawback of adding a mask level to the fabrication process that increases its complexity and cost. Furthermore, the high electric fields at the edge of the p stops have been shown to induce pre-breakdown micro discharges which decrease the signal-to-noise ratio [3].",
                "In this paper we show that it is possible to replace the silicon oxide with an ALD (atomic layer deposition) alumina, Ah03 layer. Properly treated Ah03 layers can form negative charges at the silicon interface with densities of \ufffd _lOll to -  "

                        "Fig. (2) shows a schematic of an alumina layer as an effective p-stop. Since there is a negative interface charge present at silicon-alumina interface, no electron accumulation can form underneath the interstrip dielectric. The alumina can be deposited using ALD during regular sensor fabrication or in \"post-processing\" because ALD is a low-temperature process. The existence of negative fixed charge between Al 2 03 and Si interface is caused by the negatively charged AI ions with a tetrahedral coordination contacting to the silicon atoms of the interface [5]. The interface charge density depends on the deposition method for the alumina. Thermal and plasma assisted ALD alumina layers have a negative interface charge. Furthermore, the charge can be changed with an annealing step. ALD is the most common deposition method because it can be done at low temperature < 350\u00b0C, and the deposition leads to an absolute conformal coating. The low deposition temperature makes ALD acceptable for processing finished silicon sensors with metallization. (For fully processed silicon sensors, temperatures must be kept below 450\u00b0C to protect the topside metallization.)",
                        "Beside the interface charge, the interface trap density is also important as an interstrip dielectric. ALD deposited alumina, on either n-or p-type Si, has an extremely low trap density. This is a unique feature for a low-temperature process. A silicon oxide can have a low trap density when the film is thermally grown at high temperatures. The cause for the low trap density is still under investigation. Dingemans et al. claim that the ALD deposition reactions provide elemental hydrogen at the interface for defect passivation [6].",
                        "Finite element (FEM) simulations are carried out with the Atlas Device Simulation software package, produced by Silvaco International. Atlas is a 2-D simulator software, thus, it is important to simulate cross-sections in which the variations of the physical quantities in the third dimension are negligible. All the simulations are performed solving both the Poisson's equation and the carrier continuity equations. In this way, it is possible to have a complete description of the system in terms of electrical quantities (potential and electric field distributions, carrier distributions and current densities). Properly treated Ah03 layers can form negative charges at the silicon interface with densities of \ufffd 10 11 _10 13 cm-2 [4]. Fig. (4) shows a FEM simulation of the electron distribution for an alumina layer n-type silicon substrate (2,000 Qcm). The negative charge (l0 1I cm-2 ) \"pushes\" the electrons away from 114 the interface, providing an effective p-stop layer for inter-strip isolation.  We simulated the resistivity values for alumina and Si02 interstrip isolations as a function of the interface charge, see Fig. (5). The resistivity for alumina is orders of magnitude higher than for Si0 2 . Furthermore, the value of the resistivity for alumina does not significantly change with the charge density. The resistivity of Si0 2 , on the other hand, changes with the charge density. This is a well-know phenomenon for radiation sensors. A thermally grow oxide has a charge density of \ufffd 10 10 _10 11 cm-2 . Under irradiation the positive interface of the oxide can change by up to 2 orders of magnitude, maxing out at \ufffd 10 12 cm-2 . Since the resistivity curve for alumina is effectively flat, we assume that an interface charge change induced by irradiation will not compromise the effectiveness of the alumina as a p-stop. (This still needs to be confirmed experimentally.) "

                        "The wafers were thermally oxidized. We opened the oxide mask on front and back side with RIE (reactive ion etching) steps. The contacts were defined by ion implantation steps: (i) front side boron (p-on-n strips): dose 1.5EI4 cm-2 and energy 50 keV, (ii) back side phosphorous (n-on-n strips): dose IEI4 cm-2 and energy 75 keV. The implants were annealed for 20 min at 950\u00b0C. After annealing the back side oxide for the n-on-n strips was partially removed by a RIE etch step. (The partial oxide removal ensures that we have devices with oxide and alumina as interstrip isolations on the same wafer.) We deposited 80 nm of alumina by thermal ALD (system: Oxford Instruments FlexALD) at 300\u00b0C after a 10 seconds BOE (buffered oxide etch) step. Trimethylaluminum, AI(CH3)3, (TMA) and water, H 2 0, were used as precursors for the aluminum oxide. The BOE step ensures that the silicon surface has a hydrogen termination. The excess alumina was removed by a RIE etch step using a CF4 plasma chemistry. After the RIE step the wafers were annealed at 300\u00b0C for 10 min. Aluminum metal contacts were deposited on the front and back side by e-beam evaporation. "

Fig. (13) shows the IV curves for currents for \"p-stop\" and \"p-spray\" type of devices. The slope of the curves does depend on the type of alumina stop. This could be caused by different breakdown at the edge of the alumina layer. The critical region from the breakdown point of view is localized (i) at the intersection of the n implant and the alumina for the \"p-spray\" type of sensors and (ii) at the intersection of the silicon oxide and alumina for the \"p-stop\" type of sensors. The avalanche is caused by the potential 116 difference forced between these two regions which, in tum, depends on the applied bias voltage [3]. We collected spectra with a Co-57 gamma-ray source with an Amptek Pocket MAC (model 8000A). The HV-power supply was a Silena Model 7716. The shaper was an Ortec 570 (collection time 0.5 Ilsec). We used sensors with alumina (\"p-spray\" type) and silicon oxide as interstrip dielectrics. The sensors originated from the same wafer. All spectra were collected at a bias of -120 V (full depletion at -90 to -100 V). The high voltage was applied at the p-on-n side. We collected spectra from the electron and hole signals, see Figs.     ,,    For the sensors with alumina as an interstrip dielectric, we were able to distinguish the 122 keY peak from the noise for the electron and hole currents, see Fig. (16). Since the alumina acts as an effective p-stop, the leakage currents for the hole signal is low, see Fig. (17). We successfully made a DSSD on n-type material using alumina as a p-stop."
