                "This article describes the fabrication and the performance of paper-based electrochemical sensing devices. We call these devices \u03bcPEDs (microfluidic paper-based electrochemical devices). The \u03bcPEDs are capable of quantifying the concentrations of various analytes in aqueous solutions, including biological fluids such as urine, serum and blood. The \u03bcPEDs comprise microfluidic channels, fabricated from patterned paper (either chromatography paper or a polyester-cellulose blend), and electrodes that were screen-printed on chromatography paper or polyester film (Fig. 1). Three electrodes (a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode) were made from carbon ink or Ag/AgCl ink. This work was carried out independently of a similar and complementary study by Dungchai et al., 1 in which \u03bcPEDs were fabricated and used for electrochemical detection of glucose, lactate, and uric acid in biological samples. Using \u03bcPEDs, we have demonstrated the detection and quantification of glucose in artificial urine using a chronoamperometric analysis based on glucose oxidase. The detection of glucose using the device showed high sensitivity and accuracy over the full range of clinically relevant concentrations of glucose in urine. The detection limit of glucose in the current \u03bcPED is about 0.22 mM (corresponding to 4 mg mL -1 ), which is lower than the approximately 1.0 mM specified by conventional glucometers, and 0.5 mM obtained by a colorimetric detection method reported previously. 2,3 We estimated the sensitivity of the glucose analysis to be 0.43 \u03bcA mM -1 mm -2 . We further demonstrated the use of \u03bcPEDs in the selective analysis of Pb(II) in an aqueous solution containing a mixture of Pb(II) and Zn(II). The continuous wicking of the sample solution across the electrodes dramatically enhanced the efficiency of the deposition of metals during anodic stripping voltammetry, and improved the sensitivity and reliability of the detection. The measurement of Pb(II) showed a limit of detection of 1.0 ppb. This value is much lower than the WHO (World Health Organization) guideline value (<10 ppb) for the safe level of lead in drinking water. 4 We have recently developed methods for fabricating microfluidic devices from patterned paper, and demonstrated that paper-based microfluidic devices can be used for colorimetric detection of glucose and protein in artificial urine. 2,[5][6][7] Low-cost, paper-based diagnostic and analytical devices are attractive for use in developing countries, in the field, or in home health-care settings. 8,9 Although colorimetric assays are the best choice for some applications, electrochemical sensing provides a more versatile and quantitative methodology for others. 10 The \u03bcPEDs described in this article provide a simple, fast, and low-cost (~2 cents per device) platform for the quantitative detection of analytes (biological and inorganic species) in aqueous solutions, including body fluids. This type of detection has five advantages: (i) it is light-weight, portable, single-use and disposable; (ii) it is flexible and foldable; (iii) it has excellent reproducibility with high sensitivity and accuracy; (iv) it does not require professional medical personnel or complicated instruments; and (v) it allows for the integration of high-density detection systems into a small device."

In another set of experiments, we premixed the enzyme solution with glucose samples before the chronoamperometric measurements. We did not observe obvious difference between the two methods. Paper can also be easily modified to immobilize enzymes if necessary. All measurements were conducted at room temperature under ambient conditions.

                        "We used ferrocene carboxylic acid as a model redox-active compound to characterize electrochemical behavior of \u03bcPEDs (Fig. 2a). The peak shape of the CVs shows a typical reversible (Nernstian) electrochemical reaction in which the rate of reaction is governed by the diffusion of the electroactive species to the surface of a planar electrode. 14 The difference in potential between the peaks of the reduction (E pc ) and oxidation (E pa ) curves is 0.068 V (a value that is close to the theoretical value of 0.059 V for the ferrocene redox pair) for all scan rates between 50 and 500 mV s -1 , and the peak current ratio (i pa /i pc ) is equal to 1.0. 14 This reversible behavior indicates that no side reactions take place, and that, as expected, the kinetics of electron transfer is sufficiently rapid to maintain the surface concentrations of redox-active species at the values required by the Nernst equation. Fig. 2b shows that the anodic peak current, i p , is linearly proportional to the square root of the scan rate (\u03bd 1/2 ) in both the bulk solution and the \u03bcPED. The value of diffusion coefficient evaluated by analyzing the slope observed in bulk solution was 4.3 \u00d7 10 -6 cm 2 s -1 (see ESI \u2020), which is fairly close to the reported value of 5.7 \u00d7 10 -6 cm 2 s -1 . 15 The current readout (Fig. 2b) measured using the paper device is about 30% lower than that measured in bulk solution. We presume that this difference is due to the fact that 30-40% of the volume in diffusional contact with the electrodes is occupied by the cellulose fiber of the paper. These results containing the redox-active species do not slow the rate of mass-limited charge transfer relative to that in solution."

Chronoamperometry offers a better signal-to-noise ratio than other electrochemical techniques in this kind of experiment, and the use of a thin slab of fluids mechanically clamped to the electrodes is more resistant to vibration than analysis in a larger volume of solution. 14 The chronoamperometric measurement of current-reflecting charge transfer to/ from the redox-active species as a function of time at constant applied voltages-begins with an initially large capacitive current. Upon the decay of the initial capacitive current within 1-2 s, Faradaic current (the current that is proportional to the concentration of the analyte) dominates. The current, i, decays as t -1/2 as described by the Cottrell equation 14 (eqn ( 4)) (4)   where n is the number of electrons, t is the time, F is Faraday's constant, A is the area of the electrode, D is the diffusion coefficient of analytes, and C is the initial concentration of the reactants.",

Fig. 3a shows a representative chronoamperometric response of the measurements of glucose using a \u03bcPED. Over the range of concentrations of glucose examined (0-22.2 mM), all the response curves reached a steady state 2 s after the step potential (also see the Cottrell plot in ESI \u2020). Fig. 3b shows a calibration curve for the detection of glucose. When the concentration of glucose is in the range of 0-22.2 mM, the current is linearly proportional to the glucose concentration in the artificial urine.",
                        "We tested the interference of the sensing device with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a typical globular protein; serum albumins are present in highest concentrations in serum, and thus relevant to bioanalysis. We found that the presence of 40 \u03bcM BSA did not interfere with the measurement of glucose. This selectivity is due to the specificity of enzymatic oxidation of glucose; the BSA apparently does not foul the electrodes. Comparing the results of the detection of glucose in the \u03bcPEDs to those in bulk solutions (Fig. 3b), we noticed that the two methods showed comparable sensitivity and detection limits; the paper matrix does not interfere with the detection. The paper matrix in the \u03bcPEDs has, however, several advantages: (i) it stabilizes the geometry of the electrode; (ii) it reduces the effect of convection of liquids due to random motion, vibration and heating; (iii) it minimizes the total volume of solution required for analysis. The normal level of glucose in urine is 0.1-0.8 mM and 3.5-5.3 mM in whole blood. 3 Our device should therefore be capable of measuring glucose in other biological fluids such as serum and blood (see measurement of glucose in blood plasma and whole blood in ESI \u2020). The detection limit of glucose in the current \u03bcPED is about 0.22 mM (corresponding to 4 mg mL -1 ). This value is below the approximately 1.0 mM claimed in specifications of conventional glucometers, and 0.5 mM obtained by colorimetric detection method reported previously. 2,3 We estimate the sensitivity of the glucose analysis to be 0.43 \u03bcA mM -1 mm -2 . In principle, other species in real urine and blood may interfere when we use 500 mV potentials for the analysis of glucose. The potential can be reduced to around 300 mV for the measurements in biological fluids, thanks to the enzymatic selectivity of glucose oxidase. The paper-based device also has the potential to be integrated with various separation techniques such as paper chromatography to minimize interferences."

Square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) is an ASV method frequently used for the measurement of trace heavy metals because it greatly reduces the background noise coming from the charging current during the potential scan. 18,19 Conventional ASV measurements of heavy-metal ions are usually performed either by dipping electrodes in a sample solution under controlled stirring condition or by placing a sample droplet onto the electrodes. [20][21][22][23] The former approach is not practical in field measurements due to the difficulty of synchronizing the stirring and ASV procedures. 20 The latter one shows limited sensitivity of measurement because pre-accumulation of analytes in stripping is limited by diffusion. Additionally, in this case, new electrodes are usually required for each measurement since it is difficult to remove the residue of deposited metals in a stagnant drop of solution before the next cycle of ASV.",
                        "We have demonstrated the use of \u03bcPEDs in the selective measurement of Pb(II) in an aqueous mixture of Pb(II) and Zn(II) using SWASV. We modified the design of the \u03bcPED by introducing a pad of cellulose blotting paper as a sink in the outlet of the paper channel (Fig. 1c) (see ESI \u2020). The \u03bcPED allows the continuous wicking of fluids to pass across the electrodes, and facilitates the plating of metals, as well as the cleaning of electrodes. By tuning the size of the cellulose blotting paper, we optimized the wicking time of fluids in the paper channel of \u03bcPEDs so that the flow stopped before the system entered the equilibration step in the process of SWASV. 24 Fig. 4 displays representative stripping voltammograms for the measurement of 25 ppb (\u03bcg L -1 ) Pb(II) in acetate buffer solution in the presence of Zn(II). The voltammograms in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs, in which the fluid of the sample solution continuously wicked in the paper microchannel, showed a well-defined, sharp peak for Pb(II) at ca. 780 mV vs. the Ag/ AgCl reference electrode (C and D in Fig. 4). In contrast, under the same SWASV conditions, a stagnant solution of analytes, both in the \u03bcPEDs (without a pad of blotting paper as a sink) and in an experiment that placed a droplet of sample solution on the electrodes, resulted in a much weaker signal (A in Fig. 4) or a poorly defined response (B in Fig. 4). The hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs thus exhibited a much higher sensitivity by a factor of five than the stagnant systems. We ascribe the enhanced sensitivity of the dynamic system to the high efficiency of the accumulation of metals on the electrodes by convection of flowing fluids in the porous matrix of paper over the electrodes, and to the large volume (~800 \u03bcL) of sample that flows across the surface of the electrodes.",
                        "In the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs, the peak current of the analysis of Pb (II) dramatically increased with increasing the deposition time (Fig. 4). The peak current increased from 3.9 \u03bcA to 10.3 \u03bcA with the increase of deposition time from 120 s to 360 s. This increase was not obvious in the stagnant systems, since the deposition efficiency decays quickly with time due to the mass-transfer-limited reaction in the vicinity of the surface of electrodes. Moreover, we found that the stagnant \u03bcPEDs showed a more poorly defined signal, compared to the system with a drop of sample solution directly placed onto the electrodes (Fig. 4). We presume that this is because the cellulose matrix in the stagnant \u03bcPEDs inhibits convective movement of the solutions, and thus affected the stripping behavior of Pb(II).",
                        "The stripping voltammograms for the analysis of Pb(II) in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs showed well-defined peaks and a strong signal over a wide range of concentrations of Pb(II); this level of performance offers convenient quantification of low ppb levels of lead (Fig. 5a). The peak intensity increases proportionally with the concentration of Pb(II), which yields a highly linear calibration plot with a slope of 0.17 \u03bcA ppb -1 for lead (correlation coefficient, 0.996) (Fig. 5b). The limit of detection of lead was estimated from the signal-to-noise characteristics of the data to be approximately 1.0 ppb (\u03bcg L -1 ); this value is even lower than 2.5 ppb obtained in conventional systems with controlled stirring. [20][21][22]25,26 This value is also much lower than the 10 ppb (\u03bcg L -1 ) WHO guideline value for lead concentration in drinking water. 4 We believe that even lower concentrations of lead could be detected if longer deposition periods were used. The sensitive measurement of Pb(II) in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs is highly reproducible, as indicated by the low relative standard deviation.",
                        "We compared the performance of the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs for the analysis of lead with the stagnant system, in which a drop of sample solution was placed on electrodes (Fig. 5b). The stagnant system exhibits a much lower sensitivity of 0.05 \u03bcA ppb -1 for lead (correlation coefficient, 0.978), and a higher limit of detection of 4.3 ppb, than the dynamic measurement. Unlike the stagnant system, small perturbations (e.g., vibration, heating) did not interfere with the analysis of lead in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs due to the stabilization of the flow of the sample solution by the paper matrix; this stabilization results in a high reliability and reproducibility of the measurements. The device is reusable by simply replacing the pad of blotting paper, since the continuous wicking removes dissolved analytes before the next cycle of the deposition of metals."

It provides a thin, mechanically stabilized film of water or other fluids that deliver analytes to the surface of the electrodes. The fact that the cellulose matrix is mechanically rigid, and that the electrodes are in physical contact with the paper slab containing the analytes inhibits convective movement of the solutions after the complete wetting of the paper channel with fluids, and thus increases the accuracy of time-dependent measurements (chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry). The continuous capillary wicking of fluids along the paper channel and across the electrode that is easily accomplished by introducing a cellulose blotting paper that acts as a sink provides an excellent platform for the measurements required for convection and hydrodynamic conditions (anodic stripping voltammetry, hydrodynamic amperometry and voltammetry).",
                "Electrochemistry substantially increases the scope of options for detection using paper and fiber-based systems. 1,27,28 We have demonstrated the chronoamperometric analysis of glucose, and the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry measurements of heavy-metal ions using \u03bcPEDs. The resulting analysis of glucose is similar to that in bulk solution (the cellulose matrix occupies 30-40% of the volume of the space between the electrodes, and limiting differential currents are accordingly ~30% lower on paper than unstirred bulk solution). The measurements of heavy-metal ions in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs have higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection (ca. 1.0 ppb) than conventional systems with controlled stirring (ca. 2.5 ppb). 21,29 The \u03bcPEDs thus have three important advantages over conventional systems with controlled stirring: (i) they are simple, low-cost, and portable, (ii) they do not require extra instruments, such as stirring plates, and (iii) they are reusable, and are easily disposable after use.",
                "The use of conductive inks to print electrodes is well suited for mass production using screen-printing technology. This methodology is suitable for further miniaturization, and to accommodate smaller lateral spacing between electrodes, and thus (with development) to higher density of detectors. The resulting paper-based electrochemical sensing devices combine the advantages of paper-based microfluidics-low-cost, small sample volumes, capillary wicking of fluids, facile multiplexed assays-with the advantages of electrochemical detection-high sensitivity, quantitative analysis, rapid response and applicability to a wide range of analytes. For the use in the field, it would be necessary to develop a portable electrochemical reader. The \u03bcPEDs described in the paper could easily be adapted to a portable reader. The development of this kind of devices is underway in this lab.    The SWASV was performed in the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V under optimized conditions: frequency, 20 Hz; amplitude, 25 mV; potential increment, 5 mV; equilibration time, 30 s. Deposition was performed at -1.2 V; 'cleaning' was performed at +0.5 V for 60 s. A bismuth(III) concentration of 500 \u03bcg L -1 was chosen for the co-deposition of heavymetal ions. We used screen-printed carbon electrodes as the working and counter electrodes, and a screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. Inset shows the schematic of the four steps of the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The resulting calibration plots for the analysis of trace Pb(II): a 100 \u03bcL solution of analytes placed on the electrodes (\u25cb), and a solution of analytes continuously wicking along the paper channel in the \u03bcPEDs (\u25a1). Square-wave voltammetric stripping was performed in the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V under optimized conditions: frequency, 20 Hz; amplitude, 25 mV; potential increment, 5 mV; equilibration time, 30 s. Deposition was performed at -1.2 V for 120 s; 'cleaning' was performed at +0.5 V for 60 s. A bismuth(III) concentration of 500 \u03bcg L -1 was chosen for the co-deposition of heavy-metal ions. We used screen-printed carbon electrodes as working and counter electrodes, and a screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference. The solid lines represent a linear fit to (\u25cb) with regression equation: y = -0.08 + 0.05x (R 2 = 0.978, n = 8), and a linear fit to (\u25a1) with regression equation: y = -0.21 + 0.17x (R 2 = 0.996, n = 8)."
