                        "In recent years, microfluidic systems have attracted increasing interests due to their diverse and widespread potential applications. For example, using very small volumes of samples, microfluidic systems could carry out complicated biochemical reactions to acquire important chemical and biological information. Among other advantages, microfluidic systems reduce the required amount of samples and reagents, shorten the response time of reactions, and decrease the amount of biohazard waste for disposal.",
                        "First developed in the early 1990s, microfluidic devices were initially fabricated in silicon and glass using photolithography and etching techniques adapted from the microelectronics industry. Current microfluidic devices are constructed from plastic, silicone, or other polymeric materials, e.g. polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Such devices are generally expensive, inflexible, and difficult to construct.",
                        "Electrochemical analysis involves methods of measuring the potential and/or current of a fluidic sample containing analytes, which is widely used in the medicinal field or in environmental studies. Electrochemical analysis usually utilizes sophisticated instruments and is conducted by specially-trained technicians. However, for use in developing countries, in the field, or in-home heath-care settings, there remains a need for analytical devices that are inexpensive, portable, and easy to construct and use."

                                "The pollution of heavy-metal ions in soil and water presents a global issue, and poses a severe threat to both the ecosystem and humans. Square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) is an ASV method frequently used for the measurement of trace heavy metals because it greatly reduces the background noise coming from the charging current during the potential scan. Conventional ASV measurements of heavy metal ions are usually performed either by dipping electrodes in a sample solution under controlled stirring condition or by placing a sample droplet onto the electrodes. The former approach is not practical in field measurements due to the difficulty of synchronizing the stirring and ASV procedures. The latter one shows limited sensitivity of measurement because pre-accumulation of analytes in stripping is limited by diffusion. Additionally, in this case, new electrodes are usually required for each measurement since it is difficult to remove the residue of deposited metals in a stagnant drop of solution before the next cycle of ASV.",

In some specific embodiments, Pb(II) is detected by the use of the microfluidic, electrochemical device described herein. In some embodiments, a fluid sink is included in the microfluidic, electrochemical devices. In some specific embodiments, the fluid sink is a pad of cellulose blotting paper as a sink in the outlet of the hydrophilic channel (see FIG. 3). The use of an absorbing pad allows the continuous wicking of fluids to pass across the electrodes, and facilitates the plating of metals, as well as the cleaning of electrodes. In some embodiments, the size of the cellulose blotting paper is adjusted to optimize the wicking time of fluids in the hydrophilic channel so that the flow stopped before the system entered the equilibration step in the process of SWASV, which results in higher sensitivity and reproducibility of the measurement. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the enhanced sensitivity can be attributed to the high efficiency of the accumulation of metals on the electrodes by convection of flowing fluids in the porous, hydrophilic channels over the electrodes, and to the large volume (\u02dc800 \u03bcL) of sample that flows across the surface of the electrodes.",

                                "The use of a \u03bcPED in the analysis of glucose in artificial urine was demonstrated using chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometry offers a better signal-to-noise ratio than other electrochemical techniques in this kind of experiment, and the use of a thin slab of fluids mechanically clamped to the electrodes is more resistant to vibration than analysis in a larger volume of solution. The chronoamperometric measurement of current\u2014reflecting charge transfer to/from the redox-active species as a function of time at constant applied voltages\u2014begins with an initially large capacitive current. Upon the decay of the initial capacitive current within one to two seconds, Faradaic current (the current that is proportional to the concentration of the analyte) dominates. The current, I, decays as t\u22121/2 as described by the Cottrell",

                                "The \u03bcPED confines fluids in the paper channel, inhibits the convective movement of fluids, and thus facilitates the chronoamperometric measurements by minimizing the disturbances of the stationary boundary layer in the vicinity of electrodes due to vibration, thermal or density-based convection, and other disturbing sources. FIG. 6a shows a representative chronoamperometric response of the measurements of glucose using a \u03bcPED. Over the range of concentrations of glucose examined (0-22.2 mM), all the response curves reached a steady state two seconds after the step potential (also see the Cottrell plot in supplementary information). FIG. 6b shows a calibration curve for the detection of glucose. When the concentration of glucose was in the range of 0-22.2 mM, the current was linearly proportional to the glucose concentration in the artificial urine.",
                                "The interference of the sensing device with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a typical globular protein; serum albumins are present in highest concentrations in serum, and thus relevant to bioanalysis. It was found that the presence of 40 \u03bcM BSA did not interfere with the measurement of glucose; this selectivity is due to the specificity of enzymatic oxidation of glucose; the BSA apparently does not foul the electrodes. Comparing the results of the detection of glucose in the \u03bcPEDs to those in bulk solutions (FIG. 6b), it was noticed that the two methods showed comparable sensitivity and detection limits; the paper matrix did not intefere with the detection. The paper matrix in the \u03bcPEDs has, however, several advantages: i) it stabilizes the geometry of the electrode; ii) it reduces the effect of convection of liquids due to random motion, vibration and heating; iii) it minimizes the total volume of solution required for analysis. The normal level of glucose in urine is 0.1-0.8 mM, and 3.5-5.3 mM in whole blood. The \u03bcPED device should therefore be capable of measuring glucose in other biological fluids such as serum and blood. The detection limit of glucose in the current \u03bcPED was about 0.22 mM (corresponding to 4 mg/mL). This value is below the approximately 1.0 mM claimed in specifications of conventional glucometers, and 0.5 mM obtained by colorimetric detection method reported previously. It was estimated the sensitivity of the glucose analysis to be 0.43 \u03bcA\u00b7mM\u22121\u00b7mm\u22122. In principle, other species in real urine and blood may interfere when, 500 mV potentials ae used for the analysis of glucose. The potential can be reduced to around 300 mV for the measurements in biological fluids, thanks to the enzymatic selectivity of glucose oxidase. The paper-based device also has the potential to be integrated with various separation techniques such as paper chromatography to minimize interferences.",

                                "Heavy-metal ions such as mercury, lead, and cadmium are toxic, non-biodegradable, and tend to accumulate in plants and animals. The pollution of heavy-metal ions in soil and water presents a global issue, and poses a severe threat to both the ecosystem and humans. Square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) is an ASV method frequently used for the measurement of trace heavy metals because it greatly reduces the background noise coming from the charging current during the potential scan. Conventional ASV measurements of heavy metal ions are usually performed either by dipping electrodes in a sample solution under controlled stirring condition or by placing a sample droplet onto the electrodes. The former approach is not practical in field measurements due to the difficulty of synchronizing the stirring and ASV procedures. The latter one shows limited sensitivity of measurement because pre-accumulation of analytes in stripping is limited by diffusion. Additionally, in this case, new electrodes are usually required for each measurement since it is difficult to remove the residue of deposited metals in a stagnant drop of solution before the next cycle of ASV.",
                                "It was demonstrated that \u03bcPEDs can be used in the selective measurement of Pb(II) in an aqueous mixture of Pb(II) and Zn(II) using SWASV. The designed of \u03bcPEDs was modified by introducing a pad of cellulose blotting paper as a sink in the outlet of the paper channel (FIG. 3c). The \u03bcPED allowed the continuous wicking of fluids to pass across the electrodes, and facilitated the plating of metals, as well as the cleaning of electrodes. By tuning the size of the cellulose blotting paper, the wicking time of fluids in the paper channel of \u03bcPEDs was optimized so that the flow stopped before the system entered the equilibration step in the process of SWASV.",
                                "FIG. 8 displays representative stripping voltammograms for the measurement of 25 ppb (\u03bcg/L) Pb(II) in acetate buffer solution in the presence of Zn(II). The voltammograms in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs, in which the fluid of the sample solution continuously wicked in the paper microchannel, showed a well-defined, sharp peak for Pb(II) at ca. 780 mV versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (C and D in FIG. 8). In contrast, under the same SWASV conditions, a stagnant solution of analytes, both in the \u03bcPEDs (without a pad of blotting paper as a sink) and in an experiment that placed a droplet of sample solution on the electrodes, resulted in a much weaker signal (A in FIG. 8) or a poorly-defined response (B in FIG. 8). The hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs thus exhibited a much higher sensitivity by a factor of five than the stagnant systems.",
                                "In the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs, the peak current of the analysis of Pb (II) dramatically increased with increasing the deposition time (FIG. 8). The peak current increased from 3.9 \u03bcA to 10.3 \u03bcA with the increase of deposition time from 120 s to 360 s. This increase was not obvious in the stagnant systems, since the deposition efficiency decays quickly with time due to the mass-transfer-limited reaction in the vicinity of the surface of electrodes. Moreover, it was found that the stagnant \u03bcPEDs showed a more poorly defined signal, compared to the system with a drop of sample solution directly placed onto the electrodes (FIG. 8). It is presumed that this is because the cellulose matrix in the stagnant \u03bcPEDs inhibits convective movement of the solutions, and thus affected the stripping behavior of Pb(II).",
                                "The stripping voltammograms for the analysis of Pb(II) in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs showed well-defined peaks and a strong signal over a wide range of concentrations of Pb(II); this level of performance offers convenient quantification of low ppb levels of lead (FIG. 9a). The peak intensity increased proportionally with the concentration of Pb(II), which yielded a highly linear calibration plot with a slope of 0.17 \u03bcA\u00b7ppb\u22121 for lead (correlation coefficient, 0.996) (FIG. 9b). The limit of detection of lead was estimated from the signal-to-noise characteristics of the data to be approximately 1.0 ppb (\u03bcg/L); this value is even lower than 2.5 ppb obtained in conventional systems with controlled stirring. This value is also much lower than the 10 ppb (\u03bcg/L) WHO guideline value for lead concentration in drinking water. It is believed that even lower concentrations of lead could be detected if longer deposition periods were used. The sensitive measurement of Pb(II) in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs is highly reproducible, as indicated by the low relative standard deviation.",
                                "The performance of the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs for the analysis of lead was compared with the stagnant system, in which a drop of sample solution was placed on electrodes (FIG. 9b). The stagnant system exhibited a much lower sensitivity of 0.05 \u03bcA\u00b7ppb\u22121 for lead (correlation coefficient, 0.978), and a higher limit of detection of 4.3 ppb, than the dynamic measurement. Unlike the stagnant system, small perturbations (e.g., vibration, heating) did not interfere with the analysis of lead in the hydrodynamic \u03bcPEDs due to the stabilization of the flow of the sample solution by the paper matrix; this stabilization resulted in a high reliability and reproducibility of the measurements. The device can be reused by simply replacing the pad of blotting paper, since the continuous wicking removes dissolved analytes before the next cycle of the deposition of metals.",

                                "The performance of the \u03bcPED with different arrangements of the working and counter electrodes was compared. FIG. 7 shows a paper device with another geometry where the working and counter electrodes were placed face-to-face at top and bottom of the paper channel (\u201cF-F \u03bcPED\u201d). The device where working and counter electrodes were placed side-by-side beneath the paper channel is referred to as \u201cS-S \u03bcPED.\u201d",
                                "FIG. 7 shows the peak current in CV experiments as a function of the square root of the scan rate, \u03bd1/2. Under the same experimental conditions, the F-F \u03bcPED showed higher response currents in CV experiments, than did the corresponding S-S \u03bcPED. The F-F configuration probably has a higher effective surface area for electrochemical reactions can take place than the S-S configuration, since the electrochemical reactions take place between the two electrodes. The slope of the plot of the F-F \u03bcPED was close to that of the measurements in bulk solution. These results demonstrate that the configuration of electrodes influences the performance of the \u03bcPED, and that the paper material does not interfere with the electrochemistry. In terms of the spatial arrangement of electrodes, the flow passes through the working and counter electrodes in the F-F \u03bcPED at the same time, rather than in sequence as in S-S \u03bcPED. It is thought that the F-F \u03bcPED should show a performance superior in following the concentration of analytes flowing continuously in the paper channels. The F-F organization of electrodes also allows dense packing of sensors than S-S.",

Paper devices with electrodes made from gold stripes showed excellent performance in cyclic voltammetry, but were less robust than the carbon-based electrodes. FIG. 10 shows that the electrochemical reactions were reversible on Au electrodes in the \u03bcPEDs."
