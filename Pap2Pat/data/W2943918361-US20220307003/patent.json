                        "Base editors enable the precise installation of targeted point mutations in genomic DNA without creating double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) (1-3). Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert a target A.T base pair to a G.C base pair (1). Because the mutation of G.C base pairs to A.T base pairs is the primary form of de novo mutation (4), ABEs have the potential to correct almost half of known human pathogenic point mutations (5). The adenine base editor, ABE7.10, can perform remarkably clean and efficient A.T-to-G.C conversion in DNA with very low levels of undesirable byproducts such as small insertions or deletions (indels) in cultured cells, adult mice, plants, and other organisms (1, 6-10).",
                        "Off-target base editing can arise from guide RNA-dependent or guide RNA-independent editing events (1, 3). The former results from RNA-guided binding of the Cas9 domain to DNA sites that are similar, but not identical, to the target DNA locus (7, 20-23).",
                        "Separately, adenine base editors may induce off-target editing of cellular RNA. Unintended editing of cellular RNA could introduce deleterious effects on the function of translated proteins, and potential associated cytotoxicity. There is an unrecognized need in the art for adenine base editors that have reduced RNA editing activity while retaining high DNA editing efficiency."

                        "The discovery and widespread implementation of the CRISPR/Cas system has dramatically expanded the toolbox for genome engineering and has revolutionized the future prospects of basic biological research, data storage in living systems, agricultural science, and medicine. The recent development of adenine base editors by fusion of a deaminase to Cas9 enables guide RNA (gRNA)-targeted single nucleotide deamination for A:T base pair conversion to G:C using adenine base editors within a specific target window. Base editing has been broadly demonstrated with high efficiency in a range of species, including human zygotes.",
                        "Various engineered base editors with improved DNA editing efficiencies have been developed. Reference is made to Komor, A. C. et al., Improved base excision repair inhibition and bacteriophage Mu Gam protein yields C:G-to-T:A base editors with higher efficiency and product purity, Sci Adv 3 (2017); Rees, H.

Commun. 8, 15790 (2017); U.S. Patent Publication No. 2018/0073012, published Mar. 15, 2018; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2017/0121693, published May 4, 2017; International Publication No. WO 2017/070633, published Apr. 27, 2017; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0166980, published Jun. 18, 2015, U.S. Pat. No. 9,840,699, issued Dec. 12, 2017; and U.S. Pat. No. 10,077,453, issued Sep. 18, 2018, each of which are incorporated herein in their entireties. Base editors (BEs) may be fusions of a Cas (\u201cCRISPR-associated\u201d) domain and a nucleobase (or \u201cbase\u201d) modification domain (e.g., a natural or evolved deaminase, such as an adenosine deaminase domain). In some cases, base editors may also include proteins or domains that affect cellular DNA repair processes to increase the efficiency and/or stability of the resulting single-nucleotide change.",
                        "Base editors reported to date contain a catalytically impaired Cas9 domain fused to a nucleobase modification domain. The Cas9 domain directs the nucleobase modification domain to directly convert one base to another at a guide RNA-programmed target site. Two classes of base editors have been developed to date: Cytosine base editors (CBEs), which convert C.G to T.A, and adenine base editors (ABEs), which convert A.T to G.C. Collectively, CBEs and ABEs enable the correction of all four types of transition mutations (C to T, G to A, A to G, and T to C). As half of known disease-associated gene variants are point mutations, and transition mutations account for \u02dc60% of known pathogenic point mutations, base editors are being widely used to study and treat genetic diseases in a variety of cell types and organisms, including animal models of human genetic diseases.",
                        "ABEs are especially useful for the study and correction of pathogenic alleles, as nearly half of pathogenic point mutations in principle can be corrected by converting an A.T base pair to a G.C base pair. Many of the ABEs reported to date include a single polypeptide chain containing a heterodimer of a wild-type E. coli TadA monomer (ecTadA, or TadA) that plays a structural role during base editing and a laboratory-evolved E. coli TadA monomer TadA7.10 (also referred to herein as \u201cTadA*\u201d) that catalyzes deoxyadenosine deamination, and a Cas9 (D10A) nickase. Wild type E. coli TadA acts as a homodimer to deaminate an adenosine located in a tRNA anticodon loop, generating inosine (I). Although early ABE variants required a heterodimeric TadA containing an N-terminal wild-type TadA monomer for maximal activity, Joung et al. showed that later ABE variants have comparable activity with and without the wild-type TadA monomer.",
                        "The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the mutagenesis of existing adenine base editors to provide variant ABEs that have reduced off-target effects while retaining high DNA editing efficiency. The adenosine deaminase domain of the ABE7.10 base editor comprises a heterodimer of two adenosine deaminases, one of which is TadA7.10, a deoxyadenosine deaminase that was previously evolved from an E. coli tRNA adenosine deaminase to act on single-stranded DNA. (The other deaminase of the heterodimer is a wild-type ecTadA.) TadA7.10 is also comprised within the deaminase domain of ABEmax, which is a variant of ABE7.10 that has been codon-optimized for expression in human cells. TadA7.10 comprises the following substitutions in ecTadA: W23R, H36L, P48A, R51L, L84F, A106V, D108N, H123Y, S146C, D147Y, R152P, E155V, I156F, and K157N.

                        "Many ABEs reported to date comprise single polypeptide chains containing three fused protein components: a wild-type E. coli TadA monomer that plays a structural role during base editing, a laboratory-evolved E. coli TadA monomer TadA7.10 that catalyzes deoxyadenosine deamination, and a Cas9 (D10A) nickase (1, 3) (see FIGS. 1A, 13A). E. coli TadA natively acts as a homodimer to deaminate an adenine located in a tRNA anticodon loop (25), generating inosine (I) (the adenosine is deaminated to a hypoxanthine).",
                        "It was hypothesized that the wild-type TadA monomer, which natively acts on RNA but has strict sequence requirements (25, 26), and/or the evolved TadA7.10 monomer, which was evolved to accept ssDNA as a substrate and to have broad sequence compatibility, may be able to catalyze the deamination of cellular RNA (1, 3) (see FIG. 1B). While no substantial ABE7.10-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing was previously observed in HEK293T cells among a handful of abundant transcripts sequenced at modest depth (1), the association of elevated endogenous A-to-I editing in the transcriptome with disease (27) warranted a more comprehensive examination of possible ABE-mediated RNA editing. In particular, recent studies have identified aberrant A-to-I editing as a mechanism by which tumors can develop a resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (28).",
                        "Guide RNA-dependent off-target base editing has been reduced through strategies including installation of mutations that increase DNA specificity into the Cas9 component of base editors, adding 5\u2032 guanosine nucleotides to the sgRNA, or delivery of the base editor as a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) (19, 22, 24). Guide RNA-independent off-target editing can arise from binding of the deaminase domain of a base editor to C or A bases in a Cas9-independent manner (3). Recent studies characterized guide RNA-independent off-target DNA editing activity of BE3, the original CBE, in mouse embryos (18) and in rice (17). In contrast with BE3, ABE7.10 in these studies did not result in detectable guide RNA-independent off-target DNA mutations (17, 18). The efficiency of base editors was recently improved through codon- and nuclear localization sequence-optimization to generate ABEmax (15). ABEmax was shown to generate low but detectable levels of widespread adenosine-to-inosine editing in cellular RNAs. The present disclosure is aimed to satisfy a heretofore unrecognized need in the art for the reduction of off-target editing of RNA induced by the deaminase domains of ABEmax and other current adenine base editors.",
                        "To address the above-described deficiency in the art, targeted mutagenesis guided by an analysis of deaminase structure was applied to wild-type ecTadA and TadA7.10 deaminases to minimize the ribonucleotide deaminating activity of the domain comprising both deaminases, i.e., the adenosine deaminating activity in RNA. TadA(V106W), an exemplary variant emerging from these mutagenesis experiments, contains a single substitution relative to TadA7.10 at residue 106. TadA(E59A), another exemplary variant emerging from these mutagenesis experiments, contains a single substitution of ecTadA at residue 59. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides TadA(V106W), TadA(E59A), and other TadA7.10 deaminase variants. Adenosine deaminase domains comprising one or more of these variants exhibit reduced off-target effects, such as reduced RNA deamination activity. The present disclosure also provides improved adenine base editors that comprise an adenosine deaminase domain comprising a TadA variant, such as a TadA(E59A), and/or a TadA7.10 variant, such as TadA(V106W). Accordingly, the disclosure provides adenine base editors that are variants of ABE7.10, or ABEmax. The disclosure also provides editing methods, kits and compositions that make use of these ABEmax variants, which minimize the induction of RNA editing in cells.",

                        "\u201cBase editing\u201d refers to genome editing technology that involves the conversion of a specific nucleic acid base into another at a targeted genomic locus. In certain embodiments, this can be achieved without requiring double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB), or single stranded breaks (i.e., nicking). To date, other genome editing techniques, including CRISPR-based systems, begin with the introduction of a DSB at a locus of interest. Subsequently, cellular DNA repair enzymes mend the break, commonly resulting in random insertions or deletions (indels) of bases at the site of the DSB. However, when the introduction or correction of a point mutation at a target locus is desired rather than stochastic disruption of the entire gene, these genome editing techniques are unsuitable, as correction rates are low (e.g. typically 0.1% to 5%), with the major genome editing products being indels. In order to increase the efficiency of gene correction without simultaneously introducing random indels, the present inventors previously modified the CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly convert one DNA base into another without DSB formation.

                        "The term \u201cbase editor (BE)\u201d as used herein, refers to an agent comprising a polypeptide that is capable of making a modification to a base (e.g., A, T, C, G, or U) within a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., DNA or RNA). In some embodiments, the base editor is capable of deaminating a base within a nucleic acid such as a base within a DNA molecule. In the case of an adenine base editor, the base editor is capable of deaminating an adenine (A) in DNA. Such base editors may include a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp) fused to an adenosine deaminase. Some base editors include CRISPR-mediated fusion proteins that are utilized in the base editing methods described herein. In some embodiments, the base editor comprises a nuclease-inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a deaminase which binds a nucleic acid in a guide RNA-programmed manner via the formation of an R-loop, but does not cleave the nucleic acid. For example, the dCas9 domain of the fusion protein may include a D10A and a H840A mutation (which renders Cas9 capable of cleaving only one strand of a nucleic acid duplex), as described in PCT/US2016/058344, which published as WO 2017/070632 on Apr. 27, 2017 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The DNA cleavage domain of S. pyogenes Cas9 includes two subdomains, the HNH nuclease subdomain and the RuvC1 subdomain. The HNH subdomain cleaves the strand complementary to the gRNA (the \u201ctargeted strand\u201d, or the strand in which editing or deamination occurs), whereas the RuvC1 subdomain cleaves the non-complementary strand containing the PAM sequence (the \u201cnon-edited strand\u201d). The RuvC1 mutant D10A generates a nick in the targeted strand, while the HNH mutant H840A generates a nick on the non-edited strand (see Jinek et al., Science, 337:816-821(2012); Qi et al., Cell. 28; 152(5):1173-83 (2013)).",

                        "\u201cCRISPR\u201d is a family of DNA sequences (i.e., CRISPR clusters) in bacteria and archaea that represent snippets of prior infections by a virus that have invaded the prokaryote. The snippets of DNA are used by the prokaryotic cell to detect and destroy DNA from subsequent attacks by similar viruses and effectively constitute, along with an array of CRISPR-associated proteins (including Cas9 and homologs thereof) and CRISPR-associated RNA, a prokaryotic immune defense system. In nature, CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In certain types of CRISPR systems (e.g., type II CRISPR systems), correct processing of pre-crRNA requires a trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA), endogenous ribonuclease 3 (rnc) and a Cas9 protein. The tracrRNA serves as a guide for ribonuclease 3-aided processing of pre-crRNA. Subsequently, Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA endonucleolytically cleaves linear or circular nucleic acid target complementary to the RNA. Specifically, the target strand not complementary to crRNA is first cut endonucleolytically, then trimmed 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonucleolytically. In nature, DNA-binding and cleavage typically requires protein and both RNAs. However, single guide RNAs (\u201csgRNA\u201d, or simply \u201cgRNA\u201d) may be engineered so as to incorporate embodiments of both the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single RNA species\u2014the guide RNA.

An important goal of DNA base editing efficiency is the modification (e.g. deamination) of a specific nucleotide within DNA, without introducing modifications of similar nucleotides within RNA. RNA editing effects are \u201clow\u201d or \u201creduced\u201d when a detected mutation is introduced into RNA molecules at a frequency of 0.3% or less. For reference, the ABEmax base editor introduces edits into RNA at a frequency of about 0.50%. RNA editing effects are \u201clow\u201d or \u201creduced\u201d when a mutation is detected at a magnitude that is less than about 70,000 edits within an analyzed mRNA transcriptome. The number of RNA edits may be measured by techniques known in the art, including high-throughput screening of sequencing reads and RNA-seq. The effects of RNA editing on the function of a protein translated from the edited mRNA transcript may be predicted by use of the SIFT (\u201cSorting Intolerant from Tolerant\u201d) algorithm, which bases predictions on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids.",

In embodiments where the vector is a viral vector, a suitable host cell is a cell that may be infected by the viral vector, can replicate it, and can package it into viral particles that can infect fresh host cells. A cell can host a viral vector if it supports expression of genes of viral vector, replication of the viral genome, and/or the generation of viral particles. One criterion to determine whether a cell is a suitable host cell for a given viral vector is to determine whether the cell can support the viral life cycle of a wild-type viral genome that the viral vector is derived from. For example, if the viral vector is a modified M13 phage genome, as provided in some embodiments described herein, then a suitable host cell would be any cell that can support the wild-type M13 phage life cycle. Suitable host cells for viral vectors useful in continuous evolution processes are well known to those of skill in the art, and the disclosure is not limited in this respect.

Mutations are typically described herein by identifying the original residue followed by the position of the residue within the sequence and by the identity of the newly substituted residue. Various methods for making the amino acid substitutions (mutations) provided herein are well known in the art, and are provided by, for example, Green and Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (4th ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2012)). Mutations can include a variety of categories, such as single base polymorphisms, microduplication regions, indel, and inversions, and is not meant to be limiting in any way. Mutations can include \u201closs-of-function\u201d mutations which is a result of a mutation that reduces or abolishes a protein activity. Most loss-of-function mutations are recessive, because in a heterozygote the second chromosome copy carries an unmutated version of the gene coding for a fully functional protein whose presence compensates for the effect of the mutation. There are some exceptions where a loss-of-function mutation is dominant, one example being haploinsufficiency, where the organism is unable to tolerate the approximately 50% reduction in protein activity suffered by the heterozygote. This is the explanation for a few genetic diseases in humans, including Marfan syndrome, which results from a mutation in the gene for the connective tissue protein called fibrillin. Mutations also embrace \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutations, which is one which confers an abnormal activity on a protein or cell that is otherwise not present in a normal condition. Many gain-of-function mutations are in regulatory sequences rather than in coding regions, and can therefore have a number of consequences. For example, a mutation might lead to one or more genes being expressed in the wrong tissues, these tissues gaining functions that they normally lack. Alternatively the mutation could lead to overexpression of one or more genes involved in control of the cell cycle, thus leading to uncontrolled cell division and hence to cancer. Because of their nature, gain-of-function mutations are usually dominant.",

For instance, a variant of Cas9 may comprise a Cas9 that has one or more changes in amino acid residues as compared to a wild type Cas9 amino acid sequence. As another example, a variant of a deaminase may comprise a deaminase that has one or more changes in amino acid residues as compared to a wild type deaminase amino acid sequence, e.g. following ancestral sequence reconstruction of the deaminase. These changes include chemical modifications, including substitutions of different amino acid residues truncations, covalent additions (e.g. of a tag), and any other mutations. This term also embraces fragments of a wild type protein.",
                        "The level or degree of which the property is retained may be reduced relative to the wild type protein but is typically the same or similar in kind. Generally, variants are overall very similar, and in many regions, identical to the amino acid sequence of the protein described herein. A skilled artisan will appreciate how to make and use variants that maintain all, or at least some, of a functional ability or property.",
                        "The variant proteins may comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid sequence which is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%, identical to, for example, the amino acid sequence of a wild-type protein, or any protein provided herein (e.g. Cas9 protein, fusion protein, and fusion protein protein). Further polypeptides provided in the disclosure are encoded by polynucleotides which hybridize to the complement of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein such as a Cas9 protein under stringent hybridization conditions (e.g. hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6\u00d7 Sodium chloride/Sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 degrees Celsius, followed by one or more washes in 0.2.times.SSC, 0.1% SDS at about 50-65 degrees Celsius), under highly stringent conditions (e.g. hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6\u00d7 sodium chloride/Sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45 degrees Celsius, followed by one or more washes in 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.2% SDS at about 68 degrees Celsius), or under other stringent hybridization conditions which are known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds., 1989 Current Protocol in Molecular Biology, Green publishing associates, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York, at pp. 6.3.1-6.3.6 and 2.10.3).",
                        "By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a query amino acid sequence, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino- or carboxy-terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.",
                        "As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence of a protein such as a Cas9 protein, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present disclosure) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245 (1990)). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is expressed as percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter.",
                        "If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present disclosure. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cwild type\u201d is a term of the art understood by skilled persons and means the typical form of an organism, strain, gene or characteristic as it occurs in nature as distinguished from mutant or variant forms.",

                        "The present disclosure provides adenine base editors that are variants of ABEmax that feature a significantly lower RNA editing footprint while retaining DNA editing fidelity. The disclosed adenine base editors that comprise an adenosine deaminase domain (e.g., a variant of an adenosine deaminase that deaminates deoxyadenosine in DNA as described herein) and a napDNAbp domain (e.g., a Cas9 protein) capable of binding to a specific nucleotide sequence. The deamination of an adenosine by an adenosine deaminase may lead to a point mutation from adenine (A) to guanine (G), a process referred to herein as base editing. For example, the adenosine may be converted to an inosine residue. Within the constraints of a DNA polymerase active site, inosine pairs most stably with C and therefore is read or replicated by the cell's replication machinery as a guanine (G). Such base editors are useful inter alia for targeted editing of nucleic acid sequences. Such base editors may be used for targeted editing of DNA in vitro, e.g., for the generation of mutant cells or animals. Such base editors may be used for for the introduction of targeted mutations, e.g., for the correction of genetic defects in cells ex vivo, e.g., in cells obtained from a subject that are subsequently re-introduced into the same or another subject, or for multiplexed editing of a genome. And these base editors may be used for the introduction of targeted mutations in vivo, e.g., the correction of genetic defects or the introduction of deactivating mutations in disease-associated genes in a subject, or for multiplexed editing of a genome. The adenine base editors described herein may be utilized for the targeted editing of G to A mutations (e.g., targeted genome editing). The disclosure provides deaminases, base editors, nucleic acids, vectors, cells, compositions, methods, kits, and uses that utilize the deaminases and base editors provided herein. In particular aspects, base editing methods comprising contacting a nucleic acid molecule with an adenine base editor and a guide RNA that has complementarity to a target sequence are disclosed; as well as kits and pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of ABE7.10 variants to a host cell.",
                        "ABE7.10 (ABEmax) was shown to generate detectable levels of widespread adenosine-to-inosine editing in cellular RNAs. Using structure-guided principles to design mutations in both deaminase domains, new ABE variants were developed that retain their ability to edit DNA efficiently but show greatly reduced off-target effects, such as reduced RNA editing activity, off-target DNA editing activity, and indel byproduct formation, in three mammalian cell lines.",
                        "Given the lack of an elucidated structure of ABE or of the E. coli TadA homodimer bound to RNA, the crystal structure of was used for targeted mutagenesis of wild-type E. coli TadA deaminases to design that reduce undesired RNA editing activity. S. aureus TadA has high sequence homology to E. coli TadA (25). Three TadA* residues were identified, predicted to interact with the RNA substrate as targets for substitutions that might impair TadA*-mediated RNA deamination. It was hypothesized that impeding the ability of TadA* to accommodate 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups that are present in RNA, but absent in DNA, by replacing these three amino acids with larger or more hydrophobic residues (Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met) could further improve the DNA versus RNA editing specificity of ABEmax comprising an adenosine deaminase domain comprising a mutated TadA(E59A) (or ABEmax(TadA(E59W)). Arginine 47 is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the substrate adenosine (FIG. 2A). Arg 47 was replaced in TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met in an effort to abrogate this interaction. A series of ABEmax mutants was generated with TadA* substitutions at either Aspartine 108 (FIG. 2B) or Valine 106 (FIG. 2C), two residues that are located close to the catalytic site of TadA, and that mutated from Asp 108 and Ala 106 during the evolution of TadA*(1). Aspartine 108 is predicted to directly hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the uridine immediately 5\u2032 of the substrate adenosine (FIG. 2B), and replacement of Alanine 106 might fill some of the space that accommodates this uridine, including its 2\u2032 hydroxyl group, with larger and more hydrophobic side chains (FIG. 2C). Asn 108 was replaced in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, Lys, or Met, and Val 106 in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met, in an effort to disrupt the ability of TadA* to accommodate ribonucleotides by eliminating the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds with 2\u2032 hydroxyl groups in RNA or by steric occlusion. An additional mutation of Aspartine 108 to lysine was also designed.",
                        "Using structure-guided mutagenesis approaches, ABE7.10 variants were designed with mutations in both TadA domains demonstrated greatly reduced RNA editing while maintaining efficient target DNA editing, improving DNA specificity, and reducing indel byproduct formation. An ABE7.10 variant comprising an adenosine deaminase domain comprising TadA(E59W) and TadA7.10(V106W) generated particularly low levels of off-target effects. TadA7.10(V106W) comprises the following substitutions in ecTadA: W23R, H36L, P48A, R51L, L84F, A106W, D108N, H123Y, S146C, D147Y, R152P, E155V, I156F, and K157N. Another ABE7.10 variant comprising an adenosine deaminase domain comprising TadA(E59W) and TadA7.10(N108W) generated particularly low levels of off-target effects. TadA7.10(N108W) comprises the following substitutions in ecTadA: W23R, H36L, P48A, R51L, L84F, A106V, D108W, H123Y, S146C, D147Y, R152P, E155V, I156F, and K157N.",
                        "Off-target activity may arise because of imperfect hybridization of the napDNAbp-guide RNA complex to sequences that share identity with the target sequence. Otherwise, off-target activity may occur independently of the napDNAbp-guide RNA complex arise as a result of stochastic binding of the adenine base editor to DNA sequences (often sequences that do not share high sequence identity with the target sequence) due to an intrinsic affinity of the base editor of the nucleotide modification domain (e.g., the deaminase domain) of the base editor with DNA. NapDNAbp-independent (e.g., Cas9-independent) editing events arise in particular when the base editor is overexpressed in the system under evaluation, such as a cell or a subject.",
                        "In the experiments described herein, A-to-I editing attributable to the overexpression of ABEmax, the most efficient ABE variant reported to date (15), was measured with high sensitivity. Targeted deep sequencing of individual abundant mRNA transcripts and transcriptome-wide RNA-seq techniques were utilized to demonstrate that ABEmax induced low levels of widespread adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing across the transcriptome. Comparison of RNA editing rates between ABEmax mutants with catalytically disabled deaminase domains revealed that both the wild-type E. coli TadA monomer that plays a structural role during base editing and laboratory-evolved E. coli TadA7.10 (TadA*) that catalyzes deoxyadenosine deamination contribute to RNA editing. This may represent the first recognition of off-target RNA editing in ABEmax and thus the first recognition of this deficiency in the art.",

The novel ABEmax variants disclosed herein provide average overall magnitudes of detectable RNA edits among the 182 total adenosines analyzed of as low as 26\u00b110, which is similar to the background of 12\u00b16 for Cas9 nickase alone and significantly reduced from an average of 94\u00b18 with ABEmax (see FIG. 2E). These editing frequencies were analyzed using high-throughput screening (HTS).",
                        "On a human cell transcriptome-wide basis, as analyzed by RNA-seq, the novel ABEmax variants disclosed herein provide average RNA editing frequencies as low as 0.14%, levels nearly equivalent to those observed from Cas9 nickase alone and represent a significant reduction compared with the 0.22% average RNA editing frequency of ABEmax (see FIGS. 2G, 2H). These novel ABEmax variants provide average overall detectable transcriptome edits of about 57,700 edits, levels similar to the background of 53,300 for Cas9 nickase alone and significantly lower (by 10,608 edits) than those ABEmax (see FIG. 2E).",
                        "Notably, the disclosed ABEmax variants retain, and in some cases show improved, the high DNA editing fidelity of ABEmax. These variants were shown to generate reduced indel formation (3.7-fold fewer indels) relative to ABEmax at seven target DNA loci, as analyzed by HTS (see FIGS. 4A-4D). These variants generated an average off-target DNA editing frequency as low as 0.79\u00b10.18%, a 2.7-fold improvement relative to ABEmax. These results may indicate an important correlation: Mutations that reduce the tolerance of ABEmax for RNA editing may also increase the DNA specificity of base editing, likely by reducing DNA binding interactions that support productive editing of off-target loci.",

In some embodiments, any of the Cas9 domains or Cas9 proteins (e.g., dCas9 or nCas9) provided herein may be fused with any of the adenosine deaminases provided herein. In some embodiments, the adenosine deaminase domain comprises a single adenosine deaminase enzyme. In other embodiments, the adenosine deaminase domain comprises two adenosine deaminases, e.g., a heterodimer of adenosine deaminases.",

As an example, diseases that may be treated by making an A to G, or a T to C mutation, may be treated using the base editors provided herein. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory certain anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, may be treated by inducing expression of hemoglobin, such as fetal hemoglobin, which is typically silenced in adults. As one example, mutating the thymine to a cytosine at position-198 in the promoter controlling HBG1 and/or HBG2 gene expression results in increased expression of the HBG1 and HBG2 proteins, respectively. Another example, a class of disorders that results from a G to A mutation in a gene is iron storage disorders, where the HFE gene comprises a G to A mutation that results in expression of a C282Y mutant HFE protein.

Inosine preferentially hydrogen bonds with C, resulting in an A to G mutation during DNA replication. When covalently tethered to Cas9 (or another nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein), the adenosine deaminase (e.g., ecTadA) is localized to a gene of interest and catalyzes A to G mutations in the ssDNA substrate.

The T may then be replaced with a C, for example by base excision repair mechanisms, or may be changed in subsequent rounds of DNA replication. Thus, the adenine base editors described herein may deaminate the A nucleobase to give a nucleotide sequence that is not associated with a disease or disorder. In some aspects, the adenine base editors described herein may be useful for deaminating an adenosine (A) nucleobase in a gene promoter. In some embodiments, deamination leads to induce transcription of the gene.

In other words, the guide nucleic-acid \u201cprograms\u201d the napDNAbp domain to localize and bind to a complementary sequence of the target strand. Binding of the napDNAbp domain to a complementary sequence enables the nucleobase modification domains (e.g., adenosine deaminase domain) of the base editor to access and enzymatically deaminate a target adenine base in the target strand.",
                                "The napDNAbp domain can be a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-associated nuclease. As outlined above, CRISPR is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). CRISPR clusters contain spacers, sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements, and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In type II CRISPR systems correct processing of pre-crRNA requires a trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA), endogenous ribonuclease 3 (mc) and a Cas9 protein. The tracrRNA serves as a guide for ribonuclease 3-aided processing of pre-crRNA. Subsequently, Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA endonucleolytically cleaves linear or circular dsDNA target complementary to the spacer. The target strand not complementary to crRNA is first cut endonucleolytically, then trimmed 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonucleolytically. In nature, DNA-binding and cleavage typically requires protein and both RNAs. However, single guide RNAs (\u201csgRNA\u201d, or simply \u201cgNRA\u201d) can be engineered so as to incorporate aspects of both the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single RNA species. See, e.g., Jinek et al., Science 337:816-821(2012), the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.",
                                "Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the binding mechanism of a napDNAbp-guide RNA complex, in general, includes the step of forming an R-loop whereby the napDNAbp induces the unwinding of a double-strand DNA target, thereby separating the strands in the region bound by the napDNAbp. The guideRNA protospacer then hybridizes to the \u201ctarget strand.\u201d This displaces a \u201cnon-target strand\u201d that is complementary to the target strand, which forms the single strand region of the R-loop. In some embodiments, the napDNAbp includes one or more nuclease activities, which cuts the DNA leaving various types of lesions (e.g., a nick in one strand of the DNA). For example, the napDNAbp may comprises a nuclease activity that cuts the non-target strand at a first location, and/or cuts the target strand at a second location. Depending on the nuclease activity, the target DNA can be cut to form a \u201cdouble-stranded break\u201d whereby both strands are cut. In other embodiments, the target DNA can be cut at only a single site, i.e., the DNA is \u201cnicked\u201d on one strand.",

In various embodiments, the napDNAbp has a nickase activity, i.e., only cleave one strand of the target DNA sequence. In other embodiments, the napDNAbp has an inactive nuclease, e.g., are \u201cdead\u201d proteins. Other variant Cas9 proteins that may be used are those having a smaller molecular weight than the canonical SpCas9 (e.g., for easier delivery) or having modified or rearranged primary amino acid sequence (e.g., the circular permutant forms).

                                "In some embodiments, the napDNAbp is a single effector of a microbial CRISPR-Cas system. Single effectors of microbial CRISPR-Cas systems include, without limitation, Cas9, Cpf1, C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3. Typically, microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 systems. Class 1 systems have multisubunit effector complexes, while Class 2 systems have a single protein effector. For example, Cas9 and Cpf1 are Class 2 effectors. In addition to Cas9 and Cpf1, three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems (C2c1, C2c2, and C2c3) have been described by Shmakov et al., \u201cDiscovery and Functional Characterization of Diverse Class 2 CRISPR Cas Systems\u201d, Mol. Cell, 2015 Nov. 5; 60(3): 385-397, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Effectors of two of the systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains related to Cpf1. A third system, C2c2 contains an effector with two predicated HEPN RNase domains. Production of mature CRISPR RNA is tracrRNA-independent, unlike production of CRISPR RNA by C2c1. C2c1 depends on both CRISPR RNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Bacterial C2c2 has been shown to possess a unique RNase activity for CRISPR RNA maturation distinct from its RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These RNase functions are different from each other and from the CRISPR RNA-processing behavior of Cpf1. See, e.g., East-Seletsky, et al., \u201cTwo distinct RNase activities of CRISPR-C2c2 enable guide-RNA processing and RNA detection\u201d, Nature, 2016 Oct. 13; 538(7624):270-273, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In vitro biochemical analysis of C2c2 in Leptotrichia shahii has shown that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programed to cleave ssRNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. Catalytic residues in the two conserved HEPN domains mediate cleavage. Mutations in the catalytic residues generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins.

In various embodiments, the Cas9 or Cas9 variants have a nickase activity, i.e., only cleave of strand of the target DNA sequence. In other embodiments, the Cas9 or Cas9 variants have inactive nucleases, i.e., are \u201cdead\u201d Cas9 proteins. Other variant Cas9 proteins that may be used are those having a smaller molecular weight than the canonical SpCas9 (e.g., for easier delivery) or having modified or rearranged primary amino acid structure (e.g., the circular permutant formats). The base editors described herein may also comprise Cas9 equivalents, including Cas12a/Cpf1 and Cas12b proteins which are the result of convergent evolution. The napDNAbps used herein (e.g., SpCas9, Cas9 variant, or Cas9 equivalents) may also may also contain various modifications that alter/enhance their PAM specifities. Lastly, the application contemplates any Cas9, Cas9 variant, or Cas9 equivalent which has at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.9% sequence identity to a reference Cas9 sequence, such as a references SpCas9 canonical sequences or a reference Cas9 equivalent (e.g., Cas12a/Cpf1).",

                                "In addition, any available methods may be utilized to obtain or construct a variant or mutant Cas9 protein. The term \u201cmutation,\u201d as used herein, refers to a substitution of a residue within a sequence, e.g., a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence, with another residue, or a deletion or insertion of one or more residues within a sequence. Mutations are typically described herein by identifying the original residue followed by the position of the residue within the sequence and by the identity of the newly substituted residue. Various methods for making the amino acid substitutions (mutations) provided herein are well known in the art, and are provided by, for example, Green and Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (4th ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2012)). Mutations can include a variety of categories, such as single base polymorphisms, microduplication regions, indel, and inversions, and is not meant to be limiting in any way. Mutations can include \u201closs-of-function\u201d mutations which is the normal result of a mutation that reduces or abolishes a protein activity. Most loss-of-function mutations are recessive, because in a heterozygote the second chromosome copy carries an unmutated version of the gene coding for a fully functional protein whose presence compensates for the effect of the mutation. Mutations also embrace \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutations, which is one which confers an abnormal activity on a protein or cell that is otherwise not present in a normal condition. Many gain-of-function mutations are in regulatory sequences rather than in coding regions, and can therefore have a number of consequences. For example, a mutation might lead to one or more genes being expressed in the wrong tissues, these tissues gaining functions that they normally lack. Because of their nature, gain-of-function mutations are usually dominant.",
                                "Mutations can be introduced into a reference Cas9 protein using site-directed mutagenesis. Older methods of site-directed mutagenesis known in the art rely on sub-cloning of the sequence to be mutated into a vector, such as an M13 bacteriophage vector, that allows the isolation of single-stranded DNA template. In these methods, one anneals a mutagenic primer (i.e., a primer capable of annealing to the site to be mutated but bearing one or more mismatched nucleotides at the site to be mutated) to the single-stranded template and then polymerizes the complement of the template starting from the 3\u2032 end of the mutagenic primer. The resulting duplexes are then transformed into host bacteria and plaques are screened for the desired mutation. More recently, site-directed mutagenesis has employed PCR methodologies, which have the advantage of not requiring a single-stranded template. In addition, methods have been developed that do not require sub-cloning. Several issues must be considered when PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis is performed. First, in these methods it is desirable to reduce the number of PCR cycles to prevent expansion of undesired mutations introduced by the polymerase. Second, a selection must be employed in order to reduce the number of non-mutated parental molecules persisting in the reaction. Third, an extended-length PCR method is preferred in order to allow the use of a single PCR primer set. And fourth, because of the non-template-dependent terminal extension activity of some thermostable polymerases it is often necessary to incorporate an end-polishing step into the procedure prior to blunt-end ligation of the PCR-generated mutant product.",

The term \u201cRNA editing effects,\u201d as used herein, refers to the introduction of modifications (e.g. deaminations) of nucleotides within cellular RNA, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA).

RNA editing may be measured by techniques known in the art, including high-throughput screening of sequencing reads and RNA-seq.

                                "In general, a tracr mate sequence includes any sequence that has sufficient complementarity with a tracr sequence to promote one or more of: (1) excision of a guide sequence flanked by tracr mate sequences in a cell containing the corresponding tracr sequence; and (2) formation of a complex at a target sequence, wherein the complex comprises the tracr mate sequence hybridized to the tracr sequence. In general, degree of complementarity is with reference to the optimal alignment of the tracr mate sequence and tracr sequence, along the length of the shorter of the two sequences. Optimal alignment may be determined by any suitable alignment algorithm, and may further account for secondary structures, such as self-complementarity within either the tracr sequence or tracr mate sequence. In some embodiments, the degree of complementarity between the tracr sequence and tracr mate sequence along the length of the shorter of the two when optimally aligned is about or more than about 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or higher. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence is about or more than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence and tracr mate sequence are contained within a single transcript, such that hybridization between the two produces a transcript having a secondary structure, such as a hairpin. Preferred loop forming sequences for use in hairpin structures are four nucleotides in length, and most preferably have the sequence GAAA. However, longer or shorter loop sequences may be used, as may alternative sequences. The sequences preferably include a nucleotide triplet (for example, AAA), and an additional nucleotide (for example C or G). Examples of loop forming sequences include CAAA and AAAG. In an embodiment of the disclosure, the transcript or transcribed polynucleotide sequence has at least two or more hairpins. In certain embodiments, the transcript has two, three, four or five hairpins. In a further embodiment of the disclosure, the transcript has at most five hairpins. In some embodiments, the single transcript further includes a transcription termination sequence; preferably this is a polyT sequence, for example six T nucleotides. Further non-limiting examples of single polynucleotides comprising a guide sequence, a tracr mate sequence, and a tracr sequence are as follows (listed 5\u2032 to 3\u2032), where \u201cN\u201d represents a base of a guide sequence, the first block of lower case letters represent the tracr mate sequence, and the second block of lower case letters represent the tracr sequence, and the final poly-T sequence represents the transcription terminator:",

                                "In some embodiments, the base editors (or a component thereof) is codon optimized for expression in particular cells, such as eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cells may be those of or derived from a particular organism, such as a mammal, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, or non-human primate. In general, codon optimization refers to a process of modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the host cells of interest by replacing at least one codon (e.g. about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more codons) of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host cell while maintaining the native amino acid sequence. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. Codon bias (differences in codon usage between organisms) often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, among other things, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. Codon usage tables are readily available, for example, at the \u201cCodon Usage Database\u201d, and these tables can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura, Y., et al. \u201cCodon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000\u201d Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292 (2000). Computer algorithms for codon optimizing a particular sequence for expression in a particular host cell are also available, such as Gene Forge (Aptagen; Jacobus, Pa.), are also available. In some embodiments, one or more codons (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more, or all codons) in a sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme correspond to the most frequently used codon for a particular amino acid.",
                                "In other embodiments, the base editors of the disclosure have improved expression (as compared to non-modified or state of the art counterpart editors) as a result of ancestral sequence reconstruction analysis. Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is the process of analyzing modern sequences within an evolutionary/phylogenetic context to infer the ancestral sequences at particular nodes of a tree. These ancient sequences are most often then synthesized, recombinantly expressed in laboratory microorganisms or cell lines, and then characterized to reveal the ancient properties of the extinct biomolecules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This process has produced tremendous insights into the mechanisms of molecular adaptation and functional divergence7. Despite such insights, a major criticism of ASR is the general inability to benchmark accuracy of the implemented algorithms. It is difficult to benchmark ASR for many reasons. Notably, genetic material is not preserved in fossils on a long enough time scale to satisfy most ASR studies (many millions to billions of years ago), and it is not yet physically possible to travel back in time to collect samples. Reference is made to Cal et al., \u201cReconstruction of ancestral protein sequences and its applications,\u201d BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:33 and Zakas et al., \u201cEnhancing the pharmaceutical properties of protein drugs by ancestral sequence reconstruction,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 35, pp. 35-37 (2017), each of which are incorporated herein by reference.",

                                "The tropism of a viruses can be altered by incorporating foreign envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system would therefore depend on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immuno deficiency virus (SIV), human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., J.

Virol. 65:2220-2224 (1991); PCT/US94/05700). In applications where transient expression is preferred, adenoviral based systems may be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus (\u201cAAV\u201d) vectors may also be used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures (see, e.g., West et al., Virology 160:38-47 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368; WO 93/24641; Kotin, Human Gene Therapy 5:793-801 (1994); Muzyczka, J. Clin. Invest. 94:1351 (1994). Construction of recombinant AAV vectors are described in a number of publications, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,414; Tratschin et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3251-3260 (1985); Tratschin, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 4:2072-2081 (1984); Hermonat & Muzyczka, PNAS 81:6466-6470 (1984); and Samulski et al., J. Virol. 63:03822-3828 (1989).",
                                "Packaging cells are typically used to form virus particles that are capable of infecting a host cell. Such cells include 293 cells, which package adenovirus, and \u03c82 cells or PA317 cells, which package retrovirus. Viral vectors used in gene therapy are usually generated by producing a cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a viral particle. The vectors typically contain the minimal viral sequences required for packaging and subsequent integration into a host, other viral sequences being replaced by an expression cassette for the polynucleotide(s) to be expressed. The missing viral functions are typically supplied in trans by the packaging cell line. For example, AAV vectors used in gene therapy typically only possess ITR sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and integration into the host genome. Viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but lacking ITR sequences. The cell line may also be infected with adenovirus as a helper. The helper virus promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes from the helper plasmid. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by, e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV. Additional methods for the delivery of nucleic acids to cells are known to those skilled in the art.

One such solution is formulating the editor fused to split intein pairs that are packaged into two separate rAAV particles that, when co-delivered to a cell, reconstitute the functional editor protein. Several other special considerations to account for the unique features of base editing are described, including the optimization of second-site nicking targets and properly packaging fusion proteins into virus vectors, including lentiviruses and rAAV.",

                                "In the Examples discussed below, the widespread, low-level cellular RNA editing from adenine base editors was identified, that was greatly reduced, without substantially sacrificing on-target DNA editing, by introducing the E59A or E59Q mutation into TadA and the V106W mutation in TadA*. In addition to decoupling DNA and RNA editing activities, the ABEmaxAW variant substantially reduced off-target DNA editing activity and the formation of indel byproducts. Although it is noted that even ABEmax-mediated RNA editing is both low-level (averaging 0.21% across all transcripts) and transient given the short half-life of most cellular RNAs (27, 29), the extent to which low-level RNA editing may interfere with base editing biological studies or therapeutics development efforts will depend strongly on features of the specific applications, including the duration of exposure to the base editor.

                                "HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing ABEmax and isolating genomic DNA and RNA after 48 hours. After cDNA generation from poly-adenylated cellular mRNA, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was performed on 220- to 250-nt regions of three mRNA amplicons: CTNNB1, IP90, and RSL1D1. CTNNB1 and IP90 were chosen as two examples of abundant mRNAs in HEK293T cells, and RSL1D1 was studied because it contains a region highly homologous to the 20-nt region of E. coli tRNAArg2 that is the native substrate of TadA(26). The TadA minimal substrate sequence is GCUCGGCUCGAACCGAG (SEQ ID NO: 1), while the homologous region of RSL1D1 mRNA is agUCGGCUCGGAAuuuAG (SEQ ID NO: 2), where upper-case letters indicate sequence identity. In all three transcripts, ABEmax generated low but detectable levels of RNA editing above the endogenous level of A-to-I editing from cellular deaminases(27, 29), which was measured using a Cas9(D10A)-only control. ABEmax expression increased both the extent of A-to-I conversions throughout the transcript (FIG. 1C), measured by the number of sequenced adenosines with an A-to-I conversion frequency >0.10%, as well as the magnitude of A-to-I editing (FIG. 1D), measured by the average percentage of A-to-I conversion at every sequenced adenosine. For example, ABEmax generated an average of 1.3\u00b10.41% A-to-I conversion among all sequenced adenosines in RSL1D1 mRNA, a 22-fold increase relative to the Cas9(D10A) nickase-only control that averaged 0.060\u00b10.010% A-to-I conversion in the same transcript. Likewise, ABEmax resulted in detectable deamination of 27\u00b12 out of 46 adenosines sequenced in RSL1D1 mRNA, while the Cas9(D10A) nickase control resulted in detectable deamination of 7\u00b11 (3.9-fold fewer) of these 46 adenosines (FIGS. 1C, 1D). To test if RNA editing activity requires fusion with the Cas9 component of the base editor, the TadA-TadA* monomer was overexpressed in trans with Cas9(D10A) nickase or dead Cas9 (dCas9) and observed substantial RNA editing under these conditions at all three tested transcripts (FIGS. 1C, 1D). This outcome confirmed that RNA editing activity arises from the unassisted binding of TadA domains to cellular RNA, and focused efforts to improve the DNA:RNA specificity of ABE on engineering these deaminases. Taken together, these results establish that the TadA-TadA* deaminase component of ABEmax mediates low levels of cellular RNA editing.",
                                "Glu 70 is a critical catalytic residue in E. coli TadA, and the TadA E70A mutant either alone(26) or in ABE(1) has no deaminase activity. In the soluble, N-terminally truncated version of TadA(26) used in ABE(1), Glu 70 corresponds to Glu 59, and will be referred to as Glu 59 hereafter. To identify which TadA monomers mediate RNA editing in ABEmax, inactivating E59A mutations were introduced into either the TadA or TadA* monomer of ABEmax and RNA (FIGS. 1C, 1D) and DNA (FIG. 1E) editing activity of the resulting variants was measured. Installing the E59A mutation in the wild-type TadA monomer to generate ABEmax(TadA E59A) modestly reduced the average number of edited adenosines in all three tested transcripts relative to ABEmax (FIG. 1C). Despite the modest reduction in RNA editing activity associated with ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmax(TadA E59A) maintains high DNA base editing activity similar to that of ABEmax. ABEmax averaged 46.6\u00b13.9% DNA editing across the seven endogenous genomic sites tested, chosen because they result in a wide range of ABEmax editing efficiencies (from 85\u00b16.6% to 4.5\u00b10.70%), while ABEmax(TadA E59A) averaged 41.5\u00b15.4% DNA editing at the same sites (FIG. 1E). ABEmax(TadA E59A) also displayed reduced indel formation at these seven genomic sites compared to ABEmax (FIGS. 4A-4D), from a mean of 2.3\u00b10.39% with ABEmax to 1.1\u00b10.24% with ABEmax(TadA E59A). These data suggest that inactivation of the catalytic domain in the wild-type TadA monomer can reduce off-target RNA editing and indel formation without substantially sacrificing on-target DNA editing efficiency.",
                                "By contrast, neither ABEmax(TadA* E59A) nor ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A) edit RNA (FIGS. 1C, 1D) or DNA (FIG. 1E), with one notable exception: ABEmax(TadA* E59A), which contains a wild-type TadA monomer but an inactivated evolved TadA* monomer, edits RSL1D1 mRNA at position 152, the adenosine that is highly homologous to that of TadA's native tRNAArg substrate (FIG. 1F). Together, these data indicate that both wild-type TadA and TadA* in ABEmax can deaminate RNA in a Cas9-independent manner. This off-target RNA editing activity may be reduced by inactivating the wild-type TadA monomer, but residual RNA editing activity remains from TadA*, which cannot be inactivated without abolishing DNA editing activity (FIG. 1D).",
                                "To test if these findings apply to many different cellular transcripts, transcriptome-wide analysis was performed of HEK293T cells treated with ABEmax, ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmax(TadA* E59A), and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A). Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the base editor and an LDLR-targeting sgRNA. Targeting the base editors to an expressed gene mimics their typical use (3) and enables detection of the on-target U-to-C edit in the corresponding LDLR mRNA transcript during transcriptome-wide RNA-Seq as an internal positive control (FIG. 1G). Since A-to-I editing in cellular mRNA from endogenous ADAR deaminases is a common source of natural RNA editing in metazoans (27, 29), cells treated with Cas9(D10A) nickase were used only as a control to identify A-to-I RNA editing levels from endogenous cellular deaminases.",
                                "Transcriptome-wide RNA-seq data revealed that, on average, ABEmax overexpression induced 14,959 additional high-confidence A-to-I edits compared to the Cas9 nickase-only control (FIG. 1H). Although ABEmax overexpression adds only 28% more detected A-to-I edits than the 53,334 endogenous cellular A-to-I edits observed in the Cas9 nickase-only control, these additional ABEmax-induced RNA edits were widespread throughout the transcriptome, including 10,335 transcripts not edited in the Cas9 nickase-only control samples. These data confirm that low-level RNA editing is widespread throughout the transcriptome among cells overexpressing ABEmax.",
                                "RNA editing across the transcriptome was reduced by inactivating either TadA or TadA* monomers. Catalytically inactivated ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A) resulted in 53,917 A-to-I edits, similar to the 53,334 A-to-I edits detected in the Cas9 nickase-only control. ABEmax(TadA E59A) resulted in 12,142 more A-to-I edits than the Cas9 nickase-only control, 19% fewer additional A-to-I edits than the 14,959 mediated by ABEmax (FIG. 1H). The average A-to-I RNA editing frequency across all transcripts was 0.22% for ABEmax, 0.19% for ABEmax(TadA E59A), and 0.13% for Cas9(D10A) nickase only (FIG. 1I). Together, these findings indicate that transcriptome-wide RNA editing is modestly reduced by inactivating the wild-type TadA monomer in ABEmax.",
                                "Given the lack of an elucidated structure of ABE or of the E. coli TadA homodimer bound to RNA, the crystal structure of S. aureus TadA was used, which has high sequence homology to E. coli TadA (25), to guide the design of ABE mutants that further reduce RNA editing. Starting with ABEmax(TadA E59A), the construct with the inactivated wild-type TadA domain that shows reduced RNA editing but maintains strong DNA base editing (FIGS. 1C-1H), mutations were installed into the evolved TadA* monomer."

                                "Three TadA* residues were identified, predicted to interact with the RNA substrate as targets for substitutions that might impair TadA*-mediated RNA deamination. It was hypothesized that impeding the ability of TadA* to accommodate 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups that are present in RNA, but absent in DNA, by replacing these three amino acids with larger or more hydrophobic residues (Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met) could further improve the DNA versus RNA editing specificity of ABEmax(TadA E59A). Arg 47 is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the substrate adenosine (FIG. 2A). Arg 47 was replaced in TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met in an effort to abrogate this interaction. A series of ABEmax mutants was also generated with TadA* substitutions at either Asn 108 (FIG. 2B) or Val 106 (FIG. 2C), two residues that are located close to the catalytic site of TadA, and that mutated from Asp 108 and Ala 106 during the evolution of TadA*(1). Asp 108 is predicted to directly hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the uridine immediately 5\u2032 of the substrate adenosine (FIG. 2B), and replacement of Ala 106 might fill some of the space that accommodates this uridine, including its 2\u2032 hydroxyl group, with larger and more hydrophobic side chains (FIG. 2C). Asn 108 was replaced in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, Lys, or Met, and Val 106 in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met, in an effort to disrupt the ability of TadA* to accommodate ribonucleotides by eliminating the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds with 2\u2032 hydroxyl groups in RNA or by steric occlusion. An additional Asn 108 Lys mutation was also tested to provide a polar side-chain that is incapable of serving as a hydrogen bond acceptor assuming protonation at physiological pH.",
                                "HEK293T cells were transfected with each of these 13 ABEmax(TadA E59A) mutants and measured the resulting on-target DNA A.T-to-G.C base editing at the seven genomic loci tested (FIG. 2D). High-throughput sequencing of regions of IP90, RSL1D1, and CTNNB1 cDNAs was used to rapidly assess the RNA editing activities of these 13 mutants in HEK293T cells (FIGS. 2E, 2F) prior to transcriptome-wide RNA-seq analyses.",
                                "Replacing TadA* Arg 47 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) with Gln, Met, Phe or Trp maintained relatively high DNA base editing efficiency, particularly at sites where the target A is at protospacer position 5 (counting the PAM as positions 21-23). Average editing efficiencies were reduced from a mean of 47\u00b13.9% for ABEmax(TadA E59A) to a range of 31-41% for the four TadA* Arg 47 variants. Among the four Arg 47 mutants tested, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47M) and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47Q), the most efficient variants for DNA base editing, showed little or no reduction in RNA editing activity compared to ABEmax(TadA E59A) (FIGS. 2E, 2F). The two variants in which Arg 47 was replaced with larger and more rigid hydrophobic residues, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47F) and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47W), resulted in up to a 2.0-fold reduction in the number of edited adenosines in the interrogated transcripts (FIG. 2E). Unfortunately, this reduction in RNA editing was accompanied by a similar reduction in DNA editing at sgRNAs in which the target A was located at positions other than position 5 in the protospacer (FIG. 2D). These data indicate that replacing Arg 47 with Phe or Trp impairs both RNA and DNA editing and replacing this residue with Met or Gln impairs neither DNA nor RNA editing.",
                                "Mutation of TadA* Asn 108 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) generally preserved DNA base editing at sites in which the target A was at protospacer position 5, but greatly reduced DNA editing at other target sites. The most active Asn 108 mutant, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108K), mediated 25\u00b10.2% average on-target DNA editing (FIG. 2D), a 1.9-fold reduction compared to ABEmax, but also exhibited the highest levels of RNA editing among the Asn 108 mutants assayed (FIG. 2E and FIG. 2F). Mutation of TadA* Asn 108 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) to Phe, Trp, Gln or Met greatly reduced RNA editing compared to ABEmax in the three transcripts sequenced at depth to levels statistically indistinguishable from background RNA editing observed in the Cas9(D10A)-only controls (Student's two-tailed T test, p>0.05 for comparisons between number of edited adenosines in each transcript) (FIG. 2E). Together, these data indicate that Asn 108 in TadA* is important for efficient DNA base editing at protospacer positions beyond the most preferred one (position 5), and is also essential for RNA editing. The ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108Q) or ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108W) variants may be useful when the target A is at protospacer position 5, and minimizing RNA editing is critical.",
                                "Substitution of TadA* Val 106 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) resulted in variants that exhibited much lower RNA editing while maintaining DNA editing levels similar to those of ABEmax(TadA E59A) and ABEmax. All four Val 106 mutants mediated effective DNA base editing across the seven genomic loci tested; the most efficient DNA base editor among these mutants was ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* V106W), hereafter referred to as ABEmaxAW, which yielded an average of 36\u00b11.4% A.T-to-G.C DNA editing (compared to 41\u00b15.4% for ABEmax(TadA E59A), and 47\u00b13.9% for ABEmax). ABEmaxAW exhibited both the highest level of DNA base editing and the lowest level of RNA off-target editing amongst the Val 106 mutants tested (FIGS. 2E, 2F). Analysis of the RNA isolated from cells transfected with ABEmaxAW indicated that the number of detectable A-to-I edits among the regions of the three transcripts analyzed was significantly reduced from an average of 94\u00b18 (out of 182 total adenosines) with ABEmax to 26\u00b110 with ABEmaxAW, similar to the background of 12\u00b16 for Cas9 nickase alone (FIG. 2E). The average magnitude of A-to-I edits was also greatly reduced in cells treated with ABEmaxAW (0.068% average A-to-I editing frequency among 182 total adenosines) to levels approaching those observed from Cas9 nickase alone (0.041% average), a 7.2-fold reduction compared with the 0.49% average A-to-I editing frequency of ABEmax (FIG. 2F). These findings establish that ABEmaxAW greatly reduces off-target RNA editing while preserving most of the on-target DNA editing activity of ABEmax."

                                "The applicability of the findings was tested to other mammalian cell types. First, the DNA base editing activities of ABEmax, ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmaxAW, and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108W) in HeLa cells (FIGS. 5A-5B), and ABEmax and ABEmaxAW in U2OS and K562 cells (FIGS. 6A-6F) were compared. DNA base editing efficiencies among unsorted HeLa and U2OS cells were uniformly lower than in HEK293T cells (FIG. 5A), possibly due to poorer transfection or nucleofection efficiencies(15). The DNA base editing activity of ABEmaxAW relative to ABEmax and ABEmax(TadA E59A), however, generally remained similar in all three cell types (FIGS. 5A, 6A). Next, RNA editing frequencies and magnitudes were investigated in U2OS and K562 cells, and it was found that compared to ABEmax, the use of ABEmaxAW greatly reduced RNA editing to levels indistinguishable from those of the Cas9(D10A) control (FIGS. 6C and 6D). Together, these data indicate that ABEmaxAW can mitigate RNA editing in multiple mammalian cell types.",
                                "The effect of longer exposure time to ABEmax or ABEmaxAW in HEK293T cells was assessed by harvesting cells 5 days post-transfection, instead of 48 hours. This change increased the average DNA base editing associated with both ABEmax and ABEmaxAW by 1.1-fold, to 52\u00b12.7% for ABEmax and 39\u00b11.7% with ABEmaxAW (FIGS. 7A, 7B). Surprisingly, average RNA editing was reduced compared to the 48-hour treatment; ABEmax yielded 0.29\u00b10.063% A-to-I average editing across the 182 adenosines sequenced (compared with 0.49\u00b10.13% at 48 hours). The average frequency of A-to-I mutation with ABEmaxAW after 5 days (0.074\u00b10.014%, 3.9-fold lower than that of ABEmax) remained close to the background frequency associated with Cas9(D10A) nickase alone of 0.051\u00b10.010% (FIGS. 7C, 7D). It is believed that the steady loss (or silencing) of transfected plasmids expressing base editors, coupled with the constant degradation and replenishment of the transcriptome, may result in lower RNA editing rates at longer time points.",
                                "These TadA* mutations might further weaken the ability of ABEmax variants to bind off-target DNA sequences that are already more weakly bound by Cas9. To test this possibility, the levels of off-target DNA editing were measured by ABEmax and a subset of the ABEmax variants described above. HTS was used to assess the frequencies of off-target A.T-to-G.C base editing and indel formation at 12 known off-target sites associated with HEK site 2, HEK site 3 and HEK site 4(31) (FIGS. 8, 9, 10). Among these 12 off-target sites, ten had at least one adenosine within the canonical ABE editing window (from protospacer position 4 to 8)(1, 3). The mean A.T-to-G.C editing efficiency at these ten candidate off-target loci from ABEmax was 2.1\u00b10.22%, similar to that of ABEmax(TadA E59A) (2.0\u00b10.28%) (FIGS. 8, 9, 10). Notably, ABEmaxAW generated an average off-target editing frequency of 0.79\u00b10.18%, a 2.5-fold improvement compared to ABEmax(TadA E59A), and a 2.7-fold improvement relative to ABEmax. Collectively, these results indicate that mutations that reduce the tolerance of ABEmax for RNA editing also increase the DNA specificity of base editing, likely by reducing DNA binding interactions that support productive editing of off-target loci.",
                                "Notably, ABEmaxAW also generated 3.7-fold fewer indels than ABEmax at the seven on-target DNA loci tested (from an average of 2.3\u00b10.39% with ABEmax to 0.62\u00b10.0069% with ABEmaxAW (FIGS. 4A-4D). The reason for this reduced indel frequency is unclear, but it is hypothesized that indel formation may be dependent on the structure or activity of the wild-type TadA monomer. Consistent with this hypothesis, ABEmax(TadA E59A) also shows reduced average indel formation (1.1\u00b10.24%) and ABEmax(TadA* E59A), which cannot perform DNA base editing, induces indels at an elevated frequency of 4.3\u00b10.45% (FIGS. 4A-4D)."

ABEmaxEW displayed slightly higher DNA on-target editing frequencies than ABEmaxAW (FIG. 11A), but also greater indel (FIG. 11B) and RNA editing frequencies (FIGS. 11C, 11D), confirming that mutation of both the wild-type and the evolved TadA monomers is required for the most effective reduction in RNA editing and indel frequencies. ABEmaxQW performed as well as or slightly better than ABEmaxAW at on-target DNA base editing (FIG. 11A) and displayed similarly low levels of off-target RNA editing (FIGS. 11C, 11D). Consistent with observations that the wild-type TadA monomer plays a role in indel formation, both ABEmaxEW and ABEmaxQW displayed substantially higher indel frequencies than ABEmaxAW (FIG. 11B). These comparisons together indicate that both inactivation of the wild-type TadA and mutation of the evolved monomer with V106W, are required to minimize off-target RNA editing, and ABEmaxQW may display higher on-target base editing efficiency at some sites than ABEmaxAW, but without the consistently lower indel frequencies of ABEmaxAW."

                                "Finally, RNA-Seq was performed to identify transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing frequencies associated with ABEmaxAW. Importantly, robust on-target DNA editing activity was confirmed in the RNA-seq samples treated with ABEmax, ABEmax(E59A), and ABEmaxAW by observing substantial U-to-C mutation in the LDLR mRNA, which resulted from base editing the corresponding genomic DNA site directed by the LDLR-targeting sgRNA (FIG. 2G). While the proportion of edited LDLR mRNA reads is reduced in the ABEmaxAW sample (24/90, 27%) as compared to the ABEmax (37/98, 38%) and ABEmax(TadA E59A) (18/66, 27%), the numbers of LDLR mRNA transcripts aligned to the reference sequence are low, making precise quantitation challenging. Consistent with the above results analyzing the three test transcripts in depth, ABEmaxAW only slightly elevated the number of A-to-I edits (57,685) beyond those observed in the Cas9(D10A) nickase-only control (53,334). ABEmaxAW thus resulted in substantially fewer transcriptome edits compared to ABEmax or ABEmax(E59A) (10,608 fewer A-to-I edits than ABEmax, and 7,791 fewer than ABEmax(E59A)) (FIGS. 2G, 2H). The average A-to-I RNA editing frequency was also compared across all transcripts, and it was found that the 0.22% average A-to-I RNA editing for ABEmax was reduced to 0.14% for ABEmaxAW and to 0.13% for the Cas9(D10A) nickase-only control (FIG. 2I). These findings confirm that ABEmaxAW maintains strong DNA base editing activity while exhibiting much lower transcriptome-wide RNA editing compared to ABEmax.",
                                "In order to determine the potential biological significance of the A-to-I edits observed with ABEmax and ABEmaxAW, the ENSEMBLE Variant Effector Predictor was used to determine where the edits were located within mRNA transcripts in the transcriptome-wide sequencing data (FIG. 3A). The RNA editing associated with ABEmax was spread across the transcriptome and not localized to particular regions (FIG. 12). Only 4.2% of the A-to-I edits were in a protein coding region; of these, 69% lead to coding changes (FIG. 3B). Next, SIFT was used to predict the impact of these coding changes on protein function, revealing that 58% of the coding A-to-I mutations are predicted to have a deleterious impact on protein function (FIG. 3C). In total ABEmax induced 1,138 A-to-I mutations predicted to be deleterious to protein function, compared to 535 for Cas9(D10A) alone. This was reduced to 727 for ABEmaxAW (FIG. 3C). Mutations in the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 UTR can also be deleterious to protein function, but the effects of such mutations are not readily predictable(30). Finally, it is noted that the biological consequence even of mutations that genuinely impair protein function are likely to be minimized by the very low average A-to-I RNA editing frequency of 0.21% for ABEmax, and 0.14% for ABEmaxAW, compared to 0.13% for the Cas9(D10A) nickase-only control."

Sam alignments were created using HISAT2 to align paired reads from each of three biological replicates to the hg38 human reference genome (UCSC). Precomputed HISAT2 indexes where obtained from ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml. The resulting sam files were sorted and indexed using the samtools software package. Sorted bam alignments from three biological replicates were combined using samtools in order to increase coverage and provide high-quality variant calls. Combined barns were randomly down-sampled to 120 million aligned reads for each condition using a random number generator. The standard error of the mean was found by repeated random down-sampling (from the total number of aligned reads to 120 million aligned reads) and measuring the spread in the variant calling results, which arise from different random sampling events.",

Thus the variant calling performed here considers read depth at a specific adenosine, number of edited reads at that position, mapping quality, and base call quality, and using all of these indicators, returns the probability that there is bona fide RNA editing at that given adenosine.",
