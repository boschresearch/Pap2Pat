                "Base editors enable the precise installation of targeted point mutations in genomic DNA without creating double-stranded DNA breaks (1\u20133). Adenine base editors (ABEs) convert a target A\u2022T base pair to a G\u2022C base pair (1). Because the mutation of G\u2022C base pairs to A\u2022T base pairs is the primary form of de novo mutation (4), ABEs have the potential to correct almost half of known human pathogenic point mutations (5). The original ABE, ABE7.10, can perform remarkably clean and efficient A\u2022T-to-G\u2022C conversion in DNA with very low levels of undesirable by-products such as small insertions or deletions (indels) in cultured cells (1, 6\u20138), adult mice (8, 9), plants (10), and other organisms (11\u201313). The efficiency of base editors was recently improved through codon and nuclear localization sequence optimization (6, 14) to generate ABEmax (6).",
                "Off-target base editing can arise from guide RNA\u2013dependent or guide RNA\u2013independent editing events (1, 3, 15\u201318). The former results from RNA-guided binding of the Cas9 domain to DNA sites that are similar, but not identical, to the target DNA locus (7, 8, 15, 18\u201321). Guide RNA\u2013dependent off-target base editing (15, 18) can be greatly reduced through strategies including installation of mutations that increase DNA specificity into the Cas9 component of base editors (18, 20, 22), adding 5\u2032-guanosine nucleotides to the single guide RNA (sgRNA) (18), or delivery of the base editor as a ribonucleoprotein complex (18, 20, 22). Guide RNA\u2013independent off-target editing can arise from binding of the deaminase domain of a base editor to C or A bases in a Cas9-independent manner (3, 16, 17). Recent studies characterized guide RNA\u2013independent off-target DNA editing activity of BE3, the original CBE (cytosine base editor), in mouse embryos (17) and in rice (16). In contrast to BE3, ABE7.10 in these studies did not result in detectable guide RNA\u2013independent off-target DNA mutations (16, 17).",
                "All ABEs reported to date are single polypeptide chains containing three fused protein components: a wild-type Escherichia coli TadA (tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase) monomer that plays a structural role during base editing, a laboratory-evolved E. coli TadA monomer (TadA*) that catalyzes deoxyadenosine deamination, and a Cas9(D10A) nickase (1, 3) (Fig. 1A). E. coli TadA natively acts as a homodimer to deaminate an adenosine located in a transfer RNA (tRNA) anticodon loop (23), generating inosine (I). We hypothesized that the wild-type TadA monomer, which natively acts on RNA but has strict sequence requirements (23, 24), and/or the evolved TadA* monomer, which we evolved to accept single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a substrate and to have broad sequence compatibility, may be able to catalyze the deamination of cellular RNA (Fig. 1B) (1, 3). While we previously observed no substantial ABE7.10-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells among a handful of abundant transcripts sequenced at modest depth (1), the association of elevated endogenous A-to-I editing in the transcriptome with disease (25) warranted a more comprehensive examination of possible ABE-mediated RNA editing. In particular, recent studies have identified aberrant A-to-I editing as a mechanism by which tumors can develop a resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (26).",
                "In this study, we measured, with high sensitivity, A-to-I editing that can be attributed to overexpression of ABEmax, the most efficient ABE variant reported to date (6). We used both targeted deep sequencing of individual abundant mRNA transcripts, as well as transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), to find that ABEmax can induce low levels of widespread A-to-I editing across the transcriptome. Comparison of RNA editing rates between ABEmax mutants with catalytically disabled deaminase domains revealed that both the wild-type TadA monomer and the evolved TadA* monomer contribute to RNA editing. Guided by an analysis of the TadA structure and the evolved TadA* mutations, we designed a series of ABEmax mutants to minimize RNA editing activity. We found ABEmax variants with mutations in both TadA domains that greatly reduce RNA editing while maintaining efficient target DNA editing, improving DNA specificity, and reducing indel by-product formation. These new ABEmax variants may be especially useful for applications that demand minimal RNA editing and high DNA specificity."

                "We began by transfecting HEK293T cells with a plasmid expressing ABEmax and isolating genomic DNA and RNA after 48 hours. After complementary DNA (cDNA) generation from polyadenylated cellular mRNA, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on 220- to 250-nt (nucleotide) regions of three mRNA amplicons: beta catenin-1 (CTNNB1), calnexin (IP90), and ribosomal L1 domain containing 1 (RSL1D1). We chose CTNNB1 and IP90 as two examples of abundant mRNAs in HEK293T cells, and we studied RSL1D1 because it contains a region highly homologous to the 20-nt region of E. coli tRNAArg2 that is the native substrate of TadA (24). The TadA minimal substrate sequence is GCUCGGCUACGAACCGAG, while the homologous region of RSL1D1 mRNA is agUCGGCUACGGAAuuuAG, where uppercase letters indicate sequence identity. In all three transcripts, ABEmax generated low but detectable levels of RNA editing above the endogenous level of A-to-I editing from cellular deaminases (25, 27), which we measured using a Cas9(D10A)-only control. ABEmax expression increased both the extent of A-to-I conversions throughout the transcript (Fig. 1C), measured by the number of sequenced adenosines with an A-to-I conversion frequency of >0.10%, and the magnitude of A-to-I editing (Fig. 1D), measured by the average percentage of A-to-I conversion at every sequenced adenosine. For example, ABEmax generated an average of 1.3 \u00b1 0.41% A-to-I conversion among all sequenced adenosines in RSL1D1 mRNA, a 22-fold increase relative to the Cas9(D10A) nickase\u2013only control that averaged 0.060 \u00b1 0.010% A-to-I conversion in the same transcript. Likewise, ABEmax resulted in detectable deamination of 27 \u00b1 2 of 46 adenosines sequenced in RSL1D1 mRNA, while the Cas9(D10A) nickase\u2013only control resulted in detectable deamination of 7 \u00b1 1 (3.9-fold fewer) of these 46 adenosines (Fig. 1, C and D). To test whether RNA editing activity requires fusion with the Cas9 component of the base editor, we overexpressed the TadA-TadA* monomer in trans with Cas9(D10A) nickase or dead Cas9 and observed substantial RNA editing under these conditions at all three tested transcripts (Fig. 1, C and D). This outcome confirmed that RNA editing activity arises from the unassisted binding of TadA domains to cellular RNA and focused our efforts to improve the DNA:RNA specificity of ABE on engineering these deaminases. Together, these results establish that the TadA-TadA* deaminase component of ABEmax mediates low levels of cellular RNA editing.",
                "Glu70 is a critical catalytic residue in E. coli TadA, and the TadA E70A mutant either alone (24) or in ABE (1) has no deaminase activity. In the soluble, N-terminally truncated version of TadA (24) used in ABE (1), Glu70 corresponds to Glu59 and will be referred to as Glu59 hereafter. To identify which TadA monomers mediate RNA editing in ABEmax, we introduced inactivating E59A mutations into either the TadA or TadA* monomer of ABEmax and measured RNA (Fig. 1, C and D) and DNA (Fig. 1E) editing activity of the resulting variants. Installing the E59A mutation in the wild-type TadA monomer to generate ABEmax(TadA E59A) modestly reduced the average number of edited adenosines in all three tested transcripts relative to ABEmax (Fig. 1C). Despite the modest reduction in RNA editing activity associated with ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmax(TadA E59A) maintains high DNA base editing activity similar to that of ABEmax. ABEmax averaged 46.6 \u00b1 3.9% DNA editing across the seven endogenous genomic sites tested, chosen because they result in a wide range of ABEmax editing efficiencies (from 85 \u00b1 6.6% to 4.5 \u00b1 0.70%), while ABEmax(TadA E59A) averaged 41.5 \u00b1 5.4% DNA editing at the same sites (Fig. 1E). ABEmax(TadA E59A) also displayed reduced indel formation at these seven genomic sites compared to ABEmax (fig. S1), from a mean of 2.3 \u00b1 0.39% with ABEmax to 1.1 \u00b1 0.24% with ABEmax(TadA E59A). These data suggest that inactivation of the catalytic domain in the wild-type TadA monomer can reduce off-target RNA editing and indel formation without substantially sacrificing on-target DNA editing efficiency.",
                "By contrast, neither ABEmax(TadA* E59A) nor ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A) edit RNA (Fig. 1, C and D) or DNA (Fig. 1E), with one notable exception: ABEmax(TadA* E59A), which contains a wild-type TadA monomer but an inactivated evolved TadA* monomer, edits RSL1D1 mRNA at position 152, the adenosine that is highly homologous to that of TadA\u2019s native tRNAArg substrate (Fig. 1F). Together, these data indicate that both wild-type TadA and TadA* in ABEmax can deaminate RNA in a Cas9-independent manner. This off-target RNA editing activity can be reduced by inactivating the wild-type TadA monomer, but residual RNA editing activity remains from TadA*, which cannot be inactivated without abolishing DNA editing activity (Fig. 1D).",
                "To test whether these findings apply to many different cellular transcripts, we performed transcriptome-wide analysis of HEK293T cells treated with ABEmax, ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmax(TadA* E59A), and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A). We transfected cells with plasmids expressing the base editor and a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)\u2013targeting sgRNA. Targeting the base editors to an expressed gene mimics their typical use (3) and enables detection of the on-target U-to-C edit in the corresponding LDLR mRNA transcript during transcriptome-wide RNA-seq as an internal positive control (Fig. 1G). Since A-to-I editing in cellular mRNA from endogenous deaminases is a common source of natural RNA editing in metazoans (25, 27), we used cells treated with Cas9(D10A) nickase only as a control to identify A-to-I RNA editing levels from endogenous cellular deaminases.",
                "Transcriptome-wide RNA-seq data revealed that, on average, ABEmax overexpression induced 14,959 additional high-confidence A-to-I edits compared to the Cas9 nickase\u2013only control (Fig. 1H). Although ABEmax overexpression adds only 28% more detected A-to-I edits than the 53,334 endogenous cellular A-to-I edits observed in the Cas9 nickase\u2013only control, these additional ABEmax-induced RNA edits were widespread throughout the transcriptome, including 10,335 transcripts not edited in the Cas9 nickase\u2013only control samples. These data confirm that low-level RNA editing is widespread throughout the transcriptome among cells overexpressing ABEmax.",
                "RNA editing across the transcriptome was reduced by inactivating either TadA or TadA* monomers. Catalytically inactivated ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* E59A) resulted in 53,917 A-to-I edits, similar to the 53,334 A-to-I edits detected in the Cas9 nickase\u2013only control. ABEmax(TadA E59A) resulted in 12,142 more A-to-I edits than the Cas9 nickase\u2013only control, 19% fewer additional A-to-I edits than the 14,959 mediated by ABEmax (Fig. 1H). The average A-to-I RNA editing frequency across all transcripts was 0.22% for ABEmax, 0.19% for ABEmax(TadA E59A), and 0.13% for Cas9(D10A) nickase only (Fig. 1I). Together, these findings indicate that transcriptome-wide RNA editing is modestly reduced by inactivating the wild-type TadA monomer in ABEmax.",
                "Given the lack of an elucidated structure of ABE or of the E. coli TadA homodimer bound to RNA, we used the crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus TadA, which has high sequence homology to E. coli TadA (23), to guide the design of ABE mutants that further reduce RNA editing. Starting with ABEmax(TadA E59A), the construct with the inactivated wild-type TadA domain that shows reduced RNA editing but maintains strong DNA base editing (Fig. 1, C and H), we installed mutations into the evolved TadA* monomer.",
                "We identified three TadA* residues predicted to interact with the RNA substrate as targets for substitutions that might impair TadA*-mediated RNA deamination. We hypothesized that impeding the ability of TadA* to accommodate 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups that are present in RNA, but absent in DNA, by replacing these three amino acids with larger or more hydrophobic residues (Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met) could further improve the DNA versus RNA editing specificity of ABEmax(TadA E59A). Arg47 is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the substrate adenosine (Fig. 2A). We replaced Arg47 in TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met in an effort to abrogate this interaction. We also generated a series of ABEmax mutants with TadA* substitutions at either Asn108 (Fig. 2B) or Val106 (Fig. 2C), two residues that are located close to the catalytic site of TadA and that mutated from Asp108 and Ala106 during the evolution of TadA* (1). Asp108 is predicted to directly hydrogen-bond with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the uridine immediately 5\u2032 of the substrate adenosine (Fig. 2B), and replacement of Ala106 might fill some of the space that accommodates this uridine, including its 2\u2032-hydroxyl group, with larger and more hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 2C). We replaced Asn108 in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, Lys, or Met, and Val106 in ABEmax TadA* with Gln, Phe, Trp, or Met, in an effort to disrupt the ability of TadA* to accommodate ribonucleotides by eliminating the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds with 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups in RNA or by steric occlusion. We also tested an additional Asn108 Lys mutation to provide a polar side chain that is incapable of serving as a hydrogen bond acceptor, assuming protonation at physiological pH.",
                "We transfected HEK293T cells with each of these 13 ABEmax(TadA E59A) mutants and measured the resulting on-target DNA A\u2022T-to-G\u2022C base editing at the seven genomic loci tested (Fig. 2D). We used HTS of regions of IP90, RSL1D1, and CTNNB1 cDNAs to rapidly assess the RNA editing activities of these 13 mutants in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, E and F) before transcriptome-wide RNA-seq analyses.",
                "Replacing TadA* Arg47 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) with Gln, Met, Phe, or Trp maintained relatively high DNA base editing efficiency, particularly at sites where the target A is at protospacer position 5 [counting the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) as positions 21 to 23]. Average editing efficiencies were reduced from a mean of 47 \u00b1 3.9% for ABEmax(TadA E59A) to a range of 31 to 41% for the four TadA* Arg47 variants. Among the four Arg47 mutants tested, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47M) and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47Q), the most efficient variants for DNA base editing, showed little or no reduction in RNA editing activity compared to ABEmax(TadA E59A) (Fig. 2, E and F). The two variants in which Arg47 was replaced with larger and more rigid hydrophobic residues, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47F) and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* R47W), resulted in up to a twofold reduction in the number of edited adenosines in the interrogated transcripts (Fig. 2E). Unfortunately, this reduction in RNA editing was accompanied by a similar reduction in DNA editing at sgRNAs in which the target A was located at positions other than position 5 in the protospacer (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that replacing Arg47 with Phe or Trp impairs both RNA and DNA editing, and replacing this residue with Met or Gln impairs neither DNA nor RNA editing.",
                "Mutation of TadA* Asn108 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) generally preserved DNA base editing at sites in which the target A was at protospacer position 5 but greatly reduced DNA editing at other target sites. The most active Asn108 mutant, ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108K), mediated an average of 25 \u00b1 0.2% on-target DNA editing (Fig. 2D), a 1.9-fold reduction compared to ABEmax, but also exhibited the highest levels of RNA editing among the Asn108 mutants assayed (Fig. 2, E and F). Mutation of TadA* Asn108 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) to Phe, Trp, Gln, or Met greatly reduced RNA editing compared to ABEmax in the three transcripts sequenced at depth to levels statistically indistinguishable from background RNA editing observed in the Cas9(D10A)-only controls (Student\u2019s two-tailed t test, P > 0.05 for comparisons between number of edited adenosines in each transcript; Fig. 2E). Together, these data indicate that Asn108 in TadA* is important for efficient DNA base editing at protospacer positions beyond the most preferred one (position 5) and is also essential for RNA editing. The ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108Q) or ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108W) variants may be useful when the target A is at protospacer position 5 and minimizing RNA editing is critical.",
                "Substitution of TadA* Val106 in ABEmax(TadA E59A) resulted in variants that exhibited much lower RNA editing while maintaining DNA editing levels similar to those of ABEmax(TadA E59A) and ABEmax. All four Val106 mutants mediated effective DNA base editing across the seven genomic loci tested; the most efficient DNA base editor among these mutants was ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* V106W), hereafter referred to as ABEmaxAW, which yielded an average of 36 \u00b1 1.4% A\u2022T-to-G\u2022C DNA editing [compared to 41 \u00b1 5.4% for ABEmax(TadA E59A) and 47 \u00b1 3.9% for ABEmax]. ABEmaxAW exhibited both the highest level of DNA base editing and the lowest level of RNA off-target editing among the Val106 mutants tested (Fig. 2, E and F). Analysis of the RNA isolated from cells transfected with ABEmaxAW indicated that the number of detectable A-to-I edits among the regions of the three transcripts analyzed was reduced from an average of 94 \u00b1 8 (of 182 total adenosines) for ABEmax to 26 \u00b1 10 for ABEmaxAW, similar to the background of 12 \u00b1 6 for Cas9 nickase alone (Fig. 2E). The average magnitude of A-to-I edits was also greatly reduced in cells treated with ABEmaxAW (an average frequency of 0.068% A-to-I editing among 182 total adenosines) to levels approaching those observed from Cas9 nickase alone (0.041% average), a 7.2-fold reduction compared with the average of 0.49% A-to-I editing of ABEmax (Fig. 2F). These findings establish that ABEmaxAW greatly reduces off-target RNA editing while preserving most of the on-target DNA editing activity of ABEmax.",
                "We tested the applicability of our findings to other mammalian cell types. First, we compared the DNA base editing activities of ABEmax, ABEmax(TadA E59A), ABEmaxAW, and ABEmax(TadA E59A, TadA* N108W) in HeLa cells (fig. S2) and ABEmax and ABEmaxAW in U2OS and K562 cells (fig. S3). DNA base editing efficiencies among unsorted HeLa and U2OS cells were uniformly lower than in HEK293T cells (fig. S2A), possibly due to poorer transfection or nucleofection efficiencies (6). The DNA base editing activity of ABEmaxAW relative to ABEmax and ABEmax(TadA E59A), however, generally remained similar in all three cell types (figs. S2A and S3A). Next, we investigated RNA editing frequencies and magnitudes in U2OS and K562 cells, finding once again that, compared to ABEmax, the use of ABEmaxAW greatly reduced RNA editing to levels indistinguishable from those of the Cas9(D10A) control (fig. S3, C and D). Together, these data indicate that ABEmaxAW can mitigate RNA editing in multiple mammalian cell types.",
                "We assessed the effect of longer exposure time to ABEmax or ABEmaxAW in HEK293T cells by harvesting cells 5 days after transfection, instead of 48 hours. This change increased the average DNA base editing associated with both ABEmax and ABEmaxAW by 1.1-fold, to 52 \u00b1 2.7% for ABEmax and 39 \u00b1 1.7% for ABEmaxAW (fig. S4, A and B). Unexpectedly, average RNA editing was reduced compared to the 48-hour treatment; ABEmax yielded an average frequency of 0.29 \u00b1 0.063% A-to-I editing across the 182 adenosines sequenced (compared with 0.49 \u00b1 0.13% at 48 hours). The average frequency of A-to-I mutation with ABEmaxAW after 5 days (0.074 \u00b1 0.014%, 3.9-fold lower than that of ABEmax) remained close to the background frequency associated with Cas9(D10A) nickase alone of 0.051 \u00b1 0.010% (fig. S4, C and D). We speculate that the steady loss (or silencing) of transfected plasmids expressing base editors, coupled with the constant degradation and replenishment of the transcriptome, may result in lower RNA editing rates at longer time points.",
                "These TadA* mutations might further weaken the ability of ABEmax variants to bind off-target DNA sequences that are already more weakly bound by Cas9. To test this possibility, we measured the levels of off-target DNA editing by ABEmax and a subset of the ABEmax variants described above. We used HTS to assess the frequencies of off-target A\u00b7T-to-G\u00b7C base editing and indel formation at 12 known off-target sites associated with HEK site 2, HEK site 3, and HEK site 4 (figs. S5 to S7) (28). Among these 12 off-target sites, 10 had at least one adenosine within the canonical ABE editing window (from protospacer positions 4 to 8) (1, 3). The mean A\u00b7T-to-G\u00b7C editing efficiency at these 10 candidate off-target loci from ABEmax was 2.1 \u00b1 0.22%, similar to that of ABEmax(TadA E59A) (2.0 \u00b1 0.28%; figs. S5 to S7). Notably, ABEmaxAW generated an average off-target editing frequency of 0.79 \u00b1 0.18%, a 2.5-fold improvement compared to ABEmax(TadA E59A) and a 2.7-fold improvement relative to ABEmax. Collectively, these results indicate that mutations that reduce the tolerance of ABEmax for RNA editing also increase the DNA specificity of base editing, likely by reducing DNA binding interactions that support productive editing of off-target loci.",
                "Notably, ABEmaxAW also generated 3.7-fold fewer indels than ABEmax at the seven on-target DNA loci tested (from an average of 2.3 \u00b1 0.39% for ABEmax to 0.62 \u00b1 0.0069% for ABEmaxAW; fig. S1). The reason for this reduced indel frequency is unclear, but we hypothesize that indel formation may be dependent on the structure or activity of the wild-type TadA monomer. Consistent with this hypothesis, ABEmax(TadA E59A) also shows reduced average indel formation (1.1 \u00b1 0.24%), and ABEmax(TadA* E59A), which cannot perform DNA base editing, induces indels at an elevated frequency of 4.3 \u00b1 0.45% (fig. S1).",
                "To further illuminate the impact of V106W in TadA* on the DNA and RNA editing activities of ABE, we generated and tested two additional ABEmax mutants: ABEmax(TadA E59, TadA* V106W) (ABEmaxEW) and ABEmax(TadA E59Q, TadA* V106W) (ABEmaxQW) (fig. S8). ABEmaxEW displayed slightly higher DNA on-target editing frequencies than ABEmaxAW (fig. S8A) but also greater indel (fig. S8B) and RNA editing frequencies (fig. S8, C and D), confirming that mutation of both the wild-type and the evolved TadA monomers is required for the most effective reduction in RNA editing and indel frequencies. ABEmaxQW performed as well as or slightly better than ABEmaxAW at on-target DNA base editing (fig. S8A) and displayed similarly low levels of off-target RNA editing (fig. S8, C and D). Consistent with our observations that the wild-type TadA monomer plays a role in indel formation (fig. S1), both ABEmaxEW and ABEmaxQW displayed substantially higher indel frequencies than ABEmaxAW (fig. S8B). These comparisons together indicate that both inactivation of the wild-type TadA and mutation of the evolved monomer with V106W are required to minimize off-target RNA editing, and ABEmaxQW may display higher on-target base editing efficiency at some sites than ABEmaxAW but without the consistently lower indel frequencies of ABEmaxAW.",
                "Last, we performed RNA-seq to identify transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing frequencies associated with ABEmaxAW. We confirmed robust on-target DNA editing activity in the RNA-seq samples treated with ABEmax, ABEmax(E59A), and ABEmaxAW by observing substantial U-to-C mutation in the LDLR mRNA, which resulted from base editing the corresponding genomic DNA site directed by the LDLR-targeting sgRNA (Fig. 2G). While the proportion of edited LDLR mRNA reads is reduced in the ABEmaxAW sample (24 of 90, 27%) compared to the ABEmax (37 of 98, 38%) and ABEmax(TadA E59A) (18 of 66, 27%), the numbers of LDLR mRNA transcripts aligned to the reference sequence are low, making precise quantitation challenging. Consistent with the above results analyzing the three test transcripts in depth, ABEmaxAW only slightly elevated the number of A-to-I edits (57,685) beyond those observed in the Cas9(D10A) nickase\u2013only control (53,334). ABEmaxAW thus resulted in substantially fewer transcriptome edits compared to ABEmax or ABEmax(E59A) [10,608 fewer A-to-I edits than ABEmax and 7791 fewer than ABEmax(E59A); Fig. 2, G and H]. We also compared the average A-to-I RNA editing frequency across all transcripts and found that the average of 0.22% A-to-I RNA editing for ABEmax was reduced to 0.14% for ABEmaxAW and to 0.13% for the Cas9(D10A) nickase\u2013only control (Fig. 2I). These findings confirm that ABEmaxAW maintains strong DNA base editing activity while exhibiting much lower transcriptome-wide RNA editing compared to ABEmax.",
                "To determine the potential biological significance of the A-to-I edits observed with ABEmax and ABEmaxAW, we used the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor to determine where the edits were located within mRNA transcripts in our transcriptome-wide sequencing data (Fig. 3A). The RNA editing associated with ABEmax was spread across the transcriptome and not localized to particular regions (fig. S9). Only 4.2% of the A-to-I edits was in a protein-coding region; of these, 69% leads to coding changes (Fig. 3B). Next, we used Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) to predict the impact of these coding changes on protein function, revealing that 58% of the coding A-to-I mutations are predicted to have a deleterious impact on protein function (Fig. 3C). In total, ABEmax induced 1138 A-to-I mutations predicted to be deleterious to protein function, compared to 535 for Cas9(D10A) alone. This was reduced to 727 for ABEmaxAW (Fig. 3C). Mutations in the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 untranslated region can also be deleterious to protein function, but the effects of these mutations are not readily predictable (29). Last, we note that the biological consequence even of mutations that genuinely impair protein function are likely to be minimized by the very low average A-to-I RNA editing frequency of 0.21% for ABEmax, and 0.14% for ABEmaxAW, compared to 0.13% for the Cas9(D10A) nickase\u2013only control."

                "In this study, we identified widespread, low-level cellular RNA editing from ABEs that was greatly reduced, without substantially sacrificing on-target DNA editing, by introducing the E59A or E59Q mutation into TadA and the V106W mutation in TadA*. In addition to decoupling DNA and RNA editing activities, the ABEmaxAW variant substantially reduced off-target DNA editing activity and the formation of indel by-products. Although we note that even ABEmax-mediated RNA editing is both low level (averaging 0.21% across all transcripts) and transient given the short half-life of most cellular RNAs (25, 27), the extent to which low-level RNA editing may interfere with base editing biological studies or therapeutics development efforts will depend strongly on features of the specific applications, including the duration of exposure to the base editor. We recommend that researchers use ABEmaxAW or ABEmaxQW for adenine base editing applications that require minimizing RNA editing, off-target DNA editing, and/or indel formation."
