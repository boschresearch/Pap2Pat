    "abstract": "The present invention is a method for determining the identity of the epitopes recognized by T-cells. The method consists of expressing an encoded library of candidate epitope sequences in a recipient reporter cell capable of providing a detectable signal upon cytotoxic attack from a single cognate T-cell followed by contacting the reporter cells with T-cells of interest. The reporter cells with a signal indicating cytotoxic attack from a T-cell are isolated and then analyzed by next-generation sequencing in order to identify the epitope sequences.",

                        "The elucidation of CTL epitopes is crucial to the understanding of the molecular etiology of immune related disorders and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Reliable identification of T-cell epitopes would, in particular, address an unmet need in the fields of cancer immunology, infectious disease, autoimmunity, and transplantation medicine. T-cell epitopes are short peptides displayed at the surface of antigen-presenting cells by the membrane-bound major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, which are categorized as either class I or II. Class I molecules are expressed on the surface of nearly every cell of the body and present a sampling of short (8-14 residue) peptides derived from proteolytic turnover of proteins of both endogenous and exogenous origin. MHC class I found to be presenting epitopes recognized as \u2018non-self\u2019 are targets of direct attack from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).",
                        "The discovery of T-cell epitopes has proven to be a difficult endeavor given numerous characteristics of CTL antigen recognition including (a) extreme diversity of the T-cell repertoire generally ensures that clonotypes of interest are present in very low numbers, (b) T-cell epitope recognition is a low affinity interaction that must occur in the context of polygenic and highly polyallelic MHC molecules, (c) processing and presentation of both exogenous and endogenous peptides on MHC molecules makes for an enormous T-cell epitope space to be screened, and (d) substantial level of cross-reactivity is present in the T-cell repertoire, for example, it has been found that a single CTL is capable of recognizing on the order of 106 different peptide-MHC (pMHC) antigens. Extensive research and development efforts in the field of T-cell epitope discovery have been ongoing over the previous three decades but to date no practical high throughput method is available to routinely identify T-cell epitopes, Sharma and Holt, Human Immunology, 75: 514-519 (2014).",
                        "In view of the above, the availability of a high throughput and convenient method to routinely identify epitopes of selected T cells would be highly advantageous to many fields in medicine and biology, including cancer immunotherapy, vaccine development, organ transplantation, autoimmune disease diagnosis and therapy, and the like."

Such conventional techniques include, but are not limited to, preparation and use of synthetic peptides, synthetic polynucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, nucleic acid cloning, amplifying, sequencing and analysis, and related techniques. Specific illustrations of suitable techniques can be had by reference to the example herein below. However, other equivalent conventional procedures can, of course, also be used. Such conventional techniques and descriptions can be found in standard laboratory manuals such as Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual Series (Vols. 1-IV); PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual; and Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (all from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press); Lutz and Bornscheuer, Editors, Protein Engineering Handbook (Wiley-VCH, 2009); Hermanson.

                        "The invention is directed to methods, compositions of matter and kits directed to the identification and/or isolation of T-cell epitopes of an individual. In one aspect, the invention provides reporter cells that are species and HLA matched to an individual (i.e. MHC matched), wherein such reporter cells express a library of epitopes for MHC-restricted presentation and wherein such reporter cells provide a detectable signal whenever a cytotoxic lymphocyte of the individual recognizes an MHC-epitope complex presented by such cells and is activated to produce an effector response or function. In some embodiments, a detectable signal permits reporter cells to be isolated and the nucleic acids encoding their epitopes analyzed for identification. In other embodiments, reporter cells that are recognized by an individual's cytotoxic lymphocytes are ruptured by apoptotic processes and release nucleic acids into a reaction mixture from which such cell-free epitope-encoding nucleic acids may be detected directly, for example, by amplification or by amplification and sequencing. In alternatives of the latter embodiments, additional steps may include separating the reaction mixture or culture supernatant from intact cells prior to amplification and sequencing. Guidance for isolating, amplifying and sequencing cell-free DNA of this latter embodiment is found in Oliphant et al, U.S. patent publication 2013/0143213, and like references, which are incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "In another aspect, such reporter cells are used in a method for determining epitopes recognized by T cells of an individual comprising the steps of: (a) contacting reporter cells expressing a library of epitopes with a sample of cytotoxic lymphocytes from the individual under conditions that permit the cytotoxic lymphocytes to have an effector response whenever their T cell receptors recognize a cognate epitope-MHC complex; (b) isolating reporter cells that have been recognized by cytotoxic lymphocytes and induced to generate a detectable signal; (c) analyzing the epitope-encoding nucleic acids of the isolated reporter cells to determine the identity of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic lymphocytes of the individual. The foregoing step of analyzing may be carried out by a variety of techniques, such as, hybridization to microarrays, DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), or like techniques. In some embodiments, the step of analyzing is carried out by sequencing the epitope-encoding nucleic acids. In other embodiments, the step of analyzing is carried out by amplifying the epitope-encoding nucleic acids from the isolated reporter cells, or a sample thereof, to form an amplicon, followed by DNA sequencing of member polynucleotides of the amplicon.",
                        "Features of the foregoing method are illustrated diagrammatically in FIGS. 1A and 1B. Reporter cells (102) are combined with cytotoxic lymphocytes (100), either individually using single cell techniques or in bulk by combining populations of each, under conditions that permit specific binding and recognition of an MHC-epitope complex by T cell receptors of the cytotoxic lymphocytes. In some embodiments, reporter cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes are combined in a reaction mixture under conventional tissue culture conditions for mammalian cell culture. Such reaction mixtures may include conventional mammalian cell culture media, such as DMEM, RPMI, or like commercially available compositions, with or without additional components such as indicators and buffering agents to control pH and ionic concentrations, physiological salts, growth factors, antibiotics, and like compounds. Reporter cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes may be incubated for a period of time, e.g. 30 min to 24 hours, or in other embodiments, 30 min to 6 hours, under such conditions to permit cell-cell contact and receptor recognition; that is, where T cell receptors of cytotoxic lymphocytes specifically recognize MHC-epitope complexes and generate an effector response that leads to the generation of a detectable signal in reporter cells. Returning to FIG. 1A, upon contact and specific recognition (104) of T cell receptor (106) and MHC-epitope complex (108 and 110), epitope-specific lymphocyte (100) is activated (111) to produce granules (114) that contain a variety of effector agents, including granzyme proteases (120) and perforins (118). As part of an effector response, granules of the activated epitope-specific lymphocyte (100) are transported to the cell surface and released (116) into the intercellular environment adjacent to reporter cell (102) by exocytosis. Perforins (118) assemble and form pores (122) through the cell membrane of reporter cell (102), after which granzymes and other effector agents enter (124) the cytosol of reporter cell (102). In some embodiments, a signal-generating structure (125) may comprise a quenched fluorescent protein that may be unquenched by granzyme cleavage (126) of a peptide link that releases a fluorescent moiety to generate signal (130).",
                        "In contrast, as illustrated in FIG. 1B, if no recognition and specific binding (105) occur between T cell receptors of epitope-specific lymphocyte (100) and MHC-epitope complex (110 and 109), for example, because epitope (109) is not recognized by the receptor, then no activation takes place, no effector agents get delivered to the cytosol of reporter cell (102), and no signal is generated (132). Thus, only reporter cells whose epitopes are recognized generate signals. Reporter cells may be isolated based on such signals and the nucleic acids encoding their epitope are determined. In some embodiments, recognized reporter cells generate optical signals and are isolated based on the presence, absence and/or level of such optical signal, e.g. by FACS. In some embodiments, recognized reporter cells generate a cell surface affinity molecule, e.g. as described by Pacini et al, Anal. Biochem., 331(1): 46-59 (2004), and like references, and may be isolated by affinity purification, panning, bead capture, or the like, using a complementary binding compound.",
                        "In one embodiment, high-throughput epitope screening involves the use of a reporter cell line genetically modified with an encoded library of candidate epitope-encoding nucleic acids that express products capable of fluorescing upon cytotoxic attack from a cytotoxic T-cell. Such genetic modification may be carried out by transient or stable transfection, transduction by conventional vectors, such as, retroviruses lentiviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and the like, as well as by genetic engineering tools, such as, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the like. Fluorescent cells can then be separated from the population at-large by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Schemes illustrating two implementations of this embodiment are shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. Exemplary vectors for transfecting the reporter cells lines are illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B.",
                        "In accordance with the invention, identification of nucleic acids encoding reactive epitopes from sequence data may require application of well-known bioinformatics methods (e.g., Kent, Genome Res. 12 (4): 656-664 (2002)) for comparing sequence read data with database sequences of an individual's genome sequence or with other available databases of genomic sequences, transcriptome sequences, cancer genome sequences, or the like."

                                "In some embodiments, reporter cells may be a primary or immortalized antigen presenting cell (APC) line that is MHC class I positive, and preferably, species matched and MHC matched with the individual whose T cell epitopes are being identified. Thus, in some embodiments, reporter cells may be derived from any autologous MHC class I positive cells of an individual. Such cells may be immortalized by conventional techniques, e.g. by viral transformation. In one embodiment, reporter cells may be autologous B cells, e.g. from the peripheral blood of the individual whose T cell epitopes are being identified, that have been transformed into B cell lymphoblastoid cells by viral transformation, for example, by EBV.",
                                "Alternatively, in some embodiments, if the sequence of the class I MHC molecule is known for an individual whose T cell epitopes are to be identified, then a reporter cell may be a non-autologous cell or cell line and may be transfected or transduced with a transgene encoding the individual's MHC class 1 molecule for expression on its surface, for example, as taught by Dommair et al, U.S. patent publication 2013/0195900, which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, non-autologous cells or cells of a cell line may be transfected or transduced with a library comprising vectors that are all capable of expression the same patient-matched MHC class I molecule but different epitopes.",

In some embodiments, reporter cells are transduced using a viral vector, such as a lentivirus, which results in a stable viral integration into the reporter cell genome. Transduction is carried out under conditions that result in on average no more than one viral integration event per target reporter cell. Transduction techniques include, but are not limited to, lipofection, electroporation, and the like.",
                                "As noted above, one function of a reporter cell is to generate a detectable signal whenever its displayed epitope is recognized by a T cell and the T cell generates an effector response. In some embodiments, a detectable signal is generated by a signal generating product expressed by one or more transgenes in the reporter cell. Such transgene may be inserted into the reporter cell by conventional transfection or transformation techniques. In some embodiments, the activity of protease effector agents, such as granzyme B, is employed directly or indirectly (e.g. via activation of a caspase protease) to activate signaling agents. In some embodiments, optical signals are generated by a FRET-based signaling system or a leuco-dye-based system wherein a cleavage event or other chemical modification converts a non-signaling reporter to one that generated an optical signal, e.g., Muthyala, Editor, \u201cChemistry and Applications of Leuco Dyes,\u201d (Plenum Press, New York, 1997). A wide variety of FRET-based and protein and organic leuco-dye signaling systems are available for use in the invention, including such systems that are genetically encoded, for example, fluorescent proteins, and that are delivered to reporter cells as membrane permeable reagents, for example, the CellEvent\u00ae reagent available from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.), the GranToxiLux\u00ae reagent available from OncoImmunin, Inc. (Gaithersburg, Md.), and the like. FRET-based fluorescent protein signaling systems are commercially available and well-known in the art. Guidance for their application is described in the following exemplary references, which are incorporated by reference: Shimozono et al, Methods Cell Biol., 85: 381-393 (2008)(describing FRET-based signaling systems comprising cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)); Xu et al, Nucleic Acids Research, 26(8): 2034-2035 (1998)(describing FRET-based signaling systems comprising green fluorescent protein (GFP) and blue fluorescent protein (BFP)); Felber et al. Biotechniques, 36(5): 878-885 (2004); and the like. In some embodiments, a genetic construct (which may be part of a vector encoding epitopes) expresses a fusion protein which is a FRET-based signaling system having the form: FP1-p-FP2, where FP1 is an acceptor moiety, FP2 is a donor moiety, and p is a peptide linkage that contains a recognitions site for a protease. FP1 and FP2 are selected so that when held in proximity to one another by p, FP1 quenches fluorescent emissions by FP2, and whenever peptide linkage, p, is cleaved, FP1 and FP2 are release from one another so that FP2 emits a fluorescent signal freely. Vectors expressing such FRET-based signaling systems (or agents) may be constructed using conventional molecular biology techniques, as exemplified in the above-cited references and the examples below. Conventional techniques for protein expression in mammalian cells may be used in implementing variations of the invention, e.g. as disclosed by Hartley (Editor), \u201cProtein expression in mammalian cells,\u201d Methods in Molecular Biology, vol. 801 (Humana Press, 2012).",

FIG. 2A shows vector pCAG-CY which may be used for validation of encodable signaling agents, in the case illustrated, a granzyme B-activatable FRET gene, and for stable reporter cell line development. FIG. 2B shows a plasmid containing a bicistronic antigen-reporter gene separated by a P2A self-cleaving sequence. This construct may be used for transient co-transfection of a control or test antigen or antigen libraries and a FRET reporter gene.",

Briefly, downstream of MND promoter (250) is inserted minigene (252) containing epitope-encoding nucleic acid (254) and flanking nucleic acids that may include primer binding sequences to facilitate identification after isolation, a P2A self-cleaving site (256) that permits discrete translation of epitope peptides and signaling proteins, gene (258) encoding a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), nucleic acid (260) encoding a peptide linker cleavable by granzyme B, gene (262) encoding yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), as well as other lentivirus elements.",

In some embodiments, such reporter cells are first isolated then, in turn, the epitope-encoding nucleic acids are isolated from such cells. For example, in some embodiments epitopes are expressed from plasmids so that the encoding nucleic acids may be isolated using conventional miniprep techniques, for example, using commercially available kits, e.g. Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.), after which encoding sequences may be identified by such steps as PCR amplification, DNA sequencing or hybridization to complementary sequences. In other embodiments, where epitopes are expressed from integrated vectors, epitope-encoding nucleic acids from isolated reporter cells may be amplified from the reporter cell genome by PCR, followed by isolation and analysis of the resulting amplicon, for example, by DNA sequencing. In the latter embodiments, epitope-encoding nucleic acids may be flanked by primer binding sites to facilitate such analysis.",

CM consisted of RPMI 1640, 25 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.2, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L-glutamine, and 5.5\u00d710\u22125 mol/L \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, supplemented with 10% human serum. The plates are placed in a humidified 37\u00b0 C. incubator with 5% CO2 and cultured until lymphocyte growth is evident. Each fragment is inspected about every other day using a low-power inverted microscope to monitor the extrusion and proliferation of lymphocytes. Whether or not lymphocyte growth is visible, half of the medium is replaced in all wells no later than 1 week after culture initiation. Typically, about 1 to 2 weeks after culture initiation, a dense lymphocytic carpet covers a portion of the plate surrounding each fragment. When any well becomes almost confluent, the contents are mixed vigorously, split into two daughter wells and filled to 2 mL per well with CM plus 6000 IU/mL IL-2. Subsequently, the cultures are split to maintain a cell density of 0.8-1.6\u00d7106 cells/mL, or half of the media was replaced at least twice weekly.",
                                "TIL cultures from single cell digests. Briefly, each solid tumor specimen is carefully dissected free of surrounding normal tissue and necrotic areas. The tumor is sliced with a sharp scalpel into small pieces (approximately 2 mm on each side). The tumor fragments are immersed in a mixture of collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNAse in serum-free RPMI 1640, and incubated overnight with gentle agitation. The single-cell slurry is passed through sterile wire mesh to remove undigested tissue chunks. The digested single-cell suspensions are washed twice in HBSS, viable cells are purified on a single step Ficoll gradient, and cells are resuspended for plating. Multiple wells of a 24-well plate are seeded with 1\u00d7106 viable cells in 2 mL CM with 6000 IU/mL IL-2. The plates are placed in a humidified 37\u00b0 C. incubator with 5% CO2. Whether or not lymphocyte growth is visible, half of the medium was replaced in all wells no later than 1 week after culture initiation. When any well became nearly confluent, the contents are mixed vigorously, split into two daughter wells, and filled to 2 mL, per well with CM plus 6000 IU/mL IL-2. Subsequently, half the media is replaced at least twice weekly, or the cultures are split to maintain a cell density of 0.8 to 1.6\u00d7106 cells/mL. Some of the TIL from digests are derived from multiple original wells that were regularly mixed and eventually pooled for assessment of activity. Other TIL from digests are derived from individual wells of a 24-well plate. For these cultures, all progeny cells from any individual well are treated as an independent TIL culture and are maintained separately from the descendants of any other original well. In this way, multiple cultures may be obtained from the same initial single-cell suspension.",
                                "TIL cultures from disaggregation. In some embodiments, TILs are derived by a method of physical disaggregation of melanoma fragments using a device, such as a Medimachine (Becton Dickenson) with 50 \u03bcm \u201cmedicon\u201d chambers, which are mini sterile and disposable homogenizers. Fragments of tumor about 2 mm per side may be prepared by dissection of biopsy specimens free from normal and necrotic tissue. Several fragments at a time may be physically disaggregated by a 30-second Medimachine treatment, which disaggregated the tumor chunks using mechanical shear provided by a rotating disk that forced the tumor chunks across a small grater inside the medicon. The resulting slurry of single cells and small cell aggregates is washed once, and resuspended in CM. The cell suspension is layered onto a two-step gradient with a lower step of 100% Ficoll, and a middle step of 75% Ficoll and 25% CM. After 20 minutes' centrifugation at 2000 rpm (about 1100 g), the interfaces are collected. The lower interface containing the lymphocyte-enriched fraction is processed separately from the upper interface containing the tumor-enriched cells. Each fraction is washed twice. The lower, TIL-enriched fraction is plated in 24-well plates, and individual TIL cultures are generated exactly as for the single-cell suspensions derived by enzymatic degradation.",
                                "Assaying TIL activity. TIL activity and specificity may be determined by analysis of cytokine secretion. TIL and control T-cell lines are washed twice prior to co-culture assay to remove IL-2. TIL cells (1\u00d7105) are plated per well of a 96-well flat-bottom plate with 1\u00d7105 stimulator cells. TILs are generally stimulated. When available, TILs may be stimulated with an autologous tumor cell line or a thawed aliquot of cryopreserved single-cell tumor digests (\u201cfresh tumor\u201d). For some TILs, the TAP-deficient T2 cell line may be pulsed with tumor antigen peptides (for example, for melanoma: MART-1:27-35 (referred to as MART) or gp100:209-217 (referred to as g209)). After overnight c-culture, supernatants are harvested and IFN-\u03b3 secretion is quantified by ELISA (e.g. Pierce/Endogen, Woburn, Mass.)."

The ease of transfection of HeLa cells and the non-epitope restricted cytotoxicity of NK-92MI provide an excellent platform for the assessment of GzmB-specific reporter systems. The data in FIG. 4 show a decrease of FRET signal and a concomitant increase in CFP signal resulting in a when NK-92MI are cultured with CFP-YFP HeLa transfectants.

Therefore, for initial development, a CTL system comprising replenishable primary CD8+ splenocytes from OT-I transgenic mice was used.

                        "\u201cGranzyme-perforin pathway\u201d means a process for delivering effector agents in lytic granules of a first cell, usually a cytotoxic lymphocyte, to the cytosol of a second cell, i.e. a target cell. Elements of the process include transportation of lytic granules in the cytosol of the first cell to its cell membrane and exocyosis of the lytic granule contents into the intercellular space adjacent to the target cell. Other elements of the process involve the functions of the contents of the lytic granules. In humans there are four granzymes: A, B, K and M, of which granzyme B (GzB) is the best characterized, most abundant (along with granzyme A), and the focus of this proposal. GzB is a serine protease with a classical trypsin-like catalytic triad that initiates apoptosis in targeted cells. Synthesized primarily in cytotoxic lymphocytes as a 247 amino acid precursor protein, GzB is directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by a signal peptide, which is subsequently cleaved, yielding the zymogen form of GzB, which is still inactive due to a N-terminal dipeptide. This proenzyme is sorted through the Golgi network in a pathway that involves the addition of mannose-6-phosphate, as well as the chaperone molecule serglycin, both of which promote localization of GzB to lytic granules (LGs), a type of specialized secretory lysososome. Here the dipeptide is cleaved by cathepsin C, and the active form of GzB is safely sequestered in the acidic LG and stored there awaiting CTL activation. The other major component of this pathway is perforin, a long, thin protein that forms pores in targeted cells, and is stored in LGs along with granzyme-serglycin aggregates. Upon TCR engagement in an activated CTL, a tight enclosed region between the CTL and target cell forms, which is known as the immunological synapse (IS). Perforin and granzyme are exocytosed from the LGs into the IS, and diffuse across to the target cell membrane, into which perforin inserts, and then aggregates to form multimeric, transmembrane pores. Historically it was thought that these perforin pores were directly responsible for target cell death, but it is now believed that physiological concentrations of perforin alone are not cytotoxic. Instead, the pores seem to be only briefly patent before membrane integrity is restored, with their main function being a conduit for passive diffusion of effector agents, such as granzyme B, into the target cell. Once in the cytosol, it is the effector agents, such as, GzB for example that initiates apoptosis by cleavage of BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (BID) and caspases 3, 7 and 8, which in turn activate the mitochondrial and caspase apoptosis pathways respectively.",
                        "\u201cKit\u201d means any delivery system for delivering materials or reagents for carrying out a method of the invention. In the context of reaction assays, such delivery systems include systems that allow for the storage, transport, or delivery of reaction reagents (e.g., probes, enzymes, etc. in the appropriate containers) and/or supporting materials (e.g., buffers, written instructions for performing the assay etc.) from one location to another. For example, kits include one or more enclosures (e.g., boxes) containing the relevant reaction reagents and/or supporting materials. Such contents may be delivered to the intended recipient together or separately. For example, a first container may contain an enzyme for use in an assay, while a second container contains probes.",

In other embodiments, peptides comprise a linear chain of amino acids having a length in the range of from 8 to 14 amino acids.",
                        "\u201cPolymerase chain reaction\u201d or \u201cPCR\u201d means a reaction for the in vitro amplification of specific DNA sequences by the simultaneous primer extension of complementary strands of DNA. In other words, PCR is a reaction for making multiple copies or replicates of a target nucleic acid flanked by primer binding sites, such reaction comprising one or more repetitions of the following steps: (i) denaturing the target nucleic acid, (ii) annealing primers to the primer binding sites, and (iii) extending the primers by a nucleic acid polymerase in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. Usually, the reaction is cycled through different temperatures optimized for each step in a thermal cycler instrument. Particular temperatures, durations at each step, and rates of change between steps depend on many factors well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g. exemplified by the references: McPherson et al, editors, PCR: A Practical Approach and PCR2: A Practical Approach (IRL Press, Oxford, 1991 and 1995, respectively). For example, in a conventional PCR using Taq DNA polymerase, a double stranded target nucleic acid may be denatured at a temperature >90\u00b0 C., primers annealed at a temperature in the range 50-75\u00b0 C., and primers extended at a temperature in the range 72-78\u00b0 C. Reaction volumes typically range from a few hundred nanoliters, e.g. 200 nL, to a few hundred \u03bcL, e.g. 200 \u03bcL. \u201cPrimer\u201d means an oligonucleotide, either natural or synthetic, that is capable, upon forming a duplex with a polynucleotide template, of acting as a point of initiation of nucleic acid synthesis and being extended from its 3\u2032 end along the template so that an extended duplex is formed. The sequence of nucleotides added during the extension process are determined by the sequence of the template polynucleotide. Usually primers are extended by a DNA polymerase. Primers usually have a length in the range of from 14 to 36 nucleotides.",

Such transfer may result in temporary or transient expression of a transgene or temporary or transient transcription of an RNA in a target mammalian cell, for example, because of exhaustion of genetic material, loss or degradation of genetic material, lack of replication of genetic material, or the like. In some embodiments, \u201ctransfection\u201d means \u201cstable transfection\u201d as the latter term is commonly used, e.g. Kim et al, Anal. Bioanal. Chem., 379: 3173-3178 (2010). Exogenous genetic material may include plasmids, viral vectors, transgenes, transposons, or the like. \u201cStable\u201d as used herein means that the exogenous genetic material persists through multiple cell divisions or for the life, or substantially for the life, of the cellular host.

One type of vector is a \u201cplasmid,\u201d which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \u201crecombinant expression vectors\u201d (or simply, \u201crecombinant vectors\u201d). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \u201cplasmid\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector."
