                        "Insulin secretion from islet \u03b2-cells is initiated by the cholinergic parasympathetic stimulation of \u03b2-cells (the so-called \u201ccephalic phase\u201d) and subsequently potentiated during the enteric \u201cabsorptive phase\u201d (D'Alessio et al., 2001, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 86:1253-1259). In response to mechanical and chemical sensor stimulation along the digestive tract, intestinal hormones like the incretins GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide) potentiate insulin secretion directly and indirectly, through neuronal stimulation (the \u201cincretin effect\u201d) (Karlsson et al., 1992, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 213:145-146; Balkan et al., 2000, Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol., 279:R1449-1454). Progressively, nutrient absorption and blood glucose rise stimulate insulin secretion directly (\u201cpost absorptive phase\u201d) (Straub et al., 2002, Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev., 18:451-463). Altogether, different secretagogues act synergistically and trigger the adequate biphasic release of insulin from \u03b2-cells. These secretagogues reach islet endocrine cells through the vascular and neural networks. Pancreas innervation consists of parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent fibers, which are branches of the parasympathetic vagus nerve and the sympathetic splanchnic nerves. The vagal input stimulates insulin secretion via cholinergic (i.e. mediated by acetylcholine, Ach) or non-cholinergic mechanisms. Sympathetic postganglionic terminal nerves release noradrenaline or other peptides on endocrine cells repressing insulin and somatostatin secretion, and promoting glucagon release. The afferent sensory fibers innervate the periphery of islets and release peptides, like the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) repressing insulin secretion (Pettersson and Ahren, 1990, Diabetes Res., 15:9-14).",
                        "Insulin secretion insufficiency is responsible for diabetes mellitus (DM). There are two major forms of diabetes mellitus: insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) which accounts for about 5 to 10% of all cases, and non-insulin-dependent (Type II) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or T2DM) which accounts for roughly 90% of all cases. In type I diabetes, \u03b2-cell loss is due to an autoimmune reaction. In type II diabetes, increased peripheral insulin resistance challenges the functional \u03b2-cell mass: after an initial attempt at overriding the increased insulin demand, \u03b2-cell function and number decline progressively, resulting in a large spectrum of conditions that require different prescriptions. Diabetes mellitus affects more than 150 million adults and is one of the leading causes of mortality in the world. Generally, when T2DM is diagnosed, global \u03b2-cell function is already reduced by about 50%.",
                        "Enhancement of insulin secretion in type II diabetic patients is promoted with drugs such as sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZD) or GLP-1 receptor agonists, but these treatments do not prevent \u03b2-cell exhaustion. Oral anti-diabetics (insulin sensitizers and secretagogues) are found useful during the first stages of the disease when insulin resistance predominates and an insulin pancreatic reserve is still available. However, as pancreatic impairment progresses, basal insulin level starts to be an essential parameter to control for achieving metabolic control in patients. At a later stage of T2DM progression, only a basal-bolus regimen of insulin is able to maintain homeostasis in most patients. Currently, no treatment can stably restore a physiological profile of insulin secretion, leading to diabetes progression and development of serious complications.",
                        "Therefore, there is huge heath and economical needs for the development of new treatments for managing insulin secretion insufficiency and in particular new treatment for diabetes mellitus, notably T2DM.",
                        "Nogo-A, also known as reticulon-4 or neurite outgrowth inhibitor, is a high molecular weight membrane synaptic protein mostly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), notably in oligodendrocytes and in subsets of neurons (Chen et al., 2000, Nature, 403:434-439). Nogo-A expression is not restricted to the CNS, but is also found in human skeletal muscle cells (Jokic et al., 2005, Ann. Neurol., 57:553-556). In the intact CNS, Nogo-A appears to have a stabilizing, growth controlling role (Montani et al., 2009, J. Biol. Chem., 284:10793-10807). Nogo-A regulates neurite growth and cell migration (Chen et al., 2000, above). In particular, Nogo-A was shown to restrict neuronal regeneration in the injured adult spinal cord and brain, and to limit plastic rearrangements and functional recovery after large CNS lesions (Schwab, 2004, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 14:118-124; Cafferty et al., 2006, J. Neurosci., 26:12242-12250). The growth inhibitory action of Nogo-A is mediated by cytoskeletal regulators, such as Rho GTPases or cofilin (Montani et al., 2009, above). Nogo-A and its receptor (NgR) are also found in synapses, where they may influence synapse stability and function (Aloy et al., 2006, Brain Cell Biol., 35, 137-56).",
                        "Nogo-A antagonists have been developed to promote CNS axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury (EP1711530; WO2004/052932; Walmsley et al., 2007, Current Pharmaceutical Design, 13(24), pp. 2470-2484(15); Yang et al., 2009, Annals of Neurology, 999, 999A)."

Nogo-A is also known as reticulon-4 or neurite outgrowth inhibitor. It includes in particular human Nogo-A which can be described by an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. It further encompasses a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. As used herein, the term Nogo-A also encompasses rat Nogo-A (SEQ ID NO: 8), bovine Nogo-A (SEQ ID NO: 9) and mouse Nogo-A (SEQ ID NO 10).

In addition, the terms Nogo-A or Nogo-A polypeptide encompass polypeptides that have a high degree of similarity or a high degree of identity with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and which polypeptides are biologically active. In particular, the terms Nogo-A or Nogo-A polypeptide encompass polypeptides substantially homologous to a protein of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an isoform or fragment thereof, e.g. which have an amino acid sequence different from that of native human Nogo-A or Nogo-A fragment because of one or more deletions, insertions or substitutions. Substantially homologous means a variant amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the native amino acid sequences, as disclosed above. The percent identity of two amino acid or two nucleic acid sequences can be determined by visual inspection and/or mathematical calculation, or more easily by comparing sequence information using known computer program used for sequence comparison such as Clustal package version 1.83. It further encompasses polypeptides which may comprise a sequence having at least one conservatively substituted amino acid, meaning that a given amino acid residue is replaced by a residue having similar physiochemical characteristics.",

For example, Nogo-A antagonists include substances which interact with Nogo Receptor (NgR) and any other receptor expressed in \u03b2-cells and compete with its ligand Nogo-A. For example, Nogo-A antagonists include small molecules, peptidomimetics, chimaeric proteins, natural or unnatural proteins, nucleic acid derived polymers (such as DNA and RNA aptamers, siRNAs, PNAs, or LNAs), fusion proteins with Nogo-A antagonizing activities, antibody antagonists such as neutralising anti-Nogo-A antibodies, or gene therapy vectors driving the expression of such Nogo-A antagonists.",

                                "The beneficial effects of an acute neutralization of Nogo-A by intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of a Nogo-A antagonist to promote insulin secretion is assayed in the following in early type II diabetic animals, homozygous mutants for the leptin receptor gene (db/db).",
                                "Young 5-week-old diabetic db/db animals in a C57BL/Ks background are treated with Nogo-A antagonist (anti-Nogo-A antibody 11C7 as described above) by intraperitoneal injection (4\u2032900 ng antibody) or intravenously in the retro-orbital capillary plexus, twice over a two-week period and a control anti-BrdU antibody. This anti-Nogo-A antibody 11C7 was earlier described for its ability, when administered intrathecally to CNS, of inhibiting Nogo-A and allowing an enhanced sprouting and regrowth of lesioned axons after spinal cord injury and stroke in adult rats (Caroni et al., 1988, Neuron., 1:85-96). One week after the second injection, the insulinemia, the glucose levels and body weight of treated random fed db/db mice are compared to that of the control group: the insulinemia of db/db fed mice treated with 11C7 tended to be higher compared to the db/db mice treated with control antibody (BrdU 13.94\u00b15.02, 11C7 32.28\u00b18.14, n=3 mice per group, P=NS), but no effect was detected on glucose levels or body weight, most probably due to high insulin resistance of peripheral tissues (data not shown).",
                                "After the 2 weeks treatment, db/db animals are submitted to different challenges in vivo as previously described (namely i.p.-GTT, glucose-induced insulin secretion by intravenously a bolus of glucose (1 g/kg), optionally supplemented with carbachol CC)). Plasma insulin levels and total pancreatic insulin content in treated db/db mice are compared to that of the control group. Further, isolated islets from treated db/db are compared to those of the control group as described above. During the i.p. GTT, db/db mice treated with 11C7 anti-Nogo-A antibody presented higher plasma insulin levels at 15 (BrdU 1.25\u00b10.08, 11C7 2.17\u00b10.15, n=3-4, P<0.005) and 60 minutes (BrdU 1.57\u00b10.04, 11C7 2.15\u00b10.07, n=3-4, P<0.005), and 90 min, as compared with db/db mice treated with BrdU (FIG. 7A). Then, the glucose-induced insulin secretion was assessed in anesthesized db/db mice, i.v. injected with glucose (1 g/kg). Upon glucose injection, 11C7-treated db/db mice presented similar plasma insulin levels, compared with BrdU-treated db/db mice (FIG. 7B), similarly to the phenotype of Nogo-A KO, where the glucose-induced insulin secretion was not affected by the inactivation of Nogo-A (FIG. 4C). Also in accordance with the phenotype of Nogo-A KO mice, when the antibody-treated db/db mice were intravenously injected with glucose (1 g/kg) together with the cholinergic analogue carbachol (CC) (0.53 \u03bcM), 11C7-treated db/db mice showed an improved insulin secretion (4-fold on average) at 5 and 20 minutes (BrdU 10.65\u00b12.14, 11C7 46.43\u00b18.00, n=3, P<0.05) compared to BrdU-treated db/db mice (FIG. 7C).",
                                "In order to investigate the insulin secretion capacity of antibody-treated db/db mice, the pancreatic insulin content by immunoassay was assessed as described in Example 2. The inventors reasoned that the higher insulin secretion observed in db/db mice treated with Nogo-A neutralizing antibody could result from a higher parasympathetic input and/or from higher \u03b2-cell cholinergic sensitivity, such as in Nogo-A KO mice. Parasympathetic tone was therefore indirectly assessed by measuring the plasma level of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) after 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)-induced neuroglycopenia. After overnight fasting, before and after 2DG injection, PP levels were similar in both anti-Nogo-A treated and anti-BrdU treated control db/db mice (data not shown). Similarly, GIP levels were also measured in random-fed animals showing, as in Nogo_a KO mice, that before and after 2DG injection, GIP levels were similar in both anti-Nogo-A treated and anti-BrdU treated control db/db mice (FIG. 7D) (n=5, P=NS). Altogether, these results indicate that the antibody-mediated neutralization of Nogo-A does not affect the vagal and incretin input on \u03b2-cells. \u03b2-cell responsiveness to secretagogues was studied using isolated db/db islets cultured in the presence of glucose supplemented with CC (100 \u03bcM) or GLP-1 (100 nM). As observed with Nogo-A KO islets, islets from anti-Nogo-A treated db/db mice displayed higher insulin secretion in the presence of glucose supplemented with CC (n=7-15, P<0.005), yet their sensitivity to glucose supplemented with GLP-1 was not affected (FIG. 7E).",
                                "Altogether, these observations show that the intravenous administration of neutralizing Nogo-A antibody promotes the in vivo insulin secretion in 5-week-old diabetic db/db mice. Contrary to Nogo-A animals, the higher insulin secretion observed in 11C7-treated db/db mice probably resulted from a higher parasympathetic input only, as the parasympathetic input on islets was not altered. Therefore, those results support that reducing Nogo-A activity is of potential benefit for an anti-diabetic treatment, acting on the stimulatory input and the \u03b2-cells, by promoting insulin secretion in response to cholinergic stimuli, like after food intake, without hypoglycemic events.",
