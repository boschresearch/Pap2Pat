    "abstract": "Continuous device downsizing and circuit complexity have motivated atomic-scale tuning of memristors. Herein, we report atomically tunable Pd/M1/M2/Al ultrathin (<2.5 nm M1/M2 bilayer oxide thickness) memristors using in vacuo atomic layer deposition by controlled insertion of MgO atomic layers into pristine Al 2 O 3 atomic layer stacks guided by theory predicted Fermi energy lowering leading to a higher high state resistance (HRS) and a reduction of oxygen vacancy formation energy. Excitingly, memristors with HRS and on/off ratio increasing exponentially with M1/M2 thickness in the range 1.2\u20132.4 nm have been obtained, illustrating tunneling mechanism and tunable on/off ratio in the range of 10\u2013104. Further dynamic tunability of on/off ratio by electric field is possible by designing of the atomic M2 layer and M1/M2 interface. This result probes ways in the design of memristors with atomically tunable performance parameters.",

                "nterest in neuromorphic computing has been steadily increasing in recent years, due to its potential to circumvent the Von Neumann bottleneck which arises from the extra energy and time required to transport data between memory and processor units during computation 1,2 . Spearheaded by improvements in resistive random access memory (RRAM), researchers have attempted to mimic biological neuron and synapse operation by using artificial versions of these elements known as memristors 3 . In memristors, the operations of both non-volatile memory storage and low-power computing are integrated in one device, taking advantage of the computing strengths of a neural system, namely pattern recognition and unstructured data sorting 4 . RRAM may be used to implement multiple resistance states and thus serve as trainable synapses in neural networks [5][6][7] . However, as the field of memristors, RRAM, and neuromorphic computing evolves, the ability to tune the memristive resistance, switching speed, cycling endurance, among other performance criteria, at the atomic scale will be important as device architectures evolve and potentially require devices with different performance capabilities closely integrated together. Control over these performance parameters of memristors at the atomic scale will become critically important to the success of neuromorphic computing [2][3][4][8][9][10][11] .",
                "Memristors 12,13 are two-terminal devices typically consisting of an Ohmic and a Schottky electrode sandwiching a thin insulator, featuring a pinched hysteresis of resistance 1 realized through the bipolar switching of two different serially connected resistors or a double-layer (M1/M2) dielectric oxide film. Alternatively, a unipolar memristor is normally comprised of two Schottky interfaces on either side of a thin insulator. The mobile species in the switching layer, typically oxygen vacancies (V O ), can be driven back and forth in the M1/M2 film to create a conductive filament (CF). In this switching mechanism, a positive bias (SET) creates an electric field that in conjunction with joule heating causes V O from the vacancy rich M2 layer to diffuse through the higher quality dielectric M1 layer and form a CF, setting the memristor to the low resistance state (LRS). The opposite effect occurs when applying a negative voltage (RESET) and the CF is ruptured through V O diffusion and the memristor is reset to the high resistance state (HRS). Unipolar resistors experience the same CF formation to switch their resistance states, but SET and RESET may occur at both positive and negative bias voltages assisted by a compliance current.",
                "Since the pioneering work by S. Williams in demonstration of the first Pt/TiO 2 /TiO x /Ti memristor 1 , many dielectric materials have been studied for memristors using both physical vapor deposition (PVD) such as sputtering, evaporation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) such as atomic layer deposition (ALD). A myriad of metal-oxides 1,14-28 have been utilized for their compatibility with common electrodes selected to form Ohmic and Schottky contacts, their CMOS compatibility, and their high level of performance in memristors 29 . On/off (defined as HRS/ LRS) ratios in the 10 2 -10 3 range are acceptable for memristor operation, but many memristors have demonstrated higher on/off ratios up to 10 5 -10 630-32 . Some memristors have achieved switching speeds as low as ~100 ps 33 , though typical memristors show switching speeds in the ~10 ns range 3 , and low-power switching as low as 115 fJ 34 . The read/write endurance of the devices has also been observed as high as 10 12 cycles 17 .",
                "In current memristors, V O are a part of many other defects present in the M1/M2 structure as the stack is often fabricated purposely as a \"poor oxide\" to facilitate CF formation. However, the lack of control of other unwanted defects has serious consequences such as electric leakage and charge traps that in turn impact memristor parameters including M1/M2 thickness, endurance, switching speed/power, on/off ratio, etc. The most sensitive mechanism leading to defect formation in M1/M2 bilayer is the defective metal-insulator interfacial layer (IL). A defective IL can extend the defective microstructure into the M1/M2 layers grown on top and add a defective section to the entire oxide stack through a series connection. Consequently, M1/M2 films are typically made with large thicknesses in the range of 4-12 nm or more to prevent electrical leakage [35][36][37][38][39] . A defective metal-insulator IL can be caused via formation of native metal oxide and other defects on the metal surface due to the exposure of metal to air or oxygen in ex vacuo processes, difficulties in precise stoichiometric control of metal oxide composition, and formation of growth defects. Even in ALD M1/M2 made in vacuo, poor nucleation and island growth of the initial ALD cycles on metals such as Pt, Au, Pd often leads to a so-called incubation layer or defective metal-insulator IL 29,[40][41][42][43] . Besides the detrimental effect on memristor performance, the presence of unintended defects in M1/ M2 makes it difficult to precisely determine memristive switching and conduction mechanisms due to the wide range in M1/M2 thicknesses to accommodate the leakage issue, and large nonuniformity due to lack of defect control at atomic scales, resulting in evidence of numerous conduction mechanisms (Schottky emission 44 , Poole-Frenkel emission 45 , trap assisted tunneling 46 , direct tunneling 47 , or a combination of mechanisms 46,48 ) and switching mechanisms (though primarily CF formation 29,49,50 in metal oxides). Therefore, elimination of the unintended defects in the M1/M2 stack is crucial to tuning of the V O concentration for ultrathin memristor in a controllable manner.",
                "This work explores atomic tuning of ultrathin Al 2 O 3 memristors using an in vacuo ALD process by controllably introducing V O from the \"pristine\" limit of ALD-Al 2 O 3 grown on Al as an ideal insulator with a negligible metal-insulator IL as we demonstrated recently in Josephson tunnel junctions and capacitors of ultrathin (sub-nm to sub-5 nm) ALD-Al 2 O 3 tunnel barriers and dielectric films [51][52][53][54] . Specifically, we have shown that a negligible metal-insulator IL would lead to an enhanced ALD-Al 2 O 3 tunnel barrier height (E b also known as conduction band minimum) by up to 80% from ~1.0 eV for its counterpart grown on a defective native AlO x IL 51 . Furthermore, the E b is thickness independent without an IL as the ALD-Al 2 O 3 tunnel barrier thickness is varied from 0.11 to 1.1 nm. These, together with the hard dielectric breakdown demonstrated confirms that ultrathin ALD-Al 2 O 3 on Al electrode is indeed a pristine dielectric. If the V O required for memristive switch could be introduced with control at an atomicscale, the resulting memristors may have fully tunable device parameters by eliminating other unwanted defects.",
                "In order to dope ALD-Al 2 O 3 with V O , a density functional theory (DFT) study was carried out, which revealed that doping Mg in Al 2 O 3 can: (1) lower the Fermi energy of Al 2 O 3 and hence make it more insulating for higher HRS; and (2) lower the V O formation energy to promote V O formation. Experimentally, the atomically controlled Mg doping was explored using in vacuo ALD through artificial stacking of ALD-MgO and ALD-Al 2 O 3 atomic layers with the desired number of ALD-MgO layers in selected locations. Remarkably, tunability of the on/off ratio in the range of 10-10 4 has been obtained in the M1/M2 thickness range of 1.2-2.4 nm. With the addition of each atomic oxide layer to the M1/M2 stack, we show that the HRS and on/off ratio increase exponentially, confirming that tunneling is the primary conduction mechanism when the device is in HRS. Therefore, this result illustrates a promising approach for atomic-scale tuning of memristors."

                        "DFT simulations of V O doping of pristine Al 2 O 3 for memristors. Figure 1a shows schematically the defects typically formed in a memristor with a M1/M2 stack, in which the M1 layer is intended to be a higher quality insulator while M2 is a \"poorer\" quality dielectric intended to have more V O . The presence of other unintended defects including interstitials, vacancies of metals, nonuniform V O clusters, and various growth defects implies that the formation of CFs may be highly nonuniform during the memristor SET/RESET operation. In particular, some of these defects may lead to formation of leakage channels and large CFs, which can lead to poor endurance and prevent the achievement of ultrathin memristors with atomic tunability. Figure 1b shows an ultrathin Al 2 O 3 pristine dielectric on an Al electrode obtained using in vacuo ALD with a negligible metalinsulator IL (similar to the tunnel barriers we reported for tunnel junctions and dielectric for capacitors) 51,54 , in which there are insufficient V O for proper memristive switching. By introducing V O with atomic control (Fig. 1b), atomically tunable ultrathin memristors could be achieved.",
                        "In order to explore the atomic doping of pristine Al 2 O 3 , DFT simulations at the hybrid functional level were carried out. Among candidates analyzed, Mg-doping was revealed to be beneficial for memristor applications. In Fig. 2 . The slope of the lines indicates the charge state of each defect. These formation energy diagrams shed light on the role of Mg doping, as the requirement of charge neutrality will determine the actual position of the Fermi level. In the absence of Mg, the native defects with lowest formation energy, and thus those that are most likely to form, are V Al , V O , and Al i . These will lead to a Fermi level position within the gray area (Fig. 2a, Al rich conditions) or vertical dashed line (Fig. 2b, O rich). Once Mg is added, the likely Fermi level position will shift towards the valence band maximum, as indicated by the arrows and the solid vertical lines. Note that these are the results for the two extremes of chemical potentials, namely Al rich and O rich. In typical ALD growth, neither of these conditions is representative. To better mimic ALD growth conditions, we set the O chemical potential to -0.65 eV in Fig. 2c 55 . Again, the same behavior is observed: doping with Mg, which acts as a deep acceptor, lowers the Fermi level during growth. This downward shift has two important consequences: (1) a lower Fermi level indicates that the Mg-doped Al 2 O 3 will be more insulating and thus more resistive in the HRS, as confirmed later by our experimental measurements, and (2) at these lower Fermi levels the formation energy of V O is lower, indicating that more V O will be formed. V O are typically double donors in binary oxides (and confirmed by our calculations), implying that their formation energy will be lower for lower Fermi levels. At the same time oxides are usually unintentionally n-type doped 56 . This lower Fermi level would render the material more insulating by compensating for the presence of donor defects. Both are desirable to improve the performance of Al 2 O 3 -based memristors.",
                        "Atomically-controlled V O doping guided by DFT simulations. Experimentally, Mg doping in Al 2 O 3 may be achieved by insertion of an MgO atomic layer into Al 2 O 3 atomic layer stacks grown on Al. Since ALD growth can truly occur layer by layer by carefully controlling the metal-insulator interface and ALD conditions, the MgO/ Al 2 O 3 atomic layer stacks obtained using in vacuo ALD allow atomic-scale controlled V O doping 53,57 . Figure 3 3a, row iii with a large E b of 1.79 eV and hard dielectric breakdown. In the memristive SET/RESET operation on this device, no sustainable memristive switches were observed except a permanent dielectric breakdown (Fig. 3a, row iv), which is consistent with the STS observation and anticipated for a pristine dielectric. This result also confirms that the M1/M2 layer for memristors differs from the tunnel barriers since the former requires charge carriers (or V O ) while the latter requires pristine insulators without mobile charge carriers.",
                        "By inserting 3 MgO atomic layers at 3rd, 6th, and 9th layer positions above the Al electrode at the bottom (Fig. 3b, row i), V O are introduced in the Al 2 O 3 atomic layers nearby (Fig. 3b, row ii). This is illustrated in the in vacuo STS dI/dV spectrum (Fig. 3b, row iii) including the rounding of the spectrum's conduction band onset from that of a pristine insulator and slightly reduced E b to 1.70 eV as compared to the case without doping in Fig. 3a. This V O doping is critical since a few memristive switches were indeed observed (Fig. 3b, row iv) despite low endurance and device yield. In our previous study, the nucleation of the ALD-MgO on Al was found to be more frustrated than ALD-Al 2 O 3 53,57 , which means we may purposely insert a single ALD-MgO atomic layer as the M2 layer on the Al electrode for increased V O amount 40,58 , followed with deposition of the subsequent M1 layer (Fig. 3c,row i). In this sample, the doped V O are primarily localized near the ohmic metal-insulator IL (Fig. 3c, row ii). Figure 3c, row iii shows a slight dip in E b of the sample down to ~1.38 eV illustrating the increased carrier doping in the M1/M2. However, unlike those samples with no M2 layer from Fig. 3a,b, the sample with one ALD-MgO atomic layer in M2 shows sustainable memristive switching (Fig. 3c, row iv). Note that the sample in Fig. 3c, row i differs from that in Fig. 3a, row i in the 1 MgO inserted at the 1st layer position above the Al electrode. The memristive switch enabled by this 1 MgO atomic layer, in contrast to straight dielectric breakdown without the MgO, indicates the importance of V O doping near the metal-insulator interface, or the so-called M2 layer. The device in Fig. 3d, row i contains 1 MgO atomic layer in M2, and 2 MgO layers in the M1 Al 2 O 3 stack. The combination of the V O doping in both M1 and M2 layers using the MgO atomic layer insertion leads to a more comprehensive V O doping effect, but similar overall barrier quality as seen in Fig. 3d, row iii, which shows a representative E b of ~1.38 eV as well. The benefit of this combination is illustrated in the sustainable switching between HRS and LRS (Fig. 3d, row iv) and high device yield ~100%. It should be noted that both samples in Fig. 3b,d, row i have 3 MgO layers. The difference in their electronic structures revealed from the in vacuo STS study indicates the number and location of the inserted MgO atomic layers are both important to atomic tuning of memristor parameters.",
                        "Figure 4 shows the results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) taken on a memristor with the same Al 2 O 3 and MgO atomic layer stacking shown in Fig. 3d. The inset of Fig. 4a exhibits the TEM sample extracted using focus ion beam (FIB) from the memristors device. Figure 4a   approximately ~2 nm in thickness, which is consistent to the ~1.9 nm thickness expected for the total 17 Al 2 O 3 and MgO atomic layers (~0.11 nm/layer) in this sample, can be clearly seen. Figure 4b exhibits a set of peaks in the HRTEM mode line profile across the Al 2 O 3 /MgO atomic layer stack thickness. Each peak in Fig. 4b represents an atomic layer in the Al 2 O 3 and MgO atomic layers stack while the valleys are the respective spacing between the neighboring atomic layers. The Al and Pd electrodes are primarily amorphous, which is expected since both metals were deposited at room temperature. However, some crystallites randomly embedded in Pd have been identified. On these crystallites, the 0.39 nm d-spacing indeed corresponds to the (100) spacing for Pd. The Al 2 O 3 /MgO atomic layer stack is amorphous. Figure 4b 3d. The EDS results identify the presence of Mg in approximately 1.5 at%, which is less than expected, but agrees with EDS limitations 59,60 . The EDS results are mostly semiquantitative, and the main finding is that Mg is in the expected region of the Al 2 O 3 /MgO atomic layer stack that is also confirmed in the chemical analysis profile (Fig. 4c,d Design of M1 layer for atomically tunable memristors. Figure 5a, b compare two memristors with 3 MgO atomic layers inserted in 1st, 4th, and 7th layer positions (similar to that in Fig. 3d, row i) while the total M1/M2 thicknesses are 20 C (2.2 nm) and 14 C (1.5 nm) respectively. Considering the two devices both have 1 C MgO in the M2 layer and 2 MgO layers in M1 at the same positions, the major differences between the two devices are in their M1 layer thicknesses through the addition of Al 2 O 3 atomic layers. The two devices exhibit the anticipated hysteretic I-V curves which differ quantitatively in their HRS and hence on/off ratio values due to the M1 layer thicknesses. Indeed, the HRS values for the 20 and 14 C memristors are 3.98 M\u03a9 and 17.4 k\u03a9 respectively while the LRS values are comparable. This results in an on/off of ~10 4 for the 20 C memristor and ~20 for the 14 C one.",
                        "To further understand the effect of the M1 layer thickness on the memristor parameters, the HRS, LRS, on/off, and SET/RESET voltage values of memristors with a total M1/M2 layer thickness varied in the range of 11-22 C, or equivalently the M1 thickness varied from 10 to 21 C (all devices have 1 MgO layer as the M2), are illustrated in Fig. 5e, f, respectively. The HRS (blue) and on/ off ratio (black) exhibit monotonic increase with thickness and peak at M1/M2 thickness = 20 C (Fig. 5e). In the semi-log scale, this trend shows a linear curve, indicating they depend on the M1 thickness exponentially and indicate the \"tunneling\" nature of the memristive HRS conduction. This observation is important as the first demonstration of a quantitative tunability of the memristor parameters by varying the dielectric thickness. For example, the on/off ratio is tunable in the range of 10-10 4 as the M1/M2 layer thickness is varied between 11 and 22 C (1.2 and 2.4 nm). At larger thicknesses, a drop in HRS and on/off ratio can be observed. Meanwhile, LRS remains more or less constant in almost the entire thickness range likely due to the LRS consisting of series CF and wire resistances, except an upturn for 22 C, suggesting the CF formation may be incomplete. While the mechanism responsible for the HRS decrease at larger thickness above the HRS peak requires more systematic investigation, we hypothesize, based on the trends in both HRS and LRS at the large M1 thickness on the right of the HRS peak, that CF formation/annihilation may become difficult or incomplete above a critical thickness. This argument is plausible considering the tunnel mechanism of memristors revealed in Fig. 5e. In fact, the tunnel barrier thickness is typically in the range of 1-2 nm due to an exponential decrease in tunneling probability with the barrier thickness [61][62][63] .",
                        "Figure 5f, displays the average SET and RESET voltages of the memristors shown in Fig. 5e. A fairly constant SET voltage of 1.0-1.5 V and RESET voltage of -2.0 to -3.5 V were observed on these devices. These values are in the range typical of metaloxides cataloged in research, which has shown a wide range for SET (0.70-3.0 V) and RESET (-0.70 to -3.5 V) voltages 29,64,65 .",
                        "SET and RESET voltages are typically more dependent on diffusivity and switching pulse programming parameters (compliance current, pulse length, etc.) and mostly independent of material selection in metal oxides [66][67][68][69] . A possible explanation for the slight deviation from the trend with the 11 C thick sample, is that it was possible to SET at a lower voltage due to the much lower HRS (~10 3 \u03a9) compared to the next point in the set (~10 4 \u03a9). With the added HRS and on/off ratio with increased M1 layer thickness, it is apparent that this layer is the primary provider of resistance in the resistive switching mechanism in these devices.",
                        "Effect of metal-insulator IL on memristor performance. It should be noted that all devices in Fig. 5 have 1 MgO atomic layer as the M2 in the M1/M2 stack. In order to understand the difference made by this ALD-M2 layer from an M2 layer made with other methods, another set of memristors was fabricated with an ALD-Al 2 O 3 M1 layer on a defective aluminum oxide M2 formed through oxygen diffusion into an Al electrode (Th-AlO x ) under controlled oxygen pressure and exposure time at room temperature. The microstructure of the Th-AlO x is schematically shown in Fig. 1a and a nonuniform distribution of V O in the form of atomic defects and clusters and other defects are anticipated. Such a nonideal defect structure is held responsible for the tunnel barrier leakage when Th-AlO x thickness is <0.6 nm, and low barrier height E b \u00ab 1.0 eV 51 . This is in contrast to the atomic V O in the ALD-MgO M2 layer. The defective Th-AlO x M2 layer has a direct impact on the quality of the ALD-M1 layer grown on top by extending the defective structure into M1, which in turn affects the E b of the M1 as shown schematically in Fig. 6a,b. This argument is confirmed in the in vacuo STS study of the electronic structures of the ALD-M1 layers on the two kinds of the M2 layers. Figure 6c shows a representative STS dI/dV spectrum taken on the M1 consisting of 2 MgO layers inserted on the 4th and 7th layer positions in 6 Al 2 O 3 atomic layers on 1 ALD-MgO M2 layer similar to Fig. 3d, row i. The average E b of 1.45 \u00b1 0.08 eV was observed on this sample. Comparatively, Fig. 6d shows an STS dI/dV spectrum of 10 Al 2 O 3 layers grown on the Th-AlO x M2 layer (~1 nm in thickness) with an average E b of 0.75 \u00b1 0.01 eV as reported previously 51,52 . It should be noted that the higher E b value denotes a higher quality insulator with a lower defect concentration. The much reduced E b value on the ALD-Al 2 O 3 M1 layer confirms that the defects in the Th-AlO x M2 layer indeed extend into the M1 layer and degrade the dielectric quality of the M1 layer 52,70 , which in turn impacts the performance of the memristors.",
                        "By observing the log-scale plot of both HRS and LRS (Fig. 6e), a trend of exponential increase in HRS with M1/M2 total thickness can be observed over certain ranges for both kinds of memristors with either 1 ALD-MgO M2 (solid blue) or Th-AlO x M2 (open blue) layer. The LRS values remain fairly constant in the former (solid red) while some random jumps are visible on the latter (open red), which are likely due to the randomness and nonuniformity of defects in the Th-AlO x 24,35,36,71 . An example of this can be seen in both Al 2 O 3 (5 C)/Th-AlO x andAl 2 O 3 (8 C)/ Th-AlO x memristors which show almost no change in HRS even with the added 3 C of dielectric in the M1 layer. In fact, the monotonic increasing M1/M2 thickness dependence of HRS occurs only at larger thickness above 17 C total thickness for memristors with on Th-AlO x M2 layer. This is in contrast to the case of the memristors with an ALD-MgO M2 layer, the total M1/ M2 layer thickness can be thinner, down to 11 C total with an on/ off ratio >10. To our knowledge, this represents the smallest thickness among the ALD-based memristors reported 38,72 .",
                        "In order to quantify the effect of the two kinds of the M2 layers on memristor parameters, we fit the resistance-area (RA) product as function of M1/M2 thickness with the following tunneling current equations:",
                        "Where G is the conductance of the device, R is the HRS, A is the device area, m e is the mass of the electron, d is the thickness of the tunnel barrier or M1/M2 thickness in memristors, and E T is the total barrier height. The fitting of the memristors with the 1 ALD-MgO M2 layer in Fig. 6f results in an E T of 2.64 \u00b1 0.01 eV, while the fitting of memristors on the Th-AlO x M2 showed significantly lower E T of 1.94 \u00b1 0.01 eV. The higher E T in the former implies a higher specific tunability of HRS per thickness. Note that the fitted E T values in both sets of memristors are higher than the E b values measured from STS dI/dV spectra. This is different from the tunnel junction case in which the STS measured E b agrees well with the E T through fitting of device tunneling resistance vs tunnel barrier thickness curve 51 . This difference can be attributed to the presence of a Schottky barrier (V Sch ) in memristors while tunnel junctions have two Ohmic contacts, which means E T = V Sch + E b for memristors. Subtracting the E b from E T for the corresponding memristors results in V Sch values of 1.19 \u00b1 0.08 and 1.19 \u00b1 0.01 eV for the memristors on the ALD-MgO and Th-AlO x M2 respectively. This means that the Schottky barrier adds an additional barrier height of 1.19 eV when forming between the Pd electrode and ALD-Al 2 O 3 and works in conjunction with the E b to provide extremely high resistances at small read voltages. The much higher E b and hence E T values in the memristors on 1 ALD MgO M2 layer indicates the unintended defects, especially those with high nonuniformity and large dimensions potentially causing leakage, low device yield, and endurance can be minimized in the ALD MgO M2 layer. Furthermore, the comparable electronic structure of the M1 layer grown on top of this ALD MgO M2 layer suggests that the V O doping in this M2 layer is atomic, which does not lead to defective structures on the M1 layer grown on top.",
                        "Design of M2 layer for dynamic tunability. Figure 7 compares eight memristors in terms of their HRS (blue), LRS (red), on/off ratios (black) (Fig. 7a), initial (black) and stabilized (blue) HRS (Fig. 7b), and the device yield (Fig. 7c). Memristors 1-7 have the same M1/M2 thickness (17 C or 1.9 nm) but with different numbers and stacking orders of ALD-Al 2 O 3 and ALD-MgO layers grown on an Al electrode (inset of Fig. 7c). Memristor 8 has 8 C of ALD-Al 2 O 3 on the Th-AlO x M2 layer, which is ~1 nm (total M1/ M2 thickness also ~1.9 nm). The architectures in these eight memristors were selected to shed light on the role of V O doping by insertion of MgO atomic layers. Samples 1 and 2 used three MgO layers inserted in M1 but not in the M2 layer meaning few V O present at the Ohmic metal-insulator interface. This explains the very low device yields of these two samples (Fig. 7c) and very low endurance (devices failed after the first few memristive switches), signifying that the V O in M1 through the insertion of 3 MgO layers was not sufficient to repeatedly form CFs and instead resulted in permanent dielectric breakdown for a large portion of the devices. The failure suggests that V O in M2 is essential to sustainable formation of CFs during memristive switches. This argument is supported by the considerably improved device yield in Sample 3 that contains 1 MgO in M2 but no MgO in M1. Furthermore, Samples 4-7 have MgO inserted in both M1 and M2 with improved device yield up to 100% in Samples 4, 5, and 7 indicating that it is the combination of the V O doping in both M1 and M2 that enables the sustainable CF formation required for highperformance memristive switches. This indicates that these intermittent ALD-MgO layers in the M1 layer can assist in the formation of CFs as a relay for transferring charge to ionize stabilized neutral V O 73 . Sample 8 has a similar structure to Sample 3 (with 1 MgO in M2) except with a ~1 nm thick Th-AlO x in M2 with various defects expected as shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The much degraded memristor performance includes reduced HRS, on/ off ratio and device yield (~80%) in Sample 8, as compared to Sample 3 as well as Samples 4-7, illustrates the critical importance in controlling unwanted defects in the M1/M2 stack to eliminate their negative impact on CF formation via atomic V O diffusion. The location of the inserted MgO layers in M1 may have subtle effects on the memristor performance. For example, Sample 5 has the top-most MgO very close to the Schottky interface which seems to decrease the HRS and on/off as compared to Sample 4 that exhibits the highest HRS and on/off among the eight samples shown in Fig. 7. This means that the Mg-doping in Al 2 O 3 may reduce V sch due to the Fermi energy reduction and the corresponding shift of the E b . On the other hand, inserting MgO layers in M1 directly on top of the MgO in M2, such as in Sample 6 (1 MgO in M1 on top of the MgO in M2) and 7 (2 MgO in M1 on top of the MgO in M2), leads to slightly reduced HRS and on/off ratio values in these samples as compared to that in Sample 4. This suggests that the additional MgO layers grown directly on the 1 MgO M2 may increase the V O concentration in M1, making M1 less insulating. Interestingly, these two samples show an R 0 value in the 10 4 \u03a9 range, but when forced to reset during the initial memristive switches, the HRS goes up to the 10 5 \u03a9 range (Fig. 7b). This is in contrast to the nearly identical R 0 and HRS observed in Sample 4. Note that the other samples (except for samples 4, 6, and 7) show lower stabilized HRS after a few initial memristive switches possibly due to dielectric breakdown (Samples 1 and 2), inadequate amount of V O in M1 to support sustainable memristive switches (Sample 3), reduction of the V sch (Sample 5), and presence of other defects originated from the Th-AlO x M2 (Sample 8). Therefore, the increase from lower R 0 to higher stabilized HRS indicates that unlike the other samples in Fig. 7, there may be an excess of V O locally formed at the M1/M2 interface due to Mg-doping by the inserted MgO layers in Samples 6 and 7. Note the increased resistance expected from Mg-doping in pristine Al 2 O 3 predicted from our DFT simulation in Fig. 2 would only occur partially before the localized V O are driven out of the M1/M2 interface by the electric field. This means that the number and location of MgO atomic layers in M1 would allow schemes to dynamically tune the memristor parameters using an electric field. After the dynamic tuning, Samples 6 and 7 have on/off ratio increased by up to an order of magnitude with a device yield of 92% for Sample 6 and 100% for Sample 7."

                        "In conclusion, atomic-scale controlled V O doping of ultrathin pristine Al 2 O 3 has been explored in this work by insertion of MgO atomic layers into Al 2 O 3 atomic layer stacks grown using in vacuo ALD for atomically tunable memristors. Two effects of Mg doping in pristine Al 2 O 3 are revealed in our DFT simulations: reduction of the Fermi energy and hence increase of the resistivity, and increased generation of V O , both desirable for high performance memristors. These two effects are both experimentally confirmed through a comparative study of memristor performance parameters with respect to the number and location of the inserted MgO atomic layers in the MgO/Al 2 O 3 atomic layer stacks. Excitingly, this allows atomically tunable memristors to be achieved. Within the M1/M2 thickness of 1.2-2.4 nm, we show that the HRS can be tuned continuously over three orders of magnitude, leading to an on/off ratio tunable in the range of 10-10 4 in this thickness range. Furthermore, dynamically tunable on/off ratio by up to one order of magnitude was obtained by arranging the MgO atomic layers at the M1/M2 interface. Finally, an exponentially decreasing tunneling conductance with increasing M1/M2 thickness demonstrates that tunneling is the dominant HRS conduction mechanism of these memristors while the tunnel barrier height E T = E b + V sch is determined by the M1/M2 barrier height E b and the Schottky barrier V sch meaning that the Schottky and tunnel barriers work in tandem to limit current. In vacuo STS dI/dV characterization has revealed that higher E b up to 1.45 eV can be obtained in less defective MgO/Al 2 O 3 M1/M2 grown on Al electrode with a negligible metal-insulator interface, in contrast to much lower E b 0.75 eV when a defective native oxide IL is present. Nevertheless, the V sch of 1.19 eV can be maintained at the Pd/Al 2 O 3 Schottky interface. This result shows a promising approach for design and fabrication of ultrathin memristors tunable at an atomic scale."

                        "A set of ultrathin memristors with M1/M2 bilayer structure composed of ALD-Al 2 O 3 (ALD-MgO)/ALD-MgAlO x (all ALD memristors) were fabricated using in vacuo ALD. A selected number of ALD-MgO layers were inserted for tuning of the electronic structure and V O concentration of the M1 and M2 layer. The thickness of the M1 layer was varied in the range of (0.6-2.3 nm). Since each ALD-Al 2 O 3 or ALD-MgO atomic layer has a thickness of ~0.11 nm 74,75 , the resolution of the thickness control is truly atomic via controlling the number of M1 ALD-Al 2 O 3 /MgO atomic layers in the range of 5-21. The memristors were defined using a shadow mask to allow 12 memristors to be fabricated on each chip with three different areas of 200 \u00d7 200, 200 \u00d7 300, and 200 \u00d7 400 \u03bcm 2 for uniformity examination. DC magnetron sputtering of Al and Pd electrodes was carried out in our in vacuo ALD system 76 at a base pressure of < 5 \u00d7 10 -7 Torr, using an Ar plasma (14 mTorr/90 W for Al deposited at 0.5 nm/s, 30 mTorr/45 W for Pd deposited at 1 nm/s, sample distance of ~6 cm). Specifically, the Si/SiO 2 (500 nm) substrate was transferred to the sputtering chamber from a load-lock chamber via a transfer rod where an Al electrode was deposited. To make the M1/M2 layer, the ALD chamber was preheated to a temperature of ~225 \u00b0C, followed by sample transfer into the ALD chamber and dynamically heating for 25 min with blackbody radiation from the sides of the chamber. Dynamic heating meaning that the sample was not in full thermal equilibrium at the beginning of the ALD, but that the temperature was in the optimal range (starting at ~177 \u00b0C) 40 and would continue to slowly rise towards 225 \u00b0C during further ALD growth. This dynamic heating was found critical to minimizing metal-insulator IL formation at the Al interface caused by excessive heating times needed to reach proper thermal equilibrium 51,52,70 . The sample was then subjected to alternating 2 s long precursor pulses of H 2 O and either Trimethyl-Aluminum (TMA) at room temperature or Bis(cyclopentadienyl)magnesium(II) (MgCp 2 ) heated to 100 \u00b0C assisted by a flow of 5 SCCM of N 2 . Between each precursor pulse the ALD chamber was purged for 35 s using N 2 and a vacuum pump. The precursor pulses were fully computer controlled to allow ALD-MgO and ALD-Al 2 O 3 atomic layers to be stacked in any order or amount desired. Since each of the Al 2 O 3 and MgO atomic layers is only ~0.1 nm, the doping effect by MgO in Al 2 O 3 in an Al 2 O 3 /MgO film of 1-2 nm thickness is expected to be similar to \"Mg\" uniformly distributed in 3D volume of a bulk MgO-doped Al 2 O 3 sample 77 . Once the M1/M2 was grown the sample was transferred in vacuo back to a high vacuum chamber to let it cool in a low oxygen environment. Post-cooling, the sample was then removed from vacuum and the 2nd shadow mask was mounted for deposition of the top Pd electrode. For comparison, a set of memristors with 1 nm defective Th-AlO x M2 and ALD M1 were fabricated with total M1/M2 thickness ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 nm. For these samples the main difference was that the sample was allowed to cool post Al deposition, and then placed in the loadlock chamber to undergo oxidation using high purity O 2 at ~2 Torr for 520 s resulting in ~1040 Torr s, which is estimated to result in approximately 1 nm of defective Th-AlO x oxide M2 layer 51 .",
                        "Ex Vacuo sample characterization. Electrical measurements of the shadow-maskfabricated samples were carried out using 25 \u00b5m tungsten probes in a probe station in conjunction with an Agilent B1500 semiconductor analyzer. The Pd electrode was grounded while the Al electrode was biased. Initial low voltage (-500 to 500 mV) sweeps of each device fabricated were performed to probe the initial resistance. HRS and LRS values were measured at 100 mV, a point at which the Schottky barrier is still effective. Very slight electroforming appears to be necessary in these devices as their first switch usually requires a slightly higher voltage than the average switching voltage. Electrode resistance from the Pd and Al wires was subtracted, because in normal photomask samples the electrodes would be thick enough so that their resistance would be negligible.",
                        "In Vacuo scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). In Vacuo STS was taken using an RHK UHV system at ~10 -10 Torr. STS samples were measured by fabricating a half-cell of the memristor structure, i.e., the fabrication steps are all the same except the sample is transferred for examination after the M2/M1 bilayer is grown. Local density of states (LDOS) was proportionately measured through dI/dV spectra collected using a mechanically cleaved PtIr tip by sweeping a DC voltage from 0 to 2.3 V with a lock-in amplifier analyzing the 45 mV 5 kHz AC signal on top of the DC signal. Approximately 60-80 spectra were randomly taken as the films were too sensitive for scanning tunneling microscopy scans. Using two bisquare fits, the intersection of the conduction band and band gap regions are estimated to estimate E b also known as the barrier height E b , as well as high-quality ALD coverage rate 51,52,57,70,78 .",
