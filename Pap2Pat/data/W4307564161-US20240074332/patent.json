                        "Interest in neuromorphic computing has been steadily increasing in recent years, due to its potential to circumvent the Von Neumann bottleneck which arises from the extra energy and time required to transport data between memory and processor units during computation. Spearheaded by improvements in resistive random access memory (RRAM) utilizing memristors, researchers have attempted to mimic biological neuron and synapse operation by using artificial versions of these elements, known as memristors. In the memristors, the operations of both non-volatile memory storage and low-power computing are integrated in one device, taking advantage of the computing strengths of a neural system, namely pattern recognition and unstructured data sorting. Considering neuromorphic computing relies on a larger array of memristors, the performance of memristors becomes critically important to the success of neuromorphic computing.",
                        "Memristors, regarded as the fourth fundamental circuit element next to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, are usually two-terminal devices made up of two electrodes sandwiching an insulator, featuring a pinched hysteresis of resistance. Most commonly, memristors are found in the form of a resistive switching layer made up of one or two metal oxides, forming a thin dielectric film between a pair of Schottky electrodes, or a Schottky and Ohmic electrode, to mimic the functionality of artificial neurons/synapses. Resistance hysteresis is realized through the bipolar switching of two different serially connected resistors or a double-layer dielectric film between which the carriers such as oxygen vacancies can be driven back and forth if the dielectric film can be well controlled at nanometer scales. In most metal-oxide barrier memristors, a filamentary switching mechanism is observed in which a positive bias on the ohmic contact creates an electric field that in conjunction with joule heating in some cases causes oxygen vacancies from the vacancy rich layer to diffuse through the higher quality dielectric layer and form a nanoscale conductive filament, setting the memristor to the low resistance state (LRS). The opposite effect occurs when applying a negative voltage and the conductive filament is ruptured through oxygen vacancy diffusion and the memristor is reset to the high resistance state (HRS)."

                        "Provided are memristors and devices comprising the same. The present approach to memristor design involves using in vacuo atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form an ultrathin dielectric stack (e.g., less than about 5 nm) of atomically thin (about 0.1 nm) sublayers of two different types of metal oxides. This allows for precise (atomically precise) positioning of metal atoms and oxygen vacancies within the dielectric stack. The number and ordering of the atomically thin sublayers affect the electronic structure of the dielectric stack and these parameters may be selected so that the memristor exhibits any desired set of properties (e.g., high resistance state (HRS), on/off ratio, total barrier height ET, switching times, device yield, etc.). Using the present approach, ultrathin memristors have been formed which exhibit unexpectedly high values for each of these properties despite the thinness of the memristors, e.g., on/off ratios of 104 for a dielectric stack of less than about 3 nm. In addition, due to the tunable nature of the present approach, other ultrathin memristors have been formed so as to span a wide range of values of these properties, e.g., HRS, on/off ratios, and switching times that span orders of magnitude, e.g., three orders of magnitude.",

                        "Memristors are provided. With reference to FIG. 7, a cross-section of an illustrative memristor 700 is shown which comprises (and in embodiments, consists of) a bottom electrode 702, a top electrode 704 (oppositely facing the bottom electrode 702), and a dielectric stack 706 between the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702. The dielectric stack 706 comprises (and in embodiments, consists of) a plurality of ALD-grown atomic sublayers. The plurality of ALD-grown atomic sublayers comprises one or more ALD-grown atomic sublayers of a first metal oxide (one of which is labeled 708a) and one or more ALD-grown atomic sublayers of a second metal oxide (one of which is labeled 710a). A top interface 712 is formed between a bottom surface of the top electrode 704 and a top surface of an uppermost ALD-grown atomic sublayer in the dielectric stack 706. This means the top electrode 704 and the uppermost ALD-grown atomic sublayer are in direct contact. A bottom interface 714 is formed between a top surface of the bottom electrode 702 and a bottom surface of a bottommost ALD-grown atomic sublayer of the dielectric stack 706. This means the bottom electrode 702 and the bottommost ALD-grown atomic sublayer are in direct contact. The \u201c:\u201d symbols in FIG. 7 are used to indicate that there may be (and generally are) other ALD-grown atomic sublayers in the dielectric stack (i.e., more than two). The other ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the plurality of ALD-grown atomic sublayers are sandwiched together to form the dielectric stack 706. In embodiments, the memristor 700 consists of the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702 and the dielectric stack 706 of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers (the number and ordering of which may vary as described below) of the first and second metal oxides (708a, 710a).",
                        "An axis is included in FIG. 7 for reference. The cross-section of the memristor 700 is taken along the xz plane; lateral dimensions of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers are taken along the xy plane; the thicknesses of individual ALD-grown atomic sublayers (e.g., 708a, 710a) and the thickness of the dielectric stack 706 are taken along the z axis, perpendicular to the plane defined by the ALD-grown atomic sublayers (e.g., 708a, 710a)/dielectric stack 706.",
                        "By \u201cALD-grown\u201d it is meant that the referenced layer has been grown via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The phrase \u201catomic sublayers\u201d is used since individual sublayers have a thickness corresponding to the diameter of the atoms making up the relevant metal oxide. This thickness is generally about 0.1 nm, which includes a thickness of 0.1 nm\u00b110%. That is, an individual ALD-grown atomic sublayer has a thickness of about 0.1 nm, which includes a thickness of 0.1 nm\u00b110%. Thicknesses of the ALD-grown sublayers may be determined with reference to the growth rates and cycles being used during the ALD process. Ellipsometry may be used to determine the growth rate for a particular metal oxide, e.g., the growth rate for Al2O3 is 0.11 to 0.12 nm/cycle.",
                        "A variety of metal oxides may be used for the first and second metal oxides that form the ALD-grown atomic sublayers (e.g., 708a, 710a) of the dielectric stack 706. For example, the first and second metal oxides may be selected from aluminum oxide (Al2O3), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), magnesium oxide (MgO), calcium oxide (CaO), beryllium oxide (BeO), cadmium oxide (e.g., CdO), zinc oxide (ZnO), and hafnium oxide (HfO2). However, the first and second metal oxides that are selected (which may be referred to as a \u201cpair\u201d) are different metal oxides from one another, i.e., different chemical compounds comprising at least one different chemical element (e.g., different metals). In addition, the first and second metal oxides of the pair are different from one another in terms of their concentration of oxygen vacancies (VO). Specifically, the pair is selected so that one of the first and second metal oxides has a greater concentration of Vo than the other. The metal oxide having the greater concentration of VO may be referred to as a \u201cpoor\u201d oxide while the metal oxide having the smaller concentration of VO may be referred to as a \u201cgood\u201d oxide. The relative VO concentration of two different oxides (e.g., poor and good oxides) may be quantified by reference to the resistivity (conductivity) or dielectric constant (capacitance) of the two different oxides. The poor oxide, having a greater concentration of VO, may be characterized by a lower resistance (higher conductivity) than the good oxide, e.g., at least an order of magnitude lower resistance (higher conductivity) to three orders of magnitude lower resistance (higher conductivity). The poor oxide, having a greater concentration of VO, may be characterized by a lower dielectric constant (lower capacitance) than the good oxide, e.g., at least three times lower dielectric constant (lower capacitance) to an order of magnitude lower dielectric constant (lower capacitance). These comparisons refer to the two oxides having been formed by the same technique (e.g., one to a few cycles of ALD using the technique and conditions descried herein) and measured using the same measurement technique. Techniques for measuring resistance (capacitance) are known, including Liu et al, Advanced Materials Interfaces, 2017 Vol. 4, Page 1601064. Techniques for measuring dielectric constant (capacitance) are known, including Achaya et al, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces vol. 10, page 3112.",
                        "Desirably, the pair is also selected such that one of the first and second metal oxides (the poor metal oxide) lowers the Fermi energy of the other of the first and second metal oxides (good metal oxide), thereby increasing the resistance of the good metal oxide. In addition, the pair is desirably selected such that the poor metal oxide lowers the VO formation energy in the good metal oxide, i.e., the energy required to form VO in the good metal oxide. Although it is not possible to predict pairs of first and second metal oxides which possess these features based on their valence states, the pairs may be determined using theoretical calculations as described in the Example, below. As also described in the Example, below, such calculations were used to discover that MgO, a poor metal oxide relative to Al2O3, unexpectedly lowers the Fermi energy and VO formation energy of Al2O3. This finding has also been experimentally confirmed, below. Thus, in embodiments, the first and second metal oxides used to form the ALD-grown atomic sublayers (e.g., 708a, 710a) of the dielectric stack 706 are Al2O3 and MgO. In embodiments, the first and second metal oxides are Ga2O3 and MgO, respectively.",
                        "In embodiments, the dielectric stack 706 of the memristor 700 includes one or more ALD grown atomic sublayers of a third metal oxide. The third metal oxide is a different chemical compound comprising at least one different chemical element (e.g., a different metal) from the first and second metal oxides. In embodiments, the first, second, and third metal oxides are Al2O3, MgO, and Ga2O3, respectively.",
                        "Various conductive materials may be used to form the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702. In embodiments, one of the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702 is an Ohmic electrode, i.e., one that forms an Ohmic contact at either the top interface 712 or the bottom interface 714, while the other of the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702 is a Schottky electrode, i.e., one that forms a Schottky contact at the other of the top interface 712 or the bottom interface 714. In embodiments, both of the top and bottom electrodes 704, 702 are Schottky electrodes. Illustrative conductive materials to form Ohmic electrodes include Al, Ti, W, and Ta. Illustrative conductive materials to form Schottky electrodes include Pd, Pt, Ag. The present memristors are distinguished from other electrical components such as capacitors that include two Ohmic electrodes, i.e., top and bottom electrodes that are Ohmic electrodes. Memristors also exhibit two distinct resistance states, a high resistance state (exhibiting a relatively higher resistance to conduction through the dielectric stack) and a low resistance state (exhibiting a relatively lower resistance to conduction through the dielectric stack) as well as the ability to switch between these two resistances states. Moreover, the resistance exhibited by the memristor varies depending upon the previous electrical charge that has flowed through the memristor. Electrical components that do not exhibit these characteristics cannot be considered to be memristors.",
                        "The present approach to memristor design allows for significant flexibility in terms of the particular number of ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the first metal oxide in the dielectric stack 706, the particular number of ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the second metal oxide in the dielectric stack 706, the total number of ALD-grown atomic sublayers in the dielectric stack 706, and the particular ordering of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers in the dielectric stack 706. Each of these parameters affects the electronic structure of the dielectric stack 706 and thus, the properties of the memristor 700. These parameters may be adjusted to achieve a desired value of HRS, on/off ratio, ET, switching speed, device yield, and combinations thereof. As such, the present approach affords an unprecedented degree of tunability in terms of memristor properties and performance.",
                        "Referring back to the memristor 700 of FIG. 7, the total number of ALD-grown atomic sublayers is generally selected so that the thickness of the dielectric stack 706 is not more than about 5 nm (which includes 5 nm\u00b110%), not more than about 4 nm (which includes 4 nm\u00b110%), not more than about 3 nm (which includes 3 nm\u00b110%), or not more than about no more than about 2 nm (which includes 2 nm\u00b110%). Thicknesses of the dielectric stack 706 may be determined as described above with respect to the individual ALD-grown atomic sublayers. Thus, the present memristors may be described as being \u201cultrathin.\u201d",
                        "By contrast, conventional memristors are significantly thicker (e.g., greater than 10 nm). This is because conventional memristors include a variety of defects (other than the desired oxygen vacancies) such as those shown in FIG. 1A. these include defects generated upon exposure of the memristor to air as the material layers thereof are being formed as well as the inherent difficulty in growing oxides on metals such as Pt, Pd, Au via ALD due to the formation of a defective nucleation layer at the metal surface. Due to such defects, the dielectric layer or bilayer of conventional memristors must be made sufficiently thick so as to minimize the negative impact of the defects on memristor performance (e.g., shorts from electrical leakage). Electrical leakage (and inability to form a memresistive switch) is evidenced by current flowing upon application of a bias voltage that increases as bias voltage increases.",
                        "The present memristors do not suffer from such defects. The lack of such defects in the present memristors is experimentally confirmed by the memristors exhibiting memresistive switching as well as high HRS, high on/off ratios, and high device yields despite the relative thinness of the dielectric stack 706. For example, FIG. 5E plots the HRS and LRS values as a function of dielectric stack thickness (total M1/M2 thickness) for illustrative memristors consisting of a dielectric stack of ALD-grown atomic sublayers of MgO and Al2O3 between top and bottom electrodes. Even the memristor having a dielectric stack thickness of only 1.21 nm exhibits an on/off ratio of greater than 10. This is believed to be the thinnest ALD-based memristor ever reported.",
                        "Illustrative memristor designs based on the present approach are shown in, e.g., FIG. 3A, panels (b)-(d); FIGS. 4A-4B; and samples 1-7 below FIG. 6C. Using FIGS. 4A and 4B as an example, these figures show memristors consisting of a dielectric stack of ALD-grown atomic sublayers of Al2O3 and MgO between top and bottom electrodes. FIG. 3A, panels (b)-(d) and samples 1-7 below FIG. 6C show similar memristors but including those having different orderings/numbers of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers of Al2O3 and MgO.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows a cross-section of another illustrative memristor 800 comprising a first ALD-grown atomic sublayer of a poor oxide (e.g., MgO) 810a positioned within a dielectric stack 806 such that it forms a bottom interface 814 with a bottom electrode 802 (and thus, is in direct contact with the bottom electrode 802). This is a feature that is avoided in some conventional memristors as it would be expected to decrease resistance when the resistance of the dielectric material is generally desired to be as high as possible. In embodiments, the bottom electrode 802 is an Ohmic electrode. Specific embodiments of the memristor 800 are shown in FIG. 3A, panels (c)-(d), FIGS. 4A-4B, and samples 3-7 below FIG. 6C. As discussed in the Example, below, use of the ALD-grown atomic sublayer of MgO directly on the Ohmic electrode of in these embodiments prevents dielectric breakdown and improves device yield (e.g., compare sample 4 below FIG. 6C to samples 1 and 2 below FIG. 6C.) In further embodiments, one or more additional (e.g., two, three, four) ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the poor oxide (e.g., MgO) are positioned within the dielectric stack 806 directly in contact with the first ALD-grown atomic sublayer of the poor oxide 810a. Such embodiments are shown in samples 6-7 below FIG. 6C. As discussed in the Example, below, these embodiments unexpectedly lead to the resulting memristor exhibiting a higher stabilized HRS as compared to an initial HRS (e.g., compare samples 6 and 7 below FIG. 6C to sample 4 below FIG. 6C).",
                        "In embodiments, including those based on memristor 800 of FIG. 8, described above, a first ALD-grown atomic sublayer of a poor oxide (e.g., MgO) is positioned within a dielectric stack such that it forms a bottom interface with a bottom electrode and a second ALD-grown atomic sublayer of the poor oxide is positioned within the dielectric stack such that it forms a top interface with a top electrode. Thus, in these embodiments, the poor oxide is positioned in direct contact with both electrodes of the memristor.",
                        "In embodiments, including those based on any of those described above, the dielectric stack of the memristor comprises at least two (e.g., two, three, four) ALD-grown atomic sublayers of a poor oxide (e.g., MgO). One of these may be positioned such that it contacts a bottom electrode, including an Ohmic electrode. The other of the at least two ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the poor oxide may be positioned within the dielectric stack such that it is sandwiched between surrounding ALD-grown atomic sublayers of a good oxide (e.g., Al2O3). Such embodiments are shown in FIG. 3A, panel (d), FIGS. 4A-4B, and samples 4-7 below FIG. 6C. As discussed in the Example, below, these embodiments lead to higher HRS, higher on/off ratios, and higher device yield (e.g., compare sample 4 below FIG. 6C to sample 3 below FIG. 6C).",
                        "In embodiments, including those based on any of those described above, the dielectric stack of the memristor is characterized by having an asymmetric distribution of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers between the top and bottom electrodes, e.g., an asymmetric distribution of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the first metal oxide between the top and bottom electrodes and an asymmetric distribution of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the second metal oxide between the top and bottom electrodes. Such embodiments are shown in FIG. 3A, panels (b), (c), and (d); FIGS. 4A-4B; and samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 below FIG. 6C. By contrast, sample 5 below FIG. 6C is characterized by a symmetric distribution of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers in which the ALD-grown atomic sublayers of the first and second metal oxides are uniformly and periodically distributed between the top and bottom electrodes. As discussed in the Example, below, asymmetric embodiments lead to higher HRS values and higher on-off ratios (e.g., compare asymmetric sample 4 below FIG. 6C to symmetric sample 5 below FIG. 6C.)",
                        "In variations of any of the asymmetric embodiments described above, the dielectric stack of the memristor may be further characterized by having all of the ALD-grown atomic sublayers of one of the first and second metal oxides (e.g., the poor oxide such as MgO) being positioned within a certain subregion of the dielectric stack, e.g., within a subregion that is no more than 60% of the thickness of the dielectric stack. This subregion may be one that is closer to one of the two electrodes than the other. Such embodiments are shown in FIG. 3A, panels (b), (c), and (d); FIGS. 4A-4B; and samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 below FIG. 6C. In other embodiments, the positioning is within a subregion that is no more than 50% of the thickness of the dielectric stack or no more than 40% of the thickness of the dielectric stack. Again, this subregion may be closer to one electrode than the other.",
                        "The asymmetric embodiments described herein result in an asymmetric distribution of the VO within the dielectric stack of the memristor, including VO distributions which are concentrated within any of the subregions described above. The asymmetric embodiments described herein represent another unique feature different from approaches used in the design of some conventional memristors wherein the goal is to achieve a uniform distribution of the metal oxides and the VO throughout the dielectric material of the memristor.",
                        "Any of the embodiments of the memristors described herein based on first and second metal oxides (e.g., Al2O3 and MgO) may include one or more ALD grown atomic sublayers of a third metal oxide (e.g., Ga2O3).",
                        "The present memristors may be characterized by their conduction mechanism through the dielectric stack thereof in the high resistance state of the memristor. As demonstrated in the Example, below, this conduction mechanism is via tunneling. This may be confirmed by measuring HRS values and on/off ratios for the memristor as a function of dielectric stack thickness and obtaining a linear slope in a semi-log scale of resistance (or voltage) versus thickness (see FIGS. 4E-4F). This is by contrast to memristors which exhibit a space charge limited conduction mechanism.",
                        "As noted above, the present memristors may be characterized by a variety of properties. Techniques for measuring these properties are described in the Example, below. In embodiments, the memristor is characterized by an ET value of greater than 1 eV, at least 1.2 eV, at least 1.4 eV, at least 1.6 eV, at least 1.8 eV, or at least 2 eV. In embodiments, the memristor is characterized by an on/off ratio of at least 10, at least 102, at least 103, at least 104, or at least 105. In embodiments, the memristor is characterized by a switching time constant of no more than 0.1 ns, no more than 1 ns, no more than 100 ns, no more than 500 ns, no more than 1 ms, or a range of from 0.1 ns to 100 ms. In embodiments, the memristor is characterized by a device yield of at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95%. These properties may be associated with any of the disclosed memristors having a dielectric stack thickness of no more than about 5 nm, including no more than about 3 nm or no more than about 1.1 nm.",

Excitingly, memristors with HRS and on/off ratio increasing exponentially with M1/M2 thickness in the range 1.2-2.4 nm have been obtained, illustrating the tunneling mechanism and a tunable on/off ratio in the range of 10-104. Further dynamic tunability of the on/off ratio by electric field is possible by designing of the atomic M2 layer and M1/M2 interface.

                                "Sample Fabrication\u2014A set of ultrathin memristors with an M1/M2 bilayer structure composed of ALD-Al2O3 (ALD-MgO)/ALD-MgAlOx (all ALD memristors) was fabricated using in vacuo ALD. A selected number of ALD-MgO layers were inserted for tuning of the electronic structure and VO concentration of the M1 and M2 layer. The thickness of the M1 layer was varied in the range of 0.6 nm-2.3 nm. Since each ALD-Al2O3 or ALD-MgO atomic layer has a thickness of \u02dc0.11 nm, the resolution of the thickness control is truly atomic via controlling the number of M1 ALD-Al2O3/MgO atomic layers in the range of 5-21. The memristors were defined using a shadow mask to allow 12 memristors to be fabricated on each chip with three different areas of 200\u00d7200, 200\u00d7300, and 200\u00d7400 \u03bcm2 for uniform examination. DC magnetron sputtering of Al and Pd electrodes was carried out in an in vacuo ALD system at a base pressure of <5\u00d710\u22127 Torr, using an Ar plasma (14 mTorr/90 W for Al, 30 mTorr/45 W for Pd). (Elliot A. J. et al., Rev Sci Instrum, 85, 073904 (2014).) Specifically, the Si/SiO2 (500 nm) substrate was transferred to the sputtering chamber from a load-lock chamber via a transfer rod where an Al electrode was deposited. To make the M1/M2 layer, the ALD chamber was preheated to a temperature of \u02dc225\u00b0 C., followed by sample transfer into the ALD chamber and dynamically heating for 25 minutes with blackbody radiation from the sides of the chamber. This dynamic heating was found critical to minimizing M/I IL formation at the Al interface. The sample was then subjected to alternating precursor pulses of H2O and either Trimethyl-Aluminum (TMA) or Bis(cyclopentadienyl)magnesium(II) (MgCp2) assisted by a flow of 5 SCCM of N2. The precursor pulses were fully computer controlled to allow the ALD-MgO and ALD-Al2O3 atomic layers to be stacked in any order or amount desired. Once the M1/M2 layer was grown, the sample was transferred in vacuo back to a high vacuum chamber to let it cool in a low oxygen environment. Post-cooling, the sample was then removed from vacuum, and the 2nd shadow mask was mounted for deposition of the top Pd electrode. For comparison, a set of memristors with 1 nm defective Th\u2014AlOx M2 and ALD M1 was fabricated with total M1/M2 thickness ranging from 1.5-3.0 nm. For these samples, the main difference was that the sample was allowed to cool post Al deposition and then was placed in the loadlock chamber to undergo oxidation using high purity O2 at \u02dc2 Torr for 520 seconds, resulting in \u02dc1040 Torr\u00b7s, which was estimated to result in approximately 1 nm of defective Th\u2014AlOx oxide M2 layer.",
                                "Ex Vacuo Sample Characterization. Electrical measurements of the shadow-mask-fabricated samples were carried out using 25 \u03bcm tungsten probes in a probe station in conjunction with an Agilent B1500 semiconductor analyzer. The Pd electrode was grounded while the Al electrode was biased. Initial low voltage (\u2212500 mV to 500 mV) sweeps of each device fabricated were performed to probe the initial resistance. HRS and LRS values were measured at 100 mV, a point at which the Schottky barrier is still effective. Very slight electroforming appeared to be necessary in these devices as their first switch usually required a slightly higher voltage than the average switching voltage. Electrode resistance from the Pd and Al wires was subtracted because in normal photomask samples the electrodes would be thick enough so that their resistance would be negligible.",
                                "In Vacuo Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) was taken using an RHK UHV system at \u02dc10\u221210 Torr. STS samples were measured by fabricating a half-cell of the memristor structure, i.e., the fabrication steps were all the same except the sample was transferred for examination after the M2/M1 bilayer was grown. Local density of states (LDOS) was proportionately measured through dI/dV spectra collected using a mechanically cleaved PtIr tip by sweeping a DC voltage from 0 to 2.3 V with a lock-in amplifier analyzing the 45 mV 5 kHz AC signal on top of the DC signal. Approximately 60-80 spectra were randomly taken as the films were too sensitive for scanning tunneling microscopy scans. Using two bisquare fits, the intersection of the conduction band and band gap regions were estimated to estimate Eb, also known as the barrier height Eb, as well as high-quality ALD coverage rate.",

                                "FIG. 1A shows schematically the defects typically formed in a memristor with a M1/M2 stack, in which the M1 layer is intended to be a higher quality insulator while the M2 layer is a \u201cpoorer\u201d quality dielectric intended to have more VO. The presence of other unintended defects including interstitials, vacancies of metals, nonuniform VO clusters, and various growth defects implies that the formation of CFs is likely to be highly nonuniform during the memristor SET/RESET operation. In particular, some of these defects may lead to the formation of leakage channels and large CFs, which can lead to poor endurance and prevent achievement of ultrathin memristors with atomic tunability. FIG. 1B shows an ultrathin Al2O3 pristine dielectric on an Al electrode obtained using in vacuo ALD with a negligible M/I IL, in which there is insufficient VO for memristive switching. However, by introducing VO with atomic control (FIG. 1B), atomically tunable ultrathin memristors may be achieved, as demonstrated below.",
                                "In order to explore the atomic doping of pristine Al2O3, DFT simulations at the hybrid functional level were carried out. Among candidates analyzed, Mg-doping in Al2O3 was revealed to be unexpectedly beneficial for memristor applications. In FIGS. 2A-2B, the calculated formation energy was plotted as a function of Fermi level (between the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum) under (FIG. 2A) Al rich and (FIG. 2B) O rich conditions, for native defects (VO, aluminum vacancy (VAl), and aluminum interstitial (Ali)) and all Mg related defects (Mg substituting on Al (MgAl) or O (MgO) sites and Mg interstitials (Mgi)). The slope of the lines indicates the charge state of each defect. These formation energy diagrams shed light on the role of Mg doping, as the requirement of charge neutrality determines the actual position of the Fermi level. In the absence of Mg, the native defects with lowest formation energy, and thus those that are most likely to form, include VAl, VO, and Ali. These will lead to a Fermi level position within the grey area (FIG. 2A, Al rich conditions) or vertical dashed line (FIG. 2B, O rich). Once Mg is added, the likely Fermi level position will shift towards the valence band maximum, as indicated by the arrows and the solid vertical lines. Note that these are the results for the two extremes of chemical potentials, namely Al rich and O rich. In typical ALD growth, neither of these conditions is representative. To better mimic ALD growth conditions, the O chemical potential was set to \u22120.65 eV in FIG. 2C. Again, the same behavior was observed: doping with Mg, which acts as a deep acceptor, lowered the Fermi level during growth. This downward shift has two important consequences: (1) a lower Fermi level indicates that the Mg-doped Al2O3 will be more insulating and thus more resistive in the HRS, as confirmed later by experimental measurements, and (2) at these lower Fermi levels, the formation energy of VO was lower, indicating that more VO will be formed. VO are typically double donors in binary oxides (and confirmed by the inventors' calculations), implying that their formation energy will be lower for lower Fermi levels. At the same time, oxides are usually unintentionally n-type doped. This lower Fermi level renders the material more insulating by compensating for the presence of donor defects. Both are desirable to improve the performance of Al2O3-based memristors.",

                                "Experimentally, Mg doping in Al2O3 may be achieved by insertion of an MgO atomic layer into Al2O3 atomic layer stacks grown on Al. Since ALD growth can truly occur layer by layer by carefully controlling the M/I interface and ALD conditions, the MgO/Al2O3 atomic layer stacks obtained using in vacuo ALD allow atomic-scale controlled VO doping. FIG. 3A, panels (a)-(d) illustrates a few samples including a stack of: 17 Al2O3 atomic layers (FIG. 3A, panel (a)), 14 Al2O3 atomic layers with 3 MgO atomic layers inserted at 3rd, 6th and 9th layer positions above the Al electrode at the bottom (FIG. 3A, panel (b)), 16 Al2O3 atomic layers with 1 MgO atomic layer inserted at the 1st layer position immediately on the Al electrode (FIG. 3A, panel (c)), and 14 Al2O3 atomic layers with 3 MgO atomic layers inserted at the 1st, 4th and 7th layer positions above the Al electrode (FIG. 3A, panel (d)). It should be noted that all four samples had the same M1/M2 stack thickness of \u02dc1.9 nm (17 total ALD cycles at \u02dc0.11 nm/cycle for MgO and Al2O3 atomic layers) to allow a direct comparison of memristor performance. Without MgO, negligible Vo and other defects were expected in the pristine Al2O3 atomic layer stack (FIG. 3B, panel (a)), which was confirmed in the representative in vacuo scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) dI/dV spectrum shown in FIG. 3C, panel (a), with a large Eb of 1.79 eV and hard dielectric breakdown. In the memristive SET/RESET operation on this device, no sustainable memristive switches were observed except a permanent dielectric breakdown (FIG. 3D, panel (a)), which is consistent with the STS observation and anticipated result for a pristine dielectric. This result also confirms that the M1/M2 layer for memristors differs from tunnel barrier layers (TBLs) of tunnel junctions since the M1/M2 layer requires charge carriers (or VO) while the TBLs require pristine insulators without mobile charge carriers.",
                                "By inserting 3 MgO atomic layers at 3rd, 6th and 9th layer positions above the Al electrode at the bottom (FIG. 3A, panel (b)), VO was introduced in the Al2O3 atomic layers nearby (FIG. 3B, panel (b)). This is illustrated in the in vacuo STS dI/dV spectrum (FIG. 3C, panel (b)) including the rounding of the spectrum's conduction band onset from that of a pristine insulator and slightly reduced Eb to 1.70 eV as compared to the case without doping as shown in panel (a) of FIGS. 3A-3D. This VO doping is important since a few memristive switches were indeed observed (FIG. 3D, panel (b)) despite low endurance and device yield. In the sample shown in panel (c) of FIG. 3A, a single ALD-MgO atomic layer was inserted as the M2 layer on the Al electrode. This localized the VO near the interface with the Al electrode. FIG. 3C, panel (c), shows a slight dip in Eb of the sample down to \u02dc1.38 eV, illustrating the increased carrier doping in the M1/M2 layer. Unlike the two samples with no M2 layer (the samples of panel (a) of FIG. 3A and panel (b) of FIG. 3A make use of an Al2O3 atomic layer to form an interface with the Al electrode), the sample with a single ALD-MgO atomic layer as the M2 layer (panel (c) of FIG. 3A) showed sustainable memristive switching (FIG. 3D, panel (c)). As noted above, the sample of FIG. 3A, panel (c), differs from that of FIG. 3A, panel (a), and FIG. 3A, panel (b), in having a single MgO inserted at the 1st layer position above the Al electrode. The memristive switch enabled by this single MgO atomic layer indicates the importance of VO doping near the M/I interface. The sample of FIG. 3A, panel (d), contained a single MgO atomic layer as the M2 layer and two additional MgO layers in the M1 Al2O3 stack. The combination of the VO doping in both M1 and M2 layers using MgO atomic layer insertion led to a more comprehensive VO doping effect, but similar overall barrier quality as seen in FIG. 3C, panel (d), which shows a representative Eb of \u02dc1.38 eV. The benefit of VO doping in both M1 and M2 is demonstrated by the sustainable switching between HRS and LRS (FIG. 3D, panel (d)) and high device yield \u02dc100%. It should be noted that both samples of FIG. 3A, panels (b) and (d), had 3 MgO layers. The difference in their electronic structures revealed from the in vacuo STS study indicates that the number and location of the inserted MgO atomic layers are both important to atomic tuning of memristor parameters.",

                                "FIGS. 4A and 4B compare two memristors with 3 MgO atomic layers inserted in 1st, 4th and 7th layer positions (similar to that in FIG. 3A, panel (d)), while the total M1/M2 thicknesses are 20 C (2.2 nm) and 14 C (1.5 nm), respectively. Considering the two devices both had 1 C MgO in the M2 layer and 2 MgO layers in M1 at the same positions, the major difference between the two devices is their M1 layer thicknesses through the addition of Al2O3 atomic layers. The two devices exhibited the anticipated hysteretic I-V curves which differed quantitatively in their HRS and hence on/off ratio values due to the M1 layer thicknesses. Indeed, the HRS values for the 20 C and 14 C memristors were 3.98 M\u03a9 and 17.4 k\u03a9, respectively, while the LRS values were comparable. This resulted in an on/off of \u02dc104 for the 20 C memristor and \u02dc20 for the 14 C memristor.",
                                "To further understand the effect of the M1 layer thickness on the memristor parameters, the HRS, LRS, on/off, and SET/RESET voltage values of memristors with a total M1/M2 layer thickness varied in the range of 11-22 C, or equivalently the M1 thickness varied from 10-21 C (all devices have 1 MgO layer as the M2 layer at the Al electrode interface), are illustrated in FIGS. 4E and 4F, respectively. As shown in FIG. 4E, the HRS (middle) and on/off ratio (top) exhibited a monotonic increase with thickness and peak at M1/M2 thickness=20 C. In the semi-log scale, the curves were linear, indicating an exponential dependence on the M1 thickness and the \u201ctunneling\u201d nature of the memristive HRS conduction. This observation is important as it is the first demonstration of a quantitative tunability of the memristor parameters by varying the dielectric thickness. For example, the on/off ratio was tunable in the range of 10-104 as the M1/M2 layer thickness was varied between 11-22 C (1.2-2.4 nm). At larger thicknesses, a drop in HRS and on/off ratio was observed. Meanwhile, LRS remained more or less constant in almost the entire thickness range, likely due to the LRS consisting of series CF and wire resistances, except an upturn for 22 C, suggesting the CF formation may be incomplete. Based on the trends in both HRS and LRS as a function of thickness, but without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, it is thought that CF formation/annihilation may become difficult or incomplete above a critical M1 thickness. This argument is validated considering the tunnel mechanism of memristors revealed in FIG. 4E.",
                                "FIG. 4F displays the average SET and RESET voltages of the memristors shown in FIG. 4E. A fairly constant SET voltage of 1.0-1.5 V and RESET voltage of \u22122.0 to \u22123.5 V were observed on these devices. SET and RESET voltages are typically more dependent on diffusivity and switching pulse programming parameters (compliance current, pulse length, etc.) and mostly independent of material selection in metal oxides. A possible explanation for the slight deviation from the trend with the 11 C thick sample is that it was possible to get SET at a lower voltage due to the much lower HRS (\u02dc103\u03a9) compared to the next point in the set (\u02dc104\u03a9). Together, the results of FIGS. 4A-4F demonstrate that the M1 layer was the primary provider of resistance in the resistive switching mechanism in these devices.",

                                "It should be noted that all devices in FIGS. 4A-4F had a single MgO atomic layer as the M2 in the M1/M2 stack. In order to understand the difference made by this ALD-M2 layer from an M2 layer made with other methods, another set of memristors was fabricated with an ALD-Al2O3 M1 layer on a defective aluminum oxide M2 formed through oxygen diffusion into an Al electrode (Th\u2014AlOx) under controlled oxygen pressure and exposure time at room temperature. The microstructure of the Th\u2014AlOx is schematically shown in FIG. 1A in which a nonuniform distribution of VO in the form of atomic defects and clusters and other defects were anticipated. Such a nonideal defect structure is responsible for tunnel barrier leakage when Th\u2014AlOx thickness is <0.6 nm and low barrier height Eb<<1.0 eV. (Wilt J., Gong Y. et al., Physical Review Applied, 7, 064022 (2017).) The defective Th\u2014AlOx M2 layer has a direct impact on the quality of the ALD-M1 layer grown on top in that it extends the defective structure into the M1 layer, which in turn affects the Eb of the M1 as shown schematically in FIGS. 5A-5B. This was confirmed in the in vacuo STS study of the electronic structures of the ALD-M1 layers on the two different kinds of M2 layers. FIG. 5C shows a representative STS dI/dV spectrum taken on the sample having an M1 layer consisting of 2 MgO layers inserted on the 4th and 7th layer positions in 6 Al2O3 atomic layers on a single ALD-MgO M2 layer (this sample is similar to that of FIG. 3A, panel (d)). An average Eb of 1.45\u00b10.08 eV was observed for this sample. Comparatively, FIG. 5D shows an STS dI/dV spectrum for a sample having an M1 layer consisting of 10 Al2O3 layers grown on a Th\u2014AlOx M2 layer (\u02dc1 nm in thickness), giving an average Eb of 0.75\u00b10.01 eV. The higher Eb value for the device of FIG. 5A denotes a higher quality insulator with a lower defect concentration. The much-reduced Eb value for the ALD-Al2O3 M1 layer of the FIG. 5B sample confirms that the defects in the Th\u2014AlOx M2 layer indeed extended into the M1 layer and degraded the dielectric quality of the M1 layer, which in turn impacted memristor performance.",
                                "FIG. 5E shows the log-scale plot of both HRS and LRS for the samples of FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B. The plot shows an exponential increase in HRS with M1/M2 total thickness for both kinds of memristors, with either 1 ALD-MgO M2 (open) or Th\u2014AlOx M2 (solid) layer. The LRS values remained fairly constant for the 1 ALD-MgO M2 sample (solid red) while some random jumps are visible for the Th\u2014AlOx M2 sample (open red), which were likely due to the randomness and nonuniformity of defects in the Th\u2014AlOx. An example of this can be seen in both Al2O3 (5 C)/Th\u2014AlOx and Al2O3 (8 C)/Th\u2014AlOx memristors which show almost no change in HRS even with the added 3 C of dielectric in the M1 layer. In fact, the monotonic increasing M1/M2 thickness dependence of HRS was observed only at larger thickness above 17 C total thickness for memristors using a Th\u2014AlOx M2 layer. This is in contrast to the case of the memristors with an ALD-MgO M2 layer, for which the total M1/M2 layer thickness can be thinner, while still exhibiting relatively high on/off ratios. For example, the memristor having the ALD-MgO M2 layer and 11 C total M1/M2 thickness and exhibiting an on/off ratio of >10 is believed to be the thinnest ALD-based memristor ever reported.",
                                "In order to quantify the effect of the two kinds of the M2 layers (1 ALD-MgO M2 versus Th\u2014AlOx M2) on memristor parameters, the resistance-area (RA) product was fit as a function of M1/M2 thickness with the following tunneling current equations:",

Note that the\n    fitted E_(T) values in both sets of memristors are higher than the\n    E_(b) values measured from STS dI/dV spectra. This is different for\n    the tunnel barrier layers of tunnel junctions in which the STS\n    measured E_(b) is very close to the E_(T) obtained by fitting the\n    device tunneling resistance vs tunnel barrier thickness curve. This\n    difference can be attributed to the presence of a Schottky barrier\n    (V_(Sch)) in memristors, as compared to tunnel junctions which have\n    two Ohmic contacts. Thus, for memristors, E_(T)=V_(Sch)+E_(b).\n    Subtracting the E_(b) from E_(T) for the corresponding memristors\n    results in V_(Sch) values of 1.19\u00b10.08 eV and 1.19\u00b10.01 eV for the\n    memristors on the 1 ALD-MgO and Th\u2014AlO_(x) M2, respectively. This\n    means that the Schottky barrier adds an additional barrier height of\n    1.19 eV when forming between the Pd electrode and the underlying\n    ALD-Al\u2082O\u2083 atomic layer and works in conjunction with the E_(b) to\n    provide extremely high resistances at small read voltages. The much\n    higher E_(b) values, and hence E_(T) values, for the memristors\n    having the 1 ALD MgO M2 layer indicates that unintended defects\n    (especially those with high nonuniformity and large dimensions\n    potentially causing leakage, low device yield, and endurance) can be\n    minimized by use of a single ALD MgO M2 layer. It is surprising that\n    use of a single atomically thin MgO M2 layer was enough to achieve\n    such high E_(T) values, as well as the high HRS and on/off ratios\n    shown in FIG. **5**E. Furthermore, the comparable electronic\n    structure of the M1 layer grown on top of this ALD MgO M2 layer\n    shows that the V_(O) doping in this M2 layer was at the atomic level\n    and did not lead to defective structures on the M1 layer grown on\n    top.",

                                "FIGS. 6A-6C compare results for eight samples (structures are shown at the bottom of FIG. 6C) including HRS, LRS, on/off ratios (FIG. 6A); initial and stabilized HRS (FIG. 6B); and the device yield (FIG. 6C). Samples 1-7 had the same M1/M2 thickness (17 C or 1.9 nm) but with different numbers and stacking orders of ALD-Al2O3 and ALD-MgO layers grown on an Al electrode. Sample 8 had 8 C of ALD-Al2O3 on a \u02dc1 nm thick Th\u2014AlOx M2 layer (total M1/M2 thickness also \u02dc1.9 nm). The architectures of these eight samples were selected to shed light on the role of VO doping by insertion of MgO atomic layers. Samples 1 and 2 used three MgO layers inserted in M1 but no M2 layer (i.e., an Al2O3 atomic layer forms the interface with the Al electrode); this means there were few VO present at the ohmic M/I interface for these samples. This explains the very low device yields of these two samples (FIG. 6C) and very low endurance (devices failed after the first few memristive switches), signifying that the VO provided in M1 through the insertion of 3 MgO layers was not sufficient to repeatedly form CFs and instead resulted in permanent dielectric breakdown for a large portion of the devices. The failure suggests that the VO provided in M2 is important for sustainable formation of CFs during memristive switches. This was further evidenced by the considerably improved device yield for Sample 3 that contained 1 MgO as the M2 layer but no MgO in M1. Samples 4-7 had MgO inserted in both M1 and M2 with improved device yield up to 100% for Samples 4, 5, and 7. This indicates that it is the combination of the VO doping in both M1 and M2 that enables the sustainable CF formation required for high-performance memristive switches. This also indicates that these intermittent ALD-MgO layers in the M1 layer can assist in the formation of CFs as a relay for transferring charge to ionize stabilized neutral VO. Sample 8 had a similar structure to Sample 3 (with 1 MgO in M2) except with a \u02dc1 nm thick Th\u2014AlOx in M2. The much degraded memristor performance of Sample 8 was evidenced by reduced HRS, on/off ratio, and device yield (\u02dc80%), as compared to Sample 3, as well as compared to Samples 4-7. These results illustrate the critical importance in controlling unwanted defects in the M1/M2 stack so as to eliminate their negative impact on CF formation via atomic VO diffusion.",
                                "In addition, the results show that the location of the inserted MgO layers in the M1 stack can have subtle, but important effects on the memristor performance. For example, Sample 5 had its top-most MgO very close to the Schottky interface. This decreased the HRS and on/off ratio as compared to Sample 4, which exhibited the highest HRS and on/off ratio among the eight samples. This suggests that the Mg-doping in Al2O3 may reduce Vsch due to the Fermi energy reduction and the corresponding shift of the Eb. On the other hand, inserting MgO layers in M1 directly on top of the M2 MgO layer, such as in Sample 6 (1 MgO in M1 on top of the M2 MgO layer) and Sample 7 (2 MgO in M1 on top of the M2 MgO layer), increased HRS and on/off ratio values for these samples as compared to Sample 5. This suggests that the additional MgO layers grown directly on the M2 MgO layer may increase the VO concentration in M1, making M1 less insulating. Interestingly, Samples 6 and 7 showed an R0 value in the 104\u03a9 range, but when forced to reset during the initial memristive switches, the HRS went up to the 105\u03a9 range (FIG. 6B). This is in contrast to the nearly identical R0 and HRS observed in Sample 4. Note that the other samples 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 showed lower stabilized HRS after a few initial memristive switches, possibly due to dielectric breakdown (Sample 1 & 2), inadequate amount of VO in M1 to support sustainable memristive switches (Sample 3), reduction of the Vsch (Sample 5), and presence of other defects originated from the Th\u2014AlOx M2 (Sample 8). Therefore, the increase from lower R0 to higher stabilized HRS indicates that for Samples 6 and 7, there may have been an excess of VO locally formed at the M1/M2 interface due to Mg-doping by the inserted MgO layers. Note that the increased resistance expected from Mg-doping in pristine Al2O3 as predicted from the DFT simulations of FIGS. 2A-2C may only occur partially before the localized VO are driven out of the M1/M2 interface by the electric field. This means that the number and location of MgO atomic layers in M1 allow for dynamically tuning the memristor parameters using an electric field. After the dynamic tuning, Samples 6 & 7 had on/off ratios increased by up to an order of magnitude with a device yield of 92% for Sample 6 and 100% for Sample 7.",
                                "Conclusion",
                                "In conclusion, atomic-scale controlled VO doping of ultrathin pristine Al2O3 has been explored in this work by insertion of MgO atomic layers into Al2O3 atomic layer stacks grown using in vacuo ALD for atomically tunable memristors. Two effects of Mg doping in pristine Al2O3 are revealed by DFT calculations: reduction of the Fermi energy and hence, increase in resistivity, and increased generation of VO. These are both desirable for high performance memristors. These two effects have been experimentally confirmed through a comparative study of memristor performance parameters with respect to the number and location of the inserted MgO atomic layers in the MgO/Al2O3 atomic layer stacks. Excitingly, this allows atomically tunable memristors to be achieved. Even using a M1/M2 thickness of just 1.2-2.4 nm, it was shown that the HRS can be tuned continuously over three orders of magnitude, leading to an on/off ratio tunable in the range of 10-104 over this thickness range. Furthermore, dynamically tunable on/off ratio by up to one order of magnitude was obtained by arranging the MgO atomic layers at the M1/M2 interface. Finally, an exponentially decreasing tunneling conductance with increasing M1/M2 thickness demonstrates that tunneling is the dominant HRS conduction mechanism of these memristors. The tunnel barrier height ET=Eb+Vsch is determined by the M1/M2 barrier height Eb and the Schottky barrier Vsch, meaning that the Schottky and tunnel barriers work in tandem to limit current. In vacuo STS dI/dV characterization has revealed that higher Eb up to 1.45 eV can be obtained in less defective Al2O3/MgO M1/M2 grown on Al electrode with a negligible M/I interface, in contrast to much lower Eb 0.75 eV when a defective native oxide IL is present. Nevertheless, the Vsch of 1.19 eV can be maintained at the Pd/Al2O3 Schottky interface. The results demonstrate a new approach for design and fabrication of ultrathin memristors tunable at an atomic scale.",
