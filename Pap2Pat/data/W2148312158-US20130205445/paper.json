    "title": "Increased Activity of the Vacuolar Monosaccharide Transporter TMT1 Alters Cellular Sugar Partitioning, Sugar Signaling, and Seed Yield in Arabidopsis ",
    "date": "2010-08-13",
    "abstract": "The extent to which vacuolar sugar transport activity affects molecular, cellular, and developmental processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is unknown. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that overexpression of the tonoplast monosaccharide transporter TMT1 in a tmt1-2::tDNA mutant led to increased proton-coupled monosaccharide import into isolated mesophyll vacuoles in comparison with wild-type vacuoles. TMT1 overexpressor mutants grew faster than wild-type plants on soil and in high-glucose (Glc)-containing liquid medium. These effects were correlated with increased vacuolar monosaccharide compartmentation, as revealed by nonaqueous fractionation and by chlorophyllab-binding protein1 and nitrate reductase1 gene expression studies. Soil-grown TMT1 overexpressor plants respired less Glc than wild-type plants and only about half the amount of Glc respired by tmt1-2::tDNA mutants. In sum, these data show that TMT activity in wild-type plants limits vacuolar monosaccharide loading. Remarkably, TMT1 overexpressor mutants produced larger seeds and greater total seed yield, which was associated with increased lipid and protein content. These changes in seed properties were correlated with slightly decreased nocturnal CO2 release and increased sugar export rates from detached source leaves. The SUC2 gene, which codes for a sucrose transporter that may be critical for phloem loading in leaves, has been identified as Glc repressed. Thus, the observation that SUC2 mRNA increased slightly in TMT1 overexpressor leaves, characterized by lowered cytosolic Glc levels than wild-type leaves, provided further evidence of a stimulated source capacity. In summary, increased TMT activity in Arabidopsis induced modified subcellular sugar compartmentation, altered cellular sugar sensing, affected assimilate allocation, increased the biomass of Arabidopsis seeds, and accelerated early plant development.",

                        "To gain increased monosaccharide import into Arabidopsis vacuoles, the TMT1 gene was expressed under the control of a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. To prevent possible cosuppression, we transformed the homozygous Arabidopsis mutant tmt1-2::tDNA lacking isoforms TMT1 and TMT2. Sugar levels and physiological properties of this double mutant are nearly identical to the triple mutant tmt1-2-3::tDNA lacking all TMT isoforms (Wormit et al., 2006). The TMT1-overexpressing lines 1, 4, and 10 were selected from 25 independent 35S: tmt1;1-2 mutants on the basis of high TMT1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A).",
                        "When grown at standard temperature (21\u00b0C), TMT1 mRNA was not detectable in the tmt1-2:: tDNA mutant or in wild-type plants (Fig. 1A). The absence of detectable TMT1 mRNA in wild-type plants and the tmt1-2::tDNA line is consistent with both the homozygous situation in the knockout mutant and the low TMT1 expression level in leaves of Arabidopsis plants grown at standard temperature (Wormit et al., 2006). However, the TMT1 gene is cold induced (Wormit et al., 2006), and upon transfer of the plants into the cold (4\u00b0C), we were able to detect TMT1 mRNA in wild-type leaves but not in the tmt1-2::tDNA mutant (Fig. 1B). In comparison with wildtype plants, it was evident that even under cold conditions the 35S:tmt1;1-2 mutant lines 1, 4, and 10 exhibited severalfold increases in TMT1 mRNA (Fig. 1B). "

                        "Previously, we showed that all TMT proteins reside in the vacuolar membrane and that they are very likely involved in Glc accumulation in vacuoles (Wormit et al., 2006). Accordingly, one would expect that this TMT-mediated importing of Glc into vacuoles is energized by the pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane. Electrogenic-type sugar transport across the membrane of Arabidopsis mesophyll vacuoles has recently been identified and characterized with the patch-clamp technique (Schneider et al., 2008). Therefore, to provide evidence for the function of TMT proteins as vacuolar Glc-uptake carrier systems, whole-vacuole patch-clamp measurements were conducted to resolve small current amplitudes expected for transporters with low transport capacity.",
                        "Since the transport capacity of H + -dependent carrier systems is likely to depend on both the substrate and the H + gradient across the membrane, the first set of experiments was performed in the presence of a physiological pH gradient from pH 5.5 in the vacuolar lumen to pH 7.5 in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, top panel). When the Glc gradient was raised 50-fold upon increasing the Glc concentration in the cytosolic medium from 0 to 50 mM (Fig. 2A, top panel), there was a simultaneous rise in negative current (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B). This points to Glc/substrate-driven H + currents directed from the vacuole into the cytosol. Under identical experimental conditions, TMT1-overexpressing vacuoles from 35S:tmt1;1-2 mutant line 4 exhibiting the highest corresponding mRNA accumulation showed a 2-fold higher response to Glc application than wild-type vacuoles (Fig. 2,A, bottom panel, and B). In contrast, only minor Glc-induced currents were recorded from vacuoles of the double mutant tmt1-2::tDNA (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B).",
                        "These results suggest that TMT1 functions as an electrogenic transporter that mediates Glc import into the vacuole and H + export out of the vacuole. To further explore the pH dependence of this transport system, additional experiments with TMT1-overexpressing vacuoles were performed under symmetrical pH conditions. With a pH of 7.5 on both sides of the membrane, Glc-induced H + currents were about 50% lower in comparison with the pH gradient (Fig. 2C). These observations indicate that (1) TMT1-mediated Glc uptake into the vacuole is strongly promoted by a pH gradient in the opposite direction to the Glc gradient, and (2) a sole Glc gradient can drive TMT1mediated H + flux from the vacuole into the cytosol."

The double knockout mutant tmt1-2::tDNA developed only slightly in the presence of Glc, attaining no more than 9 mg fresh weight within 12 d (Fig. 3B).

Thus, it was of interest to analyze sugar metabolism in these genotypes in more detail.",

Interestingly, although all TMT1 overexpressor lines grew much better than the wild-type plants under conditions of high Glc (Fig. 3B), the fresh weight levels of Glc, Fru, and Suc in all four plant genotypes were almost equal (Fig. 4A). Glc levels were between 21 and 23 mmol g 21 fresh weight, Fru levels were much lower, approaching between 2 and 3 mmol g 21 fresh weight, and Suc had the highest concentrations, ranging between 27 and 31 mmol g 21 fresh weight (Fig. 4A).

TMT1 overexpressor lines 1 and 4 accumulated Fru nearly exclusively in the vacuole, which held up to 90% (line 1), whereas less than 10% occurred in plastids (Fig. 4B).

                "Given the importance of sugar allocation and storage to plant metabolism, plant development, and for animal and human diets, it may be challenging to modify sugar storage capacities by molecular genetic approaches. Although it has been demonstrated that sugar deposition in vacuoles in the form of fructans greatly enhances leaf storage capacity (Pollock, 1986), the extent to which sugar transport across the vacuolar membrane limits plant performance has not been determined. To address this issue, we created TMT1overexpressing Arabidopsis mutants (Fig. 1) and analyzed their properties in detail.",
                "Overexpression of the TMT1 gene is correlated with expected altered vacuolar monosaccharide transport activities. This conclusion is based on indirect and direct experimental evidence. First, all TMT1 overexpressor lines exhibit decreased rates of 14 CO 2 release after import of radioactively labeled Glc in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 6A). In contrast to the three TMT1 overexpressor lines, the double knockout mutant tmt1-2::tDNA exhibits increased rates of 14 CO 2 release (Fig. 6A). Second, TMT1 overexpressor lines exhibit increased relative vacuolar monosaccharide levels in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the double knockout mutant tmt1-2::tDNA exhibits increased cytosolic monosaccharide levels in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 4B). Third, patch-clamp experiments confirm stimulated Glc transport rates across the vacuolar membrane from TMT1 overexpressor line 4 but decreased vacuolar Glc transport across vacuoles isolated from the TMT double mutant tmt1-2::tDNA (Fig. 2B).",
                "Both the occurrence of Glc-dependent electrical currents across the membrane from patched vacuoles prepared from TMT1-overexpressing plants (Fig. 2B) and the strong effect of a pH gradient across the tonoplast on Glc-elicited currents (Fig. 2C) clearly indicate that TMT1-mediated transport is coupled to a proton antiport. Moreover, the observation that vacuoles from tmt1-2::tDNA mutants showed only about 20% of the current observed in wild-type vacuoles (Fig. 2B) indicates that TMT1 and TMT2 contribute substantially to the pH-dependent monosaccharide import observed on isolated plant vacuoles in other species (Thom and Komor, 1984;Martinoia et al., 1987). In addition, this conclusion is fully in line with the impaired ability of this double mutant to accumulate monosaccharides in response to cold temperature (Wormit et al., 2006). After transfer of wildtype Arabidopsis into the cold, leaf Glc and Fru levels rise about 10-fold (Wanner and Junttila, 1999;Zuther et al., 2004), whereas in the tmt1-2::tDNA mutant, levels of these monosaccharides increase only slightly at such temperatures (Wormit et al., 2006).",
                "The observation that cultivation of Arabidopsis in Glc-containing liquid culture medium inhibits plant growth (Fig. 3B) exemplifies a known effect of high sugar levels on plant development (Smeekens, 1998). Since all three 35S:tmt1;1-2 mutants do not show such strong growth repression as in wild-type plants (Fig. 3B), and because the mutants contain similar total sugar levels as wild-type plants (Fig. 4A), we conclude that the absolute cellular sugar levels are of minor importance in sugar repression of plant development. However, it is assumed that a hexokinase located in the cytosol is involved in plant sugar sensing (Xiao et al., 2000). Thus, the observation that TMT1 overexpressor mutants, showing altered sugar signalling (Figs. 4A and6B), do not accumulate cytosolic mono-  saccharides (Fig. 4B) clarifies that cytosolic Glc concentration is of superior importance in sugar regulation of gene expression. Obviously, as a consequence of the proton-energized Glc transport (Fig. 2C), TMT1 overexpressor lines are able to build and maintain steeper monosaccharide gradients between the vacuolar lumen and the surrounding cytosol than wildtype plants (Fig. 4B).",
                "From our data, we conclude that the activity of the tonoplast-located monosaccharide transporter TMT limits vacuolar monosaccharide accumulation in wild-type Arabidopsis plants. This conclusion appears justified for the following reasons: (1) when grown on soil, the sugar-repressed CAB1 gene is expressed less in tmt1-2::tDNA plants but is expressed greater in all three 35S:tmt1;1-2 lines in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 6B); and (2) the sugar-induced NR1 gene is expressed greater in tmt1-2::tDNA plants and expressed less in all three 35S:tmt1;1-2 lines in comparison with wild-type plants (Fig. 6B). In fact, observed changes in CAB1 and NR1 expression can be taken as a confirmation for altered intracellular carbohydrate partitioning, as identified by the nonaqueous fractionation of cell compartments (Fig. 4B).",
                "Having identified Arabidopsis mutants with altered subcellular sugar partitioning and altered sensing of sugars, under both induced conditions (Figs. 4B and5) and on soil (Fig. 6B), the challenge of analyzing the plants in greater detail remains. The decelerated development of tmt1-2::tDNA plants and the accelerated development of all three 35S:tmt1;1-2 lines on soil (Fig. 7) represent markedly contrasting effects in both types of genetic modifications. These differences might be caused, in part, by different storage reserves available in the mobilizing respective seeds, especially in case of TMT1 overexpressor seeds (Fig. 8, A-C).",
                "However, accelerated development of the TMT1 overexpressor lines might also result from improved daily net carbon usage in these mutants. Reduced carbon loss is indicated by decreased rates of Glc respiration in the three TMT1 overexpressor lines (Fig. 6A) and decreased nocturnal respiration in the two TMT1 overexpressor lines 4 and 10 (Fig. 9B), having the largest seeds (Fig. 8A). It is worth noting that potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber cells with elevated cytosolic levels of hexoses exhibit stimulated respiratory carbon loss (Trethewey et al., 1999). Thus, physiological changes displayed by TMT1 overexpressor lines 4 and 10 (i.e. less respiration of Glc; Fig. 6A) and reduced nocturnal CO 2 release (Fig. 9B) generally provide more cellular carbon for anabolic reactions, thereby elevating seed production.",
                "Phloem exudates were examined to determine why TMT1 overexpressor lines exhibit increased 1,000 seed weight and increased total seed biomass per plant (Fig. 8, A andD). Exudate analysis confirmed that the three TMT1 overexpressor lines exhibit increased capacity to export sugars from source to sink tissue, whereas, as expected, the tmt1-2::tDNA double knockout plants exhibit slightly reduced phloem export rates (Fig. 10C), correlated with reduced seed yields (Fig. 8, A andB). Accordingly, we assume that after the onset of seed development in TMT1 overexpressors, the novel sink gains more carbon than corresponding tissue in wild-type plants. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that stimulated sugar loading in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum) grains leads to increased seed biomass (Weichert et al., 2010). The latter observation is an example of a yield gain caused by increasing sink strength (Weichert et al., 2010), whereas the TMT1 overexpressor lines demonstrate that elevated source strength can also stimulate seed production. It has not escaped our attention that stimulated seed weight is not only caused by altered lipid contents but also by increased seed protein levels (Fig. 8, A-C). At this point, we cannot fully explain this observation, but it seems conceivable that stimulated leaf sugar export in TMT1 overexpressors (Fig. 10C) might also hold true for other photosynthates, like de novo synthesized amino acids. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that increased Suc uptake in developing wheat grains also stimulates total storage protein synthesis (Weichert et al., 2010).",
                "Stimulated sugar export capacity of the three TMT1 overexpressor lines (Fig. 10C) is associated with increased expression of the phloem-localized Suc transporter SUC2 (Fig. 10B). Phloem-specific expression and onset of SUC2 expression during induction of the source capacity of Arabidopsis leaves (Truernit and Sauer, 1995;Imlau et al., 1999) led to speculation that this carrier is critical for phloem loading in Arabidopsis (Williams et al., 2000). The observation that SUC2 expression is inhibited upon Glc application (Fig. 10A) concurs with data on whole genome arrays (Zimmermann et al., 2004). It is reasonable to assume that cytosolic Glc concentrations in SUC2-expressing phloem cells are altered similarly in mesophyll cells (Figs. 4B and6B). If so, changes in intracellular monosaccharide compartmentation might contribute to stimulated phloem loading in TMT1 overexpressor leaves, which has been confirmed experimentally (Fig. 10C).",
                "In this study, we tried to provide a quite comprehensive analysis of TMT1-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. Accordingly, metabolic and physiological changes in different tissues and on plants grown under various growth conditions have been analyzed. Such a wide experimental approach was mandatory as altered sugar-sensing properties were demonstrated on liquid culture-grown Arabidopsis, allowing very controlled conditions. Alternatively, for studying of growth rates, young plants were required (Fig. 7), whereas for analysis of sugar export rates, mature leaves have been analyzed (Fig. 10). In summary of our results, we propose that the synthesis of storage products in Arabidopsis seeds might be limited by intracellular sugar allocation in source leaves. In addition, in wild-type plants, sugar signaling takes place under standard growth conditions. Increased activity of the TMT1 protein (under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter) causes increased source activity, as indicated by increased expression of photosynthesis-related genes (Fig. 6C), reduced consumption of sugars for respiration (Fig. 6A), reduced nocturnal loss of CO 2 (Fig. 9B), and increased sugar export capacity from source leaves (Fig. 10C). It will be interesting and informative to transfer this approach to crop plants in the near future. Moreover, the use of organspecific promoters driving TMT1 expression will further allow us to clarify the processes observed in more detail."

Thereby, the vacuolar membrane was clamped to 0 mV. Patch pipettes prepared from Kimax-51 glass capillaries (Kimble Products) were characterized by a resistance in the range of 1.5 to 3 MV. Macroscopic currents were recorded at a sample acquisition rate of 2 ms with an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronic) and low-pass filtered at 30 Hz. Data were digitized by an ITC-16 computer interface (Instrutech), stored on a Fujitsu Siemens computer, and analyzed offline using the software programs Pulse (HEKA Electronik) and IGORPro (Wave Metrics). Current amplitudes of individual vacuoles were normalized to the whole-vacuole membrane capacitance C m to allow comparison of macroscopic current magnitudes among different vacuoles. Both bath and pipette media contained 200 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 2 mM MgCl 2 . pH values were either adjusted with 10 mM HEPES-Tris to pH 7.5 or with 10 mM MES-Tris to pH 5.5.
