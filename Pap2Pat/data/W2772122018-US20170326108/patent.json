                        "Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal infectious neurodegenerative disorders in man and animals (Prusiner 1982, 1998). Examples are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (vCJD), variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr), Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and kuru in humans; bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goat, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Prions use template-directed refolding of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) into the pathologic isoform PrPSc for propagation (Prusiner 1982, 1998). This epigenetic process does not involve the coding of nucleic acids in the infectious agent and is solely based on change in protein conformation.",
                        "In humans, prion disease can be initiated by a spontaneous event, with genetic linkage passing from generation to generation within families, or acquired by infection. Examples of routes for infectious prion transmission include blood transfusions, dura mater grafts, and contaminated human growth hormone or contaminated medical instruments (iatrogenic prion diseases). Although rare, every year about 8,000 people die of sporadic and genetic prion diseases worldwide, and patients with genetic predisposition to prion infection can be diagnosed long before the onset of clinical disease presentation. As a result of BSE, there is evidence that between 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 in the general population of U.K. are infected with vCJD prions and are incubating the disease. So far, there is no established therapy or prophylaxis for human prion diseases. The major limitations of experimental anti-prion drugs include severe side effects observed in animal models and inability of the investigational drug to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB).",
                        "Cell culture models persistently infected with prions are typically used to screen potential anti-prion compounds for activity (Nunziante et al., 2003; Gilch et al., 2008; Krammer et al., 2009). In these models, treated and control cells are analyzed for the amount of PrPSc, which serves as a surrogate marker for prion infectivity. In this physiological system, the cellular and molecular requirements for conversion and cellular turnover of prions are considered, whereas most in vitro assays only test for interference in the physical interaction of PrPc and PrPSc (Nunziante et al., 2003; Gilch et al., 2008; Krammer et al., 2009). These requirements include, for example, the proper subcellular localization and trafficking of PrPc and PrPSc as well as the degradation kinetics of PrPSc. Validation of potential drug targets can be performed in prion-infected animal models.",
                        "A promising experimental anti-prion strategy is the induction of autophagy. Autophagy is a basic cellular program for degradation and recycling of cytosolic proteins, protein aggregates, and organelles. Published data shows that autophagy is a potent modifier of the cellular clearance of prions and that drug induced autophagy shifts the delicate equilibrium between propagation and clearance of prions towards the latter (Ertmer et al., 2004, 2007; Aguib et al., 2009; Heiseke et al., 2009, 2010). There is proof-of-concept evidence that drug-induced activation of autophagy can delay or diminish prion diseases in animal models (Aguib et al., 2009; Heiseke et al., 2009).",
                        "AR-12 (a.k.a. OSU-03012) has been previously shown to exhibit anti-tumor, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity. It is thought that AR-12 induces autophagy of cells harboring intracellular microbes. However, the anti-prion activity of AR-12 has not been previously shown."

N2a cells deficient for Atg5 were prepared by CRISPR-Cas9 technology and characterized in immunoblot and DNA sequencing for successful Atg5 knock-out. Characterized single cell clones were then infected with 22L prions as described previously (Maas et al. 2007). Wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) have been described before (Kuma et al., 2004) and have been persistently infected with mouse-adapted prion strains 22L, RML and Me7. CAD5 (a central nervous system catecholaminergic cell line; Qi et al, 1997) and persistently prion-infected 22L-ScCAD cells were prepared as above. MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), N2a cells in Opti-MEM Glutamax medium, both media containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. CAD5 cells were cultured in OptiMEM Glutamax medium containing 10% bovine growth serum (BGS) and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.",

Confluent cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM EDTA; 0.5% Triton X-100; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC)) for 10 min. For proteinase K (PK) treatment, post-nuclear lysates were divided into two halves. One half was incubated with PK (20 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. and digestion was stopped by addition of proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mM Pefabloc) and directly precipitated with methanol. The sample without PK treatment was directly supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and precipitated with methanol. After centrifugation for 25 min at 3,500 rpm (4\u00b0 C.), the pellets were re-dissolved in THE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and gel loading buffer (7% SDS, 30% glycerine, 20% Et-SH, 0.01% Bromphenol blue in 90 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8) was added. After boiling for 5 min an aliquot was analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham). Membranes were blocked with non-fat dry milk (5%) in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) (0.05% Tween 20, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.8), incubated overnight with the appropriate antibody at 4\u00b0 C. and stained using enhanced chemiluminiscence blotting (ECL plus) kit from Amersham. To achieve equal loading of total protein for different samples in immunoblot analysis (e.g. comparison of PrPSc amounts in different samples, or LC3-II levels), the same number of cells were plated and grown under identical conditions over specific periods. Cells were subsequently lysed in the same amount of lysis buffer. Precipitated proteins of each sample were resuspended in the same amount of THE buffer and supplemented with identical amounts of gel loading buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were then analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. In addition, immunoblots were stripped with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody to verify equal amounts of total protein loaded on gel for each sample. To allow comparison of endogenous LC3-II levels, intensity of LC3-II signals were measured relative to actin signals by densitometry analysis.",

                        "The viability of a cell population upon treatment with different compounds was determined with the XTT assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Viability testing was mainly performed in uninfected cells. Data from our and other groups showed that viability in uninfected and persistently prion-infected N2a, CAD5 or MEF cells is substantially the same. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5\u00d7104 cells per well in 96 well plates. The following day, cells were treated for 72 h with various concentrations of the indicated compounds. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl of the XTT reagent was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h, the absorption at 450 nm was measured with a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). The average absorption of four control wells was set as 100% viability. The viability of treated cells was compared to the viability of DMSO (negative control) or Triton X-100 (positive control) treated cells.",

                        "Preparation of recombinant prion proteins was performed as described (Orru et al., 2012). Briefly, mouse PrP (aa 23-231) was cloned into pET-41 plasmids, transformed into E. coli Rosetta, and bacteria cultured in LB media supplemented with kanamycin (0.05 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml). The Overnight Express Autoinduction System (Novagen, USA) was used to induce protein expression. Inclusion bodies were isolated from pelleted cells using Bug Buster Master Mix (Novagen, USA) and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. For purification of recombinant PrP, inclusion bodies were solubilized in (8 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM Na-phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and incubated on the rocker for 1 h at RT. Ni-NTA Superflow resin beads (Quiagen, USA) were incubated in denaturing buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0) for 1 h at RT. Solubilized inclusion bodies were centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 5 min, the supernatant added to the beads and incubated for 1 h with gentle rocking. Beads were then packed into a XK16 glass column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; USA; length 200 mm). Using an Amersham AKTA Explorer FPLC unit running with Unicorn software (5 version, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA), protein was refolded by a gradient from 100% denaturing buffer to 100% refolding buffer (100 mM Na-phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) over 4 h. The column was washed for 30 min with refolding buffer and proteins eluted using a linear gradient from 100% refolding buffer to 100% elution buffer (500 mM imidazole, 100 mM Na-phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5.8). The central portions of the A280 UV peak were collected into dialysis buffer (10 mM Na-phosphate, pH 5.8). Purified protein was filtered using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, transferred into a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (MW 10 kDa; Thermo-Scientific, UA) placed into a 4 l beaker with dialysis buffer overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with continuous stirring. Following dialysis, the protein solution was filtered again with a prewashed 0.22 \u03bcm Argos syringe filter. Protein concentration was measured using BCA protein assay (Thermo-Scientific, 23227), the solution aliquoted and kept in \u221280\u00b0 C. until use.",
                        "B. RT-QuIC assay. Real-time QuIC was performed as described (John et al., 2013). Briefly, reactions were set up in assay buffer containing 20 mM Na-phosphate, pH7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 \u03bcM Thioflavin T and 0.1 mg/ml rPrP substrate. Ninety-eight \u03bcl aliquots were added to the wells of a black-walled 96-well optical bottom plate (Nalge Nunc International, Nunc, USA). Tenfold serial dilutions of brain homogenate or cell homogenate were prepared in 0.5 ml microtubes. Quadruplicate reactions were seeded with 2 \u03bcl of test solution for a final reaction volume of 100 \u03bcl. Reactions contained a final concentration of 0.002% SDS. Plates were sealed with Nunc Amplification Tape (Nalge Nunc International) and incubated in a FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Cary, N.C., USA) plate reader for 30 h. Reactions were incubated at 42\u00b0 C., with cycles of 60 s shaking (700 revolutions per minute) and 60 s of rest throughout the incubation. ThT fluorescence measurements (450 nm excitation and 480 nm emission) were taken every 15 min. RT-QuIC data were averaged from four replicate wells and average values plotted against reaction time. Samples were scored positive if at least 50% of replicates reached a ThT fluorescence cut-off, which was calculated based on the average ThT fluorescence plus 5\u00d7 standard deviation.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 2A, persistently prion (prion strain 22L) infected mouse neuronal cells (ScN2a cell line) were treated for 72 hours with the indicated concentrations of AR-12, and the cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Solvent only-treated cells (DMSO) were used as control. Cell lysates were split into two halves and one treated with proteinase K (PK; 20 \u03bcl/ml, 30 min at 37\u00b0 C.) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.",
                        "The immunoblot was developed with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4H11 and the blot was re-probed with mAbs for actin (gel loading) and LC3 (autophagy marker). PrPSc (right side, +PK; 3 glycoforms indicated by arrows) was dose-dependently reduced, to undetectable levels when treated for 3 days with a concentration of 3 \u03bcM (=100% reduction). Since PrPSc has a very long half-life time in cultured cells (>24 h; see Ertmer et al., 2004), such a strong anti-prion effect after 3 days of treatment strongly indicates that AR-12 induces PrPSc clearance as opposed to inhibiting PrPSc propagation. LC3-II was induced about 2-fold, indicating induction of autophagy.",
                        "FIG. 2B shows an exemplary quantification of the autophagy induction at the indicated concentration of AR-12. FIG. 2C shows that exposing AR-12 to the cells was done at non-toxic concentrations (XTT toxicity assay).",

The CAD5 neuronal cells persistently infected with prions (mouse-adapted scrapie strain 22L; termed ScCAD5) were treated for 72 hours with 1-5 \u03bcM AR-12, and cells subjected to immunoblot analysis. Solvent only-treated cells (DMSO) were used as control. Cell lysates were split into two halves, and one treated with proteinase K (PK; 20 \u03bcl/ml, 30 min at 37\u00b0 C.) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The immunoblot was developed with anti-PrP mAb 4H11, and the blot was re-probed with mAb for actin (gel loading; upper panel). PrPSc levels (+PK; 3 glycoforms indicated by arrows) were reduced, although slightly less than in ScN2a cells. This result was expected, as ScCAD5 cells harbor more PrPSc and therefore would need a longer treatment period. This data show that AR-12 is effective in another neuronal mouse cell type (derived from the central nervous system), confirming results described above for ScN2a cells.",

N2a, MEF and CAD5 cells were treated with either AR-12 (3 \u03bcM) or AR-14 (2 respectively, for 2, 4 or 6 hours. Bafilomycin A1 treatment was used to alter the lysosomal function and to block the autophagic flux. This control demonstrates that AR-12 and AR-14 induce autophagy and do not block autophagic flux. Solvent only-treated cells (DMSO) were used as treatment vehicle control. Cells were lysed, subjected to immunoblot analysis, and the immunoblots were developed with an anti-LC3 mAb as autophagy marker and an actin mAb (gel loading control; upper panel). Both AR-12 and AR-14 showed a time dependent and pronounced increase in LC3-II levels (lower band). This induction was lower than that of BA1-treated cells, which had the highest expression level of LC3-II due to blocking of autophagic flux and lysosomal function. These data indicate that AR-12 and AR-14 are strong inducers of autophagy in all three tested cell lines. Interestingly, the lowest induction was found in CAD5 cells, which correlates with the weakest effects on PrPSc levels in these cells. Formal testing of the impact of autophagy was done using cells compromised in autophagy and comparing them to wild-type cells (see FIGS. 8A and 8C).",
