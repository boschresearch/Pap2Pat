    "abstract": "Background Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) are crucial enzymes in DNA synthesis. In alveolata both enzymes are expressed as one bifunctional enzyme. Results Loss of this essential enzyme activities after successful allelic assortment of knock out alleles yields an auxotrophic marker in ciliates. Here the cloning, characterisation and functional analysis of Tetrahymena thermophila's DHFR-TS is presented. A first aspect of the presented work relates to destruction of DHFR-TS enzyme function in an alveolate thereby causing an auxotrophy for thymidine. A second aspect is to knock in an expression cassette encoding for a foreign gene with subsequent expression of the target protein. Conclusion This system avoids the use of antibiotics or other drugs and therefore is of high interest for biotechnological applications.",

                "Tetrahymena thermophila is a ciliated eukaryotic unicellular organism belonging to the regnum of protozoa and bearing two nuclei, a transcriptionally silent, diploid germline micronucleus (MIC) and a transcriptionally active, polyploid somatic macronucleus (MAC)[1]. In 1923, when Nobel Laureate Andre Lwoff succeeded in growing Tetrahymena in pure culture, the basis for exploiting this alveolate as a model organism was laid. Milestone discoveries made in T. thermophila are the discovery of dynein motors[2], telomeres[3], RNA-mediated catalysis[4], telomerase[5] and the function of histone acetyltransferases in transcription regulation[6]. Within the last decades molecular biological techniques have been developed to alter T. thermophila's genome and proteome: DNA transfection methods range from microinjection[7] and electroporation[8] into the MAC to biolistic bombardment of MIC and MAC[9]. Episomal plasmids based on an rDNA-replicon are available[10], as well as knock out/-in techniques based on homologous recombination[11,12].",
                "On protein level heterologous expression of related species has been performed[13,14] and also endogenous proteins were silenced by a novel antisense-ribosome-technique[15]. The biotechnological potential of T. thermophila has been proven in numerous publications, demonstrating fast growth, high biomass, fermentation in ordinary bacterial/yeast equipment, up-scalability, existence of cheap and chemical defined media [16-18].",
                "Although known and analysed for decades, only a few markers have been described for T. thermophila. So far there are ribosomal point mutation mediated resistances, a plasmid based neomycin resistance[19] and a beta-tubulin selection marker making use of an inducible promoter in combination with mutated tubulins being resistant or sensitive to the mitotic drug taxol[20]. Yet no true auxotrophic marker is available that permits selection without the use of antibiotics or drugs.",
                "Critical enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS). DHFR catalyses the production of tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate; TS is in charge of transferring a methyl-group from N5, N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate to dUMP thereby generating dTMP and tetrahydrofolate. These enzymes being crucial for pyrimidine synthesis have been used as auxotrophic markers in various systems by targeted gene disruption but also a number of inhibitors (antifolates) have been developed as anti-cancer drugs[21]. In animals, fungi and eubacteria the DHFR and TS gene are separately translated, whereas plants, alveolata and euglenozoa have a bifunctional fusion gene with both enzyme activities combined in one protein (\"DHFR-TS\").",
                "The occurrence of the bifunctional enzyme in T. pyriformis has been postulated in 1984 and 1985 but no functional or even molecular biological analysis had been performed. A partial amino acid sequence of DHFR-TS of a non determined \"T. pyriformis-like strain\" has been published in 2002[22], but this work is lacking any proof of linkage to the described partial cDNA to enzyme function. Here we present a first characterization of the T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene including gene structure and functional data on the enzyme and data on in vivo function. For the first time we show that the T. thermophila DHFR-TS locus provides an auxotrophic marker system that enables monitoring of allelic assortment processes. As PCR based approaches always have to cope with wildtype alleles present in the MIC, the DHFR-TS auxotrophy system is able to deliver direct proof of the allelic assortment to be completed: Only in the case of all wildtype alleles in the MAC having been substituted by the knock out construct the auxotrophy will occur. Combining this methodology with a knock in, a new, stable and useful strain to express recombinant enzymes or proteins has been generated."

                "Tetrahymenathermophila is a free-living ciliated protozoan that has become increasingly interesting as an excellent expression system. It is one of the best characterised unicellular eukaryotes and its genome has been sequenced in its entirety (The Institute for Genomic Research[23]). These features form the basis for using T. thermophila in future biotechnology applications. However, appropriate marker systems that are essential tools for genetic manipulations are limited. The enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate reductase (TS) play a crucial for pyrimidine synthesis, therefore both enzymes have been used as auxotrophic marker-systems in various species by targeted gene disruption. The aim was to establish such a DHFR marker system for T. thermophila. Interestingly, the bifunctional DHFR-TS has been as taxonomic tool to set up phylogenetic trees for years. These approaches led to a very rudimental DHFR-TS amino acid fragment sequence of a non determined \"T. pyriformis-like strain\". By using this incomplete information and data from the entire T. thermophila genome it was possible to determine the whole sequence of the bifunctional DHFR-TS MAC gene in T. thermophila. The T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene and its flanking regions were amplified by using the primer pairs DHFR 5'1F NotI, DHFR 5'2R BamHI for the 5'region non coding region, the primer pair DHFR 3'1F XhoI: 5, DHFR 3'1R Acc65I for the 3'region and the primers DHFR CDS-F, DHFR CDS-F for amplification of the coding region."

This is also the case if the ciliate DHFR-TS is compared to the analogous enzyme of Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi (Lm, Tc in figure 2). This is almost due to the highly conserved thymidylate synthase part of the bifunctional enzymes. A highly conserved histidine is found at position 198, suggesting that the amino acids 198\u2013485 represent the thymidylate synthase part of the bifunctional enzyme. Much more heterogeneity is found in the N-terminal part of the bifunctional enzyme that consists of the DHFR part and a linker site. The alignment reveals that almost all enzymes bear one or more individual, non-homologue amino acid stretches (figure 2)."

By inserting the flanking regions of the DHFR-TS gene into a pBS II SK backbone we created a plasmid for stable integration into the ciliate genome. The neo2 cassette of pH4T2[19] was used to monitor the successful uptake of this plasmid by selection against paromomycin. Figure 3 shows that the neo2 cassette is flanked by the ~1.5 kb fragments of the 5' and 3' parts of the non-coding regions of the DHFR-TS gene, respectively. Because the pBS backbone lacks an appropriate origin of replication, paromomycin resistant T. thermophila clones argue for proper homologous recombination in the DHFR-TS gene locus.",
                        "The most convincing evidence for the correct integration into the DHFR-TS locus is a loss of the DHFR-TS activity in the transformed strain. However, in the case of T. thermophila this requires the complete replacement of all chromosomal DHFR-TS wildtype alleles (~45 ARPs) by the ARPs that includes the knock out cassette. We achieved this by allelic assortment, a phenomenon summarised in figure 4. This allelic or phenotypic assortment is based on randomised distribution of the MAC chromosomes units (ARPs) during mitosis. In order to force the assortment process into the desired direction \u2013 namely into the recombinant resistance gene \u2013 the transformed cells were cultivated for at least 3\u20134 weeks using increasing concentrations of the drug paromomycin. Single clones were isolated and tested for DHFR-TS deficiency by using a minimal chemical defined medium (CDM) with (+T) and without thymidine (-T). It could be shown that DHFR-TS knock out clones are real auxotrophic strains. The mutants are able to grow in CDM with thymidine like wildtype strains or strains with an incomplete allelic assortment. In CDM lacking thymidine they are unable to grow (figure 5)."

Therefore we named our constructs pKOI (pKOI: knock out and knock in). To illustrate this knock out/-in concept we constructed the pKOI DVL plasmid. It consists of a pKOI backbone with an additional expression cassette that encodes the first 115 amino acids (aa) of the precursor sequence of the PLA1 gene and the mature human DNase I (aa 23 to 281). The PLA1 pre/pro-peptide (aa 1 to 110) has significant similarity to members of the cathepsin L family and mediates secretion into the medium[24]. The five additional amino acids (aa 111 to 115) should ensure an optimal cleavage of the pro PLA1-DNaseI fusion protein by endogenous pro-peptidases. In contrast to the neo2 cassette the expression of the ppPLA115-DNase I fusion protein is regulated by the inducible MTT1 promoter[25]. The inducible system was selected because it allows a clear discrimination between the DNase activity of heterologously expressed recombinant human DNase I and the basal activity due to at least two endogenous DNases. The transformation, selection of positive clones and the directed allelic assortment were done as described in the material and methods section.",
                        "Furthermore, we tested the correct and complete integration of both expression cassettes (neo2 and the DNase I) in the DHFR-TS locus by a PCR approach (figure 6). In order to demonstrate the pKOI concept, cells of these DHFR-TS knock out strains carrying the ppPLA115-DNase expression cassette were treated with and without Cadmium. Only induced strains showed an elevated DNase activity in the supernatant (Figure 7). To confirm this enzymatic data a specific antiserum against human DNase I was used to analyse the cell extracts and the supernatant of these human DNase expressing DHFR-TS knock out strains by Western blot. The results illustrate that the DHFR-TS knock out strains are capable of expressing and secreting the functional recombinant human protein (Figure 8)."

                "It is well known that altering the cell's phenotype ultimately needs direct or indirect (by MIC transformation and conjugation) genetic engineering of the vegetative MAC. The first approaches for heterologous expression were done by using plasmids that use the vast amplification of the rDNA gene during anlagen/MAC development. However, the episomal presence of these plasmids depends on the drug concentration and the plasmid may recombine homologously and non-directionally into endogenous rDNA units.",
                "Stable integration of expression cassettes into diploid MIC can be achieved by biolistic bombardment. After conjugation of two different mating types the old MACs disappear and new ones form that carry the new information derived from the recombinant MIC. The whole process follows the statistics of the Mendelian genetics. The advantage of this approach is that one obtains stable clones that maintain the genetic properties and that can be crossed via classical genetics to combine various properties of different T. thermophila strains. This approach is elaborative and time consuming. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that scan RNAs (snRNA) derived from the old MAC play an important role in DNA elimination during the development of the somatic MAC from the germline MIC (see [27] for review). The primary sequence of these small RNAs explains how the parental MAC epigenetically controls the genome rearrangement in the new MAC. In the case of stable MIC transformants this RNAi-like mechanism may cause partial deletion of foreign expression cassettes in the developing new MAC [28].",
                "Therefore instead of episomal transformation by rDNA based plasmids or the stable transformation of the MIC we used a shortcut by combining MAC transformation with allelic assortment. This combination has several advantages. Firstly, the MAC transformation is much more efficient because there are at least about 45 potential integration sites per gene locus. This increases the probability of integration to at least one order of magnitude. Secondly, not only conjugating but also non-conjugating and therefore defined strains can be transformed. This is very important, because it allows the stepwise improvement of strains by maintaining defined genetic properties. Thirdly after completed allelic assortment the use of any antibiotic is obsolete as wildtype alleles have vanished in a one-way-manner. This allows cheap cultivation at large scales for e.g. biotechnical production processes."

The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 and 5 % skim milk (PBS-TM). The expression of recombinant human DNase I in transformed Ciliates was detected by two specific anti sera from rabbit against human DNase I (antigen: recombinant human DNase I, Pulmozyme, Roche). Both sera detected the recombinant DNase I antigen. The serum was used in a 1:500 dilution in PBS-TM. After washing with PBS/T and applying an HRP-conjugated anti rabbit serum. The blots were developed by using chemiluminescence."

Absorbance was measured at 620 nm. Calibration of the assay was achieved by different amounts of defined DNase I Units of Pulmozyme from Roche (CHO derived) in each experiment and linear regression. These results combined with semi-quantitative Western blotting were used to calculate the specific activity of expressed DNase I."
