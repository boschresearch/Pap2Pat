                        "Tetrahymena is a ciliated eukaryotic unicellular organism belonging to the regnum of Protozoa and bearing two nuclei, a transcriptionally silent, diploid germline micronucleus (MIC) and a transcriptionally active, polyploid somatic macronucleus (MAC). In 1923, when Nobel Laureate Andre Lwoff succeeded in growing Tetrahymena in pure culture, the basis for exploiting this alveolate as a model organism was laid. Milestone discoveries made in Tetrahymena are the discovery of dynein motors, telomeres, RNA-mediated catalysis, telomerase and the function of histone acetyltransferases in transcription regulation. Within the last decades molecular biological techniques have been developed to alter Tetrahymena's genome and proteome: DNA transfection methods comprise inter alia microinjection into the MAC by electroporation and biolistic bombardment of MIC and MAC. Episomal plasmids based on an rDNA-replicon are available, as well as knock-out/-in techniques based on homologous recombination. On protein level, heterologous expression of related species has been performed and also endogenous proteins were silenced by a novel antisense-ribosome-technique. The advantages of using Tetrahymena in biotechnological applications include fast growth, high biomass, fermentation in ordinary bacterial/yeast equipment, up-scalability as well as existence of cheap and chemically defined media.",
                        "So far, only a few markers that can be used in Tetrahymena have been described: ribosomal point mutation mediated resistances, a plasmid based neomycin resistance and a complicated beta-tubulin selection marker making use of an inducible promotor in combination with mutated tubulins being resistant/sensitive to the mitotic drug taxol1. Yet no true auxotrophic marker is available that permits selection without the use of antibiotics or drugs. This is where the present invention applies."

                        "Critical enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis are the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS). DHFR catalyses the production of tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate; TS is in charge of transferring a methyl-group from N5, N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate to dUMP thereby generating dTMP and tetrahydrofolate. These enzymes being crucial for pyrimidine synthesis have been used as auxotrophic markers in various systems by targeted gene disruption, but also a number of inhibitors (antifolates) have been developed as anti parasite drugs. In animals, fungi and eubacteria the DHFR and TS gene are separately translated, whereas plants, Alveolata and Euglenozoa have a bifunctional fusion gene with both enzyme activities combined in one protein (\u201cDHFR-TS\u201d).",
                        "The occurrence of the bifunctional enzyme in Tetrahymena pyriformis has been postulated in 19842 and 19853 but no functional or even molecular biological analysis had been performed. A partial amino acid sequence of DHFR-TS of a non determined \u201cT. pyriformis-like strain\u201d has been published in 20014, but this work is lacking any proof of linkage of the described partial cDNA to enzyme function.",
                        "The present invention provides a detailed characterization of the T. thermophila DHFR-TS gene including gene structure and functional data on the enzyme including data on in vivo function. In addition to a simple auxotrophic marker that is described for the first time in ciliates, the combination of these results with certain uncommon properties of Tetrahymena yields a surprisingly powerful tool for development and discovery of new antifolates against parasitic apicomplexans like for example Plasmodium sp. (malaria), Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) and Cryptosporidium sp. (cryptosporidiosis).",
                        "Great efforts are being made to fight these most severe worldwide problems by targeting the DHFR-TS of the above mentioned parasites by antifolates. Initial success in the fight against malaria has been overcome by the rise of drug resistant Plasmodium strains. Especially in the case of malaria the diversity of DHFR-TS is manifold due to the occurrence of different strains (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale) and high frequency of DNA-recombination/-mutations producing new resistances over and over again. By revealing the crystal structure of the mutated and thereby resistant DHFR-TS enzymes, new small molecule drugs are being developed by computer aided molecular modelling. The major problem is the testing of the drug candidates for efficacy: As endoparasites are difficult to culture and have an unusual complex life cycle direct testing of the new compounds is nearly impossible. A detour has been described, that makes use of dhr1 gene deficient yeast strains5 expressing the functional, parasitic DHFR-TS enzyme of interest thereby reconstituting the dhr1 deficiency. However this approach has a lot of disadvantages: The codon usage of parasitic apicomplexans, is very different from all commonly used expression-systems like E. coli, yeast and mammalian cell-lines and some tRNAs needed for translation are not abundant in these model organisms. Apicomplexa/Sporozoa, belonging to the phylogenetic group of Alveolata, possess a number of special cell biological features, the most notable being the presence of cortical alveoli, flattened vesicles packed into a continuous layer supporting the membrane. No model organism described so far has this assortment of special properties that will influence drug uptake and virtue.",
                        "All the problems mentioned above can be overcome by the use of Tetrahymena:",
                        "It belongs to the Alveolata and is the most closely related species to apicomplexans. Tetrahymena is capable of growing in chemical defined media without the presence of thymidine arguing for a functional salvage pathway for dTMP synthesis by a bifunctional DHFR-TS enzyme. Deficiency in this enzyme activity should yield cell lines that only grow in media supplemented with thymidine. To destruct DHFR-TS activity various common techniques can be used like e.g. targeted gene knockout, site directed mutagenesis of essential amino acids and random mutagenesis. Screening for DHFR-TS deficient clones can be performed by replica plated culturing in media with (T+) or without thymidine (T\u2212). Potential clones should only grow in T+but not in T\u2212. Successful reconstitution of enzyme activity can be achieved by transforming aforementioned cells with DNA fragments encoding for a functional DHFR-TS enzyme yielding cells that will grow on T\u2212. This method allows selection of transformands without using drugs or antibiotics. In case of the exogenous, recombinant DHFR-TS being derived from parasitic apicomplexans an ideal model system for antifolate drug screening is achieved that can readily be used in a high throughput system.",

The MIC is the germline nucleus, i.e. it stores the genetic information for sexual progeny. The MIC is diploid and contains five pairs of chromosomes. In contrast to this the MAC is the somatic nucleus and no MAC DNA is transmitted to sexual progeny. The MAC contains 200-300 autonomously replicating pieces (ARP) that are derived from the MIC. Each of these units is present at about 45 copies except for the rDNA gene that is independently amplified to ca. 10000 copies per cell. The MAC DNA is the transcribed DNA and therefore responsible for the actual phenotype of T. thermophila cells.",
                                "It is obvious that genetic engineering ultimately needs the transformation of the functional MAC that is in charge of protein expression. The first approaches for heterologous expression were done by using plasmids that use the vast amplification of the rDNA gene during MAC development. However the episomal presence of these plasmids depends on the drug concentration and the plasmid may recombine homologously and non-directionally into endogenous rDNA units.",
                                "The more promising way is the stable transformation of cells. This means the stable integration of expression cassettes into the MAC and or/the MIC of T. thermophila. MIC transformation can be achieved by stably transforming the chromosomal DNA of the diploid MIC. After conjugation of two different mating types the old MACs of the conjugating cells disappear and new MACs were built in the progenies derived from the recombinant MICs that carry the new information. The whole process follows the statistics of the Mendelian genetics. The advantage of this approach is that one obtains stable clones that maintain the genetic properties and that can be crossed via classical genetics to combine various properties of different T. thermophila strains. This approach is very elaborative and time consuming. Furthermore, it was shown recently that scan RNAs derived from the old MAC play an important role in DNA elimination during the development of the somatic MAC from the germline MIC. The primary sequence of these small RNAs explains how the parental MAC epigenetically controls the genome rearrangement in the new MAC. In the case of stable MIC transformants this RNAi-like mechanism inhibits the establishment and maintenance of foreign expression cassettes in the developing new MAC.",
                                "Instead of episomal transformation by rDNA based plasmids or the stable transformation of the MIC a shortcut by the combination of stable MAC transformation with an immediate allelic assortment approach was used. This combination has several advantages. Firstly, the MAC transformation is much more efficient because there are at least about 45 potential integration sites per gene locus. Secondly, not only conjugating but also non-conjugating and therefore defined strains can be transformed. Finally, the recently reported genome rearrangements in the developing MAC that are regulated by scan RNA mechanisms can be short-circuited by MAC-transformation combined with allelic assortment.",

                                "To start the DHFR-TS knock out experiments the plasmid pKOI was constructed (FIG. 2). The neo2 cassette of pH4T2 was used to monitor the successful uptake of the plasmid by selection against paromomycin. The neo2 cassette of pKOI is flanked by the 1.5 kb fragments of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 region of the non-coding regions of the DHFR-TS gene, respectively (FIG. 2). Because pKOI lacks an appropriate origin of replication, paromomycin resistant T. thermophila clones argue for a proper homologous recombination event in the DHFR-TS gene locus. Nevertheless, the most convincing evidence for the correct integration into the DHFR-TS locus is a loss of the DHFR-TS activity in the transformed strain. In the case of ciliates this requires the all complete replacement of all chromosomal DHFR-TS wildtype alleles (\u02dc45 ARPs) by the ARPs that includes the knock out cassette. We achieved this by allelic assortment. This allelic or phenotypic assortment is based on randomised distribution of the MAC chromosomes units (ARPs) during mitosis. In order to force the assortment process into the desired direction\u2014namely into the recombinant resistance gene\u2014the transformed cells were cultivated for at least 2-3 weeks using increasing concentrations of the drug paromomycin. Single clones were isolated and tested for DHFR-TS deficiency by using a minimal chemical defined medium (CDM) with (+T) and without thymidine (\u2212T). In FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 it is demonstrated that the found DHFR-TS knock out clones are real auxotrophic strains: The mutants are able to grow in CDM with thymidine like wildtype strains or strains with an incomplete allelic assortment. In CDM lacking thymidine they are unable to grow (see FIG. 4 and FIG. 5).",

For this purpose the pKOI DVL plasmid was constructed.

In contrast to the neo2 cassette the expression of the ppPLA115-DNase I fusion protein is regulated by the inducible MTT1 promotor. The inducible system was selected because it allows a clear discrimination between the DNase activity of heterologously expressed recombinant human DNase I and the basal activity due to at least two endogenous DNases. According to this the inducible system was also selected in the case of Lipase because it allows a clear discrimination between the basal level of the endogenous Lipase activity and homologous overexpressed endogenous Lipase acitivity. The transformation, selection of positive clones and the directed allelic assortment were done as outlined in example 1. Furthermore, the correct and complete integration of both expression cassettes (neo2 and the DNase I) in the DHFR-TS locus was tested by a PCR approach. FIG. 6 shows that this is the case.",

As already mentioned in the introduction, this phylogenetic group consists of the Ciliata, Dinoflagellata and Apicomplexa/Sporozoa.

Due to the close phylogenetic relationship it is also possible to recover the DHFR-TS activity in deficient Tetrahymena strains by DHFR-TS enzymes from other members of the Alveolata group. This implies the application of DHFR-TS deficient T. thermophila strains in searching for and testing novel anti DHFR-TS drugs (antifolates). This is of very high importance because antifolates have been one of the most promising drugs in the fight against malaria. The fact that anti DHFR-TS drugs have been administered for a long time in e.g. malaria patients is the reason that during the last decades many of the parasites became resistant. At present many approaches are being explored to find new and more specific and efficient drugs against the parasite DHFR-TS enzyme. As the search for new antifolates relies on structure determination using NMR and crystallization techniques, most of these approaches are very time and cost intensive.",

Thus the DHFR-TS deficient strains recovered by the homologous bienzyme of the parasites represent a simple and flexible in vivo test system conferrable to other disease causing parasites of the Apicomplexa group. For example antifolates against Plasmodium vivax strains have not been considered because no appropriate and flexible in vivo system for high throughput approaches was available. This can be done easily by recovering the DHFR-TS activity of T. thermophila strains by using the homologous bienzymes of Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale as well as enzymes from Apicomplexa/Sporozoa that cause toxoplasmosis or cryptosporidiosis. FIG. 9 illustrates this concept. The DHFR-TS enzyme of the pyrimethamine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 was used to recover the DHFR-TS activity in a T. thermophila strain, lacking DHFR-TS activity. In parallel a DHFR-TS from a Plasmodium falciparum strain that is resistant against the pyrimethamine treatment (for example the DHFR-TS S108N mutant) is tested. By measuring the effect of pyrimethamine in dose response curves on the two different transformands drug resistance and sensitivity can be determined easily. Subsequently new potential drugs can be added to the medium to show effectiveness on yet resistant DHFR-TS mutants."
