                        "This invention relates to an apparatus for energy efficient stimulation. The apparatus can utilize non-rectangular waveforms to further improve efficiency. In one example, a variable compliance regulator can be connected to supply a dynamic compliance voltage to a power supply rail of a stimulator apparatus. The compliance voltage can vary (e.g., continuously) based on a stimulus waveform. By dynamically varying the compliance voltage in this manner, a pulse generator can provide an output waveform to one or more outputs based on the stimulus waveform for energy efficient delivery of electrical therapy. As disclosed herein, additional improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved through optimizations to other stimulation parameters (e.g., waveform shape and/or pulse width) to further increase the efficiency.",

The system 10 includes a power source 12 that supplies power for the system 10. For example, the power source 12 can be a battery that supplies a voltage VBAT to a power input terminal 14 of a stimulation apparatus 16.",

For simplicity of illustration, the example of FIG. 1 includes a single output; although there can be any number of output channels. The system 10, including the power source and the stimulation apparatus 16, can be implemented as an implantable stimulation device in a self-contained housing that is hermetically sealed and capable of percutaneous implantation in a patient (e.g., human or other animal).",
                        "The stimulation apparatus 16 can include an arrangement of circuitry that efficiently operates by dynamically managing power consumption during operation. The apparatus 16 includes a variable compliance regulator 20 that is connected to the power input terminal 14. The variable compliance regulator 20 can be implemented as a power converter (e.g., a DC-DC power converter) configured to supply a compliance voltage VCOMP to a power supply rail 22. The variable compliance regulator 20 can dynamically vary the compliance voltage VCOMP according to an output waveform, as disclosed herein. Pulse generation circuitry 28 can be coupled to the power supply rail 22 to operate based on the compliance voltage VCOMP. The stimulation apparatus 16 can include one or more other voltage regulators (not shown) that can supply substantially fixed regulated voltage (e.g., a low voltage, such as about 3 V to about 5.5 V) for powering other circuitry in the stimulation apparatus 16.",
                        "The apparatus 16 can include a controller 24 configured to control operation of the apparatus. The controller 24 can provides a control signal 26, corresponding to a stimulus waveform, to the pulse generator 28 for controlling the pulse generator to provide an output electrical signal (e.g., a current waveform) at the output 18. As mentioned above, the stimulation apparatus 16 can include one or more outputs 18 corresponding to different output channels that can be controlled independently of each other, such as to provide respective output waveforms to associated electrodes. Each output 18 can be coupled to an electrode 30. Thus, there can be any number of electrodes and each such electrode can be dimensioned and configured according to application requirements. For example, the electrodes can be configured for delivery of electrical therapy to a target site or region in a patient, such as may be in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, vagus nerve, nerves for controlling bladder function, the heart or the like. In one example, the electrode can be formed of Iridium Oxide or include an Iridium Oxide coating.",
                        "The controller 24 can be programmed to define parameters of the stimulus waveform 26 such as based on an input. The input demonstrated in the example of FIG. 1 is intended to represent various types of inputs that stimulation apparatus 16 can receive. For example, the input can be provided from an external device to program the stimulation parameters. The input thus can be provided via a physical connection (e.g., an electrical or optical link) or a wireless connection. Additionally or alternatively, the input can be provided by circuitry (not shown) in the system 10 that provides an indication of one or more sensed parameters (e.g., tissue impedance surrounding the electrode, electrophysiological signals sensed from the patient, feedback, such as voltage or current measurements, from circuitry in the system 10).",
                        "For example, the controller can dynamically vary or maintain the output VCOMP of the compliance regulator 20 based on feedback measured from other circuit elements in the stimulation path. Such feedback can include voltage or current measurements (e.g. a series component, electrode potential, measured sag in the compliance voltage, potential drop across a current source, e.g., a FET, stimulus current, and the like).",
                        "The stimulus waveform parameters for a given output can include amplitude, waveform shape, frequency (e.g., activation time), and pulse width (e.g., duration). Various waveform shapes can be utilized, which can vary depending on capabilities of the system 10 as well as the type and purpose of the electrical therapy being delivered.",
                        "FIG. 2 demonstrates example of a stimulus waveform 36 demonstrating phases of a stimulation period. For example, the stimulation apparatus 16 can use charge-balanced, biphasic, rectangular stimulus waveforms. As shown in the waveform 36, each stimulation period can be composed of three variable phases: a stimulus pulse 38, an interphase interval, and a recharge pulse. The stimulus pulse 38 has an amplitude and pulse width 40, both of which can be programmed according to energy requirements and charge threshold levels, for example. The example of FIG. 2 shows a rectangular pulse; however, it is to be understood that increased energy efficiency according to embodiments disclosed herein, are achieved via non-rectangular waveforms. When considering non-rectangular pulses, the definition of pulse width becomes less clear, and can skew the interpretation of results. For purposes of consistency, the pulse width of each waveform can be represented by the full width at half maximum amplitude (FWHM). As a further example, waveforms can be constructed such that the interphase interval lasts 0.1 ms, followed by a 5.0 ms passive-recharge phase, which coincides with 136 Hz stimulation using modern DBS devices. Other phase timing can also be utilized.",
                        "Examples of waveform shapes that can be provided by the controller 24 include rectangular, right triangular, centered triangular, increasing ramp, decreasing ramp, increasing exponential, decreasing exponential, Gaussian, sinusoidal, and trapezoidal to name a few. In response to the stimulus waveforms from the controller 24, corresponding electrical current (or voltage) waveforms can be generated by the pulse generator 28. The waveforms may be analog waveforms or the shapes may be step-wise (e.g., discrete) approximations, which can vary depending on the implementation of the pulse generator 28 and controller 24. Examples of equations that can be used to generate various types of output current waveforms (I) from the pulse generator 28 are provided in the following table, where \u03c4pw is the desired pulse width, I0 is the amplitude, t is time and a and \u03b1 are coefficients:",
                        "Energy and charge requirements can be determined for each waveform and pulse width using a corresponding threshold amplitude. The energy (E) of each cathodic stimulus of the waveform period can be ascertained by integration of the instantaneous power as follows:",

                        "As a further example, a passive anodic recharge phase is assumed. Consequently, the foregoing equation presumes to calculate stimulus energy only for the cathodic (stimulus) phase. The charge injected during stimulus can be determined (Q) by integrating the current over the cathodic (e.g., stimulus) phase (Tc):",
                        "Q=\u222b0TI(t)dt",

                        "As a further example, the input to the controller 24 can set stimulation parameters for a patient. For example, the input can select a type of waveform that is to be applied. The input can also define a pulse width for the stimulus waveform. Alternatively, or additionally, the controller 24 can determine the pulse width based on other information provided via the input. For example, the pulse width can be set as a function of the type of neuron, neuron anatomy (e.g., fiber diameter) and the type of waveform.",
                        "As another example, FIG. 4 depicts an example of a simulated population of fibers, indicated at 80, having varying diameters distributed 1 mm in each direction around a point of origin. The gray-scaling of the fibers represents simulated extracellular voltage in response to apply about 1 mA pulse at a point source located at the origin. Also shown in FIG. 4 is a graph 82 of normalized energy versus pulse width (in \u03bcs), which include plots for different diameter fibers. The graph 82 thus demonstrates the dependence of energy on the pulse width for use in stimulating neuron fibers of different diameters. The graph 82 demonstrates the normalized energy as a function of the pulse width for three different size fibers, namely a 2 micron fiber (e.g., stimulated with a pulse width of about 350 \u03bcs), a 5.7 micron fiber (e.g., a pulse width about 200 \u03bcs) and a 10 micron fiber (e.g., a pulse width of about 170 \u03bcs).",
                        "As shown in FIG. 4, it can be shown that the pulse widths at which the energy was minimized decreased as the fiber diameter increased. This relationship can be consistent for all fiber diameters (e.g., from about 2 \u03bcm to about 16 \u03bcm). The mean threshold energy for the most efficient pulse width was 0.21 nJ for large diameter fibers (10.0 \u03bcm), exhibited at a pulse width of 180 \u03bcs. The largest diameter fibers in this example (16.0 \u03bcm) exhibit a nearly identical mean minimum threshold energy (0.18 nJ for 140 \u03bcs). The mean minimum energy for small diameter fibers (2.0 \u03bcm) may be nearly five times higher (0.98 nJ) for waveforms at a longer pulse width (380 \u03bcs). Since peripheral stimulation typically recruits larger diameter neurons, it can be predicted that the energy-optimal rectangular waveforms should have a pulse width in the 100-200 \u03bcs range. Alternatively, other types of stimulation (e.g., central stimulation) for smaller diameter fibers may benefit from longer duration pulses, such as having a pulse width in the 300-400 \u03bcs range.",
                        "As shown in the example of FIG. 4, energy requirements initially dropped as pulse-widths were increased, until they reached a minimum value, at which point they began to increase. This minimum value can be determined for a given application and utilized to program the pulse width of the stimulus waveform. The pulse-width corresponding to this minimum energy threshold varied for each waveform, ranging from about 250 \u03bcs (exponentially increasing), to about 500 \u03bcs (rectangular).",
                        "It has also been determined that an increased pulse width (as compared to a rectangular pulse) can be utilized for non-rectangular pulses. In one example, the centered triangular waveform (e.g., having a larger pulse width of about 500 \u03bcs) can minimize energy. Additionally, at short pulse-widths (<200 \u03bcs), all non-rectangular waveforms have been determined to be more energy efficient than equal pulse-width rectangular waveforms.",
                        "Referring back to FIG. 2, the controller 24 can be programmed to compute the pulse width based on information received via the input or the pulse width can be explicitly defined in the input provided to the controller. The amplitude for the stimulus pulse can also be defined via the input or the controller 24 can be programmed to determine the amplitude depending on the waveform type and pulse width, for example. The set of parameters can thus be optimized for energy efficiency. Thus, the pulse width can be set by the controller 24 to be inversely proportional to a diameter of target neuron fibers to be stimulated. The pulse width can further vary depending on the shape of the waveform that is utilized. In one example, for narrow diameter fibers having a diameter of 6 \u03bcm or less (e.g., typically ranging from about 1 \u03bcm to about 6 \u03bcm for fibers in the central nervous system), the pulse width of a non-rectangular waveform, such as the centered triangular waveform, can be set to greater than or equal to about 200 \u03bcs or greater (e.g., ranging from about 200 \u03bcs to about 1000 \u03bcs). Conversely, for larger diameter fibers having a diameter greater than or equal to about 10 \u03bcm (e.g., typically ranging from about 12 \u03bcm to about 20 \u03bcm), the pulse width of the non-rectangular waveform can be set to less than or equal to 200 \u03bcs (e.g., ranging about 50 \u03bcs to about 200 \u03bcs).",
                        "By way of further example, the stimulation parameters can be established in a programming session. For instance, a set of coarse stimulation parameters can be established (e.g., via the input to the controller) initially based on a target volume of activation determined for the patient. The stimulation parameters can then be fine tuned via a calibration process. The calibration process may involve manual, automatic or both manual and automatic calibration methods.",
                        "In addition to selecting an energy efficient waveform and stimulation parameters, the programming can also include configuring the variable compliance regulator to operate dynamically. As mentioned above, the variable compliance regulator 20 can dynamically vary the amplitude compliance voltage VCOMP commensurate with variations in the amplitude of the stimulus waveform 26 provided by the controller and/or the output waveform provided at 18. For example, the stimulus waveform can be provided to logic (e.g., a FPGA, microcontroller or other circuitry) 32 to generate a control signal to cause the compliance voltage VCOMP to follow the shape and amplitude of the stimulus waveform over time.",
                        "As an example, if the variable compliance regulator 20 is implemented as DC-DC switched mode (e.g., boost) converter, the stimulus waveform can be combined with a predetermined minimum potential (e.g., via an adder) to provide a combined reference signal. The combined reference signal can be utilized to generate a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal that controls the output voltage of the converter accordingly. For instance, the PWM signal can be applied to one or more output field effect transistors of the boost converter. The predetermined minimum potential, for example, can correspond to a minimum compliance voltage for other circuitry in the apparatus 16. The minimum compliance voltage can be fixed or it can be variable depending on other operating parameters of the system 10. In this way, the compliance voltage VCOMP can continuously vary (e.g., in an analog manner or in discrete steps) during a cathodic portion of the output pulse at 18.",
                        "In the foregoing example, it is assumed that the power requirements of the internal circuitry remain substantially constant during delivery of electrical therapy. However, in addition to tracking the shape and amplitude of the stimulus waveform, the variable compliance regulator 20 can optimize the compliance voltage to dynamically vary according to power consumption of other circuitry in the system 10, such as by adjusting the minimum potential based on one or more operating parameters of the system 10. Thus, the variable compliance regulator 20 can vary the compliance voltage dynamically based on a combination of operating parameters, including the waveform shape/amplitude as well as energy requirements of internal circuitry of the apparatus 16 that cooperate to generate the electrical therapy and control other functionality of the system 10. The power utilization of such circuitry further can vary depending on parameters of the electrical therapy being delivered such as pulse width and frequency.",
                        "Additionally, the compliance voltage VCOMP can be fixed or variable during the anodic phase of the output waveform. During the anodic phase or in between pulses the variable compliance regulator 20 can also substantially optimize the compliance voltage VCOMP to accommodate the power consumption of the internal circuitry that is driven by the rail 22. As described above, this can be implemented by dynamically varying the gate signals used to gate output one or more output transistors according to energy requirements of circuitry during the anodic phase.",
                        "The controller 24 can also control operation of the variable compliance regulator 20 such as between dynamic, adjustable and fixed modes. The controller 24 can select the mode based on one or more detected operating conditions and provide one or more control signals to the variable compliance regulator 20 for setting the mode of voltage regulation. In the dynamic mode, the variable compliance regulator 20 dynamically varies the compliance voltage based on the stimulus waveform shape. The variable compliance regulator 20 can further dynamically and/or other variable power consumption requirements, as disclosed herein.",
                        "In the adjustable mode, the variable compliance regulator 20 can change the compliance voltage between discrete levels (e.g., a higher voltage during the pulse and a lower voltage between pulses) but the compliance voltage is not continuously varied as in the dynamic operating mode. In the fixed mode, the regulator maintains the compliance voltage at a predetermined fixed level.",
                        "As another example, the controller 24 can compare the peak stimulation amplitude for a selected stimulus waveform. If the peak stimulation amplitude requires a compliance voltage that is less than the battery voltage VBAT, the controller 24 can operate the variable compliance regulator 20 in the fixed mode. If the controller 24 determines that peak stimulation amplitude exceeds the battery voltage VBAT but by an amount that is less than a predetermined threshold voltage, the controller can operate the variable compliance regulator 20 in the adjustable mode. The predetermined threshold voltage can be programmed to correspond to the expected additional energy consumption that results from implementing the dynamic mode relative to the energy consumption in the adjustable mode (e.g., VTHRESHOLD\u02dcENERGYDYNAMIC\u2212ENERGYADJUSTABLE). Thus, the adjustable mode can be utilized in situations when the additional increase in energy consumption for implementing the dynamic mode over the adjustable mode would not result in an increase in energy efficiency.",
                        "FIG. 5 depicts graphs demonstrating examples of different energy optimization strategies that can be implemented in an implantable pulse generator (IPG) based on the teachings hereon. In the example of FIG. 5, a graph 50 plots charge (in \u03bcC) versus pulse width, for a stimulation apparatus implementing a fixed compliance voltage. As shown, since energy is equal to voltage times charge, this results in generally monotonically increasing charge requirements with longer pulse widths. This remains true with different waveform types although the energy requirements differ.",
                        "Other graphs 52 and 54 in FIG. 5 plot an energy threshold (in nJ) versus pulse width (in ms) for both an stimulation apparatus (e.g., apparatus 16 of FIG. 1) implementing an adjustable compliance voltage (e.g., an adjustable mode) and dynamic compliance voltage (e.g., a dynamic mode), respectively. The energy threshold corresponds to an amount of energy required to achieve a percentage of activation. A comparison between the plot 52 for the adjustable compliance voltage and the plot 54 for the dynamic compliance voltage demonstrates a significance decrease in energy as a function of pulse width with the dynamic compliance voltage.",
                        "Additionally, the graph 54 for the dynamic compliance voltage example demonstrates how different pulse shapes results in different energy thresholds over a range of pulse widths. For example, the graph 54 includes plots for two example stimulus waveform shapes, namely, a rectangular stimulus waveform and a centered triangular waveform. From the plots in the graph 54, it is demonstrated that a centered triangular waveform results in a decreased energy threshold for a given pulse width as compared to a conventional rectangular waveform.",
                        "FIG. 6 demonstrates additional examples of graphs power, current and voltage for each of a fixed compliance voltage, adjustable compliance voltage and dynamic compliance voltage, indicated at 60, 62 and 64, respectively. Each of the example graphs 60, 62 and 64 further demonstrates differences between the load power and voltage and the compliance power and voltage, respectively. For example, in the adjustable compliance voltage scenario 62 the power for the compliance voltage is about 416 \u03bcJ, whereas the load power was about 218 \u03bcJ. In contrast, for the centered triangular waveform employed in the dynamic compliance voltage example 64, the power due to the dynamic compliance is about 396 \u03bcJ and the power due to the load is about 192 \u03bcJ. Thus, the example of FIG. 6 demonstrates the power savings associated with a dynamic compliance voltage verses each of a fixed and adjustable compliance voltage. Additionally, a larger pulse width can be utilized for the dynamic compliance voltage than in cases where either a fixed or adjustable compliance voltage is used. Thus, as a result of the dynamic compliance voltage, a user can selectively determine a desired width for target tissue to be stimulated, which is in contrast to systems utilizing a fixed compliance voltage.",

In each of these example graphs 70 and 74, the same type of stimulus waveforms and pulse width were used, but due to the reduced compliance voltage it is shown that a power savings of about 20 \u03bcJ can be achieved using the variable compliance voltage given the same output waveforms. Further power savings can be achieved by employing a dynamically varying compliance voltage and/or employing a non-rectangular waveform (e.g., centered-triangular waveform) as disclosed herein.",

For example, a corresponding voltage rail can itself operate as the current driver for delivery of the output waveform to the load. In this implementation, the controller (e.g., the controller 24 of FIG. 1 or control system 102 of FIG. 2) can adjust a corresponding voltage driver, which is coupled to provide an output voltage to the rail, based on the stimulus waveform. For instance, the controller can dynamically vary the voltage rail (via its control of the voltage driver) as to maintain the current through the load based on a sensed parameter (e.g., a feedback measurement from the load). This could be implemented in the context of FIG. 10 by replacing the regulator 270 with a dynamic voltage driver, removing the current generator 266 and configuring the controller with the functionality as just described.
