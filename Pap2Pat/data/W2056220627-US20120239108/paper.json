    "abstract": "The delivery of therapeutic levels of electrical current to neural tissue is a well-established treatment for numerous indications such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain. While the neuromodulation medical device industry has experienced steady clinical growth over the last two decades, much of the core technology underlying implanted pulse generators remain unchanged. In this study we propose some new methods for achieving increased energy-efficiency during neural stimulation. The first method exploits the biophysical features of excitable tissue through the use of a centered-triangular stimulation waveform. Neural activation with this waveform is achieved with a statistically significant reduction in energy compared to traditional rectangular waveforms. The second method demonstrates energy savings that could be achieved by advanced circuitry design. We show that the traditional practice of using a fixed compliance voltage for constant-current stimulation results in substantial energy loss. A portion of this energy can be recuperated by adjusting the compliance voltage to real-time requirements. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential impact of axon fiber diameter on defining the energy-optimal pulse-width for stimulation. When designing implantable pulse generators for energy efficiency, we propose that the future combination of a variable compliance system, a centered-triangular stimulus waveform, and an axon diameter specific stimulation pulse-width has great potential to reduce energy consumption and prolong battery life in neuromodulation devices.",

                "The delivery of therapeutic levels of electrical current to excitable tissue is a well-established treatment for numerous diseases and disorders. Neuromodulation devices have been implanted in hundreds of thousands of patients for numerous FDA approved applications that include deep brain stimulation (DBS) [1], spinal cord stimulation (SCS) [2] and cochlear stimulation [3]. Clinical neuromodulation technologies typically rely on an implanted pulse generator (IPG) to deliver electrical stimuli. The fundamental goal of stimulation is to generate action potentials in axons near the implanted electrode that modulate the release of neurotransmitters in specific parts of the nervous system. However, the basic stimulation hardware and stimulus waveform used in clinical practice have remained relatively unchanged for decades. We propose that there exist numerous opportunities to improve IPG function, particularly to increase the energy efficiency of stimulation. This study presents a range of methods that decrease power consumption by exploiting the biophysical features of stimulated tissue, and minimizing the energy consumption of the IPG electronic circuitry.",
                "Clinical neuromodulation devices are typically powered using a hermetically sealed medical grade energy cell (battery) that is located within the IPG package. The cell\u2019s energy capacity and lifetime is dictated by its size (volume) and chemistry. The cell\u2019s lifetime (or recharge interval for rechargeable cells) is dictated by the energy capacity and energy depletion rate across each of the functional circuit elements. The stimulation circuitry typically consumes the largest share of the energy; hence, its design and implementation represent compelling targets for optimizing IPG energy consumption.",
                "The power consumed during constant-current electrical stimulation is largely dictated by two fundamental elements: the current source and the electrode/tissue load. During stimulation, a current is applied across the tissue. The current source is typically implemented with transistor technologies to deliver a constant current over the stimulus pulse, regardless of the voltage generated across the electrodes. Traditional constant-current stimulators rely on a fixed compliance voltage (see Figure 1) that provides the driving potential to deliver current across the tissue load. This compliance voltage is application dependent and is generally fixed to a value larger than absolutely necessary for the IPG current output specifications (e.g. stimulation with 10\u201325 V) [4]. This safety margin enables the device to operate normally even under extreme operating conditions of large load impedances or large stimulation current thresholds in a given patient. However, under normal operating conditions, this fixed high compliance voltage is excessive for stimulating the necessary neural tissue. In turn, the stimulator operates inefficiently due to the large voltage drop across the current source.",
                "When considering the neural tissue itself in the energy calculations, energy savings are also possible by optimizing the stimulus waveform shape and pulse duration used to generate action potentials with electrical stimulation [5], [6]. We recently reported on a computational model of neural stimulation where non-rectangular waveforms could achieve an energy savings of \u223c10% compared to an optimal rectangular pulse [7]. We found that the most energy-efficient waveform shape was a centered-triangular pulse (ramp-up phase followed by a symmetric ramp-down phase); however, in vivo verification of these theoretical savings has not been previously demonstrated.",
                "In this study we independently investigated multiple methodologies for maximizing the energy efficiency of a neural stimulator by exploiting both the biophysical features of stimulated tissue and the electronic circuit design of the IPG. We utilized measurements acquired in an in vivo rat preparation and in computer simulation to quantify the energy consumed by the current source and tissue/electrode load. We investigated the energy content of stimulation with different waveform shapes and pulse-widths, as well as analyzing the impact of minimizing the compliance voltage on IPG energy consumption. We found that the use of an adjustable compliance voltage in the pulse generator circuitry, and a biophysically optimized triangular stimulus waveform and pulse-width, can independently reduce energy consumption in neurostimulation applications."

A 5\u201310 mm length of the sciatic nerve was exposed under microscopic dissection proximally from the popliteal fossa. The gastrocnemius-soleus muscle complex was dissected, and the calcaneal (Achilles) tendon was severed from its distal attachment at the heel. The ipsilateral tibia was stabilized to the experimental rig via a clamp, and the calcaneal tendon was tethered to a force transducer with 1\u20132 N of passive tension. A monopolar nerve cuff electrode was placed on the exposed portion of the sciatic nerve as shown in Figure 2a. The electrode had a J-shaped cross-section and was made of silastic rubber with a 3 mm\u00d71 mm rectangular platinum contact for current delivery (the 1 mm dimension was along the longitudinal axis of the nerve) [9].

Threshold was estimated by delivering a 1 Hz train of stimulation pulses to the nerve, each with fractionally higher current amplitude than the previous pulse (incremental resolution was typically a few percent of threshold). As the current amplitude increased above threshold, the force level plateaued at the maximal contractile force (MCF). The MCF activation threshold amplitude was then back calculated from the first pulse that resulted in the MCF."

Stimulation was performed with either biphasic centered-triangular or rectangular waveforms [7] (Figure 2bc). Waveforms were designed with an interphase interval of 100 \u00b5s to ensure efficient biphasic stimulation (van den Honert and Mortimer 1979, McKay and Henshall 2003). Figure 2 shows the waveforms with simplified schematics representing how they could be generated by an IPG. For each animal, the biphasic stimulus waveforms were delivered to the sciatic nerve using a computer controlled function generator (AFG3021B, Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) coupled to a current-controlled output stage (bp Isolator, FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME, USA). The order in which the two waveform shapes (triangular or rectangular) were evaluated was randomized into four statistical blocks (two repeats of each waveform type). Within each block, six PWs (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 \u00b5s) were evaluated in a randomized order for the given waveform. The activation threshold was determined for each trial (i.e. each waveform and pulse combination within a block). Statistical differences were calculated using a paired t-test at each PW using the Matched Pairs tool in statistical software JMP (Version 9, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989\u20132010).

Typical clinical neurostimulation devices are programmed with rectangular pulses with relatively short PWs (60\u201390 \u00b5s). However, both theoretical [5] and experimental [11] data suggest that the energy dissipated in a tissue load at the activation threshold exhibits a non-monotonic, U-shaped relationship with PW, reaching a minimum near 200 \u00b5s. In addition, non-rectangular stimulus pulses (e.g. Gaussian or centered-triangular) have the potential to further reduce the energy consumption necessary for neural activation [6], [7].",

Rectangular stimulation pulses were delivered using a custom stimulator designed with an adjustable compliance voltage. A schematic of the constant-current stimulator is shown in Figure 3a. The transistor used was an N-channel field effect transistor (FET) model FDV301N (Fairchild Semiconductor, South Portland, ME, USA), that was biased to operate in the 0\u20132.0 mA range using our resistor network (R1\u200a=\u200a400 k\u2126; R2\u200a=\u200a60 k\u2126; R3\u200a=\u200a0\u201350 k\u2126). This stimulator included flexibility in PW, pulse amplitude and compliance voltage. The PW of the stimulation current was equal to that of a 5 V trigger pulse delivered to Vin. The amplitude of the current pulse was modulated by two 25 k\u2126 potentiometers in series (R3), which modulated the FET gate voltage during an active trigger pulse. The compliance voltage of this stimulator was adjusted manually using a bench power supply.",

When the trigger pulse was active, stimulation current flowed from the supply, through the load and the FET to ground (Figure 3ab). The voltage drop across the load (electrode and tissue) resulted in a drop in the voltage that was maintained across the FET when the stimulator was active. For insufficient compliance voltages, the voltage drop across the load was large enough to drop the FET out of the saturation-operating region, and the programmed current was not achieved. The programmed current was only achieved when the drain-source voltage of the FET was sufficient to keep it in the saturation region. The minimum required drain-source voltage to maintain operation is dependent on the current flowing through a given FET. In our experiments, the drain-source voltage was typically in the range 1.0\u20132.0 V.",

Three of the compliance voltages were fixed (5, 10 and 20 V), while the last was the minimal compliance voltage that maintained the constant current pulse shape (Vmin), determined iteratively by manual adjustment of the bench-top power supply.

First the PW of a TTL trigger (5 V; 1 Hz) and the compliance voltage of the stimulator were programmed. R3 was adjusted such that the current amplitude was set to the activation threshold amplitude. Vmin was determined by (1) determining the threshold amplitude with a large compliance voltage, (2) reducing the compliance voltage until the stimulator could no longer generate the MCF, with associated distortion of the constant-current stimulation pulse shape. Once the threshold amplitude was found, the signals Vcomp, VFET, Vload and Istim were acquired using the data-logging oscilloscope over the duration of the stimulation pulse (see Figure 3bcd). Briefly, VFET is the voltage drop across the FET (V2\u2013Vgnd), Vload is the voltage drop across the electrode-tissue load (V1\u2013V2) and Istim is the injected current into the electrode-tissue load, which is estimated by the voltage drop across a 1 k\u2126 series resistor:(3)",

This experimental finding is consistent with our results from a recent simulation study that estimated the savings of 10% when comparing the energy-optimal centered-triangular waveform with the energy-optimal rectangular waveform [7]. This reduction in power consumption via non-rectangular stimulus waveforms could have important implications on the circuit design of future IPG output stages.",
                "Over recent years, several patents have surfaced regarding implementation of variable compliance in neurostimulation applications [17], [18]. In turn, commercial neurostimulators may have already implemented variable compliance concepts into their devices. However, the implementation details, rationale, and estimated energy savings are not available in the public domain. In this paper, we demonstrate that minimization of compliance voltage dramatically improves the energy efficiency of stimulation, compared to the traditional use of a fixed compliance.",
                "For a fixed compliance voltage, energy consumption increases monotonically with PW. This relationship arises from the monotonic increase in charge consumption with increasing PW, meaning larger energy consumption (E\u200a=\u200aQ\u00b7Vcomp for constant voltage). However, minimization of compliance voltage results in a U-shaped, non-monotonic relationship between pulse-width and energy consumption. This relationship arises from the asymptotic nature of the strength-duration relationship [19]. Shorter PWs require exponentially larger amplitudes, leading to exponentially increasing power (P\u200a=\u200aIstim\u00b7Vcomp). Increasing the PW reduces the current necessary for activation, so if Vcomp is likewise reduced, the result is a reduction in power consumption. As the stimulus PW continues to increase, the threshold stimulus asymptotically approaches the rheobase current, meaning the power also levels off. However, due to the increased duration of power consumption to maintain the pulse, stimulator energy consumption increases in a near linear fashion (Equation 1). Between these two extremes, there exists an energy-optimal PW for stimulation. Our results from stimulating large diameter axons in rat sciatic nerve suggest an energy-optimal PW of \u223c100 \u00b5s.",
                "Our simulation results show that the relationship between energy consumption and PW may also be a function of the axon diameter. The simulations predicted that large diameter axons (>10 \u00b5m), like those seen in SCS and peripheral motor stimulation, have their most efficient PW at \u223c200 \u00b5s. This prediction is longer than our experimental results (\u223c100 \u00b5s) and our theoretical recruitment estimates (\u223c3 nJ) were smaller than found experimentally (\u223c15 nJ). These discrepancies likely arise from the simplistic nature of the electrode-tissue interface model and volume conductor electric field model used in our computer simulation.",
                "In spite of the model limitations, the simulations do provide some insight into application of energy optimal PWs to other stimulation applications, such as DBS. Compared to peripheral nerve stimulation, stimulation targets in the central nervous system typically have axons with much smaller diameters. Based on our models, we predict that DBS would be most efficient at longer PWs [7]. This is in contrast to the current paradigm for DBS, where shorter PWs are favored (60\u201390 \u00b5s) to minimize charge injection by voltage-controlled stimulators, and therefore energy consumption. However, if variable compliance current-controlled stimulators were available, longer PWs would decrease the voltage requirement of stimulation, with a net reduction in energy consumption. For example, we predict potential energy savings of \u223c63%, from 132 nJ (rectangular, 60 \u00b5s) to 48 nJ (centered-triangle, 550 \u00b5s), with the combination of variable-compliance and an energy-optimal stimulus waveform to activate 50% of the small diameter fibers in our simple model (Figure 6). However, energy savings with energy-optimal PWs can only be achieved by adjusting the compliance voltage to real-time requirements.",
                "Energy consumption by the stimulator circuit is affected by the dynamics of the transistor and the capacitance of the electrode-tissue interface. The minimum drain-source voltage required to maintain operation of the FET in the saturation region increased with the current regulated by the FET (Figure 3a). This would also be true with a bipolar junction transistor; increasing the required drain-source voltage results in power loss. This type of energy loss could potentially be mitigated by feedback control of the gate voltage and optimization of the FET dynamics. Energy consumption was further impacted by the capacitance of the electrode-tissue interface. As current was delivered by the partially capacitive stimulating electrode, voltage built up across the electrode-tissue interface which generated a nearly linear rise in Vload during constant current delivery (e.g. Figure 3c). This resulted in increased energy consumption, especially at long PWs, compared to an ideal, purely resistive impedance (as calculated using Istim2). Platinum electrodes were used in this experiment, a material that is commonly used for clinical applications such as DBS and SCS. However, materials that are less polarizable (e.g. iridium-oxide) would exhibit smaller voltage build-up during stimulation, augmenting the potential energy savings of stimulation with long PWs and an adjustable compliance voltage.",
                "It will be important to ensure that stimulation is being delivered safely to the target tissue since use of a more efficient PW and waveform may result in more charge injected than a standard rectangular waveform and short PW (Figure 4a,d,e). The safety of a given stimulation therapy is ultimately demonstrated by application-specific chronic animal testing, however, general guidelines for charge injection limits have been established [10], [20]. The safe charge density limit will also depend on the material of the electrode. For example, most commercial stimulators use platinum/iridium electrodes and limit charge density to 50 \u00b5C/cm2. Alternative electrode materials such as iridium-oxide or titanium-nitride have also been used commercially, and may provide for higher charge density limits [21]. Most commercial SCS and DBS electrodes are platinum/iridium and have a surface area of 6\u20138 mm2, resulting in a charge injection limit of 3\u20134 \u00b5C. These limits will need to be respected in the development of a neurostimulator that uses the techniques described in this manuscript.",
                "The findings from this study are most relevant for standard commercial electrode technologies in which a significant fraction of the electrode voltage drop occurs across the tissue. It is likely that less energy savings would be seen for very small electrodes (e.g. microelectrodes) since substantial voltage is dropped across the high electrode interface impedance (low capacitance). However, this limitation could be mitigated in part by using high performance electrode materials, as described above.",
                "This study demonstrates that coupling circuit design with understanding of neurostimulation biophysics has potential to enable significant improvements in electrical stimulation energy efficiency. Our results may be useful in helping to design future IPGs. We predict that a combination of centered-triangular waveform shape, axon diameter optimized pulse-width, and variable compliance current-controlled pulse generators will result in measureable improvement in neuromodulation IPG battery life."
