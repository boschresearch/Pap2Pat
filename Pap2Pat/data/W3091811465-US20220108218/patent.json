However, NISQ devices can often be noisy in that the error rate for results of and operation can be relatively high. In some instances, NISQ devices may be too noisy for many algorithms having a known quantum advantage, and therefore the utility of such noisy NISQ devices is significantly diminished.

Indeed, the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as being limiting as to the scope, applicability, or configuration of the present disclosure.

                        "As used herein the term \u201cor\u201d is used as the logical or where any one or more of the operands being true results in the statement being true. As used herein, the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d as used in, for example, \u201cA is based on B\u201d indicates that B is a factor that determines A, but B is not necessarily the only factor that determines A.",
                        "According to some example embodiments, methods, apparatuses, and systems are provided herein that are related to various example implementations of quantum-assisted machine learning leveraging tensor networks (TNs). A tensor network may be a type or class of variational wave functions that can be used to study and model, for example, many-body quantum systems. In this regard, according to some example embodiments, methods for quantum-assisted machine learning may be implemented using TNs and a statistical model based on a classical data set. Such techniques may further employ optimizations that may be particularly useful in the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, thereby increasing the utility of such devices. Additionally, some example methods may utilize an embedding or encoding map to transform a classical data set into quantum states and then apply to optimization methodologies to train a TN model on a classical device. The TN model may define a formal sequential preparation scheme to deploy on a gate-based quantum device or computer in the form of a quantum circuit and an associated quantum program.",
                        "According to some example embodiments, the example methods may use remaining ambiguity in the TN model to make the model more amenable to compilation on a quantum device. In this regard, heuristics may be used for translating the TN model into an abstract quantum circuit for a quantum device with known noise, gate set, and hardware topology constraints. The abstract circuit model can be deployed on, for example, quantum hardware devices including cloud-based quantum hardware. Measurements from the quantum device implementing the abstract circuit model may define data samples that can be analyzed to assess model performance. In this regard, the example methods may therefore produce quantum programs or circuits, which may be analogous to programs in classical assembly language, that can be, for example, a factor of ten shorter in operations than quantum programs produced using conventional methods. Also, NISQ devices can have error rates of approximately 1% or more, and therefore, a reduction in quantum program size (e.g., number of commands) can result in an vast improvement in error rate since each command may contribute to the chances of an error occurring. As such, the usability of such NISQ devices can be increased since the risk of errors can be substantially reduced.",
                        "As such, according to some example embodiments, example methods may include converting from a representation of a tensor network machine learning model into a collection of instructions to be performed on a quantum device. The model may be specified as a collection of isometric matrices, obtained as the result of an optimization procedure with finite stopping tolerance, that can be translated into a set of allowed quantum operations on a quantum device with a fixed layout and noise characteristics. In contrast to most quantum computing use cases in which the operations to be performed require fine-tuning to produce useful outcomes, the statistical nature of the model may introduce \u201ctolerance\u201d or \u201cslackness\u201d that can reduce fidelity constraints for the quantum operations. As such, ambiguity in the parameters of the model and the \u201cslackness\u201d property may be leveraged to optimize deployment on quantum resources without sacrificing utility of the model outcomes. According to some example embodiments, example methods may differ from conventional approaches for compilation of quantum operations and can produce significantly shorter quantum programs without sacrificing output quality for implementation on, for example, noisy quantum computing hardware.",
                        "The example methods and apparatuses performing the methods, may find applicability in a vast number of contexts. For example, example methods may be employed by commercial-quantum hardware providers for use in developing application programming interfaces (APIs) for quantum devices. Further, the example methods as described herein may be applied in quantum-assisted machine learning contexts and applications of a wide variety.",
                        "As such, according to some example embodiments, quantum-assisted machine learning (QAML) on, for example, NISQ devices may be implemented by leveraging the use of TNs, which can offer a robust platform for designing resource-efficient and expressive machine learning models to be dispatched on quantum devices. In particular, according to some example embodiments, an example framework and variations thereof are provided herein for designing and optimizing TN-based QAML models using classical techniques, and then compiling the TN-based QAML models to be run on quantum hardware, which can be demonstrated for generative matrix product state (MPS) models. As such, a generalized canonical form for MPS models is provided that aids in compilation to quantum devices. Further, greedy heuristics may be used for compiling with a given topology and gate set that may outperform known generic methods in terms of a number of entangling gates, e.g., CNOTs (controlled NOT gates), in some cases by an order of magnitude. A solvable (or exactly solvable) benchmark problem may also be used for assessing the performance of the MPS QAML models according to various example embodiments. The impacts of hardware topology and day-to-day experimental noise fluctuations on model performance can be considered by analyzing both raw experimental counts and statistical divergences of inferred distributions. Additionally, parametric studies of depolarization and readout noise impacts on model performance using hardware simulators can also be considered.",
                        "Gate-based quantum computing has emerged as a relatively mature technology, with many platforms offering cloud-based interfaces to machines with a few to dozens of qubits, as well as classical emulators of quantum devices. The quantum computing resources, however, can, in some instances, be limited in the number of qubits despite, for example, millions of qubits being required to perform certain canonical quantum computing tasks such as integer factorization with error correction. Further, some quantum computing resources may be either engineered with a specific demonstration goal or designed for general-purpose research-scale exploration. However, in the context of noisy NISQ devices, whose hardware noise and limited qubit connectivity and gate sets can pose challenges for demonstrating scalable universal quantum computation, a different form of quantum application discovery may be considered in which algorithms may be required to be robust to noise, limited qubit connectivity and gate sets, and highly resource-efficient.",
                        "Such NISQ devices may be leveraged in the context of machine learning (ML) because well-performing ML algorithms can feature robustness against noise. Additionally, quantum circuits can be designed for ML applications that are highly qubit-efficient, and quantum models can be designed whose expressibility increases exponentially with qubit depth. In this regard, one ML application, for example, may involve implementation of NISQ devices in the context of quantum-assisted machine learning, in which a quantum circuit's parameters are classically optimized based on measurement outcomes that may not be efficiently classically simulable, which may also include kernel-based learning schemes with a quantum kernel. According to some example embodiments, TNs can provide a robust means of designing such parameterized quantum circuits that are quantum-resource efficient and can be implemented and optimized on classical or quantum hardware. TN-based QAML algorithms, according to some example embodiments, can leverage optimization strategies for TNs, and also enable detailed benchmarking and design of QAML models classically, with a smooth transition to classically intractable models.",
                        "The applicability of QAML with TN architectures on NISQ hardware and hardware simulators is described according to some example embodiments. Further, hardware noise, qubit connectivity, and restrictions on gate sets may also be considered. Fully generative unsupervised learning tasks may be considered for QAML with, for example, the most resource-efficient matrix product state (MPS) TN topology. A framework is provided for QAML, according to some example embodiments, that includes translation of classical data into quantum states, optimization of an MPS model using classical techniques, the conversion of this trained model into a sequence of isometric operations to be performed on quantum resources, and the optimization and compilation of these isometric operations into native operations for a given hardware topology and allowed gate set. In this regard, according to some example embodiments, the framework may involve QAML with TNs in association with embedding classical data into quantum states, classical training of a TN model, and the conversion of TN models into resource-efficient sequential preparation schemes. Further, techniques, according to some example embodiments, are provided for the compilation stage aimed at TN models for QAML on devices including NISQ devices. Such techniques may include the permutation of auxiliary quantum degrees of freedom in the TN to optimize mapping to hardware resources and heuristics for the translation of isometries into native operations minimizing or using as few entangling operations (e.g., CNOTs) as possible. In this regard, the framework may further involve compiling TN-based QAML models for running on quantum hardware, including the utilization of ambiguity in the TN representation and greedy compilation heuristics for minimizing model gate depth. According to some example embodiments, the example methods described herein may enable the robust design and performance assessment of QAML models on NISQ devices in the regime where classical simulations are possible, and may also inform architectures and noise levels for scaling to the classically intractable regime. Even in the classically intractable regime in which the model can be optimized using a quantum device in a hybrid quantum/classical loop, the example methods may provide a means of obtaining an approximate, classically trained \u201cpreconditioner\u201d for the quantum models that can help avoid local minima and reduce optimization time. Further, results can be provided, according to some example embodiments, for synthetic data that can be described by, for example, an exactly solvable two-qubit MPS QAML model.",
                        "With respect to QAML with TN, FIG. 1 provides an example method 100 for a QAML workflow according to some example embodiments. In short, at 102, classical data may be received or otherwise obtained, and, at 104, quantum embedding or encoding may be performed where the classical data may be pre-processed and transformed to quantum states embedded, for example, in an exponentially large Hilbert space. At 106, a TN optimization may be performed where a TN model may be learned from a collection of quantum training data. At 108, the TN model may be interpreted using a sequential preparation scheme involving a number (e.g., a small number) of readout qubits coupled to ancillary resources. At 110, isometries of the sequential preparation scheme may be conditioned using inherent freedom in the TN model representation and converted (or compiled) into native gates for a target hardware architecture (e.g., a processor such as the IBMQ-X2 processor). At 112, the native gates or a variation thereof may be executed on hardware, such as, for example, cloud-based hardware and measurements defining output predictions may be obtained at 114.",
                        "Having provided a general overview of the example method 100, a more detailed description of the operations of example method 100 will now be provided. In this regard, a collection of classical data vectors in a training set ={xj}j=1Nmay be received at 102, where each element xj is an N-length vector. The classical data vectors may therefore be mapped to vectors in, for example, a quantum Hilbert space to be quantum embedded or encoded at 104. According to some example embodiments, a restriction that may be placed on the encoding of classical data in quantum states may be that each classical data vector can be encoded in an unentangled product state, which may be beneficial for at least the following reasons. For one, unentangled states can be the simplest to prepare experimentally with high fidelity, and also enable the use qubit-efficient sequential preparation schemes. From a learning perspective, encoding individual data vectors in product states may also ensure that any entanglement that results in a quantum model may be a result of correlations in an ensemble of data and not from a priori assumptions about pre-existing correlations for individual data vectors. For encoding of an N-dimensional classical data vector x into an ensemble of N qubits, a convenient parameterization may be",

Here, the quantum model may be defined as a collection of operations applied to quantum resources to produce states that encodes the properties of the ensemble {|\u03a6(xj)}. Specializing to the use of TN models in this context can provide a convenient parameterization of the structure of quantum operations and resources. The TNs may, according to some example embodiments, represent the high-rank tensor by describing a quantum wavefunction in a specified basis as a contraction over low-rank tensors, and may therefore define families of low-rank approximations whose computational power can be expressed in terms of the maximum dimension of any contracted index X, known as the bond dimension.",
                        "According to some example embodiments, a wide variety of TN topologies can be considered which may be able to efficiently capture certain classes of quantum states. One example may be matrix product states (MPSs). MPSs may use a one-dimensional TN topology, as shown using the Penrose graphical notation 105 in FIG. 1 for tensors, and form the basis for the density matrix renormalization group (DRAG) algorithm in quantum condensed matter physics. MPSs have several properties that may be attractive for QAML. For one, MPSs are well-understood and mature for tensor networks, therefore allowing for robust optimization strategies used in quantum many-body community applications. In addition, MPSs can be highly quantum resource efficient, in that an associated wavefunction can be sequentially prepared, and therefore qubits can be reused in deployment on quantum hardware. As such, according to some example embodiments, every state that can be sequentially prepared may be written as an MPS.",
                        "TNs can also be applied outside of the condensed matter and quantum information domains. For example, TN methods may be used for data analysis, e.g., large-scale principal component analyses where MPSs may be referred to as tensor trains. Further, TN methods may be used to design quantum-inspired ML models based on a scheme using an MPS network as a linear classifier in a Hilbert space whose dimension is exponentially large in the length of the raw data vector. Quantum-assisted or quantum-inspired TN ML models may be used in generative modeling of binary data using MPSs. In some TN approaches, DMRG-inspired algorithms for optimization may be employed. Additionally, TNs may be implemented as a neural network using deep learning software, and the tensors of the TN may be optimized using backpropagation strategies in classical ML, but such approach, in some instances, has been suboptimal with respect to a DMRG-like approach.",
                        "Following from application of TNs in these contexts, example embodiments can leverage the fact that MPSs may be used to define a sequential preparation scheme as a highly resource efficient scheme for learning and quantum simulation. In this regard, the qubit resource requirements for an MPS model may be logarithmic in the bond dimension \u03c7, which may encapsulate the expressivity of the model, and the qubit resource requirements may be independent of the length of the input data vector N. To illustrate this property, a register of N qubits may be considered with states |ji, i=0, . . . , N\u22121, ji=0,1 in which data may be encoded and an \u03c7-level ancilla |\u03b1, \u03b1=0, . . . , \u03c7\u22121 that can be used to entangle the qubits.

Further, since the ancilla degrees of freedom may not be directly measured in some example embodiments, there may be no preferred basis or state ordering for these states. Both of these properties can give freedom that may be utilized to simplify compilation. In addition, the isometries may be the result of an optimization procedure that has a finite tolerance, as described above, and therefore do not need to be compiled exactly to meet a fine-tuned property. In other words, model predictions may not be more accurate when using a compiled unitary that matches the isometry better than the optimization tolerance. For implementation on NISQ devices, in particular, fine tuning of isometry properties through the introduction of additional entangling gates may produce, in some instances, diminished results due to the increased noise in the circuit compared to a shallower representation.

More specifically, FIG. 3 shows example isometries for operations with \u03c7=7 dimensional ancilla before, i.e., plot 300, and after, i.e., plot 310 applying the diagonal gauge transformation Eq.

Since the sequential MPS preparation scheme may require that the ancilla start and end in the vacuum state, this may occur for tensors near the extremal values of the representation when an ancilla qubit is first utilized or an ancilla qubit is decoupled from the remaining qubits. In such cases, an alternate procedure may be employed to decide between permutations. First, all basis permutations may be enumerated resulting from these ambiguities for a given tensor [i],jand associated isometries L\u030a(\u03b6) may be constructed, in which \u03b6 indexes permutations. To select a permutation, this operator may be conditioned to be as \u201cdiagonal\u201d as possible, in the sense of minimizing the number of qubit operations being applied. A simple cost function, according to some example embodiments, may be constructed as follows: for each state indexed by the ancilla state \u03b1 and the physical qubit q as above, convert the state index into its binary representation b, which effectively maps the ancilla state onto a collection of log2\u03c7 qubits.

As such, the diagonal gauge may merely use the unitary freedom remaining in the left-canonical form to further optimize the state preparation procedure while maintaining sparsity. A single tensor may exist that is not optimized at a certain location k in the transformation to the diagonal gauge that may be referred to as the diagonality center, which may be analogous to the orthogonality center of mixed canonical form. While the location of the diagonality center can again be used as an optimization parameter, the diagonality center may be set to an isometry that is initially an identity matrix. Such an isometry may, according to some example embodiments, be introduced, if necessary, by padding the classical data vectors with a zero at location k.

The optimization procedure may proceed by optimizing a root node (single-qubit gates) over parameters of the root node and checking the cost function, for example, against a threshold, to determine if an acceptable gate is found. If no acceptable gate is found, a queue of gates corresponding to adding an entangling gate and a pair of single-qubit gates to the root node in all allowed locations as described above may be formed.

The x axis denotes consecutive experimental days, and the horizontal points for each day indicate the KL divergence resulting from the distributions averaged over all days. Clearly, the application of the measurement noise filter improves the estimation of probabilities, as indicated by a lower KL divergence with respect to the ideal results. In addition, the auto-compiled circuits (squares) show a lower KL divergence than the hand-compiled circuits (circles), likely due to their shallower circuits. Finally, it is shown that the Vigo results in in chart 1210 have lower KL divergence than the IBMQ-X2 results in in chart 1200, indicating an overall lower noise level for these days, in spite of the day-to-day fluctuations in the KL divergence, being comparable in magnitude between the two machines.",
                        "According to the example methods and workflows described herein, classical data may be encoded into quantum states using an embedding map, the ensemble of quantum states may then be learned or trained as a TN machine, such as a TM Born machine, using a classical DMRG-like procedure with, for example, gradient descent of the negative log-likelihood, and the model may be compiled into operations for target quantum hardware to obtain data samples as measurement outcomes. Using MPS-based models may enable the use of highly quantum resource-efficient sequential preparation schemes requiring (1) qubits for a classical data vector length N and (log \u03c7) qubits for bond dimension \u03c7, which may encapsulate the model expressivity. Additionally, several optimizations may be implemented in the compilation stage of the workflow, such as the introduction of the diagonal gauge of the MPS model that utilizes inherent freedom in the model representation to reduce the complexity of the compiled model, as well as greedy heuristics for finding shallow gate sequences matching a target isometry to a specified tolerance given hardware topology and allowed gate constraints. An exactly solvable benchmark model can also be employed requiring two qubits and the performance of the model can be assessed, as provided herein, on, for example, quantum hardware. The results of implementation of the example QAML procedures described herein may be leveraged in a number of contexts including designing and analyzing TN-inspired model structures for scaling towards the classically intractable regime, and serving as \u201cpreconditioners\u201d where a model trained using optimal classical strategies may be augmented with additional quantum resources and then trained directly on the quantum device or in a hybrid quantum/classical optimization loop, potentially avoiding local minima and speeding up optimization times.",
