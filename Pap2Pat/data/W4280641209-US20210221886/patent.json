    "date": "2020-12-04 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present disclosure provides compositions and methods comprising a first antibody comprising a fully human anti-CD47 antibody and a second antibody comprising an Fc portion that binds an Fc\u03b3 receptor on an effector cell. In various embodiments the anti-CD47 antibody used in the methods and compositions exhibits a low level of binding to red blood cells and does not induce hemagglutination even at high concentrations of antibody. In some embodiments, the second antibody comprises a tumor-targeting antibody including an antibody that binds CD20, PD-L1, CD38 or SLAMF7 antigens. The combination of the fully human anti-CD47 antibody and the second antibody can decrease cancer burden in a subject.",

                        "CD47 is a cell surface antigen overexpressed on many tumor cells. CD47 can inhibit phagocytosis by innate immune cells such as macrophages by engaging its receptor, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1), on the surface of the immune cells. (Because it inhibits phagocytosis, CD47 is sometimes referred to as the \u201cdon't eat me\u201d molecule.) Administration of anti-CD47 antibodies can relieve the inhibition of the native immune system by blocking the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction and thus provides an anticancer strategy.",
                        "In addition to being overexpressed on many tumor cells, CD47 is also expressed on some normal cells, including platelets and erythrocytes. Treatment of patients with anti-CD47 antibodies therefore can result in toxic effects to the patient resulting from normal blood cell binding. For example, the Phase I trial of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody Hu5F9 (magrolimab) resulted in 57% of the treated patients experiencing transient anemia and 36% exhibiting hemagglutination of peripheral blood cells (Sikic et al. (2019) J. Clinical Oncol. 37:946-953)."

                                "An \u201cantigen-binding protein\u201d and related terms used herein refer to a protein comprising a portion that binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding portion to adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen-binding protein to the antigen. Examples of antigen-binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., an antigen binding portion of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. As used herein an \u201cantigen-binding protein derived from [a referenced] antibody\u201d is an antigen-binding protein that includes the variable light chain sequence and variable heavy chain sequence of the referenced antibody. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, for example, Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, Volume 53, Issue 1:121-129; Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654.

                                "An antigen binding protein can have, in some examples, the structure of an immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, an \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d refers to a tetrameric molecule composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa or lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \u201cJ\u201d region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \u201cD\u201d region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The heavy and/or light chains may or may not include a leader sequence for secretion. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites. In one embodiment, an antigen binding protein can be a synthetic molecule having a structure that differs from a tetrameric immunoglobulin molecule but still binds a target antigen or binds two or more target antigens. For example, a synthetic antigen binding protein can comprise antibody fragments, 1-6 or more polypeptide chains, asymmetrical assemblies of polypeptides, or other synthetic molecules.",

An antigen binding protein may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest.",

Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. Monoclonal antibodies include monoclonal antibodies produced using hybridoma methods that provide a cell line producing a population of identical antibody molecules, and also include chimeric, hybrid, and recombinant antibodies produced by cloning methods such that a cell transfected with the construct or constructs that include the antibody-encoding sequences and the progeny of the transfected cell produce a population of antibody molecules directed against a single antigenic site. For example, variable regions of an antibody (variable heavy chain and light chain regions or variable heavy and light chain CDRs) may be cloned into an antibody framework that includes constant regions of any species, including human constant regions, where expression of the construct in a cell can produce a single antibody molecule or antigen-binding protein that is referred to herein as monoclonal.",

In one embodiment, the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-26 and Huston et al., 1988, Proc.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48, and Poljak et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-23). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites. Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different. Diabody, tribody and tetrabody constructs can be prepared using antigen binding portions from any of the anti-CD47 antibodies described herein.",

For example, the constant regions of a humanized antibody may be human constant region sequences, where the amino acid sequence of a variable domains may be from an antibody sequence of another species, such as a mouse (in which the antibody may have been generated). A humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In some embodiments, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In some embodiments, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody is changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293.",

A fully human antibody as disclosed herein may have one or more mutations (which may be, for example amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions) in the constant regions, such as for example the Fc constant regions of the heavy chain, with respect to a wild type human antibody sequence. For example, a fully human antibody can have one or more mutation in the constant regions of either the light or heavy chain of the antibody, where the sequence of either or both of the light chain constant region or heavy chain constant regions (CH1, CH2, and CH3) of the fully human antibody are greater than 95%, greater than 96%, greater than 97%, and preferably greater than 98% or at least 99% identical to the sequence of the non-mutant human constant regions. Humanized and fully human antibodies may be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are described below, including through recombinant methodologies or through immunization with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is genetically modified to express antibodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain-encoding genes, e.g., the \u201cXenomouse II\u201d that, when challenged with an antigen, generates high affinity fully human antibodies Mendez et al. ((1997) Nature Genetics 15: 146-156). This was achieved by germ-line integration of megabase human heavy chain and light chain loci into mice with deletion of the endogenous JH region. The antibodies produced in these mice closely resemble that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire.",
                                "Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., Nature 348, 552-553 [1990]) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from immunized or nonimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3, 564-571 (1993). Any of a number of sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display, e.g., the spleens of immunized mice (Clackson et al., Nature 352, 624-628 (1991)) or blood cells of nonimmunized human donors can be used to generate antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., J.

In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human antibody are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first human antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third antibody. In another example, the CDRs originate from different species such as human and mouse, or human and rabbit, or human and goat.

The Fc region comprises at least a portion of the CH2 and CH3 regions and may, or may not, include a portion of the hinge region. An Fc domain can bind Fc cell surface receptors and some proteins of the immune complement system. An Fc region can bind a complement component C1q. An Fc domain exhibits effector function, including any one or any combination of two or more activities including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), opsonization and/or cell binding.

The percent identity between two polypeptide sequences is a function of the number of identical amino acids at aligned positions that are shared between the two polypeptide sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which may need to be introduced to optimize alignment of the two polypeptide sequences. In a similar manner, the percent identity between two polynucleotide sequences is a function of the number of identical nucleotides at aligned positions that are shared between the two polynucleotide sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which may need to be introduced to optimize alignment of the two polynucleotide sequences. A comparison of the sequences and determination of the percent identity between two polypeptide sequences, or between two polynucleotide sequences, may be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the \u201cpercent identity\u201d or \u201cpercent homology\u201d of two polypeptide or two polynucleotide sequences may be determined by comparing the sequences using the GAP computer program (a part of the GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.)) using its default parameters. Expressions such as \u201ccomprises a sequence with at least X% identity to Y\u201d with respect to a test sequence mean that, when aligned to sequence Y as described above, the test sequence comprises residues identical to at least X% of the residues of Y.",
                                "In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence of a test antibody may be similar but not necessarily identical to any of the amino acid sequences of the polypeptides that make up any of the anti-CD47 antibodies described herein. The similarities between the test antibody and the polypeptides can be at least 95%, or at or at least 96% identical, or at least 97% identical, or at least 98% identical, or at least 99% identical, to any of the polypeptides that make up any of the anti-CD47 antibodies, or antigen binding protein thereof, described herein. In one embodiment, similar polypeptides can contain amino acid substitutions within a heavy and/or light chain. In one embodiment, the amino acid substitutions comprise one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include (1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; (2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; (3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; (4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and (7) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and methionine.",
                                "A \u201cvector\u201d and related terms used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., DNA or RNA) which can be operably linked to foreign genetic material (e.g., nucleic acid transgene). Vectors can be used as a vehicle to introduce foreign genetic material into a cell (e.g., host cell). Vectors can include at least one restriction endonuclease recognition sequence for insertion of the transgene into the vector. Vectors can include at least one gene sequence that confers antibiotic resistance or a selectable characteristic to aid in selection of host cells that harbor a vector-transgene construct. Expression vectors can include one or more origin of replication sequences. Vectors can be single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid molecules. Vectors can be linear or circular nucleic acid molecules. One type of vector is a \u201cplasmid,\u201d which refers to a linear or circular double stranded extrachromosomal DNA molecule which can be linked to a transgene, and is capable of replicating in a host cell, and transcribing and/or translating the transgene. A viral vector typically contains viral RNA or DNA backbone sequences which can be linked to the transgene. The viral backbone sequences can be modified to disable infection but retain insertion of the viral backbone and the co-linked transgene into a host cell genome. Examples of viral vectors include retroviral, lentiviral, adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, baculoviral, papovaviral, vaccinia viral, herpes simplex viral and Epstein Barr viral vectors. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome.",
                                "An \u201cexpression vector\u201d is a type of vector that can contain one or more regulatory sequences, such as inducible and/or constitutive promoters and enhancers. Expression vectors can include ribosomal binding sites and/or polyadenylation sites. Expression vectors can include one or more origin of replication sequences. Regulatory sequences direct transcription, or transcription and translation, of a transgene linked to or inserted into the expression vector which is transduced into a host cell. The regulatory sequence(s) can control the level, timing and/or location of expression of the transgene. The regulatory sequence can, for example, exert its effects directly on the transgene, or through the action of one or more other molecules (e.g., polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence and/or the nucleic acid). Regulatory sequences can be part of a vector. Further examples of regulatory sequences are described in, for example, Goeddel, 1990, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif and Baron et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3605-3606.",

A host cell also can be a cell that comprises the nucleic acid but does not express it at a desired level unless a regulatory sequence is introduced into the host cell such that it becomes operably linked with the nucleic acid. It is understood that the term host cell refers not only to the particular subject cell but also to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell.

The foreign nucleic acids can include an expression vector operably linked to a transgene, and the host cell can be used to express the nucleic acid and/or polypeptide encoded by the foreign nucleic acid (transgene). A host cell (or a population thereof) can be a cultured cell, can be extracted from a subject, or can be the cell of an organism, including a human subject. The host cell (or a population of host cells) includes the primary subject cell and its progeny without any regard for the number of generations or passages.

As a result, the modified polypeptides may contain non-amino acid elements, such as lipids, poly- or mono-saccharide, and phosphates. In one embodiment, a form of glycosylation can be sialylation, which conjugates one or more sialic acid moieties to the polypeptide.

In one embodiment, the PEG terminates on one end with hydroxy or methoxy, i.e., X is H or CH3 (\u201cmethoxy PEG\u201d). A PEG can contain further chemical groups which are necessary for binding reactions; which results from the chemical synthesis of the molecule; or which is a spacer for optimal distance of parts of the molecule. In addition, such a PEG can consist of one or more PEG side-chains which are linked together. PEGs with more than one PEG chain are called multiarmed or branched PEGs. Branched PEGs can be prepared, for example, by the addition of polyethylene oxide to various polyols, including glycerol, pentaerythriol, and sorbitol. Branched PEG molecules are described in, for example, EP-A 0 473 084 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,462. One form of PEGs includes two PEG side-chains (PEG2) linked via the primary amino groups of a lysine (Monfardini et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 6 (1995) 62-69)."
