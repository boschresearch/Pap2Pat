    "title": "A Novel Affinity Engineered Anti-CD47 Antibody With Improved Therapeutic Index That Preserves Erythrocytes and Normal Immune Cells",
    "date": "2022-05-19",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic blockade of the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis by small molecules or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy to enhance macrophages-mediated anti-tumor activity. However, this strategy has been hampered by elevated on-target toxicities and rapid clearance due to the extensive CD47 expression on normal cells (antigen sink) such as red blood cells (RBCs). To address these hurdles, we report on the development of STI-6643, an affinity-engineered fully human anti-CD47 IgG4 antibody with negligible binding to normal cells. STI-6643 exhibited no hemagglutination activity on human RBCs at concentrations up to 300 \u00b5g/mL yet specifically blocked the CD47/SIPR\u03b1 interaction. Of particular interest, STI-6643 preserved T cell functionality in vitro and showed significantly lower immune cell depletion in vivo in contrast to three previously published competitor reference anti-CD47 clones Hu5F9, AO-176 and 13H3. In cynomolgus monkeys, STI-6643 was well-tolerated at the highest dose tested (300 mg/kg/week) and provided favorable clinical safety margins. Finally, STI-6643 displayed comparable anti-tumor activity to the high-affinity reference clone Hu5F9 in a RAJI-Fluc xenograft tumor model as monotherapy or in combination with anti-CD20 (rituximab) or anti-CD38 (daratumumab) mAbs. These data suggest that STI-6643 possesses the characteristics of an effective therapeutic candidate given its potent anti-tumor activity and low toxicity profile.",

                "Development of cancer confers several advantages to tumor cells over normal cells leading to their uncontrolled proliferation and evasion of apoptosis and phagocytosis. Several molecules involved in these escape mechanisms have been identified and targeted by cancer treatments (1). Less clear is the role of molecules associated with phagocytosis (2). Two immunoglobin family members CD31 and CD47 have been identified as the inhibitors of phagocytosis (2, 3). CD31 surface expression is detected on platelets, on most leukocytes, and is constitutively present on endothelial linings in vivo (4). CD47, on the other hand, is ubiquitously expressed and functions as a regulator of phagocytosis by interacting with its high-affinity ligand, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) (5) expressed on innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neuronal cells (5\u20138). CD47 binding to SIRP\u03b1 delivers an inhibitory \u201cdo not eat me\u201d signal preventing phagocytic removal of healthy cells by the immune system (9\u201311). Therefore, CD47 represents an important inhibitory checkpoint preventing phagocytosis of healthy cells (9, 11, 12) and unwanted autoimmune attacks (13).",
                "However, many cancer cells hijack this molecular pathway by expressing elevated levels of cell surface CD47 to avoid elimination by phagocytic immune cells. High CD47 expression is associated with poor clinical prognosis (9, 12, 14). Based on these observations, CD47 has become a prominent target in the field of cancer immunotherapy (5, 15\u201317). Consequently, a series of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction are being evaluated clinically (18).",
                "High CD47 expression on normal cells among which RBCs, platelets and lymphocytes express elevated levels of CD47 led to significant toxicities (mainly thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia) in the clinical trials with anti-CD47 mAb Hu5F9-G4 (18), which were mitigated by injecting patients with a low-priming mAb dose to occupy the RBC sink and induce compensatory erythropoiesis (19, 20). Recent studies have also described elevated CD47 levels in tissue-infiltrating NK cells and CD8+ T cells in esophageal carcinoma patients (21), but the impact of anti-CD47 treatments on lymphocyte and particularly effector T cells in patients has not been extensively documented. Although lymphopenia was observed in peripheral blood of approximately 35% Hu5F9-G4-treated patients (20) it remains unclear whether CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells are impacted by prolonged anti-CD47 treatments. This question remains crucial considering the importance of CD8+ T cells in boosting and maintaining anti-tumor responses upon anti-CD47 therapy as observed in preclinical animal models (19, 22\u201324). Thus, designing next generation CD47/SIRP\u03b1 blocking antibodies with an improved safety profile and greater therapeutic window are needed.",
                "Here, we describe the preclinical development of a fully human IgG4-S228P anti-CD47 antibody, named STI-6643 with clinically favorable properties. STI-6643 has been affinity-engineered to maintain the \u2018on-target/on-tumor\u2019 activity but reduce the \u2018on-target/off-tumor\u2019 binding to CD47. Consequently, STI-6643 displayed potent anti-tumor activity with negligible RBC and lymphocyte toxicities and was well-tolerated at doses up to 300 mg/kg in monkeys without the necessity of a priming dose. STI-6643 showed increased macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-PD-L1, anti-CD20 or anti-CD38 mAbs. As such, one can envision use of STI-6643 in combination with tumor cell-specific opsonizing or lymphocytes-targeting immune-modulators for improved efficacy. Hence, STI-6643 possesses biophysical and functional properties to potentially become an important antibody in the field of CD47/SIRP\u03b1-axis blocking therapeutic agents and is set for clinical trials."

                        "Purified STI-6643 cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) mAb was obtained as outlined in the Materials and Methods section. Anti-CD47 clone STI-6643 was affinity-engineered to exhibit reduced binding affinity towards its target with the hypothesis that avidity rather than affinity would drive target engagement and thus it would lower on-target off-tumor toxicity and improve bioavailability. Figure\u00a01A shows that STI-6643 possesses a moderate binding affinity to human CD47 antigen with a KD of 76 nM. The affinity was found to be even lower against the cynomolgus monkey and canine antigens (177 and 134 nM respectively).",
                        "We used reference anti-CD47 mAb clone Hu5F9-G4 (or Hu5F9) to compare the binding of STI-6643 on two human and two canine cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure\u00a01A). STI-6643 displayed similar dose-dependent binding to MDA-MB-231 and two canine osteosarcoma cell lines (OSCA-40 and OSCA-78) with an EC50 of ~ 30.0 \u00b5g/mL whereas binding to RAJI cells was slightly better (EC50 = 6.64 \u00b5g/mL). Binding of Hu5F9 was higher than STI-6643 on human cell lines (with saturating doses as low as 0.01 \u00b5g/mL) but was similar on canine cell lines (EC50 of ~ 24.6 \u00b5g/mL).",
                        "We next assessed the functionality of STI-6643, by analyzing its ability to block the SIRP\u03b1/CD47 interaction in vitro using CD47-presenting tumor cells and recombinant human SIRP\u03b1 protein (Figure\u00a01B). STI-6643 inhibited CD47/SIRP\u03b1 binding in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 3.65 \u00b5g/mL. The blocking activity was superior with high affinity reference mAb Hu5F9 (IC50 of 0.092 \u00b5g/mL) with saturating doses seen over 0.8 \u00b5g/mL of Hu5F9 vs no saturation seen in STI-6643 up to 200 \u00b5g/mL.",
                        "Blockade of the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 pathway triggers the phagocytic activity of SIRP\u03b1-presenting macrophages towards CD47-expressing cells. Therefore, we performed a dose-response phagocytosis assay in presence of anti-CD47 mAb clones STI-6643 and Hu5F9. Both mAbs enhanced the phagocytosis of RAJI-GFP cells by CD14+-derived macrophages (Figure\u00a01C, left and middle panels, average data presented in right panel). On average, Hu5F9 was more active than STI-6643 at low concentrations (from 0.0001 to 0.01 \u00b5g/mL) but both STI-6643 and Hu5F9 clones performed similarly at higher concentrations even if Hu5F9 activity dropped at concentrations above 10 \u00b5g/mL.",

STI-6643 killing activity was evaluated on CCRF-CEM tumor cells expressing high CD47 levels. Our results indicate that positive control anti-CD47 mAb CC2C6 (25) as well as reference clone Hu5F9 induced a concentration-dependent cell death of CCRF-CEM cells, but no activity was seen by STI-6643 (Supplementary Figure\u00a01B)."

                        "Since one of the most obvious toxicities associated with CD47-targeting antibodies is the partial depletion of RBCs leading to anemia, we compared the binding ability of anti-CD47 clones STI-6643 and Hu5F9 to RBCs isolated from different species. STI-6643 showed negligible binding to human and cynomolgus RBCs as compared to the reference clone Hu5F9 (Figure\u00a02A). STI-6643 bound slightly better to canine RBCs (EC50 = 5.1 \u00b5g/mL) than human and cynomolgus RBCs (EC50 = 11.76 and 20.32 \u00b5g/mL respectively) whereas clone Hu5F9 showed reduced binding capacity to canine (EC50 = 8.22 \u00b5g/mL) versus human or cynomolgus RBCs (EC50 = 0.62 and 0.43 \u00b5g/mL respectively).",
                        "Next, we measured hemagglutination of human, cynomolgus monkey and dog RBCs in presence of STI-6643 and three reference clones (Hu5F9, AO-176 and 13H3). As shown Figures\u00a02B, C, STI-6643 did not induce hemagglutination of human or cynomolgus RBCs at concentrations up to 300 \u00b5g/mL. In stark contrast, all reference clones demonstrated hemagglutination activity in the same conditions at concentrations higher than 1.2 \u00b5g/mL while Hu5F9 hemagglutinated as low as 0.4 \u00b5g/mL (Figures\u00a02B, C). RBCs isolated from canine blood was the only species against which STI-6643 showed signs of hemagglutination (Figure\u00a02D) correlating with the increased binding to canine RBCs (Figure\u00a02A). However, despite similar binding of Hu5F9 and STI-6643 to dog RBCs, Hu5F9 hemagglutination activity was 100-fold superior (Figures\u00a02A, D).",

When estimable, individual T1/2 ranged from 29.2 to 48.7 hours after the third injection on day 15., Based on mean Cmax and AUC(0-168) values, systemic exposure to STI-6643 increased in an approximately dose proportional manner in both sexes. Accumulation of STI-6643 was not observed on day 15 when compared to the exposure on day 1.",
                        "In a follow-up study, we investigated the safety of high dose (300 mg/kg/dose) treatment (Supplementary Figure\u00a02). Even at 300 mg/kg/dose, STI-6643 was well-tolerated, RBCs counts and hemoglobin concentration were rarely found significantly reduced when compared to formulation buffer treated animals (Supplementary Figure\u00a02A). On average, the hemoglobin concentration never dropped below 10 g/dL (a hemoglobin concentration which might trigger transfusion in humans). The lymphocytes counts were never significantly different between STI-6643-treated and control groups in both males and females. No test article-related abnormalities in the clinical or physical were noted in males or females in the STI-6643 treated group (data not shown). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference of Cmax or AUC(0-168 h) between two sexes; Cmax and AUC(0-168 h) of STI-6643 increased with the dose levels but no significant accumulation of STI-6643 was observed after repeated dosing (Supplementary Figures\u00a02B, C). Based on these results, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 300 mg/kg."

Systemic tumor growth was measured by bioluminescence revealing a significant anti-tumor activity induced by anti-CD47 mAbs when compared to isotype control (Figures\u00a04A\u2013C) correlating with a prolonged survival of STI-6643 (73%) and Hu5F9 (60%) treated mice as compared to isotype (0%) treated mice (Figure\u00a04D). Both anti-CD47 mAbs clones showed similar anti-tumor activity and no statistical difference in survival rate was observed between STI-6643 and Hu5F9-treated animals. Body weights of isotype treated mice significantly dropped around day 20 due to high tumor burden (Figure\u00a04E, left panel). In contrast, most animals treated with either STI-6643 or Hu5F9 maintained healthy body weights (Figure\u00a04E, middle and right panels).",

Results indicated that at least 10 mpk thrice a week for 2 consecutive weeks was usually required to inhibit systemic tumor expansion and prolong survival when more aggressive tumor growth kinetics were observed (Supplementary Figure\u00a03). However, when tumor development was less aggressive, doses as low as 1 mpk were sufficient to produce significant anti-tumor activity (Figure\u00a05B) and survival (Figure\u00a05C)."

Hence, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the impact of anti-CD47 clones on human T, B and NK lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. First, we compared the activity of STI-6643 and reference clone Hu5F9 on T cell depletion and activation in a super antigen stimulation assay using Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Hu5F9 induces a dose-dependent reduction of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure\u00a07A, top panels) and lowered frequency of activated CD25+ T cells (bottom panels). STI-6643, on the other hand, had a minimal impact on T cell frequencies when compared to Hu5F9, with higher effects observed in the CD4+ T cell compartment. Of note, STI-6643 concentrations 1,000-fold superior to Hu5F9 were required to observe the similar activities between two clones (100 versus 0.1 \u00b5g/mL, respectively). In addition, STI-6643 had a minor impact on IFN\u03b3 secretion as compared to Hu5F9, suggesting that STI-6643 was able to preserve T cell functionality (Figure\u00a07B).",

Prior to treatment (day 10), the peripheral blood of the mice contained ~50% of CD3+ T cells of CD45+ lymphocytes (Figure\u00a08A, left panels). A skewed CD4:CD8 ratio was likely due to the PBMC donor. Interestingly, Hu5F9 treatment led to a strong (and almost complete) depletion of human T cells, directly impacting the development of GVHD (Figure\u00a08B). In contrast, STI-6643 treatment led to a modest (~50%) decrease in CD3+ T cells as compared to isotype IgG4 (Figure\u00a08A, right panels). However, STI-6643 treatment re-established a more physiological CD4:CD8 ratio of 2:1 and remained functional as indicated by their ability to induce GVHD with the same kinetics as the isotype control-treated mice (Figure\u00a08B).",

Even if none of the antibodies showed any significant anti-tumor activity in this model, treatment with competitor clones AO-176 and Hu5F9 significantly reduced the numbers of all profiled circulating and tumor infiltrating immune cells after one week of treatment as compared to STI-6643. Hu5F9-was more a potent depleter than AO-176, especially of activated T cell populations (CD25+CD4+ and CD25+CD8+).

This \u2018regain-of-function\u2019 improves the clearance of cancer cells but also leads to unwanted removal of the anti-CD47-sensitive normal cells such as erythrocytes or platelets, causing transient anemia or thrombocytopenia in treated patients (20, 26).

The ubiquitous expression of CD47 on healthy tissues is also suspected to act as an antigen sink which can directly impact the bioavailability of CD47-targeted drugs.",

STI-6643 has lower binding affinity to human CD47 than reference clones Hu5F9, AO-176 or 13H3. Our data indicate that this strategy improved the tumor selectivity by reducing the interaction with CD47 expressed on normal cells. As a result, STI-6643 did not hemagglutinate human and cynomolgus RBCs. In contrast, under identical assay conditions all three references clones agglutinated human RBCs at doses higher than 1.2 \u00b5g/mL. It was previously reported that AO-176 was not agglutinating RBCs at doses up to 1 mg/mL in vitro (8); however, the assay conditions slightly differed since PBS1X containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as buffer and the antibody was incubated for only 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. Unexpectedly, STI-6643 was found to hemagglutinate canine RBCs at intermediate to high concentrations likely due to its higher binding on canine cells (Figure\u00a02A). Since CD47 amino acid sequence between canine and human share 66% identity (79% similarity) (32), one may assume that the epitope recognized by STI-6643 on human CD47 might be distinct than canine CD47. If this hypothesis is correct, then such changes improved STI-6643 binding to canine CD47 while it negatively impacted the binding of Hu5F9 as previously reported (32). Curiously, even if both mAbs displayed similar binding profiles to canine CD47 the stronger agglutination activity of Hu5F9 on human RBCs was still conserved on canine RBCs (2-log difference between STI-6643 and Hu5F9), suggesting additional mechanisms at play.",
                "Along with its RBCs sparing property, STI-6643 also preserved human lymphocytes viability and T cell functionality in vitro in stark contrast to Hu5F9. A similar trend was observed in vivo in xenograft GVHD model. In contrast to Hu5F9, which drastically reduced circulating T cells numbers and consequently increased mouse survival by limiting GVHD, repeated STI-6643 treatments although reducing the total circulating CD3+ T cells had no impact on the GVHD development. We hypothesize that STI-6643 treatment affected na\u00efve T cells to a greater extent than CD25+ activated/effector T cells as observed in vivo (Supplementary Figure\u00a06) where the number of total CD4+ or CD8+ T cells was slightly reduced (when compared to isotype control) while CD4+CD25+ or CD8+CD25+ remained unaffected. Therefore, in GVHD model removal of na\u00efve T cells (STI-6643 scenario) would have a minimal impact on GVHD kinetics whereas depletion of total T cells including CD25+ effector T cells (Hu5F9 scenario) would significantly slow down GVHD progression.",
                "Residual STI-6643 activity seen on human T cells in mouse xenograft models was not recapitulated in toxicity studies conducted in NHP. Our data demonstrated STI-6643 was well-tolerated with minimal impact on RBCs and lymphocytes counts (including T cells) at doses up to 300 mg/kg/dose. STI-6643 had no significant on-target/off-tumor toxicities and a good PK profile without needing low-dose priming sometimes required for competitor antibodies to mitigate the anemia and reduce CD47 expression on circulating erythrocytes (19).",
                "While sparing normal cells, STI-6643 also demonstrated specific dose-response binding activity to cancer cells usually expressing higher CD47 densities at the cell surface thus promoting increased avidity. Although STI-6643 functional activities (CD47/SIRP\u03b1 blocking, phagocytosis) were found negligible at concentrations lower than 0.1 \u00b5g/mL, the antibody was as potent as Hu5F9 at concentrations above 200 \u00b5g/mL which are usually observed in circulating blood upon anti-CD47 infusions at clinically relevant doses (8, 19, 20). In vivo, STI-6643 and Hu5F9 were found equally potent when their circulating concentration was between 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL (data not shown). In clinical settings, even if complete responses (CRs) were reported in some anti-CD47 trials, CRs were mostly below 50% and only affecting a sub-population of tumor patients. These observations were the rationale for using anti-CD47 mAbs in combination with other tumor targeting agents to improve on efficacy. For instance, it has been reported that in Non-Germinal Center B-cell Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma patients, high CD47 expression correlated with reduced overall survival upon rituximab and chemotherapy treatment suggesting that CD47 co-treatment with rituximab could be beneficial in those patients (14). Indeed, this strategy was found effective both in animal models and early clinical trials (14, 15, 27, 32). Supporting these observation, we also noted that STI-6643 had enhanced in vivo anti-tumor effects when co-administered with rituximab or daratumumab in the disseminated RAJI-Fluc xenograft tumor model.",
                "Altogether, our data suggest that by engineering the binding affinity of STI-6643 we generated a mAb with a unique set of bio-properties including potent anti-tumor activities associated with negligible impact on normal lymphocytes and RBCs. These characteristics of STI-6643 should not only improve the safety profile but could concomitantly provide significant benefits for cancer patient treated with STI-6643 alone or in combination with other immune modulators."
