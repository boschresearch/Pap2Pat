                        "DNA is a complex macromolecule whose activities are influenced by its base composition and base modification, as well as helical orientation. Bacterial DNA, as well as certain synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing unmethylated CpG sequences, can induce proliferation and immunoglobulin production by murine B cells. Unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are more frequent in the genomes of bacteria and viruses than vertebrates. Studies have suggested that immune recognition of these motifs may contribute to the host's innate immune response. (Klinman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:2879, 1996; Yi et al., J. Immun. 157:5394, 1996; Liang et al., J. Clin. Invest. II 9:89, 1996; Krieg et al., Nature 374:546, 1995).",
                        "A CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) is an oligodeoxynucleotide including a CpG motif, wherein the pyrimidine ring of the cytosine is unmethylated. Three types of CpG ODNs have been identified: C-type, K-type and D-type ODNs. Generally, CpG ODNs range from about 8 to 30 bases in size. D- and K-type nucleic acid sequences have been described in the published PCT Publication No. WO 98/18810A1 (K-type) and published PCT Publication No. WO 00/61151 (D-type). Generally D ODNs can stimulate a cellular immune response, while K ODNs can stimulate a humoral immune response.",
                        "Unmethylated CpG motifs, including both D-type ODNs and K-type ODNs, are recognized by the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) expressed on immune cells (such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells). The CpG DNA is taken up by an endocytic/phagocytic pathway. It is known that the interaction of CpG ODN with TLR9 triggers recruitment of a MyD88 adaptor molecule, activation of an IL-1R kinase-1 and other factors, resulting in the production of cytokines (see Latz et al., Nat. Immunol. 5:190-8, 2004).",
                        "CpG ODNs can be used to induce an immune response. Thus, they have been found to have many uses, such as to induce an immune response to antigens, in the production of vaccines, and as adjuvants. It would be advantageous to be able to alter the uptake of CpG ODN by cells, in order to alter the immune response produced by these oligonucleotides. Methods to alter the uptake and subsequent immune activation triggered by CpG ODN are disclosed herein."

One specific, non-limiting example of a statistical test used to assess a substantial increase is the use of a Z test to compare the percent of samples that respond to a D ODN as compared to the percent of samples that respond to a control. A non-paramentric ANOVA can be used to compare differences in the magnitude of the response induced by D ODN as compared to the percent of samples that respond using a control.

In one specific, non-limiting example, a modification that renders the oligodeoxynucleotide less susceptible to degradation is the inclusion of nontraditional bases such as inosine and quesine, as well as acetyl-, thio- and similarly modified forms of adenine, cytidine, guanine, thymine, and uridine. Other modified nucleotides include nonionic DNA analogs, such as alkyl or aryl phosphonates (i.e., the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced with an alkyl or aryl group, as set forth in U.S. Pat.

Oligonucleotides containing a diol, such as tetraethyleneglycol or hexaethyleneglycol, at either or both termini, have also been shown to be more resistant to degradation. The D-type oligodeoxynucleotides can also be modified to contain a secondary structure (e.g., stem-loop structure).

Alternatively, lymphocytes or natural killer cells are contacted with the activated antigen presenting cells in vitro, or with cytokines secreted by the activated antigen presenting cells in vitro, to produce activated lymphocytes or activated natural killer cells. The activated lymphocytes or natural killer cells can then be administered to the subject to induce an immune response.",

The method includes providing an agent that decreases the activity and/or expression of CXCL16. In one example, the agent that decreases the uptake of a D ODN is ionomycin. In another example, the agent that decreases the activity and/or expression of CXCL16 is an antisense oligonucleotide, small inhibitory mRNA (simRNA) or a ribozyme that cleaves CXCL16 mRNA. One of skill in the art can readily produce these molecules using the CXCL nucleic acid sequence and/or protein sequence.",

The antibody or antibody fragment can be a humanized immunoglobulin. Generally, the humanized immunoglobulin specifically binds to the CXCL16, or a molecule that regulates CXCL16, with an affinity constant of at least 107 M\u22121, such as at least 108 M\u22121 or 109 M\u22121. The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of the constant regions of the donor antibody. Techniques for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies are described, for example, by Jones, et al., Nature 321:522, 1986; Riechmann, et al., Nature 332:323, 1988; Verhoeyen, et al., Science 239:1534, 1988; Carter, et al., Proc.

These antibody fragments retain some ability to selectively bind with their antigen or receptor and are defined as follows: (1) Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule, can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain; (2) Fab\u2032, the fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain; two Fab\u2032 fragments are obtained per antibody molecule; (3) (Fab\u2032)2, the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; F(ab\u2032)2 is a dimer of two Fab\u2032 fragments held together by two disulfide bonds; (4) Fv, a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and (5) Single chain antibody (such as scFv), defined as a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule.",

Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics",

Without being bound by theory, agents that increase intracellular calcium are of use in increasing ADAM-10 activity resulting in increased cleavage of CXCL-16. For example, a cross-linking agent can be used to cross link the BDCA-2 receptor on the surface of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This results in increased intracellular calcium flux and a corresponding decrease in CXCL16 activity. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells treated with a cross-linking agent fail to produce interferon alpha in response to a D ODN.",

CXCL16 is an unusual chemokine with SR activity when expressed as a transmembrane molecule at the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (Shimaoka et al., J Biol Chem. 275(52):40663-6, 2000). Based on the initial screening results, the ability of biotin conjugated CpG ODN to bind to purified recombinant CXCL16 was assessed in a cell-free ELISA-based assay and was found to be dose-dependent and significantly higher (P<0.001) for D ODN than the binding levels seen with K ODN (FIG. 1A).",

The percent of HEK293 cells internalizing large amounts of D ODN rose significantly by>5-fold following transfection with a CXCL16 encoding plasmid (p<0.05, FIG. 1B, histogram) as opposed to no change in the case of K ODN. Confocal microscopy revealed that CXCL16 colocalized with D but not with K ODN (FIG. 1B). Of note, the level of CXCL16 surface expression correlated with the magnitude of D ODN uptake (FIG. 1B, compare cells indicated with open versus filled arrow heads).",
                                "To evaluate whether CXCL16 could act as a D ODN-specific cell surface receptor in pDC, expression of this receptor in human pDC was analyzed. Results from flow cytometry studies showed that 20-40% of pDC (FIG. 4A) expressed CXCL16 on their surface. By comparison, Uchiyama et al. (Tabata S. et al., J Leukoc Biol. 77(5):777-86, 2005) described that pDC produce CXCL16, but report that most of this material is cleaved and secreted.",
                                "After confirming that pDC express CXCL16 at their surface, ODN binding to this cell type was assessed in the presence of antibodies against CXCL16. Anti-CXCL16 antibodies significantly inhibited the binding of D ODN to pDC (78.39%, P<0.001, FIG. 1C). Isotype-matched control had no effect on any class of CpG ODN binding. Of note, the CXCL16 antibody specifically inhibited D ODN binding only to pDC but not to the BDCA-2 negative CD123+basophils (FIG. 4B) providing further evidence for the specificity of this inhibition. In contrast, only 10.7% of K ODN binding could be inhibited using anti-CXCL16. These results suggest that CXCL16 is involved in the binding/uptake of D but not K ODN.",

                                "To assess whether pDCs expressing CXCL16 were more responsive to D ODN stimulation, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b1 production from CXCL16bright or dim/negative cells was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (FIG. 2A). K but not D ODN produced significant amounts of TNF\u03b1 from pDCs and 83.21\u00b10.74% of all producers were in the CXCL16 negative/dim population. In contrast, D ODNs induced significant amounts of IFN\u03b1 and almost all of this cytokine (85.51\u00b10.22%) was produced by the CXCL16positive pDCs. Furthermore, stimulation of highly pure sorted CXCL16negative pDC resulted in up-regulation of HLA-DR/CD86 by K but not by D ODNs, whereas as expected both ODNs showed activity in the sorted CXCL16positive+negative population (FIG. 5). Of interest, UV-irradiated HSV-1 showed a very similar activation pattern as observed with D ODNs. These results suggest a preferential stimulation of CXCL16positive pDCs by D but not by K ODNs.",
                                "Additional studies confirmed that the immunostimulatory activity of D class ODNs required recognition by CXCL16. First, anti-CXCL16 antibodies (Abs) reduced D ODNs dependent IFN\u03b1 production by 55.9% (p<0.005 when compared to isotype control, FIG. 2B), but had no significant effect on the ability of K ODNs to stimulate IP-10 production. Second, anti-CXCL16 Abs significantly reduced the ability of D (but not K) ODNs to activate pDC as manifest by the up-regulation of HLA-DR/CD86 expression in elutriated monocytes (FIG. 2C, 68.7% suppression as opposed to 1.4% p.<0.001)",
                                "Whereas K ODNs strongly induce NF-KB signaling by TLR9 transfected HEK293 cells, D ODNs are much less active (Vollmer et al, Eur J Immunol. 34(1):251-62, 2004). As seen in FIG. 6, K ODNs increase NF-kB signaling by nearly 4-fold, versus only 1-1.3-fold by two different D ODNs. Yet when HEK293 cells that stably express TLR9 were transiently transfected with CXCL16, they became highly responsive to D ODN stimulation. The response of CXCL16 transfected TLR9 expressing cells as compared to mock transfected TLR9 expressing cells is presented in FIG. 2D. CXCL16 transfection increases background luciferase activity almost 2-fold for all ODNs irrespective of whether they contain CpG or not except for D class, where significantly higher responses were achieved (6-fold, P<0.05, FIG. 2D) in the presence of CXCL16.",

                                "CXCL16 expressed on the cell surface is cleaved by the metalloproteinase ADAM-10 (Abel et al., J Immunol. 2004 172(10):6362-72, 2004; Gough et al., J Immunol. 172(6):3678-85, 2004). Previous studies demonstrated that the amount of the cell surface expressed CXCL16 can be increased by treatment with the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. Based on the observation that pDC expressing high levels of CXCL16 were more responsive to D ODN stimulation, human PBMC were incubated with GM6001 followed by K or D ODNs. Metalloproteinase inhibitor treatment increased the expression of CXCL16 (FIG. 7) and D ODN responsiveness (2-fold, p<0.05) of pDCs, but had no effect on cells stimulated with K ODN.",
                                "Thus, the scavenger receptor CXCL16 plays a key role in mediating the binding, uptake and subsequent stimulation mediated by D but not K ODNs. Without being bound by theory, the role of CXCL16 in D ODN uptake and activity explains previously observed differences in the targeting and internalization of D ODNs compared to other CpG ODN classes.",
                                "As described herein, pDC expressing high levels of that SR were also the most responsive to D ODN activation. Indeed, a significant positive correlation was noted between CXCL16 expression and cytokine (IFN\u03b1) production by D ODN stimulated pDC. Consistent with this observation, treatment with a metalloproteinase inhibitor that increased cell surface expression of CXCL16 also increased responsiveness to D ODNs. Finally, it was demonstrated that HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding CXCL16 significantly increased their capacity to bind D (but not K) ODNs.",
                                "HEK293 cells transfected to express TLR9 (the cognate receptor for CpG motifs) responded to stimulation by K ODNs. This observation suggests that K-type CpG ODNs do not require CXCL16 for uptake or activity. In contrast, HEK293 cells transfected with TLR9 alone did not respond to D ODNs, but became responsive when co-transfected with CXCL16. Confocal microscopy of these transfected cells showed that D ODNs colocalized extensively with CXCL16, unlike K ODNs.",
                                "The selective binding of D but not K ODNs to CXCL16 could be mediated by the poly G tail unique to D ODNs. The poly G tail present on all D ODNs allows the formation of G-tetrads, and the resultant generation of higher order tertiary structures (Kerkman et al, J Biol Chem. 280(9):8086-93, 2005). In this context, it appears that D ODNs, with its nanoparticle forming ability, is recognized specifically by the scavenger receptor CXCL16 and this highly specific interaction and subsequent internalization may alter the subcellular distribution of this ODN.",
                                "Human pDC are known to produce high amounts of IFN\u03b1 when exposed to enveloped viruses. Since the envelope is derived from the host cell membranes, phosphatidylserine (PS) could to be present in viral envelopes. In fact, for extracellular herpes simplex virus (HSV), the viral membrane was shown to contain a 3-fold higher concentration of PS compared to the host nuclear membrane (van Genderen et al., Virology 200(2):831-6, 1994). PS was one of the first molecules described as being recognized by CXCL16 (Shimaoka et al., J Biol Chem. 275(52):40663-6, 2000). Therefore, PS that is expressed on viral envelopes could be recognized by transmembrane CXCL16 on pDC, thereby facilitating virus internalization and subsequent IFN\u03b1 production.",

Meth A is passaged as an ascitic tumor. Cells are harvested, counted, and washed with PBS before use. Four days after inoculation with 1-2\u00d7106 11A-1, MC-38, or Meth A cells into six-week-old BALB/c mice (via subcutaneous injection in the left flank), small organized tumor nodules are seen on histological section. Tumors are measured twice weekly in three dimensions with calipers. Growth curves truncate when the first mouse in the respective group dies.",

Immunized mice develop vigorous p53-specific CTL responses and are able to reject small, established p53-overexpressing Meth A tumors.",
                                "In order to accelerate tumor injection, mice are treated with 15 nmol of D ODN (or a non-CpG ODN control) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection on days 4, 9, and 14. Groups of mice are administered an agent that induces the expression of CXCL16, such as antagonists of ADAM-10, for example G1254023X or GM6001 in conjunction with the D ODN (see Table 1 for D ODN sequences). On day 5, the mice are immunized i.p. with 5\u00d7107 pfu of MVAp53, 5\u00d7107 pfu of MVApp65, or PBS. The subcutaneous tumors were measured twice weekly in three dimensions with calipers.",

The combination of D ODN and MVAp53 immunization results in diminished tumor outgrowth. The combination of D ODN, MVAp53 and an antagonist of ADAM-10 significantly decreases tumor growth and/or results in decreased tumor burden.",
