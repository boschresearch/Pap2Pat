The fabrication of these systems typically requires the addition of inorganic component, such as a metal salt (e.g., composed of copper, calcium, or manganese phosphate), to biomacromolecules. This approach involves the functional groups of the biomacromolecules, which provide binding sites for the nucleation and subsequent growth of metal phosphate crystals, leading to formation of nanostructured phosphate-based microparticles, with a high surface-to-volume ratio and signature porous structures.",

The purpose was to investigate the effects on structure and morphology of the resulting NMP for a given pair polymer-solvent. The results are summarized in FIG. 1, which displays for each batch the representative micrographies obtained via (i) confocal microscopy and (ii) scanning electron microscopy.",
                                "The latter techniques provide complementary information and, while SEM reveals the overall morphology (e.g. shape, dimension, surface roughness, porosity), the confocal microscopy clearly render an insight about the \u201cstructural\u201d properties in terms of polymer density within the NMP. The morphology of the microsponges obtained in the DMSO (d-NMP) and in pure water (w-NMP) demonstrates the successful formation of NMP with all different polysaccharides and indicates that CL can also react with either neutral polysaccharides or negatively charged polysaccharides chain to form NMP. The cross-linker crystalline domains form the scaffold of the particles whereas the polymer chains act as a \u201cglue\u201d to bind the CL crystalline domains together.",
                                "Remarkably, the w-NMPs exhibit consistently a core shell structure with a less fluorescent core and a highly fluorescent corona. This indicates that the RITC-polysaccharides are predominately located on the periphery of the NMP. Conversely, the d-NMP synthetized via the DMSO route shows an even distribution of the fluorescent polysaccharides throughout the NMP particle for dextran and HA and a fluorescent core in the case of alginate and CM-dextran. These different structures can be ascribed to the different kinetic of crystallization of the CL in water and DMSO. The faster precipitation of the CL in water produces a crystalline core excluding the polysaccharides chains; subsequently the polysaccharides chains form a composite polysaccharides-CL porous outer corona. During the slow precipitation of CL in the case of DMSO solvent the polysaccharide chains remain embedded during the all process of growth of NMP. A peculiar onion-like structure was observed for alginate-based d-NMP with an inner layer composed primarily of CL.",
                                "The general NMP formation process entails that the carbonyl imidazole moieties present on the CL reacts with either the carboxylic groups or hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides to form amide or ester cross-linkages respectively. The structure of the reactive molecule of the CL was confirmed by NMR spectra and mass spectroscopy.",
                                "Table I summarizes some relevant outcomes of the synthesis process (i.e. NMP diameter, surface pore size, yield, swelling ratio) for each batch in this analysis. The NMP particles always show a highly porous outer surface, with pores ranging from 60 to 160 nm, as estimated from SEM images in the vacuum-dry state. As for the NMP diameter, SEM and confocal analysis deliver information about swollen and dry particles, allowing the computation of swelling ratio of NMP in water. The results suggest that the particles are quite uniform in size, either in dry or swollen state. The high swelling ratio values measured for any NMP ranged from 1.6 to 5.3 and indicated a high capability to adsorb water in all cases. The swelling capability of NMP is a telling ex-post measurement of capillary suction of a NMP microsponge, which is very relevant for drug upload, and is correlated to both the nanoporosity structure and the elastic response of the CL system. In particular, a discernible difference in the porosity was noticed for alginate based NMPs, exhibiting a remarkable capacity to swell up to 500% in combination with the smaller pores. For drug delivery purposes, the optimal pore diameter (indicative of the capillarity structure for a given NMP diameter) could be seen as a trade-off between maximizing the effective water uptake and ensuring sufficient higher cut-off in the size of drugs or biomacromolecules to enter into the NMP. For a better comparison of NMP diameter results, the size distribution for each batch are shown in FIG. 2.",
                                "In order to have a comparison, NMPs were produced starting from hyaluronic acid with an average MW of 800 kDa. All the above preparation conditions were repeated. These NMPs were measured to have an average diameter of 3.3\u00b10.9 \u03bcm in the absence of water and an average diameter of 4.2\u00b10.9 \u03bcm when swollen due to the presence of water. As can be immediate, the NMPs of this comparison example have a swelling ratio much lower than those of the hyaluronic acid NMPs of the invention.",
                                "From a synthesis stand-point, the reaction yields for each polysaccharide are consistently quite high, which is industrially relevant when considering that such values were observed also while scaling up the reaction. Finally, the degradation of NMP under redox treatment was evaluated as it is an important parameter for applications entailing the slow release of the polysaccharide. As the CL bears a disulfide bridge, the inventors verified the ability of NMP to be deconstructed under redox treatment. RITC labelled NMPs were incubated in a solution of DTT 10 mM in PBS a reducing agent that could mimic the glutathione action in the biological environment. After 10 h incubation with DTT, approximately 80% of NMPs was disassembled into soluble polysaccharide chains."

Lysozyme is preferentially up-taken by d-NMP whereas serum albumin is equally adsorbed by both d-NMP and w-NMP. This indicates that the composite nanostructured template of d-NMP interacts more efficiently with different type of proteins.\n\n(ii) On the other end, the efficiency of w-NMP (70-80%) in releasing the adsorbed proteins is higher than d-NMP efficiency (40-70%).\n\n(iii) The adsorption is nearly completed after 4 h while the release typically occurs on a scale of days.",

As the CL exerts a vital role in the fabrication of NMPs, an additional control (CRLK) was performed adding the CL in complete medium without the polysaccharide. Results are reported in FIG. 7 as percentage of living cells (n=3, p<0.05). No value was found significant compared to the relative controls, indicating lack of cytotoxicity of both CL and NMPs. This confirms that NMPs are indeed safe and non-toxic, as observed in our prior study.
