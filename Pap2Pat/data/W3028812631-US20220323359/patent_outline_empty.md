# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

## BACKGROUND ART

## OBJECT OF THE INVENTION

## MATERIALS

### Synthesis and Characterization of the Cross-Linking Solutions

### Synthesis and Characterization of Nanoporous Microsponge Particles (NMPs)

### Preparation of Polysaccharide Fluorescently Labelled with Rhodamine B Isothiocyanate

## Degradation Kinetics of NMP

## Protein Adsorption and Release in Particles

## Cell Assays for Cito-Toxicity and Adhesion/Internalization of NMPs

### Cell Viability

### Study of Cell Adhesion/Internalization of NMPs by Confocal Microscopy

## Results and Discussion

### Two-ways Parametric Study on NMP Synthesis vs. (i) Polymer and (ii) Cross-Linker Solvent

### NMP as Platform for Sequestration and Release of Proteins

### Dependence of Adsorption/Release Profiles vs. pH and Protein Distribution within the NMP

### Toxicity Assays

### Study of Cell Interaction and Uptake of NMPs
