    "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the most prevalent procedures for cancer treatment, but the risks of malignancies induced by peripheral beam in healthy tissues surrounding the target is high. Therefore, being able to accurately measure the exposure dose is a critical aspect of patient care. Here a radiation detector based on an organic field\u2010effect transistor (RAD\u2010OFET) is introduced, an in vivo dosimeter that can be placed directly on a patient's skin to validate in real time the dose being delivered and ensure that for nearby regions an acceptable level of low dose is being received. This device reduces the errors faced by current technologies in approximating the dose profile in a patient's body, is sensitive for doses relevant to radiation treatment procedures, and robust when incorporated into conformal large\u2010area electronics. A model is proposed to describe the operation of RAD\u2010OFETs, based on the interplay between charge photogeneration and trapping.",

                "The organic field\u2010effect transistors used in this work had a bottom\u2010gate, bottom contact geometry.[  23  ] This device architecture allows for direct exposure of the organic semiconductor to the radiation beam. We started with a rigid structure, with a SiO2 layer playing the role of bottom\u2010gate dielectric, and later expanded to large\u2010area flexible substrates with a Cytop gate dielectric. The contacts were made of Au and the semiconductor was 2,8\u2010difluoro\u20105,11\u2010bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (diF\u2010TES ADT), a material that has shown remarkable electrical properties, with charge carrier mobilities close to 20 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 in devices with near ideal current\u2013voltage characteristics,[  24  ] and strong sensitivity to X\u2010rays, although past work has focused on much higher doses and used different methods for detection.[  5 ,  25  ] The OFETs were fabricated using standard procedures and their electrical properties were first characterized in air and dark, prior to exposure.[  24  ] The devices were sandwiched without compression between two slabs of tissue\u2010equivalent calibration layers and irradiated through the top layer. The experimental set\u2010up is shown in Figure\u00a0 2a. The X\u2010ray radiation was supplied by a medical\u2010grade linear accelerator (Elekta Versa HD, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center), and the corresponding relative dose as a function of depth is shown in Figure\u00a02b. Test samples consisting of arrays of OFET devices were placed in the center of the X\u2010ray field, as described in the Experimental Section. This setup reproduces the reference irradiation geometry used for radiation beam calibration in the clinical setting. The samples were exposed to radiation doses in increments of 0.2\u00a0Gy between 0 and 1\u00a0Gy, and in increments of 2\u00a0Gy from 2 to 10\u00a0Gy, at a nominal dose rate of 6\u00a0Gy min\u22121. Control samples were fabricated using identical procedures, but were not exposed to X\u2010rays, and were tested along with the irradiated ones, to be able to decouple the aging effects from the interaction with radiation (see Figure S1, Supporting Information).",
                "Typical device output characteristics are shown in Figure\u00a02c, where we plot the drain current I D as a function of drain\u2013source voltage V DS for fixed gate\u2013source voltages, V GS. In Figure\u00a02d we show the dependence of I D on V GS at constant V DS before exposure to radiation (solid line, see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information for forward and reverse sweeps) and after absorbing 100 cGy of radiation (dashed line); the curves obtained after other exposure doses are included in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. It can be clearly observed that irradiation caused a shift in the threshold voltage of the OFET, i.e., the intercept of square\u2010root\u2010of\u2010drain\u2010current curve (blue) and the V GS\u2010axis, as marked in Figure\u00a02d (more details about the analysis can be found in Figure S4, Supporting Information). This shift \u0394V Th is described by Equation\u00a0(1) \\(\\Delta V_{Th} = V_{ThD} - V_{{Th}0}\\) where V ThD represents the threshold voltage at the target dose and V Th0 the threshold voltage at zero dose, i.e., before irradiation. To ensure that the threshold voltage was uniformly determined for each measurement, we adopted the method of the second derivative of I D with respect to V GS.[  24  ] This type of dosimetry, where the measurements are taken after exposing the sample to radiation, is referred to as passive. Passive sensors rely on the detection of changes induced in the sample upon exposure to radiation and that persist after exposure; on the contrary, active sensors monitor in real time by recording the photoconductive gain.[  26  ] In this case, a passive detection ensures that the irradiation and device testing take place sequentially, i.e., there is no voltage applied to the RAD\u2010OFET while it is placed on a patient.",
                "In Figure\u00a0 3a we plot the shift in the threshold voltage as a function of radiation dose, in red, along with the changes recorded in the control sample. While the control samples exhibit negligible changes, a shift in the threshold voltage can be observed upon irradiation, with two regions being clearly distinguished. At low irradiation doses, Region I\u2014between 0 to 1\u00a0Gy, the irradiated OFETs exhibited a positive shift in the threshold voltage, up to a value of 6.1 \u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0V, obtained at 1\u00a0Gy. The average sensitivity of the detector, defined as S v = \u2206V Th/Dose, was determined to be S V = 60 \u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mV cGy\u22121 for region I, a value which corresponds to S I = (2.2 \u00d7 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u00d7 107) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123, where S I = (I D \u2212 I D,0)/(Detector Volume \u00d7 Dose Rate), I D is the current measured after exposure, and I D,0 is the current prior to irradiation (both currents correspond to an applied gate\u2013source voltage of V GS = \u221260\u00a0V). This sensitivity value is similar to that obtained at high doses with other dosimeters based on organic semiconductors,[  5 ,  11  ] but in our case the performance was obtained under clinically relevant conditions for radiation treatment, where typical doses applied to patients do not exceed 200 cGy per treatment. In Region II, from 1 to 10\u00a0Gy, a negative shift in the threshold voltage is observed, with a sensitivity of S V = 4.6 \u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0mV cGy\u22121 (S I = (8.9 \u00d7 106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u00d7 106) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123).",
                "To gain more insight into the processes responsible for the observed threshold voltage shifts, we also evaluated the evolution of the charge carrier mobility (\u03bc) in response to sample irradiation. The mobility was calculated from the slope of the square\u2010root of the drain current curve with respect to the gate\u2013source voltage (blue curves in Figure\u00a02d), using Equation\u00a0(2) \\(I_{D} = \\frac{W}{L}\\frac{C_{i}}{2}\\mu\\left( {V_{GS} - V_{Th}} \\right)^{2}\\) where L and W are the channel length and the channel width, respectively, and C i the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric.[  23  ] Figure\u00a03b shows the response of \u03bc to cumulative dose; it is notable that the mobility did not change over the course of the treatments, suggesting that the organic semiconductor layer does not experience major chemical changes. Indeed, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography, UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, and thin\u2010layer chromatography indicated that no degradation occurs in the organic semiconductor film. We do not exclude, however, that chemical changes take place, but the resulting impurity is below the detection limit of our techniques. Attempts to restore the device properties by thermal annealing or room\u2010temperature annealing resulted in partial recovery, while the solvent annealing results were inconclusive (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). The evolution of sensitivity with the gate\u2010source voltage for the low and high dose rates is included in Figure\u00a03c in yellow and blue, respectively. At low bias the sensitivity is hampered by multiple trapping and de\u2010trapping events, which also impact the accuracy of reading, as demonstrated by the large error bars. When the voltage exceeds a critical value, which allows most of the holes accumulated in the transistor channel to be free, only a small dependence of the gate\u2010source voltage is recorded, thus the RAD\u2010OFET response is independent on the applied voltage.",
                "The experimental results obtained upon controlled X\u2010ray irradiation of the OFETs allowed us to propose a mechanism for the operation of the RAD\u2010OFET dosimeters. The invariance in charge carrier mobility, along with partial recovery upon annealing, encouraged us to consider interfacial effects and structural defects as possible causes for the observed changes. The positive threshold voltage shift recorded upon exposure to low dose rates (Regime I) is indicative of electron trapping, a phenomenon that can occur either in the dielectric or in the organic semiconductor, close to the semiconductor/dielectric interface. The interaction of X\u2010rays with the OFETs results in a cascade of events. First, ionizing radiation causes the formation of an electron\u2013hole pair, i.e., an exciton, in the organic semiconductor and in the SiO2 layers (see Figure\u00a0 4a).[  27 ,  28 ,  29  ] A fraction of these photogenerated charges will immediately recombine, while the rest will dissociate, resulting in free electrons and holes. The electrons are trapped at the semiconductor/dielectric interface by hydroxyl groups or other impurities and defects present here, while the holes, which are more resilient to trapping events, contribute directly to transport.[  30  ] There will be two contributions to the hole density: one from the processes occurring within the organic semiconductor layer, and the other from the dielectric, where the holes move through a series of hopping states toward the dielectric/semiconductor interface to contribute to transport (Figure\u00a04a). The effect can be reduced if a high density of holes remains trapped in the oxide, a process that would contribute to a negative shift in the threshold voltage, which counteracts the effect of the holes that migrate to the interface and contribute to a positive shift. By performing capacitance measurements on the SiO2 dielectric layer (Figure\u00a04b), we concluded that the hole trapping in the oxide is minimal, since the dielectric capacitance remained constant at the dose levels used in this study, at an average value of C i = 17 \u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nF cm\u22122. Some of the holes that reach the interface may, however, become deeply trapped here, creating long\u2010lived states which persist over longer time scales (e.g., days, months) and contribute to a negative shift in threshold voltage. While in Region I the photogeneration of holes overcomes the trapping events, resulting in a shift toward more positive threshold voltages, the higher doses (>100 cGy) experienced by the OFETs in Regime II appear to generate significant hole trapping and lead to a negative shift. This shift results from the eventual build\u2010up of deeply trapped holes at the interface and the structural defects occurring in the semiconductor, although we do not exclude the possibility of material degradation at levels below the detection limit of our chemical analysis techniques, but that are relevant to electronic transport.",
                "Trap generation in organic materials upon interaction with ionizing radiation has sparked great interest lately. Batlogg and co\u2010workers showed that proton irradiation results in cleaving of the C\u2500H bond in single crystal rubrene, a process that generates deep trap states.[  31  ] They also found that X\u2010ray irradiation yields local structural disorder, which is a common source of traps in organic semiconductors.[  32  ] Proton irradiation of triisopropylsilyl ethynyl (TIPS) pentacene OFETs resulted in positional disorder,[  33  ] and electron irradiation of rubrene thin films induced n\u2010doping and a negative threshold voltage shift.[  34  ] Podzorov et\u00a0al. used air\u2010gap rubrene OFETs to eliminate the interfacial affects and concluded that the shifts recorded in the threshold voltage upon interaction with X\u2010rays result from the deep traps created in the crystal.[  35  ] Figure\u00a04c includes a sketch of possible molecular re\u2010orientations leading to positional disorder in the diF\u2010TES ADT film. The solid\u2010state packing was elucidated in our past work,[  36  ] and the distortion is exaggerated here for clarity: it includes rotations (1, 3), translations (2), and a combination of both (4). Such defects have been shown to be the origin of electronic traps with an energetic distribution that is dependent on the material and the exact nature of the defect.[  37 ,  38  ] A schematic representation of the energetic distribution of the trap density of states is included in Figure\u00a04d, with shallow traps creating acceptor\u2010like and donor\u2010like tail states in the vicinity of the frontier orbitals and deep traps laying in the middle of the bandgap. Since we have not observed changes in charge carrier mobility upon exposure to radiation (Figure\u00a03b), we hypothesize that the molecular re\u2010arrangements generate deep traps. De\u2010trapping of charge carriers residing here is highly unlikely since the trap depth is high, and thus they cannot contribute to transport.[  32  ]",
                "The tests performed on samples fabricated on silicon substrates provide robust perspectives for OFET adoption in medical radiation dosimetry. To take full advantage of the unique properties of organic semiconductors, next we integrated them with flexible substrates. Large\u2010area, flexible dosimeters can be placed directly onto the patient without the need for additional hardware, allowing for a higher accuracy and resolution of radiation detection and reducing the complexity and cost of the medical equipment. These devices were fabricated in a bottom gate, bottom contact configuration, onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrates with a predefined indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, which played the role of the gate electrode, and Cytop gate dielectric (Figure\u00a0 5a). Due to the hydrophobic nature of the fluorinated polymer Cytop, an additional surface treatment was applied to increase its surface energy and allow solution deposition of the organic semiconductor, as described elsewhere.[  39  ] These devices exhibited similar shifts in the threshold voltage, and the resulting sensitivity was (5.2 \u00d7 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 \u00d7 107) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123. To test the mechanical robustness of the flexible OFET dosimeter, devices were flexed using a computer\u2010controlled servo (Figure\u00a05c, inset) to a bending radius of 8\u00a0mm. Devices were exposed to a dose of 100 cGy and the sensitivity was measured as a function of the number of folding and unfolding cycles; the results for different effective gate\u2010source voltages are included in Figure\u00a05, where the effective gate\u2010source voltage is the difference between the applied gate voltage and the device threshold voltage V\u2005 GS,eff = V GS \u2212 V Th.",
                "The dependence of sensitivity on gate\u2010source voltage is in agreement with the results presented in Figure\u00a03c. As for the tolerance to bending, a slight decrease in sensitivity occurs after 10 bends, most likely due to mechanical strains created at device interfaces and partial layer delamination, followed by a region of constant response between 10 and 10\u00a0000 bending cycles. A drastic decrease in sensitivity is observed after 10\u00a0000 cycles. Optical inspection of the films suggests that the micro\u2010cracks that formed in the film are responsible for the performance degradation. Nevertheless, the good tolerance to folding exhibited by our OFET radiation detectors for the first 1000 bending cycles makes them attractive for incorporation in large area flexible radiation detectors.",
                "We introduced a new concept for fabricating passive radiation dosimeters for medical applications, which we named the RAD\u2010OFET. The device is based on organic thin\u2010film transistors, and the radiation dose is detected as a shift in the threshold voltage. The sensor is robust and highly sensitive for doses relevant to a variety of medical radiation procedures, including patient dose monitoring during cancer diagnosis and therapy. To understand the results, we proposed a model based on photogeneration of charges upon X\u2010ray exposure, followed by charge trapping at the semiconductor/dielectric interface. The hole dynamics is governed by a competition between the accumulation of the photogenerated holes and deep trapping within the organic semiconductor, a process which is highly depended on the radiation dose. For RAD\u2010OFETs fabricated on silicon substrates, at low doses, below 200 cGy, trapping is minimal, and a positive shift is recorded in the threshold voltage, with a sensitivity of 60 \u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mV cGy\u22121 ((2.2 \u00d7 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u00d7 107) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123). At high doses the trap formation prevails, leading to a negative shift and a sensitivity of 4.6 \u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0mV cGy\u22121 ((8.9 \u00d7 106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u00d7 106) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123). Solution processing allowed for integration with flexible substrates for the development of conformal RAD\u2010OFETs with high sensitivties, (5.2 \u00d7 107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 \u00d7 107) \u00b5C Gy\u22121 cm\u22123. Placement of the sensor directly onto the human body, coupled with the similarity in the atomic number between the electronically active layer and the human tissue, may greatly enhance the precision and reduce the complexity of the medical equipment, facilitating high quality measurement of patient doses. The application of therapeutic radiation with high precision increases the effectiveness on treating cancerous tissue and minimizes the impact on the surrounding healthy cells. The sensitivity of the proposed devices can be further enhanced with fine tuning the molecular structure of the organic semiconductor layer. These findings uncover new opportunities for organic circuits that will not only improve the quality of patient care, but they can have applications even beyond the cancer therapy. Such applications include OFET dosimeter placement in unique irradiation geometries and types, monitoring of personnel dose in hazardous environments, and measurement of space radiation."

Proton NMR analysis of the irradiated sample (400\u00a0MHz Bruker Advance NEO) showed traces of endoperoxide, but this impurity often forms during sample preparation, and the same trace impurity was found when preparing pristine samples of diF TES ADT using the same conditions."

                                        "The data used for the extraction of threshold voltage shifts was not pre\u2010processed before the analysis. The sensitivity of the dosimeters was extracted at constant effective gate\u2010source voltage, where the effective gate\u2010source voltage is the difference between the applied gate\u2010source voltage and the device threshold voltage V GS,eff = V GS \u2212 V Th. Device outliers were excluded prior to analysis based on the reliability of the I D 1/2\u00a0versus V GS curve, using the coefficient of determination (R 2) value of a linear fit to the data. Values less than R 2 = 97% were excluded, as the model shown in Equation\u00a0(2) predicts linear behavior of I D 1/2\u00a0versus V GS. Results are presented as (mean \u00b1 SD), where SD represents standard deviation, followed by the appropriate units. All experiments had a sample size of at least n = 10, and statistical analysis was performed using OriginPro 2016 (OriginLab Corporation)."
