    "abstract": "A fault tolerant quantum computer is implementing using hybrid acoustic-electric qubits. A control circuit includes an asymmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference devices (ATS) that excites phonons in a mechanical resonator by driving a storage mode of the mechanical resonator and dissipates phonons from the mechanical resonator via an open transmission line coupled to the control circuit, wherein the open transmission line is configured to absorb photons from a dump mode of the control circuit.

It is currently the only physical theory that is capable of consistently predicting the behavior of microscopic quantum objects like photons, molecules, atoms, and electrons.",
                        "A quantum computer is a device that utilizes quantum mechanics to allow one to write, store, process and read out information encoded in quantum states, e.g. the states of quantum objects. A quantum object is a physical object that behaves according to the laws of quantum physics. The state of a physical object is a description of the object at a given time.",
                        "In quantum mechanics, the state of a two-level quantum system, or simply, a qubit, is a list of two complex numbers whose squares sum up to one. Each of the two numbers is called an amplitude, or quasi-probability. The square of an amplitude gives a potentially negative probability. Hence, each of the two numbers correspond to the square root that event zero and event one will happen, respectively. A fundamental and counterintuitive difference between a probabilistic bit (e.g. a traditional zero or one bit) and the qubit is that a probabilistic bit represents a lack of information about a two-level classical system, while a qubit contains maximal information about a two-level quantum system.",
                        "Quantum computers are based on such quantum bits (qubits), which may experience the phenomena of \u201csuperposition\u201d and \u201centanglement.\u201d Superposition allows a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. For example, whereas a classical computer is based on bits that are either zero or one, a qubit may be both zero and one at the same time, with different probabilities assigned to zero and one. Entanglement is a strong correlation between quantum particles, such that the quantum particles are inextricably linked in unison even if separated by great distances.",
                        "A quantum algorithm is a reversible transformation acting on qubits in a desired and controlled way, followed by a measurement on one or multiple qubits. For example, if a system has two qubits, a transformation may modify four numbers; with three qubits this becomes eight numbers, and so on. As such, a quantum algorithm acts on a list of numbers exponentially large as dictated by the number of qubits. To implement a transform, the transform may be decomposed into small operations acting on a single qubit, or a set of qubits, as an example. Such small operations may be called quantum gates and the arrangement of the gates to implement a transformation may form a quantum circuit.",
                        "There are different types of qubits that may be used in quantum computers, each having different advantages and disadvantages. For example, some quantum computers may include qubits built from superconductors, trapped ions, semiconductors, photonics, etc. Each may experience different levels of interference, errors and decoherence. Also, some may be more useful for generating particular types of quantum circuits or quantum algorithms, while others may be more useful for generating other types of quantum circuits or quantum algorithms. Also, costs, run-times, error rates, availability, etc. may vary across quantum computing technologies.",
                        "For some types of quantum computations, such as fault tolerant computation of large scale quantum algorithms, overhead costs for performing such quantum computations may be high. For example for types of quantum gates that are not naturally fault tolerant, the quantum gates may be encoded in error correcting code. However this may add to the overhead number of qubits required to implement the large scale quantum algorithms. Also, performing successive quantum gates, measurement of quantum circuits, etc. may introduce probabilities of errors in the quantum circuits and/or measured results of the quantum circuits.",

Further, the overhead cost for achieving such low error rates may need to be low. In order to achieve fault tolerance, surface codes are often used. However, such surface codes must also be fault tolerant and efficiently use resources.",
                        "In some embodiments, efficiently implementing a universal gate set and/or surface codes may involve multiple layers of a quantum computer/quantum algorithm. For example at a lowest layer, building blocks of a quantum computer may include nano-mechanical resonators that are controlled using an asymmetrically-threaded superconducting quantum interference device (asymmetrically-threaded SQUID or ATS). The nano-mechanical resonators may be configured to resonate at one or more frequencies and may be coupled to the ATS, wherein the ATS controls the phonic modes. Also the ATS may be coupled to a bandpass filter and then an open transmission line that enables photons from the ATS to be adsorbed by the environment. At a next level, error correction may be implemented for the quantum computer comprising nano-mechanical resonators and an ATS. For example error corrected codes may be built that utilize the ATS and phononic modes of the nano-mechanical resonators to detect and/or correct errors. At yet another level, gates may be implemented for the quantum computer using the error corrected codes as inputs or outputs to the gates. Also, qubits of the gates may be error corrected. At yet a higher level logical gates may be built that utilize one or more of the physical gates.",

Such cross talk may lead to stochastic errors induced by effective dissipators (type I errors), stochastic errors induced by effective Hamiltonians (type II errors), and/or coherent errors induced by effective Hamiltonians (type III errors). In some embodiments, a filter bandpass range of a filter included in the multiplexed control circuit (e.g. multiplexed ATS) may be selected such that type I and type II errors are suppressed. Moreover, strategic selection of phononic mode frequencies and detunings of dump modes of the multiplexed control circuits (e.g. multiplexed ATSs) may effectively suppress type III errors.",

                        "Also, in some embodiments, a hybrid Bacon-Shor surface code may be used instead of a traditional surface code. The hybrid Bacon-Shor surface code may only require four phonic modes per given multiplexed control circuit (e.g. four phononic modes coupled to a given multiplexed ATS). This is in comparison to a traditional surface code that couples five phononic modes per multiplexed control circuit (e.g. five phononic modes coupled to a given multiplexed ATS). The reduction in coupling ratio of phononic modes per multiplexed control circuit (e.g. multiplexed ATS) may reduce probabilities of cross talk errors as compared to traditional surface codes."

The nano-mechanical resonators and ATS may implement qubits that are hybrid acoustic-electrical qubits, for example as opposed to electromagnetic qubits. In some embodiments, both the nano-mechanical resonators and ATS may be situated on a same component and may provide for easily extending a system to include additional components with additional nano-mechanical resonators that implement additional hybrid acoustic-electrical qubits. This may also enable scaling of a number of qubits needed for a quantum computer by including more or fewer components. Such an approach may allow for simpler extension and scaling than a system wherein components that implement qubits are integrated into a single chip, and newly designed chips are required to extend or scale the system to have more or fewer qubits. As used herein, the terms \u201cmechanical\u201d. \u201cacoustic\u201d, \u201cphononic\u201d, etc. may be used to describe mechanical circuits as opposed to electromagnetic circuits.",

This is due, at least in part, to the smaller size of the phononic resonators as compared to electromagnetic resonators. However, in such systems cross-talk between the phononic resonators coupled to the same control circuit must be addressed in order to avoid errors. Multiplexed control of phononic resonators using a common control circuit, such as an ATS, is further discussed in detail below.",
                                "In some embodiments, a structure of a chip comprising phononic resonators may take the form of a planar circuit with metal components that form superconducting circuits, such as the ATS. The ATS may be physically connected via wire leads to very small (e.g. micron-sized or nano-sized) suspended mechanical devices, such as a linear nano-mechanical resonator. The suspended mechanical devices may be located on a same chip with the ATS circuit or may by located on a separate chip that has been heterogeneously integrated via a flip chip, or similar component, with a bottom chip comprising the ATS and/or additional suspended mechanical devices, e.g. other mechanical resonators.",

In some embodiments, different variables, such as piezoelectric coefficient, density, etc. may affect how strongly coupled the ATS is to the mechanical resonators. This coupling may be expressed in terms of a phonon coupling rate in the Hamiltonian for the system.",
                                "When coupling a nano-structure, such as a nano-mechanical resonator, to an electrical circuit, very small capacitors are required since the nano-structure components, e.g. nano-mechanical resonators, are also very small. Typically in an electrical circuit, such as an ATS circuit, there are other capacitances. Since the capacitor for the nano-structure is very small, these other capacitances in the circuit may lower the signal voltage and thus dilute a signal directed to one of the nano-components, such as a nano-mechanical resonator. However, to deal with this issue, a high-impedance inductor may be coupled in the control circuit between the ATS and the nano-mechanical resonator. The high-impedance inductor may have a very low parasitic capacitance, thus electrical fields directed at the nano-mechanical resonators may act on the nano-mechanical resonators with only minimal dilution due to capacitance of the inductor (e.g. parasitic capacitance). Also, the high impedance inductor may suppress loss mechanisms.",

For example quantum information may be stored in storage mode 106. The stored quantum information may also be autonomously error corrected by way of artificially induced two-phonon driving and two-phonon decay controlled by the ATS. These two phonon processes are induced through the non-linear interaction g2 \u00e22{circumflex over (b)}\u2020+h.c. between the storage mode a and an ancillary mode b, called the dump, such as dump mode 104 shown in FIG. 1A.

If Kd is much larger (e.g. \u02dc10\u00d7 or more) than the coupling rate g2, then the dump mode can be adiabatically eliminated from the Hamiltonian, for example as shown in FIG. 1B. For example, as shown on the right side of FIG. 1B, the emission of phonon pairs via g2\u00e22{circumflex over (b)}\u2020 can be accurately modeled as a dissipative process described by a dissipator \u02dcD[a2].

This sets an upper bound on the size of the frequency region that the de-tunings are allowed to occupy. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the de-tunings \u0394n may all be different from each other by amount greater than k2 in order for the dissipation to be incoherent. In a frequency domain picture, the spectral lines associated with emission of photons/phonons out of the dump must all be resolved. This, also sets a lower bound on the proximity of different tunings. As such, since an upper bound and lower bound are set, bandwidth limits for the de-tunings may be determined. Also, taking into account these limitations, an upper bound on the number of modes that can be simultaneously stabilized by a single dump can also be determined. For example, if de-tunings are selected to be \u0394n=n\u0394, with \u0394\u02dck2, then the maximum number of modes that may be simultaneously stabilized may be limited as Nmax\u02dckb/\u0394\u02dckb/k2. As a further example, for typical parameters, such as kb/2\u03c0\u02dc10 MHz and k2/2\u03c0\u02dc1 MHz, this results in bandwidth limits that allow for approximately 10 modes to be simultaneously stabilized.",

Thus, in some embodiments, using a large inductor in the ATS may result in a large effective impedance Zd. In some embodiments, the inductor chosen to be included in the ATS circuit may be sufficiently linear to ensure stability of the dump circuit when driven strongly during stabilization. For example, a high impedance inductor used may comprise a planar meander or double-spiral inductor, a spiral inductor with air bridges, an array with a large number of (e.g. greater than 50) highly transparent Josephson junction, or other suitable high impedance inductor.",

For example, FIG. 4 illustrates control circuit 400 that includes a single dump resonator 404, multiple storage resonators 406, and a filter 402.",

For example, these terms take the form of g2ajakb+e\u2212ivt. After adiabatic elimination of the b mode (for example as discussed in regard to FIG. 1B), these terms effectively become jump operators of the form k2,effajake\u2212ivt. Unlike the desired jump processes k2, aj2, which result in the individual stabilization of the cat subspace of each resonator, the correlated decay terms result in simultaneous phase flips of the resonators j and k. For example, these correlated errors can be damaging to the next layer of error correction, such as in a repetition or striped surface code.",

This may result in an exponential suppression of the unwanted terms. Said another way, the de-tunings and filter may be selected such that detuning of the effective Hamiltonian is larger than half the filter bandwidth. Moreover, the filter mode (along with the dump mode) may be adiabatically eliminated from the model in a similar manner as discussed in FIG. 1B for the adiabatic elimination of the dump mode. This may be used to determine an effective dissipator for a circuit such as control circuit 400 that includes both dump resonator 404 and filter 402.",
                                "As discussed above, correlated phase errors may be suppressed by a filter if the corresponding emitted photons have frequencies outside of the filter pass bandwidth. In some embodiments, all correlated phase errors may be simultaneously suppressed by carefully choosing the frequencies of the storage modes. For example cost functions may be used taking into account a filter bandwidth to determine optimized storage frequencies. For example, in some embodiments a single ATS/dump may be used to suppress decoherence associated with all effective Hamiltonians for 5 storage modes. In such embodiments, all dominant sources of stochastic, correlated phase errors in the cat qubits may be suppressed. Cross talk suppression via selection of filter passband ranges and strategic selection of phononic mode frequencies and dump mode detunings is further discussed in detail below."

When the frequencies of these emitted photons lie outside the filter passband, their emission (and the associated decoherence) is suppressed. Crucially, it can be arranged for all such errors to be suppressed simultaneously by carefully choosing the frequencies of the phonon modes, as shown in FIGS. 7A-7C. The configuration of mode frequencies in FIG. 7C was found via a numerical optimization procedure described in further detail below. The optimization also accounts for the undesired coherent evolution: the detunings \u03b4ijk\u2212\u03b4imn are maximized so that \u0124eff is rapidly rotating and its damaging effects are mitigated (this suppression is quantified further below). Additionally, it is noted that in FIG. 7B all emitted photon frequencies associated with crosstalk lie at least 10 MHz outside of the filter passband. As a result, the crosstalk suppression is robust to variations in the phonon mode frequencies of the same order. Larger variations in the phonon mode frequencies can be accommodated by reducing the filter bandwidth.",

Because the desired couplings (g2\u00e2n2{circumflex over (b)}\u2020ei\u0394t+h.c.) are detuned by different amounts, photons lost to the environment via the buffer have different frequencies. When the corresponding emitted photons (702) are spectrally well resolved, |\u0394n\u2212\u0394m|>>4|\u03b1|2k2, the modes are stabilized independently. Dissipation associated with photon emissions at frequencies inside the filter passband (704) is strong, while dissipation associated with emission at frequencies outside the passband is (706) suppressed. In FIG. 7B the lines 708 denote photon emission frequencies associated with various correlated errors, calculated for the specific phonon mode frequencies plotted in FIG. 7C.

In doing so, so, the effects of Type III errors can also be simultaneously minimized. Importantly, the phonon mode frequencies are chosen to be compatible with error correction in the surface code. However, the surface code architecture may constrain the choice of phonon mode frequencies. To understand the constraints imposed by the implementation of the surface code, recall that each ATS (e.g. multiplexed control circuit) is coupled to five phononic modes. Among the five modes, four modes (two data and two ancilla modes for the surface code) are stabilized in the cat-code manifold by an ATS. Another mode (readout mode) is dedicated to measuring cat qubits in the X basis and is not stabilized by any ATS. Since every data or ancilla mode couples to two ATSs, each ATS is only responsible for stabilizing two of the five phononic modes to which it couples. Thus, for each given ATS, it is necessary to determine which two phononic modes should be stabilized. An important consideration in deciding which phononic modes should be stabilized by a given ATS is that each ATS is used to realize four CNOT gates (performed in four different time steps) to measure the stabilizers of the surface code. While a CNOT gate is being performed, the target mode of the CNOT gate is stabilized by a rotating jump operator",

Black arrows indicate which phononic modes are stabilized by each ATS at each time step; each phononic mode at the tip of a black arrow is stabilized by the ATS at the arrow's tail. Importantly, every target mode of a CNOT gate is stabilized by an ATS that also couples to the corresponding control mode at all time steps. Note, however, that a given ATS stabilizes different modes at different time steps, as summarized in the bottom panel of FIG. 9. In particular, there are two stabilization configurations: in configuration 1 (2) modes \u03b1,\u03b2(\u03b3,\u03b4) are stabilized by the given ATS, and the remaining modes \u03b3,\u03b4(\u03b1,\u03b2) are stabilized by some other neighboring ATSs.",

While stochastic crosstalk errors can be strongly suppressed by filtering and careful choice of the frequencies of the phononic modes, coherent micro-oscillation errors cannot be eliminated by the filters. In particular, such residual crosstalk errors result in two non-trivial noise processes: every pair of data qubits that are connected by a shared ATS (hence aligned vertically) experiences a correlated Z error with probability pdouble and every triple of two data qubits and an ancilla qubit that measures an X stabilizer of the surface code experiences a correlated Z error with probability ptriple.

When g2/(2\u03c0)=2 MHz, the effects are very small. However, if g2/(270=3 MHz, the difference between logical Z error rates of the surface code with and without crosstalk errors is large enough such that one would need to use larger code distances to achieve the target logical failure rates for the algorithms as described herein. Hence, to maintain the overhead results, it would be preferable to use values of g2/(2\u03c0)=2 MHz since in such a case, effects from crosstalk errors are very small.",

In some cases, the maximum achievable g2 is fundamentally limited by 4J/(10\u03b1) due to the filter design and validity of adiabatic elimination. Here, 4J is the filter bandwidth which is given by 2\u03c0\u00d7100 MHz for 5 modes per ATS and 2\u03c0\u00d7180 MHz for 4 modes per ATS under the optimal choice of phononic mode frequencies. Hence, the maximum achievable g2/(2\u03c0) set by the filter design is given by 3.53 MHz and (6.36 MHz) for the setting with 5 and (4) modes per ATS. On the other hand, the crosstalk errors limit g2/(2\u03c0) to be bounded below 2 MHz (4 MHz). Thus, the crosstalk errors are currently a limiting factor and need to be further suppressed.",

The SBS code may be implemented using a bosonic architecture as described herein, such as system comprising mechanical resonators and multiplex control circuits, such as multiplexed ATSs. Each of the white boxes 1802 corresponds to an ATS. The darker grey squares (1804) and darker grey semi-circles (1806) correspond to Z-type gauge operators of the Bacon-Shor code portions of the SBS code. The lighter grey rectangles (1808) correspond to X-type gauge operators of surface code portions of the SBS code. The product of two X-type gauge operators between adjacent ATS's correspond to a stabilizer of the surface code. Data qubits are shown by the less densely hatched circles (1810). Ancilla qubits for the syndrome readout are shown by the more densely hatched circles (1812). The phononic readout modes are shown by the medium densely hatched circles. (1814). The white squares (1816) attached to the phononic readout modes show transom qubits associated with the phononic readout modes. The phononic readout mode (1814) can be used to directly measure the weight-two gauge operators. Ancilla qubits for the X-type gauge operators are initialized in the |+ state and measured in the X-basis. Ancilla qubits for the Z-type gauge operators are prepared in the |0 state and measured in the Z-basis. All the two-qubit gates (1818 for X-type gauge operators and 1820 for Z-type gauge operators) are CNOT gates. The numbers (1822) beside each operator indicate the time step in which it is applied.",
                                "In some embodiments, a hybrid Bacon-Shor surface code (SBS code) may reduce a number of modes coupled to an ATS, as compared to a traditional non-hybrid surface code. For example, a SBS code may only couple four phononic modes per ATS instead of five phononic modes per ATS as is the case for a traditional surface code. As discussed above in the section regarding Cross-Talk Mitigation Using Mode Frequency Optimization, having only four modes instead of five modes coupled to an ATS may reduce the probabilities of cross-talk, such as Type I, Type II, and Type III errors. Additionally, coupling fewer modes to an ATS may provide additional flexibility in selecting optimized frequencies and pump detunings to reduce Type III errors.",

Furthermore, \u03a0i=1dZi,jZi,j+1 is a Bacon-Shor type stabilizer whose eigenvalue is obtained by taking the product of the measured eigenvalue of weight-four and weight-two Z-type gauge operators along a vertical strip. It is noted that due to the non-commutation of Z and X-type gauge operators in the equation above for the gage groups (G), only stabilizer measurement outcomes are used to correct errors. The gate scheduling for the CNOT gates used to measure the gauge operators the equation above for the gage groups (G) are chosen to be symmetry in the bulk, which is contrary to the gate scheduling chosen in other Bacon Shor hybrid codes. Such a scheduling is chosen so that three parity measurements between the phononic readout mode and the transmon qubit can be implemented in one syndrome measurement cycle. The circuit for measuring the weight-two X-type gauge operators of the equation above for the gage groups (G) is shown in FIG. 20.",

Note that the CNOT gate scheduling is selected such that three (or more) parity measurements (2002) are performed in a given syndrome cycle before the phononic readout mode must be reset to the |+ state (2004).",
                                "Thin-stripped surface codes may require five modes per ATS to measure the surface code stabilizers. In particular, a crucial step when performing an X-basis measurement in a thin-stripped surface code is to swap ancillas (shown as the darker grey circles 1824) with other ancillas with associated transmons (e.g. ancillas 1814) (after all four CNOT gates have been applied) and perform repeated parity measurements between the ancillas (1814) and a transmon qubit (white square (1816) connected to the phononic readout mode ancilla (1814)).",

Such a reduction in the number of modes per ATS is shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B. For example in FIG. 19A the un-used phononic 1824 are highlighted and in FIG. 19B the unused phononic modes 1924 are omitted. In particular, due to the decomposition of the surface code stabilizers as a product of two weight-two X-type gauge operators in the equation above for the gage groups (G), the phononic readout mode can be used directly to measure such weight-two gauge operators. Furthermore, since the ancilla qubits for Z-type gauge operators are measured in the Z-basis, such measurements can be implemented directly without the use of a phononic readout. As such, all red vertices 1824 in FIGS. 18 and 19A can be removed as shown in FIG. 19B when implementing the SBS code.",
                                "As shown in the table discussed above with regard to the section Cross-Talk Mitigation Using Mode Frequency Optimization it can be seen that crosstalk errors are reduced by roughly one order of magnitude when only four modes are coupled to an ATS compared to five modes. As such, the hybrid Bacon-Shor surface code as described herein can correct both phase-flip and bit-flip errors while substantially reducing the effects of cross-talk errors as compared to the thin-stripped surface codes.",
                                "It is noted that other Bacon Shor surface codes may use flag qubits to measure the gauge operators of the code. However, the extra flag qubits and larger circuit depth required to measure such gauge operators contribute to an increase in logical failure rates for the same code parameters due to the larger number of fault locations. In contrast, the architecture proposed in this work has a circuit depth of 6 time steps compared to 11 time steps for measuring the stabilizers in other approached using flag qubits and does not require any flag qubits.

This at least in part because dynamical edge weight renormalization in each syndrome measurement round is not necessary when using a hybrid Bacon-Shor surface code (SBS code) as described herein."
