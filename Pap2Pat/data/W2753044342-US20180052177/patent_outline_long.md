## EXAMPLE 1: STUDY ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF BIOMARKERS OF DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY BY A METABOLOMIC APPROACH

### Materials and Methods

- select patients with epilepsy
- collect plasma samples
- prepare samples for NMR analysis
- acquire NMR spectra
- process NMR data
- normalize spectral data
- exclude regions with water signal and noise
