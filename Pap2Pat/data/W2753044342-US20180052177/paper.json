    "title": "Metabolomics As a Tool for the Characterization of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy",
    "date": "2017-09-04",
    "abstract": "Purpose: Drug resistance is a critical issue in the treatment of epilepsy, contributing to clinical emergencies and increasing both serious social and economic burdens on the health system. The wide variety of potential drug combinations followed by often failed consecutive attempts to match drugs to an individual patient may mean that this treatment stage may last for years with suboptimal benefit to the patient. Given these challenges it is valuable to explore the availability of new methodologies able to shorten the period of determining a rationale pharmacologic treatment. Metabolomics could provide such a tool to investigate possible markers of drug resistance insubjects with epilepsy. Methods:Blood samples were collected from: 1)controls (C) (n=35), 2)patients with epilepsy \u201cresponder\u201d(R) (n=18) and 3) patients with epilepsy \u201cnon-responder\u201d (NR) (n= 17) to the drug therapy. The samples were analysed using NMR spectroscopy, followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Key Findings: A different metabolic profile based on metabolomics analysis of the serum was observed between controls and patients with epilepsy, and also between responder and non-responder patients. It was possible to identify the discriminant metabolites for the 3 classes under investigation.Serum from patients with epilepsy were characterized by increased levels of 3-OH-butyrate, 2-OH-valerate, 2-OH-butyrate, acetoacetate, acetone, acetate, choline, alanine, glutamate, scyllo-inositol (CR>NR). Significance: In conclusion, metabolomics may represent an important tool for discovery of differences between subjects affected by epilepsy responding or resistant to therapies and for the study of its pathophysiology, optimizing the therapeutic resources and the quality of life of patients.",

                "Drug resistance is a critical issue in patients suffering from epilepsy. Indeed, a sufficient control of seizures is only obtained in half the population of patients with epilepsy, while in the remaining half, a subset of about 30% are classified as resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (1). Although still debated, the definition of \u201cdrug resistance in epilepsy\u201d can be broadly stated as \u201c\u2026a partial or no response to drugs that determines the presence of disabling seizures, which lead the affected individual to a significant neuropsychiatric and social impairment, lowering the quality of life, causing increased morbidity and higher risk of sudden death\u201d (2). Moreover, it is worth noting that such clinical failures in controlling seizures correspond to a severe economic impact given that 6,000,000 patients are estimated in Europe alone as having active epilepsy, with an annual cost of \u20ac 20 billion euro (3), plus the associated familiar and social excruciating burden. Perhaps, one of the less discussed problems is represented by the urgency of determining the correct combination of drugs to treat epilepsy or indeed whether there is a combination of drugs that do indeed work for a given patient. This problem is well illustrated by the fact that the pursuit of the most efficient AEDs can take years to even attempt the ideal combination (4). Moreover, since most of these patients can be eligible for non-pharmacological or resective treatment or vagal nerve stimulation (VNS\u00ae Cyberonics USA), there is an urgent need to find biomarkers that timely gage an individual\u2019s drug resistance. To investigate this issue, in the present study, we have applied a metabolomics approach to identify the metabolic profile of AEDs pharmacoresistance. Metabolomics is an effective postgenomics research tool that, through the metabolic study of biological fluids, has been applied to many disciplines including the study of human diseases, food control, and plant physiology (5\u20137). In addition, metabolomics has recently been used for studying several neurological diseases (8\u201310). The study of biofluids has been associated with the use of several analytical techniques of separation and detection, including gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (11\u201313). Depending on the instrument used to generate the metabolomics profile, a different panel of metabolites is obtained. In particular, NMR is characterized by lower sensitivity, but higher reproducibility and relatively easy quantification compared to MS analysis. Following this approach, the metabolic phenotype of an individual can be characterized according to how the individual\u2019s metabolism is influenced by many disparate factors such as genes, environment, nutrition, microbiota, and drugs. The application of metabolomics is an important step toward the understanding of the role that metabolic components have in disease and has been considered a real \u201cquantum leap\u201d advance in diagnosis, in staging, and, eventually, in categorizing different clusters of the same disease (14). On the basis of the results obtained in the present investigation, we suggest that the metabolomics approach is a viable new tool for neuroscience and in this case could help the clinician in the diagnosis of pharmacoresistance in epilepsy."

                        "Subjects affected by epilepsy, either pharmacologically controlled or pharmacoresistant, were enrolled from patients monitored in the Epilepsy Diagnostic and Treatment Centre of the University of Cagliari (Italy), along with matched healthy controls (Table 1). The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Hospital of Cagliari, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before inclusion. Subjects enrolled were not on ketogenic diet (KD).",
                        "As shown in Table 2, 17 individuals affected by drug-resistant, complex focal or generalized epilepsy were enrolled in the study. Among them, 15 subjects received AEDs in various combinations, while 2 in addition to AEDs had been implanted with a VNS device. The group of responders (R) was represented by 18 subjects, comparable with the AEDs-resistant group for type of seizures and mean age (Table 2) as well as for similar AEDs. Patients on monotherapy were not included in the study to better match the two epileptic groups. In subjects affected by focal seizures, the most probable type of seizure was determined both on the basis of reports from the patients themselves or from family members who witnessed events, as well as by ictal and interictal digital video-EEG and by 24-h EEG (Holter-EEG) recordings. On the basis of these criteria, the group of AEDs-resistant subjects included 6 patients with generalized epilepsy and 11 affected by focal seizures, while among the AEDs-responder patients, 6 suffered from generalized and 12 from focal seizures. No pathological signals were observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Small white matter altered microvascular spots were considered by neuroradiologist as age compatible (Table 2). The selection criteria included relative stability of clinical features related to interictal EEG activity, while the AEDs range in the serum was monthly assessed in optimal dosage in responder (R) and non-responder (NR) patients. The subjects affected by generalized and focal epilepsy were considered eligible if they had been monitored for more than 4\u2009years. Further selection criteria for inclusion in the study were as follows: (i) stable clinical symptomatology and EEG features from the last three months; (ii) normal neurological examination and psychiatric evaluations according to DSM-V; (iii) recent brain MRI negative for potentially epileptogenic alterations (stroke, tumors, MAV, infectious diseases); and (iv) AEDs treatment in both pharmacoresistant and R groups given at stable dose from at least 3\u2009months (Table 2). All selected patients did not receive KD. Seizure frequency occurrence was determined by the number of seizures reported in a personal diary (either by patient and/or caregivers). These data were standardized by considering the number of seizures during the 3-month period before the study; this period was arbitrarily selected (15). The selected subjects exhibited their first seizure between 8 and 26\u2009years of age, and the seizure frequency of the AEDs-resistant subjects ranged from 14 to 52 episodes in the trimester preceding the day of the metabolomics study, while the AEDs controlled group presented from 0 to a maximum of 4 seizures in the trimester preceding the study (Table 2).",

All procedures related to samples preparation and acquisition of the data were performed according to internal standard protocols, previously published (16). Serum samples were thawed and centrifuged at 2,500\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. An aliquot of 800\u2009\u00b5l of serum was used, and a solution of chloroform/methanol 1:1 (2,400\u2009\u00b5l) plus 350\u2009\u00b5l of distilled water was added. Samples were vortexed for 1\u2009min and centrifuged for 30\u2009min at 1,700\u2009g at RT. After the centrifugation, hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases were collected. The first was concentrated overnight using a speed vacuum instrument (Eppendorf concentrator plus, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) and then resuspended in 630\u2009\u00b5l of D2O and 70\u2009\u00b5l trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) 5.07\u2009mM (f.c.\u2009=\u20090.507\u2009mM). TSP was added to provide an internal reference for the chemical shifts of the spectrum obtained with the NMR analysis. Six hundred and fifty microliters of the solution were transferred into 5\u2009mm NMR tubes. NMR experiments were acquired with a Varian UNITY INOVA 500 spectrometer (Agilent technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) operating at 499\u2009MHz equipped with a 5\u2009mm triple resonance probe with z-axis pulsed field gradients and autosampler. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra were collected at 300\u2009K with a NOESY pulse sequence to suppress the residual signal of water by using 0.100\u2009ms of mixing time. Spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 6,000, 2\u2009Hz, acquisition time of 1.5\u2009s, relaxation delay of 2\u2009ms, 90\u00b0 pulse of 9.2\u2009\u00b5s, and number of scan of 256. Each free induction decay was zero-filled to 64K points and multiplied by a 0.5-Hz exponential line-broadening function. Spectra were manually phased, baseline corrected, and chemical shifts referred to the internal standard TSP (at \u03b4\u2009=\u20090.0\u2009ppm) using MestReNova software (version 8.1, Mestrelab Research S.L.

Multivariate statistical analysis was performed on the generated matrix using SIMCA-P\u2009+\u2009software (version 13.0, Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). NMR\u2019s variables were scaled using Pareto scaling. Initial data analyses were conducted using principal components analysis (PCA). Then partial least square discriminant analysis and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied. The quality of the model was assessed with two parameters: R2 and Q2 cumulative. R2 estimates goodness of fit and Q2 estimates goodness of prediction. Each mathematical model was validated by permutation test. This test was used to validate the model and to assess the degree of overfitting, by means of -n random permutations (n\u2009=\u2009500). The resulting plot displays the correlation coefficient between the original y-variable and the permuted y-variable vs the cumulative R2 and Q2, and the regression line. The scores values from each OPLS-DA model were subjected to CV-ANOVA to test the significance of the model, and the validation was considered successful with p\u2009<\u20090.05. Through the analysis of the S-plot, visualizing both the covariance and the correlation structure between the X-variables and the predictive score, and through the analysis of the set of VIPs (important variables on the projection), it was possible to identify the variables characterizing each class. These most significantly variables were quantified using Chenomx NMR Suite 7.1 and literature (17). A representative NMR spectrum showing the discriminate attribution is represented in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material. The concentrations were used to perform a non-parametric test, in particular, U-Mann\u2013Whitney test, followed by a Holm\u2013Bonferroni correction (GraphPad Prism software version 7.01, GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA)."

Univariate analysis using metabolite concentrations as variable was conducted on all groups.

                "The present study in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy shows that the concentrations of glucose, citrate, and lactate are decreased and ketone bodies (3-OH-butyrate, acetate, acetoacetate, and acetone) increased compared to R patients with epilepsy and controls. At first glance, our result appears in line with the observations that, in cases of refractory epilepsy, the energetic failure is reflected by uncompensated brain glucose levels (18). On the other hand, the increased concentrations of KBs in NR patients seem unexpected and at variance with the traditional studies that demonstrated the efficacy of the KD in controlling pharmacoresistant seizures (19). However, the key role of the KD, which represents the largest source of KBs, in the treatment of severe forms of infantile epilepsy (20) as well as in adult seizures (21, 22) is still challenging (23\u201325). According to our data, subjects affected by frequent and intractable seizures show an increase of KBs compared to patients pharmacologically controlled, despite being treated with similar dose of AEDs (Table 2). The reduction of citrate, glucose, and lactate concentrations in NR patients compared with R and C patients suggest a switch from glucose metabolism, the suitable energetic substrate of the brain, to ketogenic metabolites. Indeed, previous studies reported similar variations including a reduction in 13C-labeled citrate in an experimental seizure model in the hippocampus (26, 27). It is also worth noting that in these studies the concentrations of citrate and glucose showed a parallel decrease similar to the lactate profile. These observations suggest that in conditions of frequent/uncontrolled convulsions the biochemical response of the cellular machinery might be forced toward alternative energy resources such as those derived from KBs utilization. The antiseizure effects induced by KD suggest several mechanisms encompassing bioenergetics and mitochondrial changes (28), activity of cellular oxidation via poly-unsaturated fatty acids (29), and regulation of neuroprotective factors (30\u201332). Moreover, as glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), respectively, are the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain several studies focused their main issues on how KBs affect levels of these neurotransmitters and their receptor activity (33). Following magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigations, it has been demonstrated that increased levels of GABA neurotransmission are detected in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with KD (34, 35) underlining a possible action of ketone bodies upon the modulation of GABA-A receptors by increasing the synaptic inhibition (35, 36). The increase of synaptic inhibition might not be per se sufficient in contrasting AEDs-resistant epileptogenesis since the brain networks under sustained seizure activity show a poor affinity of GABA receptors (37, 38). Moreover, several alternative mechanisms for the KD effects have been proposed recently. The antiepileptic action of medium-chain triglyceride, a good source of KBs, has been widely documented (39, 40). Recently, Chang et al. demonstrate that medium-chain triglyceride, rich in decanoic acid, provides an antiseizure effect acting through direct AMPA receptor inhibition (41).",
                "Finally, the high production of KBs in patients with frequent seizure could be important to balance the increase of glutamate through the modification of the behavior of vesicular glutamate transporters (42). Together the effects of KBs emerge as a complex pleiotropic mechanism, which contains an apparent paradox: while the KBs are the most relevant part of a KD; nonetheless, their antiepileptic effects still needs to be proved (31). It seems possible to suggest that the increase of KBs in patients with epilepsy can be interpreted as an attempt to activate spontaneous biochemical processes aimed to optimize ultimate energetic resources.",
                "The results of the present study represent an interesting finding that can help the clinician in evaluating subjects affected by severe epilepsy as potential pharmacoresistant patients, thus prompting new investigations addressed to find alternative therapeutic solutions. However, several lines of criticism emerge in commenting the present data. Among them (i) we cannot rule out that the population of R and NR might show a metabolomic pattern related to the level of seizure control and drug sensitivity; (ii) despite supporting data also from the literature, we cannot point at the metabolomic profile as the sole predictor mechanism of anticonvulsant effects, given the manifold players of epileptogenesis and pharmacoresistance (43, 44); (iii) there are no sufficient data that a possible seizure control might reverberate in a given metabolomic pattern; (iv) the metabolomic profile described in the present study has been derived from a single sample of each individual, while possible variations (e.g., related with seizure frequency or time of seizure) can be better assessed by multiple samples.",
                "In conclusion, the results suggest that metabolomic can help to better understand some aspects of pharmacoresistant epilepsy and contribute to target some peculiar biochemical mechanisms involved in the epileptogenesis. A larger cohort of selected patients affected by drug-resistant epilepsy and a multicentric carefully planned study are needed to validate the present findings."
