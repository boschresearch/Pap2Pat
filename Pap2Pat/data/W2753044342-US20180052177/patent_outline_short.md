# DESCRIPTION

- introduce problem of drug-resistant epilepsy
- motivate need for new approach to identify drug-resistant epilepsy
- describe metabolomics as effective post-genomic research tool
- summarize study of metabolic profiles of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
- interpret results of study in terms of cerebral metabolism
- describe method for in vitro identification of drug-resistant epilepsy
- outline use of metabolites as biomarkers of drug-resistant epilepsy

## EXAMPLE 1: STUDY ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF BIOMARKERS OF DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY BY A METABOLOMIC APPROACH

### Materials and Methods

- collect plasma samples
- prepare and acquire NMR data
- process and analyze NMR data

### Results

- perform PCA analysis
- build OPLS-DA models
- validate models with permutation test
- identify and quantify metabolites
- perform multivariate and univariate analysis
