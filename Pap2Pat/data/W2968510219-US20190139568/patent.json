Large spin Hall angles (0) have been discovered in solids ranging from the simple SOC solids: platinum (\u03b8=0.08), tantalum (\u03b8=0.15), and tungsten (\u03b8=0.30) to topological insulators: Bi2Se3 (\u03b8=2.0-3.5) and BiSbTe3.

                        "Tungsten (W) has the largest spin Hall angle (0.3) among transition metals. The preparation of W has been developed to be compatible with modern semiconductor fabrication processes. W metallization processing is widely used for very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) circuits, and the stable and conductive \u03b1-W is more commonly used in semiconductor processing than \u03b2-W. See, Petroff et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 44, 2545 (1973). Structures of \u03b2-W/ferromagnetic thin film (FM) resulting in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) have not previously been obtained. For MRAM and SLD applications, PMA is required for high performance. The common practice of inserting a hafnium layer (e.g. \u03b2-W/Hf/FM) to encourage PMA has the deleterious effects of lowering the effective spin Hall angle and increasing fabrication complexity. See, Pai et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 082407 (2014).",
                        "\u03b2-W has not been well studied in the context of GSHE, for example, the intrinsic spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in bulk \u03b2-W previously remained undefined. The spin Hall angle dependency on \u03b2-W thin film thickness has not previously been measured and studied. Further, much effort has previously been spent to stabilize \u03b2-W. There is a need to develop methods of fabrication of stable \u03b2-W thin films that have a broad range of thicknesses and which simultaneously exhibit GSHE."

The \u03b2-W remains intact below a critical thickness (tc) of 22.1 nm, even after magnetic thermal annealing at 280\u00b0 C., which induces PMA in the stacked structure. Results of x-ray diffraction data herein are evidence of \u03b2-W structure after magnetic thermal annealing for the range of thicknesses from about 3.0 nm to about 22.1 nm. See, FIG. 6 and FIG. 7A. \u03b2-W with a thickness greater than the spin diffusion length (3.5 nm to 4.3 nm) and less than 22.1 nm was observed to remain in n-form after annealing. The crystalline grain size of the annealed 13-W thin films is larger than the spin diffusion length (3.5 nm to 4.3 nm). See, FIG. 7B. The resistivity of annealed \u03b2-W was observed to be nearly constant at a range of thicknesses and at temperatures in a range of 10 K and 300 K. See, FIG. 8A. The relatively constant resistivity over such a wide temperature range and thickness range is desirable for spintronics application, since the magnetic switching power from the GSHE would be less sensitive to temperature.",

As a result of GSHE in \u03b2-W, the critical current density for the STT induced magnetic switching in CoFeB was observed to have been reduced in the Examples herein.

During preparation, the base pressure was set at less than 2\u00d710\u22128 Torr and the Ar sputtering pressure was set at about 2.2 mTorr. For each sample, the stack was sequentially deposited in the order of W/CoFeB/MgO/Ta. The Ta layer which had a thickness of 1 nm was a capping layer or overlayer to prevent oxidation of the active layers by the atmosphere.",

For formation of \u03b2-W, a low DC sputtering power of 3 W was applied intermittently to keep the deposition rate less than 0.02 nm/s. Multiple stacks were prepared, each with W at a thickness in the range of the 2.5 to 26.7 nm. These stacks were patterned using photolithography into standard Hall bars with areas of 20\u00d755 \u03bcm2 for measurements of Hall Effect and resistivity. The stacks were annealed at 280\u00b0 C. for one minute with two hours of ramping up and six hours of natural cooling in a vacuum at 1\u00d710\u22126 Torr, and a magnetic field of 0.45 Tesla was applied perpendicular to the plane of the stacks. Magnetotransport measurements were performed on these stacks using an electromagnet at room temperature. The preparation parameters above can be further optimized. For example, the sputtering power is increased to reduce thin film deposition time. The annealing time including ramping up/down and duration at the fixed temperature can be reduced to increase the throughput of the annealing process. The magnetic field can be selected in a range including 0.45 Tesla, and the annealing temperature can be selected from a range including about 280\u00b0 C.",

FIG. 1 is a graph of the value of Rk as a function of W thickness in the range of 2.5 nm to 7.0 nm. The solid line is the best fit to the data based on resistivities of \u03c1W which was observed to be about 209 \u03bc\u03a9-cm and \u03b2FeCoB which was observed to be about 80 \u03bc\u03a9-cm.

An external magnetic field (Bext) was applied in the YZ plane with an angle \u03b2 between the field and Y-axis. The resulting magnetization vector (M) was observed in the YZ plane at an angle \u03b8 from the Y-axis.",

The square hysteresis loops for each sample in FIG. 2B revealed PMA in the W/CoFeB without an insertion layer between W and CoFeB. The switching field, or coercivity Hc, was varied from 5 Oe to 22 Oe. The square-shaped loops for each W thickness indicate that CoFeB exhibited PMA for each sample at each W thickness.

The bi-stable states of M (up and down) are accessible by cycling current in both directions through a critical value (Ic), under either a positive or negative Bext. See, FIG. 2C and FIG. 2D. Critical current (Ic) was defined as the average of the positive and negative switching current.

Thermal annealing of the \u03b2-W films resulted in a lower switch current density compared to the \u03b2-W films prior to annealing indicating thermal annealing is useful for materials used in spintronic MRAM and SLD. See, Hao et al., Applied Physics Letters 106, 182403 (2015), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Results herein show that films having a thickness up to 22.1 nm remained in the \u03b2 phase through the annealing process, and films with a thickness greater than 22.1 nm were transformed into a phase by the annealing process. Therefore, the thickness of \u03b2-W films that were magnetic thermal annealed for use in spintronic devices was observed to have been greater than the spin diffusion length (\u03bbsf) of 3.5 nm to 4.3 nm and less than 22.1 nm to have maximized GSHE in \u03b2-W films.",

For the formation of \u03b2-W, a low DC sputtering power of 3 W was applied intermittently to keep the deposition rate constant at 0.02 nm/s. The films were patterned into standard Hall bars using photolithography for spin Hall effect and resistivity measurements, with the longitudinal dimensions of 20\u00d755 \u03bcm2 in area.

For \u03b1-W thin films, RH(300 K) was observed to be \u22121.91\u00d710\u22129 \u03a9-cm/T which is equal to \u22121.91\u00d710\u221211 m3/C, consistent with prior studies of \u03b1-W thin films. See, Bastl, Thin Solid Films 10, 311-313 (1972). RH(T) was observed to change signs from negative to positive as temperature was reduced below 130 K, indicating a competition between electron and hole carriers from multi-bands in \u03b1-W thin films. The spin Hall effect data presented in FIG. 9 is evidence of the effects of band structure, scattering mechanisms, and surface electronic states of \u03b2-W and \u03b1-W thin films incorporating the strong SOC. Small amounts of oxygen in \u03b2-W or \u03b1-W thin films were observed to affect temperature dependence of the spin Hall effect.",

After annealing, Co40Fe40B20 was observed to develop PMA as the W layer remained in \u03b2-phase. See, Hao et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 3, 034009 (2015).",
                                "FIG. 10 is a graph of the magnetic switching of the Co40Fe40B20 (1.0 nm) layer by the spin current generated in the \u03b2-W layer (6.0 nm). Switching was detected by measuring the anomalous Hall effect of the Co40Fe40B20 (1.0 nm) layer. Under an in-plane magnetic field of 2 mT, the sample W(6.0 nm)/Co40Fe40B20 (1.0 nm)/MgO(1.6 nm)/Ta(1.0 nm) was observed in FIG. 10 to be magnetically switched with a critical current (Ic) of 2.2 mA, corresponding to a critical current density (JC) of 1.2\u00d7106 A/cm2 in the W layer, about an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained in other similar structures.

                                "In general, \u03b2-W thin films that are embodiments of the invention provided herein were fabricated using a magnetron sputtering process. The as-deposited films were observed to be in \u03b2-W phase from 3.0 nm to 26.7 nm. In order to obtain PMA in layered structures of \u03b2-W/Co40Fe40B20/MgO, high vacuum thermal magnetic annealing was performed at a temperature of 280\u00b0 C. After annealing, \u03b2-W phase was observed to have been transformed into \u03b1-W phase at a critical thickness of greater than 22.1 nm, which is larger than the spin diffusion length of 3.5 nm for \u03b2-W thin films. The stabilization of \u03b2-W up to 22.1 nm after annealing was observed to be capable of exploiting the full GSHE in 1-W thin films. In the films provided herein, the typical grain size was observed to be about one third to one half of the thin film thickness. The room temperature resistivity of the bulk \u03b2-W film was observed to be about 195 \u03bc\u03a9-cm and the electron mean free path was observed to be about 0.45 nm.",
                                "The resistivity of \u03b2-W was observed to be nearly insensitive to factors of temperature and thickness. At 14.5 nm, the temperature coefficient of resistivity was observed to be almost zero in the range of 10 K to 360 K. This property is highly desirable for spintronics applications because the magnetic switching power from GSHE does not depend on temperature. The normal Hall coefficient for f-W thin films was measured between 10 K and 300 K. The Hall coefficient for the \u03b2-W thin films was observed to have the same magnitude as bulk \u03b1-W, and have a negative sign. Using the sputtering and magnetic thermally annealing process herein, PMA and low switching current density was observed in a layered structure of \u03b2-W/Co40Fe40B20/MgO."
