    "title": "Protective Activity of the CnaBE3 Domain Conserved among Staphylococcus aureus Sdr Proteins",
    "date": "2013-09-17",
    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen, commensal of the human skin and nares, but also responsible for invasive nosocomial as well as community acquired infections. Staphylococcus aureus adheres to the host tissues by means of surface adhesins, such as SdrC, SdrD, and SdrE proteins. The Sdr family of proteins together with a functional A domain, contain respectively two, three or five repeated sequences called B motifs which comprise the CnaB domains. SdrD and SdrE proteins were reported to be protective in animal models against invasive diseases or lethal challenge with human clinical S. aureus isolates. In this study we identified a 126 amino acid sequence containing a CnaB domain, conserved among the three Sdr proteins. The three fragments defined here as CnaBC2, D5 and E3 domains even though belonging to phylogenetically distinct strains, displayed high sequence similarity. Based on the sequence conservation data, we selected the CnaBE3 domain for further analysis and characterization. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant CnaBE3 domain recognized SdrE, SdrC and SdrD proteins of different S. aureus lineages. Moreover, we demonstrated that the CnaBE3 domain was expressed in vivo during S. aureus infections, and that immunization of this domain alone significantly reduces the bacterial load in mice challenged with S. aureus. Furthermore, we show that the reduction of bacteria by CnaBE3 vaccination is due to functional antibodies. Finally, we demonstrated that the region of the SdrE protein containing the CnaBE3 domain was resistant to trypsin digestion, a characteristic often associated with the presence of an isopeptide bond.",

                "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram positive opportunistic pathogen associated with asymptomatic colonization of the skin and mucosal surfaces. This microorganism is responsible for infections in humans and animals, ranging from mild localized impetigo and cellulitis, to life threatening systemic infections such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome and gastroenteritis [1]. S. aureus is one of the most important causes of nosocomial (catheters and implants) and community acquired infections [2,3], and being a reservoir of multiple antibiotic resistance genes, favors the rapid spread of drug resistant isolates, such as methicillin resistant strains (MRSA) [4,5]. Overall the incidence of staphylococcal diseases has increased over the past ten years [6], supporting the importance of developing a vaccine that can prevent life-threatening infections [7,8].",
                "As many other microbial pathogens, S. aureus adheres to the host tissues by means of MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), which recognize fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, and heparin related polysaccharides and are responsible for the initial contact with host cells [9]. Sdr (derived from the repetition of amino acid serine \u2013S- and aspartic acid \u2013D-) are MSCRAMM proteins involved in adherence to epithelial cells [10,11], and structurally related to a family of cell wall anchored proteins known as ClfA and ClfB (clumping factor A and B) [12].",
                "The sdr locus encodes three proteins, SdrC, SdrD, and SdrE, each of them composed of a putative leader peptide sequence at the N-terminus, followed by an A domain and by two, three, or five 110-113 residue repeated sequences (for SdrC, SdrE, and SdrD, respectively), called B repeats containing the CnaB domains. These domains are hypothesized to function as spacers which regulate the distance between the interactive A domain and the surface of the bacteria. The C-terminal region of the Sdr proteins contain the SD repeat domain composed of 132-170 S-D residues, followed by an LPXTG motif [12] (see Figure 1A).",
                "In 2006, Stranger-Jones and colleagues demonstrated that immunization with a four antigen combination containing SdrD and SdrE proteins was able to generate significant protective immunity against invasive disease or lethal challenge with human clinical S. aureus isolates in a kidney abscess and/or in a lethal mouse animal model [7].",
                "In this paper, following sequence analysis of the three Sdr proteins of the S. aureus Newman strain, we identified a 126 amino acid sequence conserved among the three Sdr proteins, with a sequence identity comprised between 94 and 97%. Since the identified fragments encompassed the second, the third and fifth B repeat of SdrC, SdrD, and SdrE respectively, we termed them as CnaBC2, D5 and E3 domains. We report significant sequence similarity among Sdr full length proteins especially among their CnaB domains, even when belonging to phylogenetically distinct strains. Based on the conservation data we selected CnaBE3 domain for further analysis. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant CnaBE3 domain were able to recognize all the three full length Sdr proteins belonging to the same panel of S. aureus lineages. Moreover, ELISA experiments performed using patient or healthy donor sera showed that a specific immune response against CnaBE3 domain was raised during S. aureus infections. Furthermore, mice immunized with the CnaBE3 domain showed a significant reduction in bacterial load, when challenged intravenously with either Newman strain (SdrE positive strain) or the NCTC8325 strain (SdrE negative, but SdrC and SdrD positive strain). These data strongly suggest that the sequence similarity shared by CnaB domains E3, C2 and D5 was sufficient to promote cross protection in a mouse model of kidney abscess formation. Finally, we showed that mice vaccinated with CnaBE3 vaccination produced functional anti-CnaBE3 antibodies, able to mediate the killing of the S. aureus Newman bacteria by differentiated HL-60 cells. Interestingly, the region of the SdrE protein containing the CnaBE3 domain was resistant to trypsin digestion, a characteristic often associated with the presence of an isopeptide bond. However, the analysis of two different constructs containing CnaBE3 domain has not revealed thus far the presence of intramolecular isopeptide bonds."

                        "As previously reported, SdrE and SdrD proteins are known to be protective against S. aureus infection in a mouse model of kidney abscess formation [7]. Therefore, we hypothesized that a shared component of the two related proteins could be responsible for the protection; hence, sequence analysis of the three Sdr proteins of the S. aureus Newman strain was performed. We identified a 126 amino acid conserved sequence present in all the three Sdr proteins. The amino acid identity ranged between 94 and 97%, whereas the sequence identity obtained by comparing the three full length proteins never exceeded 43% (Table 1). The identified polypeptides, located adjacently to the SD region, contained a CnaB domain, and encompassed the second, the third and fifth B repeat of SdrC, SdrE, and SdrD respectively (Figure 1 A and B). Therefore we decided to name these fragments respectively as CnaBC2, D5 and E3 domains. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the Sdr proteins and the CnaBC2, D5 and E3 domains of the Newman strain to a panel of clinical S. aureus isolates, showed high sequence similarity and conservation both among Sdr full length proteins and more specifically among their CnaB domains, even when belonging to phylogenetically distinct strains (Figure 2A). In fact, when considering CnaB domains, the percent identity was never below 95%. Remarkably, even in strains lacking sdrD (MRSA252) or sdrE genes (NCTC8325) the comparison with Newman CnaB domains, revealed a high percentage of amino acid sequence identity, due to the similarity of the lacking CnaB domains (CnaBD5 or CnaBE3) with those still present (e.g. CnaBC2) in these two genomes (Figure 2B).",
                        "We decided to further characterize the CnaBE3 domain, because SdrE is a reported virulence factor in invasive S. aureus infections [13], and it was found to be protective against S. aureus challenge in mice [7]."

As shown in Figure 3, the anti-CnaBE3 polyclonal antibodies recognized all the three Sdr proteins in all the protein extracts. As expected, neither protein SdrD in the sdrD negative strain MRSA252, nor protein SdrE in the sdrE negative strain NCTC8325 was detected.

Additionally a panel of 46 sera collected from healthy donors was used as control. As shown in Figure 4, anti-CnaBE3 IgG titers of sera collected from the patients were significantly higher than those of sera collected from healthy donors (p\u22640.05). These data suggested that, even though up to 80% of the healthy population is a permanent (20%) or intermittent (60%) carrier of S. aureus, a specific immune response against CnaBE3 fragment was indeed raised during S. aureus infections."

                        "The protective efficacy of the CnaBE3 domain was assessed in a mouse model of kidney abscess formation [7]. As reported in Figure 5A, immunization with the full length SdrE protein or the CnaBE3 domain reduced the bacterial load (as measured by CFU\u2019s) in the kidneys of one logarithm, as compared to the negative control group (alum 4.27 x 106 CFUs, SdrE 1.48 x 105 CFUs, CnaBE3 3.89 x 105 CFUs). Notably, no differences were observed between the bacterial load reductions obtained using either the CnaBE3 domain or the full length protein, suggesting that the bacterial CFU reduction observed in this latter group could be mainly due to the presence of an immune response raised against the CnaBE3 polypeptide. To further confirm that this domain was sufficient to induce a significant (p\u22640.05) reduction in bacterial load and to evaluate the cross protection activity of CnaBE3 domain against SdrC or SdrD proteins, mice immunized with CnaBE3 domain were challenged using the S. aureus strain NCTC8325, which is naturally defective for the sdrE gene. As shown in panel B of Figure 5, mice immunization with CnaBE3 domain caused a significant CFU reduction in bacterial load in kidneys (2.63 x 105 CFUs), when compared to mice immunized with Alum alone (1.48 x 106 CFUs) (p\u22640.01)."

HL-60 cells killed 20% of Newman cells in the presence of anti-CnaBE3 serum and 30% in the presence of anti-SdrE serum, whereas no killing of the Newman strain was observed in the presence of the preimmune serum or in absence of either complement or cells (Figure 6). Of note, there was no difference observed between the percentages of OPK activity obtained using either the CnaBE3 domain or the full length protein, suggesting again that the killing of Newman cells mediated by the SdrE antiserum, could be mainly due to the CnaBE3 antibodies."

                        "To further characterize the CnaBE3 domain as a putative vaccine candidate, we investigated its biochemical and structural properties. The CnaB domains of Gram positive pilus proteins contain intramolecular isopeptide bond, which confers resistance to enzymatic digestion [14]. Since Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) experiments demonstrated that calcium stabilizes SdrE protein (Figure S1), to rule out a possible influence of calcium in resistance to trypsin digestion, SdrE protein was dialyzed against CaCl2 or EDTA, and then subjected to trypsin digestion. As shown in Figure 7A, the overnight trypsin digestion resulted in one major band of 37 kDa in both conditions. The deduced N-terminal sequence of the trypsin resistant fragment was T-P-K-Y-S-L-G-D-Y-V corresponding to amino acid 785-793 of the recombinant protein SdrE and to amino acid 14-23 of the CnaBE3 domain (Figures 7B and 1B). Moreover, peptide mass fingerprint of the trypsin resistant fragment encompassed the region of the SdrE protein containing the CnaBE3 domain (peptides identified starting from amino acid 788 to amino acid 846 of the recombinant SdrE protein) (Figure 7B and 7C). The data are in agreement with the results from Edman degradation and with the apparent molecular weight observed in SDS-PAGE. In fact, no tryptic cleavage sites (K, R) are present in the SD repeat domain, which is located in the C-terminal part of the protein, immediately downstream to the CnaBE3 domain (Figure 7B). Therefore, we hypothesized that the CnaBE3 domain contains isopeptide bonds conferring resistance to trypsin digestion. Intact mass spectrometry analysis of the CnaBE3 did not demonstrate the loss of ~ 17 Da, as expected in the presence of an isopeptide bond (data not shown). These data indicated that the CnaBE3 domain does not assume a conformation compatible with the establishment of an isopeptide bond, without ruling out the hypothesis that this bond may occur in the full length protein."

                "Several MSCRAMMs have been thus far identified [9,15,16], among them the Staphylococcus aureus collagen-binding Cna, which contains a B region, that acts as a structural protein to expose the functional A region outside the bacterial cell. This B region is composed of a variable number of repeated sequences called CnaB domains, and displays an inverse IgG like fold [17]. Many CnaB-type proteins have been characterized in a number of bacterial species. In 1998, Josefsson and colleagues identified S. aureus Sdr proteins [12], which are involved in adherence to epithelial cells [10,11], contain putative CnaB domains [12], and have been reported to be protective against S. aureus infection [7].",
                "In this report, we demonstrated that a newly identified polypeptide of 126 amino acids, shared by the three Sdr proteins and containing a CnaB domain, was important in inducing a significant (p\u22640.05 and p\u22640.01) bacterial load reduction in animal model of S. aureus infection. A sequence conservation analysis showed low sequence identity among Sdr full length proteins of the S. aureus Newman strain (max 43% identity), while the sequence identity of their CnaB domains (CnaBC2, CnaBD5 and CnaBE3) ranged between 94 and 97%. Accordingly, the B repeats adjacent to the SD region of each Sdr protein were reported to share a high sequence identity [12]. Interestingly, the B motifs of the Sdr proteins display some sequence similarity to the B repeats of the collagen binding protein Cna of S. aureus [12]. Of note, the sequence of the third B repeat of the SdrE protein shows similarities with subdomain D1 of the CnaB1 domain of the S. aureus protein Cna, suggesting a putative extension of the sequence of CnaB domain of the third B repeat [17] (Figure S2 panel A and B). Of interest, this 126 amino acid polypeptide presents sequence similarities with CnaB domains identified in other species such as Streptococcus agalactiae, pyogenes and pneumoniae. These data led us to analyze the conservation of the three CnaB domains in a panel of eleven S. aureus strains, on the basis of their Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) [18-21]. The conservation analysis of Sdr proteins and their CnaB domains showed that CnaBE3, CnaBD5 and CnaBC2 domains were highly conserved among the selected S. aureus strains, even with the absence of sdrE in strain NCTC8325 and of sdrD in strain MRSA252 (see Figure 2B). Several types of insertion and deletion have been found both in sdrC and sdrD genes of bovine, ovine and human isolates suggesting horizontal gene transfer as a means for variability. However, deletions of the region containing C2 or D5 domains and mutations in the sdrE gene have not yet been described [22], suggesting a stability of these Sdr regions. Interestingly, Xue and coworkers reported an higher conservation of sdrE gene (respect to sdrC or sdrD) in the two main phylogenetic clusters of S. aureus sdr genes analyzed [22]. Of these three genes, only sdrC is present in all S. aureus strains currently tested [13,23]. Due to the phylogenetic stability of the SdrE protein [22], we selected CnaBE3 domain for further analysis.",
                "Analysis of protein expression in the eleven strains revealed that anti-CnaBE3 antibodies were able to detect the three Sdr proteins in the cell surface extracts of each strain tested; suggesting that these antibodies could recognize S. aureus strains lacking the sdrE gene. The three sdr genes were demonstrated to be transcribed as three separate transcripts regulated by environmental changes. It is reported that magnesium and calcium ions enhanced the expression of all sdr genes, especially sdrC, at different growth phases [24]. Of note, each B motif of the Sdr proteins contains a consensus Ca2+ binding EF-hand loop (see Figure S2), reported to be functional in the five B repeats of SdrD protein, which promote a compact conformation of the protein [25]. Our results demonstrate clearly that the full length protein SdrE is stabilized by the uptake of Ca2+ ions.",
                "Data from ELISA provide evidence that sera from patients with S. aureus infections recognize the CnaBE3 domain when compared with sera from healthy donors, suggesting that CnaBE3 is expressed during S. aureus infections. It is noteworthy that sera collected from a healthy population recognize the CnaBE3 domain. This is probably due to the fact that up to 80% of the healthy population has been a carrier of S. aureus [26,27]. Interestingly, Dryla and colleagues reported a significantly higher IgG level against SdrD protein in the sera from acute phase S. aureus infected patients, when compared with healthy donors [28]. This suggests that SdrD was expressed early during disease and recognized by the immune system [28].",
                "Both SdrD and SdrE full length proteins have been previously reported as protective antigens in combination with two other vaccine candidates [7]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that SdrD protein is instrumental in the process of abscess formation [29]. Our results indicate that, in a renal abscess formation mouse model, immunization with CnaBE3 domain provides a significant reduction of the bacterial load, when challenged with S. aureus, with the same efficacy as the full length SdrE protein.",
                "Moreover, immunization with the CnaBE3 domain, whose sequence is conserved and widespread in S. aureus, showed similar results when challenged with strain NCTC8325 (defective for the sdrE gene), implying that CnaBE3 antibodies could recognize SdrC and/or SdrD proteins. The OPK data showed that anti-CnaBE3 antibodies mediated opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus, suggesting that the observed bacterial load reduction was, at least partially, antibody mediated, as reported for antibodies raised against other S. aureus antigens [30,31].",
                "The CnaB domains identified in Gram positive pilus proteins have been described to contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds [14,32-38], conferring resistance to enzymatic digestion; however, isopeptide bonds within putative CnaB domains of Sdr proteins have yet to be reported. Of note, the SdrE protein was identified only when subject to harsh preparation in an exoproteome analysis; this feature has previously been observed for pilus proteins of  Streptococcus  species (Nathalie Norais, personal communication). Our results show that no isopeptide bond was identified in the CnaBE3 domain; nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis that the formation of an isopeptide bond may occur in the SdrE full length protein, expressed as a different construct or in vivo by S. aureus [39,40].",
                "Despite the introduction of new antibiotics, mortality, morbidity, and cost from invasive S. aureus infections remain high [41], supporting the rational to develop a vaccine to prevent diseases caused by S. aureus [7,8,41,42]. Optimal vaccine antigens should be immunogenic, expressed by the majority of clinical S. aureus isolates, and should elicit antibodies that promote opsonophagocytic killing [42].",
                "Our data suggest the CnaBE3 domain as a possible vaccine candidate, supported by the high conservation of the CnaBE3 sequence and by its immunogenicity and expression during S. aureus infections. Functional domains, which interact with host ligands, are generally considered as promising vaccine candidates. However, the most variable protein domains are the putative functional regions, which undergo selective pressure in order to circumvent the host immune system reaction [43]. On the contrary, domains such as CnaBE3 are well conserved, due to their importance in maintaining the structure of the protein. As previously shown by other groups, antigen combinations can confer greater protection than single antigens in vaccine formulations [7,44]. Hence, CnaBE3 would have to be included in a multicomponent vaccine, even as a fusion protein, along with other comprising toxoids and antigens that target the complexity and different stages of the pathogenesis of S. aureus diseases."

The sequences of Sdr proteins and CnaB domains from the different strains were then aligned with clustalW [51], using default options and manually inspected for ambiguously aligned regions. Alignments reported in Table 1, Figure 1, and in Figure S2 were performed using clustal Omega [52,53], using default options and manually inspected for ambiguously aligned regions."

S. aureus mid exponential phase cultures were grown in TSB supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2 to OD600 = 0.6. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 100 \u00b5l Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5) supplemented with 30% raffinose, and 1X EDTA free protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche). 8 \u00b5g of lysostaphin (Sigma-Aldrich) were applied to the mix for 10 min at 37\u00b0C to harvest cell wall proteins. Extracts were centrifuged at 6,000 xg for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatants containing cell wall extracts were boiled for 10 min with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and NuPAGE Sample Reducing Agent (Life Technologies) and separated in 3-8% NuPAGE Tris-Acetate Gels (Invitrogen). Electrophoretically separated protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) with iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked, 2 hr on a shaker incubator (25\u00b0C, 700 rpm), in 10% skim milk (Bio-Rad) in TPBS (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4). After three washes in TPBS, mouse polyclonal anti-CnaBE3 diluted 1:1,000 in 1% skim milk in TPBS was added and membranes were incubated for 1 hr (25\u00b0C, 700 rpm). Membranes were washed three times in TPBS and polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins-HRP (Dako) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% skim milk in TPBS was added.

                        "ELISA procedures were performed as already reported [54] with minor modifications. Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp\u00ae flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated (100 \u00b5l per well) overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2 \u00b5g/ml of CnaBE3 protein in PBS. The plates were washed three times with TPBS and blocked with 200 \u00b5l per well of Blocking Buffer containing 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Human test sera from patients affected by Staphylococcus aureus, from healthy adults, and from healthy infants were initially diluted 1:100 in Dilution Buffer (1% BSA in TPBS) added in duplicate to the wells (100 \u00b5l per well), and serially two-fold diluted. After 2 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C, the plates were washed three times with TPBS, then Dilution Buffer containing goat anti-human IgG (\u03bb-chain specific) alkaline phosphatase conjugate antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:2,000 was added 100 \u00b5l per well. Following 1hr and 30 min incubation at 37\u00b0C, the plates were washed three times with TPBS, and 100 \u00b5l per well of a solution of DEA buffer (1M diethanolamine, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 9.8) containing 3 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) were applied. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by adding 100 \u00b5l 4N NaOH. Optical densities (ODs) at 405 nm were measured using SpectraMax 190 Absorbance Microplate Reader supplied with SoftMax\u00ae Pro Data Acquisition & Analysis Software (Molecular Devices). To calculate the serum titers and correct experimental variability, two wells per plate received only Dilution Buffer (blank wells), and a standard serum was assayed in parallel with the other sera on each plate. The blank wells were used as negative control and the mean of their OD405 nm reading was subtracted from all the sample OD405 nm readings. To every two-fold dilution point of the standard serum, made by pooling same volumes of sera highly responsive to CnaBE3, was assigned a value of Arbitrary Units (AU). The first dilution in the linear range of response which gave an OD405 nm <= 2.5 was given 1,000 AU, then 500 AU, 250 AU, 125 AU, 62.5 AU from the second to the fifth two-fold dilution point. The standard curve was fitted to a function, which was used to convert the absorbance of sera dilutions into AU [28,55,56]. Sera dilution points with OD405 nm >= 0.2 and <= 2.5 were considered in the calculation. Each AU value from each dilution point of a serum was multiplied by the reverse of the corresponding dilution (normalized AU) and the final AU value was calculated as the mean of the normalized AU values of the serum. Every serum was run in duplicate and final AUs were the mean of the AUs of both duplicate samples. Samples that did not fall within an acceptable OD405 nm range were re-tested at an alternate dilution. ELISA AU values were natural logarithm transformed to more closely approximate a normal distribution (lnAU). Each experiment was performed in duplicate. The statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test."

Negative control groups consisted of mice immunized with adjuvant alone.

Newman strain grown overnight in TSB 2% NaCl2, was washed once in PBS, and then incubated with serum (75,000 CFU/well) at 4\u00b0C for 20 minutes. Differentiated HL-60 cells were distributed at 3.7 \u00d7 106 per well (HL-60: bacteria ratio, 50:1) and rabbit complement was added at 10% final concentration. At this point, samples were diluted in H2O + tween 0.05% in order to completely lyse HL-60 cells, and plated onto TSA plates to enumerate the number of colonies (Time 0). Contemporary, a replica of the same samples was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, under agitation at 600 rpm. The reaction was stopped by putting the plate on ice, and samples were diluted in H2O + tween 0.05% and plated for CFU count determination (Time 1). The killing percentage was calculated using the following formula: [(Time 0 \u2013 Time 1)/Time 0] * 100, where Time 0 is the number of colonies before the incubation and Time 1 is the number of colonies after 1 hour of incubation."
