# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- describe ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment

## SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

- motivate cancer immunotherapies
- describe limitations of traditional immunotherapies
- summarize existing ovarian cancer immunotherapies
- introduce remission-stage vaccines

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Definitions

- define section headings
- incorporate publications by reference
- describe conventional techniques
- define singular and plural forms
- define transition terms
- define optional circumstances
- define numerical designations
- define about and substantially
- define animal and subject
- define composition and pharmaceutical composition

### Therapeutic Methods and Kits

- define therapeutic methods
- describe cancer treatment methods
- outline immune response triggering methods
- specify kit composition and use
- provide additional embodiments and variations

### Compositions

- define vaccine composition
- describe antigen composition
- describe CPMV particle composition
- describe pharmaceutical composition
- outline manufacturing process
- describe administration routes
- outline dosages and dosing regimens

### Experimental Methods

- prepare tumor cells in four ways
- compare CPMV to MPLA and DMXAA as adjuvants
- administer vaccines and challenge with live tumor cells
- measure survival and observe immune response
- test CPMV with different tumor cell preparations
- evaluate vaccine efficacy with and without adjuvants
- confirm requirement of both antigen and adjuvant for vaccine efficacy

### Results

- CPMV is an effective adjuvant when combined with irradiated syngeneic ovarian cancer cells

### Discussion

- motivate need for patient-centered immunotherapies
- introduce CPMV and irradiated murine ovarian cancer cells as effective vaccine
- compare different tumor preparations and adjuvants
- discuss T cell-dependent immunological mechanism
- suggest application of remission-stage ovarian cancer vaccines
