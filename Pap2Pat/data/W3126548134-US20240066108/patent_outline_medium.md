- show that MPLA is not an effective adjuvant
- investigate combination of irradiated cells and DMXAA
- show that CPMV lacks consistent efficacy with heat-shocked or HOCl-oxidized lysates
- show that CPMV and irradiated cells provide superior survival benefit
- confirm that both antigen and adjuvant are necessary for vaccine efficacy
- show that CPMV provides dependable protection against rechallenge
- establish combination of CPMV and irradiated cells as superior vaccine
- show that vaccine's immunological mechanism requires T cells

### Results

### Discussion

- motivate need for patient-centered immunotherapies
