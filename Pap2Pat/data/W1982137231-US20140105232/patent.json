                        "There exist many devices and techniques in which an optical reference cavity is employed as a frequency reference. One application of particular interest is locking the output frequency of a laser source to an optical resonance frequency of an optical reference cavity 20 (FIG. 1). A variety of schemes have been developed to achieve such locking. Examples include, inter alia, the H\u00e4nsch-Couillaud method and the Pound-Drever-Hall method.",
                        "Any resonant optical cavity exhibits multiple resonance frequencies that are spaced by the cavity's free spectral range, which is in turn determined by the optical pathlength of the reference cavity over an operational frequency range (equivalently, an operational wavelength range). Over typical operational wavelength ranges (e.g., a few tens or hundreds of nanometers at so-called optical frequencies), the multiple resonance frequencies can be regarded as substantially uniformly spaced in frequency. The linewidth of the resonances of the reference cavity in part determine the utility of the cavity as a frequency reference. Narrower resonant linewidth results in improved precision of frequency measurement or control using the optical reference cavity. The linewidth is mainly determined by the so-called Q-factor of the optical reference cavity, which is in turn determined primarily by the total round-trip optical loss of the reference cavity. Reference cavity Q-factors exceeding 108 and approaching 109 have been demonstrated in optical reference cavities comprising a closed-loop dielectric waveguide formed on a substrate chip; some examples are disclosed in one or more of the preceding references. Such large Q-factors can yield, for example as shown in FIG. 2, frequency linewidths of only a few hundred kHz (or even down to several tens of kHz) at optical frequencies on the order of 2\u00d71014 Hz (i.e., wavelengths around 1500 nm).",
                        "Frequency linewidth is not the only determinant of a reference cavity's utility as a frequency reference. Because the optical pathlength of the reference cavity depends on the effective index of the corresponding cavity optical mode and the physical length of the cavity, the multiple resonance frequencies are temperature dependent. Use of an optical reference cavity therefore requires temperature control and stabilization to maintain a sufficiently stable frequency reference. As requirements for the stability of a frequency reference become more and more stringent, however, simple thermal control and stabilization of an optical reference cavity may not be sufficient. Even if the optical reference cavity is maintained at a perfectly invariant bulk temperature, variations or fluctuations in the center frequency of each of the multiple cavity resonances can occur (as in FIG. 3) and can arise from one of several sources. A first source of such fluctuations is the occurrence of localized, transient, statistical fluctuations in the temperature of the reference cavity (i.e., so-called thermorefractive noise). A second source of resonance center frequency fluctuations is the thermal excitation of relatively high frequency (e.g., on the order of 1-100 MHz) vibrational modes of the reference cavity or its supporting structures and coupling of those vibrational modes to the optical modes supported by the reference cavity (i.e., so-called thermomechanical noise). A third source of resonance center frequency fluctuations is the absorption of light circulating in the reference cavity by localized, random defects in the optical material of the reference cavity, which in turn causes localized, intensity dependent heating of the reference cavity (i.e., so-called photothermal noise). These three are major sources of frequency fluctuations in an optical reference cavity realized as a closed-loop dielectric waveguide formed on a substrate chip. Because such on-chip optical reference cavities are desirable for various reasons (e.g., compactness, robustness, manufacturability), it would be desirable to provide on-chip optical reference cavities that exhibit reduced center frequency fluctuations."

The optical reference cavity 20 comprises an optical waveguide 30 that is formed on the waveguide substrate 10 and arranged to form a closed loop greater than or about equal to 1 meter in length. The optical reference cavity 20 exhibits multiple resonance frequencies over an operational wavelength range, and can be characterized over the operational wavelength range by a Q-factor and a RMS resonance frequency fluctuation. In accordance with the present disclosure, the Q-factor of the optical reference cavity is greater than or about equal to 108, and the RMS resonance frequency fluctuation is less than or about equal to 100 Hz.",
                        "In general, any suitable substrate material, waveguide material, or waveguide morphology can be employed provided the performance characteristics recited in the preceding paragraph are met. The center frequency noise is observed to scale inversely with respect to the mode volume of the corresponding resonant optical mode (as in FIG. 4), so lengthening the closed loop optical reference cavity decreases the resonance frequency fluctuations arising from thermorefractive noise, thermomechanical noise, or photothermal noise. A closed loop greater than or about equal to 1 meter in length yields a reduction in center frequency noise that achieves the RMS resonance frequency fluctuation that is less than or about equal to 100 Hz. At that length, an extremely low-loss waveguide typically must be employed to achieve a sufficiently large Q-factor, i.e., greater than or about equal to 108. A waveguide morphology that exhibits optical loss less than or about equal to 0.2 dB/meter for propagation of an optical signal along the optical waveguide can be sufficient to yield a Q-factor of about 108 or more in a resonator cavity that is about 1 meter long.",
                        "If needed or desired, more stringent performance parameters can be employed for the optical reference cavity. In some examples, the closed-loop waveguide can be greater than or about equal to 2 meters in length, greater than or about equal to 10 meters in length, or about equal to some other suitably chosen length (e.g., between about 1 and about 10 m or even longer). In some examples, reduction of center frequency noise by lengthening the optical reference cavity can yield RMS resonance frequency fluctuations less than or about equal to 20 Hz or less than or equal to about 10 Hz. In some examples, the reference cavity Q-factor can exceed about 2\u00d7108 or about 5\u00d7108, or can approach 109, with corresponding narrowing of the resonance frequency linewidth for a given cavity length.",
                        "Any suitably low-loss waveguide morphology can be employed to achieve the desired Q-factor for a given reference cavity length, including, for example, a solid core material surrounded by a solid cladding or encapsulating material, or a solid core material surrounded by a gaseous ambient medium. Typically great care and attention are required to fabricate the optical waveguide to exhibit sufficiently low optical loss, e.g., less than about 0.2 dB/m, less than about 0.1 dB/m, less than about 0.05 dB/m, less than about 0.02 dB/m, or less than about 0.01 dB/m. Some examples of suitable optical waveguide materials or morphologies are disclosed in the preceding references.",
                        "In one specific group of examples (FIG. 5; see U.S. Pub. No. 2012/0321245 incorporated above), a transverse cross section of the optical waveguide 30 comprises a dielectric material supported by a pedestal or pillar 12 of substrate material. A lateral portion 32 of the dielectric material extends transversely beyond the pedestal 12 of the substrate material and an optical mode 99 of the optical reference cavity 20 is guided at least partly by an interface between the dielectric material and an ambient medium 40 at a lateral surface 34 of the extended portion 32 of the dielectric material. In some examples, the lateral surface 34 of the dielectric material forms an acute angle with a bottom surface 36 thereof. In some examples the ambient medium 40 is gaseous and comprises atmospheric or conditioned air (e.g., temperature-controlled or dehumidified), one or more inert gases (e.g., nitrogen or noble gas), or near vacuum (i.e., whatever residual gas composition and pressure remains after the volume containing the reference cavity has been evacuated by a suitably chosen pump). In some other examples the ambient medium can comprise a liquid, gel, or solid dielectric embedding medium, provided there is sufficient index contrast between the optical waveguide 30 and the ambient medium 40 to enable guiding of the optical mode 99 by the interface between the waveguide 30 and the ambient medium 40.",
                        "The substrate 10 commonly comprises one or more semiconductor materials and the dielectric material of waveguide 30 commonly comprises one or more oxide materials. In some examples, the low-index dielectric material comprises silica or doped silica between about 2 \u03bcm and about 10 \u03bcm thick, the substrate material comprises silicon or doped silicon, and the low-index dielectric material extends transversely more than about 70-80 \u03bcm beyond the pedestal of the substrate material. Optical waveguides formed within those parameters have exhibited optical loss less than or about equal to 0.2 dB/m and often much lower (see above) for propagation of the optical mode along the optical waveguide. In many of these examples, the operational wavelength range includes one or more portions of the visible or near infrared optical spectrum; other spectral regions can be employed if needed or desired.",
                        "For forming an on-chip optical reference cavity 20, it is desirable to reduce the area occupied by a cavity of a given length. The \u201carea occupied\u201d is not intended to include only the area of the substrate 10 that is literally covered by the waveguide 30, but is intended to include the entire area of the substrate 10 that is occupied by the reference cavity 20 so that other structures cannot be readily formed on portions of that area. For example, if the optical reference cavity 20 comprises a circular ring resonator, then the area \u201coccupied\u201d by the reference cavity is the entire area of the circle, not just the thin annular area covered by the waveguide 30. In some examples of an optical reference cavity 20, the closed loop path of the optical waveguide 30 (that is at least about 1 meter in length) comprises two or more linked spirals and occupies an area on the waveguide substrate less than or about equal to, e.g., 5 cm2 (or even smaller in some examples). In another example, a reference cavity comprising multiple linked spirals and having a length of about 300 meters can be formed on a substrate area of about 300 cm2. Increasing the density of the spiral waveguide (i.e., reducing the pitch of the spiral) can allow a longer cavity to occupy a given area, or a cavity of a given length to occupy a smaller area. The two linked spirals can be interleaved on the substrate and joined together to form a closed loop; two pairs of such interleaved spirals can be linked together to form a closed loop. In the example of FIG. 6, the two pairs 20a and 20b of interleaved spirals are different sizes, which can allow more efficient use of substrate area. Alternatively, the two pairs of interleaved spirals can be substantially the same size. In other examples, more than two pairs of interleaved spirals can be employed. At least a portion of one or more of the spirals in any of these examples can comprise an Archimedean spiral.",
                        "An optical apparatus according to the present disclosure can further comprise a laser source 50 and a second optical waveguide 52 (FIGS. 1 and 6). The second optical waveguide 52 is arranged so as to couple optically a portion of an optical signal emitted by the laser source 50 to the optical reference cavity 20. A feedback mechanism 54 of any suitable type (see above) produces an error signal based on the interaction between the coupled portion of the optical signal and the optical reference cavity 20. That error signal is used to control one or more operating parameters of the laser source so as to lock an optical frequency of the optical signal to one of the resonance frequencies of the optical reference cavity 20, thereby stabilizing the output optical frequency of the laser source 50. In some examples, the second optical waveguide 52 is formed on the waveguide substrate 10 along with the optical reference cavity 20. Typically such an integrally formed optical waveguide 52 is arranged to convey the optical signal to the optical reference cavity 20 by directional optical coupling of any suitable type (e.g., mode-interference coupling or adiabatic coupling; directional coupling is also sometimes referred to as transverse coupling). Integral formation of the optical reference cavity 20 and the second optical waveguide 52 can enable reproducible levels of optical coupling to be achieved between the optical reference cavity 20 and the second optical waveguide 52. In addition to reducing center frequency fluctuations arising from thermorefractive, thermomechanical, or photothermal noise, increasing the length of the reference cavity 20 (thereby increasing its mode volume) also increases the optical power level at which photothermal noise becomes significant. That in turn allows larger optical signals to be coupled into the reference cavity for improved performance of the feedback mechanism 54 without concomitant increase in photothermal noise.",
                        "It can be further advantageous also to form the laser source 50 on the same substrate 10 with the optical reference cavity 20 and the second optical waveguide 52. Such monolithic formation is particularly facilitated when the substrate 10 is a semiconductor and the laser source 50 is a semiconductor laser source.",
