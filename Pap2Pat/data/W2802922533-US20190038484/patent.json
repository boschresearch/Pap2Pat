    "abstract": "A system and method for improving stability of a wheelchair user includes a wheelchair having sensors measuring motion parameters to sense collisions and sharp turns which may unseat the user. Neuromuscular stimulating electrodes attached to extensor and flexor muscles of the user's trunk and under the command of a controller in communication with the sensors activate the muscles during turns and collisions to counteract the forces induced. A system and method for increasing manual propulsion efficiency includes sensors for sensing motion parameters indicating completion of a manual push of the wheelchair wheels and recovery from the push. Neuromuscular stimulating electrodes attached to extensor and flexor muscles of the user's trunk and under the command of a controller in communication with the sensors activate the muscles at the appropriate time in the cycle of push and recovery.",

                        "For people with spinal cord injuries who have lost the ability to control their trunk muscles, minor disturbances, such as a sharp turn or a collision with a curb, can destabilize the user and cause a loss of erect sitting posture, potentially leading to injurious falls. Falls are in fact the leading cause of injury for wheelchair users, and account for over 66,000 wheelchair related injuries per year. The injuries can be serious and include lacerations, contusions, abrasions, fractures and can result in death. According to at least one survey of people having spinal cord injuries, trunk stability is among the top functions they would like to see restored. There is clearly an opportunity to improve the safety of wheelchair users by increasing trunk stability.",
                        "Loss of control of trunk muscles also reduces the efficiency of manual propulsion of wheelchairs. Wheelchair users with poor trunk control due to paralysis of core thigh, hip and trunk muscles have limited trunk stability and may be unable to fully or safely lean backward and forward, resulting in inefficient pushing of the wheelchair. The inability to efficiently propel the wheelchair can make traversing challenging terrain, such as inclined ramps, difficult and can also lead to shoulder injuries. There is clearly an opportunity to improve the efficiency of wheelchair propulsion by increasing or restoring a degree of trunk control."

                        "FIGS. 1 and 2 show an example embodiment of a wheelchair system 10 according to the invention. System 10 comprises a wheelchair 12. A motion sensor 14 is positioned on the wheelchair 12. Motion sensor 14 measures one or more motion parameters of wheelchair 12 and generates signals indicative of the motion parameters. In an example embodiment the sensor 14 may be an inertial measurement unit (IMU) including accelerometers for measuring motion parameters such as acceleration of the wheelchair 12 in three mutually perpendicular axes (X, Y and Z as defined in FIG. 1) as well as one or more gyroscopes for measuring motion parameters such as angular velocity and angular acceleration of the wheelchair about the axes X, Y and Z. The sensor 14 also includes a radio frequency transmitter 16 used to transmit the signals wirelessly. A controller 18 is also part of system 10. In this example the controller 18 is also mounted on the wheelchair 12 but in another embodiment may be worn by (mounted on) the user 20. In the example embodiment shown controller 18 comprises a radio frequency receiver 22 for receiving signals from the sensor 14, and a microprocessor 24 in communication with receiver 22. The microprocessor may be, for example, a programmable logic controller. Software resident in the microprocessor 24 evaluates the signals from the sensor 14 and directs the microprocessor to issue commands to one or more of a plurality of neural stimulating electrodes 26, also part of system 10. Communication between controller 18 and electrodes 26 may be via wires or wirelessly.",

Electrodes 26 can be mounted on the surface skin of the user 20 using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation equipment (TENS) or implanted beneath the skin, using intramuscular implants or nerve cuff electrodes. In an experimental setting, an example system 10 used 8, 12 or 16 channel IPGs to deliver asymmetrical charged-balanced current controlled stimulus waveforms with pulse amplitudes (0-20 mA) selectable for each channel and variable pulse durations (0-250 \u03bcsec) and frequencies (0-20 Hz) set on a pulse by pulse basis.",

This goal is accomplished by using the controller 18 to stimulate and thereby activate selected muscles and muscle groups (over which user 20 has lost control due to a spinal cord injury) in response to the motion parameters measured by sensor 14 and evaluated by algorithms in the software of the controller 18. When activated, the selected muscles restore trunk stability appropriately in response to the particular destabilizing event.",
                        "For collisions, such as when the wheelchair 12 encounters a curb, a linear motion parameter in the direction of wheelchair motion is used to determine muscle activation. Example linear motion parameters used by the controller 18 and measured by sensor 14 may be linear velocity, linear acceleration, or a combination of the two. The selected muscles to be activated by electrodes 26 in response to a collision are selected from knee, hip and trunk extensor muscles and include the erector spinae, the quadratus lumborum, the gluteus maximus, the posterior adductor and combinations thereof.",
                        "For sharp turns, an angular motion parameter oriented about a turning axis (axis Z in FIG. 1) of wheelchair 12 is used to determine muscle activation. Example angular motion parameters used by the controller and measured by sensor 14 include angular acceleration, angular velocity, and combinations of the two. The selected muscles to be activated by electrodes 26 in response to a sharp turn are again selected from knee, hip and trunk extensor muscles, but are separated laterally, with the right erector spinae, right quadratus lumborum, right gluteus maximus, and right posterior adductor muscles being selected when the motion parameter is an angular acceleration or an angular velocity in a counterclockwise direction about the Z axis, and the left erector spinae, left quadratus lumborum, left gluteus maximus, and left posterior adductor muscles being selected when the motion parameter is an angular acceleration or an angular velocity in a clockwise direction about the Z axis.",

FIG. 3 shows a flowchart illustrating an example method, which comprises:\n\n\n- - measuring a motion parameter of the wheelchair (**28**);\n  - generating a signal indicative of the motion parameter (**30**);\n  - evaluating the signal (**32**); and\n  - activating at least one muscle of the user in response to the signal\n    (**34**).",
                        "As noted above, measuring the motion parameter of the wheelchair 12 includes measuring a linear acceleration and/or linear velocity (for a collision for example) and measuring the angular velocity and/or angular acceleration of the wheelchair about a turning axis (for sharp turns for example). Generating a signal includes generating a signal, for example, a voltage signal, indicative of any of the motion parameters including a linear velocity, a linear acceleration, an angular velocity, an angular acceleration, and combinations thereof.",
                        "Evaluating the signal for a collision event comprises converting the signal to a value indicative of the magnitude of the motion parameter and then comparing that magnitude to a known threshold value at which muscle stimulus should be applied. Effective threshold values are known from experiment to vary with each wheelchair user, and in experimental applications of the method, collision acceleration thresholds ranging from 3.05 g to about 3.76 g were identified for determining when muscle stimulus should be applied to the extensor muscles to resist forward flexion to stabilize the user and assist return to upright sitting during the collision.",
                        "For a turning event, evaluating the signal required determining the direction of the turn as well as its magnitude. Determining the turn direction comprises comparing the measured direction to a reference direction to determine whether to activate the left or right muscle groups. Experimental angular motion parameter magnitude thresholds for determining when to apply the muscle stimulus ranged from about 97 degrees/sec to about 100 degrees/sec for applying muscle stimulation during turns.",
                        "The step of activating at least one muscle, the muscle or muscle group is selected based upon the measured motion parameters and the neural stimulus is applied to the selected muscles appropriate for the event (collision or turn). As noted above for an example embodiment, the erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, and posterior adductor muscles are selected when the measured motion parameter is a linear acceleration (indicating a collision) which exceeds a threshold value. For a measured angular motion parameter indicating a left turn and which exceeds a threshold value, one or more muscles comprises the right erector spinae, the right quadratus lumborum, the right gluteus maximus, and the right posterior adductor muscles are selected. For a measured angular motion parameter indicating a right turn and which exceeds a threshold value, one or more muscles comprising the left erector spinae, the left quadratus lumborum, the left gluteus maximus, and the left posterior adductor muscles are selected.",
                        "FIG. 4 illustrates a detailed example method according to the invention used during a collision. In this example, the linear acceleration in the direction of motion of the wheelchair (axis X, anterior/posterior acceleration) is monitored (36) using the sensor 14 and controller 18. Once motion is detected, algorithms 38, 40 and 42 within the controller 18 begin monitoring the signals from the sensor 14 to detect a collision. Algorithm 38 calculates the moving root mean square of the anterior/posterior acceleration continually and compares it against a threshold. Algorithm 40 compares the derivative of the RMS anterior/posterior acceleration against a threshold. Algorithm 42 calculates the change in velocity (integral of acceleration) and compares that to a threshold. If the thresholds are exceeded within a predetermined time period, T1, then a crash has occurred and the appropriate neuromuscular stimulation is applied by the controller 18 via electrodes 26.",
                        "FIG. 5 illustrates another example embodiment of the method according to the invention which comprises the steps of:\n\n\n- - measuring a motion parameter of the wheelchair (**44**);\n  - generating a signal indicative of the motion parameter (**46**);\n  - evaluating the signal (**48**); and\n  - activating at least one user restraint in response to the signal\n    (**50**).",
                        "The method steps are similar to those for applying neuromuscular stimulation as described above, the difference being that a mechanical restraint is applied instead of muscular stimulation. As shown in FIG. 6 the restraints may include applying a brake 52, tightening a seat belt 54 to restrain user 20, and/or broadcasting a distress signal from a speaker 56 or over a radio frequency transmitter 58. Activation of the various restraints is effected by the controller 18 via appropriate interfaces, such as a servomotor 60 to tighten the seat belt, or an actuator 62, such as a solenoid, to apply the brake. The various mechanical devices used with the system 10 are advantageously electrical, to permit the system to be operated by a battery 64.",
                        "FIG. 7 shows another system 66 which improves the efficiency of manually propelled wheelchairs 68. System 66 is advantageous for users 70 with poor trunk control due to paralysis of core, thigh, hip and trunk muscles. Such users have limited trunk stability and are either unable to fully lean backward and forward when pushing the wheels 72 or are unsafe when doing so. This condition leads to inefficient pushing and thus difficulty in traversing challenging terrain such as inclined ramps.",
                        "System 66 comprises at least one sensor 74 positioned on user 70 for measuring a motion parameter of the user while the user is propelling the wheelchair 68. Motion parameters which are useful in system 66 include a position of a part of the user, an acceleration of a part of the user, a rate of change of acceleration of a part of the user as well as an electrical potential of a muscle of the user. One or more sensors 74 may be advantageously positioned on the user's upper trunk 76, shoulder 78, arm 80, in particular wrist 82, and head 84 for measuring the motion parameters of one or more of these parts of user 70. When it is desired to use electrical potential of a muscle as a motion parameter it is advantageous to use an electromyographic sensor mounted on the shoulder 78. Sensor 74 generates one or more signals indicative of the motion parameter while the user is propelling wheelchair 68.",
                        "In this example embodiment, one motion sensor 74 is used. Sensor 74 comprises a tri-axial accelerometer, such as a commercially available activity tracker, and is worn on the wrist 82. The wrist accelerometer 74 has a radiofrequency transmitter which transmit the signals indicative of the selected motion parameters wirelessly to a controller 86. Controller 86 may be worn by (mounted on) the user 70 or mounted on the wheelchair 68 (shown). In the example embodiment shown, controller 86 comprises a radiofrequency receiver 88 for receiving signals from the sensors 74, and a microprocessor 90 in communication with receiver 88. The microprocessor may be, for example, a programmable logic controller. Software resident in the microprocessor 90 evaluates the signals from the sensors 74 and directs the microprocessor to issue commands to one or more of a plurality of neural stimulating electrodes 92, also part of system 66.",
                        "Electrodes 92 are attached to respective muscles (detailed below) of the user 70 and selected ones are activated in response to the signals according to algorithms encoded in the software in the microprocessor 90. Electrodes 92 can be mounted on the surface skin of the user 70 using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation equipment (TENS) or implanted beneath the skin, using intramuscular implants or nerve cuff electrodes. Selected muscles on which electrodes 92 are to be attached for neuromuscular stimulation to improve propulsion efficiency include hip flexor muscles, hip extensor muscles, trunk flexor muscles, trunk extensor muscles, abdominal muscles and combinations thereof.",
                        "The invention further encompasses a method of providing assistance to user 70 for manually propelling wheelchair 68. An example method is illustrated in FIGS. 8-14, and comprises:\n\n\n- - detecting when user **70** has recovered from a previous push of the\n    wheels **72** of the wheelchair **68** (FIG. 8);\n  - user **70** executing a next push of the wheels **72** (FIGS. 9-11);\n  - applying neural stimulation to trunk and hip flexor muscles of user\n    **70** while the user executes the next push of the wheels;\n  - detecting when the user has completed the next push of the wheels\n    (FIG. 11);\n  - removing neural stimulation to the trunk and hip flexor muscles of\n    user **70** when the user has completed the next push of said wheels\n    (FIG. 11);\n  - the user **70** recovering from the next push of said wheels (FIGS.\n    12-14);\n  - applying neural stimulation to trunk and hip extensor muscles of the\n    user **70** while the user is recovering from the next push of the\n    wheels (FIGS. 12-14);\n  - detecting when the user **70** has recovered from the next push of\n    the wheels (FIG. 8);\n  - removing neural stimulation from the trunk and the hip extensor\n    muscles of the user **70** when the user has recovered from the next\n    push of the wheels (FIG. 8).",
                        "As illustrated in FIGS. 8-14, it is advantageous to apply neuromuscular stimulation to the trunk and hip flexor muscles while user 70 executes a push of wheels 72 because the pushing effort of the arms 80 is augmented by the force and weight of the trunk 76 as it bends forward in flexion (FIGS. 9-11) in response to the stimulation. Similarly, it is advantageous to remove the stimulation to the trunk and hip flexor muscles and apply stimulation to the trunk and hip extension muscles to cause extension of the trunk 76 (FIGS. 12-14) so that the user 70 may recover in preparation for the next push (FIG. 8). The timing of the application and removal of the neuromuscular stimulation depends upon detecting when user 70 has recovered and when the user has completed a push.",
                        "Detecting when user 70 has recovered from a push is effected by measuring a motion parameter of a part of the user while recovering. Practical motion parameters include a position of a part of the user, an acceleration of a part of the user, a rate of change of acceleration of a part of the user and an electrical potential of a muscle of the user, as well as combinations of these motion parameters. The parts of the user for which these motion parameters may be measured include the upper trunk 76, the shoulder 78, the arm 80, the wrist 82, the head 84 and combinations of these parts.",

FIGS. 15 and 16 illustrate an example embodiment of an algorithm using these wrist motion parameters.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 15, detecting when user 70 has completed a push of wheels 72 is effected by:\n\n\n- - detecting an acceleration signal indicative of anterior-posterior\n    acceleration of a part of the user (wrist **82**) greater than a\n    predetermined threshold value (**94**);\n  - detecting an increasing rate of change of the acceleration signal\n    (**96**);\n  - detecting a medial-lateral acceleration of the part of the user\n    (wrist **82**) within a predetermined range of values (**98**).",
