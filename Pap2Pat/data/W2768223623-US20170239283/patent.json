                        "Benign neoplasia: Tissue (such as a mass or growth) that does not invade surrounding tissue or metastasize, but in contrast to pre-malignant tissue, has limited potential for growth, and includes well-differentiated cells (e.g., cells with strong resemblance to normal cells in the tissue of origin).",
                        "Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN): CDNs are cyclic compounds including two nucleotides. Some CDNs are produced by bacteria and are signaling molecules involved in regulation of bacterial biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. They bind to STING protein and in some examples activate the interferon pathway. Exemplary CDNs include cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (CDA), cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (CDG), cyclic di-inosine monophosphate (CDI), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (CGAMP). CDNs also include modified CDNs or derivatives of CDNs, such as CDNs that are less susceptible to phosphodiesterase degradation and/or having increased activity compared to naturally occurring STING ligands.

                        "Papilloma: A neoplasm of epithelial origin having a morphology with a finger-like or cauliflower-like appearance. Papillomas are typically benign, but are pre-malignant in some cases. They are usually caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and commonly occur in the skin, genitals, mouth, eyes, and throat. Other types of papilloma, such as intraductal papilloma and choroid plexus papilloma are unknown cause.",
                        "Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (vehicles) useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, The University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Editor, Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa., 21st Edition (2005), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic compositions, such as one or more STING agonists, and/or additional pharmaceutical agents.",
                        "In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of one or more non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, pH buffering agents, and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.",

Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases while formed by acid partners that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, for example, inorganic acids (such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid) or organic acids (such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or salicylic acid). Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, or aluminum salts. Exemplary salts are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethypiperidine, polyamine resins, and the like. Exemplary organic bases are isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, choline, and caffeine. See, e.g., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection and Use, Wiley VCH (2002); Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19, 1977.",
                        "Pre-malignant: A condition of being potentially, but not yet, malignant. Pre-malignant tissue (such as a mass or growth) typically exhibits hyperplasia and/or dysplasia, for example, an increase or expansion of immature cells relative to normal tissue. Dysplasia frequently includes microscopic changes in tissue, such as anisocytosis (cells of unequal sizes), poikilocytosis (abnormally shaped cells), hyperchromatism, and/or an increase in cell division (for example, as identified by presence of mitotic figures). Pre-malignant growths do not have the ability to invade neighboring tissue or metastasize.",
                        "Prodrug: A compound that is transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound, for example by hydrolysis in the gut or enzymatic conversion in blood. Common examples include, but are not limited to ester and amide forms of a compound having an active form bearing a carboxylic acid moiety. See, e.g., Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Eds., Higuchi and Stella, ACS Symposium Series, Vol. 14, 1975; Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Roche, Pergamon Press, 1987.",

                        "Treating or inhibiting: \u201cTreating\u201d a condition refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition, for example, a pre-malignant or virally-induced growth, after it has begun to develop. As used herein, the term \u201cameliorating,\u201d refers to any observable beneficial effect of the treatment. The beneficial effect can be evidenced, for example, by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms of the disease in a susceptible subject, a reduction in severity of some or all clinical symptoms of the disease, a slower progression of the disease, a reduction in the number of relapses of the disease, an improvement in the overall health or well-being of the subject, or by other parameters well known in the art that are specific to the particular disease. \u201cInhibiting\u201d refers to inhibiting the full development of the disease or condition. Inhibition of a condition can span the spectrum from partial inhibition to substantially complete inhibition (e.g., including, but not limited to prevention) of the condition. In some examples, the term \u201cinhibiting\u201d refers to reducing or delaying the onset or progression of a disease. A subject to be administered a therapeutically effective amount of the disclosed compositions can be identified by standard diagnosing techniques for such a disorder, for example, based on signs and symptoms, family history, or risk factor to develop the disease or disorder.",

                                "The methods disclosed herein utilize STING agonists. STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) is a cytosolic sensor of microbial infection. In particular, STING is an innate immune sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, which are believed to be produced only by bacteria and archaea (Burdette et al., Nature 478:515-518, 2011). Binding of CDNs to STING induces interferon (IFN) expression and inflammatory responses.",
                                "In some examples, STING agonists include compounds that bind to STING and increase expression and/or secretion of interferon (such as IFN-\u03b2), for example in macrophage cells. In other examples, STING agonists include compounds that bind to STING and activate the TBK1-IRF3 pathway, for example increasing TBK1 and/or IRF3 phosphorylation or activity. In each case, an increase in expression, secretion, or phosphorylation can be determined by comparison to a control, such as an unstimulated cell, or a cell contacted with a known STING agonist or a compound known not to bind to or activate STING. Binding of compounds to STING can be detected by determining binding of a radiolabeled compound to STING, for example utilizing UV crosslinking or competitive binding assays. Methods of detecting expression or secretion of IFN include reporter gene assays, RT-PCR assays, and antibody-based assays (such as ELISA). Protein phosphorylation assays, for example, using Western blot-based assays can be used to detect TBK1 or IRF3 phosphorylation.",

In some examples, the disclosed CDNs are substantially pure stereoisomers (e.g., Rp,Rp or Rp,Sp stereoisomers of a CDN). Stereoisomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms and which differ only in the three-dimensional orientation of the atoms in space.",

The modified or derivative CDNs retain at least one activity of CDN STING agonists, such as binding to STING and increasing expression and/or secretion of interferon (such as IFN-\u03b2) and/or activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. In some examples, modified CDN or CDN derivative STING agonists include CDN thiophosphate compounds. One exemplary CDN thiophosphate compound is dithio-CDG (RR or RS stereoisomers). In another example, a modified STING agonist includes fluorinated CDNs, such as CDNs with a fluorine atom at the 2\u2032 position of the nucleoside (e.g., c-di[2\u2032FdGMP]). Additional exemplary modified CDNs or CDN derivatives that are STING agonists include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. App. Publ. No. 2014/0205653, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",

In general, an effective amount of a STING agonist administered to a subject will vary depending upon a number of factors associated with that subject, for example the overall health of the subject, the condition to be treated, or the severity of the condition. An effective amount of a STING agonist can be determined by varying the dosage of the compound and measuring the resulting therapeutic response, such as a decrease in the size, volume, or number of pre-malignant, benign, or virally-induced growth(s). Alternatively, response can be assessed by measuring cytokine or other markers of inflammation released locally, or measured systemically in the blood. In other examples, response is assessed by visual inspection of the growth, for example, changes in swelling, redness, temperature changes, and/or blackening of all or portions of the growth.",

These doses may administered through distributed injections, where the lesion may be subdivided into zones for multiple injections, for example each 5 mm2 zone may receive a single injection so that a 25 mm2 lesion may receive 5 separate injections.

However, the effective amount can be dependent on the specific STING agonist(s), the subject being treated, the severity and type of the condition being treated, and the manner of administration. In some examples, a dose of a STING agonist is administered daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, once or more (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more doses). In some examples, the effectiveness of the one or more STING agonists is monitored by observing the pre-malignant or virally-induced growth over time (for example, size, volume, and/or number of growths). Subjects who are found to have been poorly or partially responsive to the initial administration are given one or more additional doses of the one or more STING agonists. Thus, in some examples, weekly cycles of administration may result in loss of disease and will reveal regions of disease that did not initially respond or did not receive injection (e.g., in the case of bulky disease). In this case repeated cycles of treatment may be applied until all disease is lost or until residual material can suitably be removed through techniques such as surgical resection or loop excision.",

A clinician of ordinary skill in the art can identify appropriate additional treatments for a subject based on the type of condition being treated. In non-limiting examples, a subject with DCIS may also be treated with surgical excision, endocrine therapy, and/or radiation therapy, while a subject with plantar warts may also be treated with liquid nitrogen with skin shaving.",

At variable penetrance, mice develop papilloma of the face and anogenital region (Hingorani et al., Cancer Cell 7:469-483, 2005; Gades et al., Comp. Med. 58:271-275, 2008). Mice bearing papilloma with no evidence of pancreatic tumors and less than 90 days of age were accrued to this study. Masses were treated by injection of 25 \u03bcg of c-di-CDG (Invivogen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog No. tlrl-naldg), Imiquimod (Invivogen) or PBS vehicle.",

This results in progressive carcinogenesis through pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Hingorani et al., Cancer Cell 7:469-483, 2005). In addition, these mice spontaneously develop papilloma of the face and vulva, as shown in FIG. 1, where in places the normal skin undergoes epidermal thickening that closely resembles HPV-associated papilloma in humans.",
                                "The Pdx-Cre+/\u2212 Kras(G12D)+/\u2212 Trp53 (R172H)+/\u2212 mice were observed to develop papilloma at variable penetrance, as has been previously reported in the literature (Hingorani et al., Cancer Cell 7:469-483, 2005; Gades et al., Comp. Med. 58:271-275, 2008). We found no association between papilloma formation and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the mice, and generally the papilloma was present before progression to invasive carcinoma in the pancreas. Some mice developed more than one papilloma, with the location restricted to the periauricular and anogenital regions. As previously reported, papilloma formation required both PDX-Cre and Kras(G12D) genotypes, suggesting a genetic origin (Gades et al., Comp. Med. 58:271-275, 2008). Prior studies failed to find an infectious origin for these papilloma (Gades et al., Comp. Med. 58:271-275, 2008), and in our colony papilloma were never found in PDX-Cre\u2212 animals nor PDX-Cre+ Trp53(R172H)+/\u2212 mice that lacked Kras(G12D), despite co-housing. Mice were unperturbed by the papilloma, and though individual papilloma could be large, we found no evidence of progression to invasive carcinoma at the site. However, progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in these mice precluded long-term follow up of the papilloma. Histological analysis of the papilloma demonstrated significant thickening of the skin with formation of classical keratinized papilloma as reported (Gades et al., Comp. Med. 58:271-275, 2008).",
                                "STING ligands were administered into the papilloma by direct injection with a total dose of 25 \u03bcg administered in a 25 \u03bcl injection volume. In the control case, 25 \u03bcg of Imiquimod was administered using the same technique. For larger papillomas, the injection was split between different sites within the same growth. The total dose to the growth remained 25 \u03bcg in each case. The animals were retreated on day 7 with a second cycle of injections.",
                                "Rapid alterations in small papilloma to resemble normal skin were observed within 18 hours of treatment (FIGS. 2A and B). In pilot studies, mice bearing papilloma were randomly assigned to treatment with the STING ligand c-di-GMP (CDG) or PBS vehicle control. In an example of a mouse with two small papilloma on the face, one was treated by direct injection of CDG, and the other given vehicle control (FIG. 2A, left). The CDG-injected papilloma rapidly reverted to normal skin within 18 hours (FIG. 2A, right). The site exhibited slight reddening, and histological analysis demonstrated an inflammatory infiltrate in the subcutaneous space (FIG. 2B). Injection of STING ligand into histologically normal skin at distant sites or in normal mice had no observable effect (not shown). Thus, CDG was non-toxic at these doses and caused rapid, site-specific regression of experimental papilloma.",

Importantly, this effect was dramatically more effective than the existing Imiquimod treatment (FIG. 3A). We tested treatment of larger, 3-15 mm papilloma with STING ligands. A single injection of CDG resulted in rapid loss of papilloma around the injection site, but these did not fully regress. Therefore, we developed a treatment course consisting of injections on d0 and d1, and again on d7 and d8 as the papilloma decreased in size (FIG. 3B). Mice were randomized to receive CDG, to conventional treatment with the TLR7 ligand imiquimod, or PBS vehicle. While imiquimod did not significantly affect the size of the papilloma, CDG treatment resulted in significantly decreased papilloma size (FIGS. 3B and C). The CDG-treated papilloma showed evidence of blackening (FIG. 3A), which was suggestive of the hemorrhagic necrosis previously observed in STING ligand treatment of advanced cancers (Baird et al., Cancer Res. 76:50-61, 2016). Treatment resulted in complete regression of some papilloma, with skin returning to normal appearance without skin breaks and with the return of hair.",
                                "Histological examination of CDG-treated papilloma demonstrated regions of inflammatory infiltrate, but no major areas of necrosis (not shown). To investigate the effect of treatment on T cell infiltration, which we and others have shown play a role in clearance of advanced cancers following administration of STING ligands (Baird et al., Cancer Res. 76:50-61, 2016; Corrales et al., Cell Rep. 11:1018-1030, 2015), papilloma were stained for infiltrating CD3+ T cells. Few to no T cells were detected in PBS or imiquimod-treated papilloma (FIG. 4A, i-ii), but 24 hours following CDG treatment CD3+ T cells were found associated with the normalized skin epithelium (FIG. 4A, iii). In examples where mice exhibited more than one papilloma, CDG treatment of one papilloma resulted in T cell infiltration and control only in the treated papilloma (FIG. 4B). T cells remained associated with papilloma for extended periods, and were enriched in the normalized skin 14 days following treatment (FIG. 4C)."

STING was also expressed in all HPV-associated dysplasia, with a trend towards increased expression of STING in CIN3 (FIG. 7F). In addition, in all cases, STING was expressed in endothelial structures and immune cells underlying the squamous tissue.

However, HPV+ HNSCC exhibited high levels of STING expression in the cancer cells (FIG. 8A), while HPV\u2212 HNSCC exhibited low or absent STING expression (FIG. 8B). These samples were assigned an expression score according to the proportion of cancer cells with high STING staining in the cytoplasm, using Definiens image analysis software (Definiens, Cambridge, Mass.). These data show that HPV+ HNSCC exhibited significantly higher STING expression in cancer cells than HPV\u2212 HNSCC (FIG. 8C). In view of the basal origin of HPV+ cancer cells, these data suggest that HPV+ cancer cells preserve their STING expression through malignant progression from their basal cell origin. This contrasts to the non-basaloid squamous HPV\u2212 HNSCC that poorly express STING, consistent with the loss of STING expression in the more differentiated cells of the normal squamous epithelium.
