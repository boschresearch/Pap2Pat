                        "Swine dysentery is a significant endemic disease of pigs in Australia and worldwide. Swine dysentery is a contagious mucohaemorrhagic diarrhoeal disease, characterised by extensive inflammation and necrosis of the epithelial surface of the large intestine. Economic losses due to swine dysentery result mainly from growth retardation, costs of medication and mortality. The causative agent of swine dysentery was first identified as an anaerobic spirochaete (Treponema hyodysenteriae) in 1971, and was recently reassigned to the genus Brachyspira as B. hyodysenteriae. Where swine dysentery is established in a piggery, the disease spectrum can vary from being mild, transient or unapparent, to being severe and even fatal. Medication strategies on individual piggeries may mask clinical signs and on some piggeries the disease may go unnoticed, or may only be suspected. Whether or not obvious disease occurs, B. hyodysenteriae may persist in infected pigs, or in other reservoir hosts such as rodents, or in the environment. All these sources pose potential for transmission of the disease to uninfected herds. Commercial poultry may also be colonized by B. hyodysenteriae, although it is not clear how commonly this occurs under field conditions.",
                        "Colonization by B. hyodysenteriae elicits a strong immunological response against the spirochaete, hence indirect evidence of exposure to the spirochaete can be obtained by measuring circulating antibody titres in the blood of infected animals. These antibody titres have been reported to be maintained at low levels, even in animals that have recovered from swine dysentery. Serological tests for detection of antibodies therefore have considerable potential for detecting subclinical infections and recovered carrier pigs that have undetectable numbers of spirochaetes in their large intestines. These tests would be particularly valuable in an easy to use kit form, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A variety of techniques have been developed to demonstrate the presence of circulating antibodies against B. hyodysenteriae, including indirect fluorescent antibody tests, hemagglutination tests, microtitration agglutination tests, complement fixation tests, and ELISA using either lipopolysaccharide or whole sonicated spirochaetes as antigen. All these tests have suffered from problems of specificity, as related non-pathogenic intestinal spirochaetes can induce cross-reactive antibodies. These tests are useful for detecting herds where there is obvious disease and high circulating antibody titres, but they are problematic for identifying sub-clinically infected herds and individual infected pigs. Consequently, to date, no completely sensitive and specific assays are available for the detection of antibodies against B. hyodysenteriae. The lack of suitable diagnostic tests has hampered control of swine dysentery.",
                        "A number of methods are employed to control swine dysentery, varying from the prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents, to complete destocking of infected herds and prevention of re-entry of infected carrier pigs. All these options are expensive and, if they are to be fully effective, they require the use of sophisticated diagnostic tests to monitor progress. Currently, detection of swine dysentery in herds with sub-clinical infections, and individual healthy carrier animals, remains a major problem and is hampering implementation of effective control measures. A definitive diagnosis of swine dysentery traditionally has required the isolation and identification of B. hyodysenteriae from the faeces or mucosa of diseased pigs. Major problems involved include the slow growth and fastidious nutritional requirements of these anaerobic bacteria and confusion due to the presence of morphologically similar spirochaetes in the normal flora of the pig intestine. A significant improvement in the diagnosis of individual affected pigs was achieved with the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of spirochaetes from faeces. Unfortunately in practical applications the limit of detection of PCRs rendered it unable to detect carrier animals with subclinical infections. As a consequence of these diagnostic problems, there is a clear need to develop a simple and effective diagnostic tool capable of detecting B. hyodysenteriae infection at the herd and individual pig level.",
                        "A strong immunological response is induced against the spirochaete following colonization with B. hyodysenteriae, and pigs recovered from swine dysentery are protected from re-infection. Despite this, attempts to develop vaccines to control swine dysentery have met with very limited success, either because they have provided inadequate protection on a herd basis, or they have been too costly and difficult to produce to make them commercially viable. Bacterin vaccines provide some level of protection, but they tend to be lipopolysaccharide serogroup-specific, which then requires the use of multivalent bacterins. Furthermore they are difficult and costly to produce on a large scale because of the fastidious anaerobic growth requirements of the spirochaete.",
                        "Several attempts have been made to develop attenuated live vaccines for swine dysentery. This approach has the disadvantage that attenuated strains show reduced colonization, and hence cause reduced immune stimulation. There also is reluctance on the part of producers and veterinarians to use live vaccines for swine dysentery because of the possibility of reversion to virulence, especially as very little is known about genetic regulation and organization in B. hyodysenteriae.",
                        "The use of recombinant subunit vaccines is an attractive alternative, since the products would be well-defined (essential for registration purposes), and relatively easy to produce on a large scale. To date the first reported use of a recombinant protein from B. hyodysenteriae as a vaccine candidate (a 38-kilodalton flagellar protein) failed to prevent colonization in pigs. This failure is likely to relate specifically to the particular recombinant protein used, as well as to other more down-stream issues of delivery systems and routes, dose rates, choice of adjuvants etc. (Gabe, J. D., Chang, R. J., Slomiany, R., Andrews, W. H. and McCaman, M. T., (1995) \u201cIsolation of Extracytoplasmic Proteins From Serpulina hyodysenteriae B204 and Molecular Cloning of the flaB1 Gene Encoding A 38-Kilodalton Flagellar Protein,\u201d Infection and Immunity 63:142-148). The first reported partially protective recombinant B. hyodysenteriae protein used for vaccination was a 29.7 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein (Bhlp29.7, also referred to as BmpB and BlpA) which had homology with the methionine-binding lipoproteins of various pathogenic bacteria. The use of the his-tagged recombinant Bhlp29.7 protein for vaccination of pigs, followed by experimental challenge with B. hyodysenteriae, resulted in 17-40% of vaccinated pigs developing disease compared to 50-70% of the unvaccinated control pigs developing disease. Since the incidence of disease for the Bhlp29.7 vaccinated pigs was significantly (P=0.047) less than for the control pigs, Bhlp29.7 appeared to have potential as a swine dysentery vaccine component (La, T., Phillips, N.D., Reichel, M. P. and Hampson, D. J. (2004), \u201cProtection of Pigs From Swine Dysentery by Vaccination With Recombinant BmpB, A 29.7 kDa Outer-Membrane Lipoprotein of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae,\u201d Veterinary Microbiology 102:97-109). A number of other attempts have been made to identify outer envelope proteins from B. hyodysenteriae that could be used as recombinant vaccine components, but again no successful vaccine has yet been made. A much more global approach to the identification of potentially useful immunogenic recombinant proteins from B. hyodysenteriae is needed.",
                        "To date, only one study using DNA for vaccination has been reported. In this study, the B. hyodysenteriae finA gene, encoding a putative ferritin, was cloned into an E. coli plasmid and the plasmid DNA used to coat gold beads for ballistic vaccination. A murine model for swine dysentery was used to determine the protective nature of vaccination with DNA and/or recombinant protein. Vaccination with recombinant protein induced a good systemic response against ferritin. However, vaccination with DNA induced only a detectable systemic response. Vaccination with DNA followed a boost with recombinant protein induced a systemic immune response to ferritin only after boosting with protein. However, none of the vaccination regimes tested was able to provide the mice with protection against B. hyodysenteriae colonization and the associated lesions. Interestingly, vaccination of the mice with DNA alone resulted in significant exacerbation of disease (Davis, A. J., Smith, S. C., and Moore, R. J. (2005), \u201cThe Brachyspira hyodysenteriae ftnA Gene: DNA Vaccination and Real-Time PCR Quantification of Bacteria in a Mouse Model of Disease,\u201d Current Microbiology 50:285-291)."

                        "The term \u201camino acid\u201d is intended to embrace all molecules, whether natural or synthetic, which include both an amino functionality and an acid functionality and are capable of being included in a polymer of naturally-occurring amino acids. Exemplary amino acids include naturally-occurring amino acids; analogs, derivatives and congeners thereof; amino acid analogs having variant side chains; and all stereoisomers of any of the foregoing.",
                        "An animal can be any mammal or bird. Examples of mammals include dog, cat, hamster, gerbil, rabbit, ferret, horse, cow, sheep, pig, monkey, and human. Examples of birds include chicken, goose, duck, turkey, and parakeet.",
                        "The term \u201cconserved residue\u201d refers to an amino acid that is a member of a group of amino acids having certain common properties. The term \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d refers to the substitution (conceptually or otherwise) of an amino acid from one such group with a different amino acid from the same group. A functional way to define common properties between individual amino acids is to analyze the normalized frequencies of amino acid changes between corresponding proteins of homologous organisms (Schulz, G. E. and R. H. Schinner., \u201cPrinciples of Protein Structure,\u201d Springer-Verlag). According to such analyzes, groups of amino acids may be defined where amino acids within a group exchange preferentially with each other, and therefore resemble each other most in their impact on the overall protein structure (Schulz, G. E. and R. H. Schirmer, \u201cPrinciples of Protein Structure,\u201d Springer-Verlag). Examples of amino acid groups defined in this manner include: (i) a positively-charged group containing Lys, Arg and His, (ii) a negatively-charged group containing Glu and Asp, (iii) an aromatic group containing Phe, Tyr and Trp, (iv) a nitrogen ring group containing His and Trp, (v) a large aliphatic nonpolar group containing Val, Leu and De, (vi) a slightly polar group containing Met and Cys, (vii) a small-residue group containing Ser, Thr, Asp, Asn, Gly, Ala, Glu, Gln and Pro, (viii) an aliphatic group containing Val, Leu, De, Met and Cys, and (ix) a small, hydroxyl group containing Ser and Thr.",

In many examples of fusion proteins, there are two different polypeptide sequences, and in certain cases, there may be more. The polynucleotide sequences encoding the fusion protein may be operably linked in frame so that the fusion protein may be translated correctly. A fusion protein may include polypeptide sequences from the same species or from different species. In various embodiments, the fusion polypeptide may contain one or more amino acid sequences linked to a first polypeptide. In the case where more than one amino acid sequence is fused to a first polypeptide, the fusion sequences may be multiple copies of the same sequence, or alternatively, may be different amino acid sequences. The fusion polypeptides may be fused to the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or the N- and C-terminus of the first polypeptide. Exemplary fusion proteins include polypeptides containing a glutathione S-transferase tag (GST-tag), histidine tag (His-tag), an immunoglobulin domain or an immunoglobulin binding domain.",

For example, a control sequence \u201coperably linked\u201d to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences, such as when the appropriate molecules (e.g., inducers and polymerases) are bound to the control or regulatory sequence(s).",

Exemplary polypeptides include gene products, naturally-occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments, and other equivalents, variants and analogs of the foregoing.",
                        "The terms \u201cpolypeptide fragment\u201d or \u201cfragment,\u201d when used in reference to a reference polypeptide, refer to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are deleted as compared to the reference polypeptide itself, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical to the corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions may occur at the amino-terminus or carboxy-terminus of the reference polypeptide, or alternatively both. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8, or 10 amino acids long, at least 14 amino acids long, at least 20, 30, 40, or 50 amino acids long, at least 75 amino acids long, or at least 100, 150, 200, 300, 500 or more amino acids long.",

Further, fragments can include a sub-fragment of a specific region, which sub-fragment retains a function of the region from which it is derived. In another embodiment, a fragment may have immunogenic properties.",

Such modified polypeptides, when designed to retain at least one activity of the naturally-occurring form of the protein, are considered \u201cfunctional equivalents\u201d of the polypeptides described in more detail herein. Such modified polypeptides may be produced, for instance, by amino acid substitution, deletion, or addition, which substitutions may consist in whole or in part by conservative amino acid substitutions.",
                        "For instance, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated conservative amino acid substitution, such as replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine, will not have a major effect on the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Whether a change in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide results in a functional homolog may be readily determined by assessing the ability of the variant polypeptide to produce a response similar to that of the wild-type protein. Polypeptides in which more than one replacement has taken place may readily be tested in the same manner.",
                        "The term \u201cpurified\u201d refers to an object species that is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition). A \u201cpurified fraction\u201d is a composition wherein the object species is at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all species present. In making the determination of the purity of a species in solution or dispersion, the solvent or matrix in which the species is dissolved or dispersed is usually not included in such determination; instead, only the species (including the one of interest) dissolved or dispersed are taken into account. Generally, a purified composition will have one species that is more than about 80% of all species present in the composition, more than about 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more of all species present. The object species may be purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition is essentially a single species. A skilled artisan may purify a polypeptide of the invention using standard techniques for protein purification in light of the teachings herein. Purity of a polypeptide may be determined by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art, including for example, amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, gel electrophoresis, mass-spectrometry analysis and the methods described herein.",
                        "The terms \u201crecombinant protein\u201d or \u201crecombinant polypeptide\u201d refer to a polypeptide which is produced by recombinant DNA techniques. An example of such techniques includes the case when DNA encoding the expressed protein is inserted into a suitable expression vector which is in turn used to transform a host cell to produce the protein or polypeptide encoded by the DNA.",
                        "The term \u201cregulatory sequence\u201d is a generic term used throughout the specification to refer to polynucleotide sequences, such as initiation signals, enhancers, regulators and promoters, that are necessary or desirable to affect the expression of coding and non-coding sequences to which they are operably linked. Exemplary regulatory sequences are described in Goeddel, \u201cGene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology,\u201d Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990), and include, for example, the early and late promoters of SV40, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, the lac system, the trp system, the TAC or TRC system, T7 promoter whose expression is directed by T7 RNA polymerase, the major operator and promoter regions of phage lambda, the control regions for fd coat protein, the promoter for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, the promoters of acid phosphatase (e.g., PhoS), the promoters of the yeast \u03b1-mating factors, the polyhedron promoter of the baculovirus system and other sequences known to control the expression of genes of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses, and various combinations thereof. The nature and use of such control sequences may differ depending upon the host organism. In prokaryotes, such regulatory sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequences. The term \u201cregulatory sequence\u201d is intended to include, at a minimum, components whose presence may influence expression, and may also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. In certain embodiments, transcription of a polynucleotide sequence is under the control of a promoter sequence (or other regulatory sequence) which controls the expression of the polynucleotide in a cell-type in which expression is intended. It will also be understood that the polynucleotide can be under the control of regulatory sequences which are the same or different from those sequences which control expression of the naturally-occurring form of the polynucleotide.",
                        "The term \u201csequence homology\u201d refers to the proportion of base matches between two nucleic acid sequences or the proportion of amino acid matches between two amino acid sequences. When sequence homology is expressed as a percentage, e.g., 50%, the percentage denotes the proportion of matches over the length of sequence from a desired sequence that is compared to some other sequence. Gaps (in either of the two sequences) are permitted to maximize matching; gap lengths of 15 bases or less are usually used, 6 bases or less are used more frequently, with 2 bases or less used even more frequently. The term \u201csequence identity\u201d means that sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis for nucleic acids or amino acid-by-amino acid basis for polypeptides) over a window of comparison. The term \u201cpercentage of sequence identity\u201d is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the comparison window, determining the number of positions at which the identical amino acids or nucleotides occur in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Methods to calculate sequence identity are known to those of skill in the art and described in further detail below.",
                        "The term \u201csoluble\u201d as used herein with reference to a polypeptide of the invention or other protein, means that upon expression in cell culture, at least some portion of the polypeptide or protein expressed remains in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell and does not fractionate with the cellular debris upon lysis and centrifugation of the lysate. Solubility of a polypeptide may be increased by a variety of art recognized methods, including fusion to a heterologous amino acid sequence, deletion of amino acid residues, amino acid substitution (e.g., enriching the sequence with amino acid residues having hydrophilic side chains), and chemical modification (e.g., addition of hydrophilic groups).",
                        "The solubility of polypeptides may be measured using a variety of art recognized techniques, including dynamic light scattering to determine aggregation state, UV absorption, centrifugation to separate aggregated from non-aggregated material, and SDS gel electrophoresis (e.g., the amount of protein in the soluble fraction is compared to the amount of protein in the soluble and insoluble fractions combined). When expressed in a host cell, the polypeptides of the invention may be at least about 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more soluble, e.g., at least about 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of the total amount of protein expressed in the cell is found in the cytoplasmic fraction.

                        "The term \u201cspecifically hybridizes\u201d refers to detectable and specific nucleic acid binding. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids of the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. Stringent conditions may be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence identity between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and nucleic acids of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or more (and every integer between 30 and 100).

Stringent conditions may be selected to be about 5\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for a given polynucleotide duplex at a defined ionic strength and pH. The length of the complementary polynucleotide strands and their GC content will determine the Tm of the duplex, and thus the hybridization conditions necessary for obtaining a desired specificity of hybridization. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a polynucleotide sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched complementary strand. In certain cases it may be desirable to increase the stringency of the hybridization conditions to be about equal to the Tm for a particular duplex.",
                        "A variety of techniques for estimating the Tm are available. Typically, G-C base pairs in a duplex are estimated to contribute about 3\u00b0 C. to the Tm, while A-T base pairs are estimated to contribute about 2\u00b0 C., up to a theoretical maximum of about 80-100\u00b0 C.",

Bacteriol. 159-870; Neuberger et al., (1984) Nature 312:604-608; Takeda et al., (1985) Nature 314:452-454) by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule specific for a polypeptide of the invention together with genes from an antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used; such antibodies are within the scope of this invention. Such chimeric antibodies are preferred for use in therapy of intestinal diseases or disorders (described infra), since the antibodies are much less likely than xenogenic antibodies to induce an immune response, in particular an allergic response, themselves.",

No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies specific for a polypeptide of the invention. An additional embodiment of the invention utilizes the techniques described for the construction of Fab expression libraries (Huse et al., (1989) Science 246:1275-1281) to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for a polypeptide of the invention.",
                        "Antibody fragments, which contain the idiotype of the antibody molecule, can be generated by known techniques.

                        "In the production of antibodies, screening for the desired antibody can be accomplished by techniques known in the art, e.g., radioimmunoassay, ELISA, \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoradiometric assays, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, in situ immunoassays (using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example), Western blots, precipitation reactions, agglutination assays (e.g., gel agglutination assays, hemagglutination assays), complement fixation assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein A assays, immunoelectrophoresis assays, etc. In one embodiment, antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment, the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment, the secondary antibody is labeled. Many means are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention. For example, to select antibodies that recognize a specific epitope of a polypeptide of the invention, one may assay generated hybridomas for a product that binds to a fragment of a polypeptide of the invention containing such epitope.",

This reaction is because Ab1, raised in one mammalian species, has been used in another species as an antigen to raise the antibody, Ab2. For example, Ab2 may be raised in goats using rabbit antibodies as antigens. Ab2 therefore would be anti-rabbit antibody raised in goats. For purposes of this description and claims, Ab1 will be referred to as a primary antibody, and Ab2 will be referred to as a secondary or anti-Abp antibody.",

                        "In one form of the invention, the target nucleic acid sequence is amplified by PCR and then detected using any of the specific methods mentioned above. Other useful diagnostic techniques for detecting the presence of polynucleotide sequences include, but are not limited to: 1) allele-specific PCR; 2) single stranded conformation analysis; 3) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; 4) RNase protection assays; 5) the use of proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches, such as the E. coli mutS protein; 6) allele-specific oligonucleotides; and 7) fluorescent in situ hybridisation.",

When probes are used to detect the presence of the desired polynucleotide sequences, the biological sample to be analyzed, such as blood or serum, may be treated, if desired, to extract the nucleic acids. The sample polynucleotide sequences may be prepared in various ways to facilitate detection of the target sequence; e.g. denaturation, restriction digestion, electrophoresis or dot blotting. The targeted region of the sample polynucleotide sequence usually must be at least partially single-stranded to form hybrids with the targeting sequence of the probe. If the sequence is naturally single-stranded, denaturation will not be required. However, if the sequence is double-stranded, the sequence will probably need to be denatured. Denaturation can be carried out by various techniques known in the art.",
                        "Sample polynucleotide sequences and probes are incubated under conditions that promote stable hybrid formation of the target sequence in the probe with the putative desired polynucleotide sequence in the sample.

Alternatively, the probe may be unlabeled, but may be detectable by specific binding with a ligand that is labeled, either directly or indirectly. Suitable labels and methods for labeling probes and ligands are known in the art, and include, for example, radioactive labels which may be incorporated by known methods (e.g., nick translation, random priming or kinasing), biotin, fluorescent groups, chemiluminescent groups (e.g., dioxetanes, particularly triggered dioxetanes), enzymes, antibodies and the like. Variations of this basic scheme are known in the art, and include those variations that facilitate separation of the hybrids to be detected from extraneous materials and/or that amplify the signal from the labeled moiety.",

                        "Techniques for producing immobilized libraries of DNA molecules have been described in the art. Generally, most prior art methods describe the synthesis of single-stranded nucleic acid molecule libraries, using for example masking techniques to build up various permutations of sequences at the various discrete positions on the solid substrate. U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,832 describes an improved method for producing DNA arrays immobilized to silicon substrates based on very large scale integration technology. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,832 describes a strategy called \u201ctiling\u201d to synthesize specific sets of probes at spatially defined locations on a substrate that may be used to produce the immobilized DNA libraries of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,832 also provides references for earlier techniques that may also be used. Thus, polynucleotide sequence probes may be synthesized in situ on the surface of the substrate.",
                        "Alternatively, single-stranded molecules may be synthesized off the solid substrate and each pre-formed sequence applied to a discrete position on the solid substrate. For example, polynucleotide sequences may be printed directly onto the substrate using robotic devices equipped with either pins or pizo electric devices.",
                        "The library sequences are typically immobilized onto or in discrete regions of a solid substrate. The substrate may be porous to allow immobilization within the substrate or substantially non-porous, in which case the library sequences are typically immobilized on the surface of the substrate. The solid substrate may be made of any material to which polypeptides can bind, either directly or indirectly. Examples of suitable solid substrates include flat glass, silicon wafers, mica, ceramics and organic polymers such as plastics, including polystyrene and polymethacrylate. It may also be possible to use semi-permeable membranes such as nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, which are widely available. The semi-permeable membranes may be mounted on a more robust solid surface such as glass. The surfaces may optionally be coated with a layer of metal, such as gold, platinum or other transition metal.",
                        "Preferably, the solid substrate is generally a material having a rigid or semi-rigid surface. In preferred embodiments, at least one surface of the substrate will be substantially flat, although in some embodiments it may be desirable to physically separate synthesis regions for different polymers with, for example, raised regions or etched trenches. It is also preferred that the solid substrate is suitable for the high density application of DNA sequences in discrete areas of typically from 50 to 100 \u03bcm, giving a density of 10000 to 40000 dots/cm\u22122.",
                        "The solid substrate is conveniently divided up into sections. This may be achieved by techniques such as photoetching, or by the application of hydrophobic inks, for example teflon-based inks (Cel-line, USA).",

                        "Attachment of the polynucleotide sequences to the substrate may be by covalent or non-covalent means. The polynucleotide sequences may be attached to the substrate via a layer of molecules to which the library sequences bind. For example, the polynucleotide sequences may be labeled with biotin and the substrate coated with avidin and/or streptavidin. A convenient feature of using biotinylated polynucleotide sequences is that the efficiency of coupling to the solid substrate can be determined easily. Since the polynucleotide sequences may bind only poorly to some solid substrates, it is often necessary to provide a chemical interface between the solid substrate (such as in the case of glass) and the nucleic acid sequences. Examples of suitable chemical interfaces include hexaethylene glycol. Another example is the use of polylysine coated glass, the polylysine then being chemically modified using standard procedures to introduce an affinity ligand. Other methods for attaching molecules to the surfaces of solid substrates by the use of coupling agents are known in the art (see, for example, WO98/49557).",
                        "Binding of complementary polynucleotide sequences to the immobilized nucleic acid library may be determined by a variety of means such as changes in the optical characteristics of the bound polynucleotide sequence (i.e. by the use of ethidium bromide) or by the use of labeled nucleic acids, such as polypeptides labeled with fluorophores. Other detection techniques that do not require the use of labels include optical techniques such as optoacoustics, reflectometry, ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance (see WO97/49989).",

This strain has been well-characterised and shown to be virulent following experimental challenge of pigs. The cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method is used to prepare high quality chromosomal DNA suitable for preparation of genomic DNA libraries. B. hyodysenteriae is grown in 100 ml anaerobic trypticase soy broth culture to a cell density of 109 cells/ml. The cells are harvested at 4,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes, and the cell pellet resuspended in 9.5 ml TE buffer. SDS is added to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v), and the cells lysed at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour with 100 \u03bcg of Proteinase K. NaCl is added to a final concentration of 0.7 M and 1.5 ml CTAB/NaCl solution (10% w/v CTAB, 0.7 M NaCl) is added before incubating the solution at 65\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. The lysate is extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and the tube is centrifuged at 6,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes to separate the phases. The aqueous phase is transferred to a fresh tube and 0.6 volumes of isopropanol are added to precipitate the high molecular weight DNA. The precipitated DNA is collected using a hooked glass rod and transferred to a tube containing 1 ml of 70% (v/v) ethanol. The tube is centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g and the pelleted DNA redissolved in 4 ml TE buffer overnight. A cesium chloride gradient containing 1.05 g/ml CsCl and 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide is prepared using the redissolved DNA solution. The gradient is transferred to 4 ml sealable centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 70,000\u00d7g overnight at 15\u00b0 C. The separated DNA is visualized under an ultraviolet light, and the high molecular weight DNA is withdrawn from the gradient using a 15-g needle. The ethidium bromide is removed from the DNA by sequential extraction with CsCl-saturated isopropanol. The purified chromosomal DNA is dialysed against 2 litres TE buffer and precipitated with isopropanol. The resuspended genomic DNA is sheared using a GeneMachines Hydroshear (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, Mich.), and the sheared DNA is filled in using Klenow DNA polymerase to generate blunt-end fragments. One hundred ng of the blunt-end DNA fragments is ligated with 25 ng of pSMART VC vector (Lucigen, Meddleton, Wis.) using CloneSmart DNA ligase. The ligated DNA is then electroporated into E. coli electrocompetent cells. A small insert (2-3 kb) library and medium insert (3-10 kb) library is constructed into the low copy version of the pSMART VC vector.",

The purified plasmids are subjected to automated direct sequencing of the pSMART VC vector using the forward and reverse primers specific for the pSMART VC vector. Each sequencing reaction is performed in a 10 \u03bcl volume consisting of 200 ng of plasmid DNA, 2 pmol of primer, and 4 \u03bcl of the ABI PRISM\u2122 BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Mix (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Cycling conditions involve a 2 minute denaturing step at 96\u00b0 C., followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 96\u00b0 C. for 10 seconds, and a combined primer annealing and extension step at 60\u00b0 C. for 4 minutes. Residual dye terminators are removed from the sequencing products by precipitation with 95% (v/v) ethanol containing 85 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 3 mM EDTA (pH 8), and vacuum dried. The plasmids are sequenced in duplicate using each primer. Sequencing products are analyzed using an ABI 373A DNA Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems).",

Open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted using a variety of programs including GeneMark, GLIMMER, ORPHEUS, SELFID and GetORF. Putative ORFs are examined for homology (DNA and protein) with existing international databases using searches including BLAST and FASTA. All the predicted ORFs are analyzed to determine their cellular localization using programs including PSI-BLAST, FASTA, MOTIFS, FINDPATTERNS, PHD, SIGNALP and PSORT. Databases including Interpro, Prosite, ProDom, Pfam and Blocks are used to predict surface associated proteins such as transmembrane domains, leader peptides, homologies to known surface proteins, lipoprotein signature, outer membrane anchoring motifs and host cell binding domains. Phylogenetic and other molecular evolution analysis is conducted with the identified genes and with other species to assist in the assignment of function. The in silico analysis of both partially sequenced genomes produces a comprehensive list of all the predicted ORFs present in the sequence data available. Each ORF is interrogated for descriptive information, such as predicted molecular weight, isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, and subcellular localization to enable correlation with the in vitro properties of the native gene product. Predicted genes which encode proteins similar to surface localized components and/or virulence factors in other pathogenic bacteria are selected as potential vaccine targets.",

Table 1 shows 33 genes selected as potential vaccine targets and their similarity with other known amino acid sequences obtained from SWISS-PROT database. It is noted that the percent identity of amino acids does not raise above 58% while the percent similarity or homology of amino acids remains less than 71%, thus indicating that these ORFs are unique.",
