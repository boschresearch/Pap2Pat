                        "Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with transcriptional signatures. Over nine million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB), and 1.4 million deaths from TB, are estimated to occur around the world every year (1). One of the difficulties of curing pulmonary TB is the ability to diagnose the disease from other similar pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary sarcoidosis, community acquired pneumonia and lung cancer. TB and sarcoidosis are widespread multisystem diseases that preferentially involve the lung and present in a very similar clinical, radiological and histological manner. Distinguishing these diseases therefore often requires an invasive biopsy.",
                        "Granuloma formation is fundamental to both these diseases and although the aetiology of TB is well-recognised as the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the predominant cause of sarcoidosis remains unknown (2). The underlying pathways of granulomatous inflammation are also poorly understood and there is little understanding of disease-specific differences. Both sarcoidosis and TB can affect adults within the same age group, who then present with similar pulmonary symptoms and radiological thoracic abnormalities (3, 4). TB can also display a similar presentation to other pulmonary infectious diseases such as community acquired pneumonia and other lung inflammatory disorders such as primary lung cancer. Due to the complexity of these diseases a systems biology approach offers the ability to help unravel the principal host immune responses. Peripheral blood has the capacity to reflect pathological and immunological changes in the body, and identification of disease-associated alterations can be determined by a blood transcriptional signature (5). In addition the applicants have published a IFN-inducible neutrophil blood transcriptional signature in active TB patients that is absent in the majority of latent individuals and healthy controls, that correlates significantly with the extent of lung radiographic disease (5) and is diminished upon treatment (5, 12).",
                        "Blood gene expression profiling has been successfully applied to other infectious and inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), to help understand disease mechanisms and improve diagnosis and treatment (5). Two recent studies have used blood transcriptional profiling for the comparison of pulmonary TB and sarcoidosis; both studies found the diseases had similar transcriptional responses, which involved the overexpression of IFN-inducible genes (9, 10). However, these studies did not differentiate signatures from other pulmonary diseases leaving to question if the transcriptional signatures were non-specific for pulmonary disorders."

These arrays, also described as \u201cmicroarrays\u201d or \u201cgene-chips\u201d that may have 10,000; 20,000, 30,000; or 40,000 different identifiable genes based on the known genome, e.g., the human genome. These pan-arrays are used to detect the entire \u201ctranscriptome\u201d or transcriptional pool of genes that are expressed or found in a sample, e.g., nucleic acids that are expressed as RNA, mRNA and the like that may be subjected to RT and/or RT-PCR to made a complementary set of DNA replicons.

                        "As used herein, the term \u201cdisease\u201d refers to a physiological state of an organism with any abnormal biological state of a cell. Disease includes, but is not limited to, an interruption, cessation or disorder of cells, tissues, body functions, systems or organs that may be inherent, inherited, caused by an infection, caused by abnormal cell function, abnormal cell division and the like. A disease that leads to a \u201cdisease state\u201d is generally detrimental to the biological system, that is, the host of the disease. With respect to the present invention, any biological state, such as an infection (e.g., viral, bacterial, fungal, helminthic, etc.), inflammation, autoinflammation, autoimmunity, anaphylaxis, allergies, premalignancy, malignancy, surgical, transplantation, physiological, and the like that is associated with a disease or disorder is considered to be a disease state. A pathological state is generally the equivalent of a disease state. Disease states may also be categorized into different levels of disease state. As used herein, the level of a disease or disease state is an arbitrary measure reflecting the progression of a disease or disease state as well as the physiological response upon, during and after treatment. Generally, a disease or disease state will progress through levels or stages, wherein the affects of the disease become increasingly severe. The level of a disease state may be impacted by the physiological state of cells in the sample. As used herein, the terms \u201cmodule\u201d, \u201cmodular transcriptional vectors\u201d, or \u201cvectors of gene expression\u201d refer to transcriptional expression data that reflects a proportion of differentially expressed genes having a common gene expression pathway (e.g., interferon inducible genes), are typically expressed only or predominantly in a certain cell type (e.g., genes expressed by neutrophils), or are grouped into a module of genes to yield, in the aggregate a single vector of gene expression, such that the overall expression is expressed as a single vector that includes both a direction (under expressed or over expressed) and intensity of the under or over expression. For example, for each module the proportion of transcripts differentially expressed between at least two groups (e.g., healthy subjects versus patients, or certain patients of a first disease versus a group of patients with a second disease). The vector of expression is derived from the comparison of two or more groups of samples. The first analytical step is used for the selection of disease-specific sets of transcripts within each module. Next, there is the \u201cexpression level.\u201d The group comparison for a given disease provides the list of differentially expressed transcripts for each module. It was found that different diseases yield different subsets of modular transcripts. With this expression level it is then possible to calculate a vector of expression for each of the module(s) for a single sample by averaging expression values of disease-specific subsets of genes identified as being differentially expressed. This approach permits the generation of maps of modular expression vectors for a single sample, e.g., those described in the module maps disclosed herein. These vector of expression or module maps represent an averaged expression level for each module (instead of a proportion of differentially expressed genes) that can be derived for each sample. An example of the vector of gene expression is shown in, e.g., FIG. 6A.",
                        "Using the present invention it is possible to identify and distinguish pulmonary diseases not only at the module-level, but also at the gene-level; i.e., two, three or four diseases can have for certain modules the same vector (identical proportion of differentially expressed transcripts, identical \u201cpolarity\u201d), but the gene composition of the vector can still be disease-specific, and vice versa. Gene-level expression provides the distinct advantage of greatly increasing the resolution of the analysis.",
                        "Gene expression monitoring systems for use with the present invention may include customized gene arrays with a limited and/or basic number of genes that are specific and/or customized for the one or more target diseases. Unlike the general, pan-genome arrays that are in customary use, the present invention provides for not only the use of these general pan-arrays for retrospective gene and genome analysis without the need to use a specific platform, but more importantly, it provides for the development of customized arrays that provide an optimal gene set for analysis without the need for the thousands of other, non-relevant genes. One distinct advantage of the optimized arrays and modules of the present invention over the existing art is a reduction in the financial costs (e.g., cost per assay, materials, equipment, time, personnel, training, etc.), and more importantly, the environmental cost of manufacturing pan-arrays where the vast majority of the data is irrelevant. The modules of the present invention allow for the first time the design of simple, custom arrays that provide optimal data with the least number of probes while maximizing the signal to noise ratio. By eliminating the total number of genes for analysis, it is possible to, e.g., eliminate the need to manufacture thousands of expensive platinum masks for photolithography during the manufacture of pan-genetic chips that provide vast amounts of irrelevant data.

The cellular constituent may be on or off (present or absent), upregulated relative to a reference or downregulated relative to the reference. For use with gene-chips or gene-arrays, differential gene expression of nucleic acids, e.g., mRNA or other RNAs (miRNA, siRNA, hnRNA, rRNA, tRNA, etc.) may be used to distinguish between cell types or nucleic acids.

A therapeutic regimen may include a prescribed dosage of one or more drugs or surgery. Therapies will most often be beneficial and reduce the disease state but in many instances the effect of a therapy will have non-desirable or side-effects.

The pharmacological state of a sample relates to changes in the biological status before, during and/or after drug treatment and may serve as a diagnostic or prognostic function, as taught herein. Some changes following drug treatment or surgery may be relevant to the disease state and/or may be unrelated side-effects of the therapy. Changes in the pharmacological state are the likely results of the duration of therapy, types and doses of drugs prescribed, degree of compliance with a given course of therapy, and/or un-prescribed drugs ingested.",

                        "Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). However, the majority of individuals infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, retaining the infection in a latent form and it is thought that this latent state is maintained by an active immune response. Blood is the pipeline of the immune system, and as such is the ideal biologic material from which the health and immune status of an individual can be established.",
                        "Blood represents a reservoir and a migration compartment for cells of the innate and the adaptive immune systems, including neutrophils, dendritic cells and monocytes, or B and T lymphocytes, respectively, which during infection will have been exposed to infectious agents in the tissue. For this reason whole blood from infected individuals provides an accessible source of clinically relevant material where an unbiased molecular phenotype can be obtained using gene expression microarrays for the study of cancer in tissues autoimmunity), and inflammation, infectious disease, or in blood or tissue. Microarray analyses of gene expression in blood leucocytes have identified diagnostic and prognostic gene expression signatures, which have led to a better understanding of mechanisms of disease onset and responses to treatment. These microarray approaches have been attempted for the study of active and latent TB but as yet have yielded small numbers of differentially expressed genes only, and in relatively small numbers of patients, therefore not reaching statistical significance, which may not be robust enough to distinguish between other inflammatory and infectious diseases. The present inventors recognized that a neutrophil driven blood transcriptional signature in active TB patients was missing in the majority of Latent TB individuals and in healthy controls. For this description see, also, the study of Berry et al., 2010 (5), by the present inventors. This signature of active TB was reflective of lung radiographic disease and was diminished after 2 months of treatment (5) and more recently the present inventors have shown that the blood transcriptional signature of TB was diminished as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment (12). The signature was dominated by interferon-inducible genes, and at a modular level the active TB signature (5, 12) was distinct from other infectious or autoimmune diseases (5).",
                        "In the present findings and the basis of this application the blood transcriptional profiles of the pulmonary granulomatous diseases (TB and sarcoidosis) clustered together but distinctly from the similar pulmonary diseases pneumonia and lung cancer.",
                        "It has previously been shown that TB and sarcoidosis have similar transcriptional profiles however no published studies have determined if this similar blood gene expression profile is due to generalized transcriptional activity associated with pulmonary diseases or due to specific host responses associated with TB and sarcoidosis. Therefore, we recruited three cohorts of TB and sarcoidosis patients (Training, Test and Validation Sets) alongside patients with similar pulmonary diseases community acquired pneumonia and lung cancer. On average the sarcoidosis patients presented with a milder and more chronic presentation than the TB and pneumonia patients. There was little difference in the demographics and clinical characteristics of the participants in the Training and Test Sets.",
                        "Unbiased analysis followed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the blood transcriptional profiles from all the Training Set participants clearly demonstrated that the TB and sarcoidosis patients transcriptional profiles clustered together but distinctly from the pneumonia and cancer patients transcriptional profiles which themselves clustered together (3422 transcripts). Adding a statistical filter generated 1446 differentially expressed transcripts. Applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 1446-transcripts and the Training Set samples again showed the same clustering pattern. This finding was verified in an independent cohort, the Test Set, which likewise showed the TB and most sarcoidosis patients clustered together while the pneumonia and lung cancer patients also clustered together but separately from the granulomatous diseases (FIG. 1). Clustering was not influenced by ethnicity or gender (data not shown).",

The clustering of the 1446-transcripts were tested in an independent cohort from which they were derived from, the Test Set. The heatmap shows the transcripts and patients' profiles as organised by the unbiased algorithm of unsupervised hierarchical clustering.

The 1446 unsupervised clustering revealed three main clusters of transcripts as can be seen from the vertical dendrogram (FIG. 2). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the main clusters of transcripts revealed that the TB and sarcoidosis samples were associated with over-abundance of the interferon signalling pathway and other immune response pathways (FIG. 2). However the pneumonia and lung cancer samples were associated with over-abundance of pathways linked with inflammation. All four diseases associated with under-abundance of T and B cell pathways. Using the 1,446 genes or probes, the skilled artisan can select subsets of genes that will best differentiate between two, three or four pulmonary diseases by taking advantage of both the level of expression but also whether the gene is over- or under-expressed. As taught herein, certain subsets are demonstrated to be unique to certain pulmonary diseases, but can also be used to identify if a patient or subject has one, two, three or four of the pulmonary diseases.",

The top transcript cluster is over-abundant in the pneumonia and lung cancer patients and significantly associated with IPA pathways relating to inflammation (Fisher's exact p<0.05 Benjamini Hochberg). The middle transcript cluster is over-abundant in the TB and sarcoidosis patients and significantly associated with interferon signalling and other immune response IPA pathways (Fisher's exact p<0.05 Benjamini Hochberg). The bottom transcript cluster is under-abundant in all the patients and significantly associated with T and B cell IPA pathways (Fisher's exact p<0.05 Benjamini Hochberg).",

                        "From the unsupervised clustering of the 1446-transcripts it can be seen that the sarcoidosis patients fell into two groups, those that clustered with the TB patients and those that clustered with the healthy controls (FIG. 1). As the blood transcriptional profile is a snap shot view of the host's immune response we applied the same approach to clinically phenotyping the patients to understand if their clinical classification correlates with their transcriptional profile. However there is no consensus on how to reliably assess disease activity and current classification systems all require continuous follow-up of the patient over a prolonged period of time before their activity status can be stated (1). Therefore a clinical classification was devised decision tree based on clinical variables that are both routinely measure in sarcoidosis patients and have been shown to be associated with disease activity (data not shown). Using exactly the same analysis strategy as for the 1446-transcripts, but this time with the sarcoidosis patients classified as either active or non-active, 1396-transcripts were found to be differentially expressed across all the disease groups. FIGS. 3A and 3B shows the results from the sarcoidosis patients clinically classified as active sarcoidosis display similar transcriptional signatures to the TB patients but are very distinct from the transcriptional signatures of the clinically classified non-active sarcoidosis patients which in turn resemble the healthy controls. 1396-transcripts are differentially expressed in the whole blood of healthy controls, pulmonary TB patients, active sarcoidosis patients, non-active sarcoidosis patients, pneumonia patients and lung cancer patients. FIG. 3A shows the 1396 transcripts and Training Set patients' profiles are organised by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. A dotted line is added to the heatmap to clarify the main clusters generated by the clustering algorithm. Transcript intensity values are normalised to the median of all transcripts. FIG. 3B shows the molecular distance to health of the 1396 transcripts in the Training and Test sets demonstrates the quantification of transcriptional change relative to the controls. The mean and SEM was compared between each disease group (ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test).",
                        "Unsupervised hierarchical clustering again showed the same clustering pattern as seen with the 1446-transcripts (FIG. 3A). Applying the clinical classification decision tree it could be seen that those sarcoidosis patients clustering with the TB patients had been classified as active and those with the healthy controls as non-active. This was further validated in two independent cohorts, the Test and Validation Sets (data not shown). In addition, it was found that the applied clinical classification decision tree was able to predict if the sarcoidosis patients' transcriptional profiles clustered with the TB patients or the healthy controls better than any routinely measured single clinical variable (data not shown). Furthermore the clinical classification decision tree was still superior in its clustering predictive ability even if the single clinical variables with the highest predictive values were used in conjunction with each other or even when used together with the clinical classification criteria (data not shown). Molecular distance to health (MDTH) demonstrates the quantification of transcriptional change relative to the controls (FIG. 3B) (2). By applying this algorithm to all the disease groups for the 1396-transcripts it could be seen that the non-active sarcoidosis MDTH score was not significantly different from the controls, however the active sarcoidosis MDTH score was significantly different from the controls. In addition the TB patients' MDTH score was significantly higher than active sarcoidosis patients' score. Lung cancer and pneumonia both had significantly higher scores than the controls with pneumonia significantly higher than cancer. Pneumonia and TB had the highest MDTH scores. The significant differences in the MDTH scores between the patient groups suggest there is a quantitative as well as qualitative difference in blood transcriptional signatures between these similar pulmonary diseases.",

                        "To further understand the biological pathways associated with each disease group we undertook three different data mining strategies to ensure our findings were robust and consistent. The three approaches applied were: modular analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and annotation of the top differentially expressed genes for each disease group.",
                        "To carry out modular analysis all detectable genes (15,212 transcripts) in the whole Training set dataset were analysed. Each module corresponds to a set of co-regulated genes that were assigned biological functions by unbiased literature profiling (3). FIGS. 4A to 4E shows modular analysis of the Training Set shows the similarity of the biological pathways associated with TB and sarcoidosis (particularly overexpression of the IFN modules), differing from pneumonia and lung cancer (particularly overexpression of the inflammation modules). FIG. 4A shows gene expression levels of all transcripts that were significantly detected compared to background hybridisation (15,212 transcripts, p<0.01) were compared in the Training Set between each patient group: TB, active sarcoidosis, non-active sarcoidosis, pneumonia, lung cancer, to the healthy controls. Each module corresponds to a set of co-regulated genes that were assigned biological functions by unbiased literature profiling. A red dot indicates significant over-abundance of transcripts and a blue dot indicates significant under-abundance (p<0.05). The colour intensity correlates with the percentage of genes in that module that are significantly differentially expressed. The modular analysis can also be represented in graphical form as shown in 4B-E, including both the Training and Test Set samples. FIG. 4B shows the percentage of genes significantly overexpressed in the 3 IFN modules for each disease. FIG. 4C shows the fold change of the expression of the genes present in the IFN modules compared to the controls. FIG. 4D shows the percentage of genes significantly overexpressed in the 5 inflammation modules for each disease. FIG. 4E shows the fold change of the expression of the genes present in the inflammation modules compared to the controls. TB and active sarcoidosis show significant overexpression of the IFN modules compared to the other pulmonary disease groups (FIG. 4A). In contrast the pneumonia and cancer patients showed significant overexpression of the inflammation modules compared to TB and active sarcoidosis. These findings were then verified by modular analysis of the Test Set (Figure E7). The modular analysis therefore also substantiates our results determined from pathways linked to the 1446-transcripts signature described earlier (FIG. 2). TB patients showed a significant increase in the number of IFN genes (FIG. 4B), and their degree of expression (FIG. 4C), compared to the active sarcoidosis patients, demonstrating a quantitative difference in the IFN-inducible signature between TB and active sarcoidosis (FIG. 4B-C) The same genes in the IFN module that were overexpressed in the active sarcoidosis patients were also overexpressed in the TB patients (data not shown). Pneumonia and lung cancer showed a significant increase in the number of genes present in the inflammation modules (FIG. 4D), and their degree of expression (FIG. 4E), in comparison to TB and active sarcoidosis (FIG. 4A, D-E). Pneumonia patients also showed a significant overexpression of the number of genes present in the neutrophil module compared to all the other pulmonary diseases (Figure E8). Whole blood gene expression may correlate with the blood's cell composition or with the gene expression in particular cellular populations. For the neutrophil genes there was a significant correlation between the neutrophil module and the neutrophil count for all the pneumonia patients versus controls (Pearson's correlation, p<0.0001). The second data mining approach, comparison IPA, only used those genes that were differentially expressed between each disease group and a set of controls matched by ethnicity and gender (\u22671.5 fold change from the mean of the controls, Mann Whitney Benjamini Hochberg p<0.01; TB=2524, active sarcoidosis=1391, pneumonia=2801 and lung cancer=1626 differentially expressed transcripts). FIG. 5A shows a comparison Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the four disease groups compared to their matched controls reveals the four most significant pathways. Differentially expressed genes were derived from the Training Set by comparing each disease to healthy controls matched for ethnicity and gender: TB=2524, active sarcoidosis=1391, pneumonia=2801 and lung cancer=1626 transcripts (\u22671.5 fold change from the mean of the controls, Mann Whitney Benjamini Hochberg p<0.01). FIG. 5A shows the IPA canonical pathways was used to determined the most significant pathways (i-iv) associated with each disease relative to the other diseases (Fisher's exact Benjamini Hochberg). The bottom x-axis and bars of each graph indicates the log(p-value) and the top x-axis and line indicates the percentage of genes present in the pathway. The genes in the EIF2 signalling pathway are predominately under-abundant genes however the genes in the other three pathways are predominantly over-abundant relative to the controls. Pathways above the blue dotted line are significant (p<0.05). FIGS. 5B, 5C and 5D show the interferon signalling IPA pathway is overlaid onto each disease group. Coloured genes are differentially expressed in that disease group compared to their matched controls (Fisher's exact p<0.05). Red genes represent over-abundance and green under-abundance.",
                        "The Comparison IPA reveals the most significant pathways when comparing across the diseases. The top four significant pathways were related to protein synthesis (EIF2 signalling) and immune response pathways (interferon signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses and antigen presentation pathway)(FIG. 5A). The prominence of the EIF2 signalling pathway was driven by the pneumonia patients. The genes were significantly under-abundant in the pneumonia patients compared to the other pulmonary diseases. Many other genes related to protein synthesis (including eukaryotic initiation factors and ribosomal proteins) and the unfolded protein response (a stress response to excessive protein synthesis), were also significantly under-abundant in the pneumonia patients compared to the other pulmonary diseases, e.g. PERK, CHOP, ABCE1 (data not shown). The significance of the three immune response pathways was driven predominantly by the TB patients, but also by the sarcoidosis patients. The pathways were more significant (bottom x-axis bar graph in FIG. 5A) and contained a higher number of genes (top x-axis line graph in FIG. 5A) in both TB and active sarcoidosis than compared to the other pulmonary diseases, again demonstrating the similarity of the biological pathways underlying these pulmonary granulomatous diseases. However the interferon signalling pathway was more significant (bottom x-axis bar graph FIG. 5A) and contained a higher number of genes in the TB than the active sarcoidosis patients and were not represented in pneumonia and lung cancer (top x-axis line graph FIG. 5A, FIG. 5B and FIG. 5C).",
                        "The third data mining strategy just examined the top 50 over-abundant differentially expressed transcripts for each disease. It could be seen that the transcripts correlate well with the findings from the modular and IPA analysis as both the TB and active sarcoidosis top 50 over-abundant transcripts were dominated by IFN-inducible genes e.g. IFITM3 (SEQ ID NO.:989), IFIT3 (SEQ ID NO.:1279), GBP1 (SEQ ID NO.:226), GBP6 (SEQ ID NO.:1409), CXCL10 (SEQ ID NO.:1298), OAS1 (SEQ ID NO.:790), STAT1 (SEQ ID NO.:995), IFI44L (SEQ ID NO.:1013), FCGR1B (SEQ ID NO.:63) (Table 6). However the expression fold change was much higher in the TB patients than the active sarcoidosis patients. In addition the pneumonia top 50 over-abundant transcripts were dominated by antimicrobial neutrophil-related genes e.g., ELANE (SEQ ID NO.:330), DEFA1B (SEQ ID NO.:1024), MMP8 (SEQ ID NO.:521), CAMP (SEQ ID NO.:40), DEFA3 (SEQ ID NO.:1088), DEFA4 (SEQ ID NO.:231), MPO (SEQ ID NO.:1287), LTF (SEQ ID NO.:506). The genes FCGR1A, B and C ((SEQ ID NO.:1109, 63, 50, respectively)) were over-abundant in the top 50 transcripts of all four pulmonary diseases. A 4-set Venn diagram of the differentially expressed genes was able to demonstrate the unique genes for each disease group (FIG. 9 and Table 7). There were over three times the number of unique TB genes than unique active sarcoidosis genes of which only the TB unique genes were significantly associated with the IPA IFN-signalling pathway. The unique pneumonia genes were associated with an under-abundance of pathways related to protein synthesis. The unique lung cancer genes were associated with over-abundance of inflammation related pathways. The overlapping genes common to all four disease groups were significantly associated with under-abundance of T and B cell pathways.",
                        "TB and pneumonia patients after treatment showed a diminishment of their transcriptional profiles to resemble the controls however the sarcoidosis patients who respond to glucocorticoids showed a significant increase in their transcriptional activity.",
                        "FIGS. 6A to 6D show both modular analysis and molecular distance to health reveal that the blood transcriptome of the pneumonia and TB patients after successfully completing treatment are no different from the healthy controls however the sarcoidosis patients show an overexpression of inflammation genes during a clinically successful response to glucocorticoids. FIG. 6A shows a modular analysis for gene expression levels of all transcripts that were significantly detected compared to background hybridisation (p<0.01) were compared between the healthy controls and each of the following the patient groups: pre-treatment pneumonia, post-treatment pneumonia patients and pre-treatment sarcoidosis, inadequate treatment response sarcoidosis and good treatment response sarcoidosis patients. A red dot indicates significant over-abundance of transcripts and a blue dot indicates under-abundance (p<0.05). The colour intensity correlates with the percentage of genes in that module that are significantly differentially expressed. MDTH demonstrates the quantification of transcriptional change after treatment in the 1446-transcripts relative to controls for pre-treatment pneumonia, post-treatment pneumonia patients, pre-treatment TB and post-treatment TB and and pre-treatment sarcoidosis, inadequate treatment response sarcoidosis and good treatment response sarcoidosis patients. The mean and SEM was compared between each disease group (ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test). FIG. 6B, Pneumonia patients; FIG. 6C, TB patients from the Bloom et al, 2012 (12), study carried out in South Africa, the controls in this study were participants with latent TB; FIG. 6D Sarcoidosis patients.",
                        "More specifically, having determined the blood transcriptional signatures of untreated patients with the pulmonary granulomatous diseases TB and sarcoidosis and the infectious disease community and acute lung diseases of acquired pneumonia we next sought to examine their transcriptional response to treatment. The pneumonia patients were all followed-up at least 6 weeks after their hospital discharge and showed a good clinical response to their treatment with standard antibiotics (clinical data not shown but available). Using two completely different data mining strategies, modular analysis (all detectable transcripts were analysed) and MDTH (only the 1446-transcripts were analysed), it could be seen that the pneumonia patients after successful treatment showed a reversal of their transcriptional profiles such that there was no significant difference between the pneumonia post-treatment transcriptional profiles and the healthy controls (FIGS. 6A & B). We have previously studied the blood transcriptional response of a cohort of active TB patients from South Africa before and after successful anti-TB treatment (4). Therefore we used the same 1446-transcripts that were derived from this present study to assess the transcriptional response of these South African TB patients before and after treatment, compared to their latent TB controls. The MDTH score of the untreated active TB patients were significantly different from the latent TB controls however the transcriptional response after treatment again reversed with no significant difference between the treated active TB patients and the latent TB controls (FIG. 6C).",
                        "The treated sarcoidosis patients showed a variable clinical response after immunosuppressive treatment initiation as determined by their practising physician (clinical data not shown but available). If the physician increased their treatment at their clinic follow-up the patient was categorised as having an \u2018inadequate treatment response\u2019 but if the physician continued the same treatment or reduced their treatment this was categorised as having a \u2018good treatment response\u2019. Applying the same two data mining strategies as used for the pneumonia patients it could clearly be seen that the sarcoidosis patients who had a good clinical response to glucocorticoids had a significant overexpression of inflammatory genes that was not seen when the same or the different sarcoidosis patients had an inadequate response to immunosuppressive treatment (FIGS. 6A & D). The majority of the inflammatory genes that were overexpressed in the untreated pneumonia and lung cancer patients were also overexpressed in the good-treatment response sarcoidosis patients (Table 8), but many more transcripts were overexpressed in the good-treatment response sarcoidosis patients (clinical data not shown but available). The term inflammation comprises many forms and therefore there is a diversity of genes that are called inflammatory. Interestingly many of the top 50 overexpressed inflammatory genes in the good-treatment response sarcoidosis patients are known to be anti-inflammatory genes which are invariably induced alongside proinflammatory genes in what is termed an inflammatory response, e.g., IL1R2 (SEQ ID NO.:1007), DUSP1, IL18R (SEQ ID NO.:239), C-FOS, I\u03baB\u03b1 and MAPK1, as well as pro-inflammatory genes (Table 8).",
                        "The interferon-inducible genes were most abundant in the neutrophils in both TB and sarcoidosis. It was previously shown in the Berry, et al., 2010 publication (5) that the active TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven IFN-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-\u03b3 and type I IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 signalling (5). Therefore the inventors identified the main cell populations driving the IFN-inducible signature in the active sarcoidosis patients. A new cohort of patients (TB and active sarcoidosis) were recruited and controls to test the same IFN-inducible genes as used in the Berry, et al., 2010 publication (5) in the purified leucocyte populations of TB and sarcoidosis patients who had an IFN-inducible signature present in whole blood (Table 9).",

FIG. 7A is a heatmap that shows the expression of IFN-inducible transcripts, from the Berry, et al., 2010 study (5), for each disease group normalised to the controls for that cell type. FIG. 7B shows the expression fold change in the TB samples of the same IFN-inducible transcripts.

The neutrophils also had the highest abundance of IFN-inducible genes in the sarcoidosis patients, although to a lesser extent than was seen in the TB patients (FIGS. 7A, 7C & 7E).

                        "Although the transcriptional profiles of the TB and active sarcoidosis patients appeared very similar we wished to determine if a gene list could distinguish the TB samples, from all the other patient and control samples. Therefore we compared the TB transcriptional profiles to the most similar group, active sarcoidosis, to derive a set of differentially expressed genes. 144 transcripts were differentially expressed between the TB and active sarcoidosis transcriptional profiles from the Training Set (significance analysis of microarray q<0.05, fold change\u22671.5). Many of the transcripts were IFN-inducible genes and were all over-abundant in the TB profiles compared to the active sarcoidosis profiles (Table 2). Two recent publications also described gene lists that could distinguish TB from all sarcoidosis patients (7, 8). These previously published gene lists were derived from different cohorts and used different microarray platforms. We used a class prediction machine learned algorithm, support vector machines (SVM), to test our gene list and the two previously published gene lists for their ability to predict whether a transcriptional profile belonged to a TB patient or not. The prediction model is built using the transcriptional signature from samples with known disease-types to predict the classification of a new collection of samples. The SVM model should therefore be built in one study cohort and run in an independent cohort to prevent over-fitting the predictive signature. This was possible for all our cohorts. Where the study cohorts used a different microarray platform the SVM model had to be re-built in that cohort. However to reduce the effects of over-fitting the same parameters were used every time the SVM model was built.",
                        "The 144 Illumina transcripts showed good sensitivity (above 80%) and specificity (above 90%) in all three independent cohorts from our study (Training, Test and Validation Sets) and when using an external cohort from the Maertzdorf et al study. The 100 Agilent transcripts from the Maertzdorf et al 2012 study were also tested (7). Only 76 of these transcripts were recognised as genes by NIH DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool. The same SVM parameters as used earlier were then applied using the Maertzdorf et al transcripts in our three independent cohorts (Training, Test and Validation Sets). The sensitivity however was much lower (45-56%), with similar specificity (above 90%). The 50 genes from the Koth et al 2011 (7) study run using an Affymetrix platform were also tested. The same SVM parameters were again applied to all our independent cohorts (Training, Test and Validation Sets). The sensitivity of this gene list was also lower (75-45%), with similar specificity (above 87%), than for our 144-transcripts. Neither the Koth et al 2011 (7) or the Maertzdorf et al 2012 (8) studies reported testing their derived gene lists in independent cohorts. As these study tested the 144-transcripts list from the present applicants (Bloom, O'Garra et al., to be submitted), in both internal and external independent cohorts this is likely to have improved the validity of the transcript list as a discriminative marker, and may explain why there was little overlap between their gene lists or overlap with the present applicants' 144 gene list (Figure E10).

Comparison Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood, Calif.) was used to determine the most significant canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes of each disease relative to the other diseases (Fisher's exact FDR (Benjamini Hochberg)=0.05). The bottom x-axis and bars of each comparison IPA graph indicated the log(p-value) and the top x-axis and line indicated the percentage of genes present in the pathway.",
                        "Molecular distance to health (MDTH) was determined as previously described (12), and then applied to different transcriptional signatures. Transcriptional modular analysis was applied as previously described (12). The raw expression levels of all transcripts significantly detected from background hybridisation were compared between each sample and all the controls present in that dataset. The percentage of significantly expressed genes in each module were represented by the colour intensity (Student t-test, p<0.05), red indicates overexpression and blue indicates underexpression. The mean percentage of significant genes and the mean fold change of these genes compared to the controls in specified modules were also shown in graphical form. MDTH and modular analysis were calculated in Microsoft Excel 2010. GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows was used to generate the graphs.",
                        "Differentially expressed genes between the Training Set TB patients and active sarcoidosis patients were derived using the non-parametric Significance Analysis of Microarrays (q<0.05) and \u22671.5 fold expression change. Class prediction was performed within GeneSpring 11.5 using the machine learned algorithm support vector machines (SVM). The model was built using sample classifiers \u2018TB\u2019 or \u2018not TB\u2019. The SVM model should be built in one study cohort and run in an independent cohort to prevent over-fitting the predictive signature. This was possible for all the cohorts from our study. Where the study cohorts used a different microarray platform the SVM model had to be re-built in that cohort. To reduce the effects of over-fitting the same SVM parameters were always used. The kernel type used was linear, maximum iterations 100,000, cost 100, ratio 1 and validation type N-fold where N=3 with 10 repeats.",

In the multivariate regression analysis where there were missing data points (serum ACE and HRCT disease activity) to prevent list-wise deletion dummy variable adjustment was used.",
