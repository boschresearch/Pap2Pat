                        "The present invention is directed to a gas diffusion layer for use in a gas diffusion device, such as a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The gas diffusion layers are designed to be positioned adjacent to a catalyst layer in the fuel cell. The gas diffusion layer exhibits electron conductivity and gas diffusibility. The gas diffusion layer has a first major surface and a second major surface which is positioned opposite to the first major surface and having an interior between the first and second major surfaces. The gas diffusion layer comprises a porous carbon substrate which is directly fluorinated in the interior and is substantially free of fluorination on at least one of the first major surfaces or said second major surfaces.",

For example, at least about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, or 100% (or some range therebetween) of the surface area of the major surface that is designed to be in contact with the catalyst layer is not fluorinated.

                        "In another aspect, the gas diffusion layer contains less than about 2 at % fluorine. For example, the amount of fluorine in the gas diffusion layer is less than about 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, or 0.3 at % (or some range therebetween).",

                        "In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a fuel cell or device containing the gas diffusion layers of the present invention. The fuel cell comprises a membrane-electrode assembly including a hydrogen ion conductive polymer electrolyte membrane; a pair of catalyst layers sandwiching the polymer electrolyte membrane; and a pair of gas diffusion layers of the present invention disposed on the outer surfaces of the catalyst layers.",
                        "In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for making the gas diffusion layer. The method comprises the steps of providing a porous carbon substrate having a first major surface and a second major surface which is positioned opposite to the first major surface and having an interior between the first and second major surfaces; protecting at least one of the first major surface and the second major surface by contacting at least one surface with a protective layer; directly fluorinating the porous carbon substrate with fluorine gas; and removing the protective layer from at least one surface. The interior of the gas diffusion device is fluorinated and at least one major surface (preferably both major surfaces) is not substantially fluorinated.",
                        "In still another aspect, the direct fluorinating step occurs at a temperature of about 300 to 500\u00b0 C. (e.g., about 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, or 500\u00b0 C. or some range therebetween).",
                        "In yet another aspect, the direct fluorinating step occurs using a mixture of fluorine gas and an inert gas. The inert gas is preferably selected from the group consisting of argon and nitrogen. The amount of fluorine in the gaseous mixture is preferably between about 1 and 50% (e.g., about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50% or some range therebetween). In one aspect, the direction fluorinating step includes using a mixture of about 10 to 20% fluorine and 80 to 90% argon.",
                        "In a further aspect, the direct fluorinating step occurs at atmospheric pressure or an elevated pressure. Exemplary pressures include 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 atm.",
                        "In another aspect, the direct fluorinating step occurs for about 10 minutes to 5 hours (e.g., about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, or 300 minutes or some range therebetween).",
                        "In yet another aspect, during the direct fluorinating step, the first major surface is protected by contacting the first major surface with a first protective layer and the second major surface is protected by contacting the second major surface with a second protective layer such that the porous carbon substrate is sandwiched between the first protective layer and the second protective layer.",
                        "In another aspect, during the direct fluorinating step, the protective layer(s) are comprised of the same material comprising the porous carbon substrate. The protective layers may also be comprised of a different material, provided that protective layers are capable of contacting substantially all of the first or second major surfaces and are gas permeable. Theoretically, any porous materials that can withstand the temperature and fluorination environment, like porous glass, quartz, or Teflon, may be used.",
                        "In an alternative embodiment, the major surface(s) of the porous carbon substrate are not protected during the direct fluorination step. Thus, during the direct fluorination process, the outer carbon atomic layer of the carbon fibers are fluorinated. In this embodiment, the outer carbon atomic layers of the carbon fibers forming at least one of first and second major surfaces (preferably both surfaces) are removed such that the interior of the gas diffusion device is fluorinated and at least one major surface (preferably both major surfaces) is not substantially fluorinated. The removing step may be performed by physical or chemical methods, for example sanding, physical plasma etching with an argon plasma, or reactive ion etching.",
                        "In another aspect, the gas diffusion layer may be comprised of a single layer of material or a plurality of layers. In one aspect, the gas diffusion layer is a bilayer comprising a macroporous substrate and a microporous substrate. For example, the gas diffusion layer may comprise a macroporous carbon substrate adjacent to a microporous carbon substrate (which is typically comprised of carbon powder mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene (\u201cPTFE\u201d)). The gas diffusion bilayer may be directly fluorinated using the methods discussed herein (e.g., a sandwich method or physical/chemical removal of the outer carbon atomic layers, such as by sanding). In such an embodiment, the gas diffusion layer is a bilayer having a first major surface comprised of the microporous carbon substrate and a second major surface comprised of the macroporous carbon substrate which is positioned opposite to the first major surface and having an interior between the first and second major surfaces. The gas diffusion layer comprises a porous carbon substrate which is directly fluorinated in the interior and is substantially free of fluorination on at least one of the first major surfaces or second major surfaces. In another aspect, at least 50 percent of the surface area of the major surface of the microporous carbon substrate that is designed to be in contact with the catalyst layer is not fluorinated. For example, at least about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, or 100% (or some range therebetween) of the surface area of the major surface of the microporous layer is not fluorinated. As another example, at least about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, or 100% (or some range therebetween) of the surface area of both major surfaces (macroporous and microporous substrates) is not fluorinated.",

                        "A fuel cell is basically a generator apparatus that uses the reverse reaction of the water electrolysis to convert chemical energy into electric energy. Since the fuel cell has the advantages of low operation temperature, quick start, high energy density, low pollution, and a wide range of applications, the fuel cell has a high commercial value. It has become a successively developed and promoted technology all over the world. The commonly seen fuel cell includes the phosphoric acid fuel cell, direct methanol fuel cell, alkaline fuel cell, molten carbonate fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell, and proton exchange membrane fuel cell.",
                        "FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an internal structure of a typical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (\u201cPEMFC\u201d). As shown in FIG. 1, the PEMFC mainly includes a proton exchange membrane 100, catalyst layers 102, gas diffusion layers 104, and bipolar plates 106. During the PEMFC operation, the oxidation reaction of H2 is taking place at the anode 110, and the reduction reaction of O2 is taking place at the cathode 112. The reactant gas H2 at the anode 110 is decomposed into hydrogen ions (H+) and electrons (e\u2212) in the presence of a catalyst. The electrons (e\u2212) escape from the anode 110, flow through the cell external circuit 114 and load 115, then reach the cathode 112. Meanwhile, the hydrogen ions (H+) are transferred from the anode 110 to the cathode 112 through the proton exchange membrane 100. The hydrogen ions (H+) and the electrons (e\u2212) combine with the oxygen molecules (O2) at the cathode 112 to produce water (H2O).",
                        "During the fuel cell reaction, the H2O molecules will be continuously transferred from the anode 110 to the cathode 112 by electroosmotic drag. If the water cannot be supplied at adequate amount to the anode, the proton exchange membrane 100 will become excessively dry, the H+ conducting capability of the membrane will be reduced, and the power output of the fuel cell will be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, a great amount of water (H2O) will be produced by the oxygen reduction reaction (\u201cORR\u201d) at the cathode 112. If the water transferred from the anode to the cathode by electroosmotic drag and produced by ORR cannot be adequately discharged from the cell, the catalyst layer 102 and the gas diffusion layer 104 at the cathode 112 will be flooded with water. The gas diffusion layer filled with water becomes a diffusion barrier of oxygen. It retards the oxygen getting into the catalyst layer and the cell output power is significantly reduced. Therefore, controlling and maintaining the water balance in the cathode 112 and the anode 110 and keeping the gas transferring freely inside the electrodes, are critical for maintaining the performance of the PEMFC at its optimal condition.",
                        "The gas diffusion layer 104 is located between the catalyst layer 102 and the gas flow path. At the catalytic sites on each electrode, it is the gas diffusion layer 104 that provides both a path of electrical conduction and passage for reactants and products, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and water. That is, the gas diffusion layer is required to have high reaction gas permeability, high water permeability, and high electron conductivity.",
                        "The gas diffusion layer 104 must be porous in nature. The word porous generally refers to the volume of interstices of a material relative to the volume of the mass of the material. Porosity effects the state of permeability of a material, that is the property of a porous material that is the measure of the amount (rate or volume) at which a fluid (liquid or gas) passes through a unit of cross-section of material at a given viscosity, under a unit of gradient pressure. Therefore, at fixed gradient pressure, and viscosity, the permeability of a given material is directly related to its porosity. For purposes of this application, therefore, the terms porosity and permeability may be used interchangeably with the understanding that an increase in porosity (interstitial volume) will normally result in an increase in permeability, and vice versa.",
                        "Any suitable gas diffusion layer material may be used in the practice of the present invention. Typically the gas diffusion layer is comprised of sheet or roll good material comprising carbon fibers. Typically, the gas diffusion layer is a carbon fiber construction selected from woven and non-woven carbon fiber constructions. Carbon fiber constructions which may be useful in the practice of the present invention may include: Toray\u2122 Carbon Paper, SpectraCarb\u2122 Carbon Paper, Zoltek\u2122 Carbon Cloth, AvCarb\u2122 P50 carbon fiber paper, and the like. The gas diffusion layer may be provided in sheets, as a roll good, or in any suitable form.",
                        "As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the gas diffusion layer 104 has a first major surface 140 and an opposite second major surface 150. The thickness of the gas diffusion layer is typically between about 10 and 500 microns, more preferably between about 30 and 300 microns (e.g., about 30, 50, 70, 100, 130, 150, 200, 250, or 300 microns).",
                        "In order to prevent the gas diffusion layer from becoming flooded with liquid water in the present invention, the gas diffusion layer material is made more hydrophobic by direct fluorination. However, it has been shown that fluorination increases the ohmic resistance of carbon materials, mainly due to the C\u2014F product on the surface (see Table 1). Thus, if the surface of the gas diffusion layer is in contact with other components like the catalyst layers and flow distributor plates, the resistive C\u2014F surface may lead to higher ohmic resistance in the cell and poorer performance.",
                        "In the present invention, the conductivity of the gas diffusion layer 104 is maintained because at least one of the first major surface 140 and the second major surface 150 is substantially free of fluorination. As used therein, the term \u201csubstantially free\u201d means that at least 50 percent of the surface area of the major surfaces (e.g., the surface 140 designed to be in contact with the catalyst layer) is not fluorinated. For example, at least about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, or 100% of the surface area of the major surface (e.g., the surface 140 that is designed to be in contact with the catalyst layer) is not fluorinated. Most preferably, both major surfaces 140, 150 of the gas diffusion layer 104 are substantially free of fluorination. The degree to which the major surfaces 140, 150 of the gas diffusion layer 104 are fluorinated may be the same or different.",
                        "In one aspect, the first and/or second major surfaces 140, 150 of the gas diffusion layer 104 are protected from direct fluorination during the fluorination process. The surfaces may be protected by contacting the surface with a protective layer during the fluorination process. In an exemplary aspect, the first and second major surfaces 140, 150 are protected by sandwiching the gas diffusion layer 104 between two protective layers 160, 170 as generally shown in FIG. 2 (left panel). In a preferred aspect, the protective layers are comprised of the same material used to form the gas diffusion layer 104. That is, the gas diffusion layer 104 is sandwiched between two protective porous carbon substrates 160, 170. In one aspect, the contact involves a compressive force, although that is not required. The porous protective gas diffusion layers 160, 170 on the top and bottom of the gas diffusion layer 104 permit the fluorine gas to penetrate and react with the gas diffusion layer 104 in the middle while protecting its outside major surfaces 140, 150. The fluorination may be performed in either a batch or continuous process. In a continuous process, the protective layers 160, 170 continuously contact the gas diffusion layer 104, and may be under compression.",
                        "In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a one-layer method for forming the gas diffusion layer. In this method, the gas diffusion layer 104 is directly fluorinated by exposure to fluorine gas, as generally shown in FIG. 2 (right panel). In general, the gas diffusion layer 104 is typically comprised of carbon fibers having tens of thousands of carbon atomic layers (i.e., typically micron-sized carbon fibers). Direct fluorination results in a C\u2014F covalent bond at the top atomic layer of the carbon atoms (i.e., the internal carbons of the carbon fiber are not fluorinated). If this upper/top atomic C\u2014F layer is removed, the underlying carbon substrate of the carbon fibers may be exposed. Thus, in this embodiment, the fluorinated outside major surfaces 140, 150 of the gas diffusion layer 104 are removed by a physical or chemical method, for example by sanding, physical plasma etching, or chemical reactive ion etching. Physical etching is typically done using an argon plasma. The energetic argon atoms in the plasma remove both the fluorine and carbon atoms on the upper/top atomic C\u2014F layer. The extent of the removal will depend upon the power level and the duration of the etching, and can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. Likewise, chemical reaction ion etching uses plasma and reactive gases like SF6 which can etch the upper/top atomic C\u2014F layer by both physical etching and by reacting with the surface to from a gaseous product. Thus, in one aspect, the upper/top C\u2014F layer is removed by an etching method selected from the group consisting of ion etching, ion beam etching, reactive ion etching, reactive ion beam etching, and combinations thereof. The plasma excitation can for example be performed by supplying microwave electric power, radio frequency electric power, or DC electric power.",
                        "The one-layer approach may be used as a batch or continuous process in which there can be two stages. In the first stage, the porous gas diffusion materials 104 can be fed continuously from a roll into a direct fluorinating reactor chamber. After the material comes out of the first stage, it can be fed continuously into the second stage in which the C\u2014F layers of the outer major surfaces 140, 150 can be removed. This alternative method may be more economical than the sandwich approach, which is generally more suitable for batch processes."

While this test cannot measure the hydrophobicity or contact angle inside the sample, the method is suitable because since all exposed carbon surface reacts with fluorine the inner exposed carbon surface should have the same property as the exposed outer surface.",

The results show that direct fluorination does not change the physical dimensions or shape of the materials. Since the amount of fluorine is quite small, one fluorine atom per carbon on the surface of the carbon fibers which is a tiny fraction of the total carbon in the material, it is not detectable by EDX. However, as shown in the Table 3 below, when the material is crushed to expose the surface inside the substrate the amount of fluorine in the sample is detectable.

With XPS, it is possible to identify the nature and the amount of fluorine containing groups attached to the surface of the carbon substrates (carbon fibers in GDL) because of the fluorination processes. The fluorine content in the GDL can be calculated based on the difference in weight before and after fluorination. However, this fluorine content is actually the ratio of fluorine to total carbon, which may depart significantly from the surface composite. The XPS result will directly reveal the surface elemental and chemical information of the coating. The fluorine to carbon ratios could be obtained by integrating the intensities of XPS C 1 s and F 1 s features. XPS spectra for a carbon sample before and after treatment by direct fluorination shown in FIG. 8 clearly illustrate the formation of the CF species on the carbon surface. The F/C ratio could be determined by the areas covered by F 1 s and C 1 s peaks. Assuming the fluorine species are chemically bonded to carbon, this will change the energy of the core electrons of the bonded carbon, resulting in a chemical shift. For example, chemical shifts of 4.7, 6.7, and 9.0 eV of C1s peak (about 285 eV) can be attributed to the surface group of CF, CF2, and CF3, respectively. With the current state of the art XPS system, an energy resolution of 0.5 eV can be achieved. High resolution XPS spectra will be collected to investigate the chemical nature of carbon fluorine bond.",

A Raman spectrum can also be used to identify the surface functional groups of the carbon materials. Typically, two classical bands, D mode (disorder) and G mode (graphite), result from defects on the carbon and the carbon-carbon stretching mode. The ratio (\u201cR\u201d) of the intensities of the D band to that of the G band represents the structure and the degree of disorder of the carbon surface. For fluorinated carbon materials, R increases with the fluorination temperature, which directly correlates with the extent of fluorine compound formation on the carbon surface. For the un-treated carbon nano fibers (\u201cCNFs\u201d), the defects come mainly from the disordered edges of the nanotubes, which have a very small R ratio (small ID/IG).",

Since the capillary pressure curve is probably the most important property of the GDM, this property will be selected as the indicator of the GDM durability. In a PEM fuel cell, the three parameters that have the greatest impacts on the durability of a GDM are temperature, water, and acidity (due to the leaching of the ionic groups from the membrane). To simulate the conditions in a PEM fuel cell and to shorten the testing time, the GDM will be soaked in a 1 M sulfuric acid solution at 80\u00b0 C.

The microporous layer is in contact with the catalyst layer in order to keep the CL/GDL interface free of liquid water and/or create a high capillary pressure boundary to drive liquid water back to the anode. As with the macroporous layer, the microporous layer is conventionally made wet-proof by adding PTFE. However, the microporous is conventionally made differently from the macroporous layer. While the macroporous layer is made of carbon fibers, which is later made wet-proof by coating the carbon fibers with PTFE, the microporous layer is made of carbon powder mixed with PTFE. The PTFE phase in the micro-porous layer is used both as a binder and as a wet-proofing material. In this approach, complete carbon surface coverage with PTFE is not possible because it will render this layer non-electrically conductive.",

More specifically, the gas diffusion layer comprised an untreated macroporous carbon substrate adjacent a microporous carbon substrate comprised of carbon powder mixed with PTFE commercially available from SGL Carbon (Product No. SGL 35AC). The mean pore size for the macroporous layer was about 15 to 30 microns, and the mean pore size for the microporous layer was about 1-3 microns. The gas diffusion bilayer was directly fluorinated at about 350 to 450\u00b0 C. using the methods discussed herein. The F2-treated bilayer was then placed on a high grade sandpaper (grade 1500) and lightly rotated a few times over the sandpaper. This sanding step was repeated for the other side of the gas diffusion bilayer. The major surfaces were then wiped with isopropanol to clean the surfaces. The resulting gas diffusion layer was thus a bilayer having a first major surface comprised of the microporous carbon substrate and a second major surface comprised of the macroporous carbon substrate. The gas diffusion layer was directly fluorinated in the interior and was substantially free of fluorination on the first major surfaces and second major surfaces.",
