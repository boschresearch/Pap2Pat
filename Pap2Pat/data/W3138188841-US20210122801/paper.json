    "abstract": "Excess circulating human growth hormone (hGH) in vivo is linked to metabolic and growth disorders such as cancer, diabetes, and acromegaly. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing antagonists of hGH action. Here, we present the design, synthesis, and characterization of a 16-residue peptide (site 1-binding helix [S1H]) that inhibits hGH-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation in cultured cells. S1H was designed as a direct sequence mimetic of the site 1 mini-helix (residues 36-51) of wild-type hGH and acts by inhibiting the interaction of hGH with the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR). In vitro studies indicated that S1H is stable in human serum and can adopt an \u03b1-helix in solution. Our results also show that S1H mitigates phosphorylation of STAT5 in cells co-treated with hGH, reducing intracellular STAT5 phosphorylation levels to those observed in untreated controls. Furthermore, S1H was found to attenuate the activity of the hGHR and the human prolactin receptor, suggesting that this peptide acts as an antagonist of both lactogenic and somatotrophic hGH actions. Finally, we used alanine scanning to determine how discrete amino acids within the S1H sequence contribute to its structural organization and biological activity. We observed a strong correlation between helical propensity and inhibitory effect, indicating that S1H-mediated antagonism of the hGHR is largely dependent on the ability for S1H to adopt an \u03b1-helix. Taken together, these results show that S1H not only acts as a novel peptide-based antagonist of the hGHR but can also be applied as a chemical tool to study the molecular nature of hGH-hGHR interactions.",

                        "Efforts to develop a novel peptide-based antagonist of the hGHR were initiated with a comprehensive analysis of the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction (Fig.\u00a01A). The three-dimensional structure of the hGH\u2013hGHR complex (79) shows that hGH binds two separate hGHR subunits through two distal sites on hGH (site 1 and site 2). Dynamic modeling simulations of the hGH\u2013hGHR binding event have indicated that hGH first makes contact with one hGHR monomer via site 1 before binding to the second hGHR monomer via site 2 (80). To reduce the influence of induced or additive binding effects resulting from the preassociation of native hGH to the hGHR, we focused our attention on designing a peptide-based antagonist that would target the incipient (site 1) interaction. At this point, several regions within the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction interface were considered for targeted inhibition. We initially noticed that hGH makes contact with the hGHR on the N-terminal side of the second mini-helix (residues 64\u201369) located within the \u201clarge loop\u201d of hGH. However, this region of hGH is inherently unstructured and was not expected to provide a large enough surface area for effective inhibition. We also noted that helix 4 (residues 168\u2013179) of hGH makes direct contact with the first hGHR monomer at a site that is proximal to the hGHR dimerization interface. Targeting this site for inhibition was also deemed suboptimal because the inhibitor peptide would have to compete sterically with amino acid residues of the hGHR that are involved in receptor dimerization. Following this initial assessment, we speculated that the first mini-helix of the hGH \u201clarge loop\u201d (residues 38\u201347) binds the hGHR at a site with high potential for peptide-based inhibition (Fig.\u00a01B). Our hypothesis was based on the following considerations: (1) this specific interaction occurs within site 1 of hGH; (2) the binding site is distal from the hGHR dimerization interface; (3) the interaction is comprised of a relatively large binding surface; and (4) the hGHR-binding domain of hGH is helical at this site. We next moved to design a peptide that would act as a direct sequence mimetic of the hGH mini-helix (residues 38\u201347) located within the \u201clarge loop\u201d between helices I and II. The S1H peptide corresponds to residues 36 to 51 of full-length hGH and includes the entire helical recognition motif flanked on each side by a short sequence of amino acids (YIPKEQKYSFLQNPQT). These flanking residues were included to enhance specific recognition between the peptide substrate and its target protein (81). Interestingly, amino acid sequence alignments of GHs from different vertebrates revealed multiple variations in this region (Fig.\u00a01C). According to these sequences, K39, E40, K42, F45, L46, and P49 residues are unique to hGH, whereas Q41, Y43, S44, Q47, N48, and Q50 are well-conserved among various species. In addition, the 20 kDa hGH isoform (vide supra) differs from the 22 kDa WT hGH because of a splice variation that deletes 15 amino acids between residues 32 to 46 (50). Notably, this region overlaps significantly with site 1 of hGH and the sequence of the S1H peptide. The 20 kDa hGH isoform has been reported to have a 10-fold lower binding affinity for the hGHR compared with the 22 kDa hGH (82), which hints strongly at the presumed ability for S1H peptides to antagonize the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction.Figure\u00a01Rational design of the S1H peptide.A, three-dimensional crystal structure of hGH bound to homodimeric hGHR. hGH (salmon) is shown as a ribbon diagram bound to the hGHR (gray); the site 1 mini-helix of hGH is colored purple.

                        "As mentioned above, the S1H peptide was designed to mimic a helical region of hGH that interacts with the hGHR over a modestly large surface area. According to the hGH\u2013hGHR co-crystal structure, this segment contains at least five residues (K39, K42 Y43, L46, and Q47) that make putative contacts with the surface of the receptor (Fig.\u00a02A). At this site, the binding between hGH and the hGHR is believed to be driven by a combination of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic interactions (Fig.\u00a0S1). Moreover, because this region of hGH is helical when bound to the hGHR, we speculated that S1H would need to possess inherent helical propensity to elicit favorable interactions with the receptor. Following synthesis and characterization of the S1H peptide (see Materials and Methods, Fig.\u00a0S2), we evaluated the solution-phase structure of S1H using wavelength-dependent circular dichroism (10.13039/100011639CD) spectropolarimetry (Fig.\u00a02B). Far-UV CD measurements were collected from S1H peptide samples (20\u00a0\u03bcM) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 25 \u00b0C and plotted as mean residue ellipticity versus wavelength (195\u00a0nm to 255\u00a0nm). S1H was found to contain a slight shoulder around 215\u00a0nm and a minimum at 198\u00a0nm in PBS, indicating that this peptide is inherently unstructured under these conditions. It is worth noting that unless endowed with some structure-inducing linkage or sidechain complex, peptide oligomers comprised of less than 20 amino acids often adopt random coils in solution (83, 84). We next evaluated the helical propensity of S1H by dissolving the peptide (20\u00a0\u03bcM) in PBS supplemented with 30% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and assessing its structure using wavelength-dependent CD spectropolarimetry as described above. TFE is a structure-inducing co-solvent that can be used to evaluate the propensity of short peptide oligomers to fold in solution (85). Results from these experiments showed that TFE had a dramatic effect on the solution-phase structure of the S1H peptide (Fig.\u00a02B). Here, the CD spectrum of S1H showed a shoulder at 225\u00a0nm, a minimum at 210\u00a0nm and a maximum at 198\u00a0nm. This specific CD signature indicates that S1H undergoes a transition from a random coil to a predominantly folded structure following the addition of TFE. Helical populations for each sample were estimated using the mean residue ellipticity at 222\u00a0nm, while taking into account the peptide length (see Materials and Methods) (86). From these calculations, it was determined that S1H dissolved in PBS alone was 1.1% helical, whereas S1H incubated in PBS supplemented with TFE showed 48.2% helicity. These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of S1H peptide is capable of adopting a helical fold in the presence of structure-inducing co-solvents. Perhaps more importantly, however, the inherent helical propensity of S1H suggests that this peptide has the ability to fold into a structural configuration that can mimic the site 1 mini-helix of hGH when targeting the hGHR.Figure\u00a02Structural characterization of S1H peptide.A, ribbon diagram of S1H peptide helix.

                        "Peptide and protein hormones released into the bloodstream often have short half-lives due in part to relatively high concentrations of proteases in the serum (87, 88). Indeed, proteolytic susceptibility is often a major limitation that hinders the therapeutic efficacy of peptide- and protein-based drugs (89). We were therefore interested in testing the stability of S1H in a serum-rich microenvironment. To assess this, we incubated S1H peptides in RPMI media supplemented with 25% (v/v) human AB serum for up to 48\u00a0h at 37 \u00b0C and quantified the fraction of intact peptide using reversed-phase HPLC (Figure\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a0S3). We observed that the S1H peptide was not significantly degraded under these conditions, with >89% of the peptide remaining intact after 48\u00a0h incubation. This indicates that the S1H peptide is inherently stable in a serum-rich microenvironment and should remain intact as it is delivered to cultured cells (vide infra). As a positive control for degradation of the peptide, we incubated S1H with trypsin at 37 \u00b0C and similarly monitored its degradation by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig.\u00a0S4A). Under these conditions, it was shown that the S1H peptide was rapidly degraded to three major products (likely because of to the presence of two lysines within the S1H sequence), with no intact peptide detected after 15\u00a0min incubation. To gain further insight into how the stability of S1H compares to that of hGH and pegvisomant, we tested the stability of the recombinant proteins under similar conditions. For these experiments, hGH and pegvisomant were dissolved in RPMI media supplemented with 25% (v/v) human serum and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for up to 48\u00a0h. Following incubation, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the extent of degradation was assessed by Western blotting (Figure\u00a03, Fig.\u00a0S5). Interestingly, it was determined that hGH was more stable than either S1H or pegvisomant under these conditions, with >92% of the protein remaining intact following 48\u00a0h incubation. On the other hand, pegvisomant was the least stable in human serum, with only 76% of the protein remaining after 48\u00a0h. As positive controls for protein degradation, hGH and pegvisomant were incubated with trypsin at 37 \u00b0C for up to 8\u00a0h and monitored by HPLC and Western blotting (Figs.\u00a0S4, B and C, and S5). Here, it was observed that hGH was fully degraded after 8\u00a0h incubation, whereas pegvisomant only took 4\u00a0h to be digested under similar conditions. This result was somewhat surprising, as pegvisomant contains multiple PEGylations that are believed to increase its half-life in\u00a0vivo compared with hGH (90). It could be speculated that the higher degree of degradation seen with pegvisomant is attributed to the loss of PEG conjugates during the incubation or comparatively enhanced binding to serum proteins (91, 92).Figure\u00a03Quantification of peptide and protein stability (reported as fraction of intact molecule) following incubation in 25% (v/v) human AB serum for 0 to 48\u00a0h.

                        "A major downstream effect of hGH-mediated activation of the hGHR is the phosphorylation of intracellular transcription factors, including STAT5A and STAT5B (93, 94). In this signaling cascade, binding of hGH to hGHR leads to transactivation of hGHR-associated JAK2, which phosphorylates the intracellular domain of hGHR at five tyrosine residues: Y332, Y487, Y534, Y566, and Y627 (95). STAT5 then docks via its SH2 domains to the phosphorylated hGHR and is subsequently phosphorylated by JAK2 (10, 11). The phosphorylation of STAT5 (pSTAT5) can be observed just minutes after adding hGH to cultured cells, making intracellular pSTAT5 quantitation a convenient metric of hGHR activation. Inhibitors of hGHR action, such as pegvisomant and FGF21, have been shown to block hGH-mediated pSTAT5 in cell lines that express high levels of hGHR (96). Here, we used intracellular pSTAT5 levels to quantify S1H-mediated antagonism of the hGHR in cultured human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28 and MALME-3M), human lymphoblasts (IM9), and mouse (L) fibroblasts. The human cells used in these studies were previously reported to express high levels of endogenous hGHR (48, 97), whereas the mouse L fibroblasts express high levels of mouse GHR (98). To determine whether S1H could inhibit hGH-mediated pSTAT5, we co-treated SK-MEL-28 cells, MALME-3M cells, IM9 cells, and mouse L fibroblasts with S1H and hGH and evaluated pSTAT5 levels via Western blotting (Fig.\u00a04). As expected, the addition of 2.5\u00a0nM (50\u00a0ng/ml) hGH showed significant upregulation of pSTAT5 within 20\u00a0min across all cell lines tested. It was also observed that cells co-treated with S1H and hGH displayed significantly lower levels of pSTAT5 compared with cells treated with hGH alone. This inhibitory effect was dose dependent, with hGH-mediated pSTAT5 levels being suppressed by 46% and 67%, respectively, in SK-MEL-28 cells treated with 100\u00a0nM or 200\u00a0nM\u00a0S1H (Fig.\u00a04, A and E). Similar treatments in MALME-3M cells indicated that S1H suppresses pSTAT5 levels by 56% at concentrations of 200\u00a0nM in this cell line (Fig.\u00a04, B and E). Significant degrees of hGHR antagonism were also observed in IM9 and L (mouse fibroblast) cells, with S1H suppressing hGH-mediated pSTAT5 by 67% and 36%, respectively, at 200\u00a0nM (Fig.\u00a04, C\u2013E). To determine whether S1H can act as a hGHR agonist, we treated SK-MEL-28, MALME-3M, and IM9 cells with 25\u00a0nM or 100\u00a0nM\u00a0S1H for 20\u00a0min and quantified intracellular pSTAT5 levels by Western blot (Fig.\u00a0S6). It was observed here that S1H did not increase pSTAT5 concentrations above background (untreated) levels in any cell line tested. Taken together, these results indicate that S1H is able to inhibit the hGH-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 in cultured cells by acting as an antagonist of the hGHR.Figure\u00a04S1H inhibits hGH-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation in cultured cells. For these experiments, cells were treated with S1H peptide (0\u2013200\u00a0nM) in the presence of 2.5\u00a0nM hGH for 20\u00a0min.

                        "Growth hormone, prolactin (PRL), and placental lactogen are all members of the class-I cytokine superfamily. Incidentally, all three cytokines are capable of binding and activating the human prolactin receptor (hPRLR), which leads to phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 (99). Owing to this broad-spectrum activation profile, the mechanistic design of hGHR and hPRLR antagonists often overlap (100). We were therefore interested in determining whether the S1H peptide could interfere with hGH-induced activation of the hPRLR. To answer this question, we treated MALME-3M (human melanoma) and T84 (human colon cancer) cells with either 2.5\u00a0nM hGH or hPRL in the absence or presence of S1H and quantified the level of pSTAT5 by Western blotting (Fig.\u00a05). These cell lines were selected for this study based on the following criteria: MALME-3M cells express high levels of hGHR relative to hPRLR (>100:1), whereas T84 cells express high levels of hPRLR relative to hGHR (>1300:1) (101). This allowed us to study whether S1H was able to selectively attenuate hPRLR activation without significant influence of hGHR-mediated signaling. Here, we observed that S1H could suppress hGH-induced pSTAT5 in MALME-3M cells in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated greater efficacy for hGHR antagonism than pegvisomant. More specifically, we found that 50\u00a0nM S1H treatments inhibited pSTAT5 production by 40% compared with cells treated with hGH alone, whereas treatment with 50\u00a0nM pegvisomant inhibited STAT5 inhibition by 33% under the same conditions (Fig.\u00a05, A and E). Both S1H and pegvisomant suppressed the hGH-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 by similar amounts (27%) at 50\u00a0nM in T84 cells (Fig.\u00a05, B and E). We also observed a clear dose-dependence in S1H-mediated inhibition of pSTAT5 in T84 cells that had been co-treated with hGH. Finally, we observed that unlike pegvisomant, S1H inhibited hPRL-induced pSTAT5 by 49% in MALME-3M cells and 13% in T84 cells (Fig.\u00a05, C\u2013E). This result strongly suggests that the S1H peptide can impede the association of hPRL with hPRLR and mitigate downstream signaling cascades that are initiated by this interaction. Furthermore, these findings indicate that despite being designed specifically as an antagonist of the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction, the S1H peptide may have broader inhibitory effects, namely, antagonizing the PRL/PLRR interaction.Figure\u00a05S1H attenuates hGHR and hPRLR activation in cultured cells. For these experiments, cells were treated with either hGH or hPRL for 20\u00a0min in the presence or absence of pegvisomant or S1H.

                        "In addition to their obvious use as agonist or antagonists of therapeutically relevant molecular interactions, peptides can also be utilized as tools to study the physical nature of PPIs (102, 103). Indeed, a major advantage of using peptides for studying PPIs is that they provide a sequence-specific scaffold that can be modified with high precision. We therefore surmised that sequence variants of S1H could be used to determine which amino acid residues facilitate structural organization and biological activity of the peptide. For these studies, we employed alanine scanning to develop a library of S1H sequence variants in which individual residues within the primary sequence were replaced with alanine (Table\u00a0S1). All S1H sequence variants used in this work were synthesized, purified, and characterized similarly to WT S1H as described in the Experimental procedures section. Following synthesis and purification, we evaluated the helical propensities of each variant using wavelength-dependent 10.13039/100011639CD spectropolarimetry (Fig.\u00a0S7). Here, it was demonstrated that select amino acids within the S1H peptide were critical for imparting helical propensity, whereas others had little influence over the ability for the peptide to fold. Interestingly, some variants displayed >10% helicity even in the absence of TFE, indicating that the original amino acid has structure-disrupting effects. Specifically, the K39A variant exhibited 23.4% helicity in the absence of TFE, suggesting that K39 is helix-disrupting (WT S1H was only 1.1% helical under similar conditions). Other residues that were found to be helix disrupters in the S1H sequence were Y43, S44, and F45. Each of these alanine substitutions resulted in peptides that had greater than 10% helical character in the absence of TFE (Table\u00a0S2). Residues that did not have a measurable impact on S1H helicity included E40, K42, and N48. As expected, all S1H sequence variants showed modest to strong increases in helicity when incubated with TFE, indicating that each construct was able to adopt a more organized fold in the presence of structure-inducing co-solvents regardless of amino acid substitution. However, peptide variants F45A and N48A each displayed minimal change in helicity following the addition of TFE, suggesting that these constructs resist folding into a more pronounced helix compared to S1H."

                        "Following the structural characterization of our S1H sequence variants, we tested the influence of singular alanine substitutions on S1H-mediated hGHR antagonism. For these experiments, we co-treated SK-MEL-28 cells with hGH and S1H variants and utilized ELISA to quantify changes in intracellular concentrations of pSTAT5 (Fig.\u00a06). Notably, each alanine variant was able to lower intracellular hGH-mediated pSTAT5 to concentrations below that of cells treated with hGH alone, indicating that all constructs retained some antagonist activity. However, none of the sequence variants were able to reach the level of inhibition observed with WT S1H under these conditions. Notably, we observed a broad range of efficacy among the variants, with certain alanine substitutions eliciting significantly weaker antagonist effects than others. For example, S1H variants E40A, Q41A, K42A, F45A, and Q47A all displayed reduced inhibitory effects compared with WT S1H, indicating that these residues are important for S1H-mediated hGHR antagonism (Fig.\u00a06, Table\u00a0S2). On the other hand, the K39A, Y43A, S44A, L46A, and N48A variants all showed antagonist activity that was comparable to WT S1H, suggesting that alanine substitutions at these positions do not affect the ability of the S1H peptide to inhibit hGH-mediated pSTAT5. We initially anticipated that substituting S1H residues that make direct contact with the hGHR (Figure\u00a02, Fig.\u00a0S1) would strongly reduce the inhibitory effects of S1H. It was therefore surprising that we observed no obvious correlation between amino acid position and antagonist activity. With the exception of K42A and Q47A, the antagonist activity of S1H variants containing an alanine substitution at a residue that makes direct contact with the hGHR was only minimally affected. In addition, we noticed that certain sequence variants containing alanine substitutions at residues that point away from the presumed S1H\u2013hGHR interface (such as E40A) lost almost all antagonist activity. This somewhat counterintuitive result prompted us to examine additional physicochemical properties that may be important for facilitating S1H-mediated hGHR antagonism. At this point, we noticed a strong correlation between peptide helicity and antagonist activity (Table\u00a0S2). Upon comparing these two parameters, it was observed that nearly all S1H variants having greater than 60% helicity in the presence of TFE showed significant antagonism of pSTAT5. On the other hand, peptides with less than 60% helicity had reduced antagonist effects. For example, the K39A variant showed 67.1% helicity and 88.5% inhibition, whereas the E40A construct displayed 28.6% helicity and 33.4% inhibition. Taken together, these results imply that helical propensity may be more important for affecting S1H-mediated hGHR antagonism than individual side chain contacts between the peptide and receptor, at least in the context of alanine substitutions. It should be noted that we did observe two exceptions to these findings with S1H variants Q47A and N48A. Under these conditions, the Q47A peptide showed only modest (30%) inhibition despite having enhanced helical propensity (86.3%). Alternatively, the N48A variant was able to reduce pSTAT5 levels to near background (89%) levels despite having diminished helical character (12.2%). These results suggest that Q47 is important for hGHR recognition by S1H but is not needed for structural organization and that N48 is important for imparting helicity to the S1H peptide but is not required for S1H-mediated hGHR antagonism.Figure\u00a06Quantification of intracellular pSTAT5 concentrations in SK-MEL-28 cells by ELISA following co-treatment with human growth hormone (hGH) and various inhibitors.

                "The ability to target PPIs with high precision is arguably one of the most pressing challenges facing modern medicinal chemistry. Nevertheless, the development of such molecules affords tremendous opportunities for advancing clinical research. For example, synthetic molecules that target large, shallow protein interaction surfaces not only hold considerable promise as potential therapeutics but may also be developed as chemical tools that can provide insight into the nature of biomolecular interactions. These constructs can also act as chemical genetic agents (104) that serve to expand the pool of \u201cdruggable\u201d proteins. In this report, we developed a peptide-based hGHR antagonist (S1H) by focusing on a short, helical region of hGH that makes contact with one monomeric subunit of the hGHR homodimer. Herein, we demonstrated that the S1H peptide can fold into an \u03b1-helix in the presence of structure inducing co-solvents and also showed that it is highly stable in human serum for up to 48\u00a0h. These findings are significant as they indicate that S1H peptides have the propensity to fold into structures that mimic the site 1 mini-helix (residues 38\u201347) of hGH and will remain intact as they are delivered to cells in culture. Results from our stability studies also showed that the S1H peptide is more stable in human serum than pegvisomant, an FDA-approved hGHR antagonist used in the treatment of acromegaly. We attribute this somewhat surprising finding to pegvisomant possibly losing PEGylations or binding to serum proteins (91, 92) during the incubation period.",
                "As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that S1H attenuates hGH-induced pSTAT5 in a dose-dependent manner in cultured cells co-treated with S1H and hGH. Owing to its structural similarity to the site 1 mini-helix contained within the \u201clarge loop\u201d of hGH, it is likely that S1H antagonizes the hGHR by directly interfering with the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction through site 1. To the best of our knowledge, this region of the hGHR has not yet been targeted by small molecules or other peptide-based antagonists. Therefore, the results outlined in this study serve to expand the number of potentially \u201cdruggable\u201d sites on the hGHR. We also determined that S1H can attenuate the activation of hPRLR by showing that S1H inhibits the hPRLR-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 in cultured cells. It has been reported previously that several amino acids of the hGH site 1 mini-helix are required for favorable hGH\u2013hPRLR interactions (105). Moreover, significant structural deviations arise in this region when the hGH is bound to either hGHR or hPRLR (54, 106). In the context of our studies, it can be postulated that the S1H peptide interferes with ligand binding to the hPRLR, and that S1H is an effective inhibitor of lactogenic and somatotropic actions of hGH. While this conclusion obviously requires further validation, this intriguing finding suggests that S1H may be useful for inhibiting the many physiological actions of hGH in\u00a0vivo. Indeed, this effect will become especially relevant when developing S1H as a potential therapeutic that can be used to treat hGH- or hPRL-mediated disease, including certain type of cancers.",
                "In addition to its biological effects, the S1H peptide proved to be a useful chemical tool to study the molecular nature of the hGH\u2013hGHR interaction. Here, we were able to use alanine scanning to identify which specific residues within the S1H sequence are important for helical propensity and biological activity. Surprisingly, substituting alanine for residues that participate in the presumed S1H\u2013hGHR interface did not always translate to reduced antagonist activity. This finding suggests that at least in the context of alanine substitutions, many of the individual residues within the site 1 mini-helix of hGH are not explicitly required for favorable hGH\u2013hGHR interactions. We did, however, observe a strong correlation between biological activity and helical propensity of our S1H sequence variants, which indicates that structural organization of the hGH site 1 mini-helix is important when affecting hGH binding to the hGHR. Taken together, these findings seem to suggest that the ability to form a helix is more important than amino acid sequence when modulating interactions between the hGH site 1 mini-helix and the hGHR.",
                "Finally, it has not escaped our notice that there exists a high degree of sequence overlap between the S1H peptide and the deleted 15-residues of the 20-kDa hGH isoform. It has been shown previously that both the 22 kDa and 20 kDa hGH isoforms bind and activate the hGHR with similar efficiency (107). However, the 20 kDa hGH variant demonstrates a 10-fold weaker complex with hGHR at the site 1-binding interface compared with the 22 kDa hGH isoform. This occurs despite the 20 kDa version having a stronger (10-fold) affinity for binding site 2 compared with the 22 kDa version (82). In addition, the 20 kDa hGH isoform was found to form a 1:2 complex with the hGHR with a binding affinity that is similar to the 22 kDa hGH, but the 20 kDa hGH had markedly lower affinity to the hGHR when forming a 1:1 complex. This lower binding affinity was attributed to the deletion of the 15 amino acids, which effectively removes a major portion of the site 1 interaction domain (108). There is also considerable variation among such hGH isoforms when binding and activating the hPRLR (51). For example, the 20 kDa hGH isoform shows weaker (10-fold) activity when activating the PRLR compared with the 22 kDa isoform, indicating that residues 36 to 51 are important for hGH-mediated cross-activation of human PRLR. This observation, coupled with the results presented herein, has allowed us to speculate that S1H can antagonize hGH-mediated PRLR activation. To be sure, it remains to be seen whether S1H will inhibit the binding of the 20 kDa hGH to the hGHR with the same efficacy as it does the 22 kDa hGH. However, we anticipate that S1H binds the hGHR at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and will result in the competitive inhibition of both hGH isoforms."

                        "Cytosolic fractions from treated cells were thawed on ice, and 80\u00a0\u03bcg protein was loaded onto polyacrylamide gels for separation by SDS-PAGE. All SDS-PAGE gels were resolved at 120\u00a0V for 1.5\u00a0h at 20 \u00b0C. Following separation, the proteins were transferred to activated polyvinylidine difluoride membranes using a wet-transfer method at 20\u00a0V for 16\u00a0h at 4 \u00b0C. The membrane was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 1\u00d7 TBS-T (Tris buffered saline, 0.1% Triton-X100, pH 7.2) for 2\u00a0h at 25 \u00b0C and incubated with primary antibody at specified dilutions for 16\u00a0h at 4 \u00b0C. Following addition of primary antibody, the membrane was washed and subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies at the indicated dilutions for 2\u00a0h at 25 \u00b0C. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T and treated with West Femto Chemiluminescence detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chemiluminescence signals were detected using a GelDoc (BioRad) fluorescence imager. Densitometry analyses of the blots was performed using ImageJ Software (111) by measuring the integrated band density and normalizing against band intensity of the loading control (\u03b2-actin) in the same lane. The integrated densities of pSTAT5 bands from cells after different treatments were then normalized to integrated densities of pSTAT5 bands from cells treated with hGH alone to obtain an induction ratio. Percent inhibition was then measured by subtracting the pSTAT5 band intensity in each lane from the pSTAT5 band intensity of hGH-treated samples. A list of antibodies, commercial sources, and dilution ratios is provided in Table\u00a0S3."

Briefly, 50\u00a0\u03bcl of protein sample (1\u00a0mg/ml) were added to wells containing 50\u00a0\u03bcl antibody cocktail in a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 2\u00a0h with shaking (300\u00a0rpm). Following incubation, the wells were washed, and the bound antibodies were detected by adding detection regent and incubating the plate for 1\u00a0h at room temperature with shaking (300\u00a0rpm). Following incubation, stop reagent was added, and the absorbance was read at 450\u00a0nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, model M2). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Percent pSTAT5 inhibition was calculated from background-subtracted pSTAT5 levels using Equation\u00a02:\\(\\%\\text{inhibition} = 100\\  \\times \\ {\\left( {{\\text{pSTAT}5}_{\\text{hGH}} - {\\text{pSTAT}5}_{\\text{PI}}} \\right)/{\\text{pSTAT}5}_{\\text{hGH}}}\\) where pSTAT5hGH is the fold-induction of pSTAT5 upon treatment with hGH alone and pSTAT5PI is the fold-induction of pSTAT5 upon co-treatment with hGH and peptide inhibitor."
