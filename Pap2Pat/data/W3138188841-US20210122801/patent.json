                        "Human growth hormone (hGH) is a 191-amino acid peptide that serves as an important endocrine mediator by controlling many physiological actions in the body including cell growth, reproduction and regeneration. HGH contains four main helices (A-D) that are required for its functional interaction with the hGH receptor (hGHR). Excess hGH activity can result in the onset of acromegaly, a syndrome characterized by uncontrolled bone and organ growth. If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to thickening of bones and enlarged organs. Also, high levels of hGH have been implicated in several types of in cancer. Consequently, there is great interest in the development of molecules that can selectively inhibit hGH action.",
                        "Synthetic peptides offer a viable alternative to small molecules and large proteins to target therapeutically relevant protein-protein interactions. Indeed, peptide-based drugs occupy a unique \u201cmiddle space\u201d that facilitates their development as potential therapeutics. For example, peptides under 50 amino acids in length are easily synthesized and can be generated through chemical synthesis procedures in the laboratory. Furthermore, peptides can be engineered to mimic protein interaction domains that fold into stable three-dimensional structures, thus providing a scaffold from which to design potential inhibitors. Because of these unique properties, peptide-based molecules can, in theory, be developed to target nearly any biomolecular interaction.",

Higher levels of sequence identity, e.g., 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% or more can also be used to establish homology.

Also contemplated are several types of compositions which are polypeptide based including variants and derivatives. These include substitutional, insertional, deletion and covalent variants and derivatives.

For example, sequence tags or amino acids, such as one or more lysines, can be added to the peptide sequences of the invention (e.g., at the N-terminal or C-terminal ends). Sequence tags can be used for peptide purification or localization. Lysines can be used to increase peptide solubility or to allow for biotinylation. Alternatively, amino acid residues located at the carboxy and amino terminal regions of the amino acid sequence of a peptide or protein may optionally be deleted providing for truncated sequences. Certain amino acids (e.g., C-terminal or N-terminal residues) may alternatively be deleted depending on the use of the sequence, as for example, expression of the sequence as part of a larger sequence which is soluble, or linked to a solid support.",

All reactions were performed on a 25 \u03bcmol scale in fritted glass reaction vessels to facilitate removal of reactants and starting materials. Amino acids and Fmoc deprotection were performed a microwave-accelerated reaction system (CEM, Matthews, N.C.) using software programs written in-house. Multiple rounds of washing using fresh NMP were performed between each coupling and deprotection reaction outlined herein. Amide bond formations were achieved by treating the deprotected resin with 5 equivalents (eq) of Fmoc-protected amino acid, 5 eq PyClock and 10 eq of DIEA in NMP. All equivalents are based on resin loading level. N-terminal Fmoc groups were removed by treating the peptide-resin with 25% (v/v) piperidine containing 0.1 M HOBt to minimize aspartimide formation. Iterative cycles of amino acid coupling and deprotections were repeated until peptides of desired sequence length were achieved. Following synthesis, the peptides were capped by treating the deprotected peptide-resin with 6% (v/v) acetic anhydride and 6% (v/v) 4-methylmorphine in NMP for 20 minutes at room temperature. This step was repeated and the capped peptide-resin was then washed thoroughly with NMP to remove any unreacted starting materials. Following washing, the resin was washed 5\u00d7 with NMP, 5\u00d7 with alternating volumes of NMP and dichloromethane and finally, 5\u00d7 with dichloromethane.

This reaction was then allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 38\u00b0 C. in the CEM microwave reactor. Following completion of the cleavage cycle, the peptides were precipitated in cold diethyl ether, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in an appropriate volume of aqueous ACN.

Peptides were eluted over 30 minutes with a linear gradient of 15-45% solvent B (0.1% TFA in ACN) over solvent A (0.1% TFA in water). Absorbance spectra were monitored at 214 and 280 nm to distinguish peptide products. The identities of the eluted peptides were evaluated by mass spectrometry.
