    "title": "Impact of labor characteristics on maternal and neonatal outcomes of labor: A machine-learning model",
    "date": "2022-08-22",
    "abstract": "Introduction Since Friedman\u2019s seminal publication on laboring women, numerous publications have sought to define normal labor progress. However, there is paucity of data on contemporary labor cervicometry incorporating both maternal and neonatal outcomes. The objective of this study is to establish intrapartum prediction models of unfavorable labor outcomes using machine-learning algorithms. Materials and methods Consortium on Safe Labor is a large database consisting of pregnancy and labor characteristics from 12 medical centers in the United States. Outcomes, including maternal and neonatal outcomes, were retrospectively collected. We defined primary outcome as the composite of following unfavorable outcomes: cesarean delivery in active labor, postpartum hemorrhage, intra-amniotic infection, shoulder dystocia, neonatal morbidity, and mortality. Clinical and obstetric parameters at admission and during labor progression were used to build machine-learning risk-prediction models based on the gradient boosting algorithm. Results Of 228,438 delivery episodes, 66,586 were eligible for this study. Mean maternal age was 26.95 \u00b1 6.48 years, mean parity was 0.92 \u00b1 1.23, and mean gestational age was 39.35 \u00b1 1.13 weeks. Unfavorable labor outcome was reported in 14,439 (21.68%) deliveries. Starting at a cervical dilation of 4 cm, the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of prediction models increased from 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.75\u20130.75) to 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.89\u20130.90) at a dilation of 10 cm. Baseline labor risk score was above 35% in patients with unfavorable outcomes compared to women with favorable outcomes, whose score was below 25%. Conclusion Labor risk score is a machine-learning\u2013based score that provides individualized and dynamic alternatives to conventional labor charts. It predicts composite of adverse birth, maternal, and neonatal outcomes as labor progresses. Therefore, it can be deployed in clinical practice to monitor labor progress in real time and support clinical decisions.",

                "Management recommendations of labor and delivery evolve constantly to accommodate evidence from literature. A major conundrum every obstetrician faces in managing women in labor is weighing maternal and neonatal risks of delayed intervention against risks of unindicated caesarean delivery (CD). Although the incidence of CD has substantially increased in the past 3 decades [1], there has been no discernible decline in maternal or neonatal adverse outcomes [2]. Labor dystocia represents the most common indication for primary CD, but diagnosis of labor dystocia lacks consistent evidence-based and globally acceptable definition. This may contribute, in part, to the increases in rates of CDs [3].",
                "One of the earliest studies to define normal labor progress was conducted in 1955 by Friedman [4]; based on observation of 500 women in labor, Friedman described the normal course of labor, known as the \u201cFriedman curve\u201d. The World Health Organization (WHO) relied on Freidman\u2019s data in its construction of a labor partogram for managing labor and labor dystocia, particularly in low-resource countries. A recent Cochrane review failed to demonstrate a significant difference in the rate of CD among women who were or were not managed by the WHO partogram [5]. In 2002, Zhang et al [6] studied 1,329 term nulliparous parturient and suggested that the Friedman curve may not be reflective of contemporary labor progress patterns. To verify their hypothesis, Zhang and colleagues conducted a multicenter study that prospectively collected clinical data, including pre-labor characteristics, intrapartum parameters, and maternal and neonatal outcomes of women who delivered at 1 of 12 studied clinical centers across the United States. This has become known as the Consortium on Safe Labor\u201d database [7]. This study created a new labor curve, which substantially modified the management of labor in the United States. However, the authors\u2019 analysis specifically excluded maternal and fetal outcomes data; thus, questions have been raised about the impact of adopting the Zhang labor curve on CD rates as well as maternal and fetal outcomes [8]. The objective of this study is to establish an individualized labor chart, through a series of intrapartum prediction models, using machine-learning algorithms that incorporate data on CD and obstetric outcomes. This dynamic tool may facilitate patient counselling and decision making and reduce the rate of CD, maternal, and neonatal complications."

A baseline model was created using variables identified at the time of patient admission (baseline predictors). A series of intrapartum prediction models were set up to incorporate dynamic variables determined by pelvic examination starting at a cervical dilation of 4 cm and other parameters, including use of oxytocin to augment labor and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. These variables included current cervical dilation, cervical effacement (categorized as 0%-30%, 40\u201350%, 60\u201370%, or 80% or more), head station (categorized as \u20133, \u20132, \u20131, 0, +1, or +2), time interval between current and previous examinations, change in cervical dilation between current and previous examinations, and dilation delta (defined as change in cervical dilation from previous examination divided by time interval between the 2 examinations). Intrapartum variables that could not be linked to a particular cervical dilation (e.g., meconium-stained amniotic fluid) were incorporated into the 10-cm prediction model.

In this study, the use of machine-learning methods capable of capturing representative features from changing labor characteristics is proposed.",
                                "Existing analytic methods for labor progression have been based on traditional statistical approaches, which, however, tend to make unrealistic assumptions regarding the functional form of the model and distribution of variables. These assumptions are often not applicable in complex clinical situations such as the dynamic labor process. As a result, the models may not fit the data well and may not be generalizable. Machine-learning methods, on the other hand, can estimate complex relationships between clinical measurements with reasonable accuracy, thus producing robust and consistent estimates without making a priori assumptions. These advanced data analytic techniques have been repeatedly shown to produce astonishing results in many applications in computer sciences, bioinformatics, health care, and elsewhere [10\u201313]. Thus, in this study, we propose applying machine-learning methods to collectively analyze the patterns of changes in usual prenatal and intrapartum variables based on the large DASH database. Specifically, we implemented an incremental extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm [14,15], where starting from the baseline model, the dynamic labor variables (at cervical dilation of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 cm) are incrementally used to extend the knowledge of an existing XGBoost model.",

An important enhancement is the implementation of the of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the ridge (Ridge) regularization methods [16], which are techniques designed to prevent overfitting."

Utilizing this database, this study applied machine-learning algorithms to generate a series of prediction models that incorporates both static and dynamic predictors, including patient baseline characteristics, most recent clinical assessment, and cumulative labor progress from admission. These models may provide an alternative to current practice, which endorses the use of labor charts. In contrast to labor charts, which set constant margins to safe labor course, machine-learning models promote individualization of clinical decisions using baseline and labor characteristics of each patient.",
                "For several decades, Friedman\u2019s sloping curve was cited as a reference of normal labor progress [18]. The terms \u201clatent labor\u201d and \u201cactive labor\u201d were introduced in the literature to discriminate initial slow interval (<3\u20133.5 cm) from subsequent accelerated labor course. In 1972, Philpott and Castle [19,20] proposed the use of \u201calert lines\u201d and \u201caction lines\u201d to facilitate management of labor through a prospective study of 624 Rhodesian African primigravida women and provided simplified directions to midwives in isolated areas. The WHO partogram was derived from these studies and has served as an important tool in managing labor, especially in low-resource countries.",
                "Although the WHO partogram has been adopted globally to standardize labor care and prevent prolonged labor, the routine use of the WHO partogram has been questioned; a Cochrane review of 3 clinical trials (1,813 patients) comparing partogram to no partogram use did not reveal differences in CD rates, duration of first stage of labor, or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes [8]. Despite its increasing use, the rate of CD has substantially increased in the past 3 decades, reaching 32% of total deliveries in the United States in 2017 [21]. This rising trend has not been associated with a concomitant decline in maternal or neonatal mortality [22]. Furthermore, the current rate of NICU admission among neonates delivered at term is notable, accounting for 4.6% of neonates delivered electively at 39 weeks of gestation [23]. The trend is increasing, and term neonates weighing at least 2,500 grams at birth may represent more than 50% of total NICU admissions [24].",
                "Zhang et al [7] hypothesized that current recommendations of management of labor were based on Friedman\u2019s study in the 1950s and may not reflect current populations. The new partogram differs from the WHO partogram; the 95th percentile line, which corresponds to the WHO action line, is an exponential-like stair line, which outlines a contemporary course of cervical dilation. Unlike the WHO partogram, which aims to prevent prolonged labor, Zhang et al proposed their partogram as a clinical tool to prevent premature CD without taking into account important maternal and neonatal outcomes. Thus, a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 7,845 women with term low-risk pregnancy from 2010 through 2014 was conducted to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes after implementation of the Zhang labor curves. Rosenbloom et al [25] reported that the primary CD rate did not decline between 2010 and 2014 (15.8% vs 17.7%, P = 0.5). In addition, maternal and neonatal morbidity significantly increased in the same time frame. A multicenter, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (LaPS trial) was conducted in 14 clusters in Norway; 7 obstetric units were randomly assigned to intervention (managed by Zhang\u2019s guidelines, n = 3,972) versus 7 units that were assigned to control (managed by the WHO partogram, n = 3,305). Again, the rate of intrapartum CD was not significantly different between the 2 groups [26].",
                "In this study, we hypothesized that the challenges associated with creation of labor charts are attributed to more than index population. Labor is a complex physiologic process, and outcomes are likely to be influenced by several factors. These factors can either be identifiable (determined at baseline) or unknown, yet they are indirectly reflected on labor course. Machine-learning algorithms have been increasingly used in data mining scenarios of large databases when the domain is poorly understood or when dynamic models are needed. Compared to conventional statistical methods, machine learning minimizes statistical assumption and works by identifying hidden patterns within data and incorporating evolving risks during the labor progression into outcome predictions. Therefore, the predictive power of these models is generally strong [27,28]. In this study, we used a large national database to create a series of dynamic prediction models, as an alternative to conventional labor charts, to predict labor outcomes. These models promote individualized assessment of labor progress based on patient characteristics and current labor patterns. They do not incorporate fixed definitions of latent labor, active labor, or rate of cervical dilation. Alternatively, an LRS graph can be used to determine the cumulative likelihood of safe labor, taking into account the likelihood of CD and any adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. A patient\u2019s baseline LRS, LRS trend over time, and LRS graph in relation to reference LRS graph can improve the intrapartum decision-making process.",
                "To our knowledge, this is the first study that implements machine-learning algorithms in labor management. The study is highly generalizable because it used a large national database with an ethnically diverse cohort of women that is not restricted by parity, previous CD, or certain maternal or neonatal outcomes. The study is limited by the retrospective nature of collected data. Furthermore, decision of CD obscures outcomes of further expectant management. However, these limitations are inherent in all labor and delivery studies due to ethical concerns of maternal and fetal exposure to unjustifiable risks. Fetal heart rate monitoring was not included in this study due to lack of documentation. Therefore, fetal heart tracing should be interpreted independently, and response to abnormal findings should be made per protocol. Other potential limitation of our study is the definition of the composite outcome, which is comprised of heterogenous adverse labor outcomes. However, the clinical rational for constructing this composite outcome is that the occurrence of any of the events in the composite outcome would trigger ending labor and expediting delivery. In addition, summarizing the risk in a single parameter like the one defined through our composite outcome can be easily interpreted by the obstetrician and the patient for counseling and decision-making purposes. Finally, the results of this study cannot be converted to a printed labor chart due to the complexity of machine-learning algorithms. However, a digital application is currently under development to facilitate clinical use of this developing tool."

LRS charts may be used as an efficient alternative to conventional labor charts. However, further prospective studies are warranted to assess outcomes of implementation of these models in labor units."
