                        "Total-field atomic magnetometers measure the magnitude of the magnetic field by directly measuring the Larmor precession frequency of the electron spins of alkali-metal atoms in the presence of the field. They can operate in geomagnetic fields (10-100 \u03bcT) and have a wide range of applications, including space magnetometry, fundamental physics experiments, biomedical imaging, archaeological mapping, mineral exploration, searches for unexploded ordnance, and magnetic navigation. The highest sensitivity for scalar magnetometers has been achieved in a pulsed pump-probe arrangement with a sensitivity of 0.54 fT/\u221a{square root over (Hz)} in a field of 7.3 \u03bcT. However, practical magnetometers need to operate in geomagnetic field around 50 \u03bcT.",
                        "Recently an all-optical pulsed gradiometer has reached a magnetometer sensitivity of 14 fT/\u221a{square root over (Hz)} over a broad range including Earth's field. One major and practical challenge of Earth's field magnetometers is the control of heading errors which otherwise significantly limit their accuracy. They cause the measured field values to depend on the orientation of the sensor with respect to the field, especially presenting problems for the magnetometry-based navigation.",
                        "All alkali-metal magnetometers suffer from heading errors because alkali-metal isotopes have nonzero nuclear spin of I>\u00bd. There are mainly two physical sources of heading errors: the nonlinear Zeeman splitting due to mixing of ground Zeeman states IF, m) and the difference in Larmor frequencies for the two hyperfine manifolds due to the nuclear magnetic moment. The non-linear splitting corresponds to a difference of 2.6 nT between neighboring Zeeman states for Rb-87 in a 50 \u03bcT field. At this field, the linear difference between Zeeman resonance frequencies in F=1 and F=2 states is 200 nT. These splittings of the Zeeman resonance lines produce broadening and asymmetries in the lineshape depending on the orientation of the sensor with respect to the field. For Rb-87 in a 50 \u03bcT field, the orientation-dependent shifts are on the order of 15 nT.",
                        "Previous approaches of reducing the heading errors in other alkali vapor systems have focused on suppressing the nonlinear Zeeman splitting, including double-modulated synchronous optical pumping, light polarization modulation, measurements of high-order polarization moments, use of tensor light-shift to cancel quadratic Zeeman splitting, and spin-locking with an additional radiofrequency (RF) field. However, they have some practical drawbacks such as complexity in implementation or requiring use of RF fields. These methods also do not cancel frequency shifts associated with the difference of Zeeman resonances for F=1 and F=2 states. In magnetometers operated with continuous optical pumping, the optimal sensitivity is achieved for spin polarization generally near 50%. As a result, there is usually a significant population in F=1 state which changes depending on the orientation of the magnetometer relative to the magnetic field.",
                        "As such, there is a need for an approach to reduce heading errors that avoid the above shortcomings."

                        "Alkali-metal atomic magnetometers suffer from heading errors in geomagnetic fields as the measured magnetic field depends on the orientation of the sensor with respect to the field. In addition to the nonlinear Zeeman splitting, the difference between Zeeman resonances in the two hyperfine ground states can also generate heading errors depending on initial spin polarization.",
                        "Generally disclosed herein are embodiments for suppressing heading errors in an all-optical scalar magnetometer that uses free precession of polarized Rb-87 atoms by varying the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field at different spin polarization regimes. In the high polarization limit where the lower hyperfine ground state F=1 is almost depopulated, it is shown that heading errors can be corrected with an analytical expression, reducing the errors by up to two orders of magnitude in Earth's field. The linearity of the measured Zeeman precession frequency is also verified with the magnetic field. With lower spin polarization, it is found that the splitting of the Zeeman resonances for the two hyperfine states causes beating in the precession signals and nonlinearity of the measured precession frequency with the magnetic field. The frequency shifts are corrected by using the unique probe geometry where two orthogonal probe beams measure opposite relative phases between the two hyperfine states during the spin precession.",
                        "Generally disclosed herein are embodiments for correcting heading errors as a function of both the direction and magnitude of magnetic field at a wide range of initial spin polarization. With the all-optical, free-precession Rb-87 magnetometer, a short-pulse pumping technique is used to achieve very high initial spin polarization near 95% regardless of the field orientation such that the initial spin state is well-defined. The population of F=1 state becomes negligible, and Zeeman coherences decay much faster in F=1 state than in F=2 state due to spin-exchange collisions between alkali-metal atoms. In this high polarization limit, the polarization-dependent heading errors can be minimized. It is also determined that the average Larmor frequency is given by an analytical expression that depends on the angle between the pump laser and the magnetic field. It is shown this angle can be determined directly from the spin precession signals. Thus, a correction for the heading error can be calculated in real time. After heading errors are corrected, it is found that the accuracy of the magnetometer is on the order of 0.1 nT as a function of both the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic field for fields up to 50 \u03bcT.",
                        "At lower spin polarization, interesting effects are observed due to non-negligible contribution from the F=1 state. The difference in Zeeman frequencies of F=1 and F=2 states generate beating which is observable in the measurement of spin precession signals. Moreover, the measured spin precession frequency is no longer linear with the magnetic field, even though the splitting itself is linear with the field. Here two probe beams are used to further correct for these heading errors: one is collinear to the pump beam, and the other is perpendicular to the pump. These orthogonal probe beams measure opposite relative phases of the two hyperfine ground states during their precession, allowing one to cancel any effects from the splitting in their Larmor frequency by averaging the two probe measurements. This is because Zeeman coherences precess around the magnetic field in opposite directions for F=1 and F=2 states. As a result, the additional frequency shifts are canceled by averaging the measurements of the two orthogonal probes. Furthermore, experimental results are compared with a density matrix simulation to easily separate signals from F=1 and F=2 states and investigate frequency shifts due to the nuclear magnetic moment.",

It is important to separate heading errors due to spin interactions from heading errors associated with remnant magnetization of magnetometer components. Rotation of the sensor relative to the field changes the projection of the remnant magnetic fields onto the leading field, resulting in frequency shifts that are hard to distinguish from atomic heading errors. The sensor was constructed with a minimal number of magnetic components. However, there are small amounts of polarizable ferrous materials present in the laser mounts and other electronic components. These components are degaussed, and heater electric currents are turned off during the measurement. Nevertheless, small offsets on the order of a few nT due to remnant magnetization of the sensor remained. To account for these offsets, the polarization of the pump laser was periodically reversed with a half-wave plate and measurements were taken with both polarizations. This approach is used to cancel heading errors by averaging the signals from the two pump polarizations. In this case the difference of the signals are taken to separate the heading errors due to the spin interaction and those due to magnetization of the components in the sensor head.",
                        "Heading Errors as a Function of the Sensor Orientation",
                        "FIG. 6 reports the measurement of heading errors in 10 \u03bcT and 50 \u03bcT fields as a function of the sensor's tilt angle \u03b8. If a difference is taken between the two measurements at opposite pump polarizations, the field values at \u03b8=0 are canceled to the order of 0.01 nT. The angle \u03b8 is determined from spin precession signals with an uncertainty of about 1\u00b0. Fitting to Eq. 4 gives an estimation of the initial polarization, about P=0.9 for the parallel probe signal and P=0.7 for the vertical probe signal. As described previously, the vertical probe has a smaller overlap with the pump beam than the horizontal probe and measures optical rotation from atoms that are less polarized. In a 10 \u03bcT field, the heading errors are expected to be only 4% of those in 50 \u03bcT. The inset of FIG. 6 shows that the residual errors are comparable and in fact slightly smaller for the case of B=50 \u03bcT. This indicates that the residuals are likely due to imperfection in the cancellation of remnant magnetization of sensor components. Even so, it is shown that the amplitude of heading errors due to atomic physics effects are reduced by about a factor of 50 for the horizontal probe measurement and a factor of 20 for the vertical probe measurement by the correction given by Eq. 4.",
                        "When the initial spin polarization is less than unity, there is some contribution from F=1 state. This manifests itself as an oscillation in the instantaneous spin precession frequency as illustrated in FIG. 7(a). The simulated spin precession signals are fit to Eq. 5 in individual time segments of 0.05 ms to show the time dependence of the spin precession frequency. It is found that it oscillates at 1.4 kHz, which is equal to the difference between Zeeman frequencies for F=1 and F=2 states at 50 \u03bcT. It is confirmed that at other magnetic fields the beating frequency is proportional to the magnetic field. As expected, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes larger for smaller spin polarization. The decay rate of the oscillations depends on the T2 of the F=1 coherences. This beating effect is not sensitive to the orientation of the sensor, so the oscillations at \u03b8=0 and \u03b8=45\u00b0 are similar. However, for \u03b8=45\u00b0 one can observe a small additional slow drift of the spin precession frequency. This drift is due to differences in the relaxation rate of F=2 coherences, as discussed in more detail in the next section.",
                        "It is found that the oscillations in the instantaneous spin precession frequency have opposite sign for the horizontal and vertical probe beams, as illustrated in FIG. 7(b). As the two hyperfine states have opposite spin precession directions, the horizontal probe detects maximum signal when SxF=2 and SxF=1 are out of phase while the vertical probe detects maximum signal when they are in phase. Therefore, the frequency oscillation can be canceled by averaging the two probe measurements, which reduces the amplitude of frequency oscillations by more than two orders of magnitude. This was experimentally verified as shown in the inset of FIG. 7(b), which is based on fitting the experimental signal to Eq. 5. The two probe measurements show opposite sign of frequency oscillation. The oscillations are larger for the vertical probe beam because it detects a lower average spin polarization. The amplitudes of the experimentally observed oscillations in the instantaneous spin precession frequency appear larger than those predicted by the simulation. This could be due to spatial non-uniformity of the polarization in the cell which is not considered in the simulation.",
                        "Heading Errors as a Function of the Absolute Magnetic Field",
                        "In addition to investigating heading errors as a function of the angular orientation of the sensor, heading errors are also examined as a function of the absolute magnetic field. The spin precession frequencies are measured as a function of magnetic fields at high (P=0.85) and low (P=0.2) polarizations with the vertical probe. For these measurements it is necessary to create a well-controlled linear magnetic field ramp. The measurements are performed inside magnetic shields which generate a significant hysteresis of the magnetic field. To create a reproducible magnetic field a stair-case ramp is applied as illustrated in FIG. 8. The magnetic field scan is repeated several times without interruptions. The current through the magnetic field coil is monitored using a precision shunt resistor while the repetition rate of the optical pumping pulses is continuously adjusted under computer control to match the Larmor frequency. After several up and down sweeps, both the field and frequency measurements are averaged during the same time period to suppress any field fluctuations.",
                        "FIG. 9 shows the measured precession frequency as a function of fields with P=0.85 at \u03b8=0\u00b0. With a quadratic fitting function, the frequency for upward and downward field sweeps show high curvature with opposite signs. This is due to the magnetic shield hysteresis, and averaging the two measurements reduces the curvature and residuals of linear fitting by two orders of magnitude.",
                        "FIG. 10 shows results of averaging the upward and downward field sweep measurements at two different polarizations P=0.2 and 0.85. Even though the first order heading error correction at \u03b8=0\u00b0 is zero from Eq. 4, the low polarization result (P=0.2) shows a curvature of \u221216\u00d710\u22124 Hz/\u03bcT2, much higher than the curvature for high spin polarization (P=0.85) of 2\u00d710\u22124 Hz/\u03bcT2.",
                        "FIG. 11 shows the simulated curvature as a function of polarization. The curvature is negligible in high polarization limit but starts to increase at P<0.7. The curvature C=16.52\u00d710\u22124 Hz/\u03bcT2 at P=0.2 with the vertical probe agrees well with experimental measurement. This nonlinear frequency shift is due to the increase in population of F=1 state. The horizontal and vertical probe beams have opposite curvature signs. Therefore, averaging of the two signals can cancel the non-linearity of the frequency, similar to the cancellation of the instantaneous frequency oscillations described previously.",
                        "To understand the origin of the non-linearity the evolution of individual coherences is simulated. When \u03b8=0\u00b0 the F=2 state has two distinct coherences and F=1 state has one distinct coherence. Their initial amplitudes and relaxation are shown in FIG. 12 for P=0.85 and P=0.2. The relative strength of F=1 coherence is much higher at P=0.2 than at P=0.85. As the nuclear spin causes splitting of Zeeman frequencies between two hyperfine states, their interference can generate the observed frequency shift at low polarization. To check the origin of the non-linearity, the nuclear magnetic moment is nulled in the simulation by setting gI=0. The curvature at P=0.2 then reduced to C=0.2\u00d710\u22124 Hz/\u03bcT2. This suggests that the nonlinear frequency shift at low polarization is caused by the linear Zeeman interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment."

                        "In the high spin polarization limit, heading errors can be corrected for by using analytical expression which is derived based on the density matrix formalism. With the correction, the measured field accuracy is about 0.1 nT in a 50 \u03bcT Earth's field. The linearity of the measured Zeeman frequency is verified with respect to the field up to Earth's field with a deviation of less than 0.05 nT. At lower polarization, additional heading errors are observed due to the difference in Larmor frequency of the F=1 and F=2 states. This generates beating in the measured frequency, and it is no longer linear with the magnetic field. Numerical simulation shows that this nonlinearity is caused by the linear Zeeman interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment. To cancel these frequency shifts, measurements from two orthogonal probe beams that measure opposite relative phases between the two hyperfine coherences are averaged.",
