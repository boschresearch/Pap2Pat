# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to dd-cfDNA monitoring

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate need for allograft health monitoring

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce one-genome method for dd-cfDNA monitoring
- describe algorithm and its applications

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Quantifying Dd-cfDNA in Lung and Heart Transplant Recipients

- develop statistical approach
- quantify donor- and recipient-derived cfDNA

### Performance of Lung and Heart Rejection Predictions

- compare one-genome and two-genome methods
- evaluate performance in lung transplant recipients
- evaluate performance in heart transplant recipients

### Accuracy of Dd-cfDNA Level Estimations in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients

- refine one-genome method for bone marrow transplants

### Differentiating Between Relapse and Graft Versus Host Disease in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients

- use GTD to monitor bone marrow transplant health

### Methods Section

- collect cfDNA sequencing and genotype data
- filter low-quality reads
- map reads to human genome
- remove biased and duplicated reads
- compute chromosomal coverage
- count cfDNA reads containing each SNP allele
- define model parameters
- model genotyping error rate
- model sequencing error rate
- model donor genotype probability
- model probability of cfDNA containing specific allele
- define likelihood function
- estimate donor-derived cfDNA in unrelated recipients
- estimate donor-derived cfDNA in related recipients

## Data and Materials Availability

- provide data and materials sources
