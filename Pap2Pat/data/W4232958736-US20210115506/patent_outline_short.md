# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to dd-cfDNA monitoring

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate need for allograft health monitoring

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce one-genome method for dd-cfDNA monitoring

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Quantifying Dd-cfDNA in Lung and Heart Transplant Recipients

- develop one-genome model

### Performance of Lung and Heart Rejection Predictions

- compare one-genome and two-genome methods

### Accuracy of Dd-cfDNA Level Estimations in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients

- extend one-genome model for bone marrow transplants

### Differentiating Between Relapse and Graft Versus Host Disease in Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients

- apply GTD to monitor bone marrow transplant health

### Methods Section

- collect cfDNA sequencing and genotype data
- filter and process sequencing reads
- estimate allele representation in cfDNA fragments
- model donor-derived cfDNA in unrelated recipients
- model donor-derived cfDNA in related recipients
- estimate model parameters using likelihood function
- compare predictability of one-genome and two-genomes methods

## Data and Materials Availability

- provide data and materials sources
