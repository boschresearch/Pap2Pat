                        "Quantification of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in circulating blood derived from a transplanted organ is a powerful approach to monitoring post-transplant injury. Genome Transplant Dynamics (GTD) quantifies donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) by taking advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the genome to discriminate donor and recipient DNA molecules. In its current implementation, GTD requires genotyping of both the transplant recipient and donor. However, in practice, donor genotype information is often unavailable.",
                        "In this invention, we address this issue by developing an algorithm that estimates dd-cfDNA levels in the absence of a donor genotype. The method predicts heart and lung allograft rejection with an accuracy that is similar to conventional GTD. We furthermore refined the method to handle closely related recipients and donors, a scenario that is common in bone marrow and kidney transplantation. We show that it is possible to estimate dd-cfDNA in bone marrow transplant patients that are unrelated or that are siblings of the donors, using a hidden Markov model (HMM) of identity-by-descent (IBD) states along the genome. Last, we demonstrate that comparing dd-cfDNA to the proportion of donor DNA in white blood cells can differentiate between relapse and the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These methods alleviate some of the barriers to the implementation of GTD, which will further widen its clinical application.",
                        "In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a method of quantifying transplant-derived circulating donor-derived cell-free DNA in the absence of a donor genotype according to the following steps: (a) extracting a blood sample from a transplant recipient; (b)isolating circulating nucleotide acids from the plasma of the extracted blood sample; (c) performing an unbiased sequencing on the isolated circulating nucleotide acids using a first computer-implemented method; (d) estimating and quantifying the donor-derived cell-free DNA based on genotyping from only the transplant recipient using a second computer-implemented method; and (e) outputting the quantified transplant-derived circulating donor-derived cell-free DNA. Both computer-implemented methods and the outputting are executed by a computer device. It is noted that the method does not use targeted PCR amplification. The step of genotyping from only the transplant recipient could be based on genotyping array, cell-free DNA sequencing or low coverage whole genome sequencing followed by imputations.",

To quantify the observed abundance of alleles of each genotyped SNP in cfDNA sequences (FIG. 5), we first filter low quality reads, reads that are not mapped uniquely to the genome, and reads with potential for mapping biased by genetic variability. We then remove duplicated reads and count allele appearances of each genotyped SNP (SAMtools mpileup function). We use all genotyped SNPs, as opposed to the \u201ctwo genomes\u201d method that uses only SNPs that are homozygous but differ between recipient and donor. The observed allele appearances in cfDNA and the recipient genotype are the inputs for our \u201cone-genome\u201d model.",
                                "To calculate the probability of the observed cfDNA, we first calculate the probability of each possible donor and recipient genotype. Recipient genotype depends on the recipient measured genotype and the genotyping error rate. Vital organ transplants are rarely closely related. Therefore, for heart and lung transplants, our model assumes that the donor genotype is randomly selected from a human population. Given this assumption, the probability of a specific donor allele is its frequency in the population. Our algorithm iterates over 1000 Genomes Project populations and super-populations to detect the most likely ancestral population of the donor. This model achieves satisfying performance in lung and heart transplant but might need refinement for handling bone marrow transplant in which donor and recipients are often related.",
                                "Putting it together, the probability of observing a specific allele in a cfDNA fragment is computed by integrating over all possible recipient and donor genotypes and depends on the sequencing error rate, the fraction of dd-cfDNA in the recipient plasma and the probabilities of observing the allele conditioning on it being donor- or recipient-derived (FIG. 1A indicated (a)). Finally, we compute the log-likelihood of the data by summing log-likelihoods over all SNPs, assuming SNPs are independent (this assumption is also made by the two-genomes method). We use an optimization algorithm to find the maximum likelihood parameter values."

We find that the predictions of dd-cfDNA level in lung recipients (51 patients, 382 samples) are highly correlated between the two methods (Pearson's R2=0.99, Spearman's \u03c1=0.94; FIG. 2A). Accordingly, the two methods also performed similarly in differentiating between different levels of organ rejection (as measured by biopsy; FIG. 2C). For heart transplant recipients (59 patients, 435 samples) dd-cfDNA level estimates of the two methods were highly correlated (Pearson's R2=0.99, Spearman's \u03c1=0.67; FIG. 2B). However, the agreement between the two methods is not as high as in the lung cohort, especially when dd-cfDNA levels are below \u02dc0.5%. This may be because samples that contain very low fractions of dd-cfDNA are less informative regarding the donor genotype, making the inference harder. The two-genome method performs slightly better in differentiating between grades of acute rejection, although the differences were mostly non-significant; therefore, its dd-cfDNA estimates may be slightly more accurate (FIG. 2D). We conclude that donor genotyping is not required for lung transplant recipients. Donor genotyping can also be avoided in heart transplant recipients, but the accuracy of the test may be reduced slightly.",

                                "Because bone marrow donors are often close relatives of the recipients, the assumption that the donor is randomly selected from the population no longer holds. Chromosomes of closely-related individuals contain long segments of identical genotype. These segments are said to be identical by descent (IBD). The abundance and length of the IBD segments depend on the number of meioses separating the two chromosomes and the recombination rate. Ignoring IBD may lead to under-estimation of dd-cfDNA level. We therefore extended our model account for possible IBD by learning recipient-donor relatedness. We implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with three states (FIG. 1; see Methods Section infra for details): when there is no IBD (IBD=0), the model emission probabilities are similar to the above unrelated donor-recipient model; when one pair of chromosomes is IBD (IBD=1), the genotype of one donor allele will be similar to one of the recipient alleles and the other donor allele likelihood depends on its abundance in the population (independently of the recipient genotype); lastly, when both chromosome pairs are in IBD (IBD=2) the recipient and donor genotypes are identical. In our model, transitions between IBD states can occur only between pre-calculated 2 centimorgan blocks. Transition probabilities depend on the recipient-donor relatedness, which is represented by the number of meioses separating each pair of donor-recipient chromosomes (FIG. 1B indicated by (b)). In other words, in our model, the donor genotype depends on the population allele frequency and the recipient genotype according to the local IBD state."

As expected, the na\u00efve implementation of the one-genome method underestimates dd-cfDNA in sibling donors (FIGS. 3A-B) that share about 50% of their genotype due to IBD (FIGS. 3A-B), but not in unrelated donors.

Reassuringly, these predictions strongly correlate with the fraction of reads originating from the X chromosomes when the donor and recipient sex is different (FIGS. 6A-D).

The current gold standard for a successful engraftment is absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 for three consecutive days. This corresponds to 47-82% dd-cfDNA in our patients (FIGS. 6A-D). We notice that in patients who relapse (patients I3) or have acute GVHD (patients I1 and I8) or chronic GVHD (patients I2), the level of cfDNA drops after reaching its peak (24%, 33%, 11% and 24%, respectively).

In the case of a cancer relapse, the fraction of lymphocytes of recipient origin increases. The cfDNA will therefore reflect increasing levels of recipient-origin lymphocytes. On the other hand, in the case of GVHD, the fraction of lymphocytes from recipient origin does not increase. In this case, the increase in dd-cfDNA is caused by injury to recipient tissues. We therefore hypothesized that differences in the recipient-origin DNA in the cellular and plasma (cell-free) fractions can distinguish between relapse and GVHD. As a proof of principle, we sequenced both the cfDNA and the cellular fraction in patient I8. In agreement with our hypothesis, the two values match until the onset of the acute GVHD (since most cfDNA originates from lymphocytes) and then diverge\u2014after the onset of GVHD, the cellular fraction remains low and cfDNA level increases (FIG. 4). This \u201cN of one\u201d experiment demonstrates the great potential of GTD to distinguish between relapses and GVHD\u2014an urgent unmet need in the field."

Additional dd-cfDNA measurements were performed for bone marrow transplant patients (8 patients, 76 samples), using methods previously described [8,9]. In short, recipient plasma was collected at several time points before the transplant procedure (two time points) and at several time points after transplantation sequenced. cfDNA was purified from plasma and sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 200 or HiSeq 2500 1\u00d750 bp or 2\u00d7100 bp). Donor and recipient genotyping was performed using Illumina whole-genome arrays HumanOmni2.5-8 or HumanOmni1 prior to the transplant.",

                                "Several steps were applied to the cfDNA sequencing reads to achieve counts of allele representation for each genotyped SNP. First, low quality reads were filtered out (reads in which more than 50% of the base qualities are below 20). Second, reads were mapped to the human genome (UCSC version hg19) using bowtie2 [28] (with the following parameters: -D 20 -R 3 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.50 -I 20 -X 500 --no-mixed --no-discordant --no-unal -t) and SAMtools [29] was used to filter paired ends reads where one of the reads was unmapped (flags -f 3 -F 3852 for pair ends reads and -F 3844 for single end reads) or reads with P>0.05 to be mapped non-uniquely. Third, WASP [14] was applied to remove reads in which the mapping may be biased by the genotype. Fourth, duplicated reads (reads that map to the same exact location) were removed by scripts that selects randomly which of the duplicated reads to keep and is therefore not biased towards a specific genotype. Fifth, chromosomal coverage was computed using HTSeq [30]. Sixth, the number of cfDNA reads that contain each SNP allele was computed using SAMtools mpileup function. These counts were used as input for the model.",

Therefore, our model assumes that the donor was randomly selected from some ancestral population. This is clearly an assumption\u2014donors may have a mixed ancestry and their MHC is often matched to the recipient MHC\u2014nonetheless we find that we can achieve good performance by making this assumption (we note that modeling of mixed ancestry did not improved the predictions). Given the population from which the donor was drawn, the prior probability of observing each allele in the donor is exactly the allele frequency in the population (assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). Since the donor population is unknown, the optimization function iterates over 1000 Genomes project populations and super-population [16] and selects the population that maximize the likelihood. The goal of the model is to estimate the fraction of cfDNA that is donor-derived (dd-cfDNA) given the recipient measured genotype and the cfDNA reads (FIG. 1 indicated by (a)).",

Therefore, the assumption that the donor is drawn randomly from the population is no longer valid. Closely-related individuals share stretches of identical haplotypes that were inherited from a recent common ancestor, a phenomenon known as Identity By Descent (IBD). For each pair of chromosomes, IBD segments' length distribution and total length depend on the number of meioses from their Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA). The model accounts for IBD using a non-homogenous Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in which each position in the genome can be in one of three states IBD=0, IBD=1 or IBD=2 in which 0,1, or 2 pairs of chromosomes are identical by descent (FIG. 1 indicated by \u201cb\u201d). For efficiency and to avoid strong effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD), transitions are allowed only between \u02dc2 cM blocks, which are pre-calculated using a recombination rate map [22]. In each block, each one of the two haploid pairs of donor-recipient genomes can be in IBD or no-IBD state. The transitions between the IBD states for each haploid pair depend on the average genetic distance between the blocks and the marginal probability of the pair to be IBD, similar to the plink method [13].
