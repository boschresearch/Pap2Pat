Quantum amplitude estimation can accelerate derivative pricing quadratically in the target error and this may be extended to a quadratic error scaling advantage in market risk computation. Employing quantum gradient estimation algorithms can deliver a further quadratic advantage in the number of the associated market sensitivities, called greeks. By numerically simulating the quantum gradient estimation algorithms on financial derivatives of practical interest, example greeks can be successfully estimated, while the resource requirements can be significantly lower in practice than what is expected by theoretical complexity bounds. This additional advantage in the computation lowers the estimated logical clock rate used for quantum advantage from Chakrabarti (arXiv:2012.03819) by a factor of \u02dc7, from 50 MHz to 7 MHz, even for a modest number of greeks by industry standards (four). Moreover, using a system with sufficient resources, the quantum algorithm can be parallelized across up to 60 QPUs, in which case the logical clock rate of each device used to achieve the same overall runtime as the serial execution is \u02dc100 kHz. Throughout this disclosure, several different combinations of quantum and classical approaches that may be used for computing the market risk of financial derivatives (among other things) are summarized and compared."

                                "Quantum algorithms have the potential to accelerate certain real-world calculations, such as the pricing and risk analysis of financial derivatives. Some of these algorithms use quantum amplitude estimation to achieve quadratic advantage compared to the classical Monte Carlo methods that are used in practice for most computationally expensive pricing. Let \u03f5p be the error in pricing. The quantum advantage stems from the runtime of a classical Monte Carlo simulation scaling as (1/\u03f5p2), while the quantum algorithms have scaling (1/\u03f5p).",
                                "A related and important financial application is the computation of the sensitivity of derivative prices to model and market parameters. This amounts to computing gradients of the derivative price with respect to input parameters. An example business use of calculating these gradients is to enable hedging of the market risk that arises from exposure to derivative contracts. Hedging this risk may be of critical importance to financial firms. In some cases, gradients can be computed analytically, e.g. when the derivative price has an analytical form. In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods computes gradients where there is not a closed form for the price and where the classical comparison is to Monte Carlo simulation. Gradients of financial derivatives are typically called greeks, as these quantities are commonly labeled using Greek alphabet letters. For k greeks (a k-dimensional gradient) classical finite difference methods may compute the price at multiple points in each parameter dimension for a scaling of (k/\u03f5p2).",
                                "One approach to quantum acceleration of greek computation is to construct a finite difference approximation of the financial derivative's price on a quantum computer and perform amplitude estimation on that quantity instead of its price. Sec. 2.4 demonstrates that this approach, called the semi-classical method, scales as (k/c), where c is the target error for the gradients. However, one can further improve the scaling in the number of greeks k, using quantum algorithms for computing the gradients.",
                                "A quantum algorithm to compute a gradient's components in superposition was originally introduced by Jordan (arXiv:quant-ph/0405146) and more recently revisited by Gily\u00e9n (arXiv:1711.00465), however these references do not consider applying the quantum algorithm to greek computations. Gily\u00e9n perform an analysis of Jordan's original quantum gradient algorithm to show that in general it scales as (k/\u03f52). Gily\u00e9n then generalizes the algorithm to arbitrary higher order m and shows that an order m=log(\u221a{square root over (k)}/\u03f5) quantum gradient algorithm has runtime of (\u221a{square root over (k)}/\u03f5E) for a specific class of smooth functions. For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of this disclosure we refer to this result as the GAW quantum gradient algorithm.",

The quantum pricing method of Chakrabarti is used as a subroutine to the GAW algorithm to numerically estimate the resource requirements of computing the greeks of two types of option contracts: (a) a European call option, which can be used as a benchmark to establish the validity of the algorithm and estimate the corresponding resource requirements, and (b) a path-dependent basket option with a pricing profile that is representative of typical financial derivative contracts of practical interest.",

This Simulation-Free Quantum Gradient (SFQG) method may be used to compute the greeks of a path-dependent derivative and can be significantly cheaper to construct than the Hamiltonian-based method. Additionally, the disclosed approaches can improve the overall performance of quantum gradient estimation algorithms by employing a maximum likelihood (MLE) method to extract the most likely estimate of the gradients with concrete confidence intervals. With these tools, quantum advantage for calculating risk may be achievable with quantum computers whose clock rates are seven times slower than those for pricing itself. This is described in more detail in Section 7.",

CNOT gates (controlled by qubits in the first set of k registers of n qubits) are then used to create a copy of each |x (in a second set of k registers of n qubits), which allows evaluation of the oracles OS\u03b8+\u2261+\u03c0S+ and OS\u03b8\u2212\u2261\u2212\u03c0S\u2212 in parallel at the cost of extra qubits. After uncomputing the copies using another set of CNOT gates (controlled by qubits in the first set of k registers of n qubits), an n-dimensional inverse Quantum Fourier Transform is applied to each of the initial k registers in the first set to give the state of Eq.

More specifically, pricing the autocallable contract studied in Chakrabarti using the reparameterization technique introduced therein to within \u03f5\u22642\u00d710\u22123 with confidence level 1\u2212\u03b1=0.68 requires a T-depth of 5\u00d7107. As such, in order to match the classical Monte Carlo pricing time estimated as 1 second, a logical quantum clock may use a rate of 50 MHz. The same reparameterization technique from Chakrabarti may be used to construct oracle size estimates and estimate the T-depth of the quantum circuit for the SFQG method to compute the four greeks of the basket option of Sec. 4.1.2 and Table 4. To calculate the greeks to within the same \u03f5\u22642\u00d710\u22123 and confidence level 1\u2212\u03b1=0.68, the SFQG method may be used with the parameters of FIG. 4 and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method from Sec. 6 using 60 shots (see FIG. 5b). Using these parameters provides an estimate that the total T-depth of the SFQG circuit multiplied by the number of shots is 5.5\u00d7107, with the end-to-end circuit using 12k logical qubits and execution of T-gates at a code distance that can support 108 logical operations. Assuming the contract can be classically priced using Monte Carlo in 1 second to within the same error and confidence level and that the greeks can be calculated using a second-order finite-difference method applied to Monte Carlo pricings, the greeks of the basket option can be classically estimated in 8 seconds (four greeks, two pricings per greek). Therefore, quantum advantage using the SFQG method in calculating the greeks of this derivative contract may include executing T-gates at a rate of 7 MHz, which is 7 times lower than the estimate of Chakrabarti for quantum advantage in derivative pricing. Moreover, because the quantum gradient circuit is sampled 60 times when the MLE method is used (see FIG. 5), providing parallel access to 60 QPUs on which the quantum circuit can be loaded and sampled simultaneously enables achieving the same runtime as the serial execution if the logical cock rate of each device is \u02dc100 kHz, which is closer to current estimates of feasible logical clock rates around 10 kHz.",
                                "While the computational cost for the numerical simulations of the SFQG method currently limits the analysis to a maximum of k=4 greeks for practically relevant use cases, the SFQG method can scale favorably to derivative pricing problems of higher dimensionality, motivated by the fact that most, if not all, derivative contracts of practical interest have piecewise-linear payoffs. While Theorem 1 provides a complexity of (\u221a{square root over (k)}/\u03f5) for the class of functions considered, it does not preclude higher-order speedups with respect to k for smoother functions. For instance, the SFQG method applied to simple polynomial functions can achieve a complexity of (log(k)/\u03f5). Derivative contracts often include market parameters with little or no cross-dependence, e.g., \u2202n\u0192/(\u2202x1m\u2202x2n\u2212m)\u02dc0 for n>1, m\u2208[1, n\u22121]. For example, the basket option from Sec. 4.1.2 without the knock-in feature \u2202nV/(\u2202Sin\u2202Sjn\u2212m)=0. The absence of such higher-order terms allows us to pick values of m and l in the application of the SFQG method which lead to smaller overall oracular cost than what is specified by Theorem 1. An example upper bound on the potential advantage compared to classical Monte Carlo is the case where the function is at most a second-degree polynomial in all k variables, yielding an overall speedup of (k). Therefore, the possible extent of quantum speedup of the SFQG method may be dependent on the nature of the price function for each derivative. Assuming the SFQG method can be applied to larger number of k (as argued above), then one or more of the above advantages may apply to the GAW m=1 method as well. However, the SFQG method is still cheaper to construct than the GAW method, as indicated by Table 4."

                                "Among other things, this disclosure provides a new application of the GAW algorithm and a new modification to the GAW algorithm. Specifically, this disclosure describes using a modified version of the GAW algorithm (m=1) to compute gradients of financial derivatives (greeks)(even if it is unclear whether the functions of interest satisfy Theorem 1). For example, as shown in Table 4, while theory of the GAW algorithm dictates that m should be 4, this disclosure demonstrates that m=1 can be used. This demonstrates that additional quantum advantage is possible in risk analysis, on top of the quadratic speedup of derivative pricing. Classically computing k greeks with finite-difference methods\u2014when the underlying derivative is priced using Monte Carlo\u2014has complexity (k/\u03f52) and straightforward extension of finite-difference methods to derivative pricing using amplitude estimation provides a quadratic advantage with complexity (k/\u03f5). In this disclosure, the modified GAW algorithm provides an additional quadratic advantage for overall complexity of (\u221a{square root over (k)}/\u03f5). Theorem 1 specifies this quadratic advantage with respect to the number of greeks when the pricing function satisfies the smoothness conditions of Theorem 1. However, because derivative pricing problems of practical interest in finance involve numerous diverse multivariate price functions and generally have no analytical solutions, understanding whether and which financial derivatives satisfy the aforementioned smoothness conditions may be a challenging task. For this reason, numerical methods were employed to simulate the modified GAW algorithm for two example derivatives: a) a European call option which has a closed-form solution and is used to establish the validity and benchmarks of the algorithm and b) a path-dependent basket option which has no known analytical solution and is representative of typical derivative price functions. The results not only succeed in estimating the associated greeks for these examples with high probability, but the resulting query complexity is significantly smaller than that suggested by Theorem 1 (e.g., See Tables 3 and 4).",
                                "This disclosure also provides a rigorous resource estimation of the quantum oracles involved in the above modified GAW algorithm. Due to the extra cost associated with the block-encoding and Hamiltonian simulation used to approximately construct the phase oracle of Eq. (15) from the probability oracle of Eq. (1) used in derivative pricing, Sec. 5 of this disclosure develops new methods (the SFQG methods) to construct a cheaper, second-order (m=1) phase oracle by taking advantage of the structure of amplitude estimation.",
                                "Sec. 6 shows that quantum gradient algorithms (e.g., the SFQG methods) may be enhanced by employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), allowing us to determine the resources used to estimate gradients with precise confidence intervals and confidence levels. Using this MLE method, Sec. 7 describes estimating the resources used for quantum advantage in derivative market risk for typical use cases of practical interest. Employing quantum gradient methods in derivative pricing can lower the logical clock rate estimate for quantum advantage described in Chakrabarti (arXiv:2012.03819) by a factor of seven.",
                                "While finite-difference methods may be used to compute greeks, classical automatic differentiation (AD) methods may also be used. AD methods may be advantageous because of their ability to significantly reduce the associated computational costs, at the cost of increased memory footprint. In particular, the adjoint mode of automatic differentiation (AAD) in certain cases allows the computation of all k gradients of a scalar function \u0192 at a cost which is independent of k, meaning that the overall classical complexity cost in this case becomes (\u03c9/\u03b52), for some constant co depending on the function \u0192. For example, while the complexity of the GAW quantum gradient estimation algorithm scales as (\u221a{square root over (k)}/\u03f5) for the class of smooth functions in Theorem 1, in Sec. 4.1 we saw that for practical use cases in finance, the algorithm scales 100\u00d7-200\u00d7 times better than the theoretical estimate from Theorem 1 for a given \u03f5 (e.g., See Tables 3 and 4). As such, depending on the practical scaling of the GAW algorithm to larger values of k for finance use cases, it is possible that it could also outperform the complexity of AAD methods. Note that if the GAW algorithm outperforms AD, then the SFQG methods do as well. However, SFQG methods can outperform AD even if the GAW algorithm does not, since SFQG methods are cheaper than GAW as shown in the examples studied. It is also interesting to consider whether a similar construct as that employed by AD can be applied in a quantum setting. Section 9 provides such a construct and shows that in certain settings it can lead to similar performance profile as classical AD, in that the runtime of the algorithm is independent of the number of greeks at the expense of increased memory usage.",

For example, based on the results described herein, further quantum advantage in the derivative pricing subroutine may be leveraged at these higher levels of calculation and aggregation.",

                                "Illustrated in FIG. 9 are at least one processor 902 coupled to a chipset 904. Also coupled to the chipset 904 are a memory 906, a storage device 908, a keyboard 910, a graphics adapter 912, a pointing device 914, and a network adapter 916. A display 918 is coupled to the graphics adapter 912. In one embodiment, the functionality of the chipset 904 is provided by a memory controller hub 920 and an I/O hub 922. In another embodiment, the memory 906 is coupled directly to the processor 902 instead of the chipset 904. In some embodiments, the computer 900 includes one or more communication buses for interconnecting these components. The one or more communication buses optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components.",

In addition, the computer 900 can lack certain illustrated components. In one embodiment, a computer 900 acting as a server may lack a keyboard 910, pointing device 914, graphics adapter 912, or display 918. Moreover, the storage device 908 can be local or remote from the computer 900 (such as embodied within a storage area network (SAN)).",

These algorithmic descriptions and representations are commonly used by those skilled in the computing arts to convey the substance of their work effectively to others skilled in the art. These operations, while described functionally, computationally, or logically, are understood to be implemented by computer programs comprising instructions for execution by a processor or equivalent electrical circuits, microcode, or the like. Furthermore, it has also proven convenient at times, to refer to these arrangements of functional operations as modules, without loss of generality. In some cases, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software.",

For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, \u201cor\u201d refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).",
