Nickel can be in different or even mixed oxidation states, ranging from +2, +3 to +4. The anions can contain a single nickel ion, or multiple ions to form a cluster ion. The solid mixed oxide compounds are often insulating, but can also be metallic. They have a variety of electrical and magnetic properties. Rare-earth elements form a range of perovskite nickelates, in which the properties vary systematically as the rare-earth element changes.

                        "Unless defined otherwise, the scientific and technology nomenclatures have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person in the ordinary skill in the art pertaining to this disclosure.",
                        "Functional interfaces between electronics and biological matter are essential to diverse fields including health sciences (e.g. detection of early stage diseases), soft robotics (e.g. sensory interfaces for autonomous systems), bio-engineering and search for life in extreme environments in land or water bodies on Earth, other planets or asteroids. Energy and information flow in biological and living matter occurs through ionic currents, however in traditional semiconductor devices, it is due to electrons and holes. Functional interfaces between biological and synthetic matter therefore can greatly benefit from simultaneous ion-electron transfer coupled with signaling capability in a range of biological and body/brain environments. Synthetic matter that responds to reaction intermediates at low concentrations therefore can be game-changing in this context, however must be functional near room (or body) temperature while constantly exposed to complex biological media. As a promising candidate, the perovskite nickelate SmNiO3 (SNO, space group Pbnm), is water-stable, and belongs to a class of strongly correlated quantum materials, whose properties are highly sensitive to the occupancy of electrons in their partially-filled orbitals. When doped with charge carriers, SNO shows massive electronic structure changes: For one electron/unit cell doping from hydrogen, the electrical resistance changes by \u02dc10 orders of magnitude.",
                        "This disclosure provides a new device and system to detect biological molecules (such as glucose and dopamine) down to ultra-low concentrations. This device is based on rare earth perovskite nickelate RNiO3 (R can be Sm, Nd, Eu, Gd, Dy, Y, Lu, Pr, La, etc). FIG. 2 shows the sensing mechanism and device where the electrical resistance of the device changes (increases) with the presence of biological molecules. In this sensing process, hydrogen atoms from the biological molecules are first transferred to an enzyme, and then into the RNiO3 lattice. This process occurs spontaneously without the need for any external energy input. The hydrogen then bonds with oxygen anions and occupies interstitial sites among the oxygen octahedra in RNiO3, contributing an electron to the d orbitals of nickel. As a result, the singly occupied Ni eg orbitals in glucose-reacted RNiO3 become doubly occupied and the additional electron in the eg orbital imposes large on-site Mott-Hubbard electron-electron repulsion, leading to localization of the charge carriers and resistivity increase. Such a hydrogen-induced conduction suppression serves as a unique and ultra-sensitive platform for chemical transduction at the interface between the nickelate films and biological molecules. Schematic figure of the enzyme-RNiO3 device is presented in FIG. 2 (b). The enzymes are anchored on a gold electrode via cystamine bonding and transfer hydrogen from biological molecules to the perovskite channel. The sensing function can be initiated by adding biological molecules on top of the device surface.",
                        "After the biological molecules were added, the resistance of the perovskite nickelate device increased, due to the hydrogen transfer and its consequential electron localization as described in FIG. 2. The perovskite nickelate devices are highly responsive to dilute biological molecule concentrations and showed good selectivity. For the responsivity test, the perovskite nickelate devices were soaked in glucose and dopamine solutions with different concentrations for one hour and then the resistance ratio (R/R0) was plotted in FIG. 3. In all the cases, the device resistance increased after the reaction, and R/R0 becomes larger with increasing glucose concentration, and the detection limit is determined as 5\u00d710\u221216 M and 5\u00d710\u221217 M for glucose and dopamine, respectively (signal to noise ratio >3). The high detection limit in our perovskite nickelate devices is a unique attribute of strong electron correlations, a quantum mechanical effect wherein miniscule perturbation to the electron occupancy of orbitals can result in giant modulation of the transport gap. The devices were also found functional at body temperature (37\u00b0 C.) and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) environment.",
                        "The advantages of this technique include sensing bio-molecules (such as dopamine and glucose) down to ultralow concentration, one order better than current state of the art techniques. Additionally, the sensing process is spontaneous, and no external energy is required in this process.",
                        "It is contemplated that strongly correlated oxides (such as but not limited to rare earth perovskite nickelate, and related transition metal oxides such as NiO, FeOx) are used as biomolecule sensors.",
                        "Without limiting to any particular theory, it is contemplated to use the strong election correlation effect in this class of materials to achieve high detection limit.",
                        "Exemplified but not limited to any particular theory, enzymes or other catalysts that facilitate proton transfer between bio-molecules and strongly correlated oxides is shown to be effective to sense bio-molecules.",
                        "Without being limited by any theory, it is also contemplated that other than resistivity change of strongly correlated oxides due to the proton transfer, change of optical, magnetic and thermal properties can also be utilized as possible sensing means.",
                        "Arrays of such devices can be fabricated to design large scale circuits on a chip to rapidly sense bio-molecules. Micro-fluidic channels can be integrated with such devices to direct flow of fluids onto the surfaces and sense presence of bio-matter. Various enzymes can be positioned at discrete devices and simultaneously several classes of bio-molecules can be sensed in a single chip. This can help rapidly identify bio-matter for health sciences such as diabetes or sweat or urine, blood monitoring. The devices can also be integrated into wearable electronic platforms for personal health monitoring."

Before deposition, LaAlO3 substrates were rinsed by acetone and isopropanol, after which the substrates were dried by nitrogen. Co-sputtering of rare earth and Ni targets were performed with R at a radio frequency (RF) power at 170 W, and Ni at direct current (DC) power at 70 W. This growth condition ensures a stoichiometric ratio of R to Ni cations as characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The growth was carried out at room temperature with a background pressure of argon and oxygen mixture at 5 mTorr. Then the film was annealed at 500\u00b0 C. for 24 hours under 100 bar of O2 in a home-built high-pressure tube furnace. Au electrodes (50 nm thick with 3 nm Ti adhesion layer) were deposited using electron beam evaporation, and the devices were fabricated with shadow masks (500 \u03bcm gap). The GOx enzyme is selective to glucose oxidation while the horseradish enzyme (HRP) can be used to study dopamine release. To anchor the GOx enzyme and HRP enzyme respectively to the Au electrode surface, the SNO devices were first immersed in 10 mM cystamine solution for 2 hours at room temperature in dark. The GOx enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number G6125), HRP enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number P8375) and cystamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. The SNO devices were then rinsed with DI water to remove the unreacted cystamine and dried with compressed air. Next, the glucose oxidase (GOx) was oxidized in order to conjugate to the cystamine on the Au surface. For this purpose, 30 mg sodium metaperiodate was added into 20 \u03bcM GOx solution (in 5 mL 0.1 M pH 6.8 Sodium Phosphate buffer). The mixture was incubated in 4\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Then 6.97 \u03bcL ethylene glycol was added into the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 mins to stop the reaction. This product was purified by PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to collect oxidized GOx as well as changing the buffer back to 0.1 M pH 6.8 Sodium Phosphate. The reacted SNO device was immersed in the collected GOx solution for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. and then rinsed with DI H2O. The device was then dried by compressed air and stored at 4\u00b0 C. ready for use."

                                "As shown in FIG. 1 (a), literature reports on glucose sensing mechanisms can be summarized into four categories: field effect transistor devices, optical methods, direct electron (e\u2212) collection, and electrochemical methods. The field effect transistor devices utilize gate voltage signal from the glucose reaction to modulate the channel conductance for glucose detection. Optical methods were performed by monitoring the optical emission/properties change at certain wavelength that is specific to the glucose reaction. Direct electron collection measures the glucose concentration by directly collecting the electron signal in certain glucose reactions. Electrochemical methods involve cyclic voltammetry to detect the reduction/oxidation peaks of glucose. The glucose detection limit is typically between 10\u22126 to 10\u22128 M, with the highest value being 10\u221212 M for the transistor device, and 2\u00d710\u221215 M for the voltage based electrochemical method with a specially designed reaction cell. The mechanism reported in this work is based on extreme electron localization in SmNiO3 by carrier doping and has a detection limit of \u02dc5\u00d710\u221216 M."

                                "As shown in FIG. 1(b), literature reports on dopamine sensing mechanisms can be summarized into six categories: carbon-based methods, polymer-based methods, aptamer-based methods, catalyst-enhanced methods, molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) based methods and optical sensing. Carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene can be used to detect dopamine through electrical and electrochemical measurements. Polymer based sensors are used due to their biological compatibility. In the Aptamer based methods, short DNA or RNA oligomers are specially designed so that they bind with dopamine for its detection. Catalysts enhanced methods use catalysts to modify electrodes (such as polymer, graphene and carbon fiber etc.), and enhance sensor performance. In the molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) methods, functional monomers first polymerize with template molecules, and then the template molecules are removed. In this way, the detection surface area is increased, and the target molecules bind to the functional sites more preferentially. The optical sensing methods detect local change in optical properties or fluorescence due to the presence of dopamine. The mechanism reported in this work utilizes strong electron correlations induced by hydrogen doping leading to electron localization in SmNiO3 and has a detection limit of \u02dc5\u00d710\u221217 M."
