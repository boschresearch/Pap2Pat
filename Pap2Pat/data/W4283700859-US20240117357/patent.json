                        "Mitochondria are responsible for energy production as well as the synthesis of intermediates used in macromolecular assembly. Accordingly, mitochondria can alter their bioenergetic and biosynthetic function to meet the metabolic demands of the cell or in response to altered physiological environment such as low O2 levels (hypoxia) or nutrient stress. The regulation of metabolism necessitates continuous and effective communication between the mitochondria with the rest of the cell which involves numerous proteins with diverse functions.",
                        "Mitochondria function to meet the high energy demand when cells are subjected to various conditions by providing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Low oxygen levels activate signaling pathways that provide metabolic and adaptive mechanisms to the new environment (1). HIF-1\u03b1 is the primary transcriptional regulator of the cell response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) (2-4). Accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein and its translocation to the cell nucleus leads to the transcriptional activation of several hundred genes that carry a hypoxia response element (HRE) in their promoters (5, 6). This leads to HIF-la-dependent reprogramming of cellular metabolism that shifts the ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation, which is limited under low oxygen levels, to glycolysis (7, 8). There is an important phenomenon (Warburg effect) associated with most cancer cells where glycolysis is predominantly used as the main source of ATP production, even under normal levels of oxygen (normoxia) (9, 10). Accumulating evidence indicates that induced aerobicglycolysis is also important in many cellular processes including embryogenesis, innate and adaptive immunity, type 2 diabetes, starvation, as well as cardiomyopathy (9-15). The role of aerobic glycolysis in these processes is unclear but it provides a swift supply of ATP as well as the building blocks to support many cellular processes and cell growth (16-18). The mechanism that potentially \u201cbypasses\u201d the tight regulation of cellular metabolism by the HIF-1\u03b1 aerobic conditions is also unknown. Under normoxia (aerobic conditions), HIF-1\u03b1 is continuously synthesized and degraded in the cytosol through a highly regulated process that involves the CRL2VHL ligase complex and proteasomal degradation (19, 20). The oxygen sensor propyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) hydroxylates HIF-1\u03b1 which then binds to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein and gets ubiquitinated by the CRL2VHL ligase complex (21).",
                        "MUL1 is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) with its RING finger domain facing the cytoplasm. FIGS. 1A-B. MUL1 participates in various biological pathways involved in mitophagy, apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response. The unique topology of MUL1 enables it to \u201csense\u201d mitochondrial stress in the intermembrane mitochondrial space and convey these signals through the ubiquitination of specific cytoplasmic substrates. FIG. 2A. MUL1 can perform K48- and K63-ubiquitination, as well as SUMOylation FIG. 2B. The instant inventors' study focuses on MUL1's specific K48-ubiquitination of four MUL1 specific substrates, UBXN7, ULK1, Mfn2, and Akt2, that accumulate in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells, which exhibit altered mitochondrial metabolism.",
                        "The instant inventors have identified a novel pathway that operates upstream of the CRL2VHL ligase complex. This pathway originates in the mitochondria and involves the regulation of the UBXN7 cofactor by the mitochondrial MUL1 ligase. MUL1 ubiquitinated UBXN7 and targets it for degradation by the proteosome. FIGS. 3A-C. This allows a tight regulation of UBXN7 protein level that is kept low but sufficient for the normal function of the CRL2VHL ligase complex. If UBXN7 is deregulated, as happens when MUL1 is inactive, the CRL2VHL ligase complex becomes inoperable leading to accumulation of UBXN7 and HIF-1\u03b1, reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, and a metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis under aerobic conditions. Thus, Mul1, through UBXN7, supports a reciprocal regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NRF2 proteins.",
                        "It is becoming abundantly clear that aerobic glycolysis is paramount not only in cancer but also in many biological processes involving proliferating cells as it provides a swift supply of ATP as well as the building blocks to support many cellular processes and cell growth (18). The instant inventors are the first to show this new pathway wherein mitochondria, through MUL1, regulate HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels. The data presented herein show this pathway is very important under normal conditions and is potentially involved in mitochondrial induction of aerobic glycolysis. Considering its involvement in this pathway, MUL1 is a promising target for drug development."

                        "Modulation of MUL1 reveals promising therapeutic options for treatment of various conditions such as obesity and its associated conditions and metabolic syndromes. As discussed, MUL1 is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in various pathophysiological processes including apoptosis, mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response. The studies disclosed herein revealed a new function for MUL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. The metabolic phenotype of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells was characterized using metabolomic, lipidomic, gene expression profiling, metabolic flux, and mitochondrial respiration analyses. In addition, the mechanism by which MUL1 regulates metabolism was investigated. The transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, as well as the serine/threonine kinase Akt2, were identified as the mediators of the MUL1 function. MUL1 ligase, through K48-specific polyubiquitination, regulates both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 protein level and the absence of MUL1 leads to the accumulation and activation of both substrates. Specific chemical inhibitors, and activators of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins, as well as Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells, were used to investigate the individual contribution of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins to the MUL1-specific phenotype. This study describes a new function of MUL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and reveals how its downregulation/inactivation can affect mitochondrial respiration and cause a shift to a new metabolic and lipidomic state. The significance of this pathway is exemplified in animals where MUL1 is inactivated. These animals have a metabolic phenotype, and they are resistant to high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.",

                                "The primary function of mitochondria is to meet the energy demand by providing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); in addition, they have a central role in cellular homeostasis, cell death, and the regulation of metabolism (138; 129; 156). Mitochondria can modify their bioenergetic and biosynthetic function to meet the metabolic demands of the cell, in response to changes in the physiological environment (nutrient stress) or low O2 levels (hypoxia) (134; 146; 135). The regulation of metabolism requires continuous and effective communication between the mitochondria with the rest of the cell which involves numerous proteins with diverse function (160). MUL1 (also known as Mulan, MAPL, GIDE, and HADES), is a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, and one of only three E3 ligases found in mitochondria (the other two are MARCH5 and RNF185) (6; 167; 23; 166; 30; 60; 59; 33). MUL1 is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) with two transmembrane domains, a large intermembrane domain (IMD), and a RING finger domain facing the cytoplasm, which is responsible for its ligase function. Based on its topography, MUL1 can convey changing conditions within the mitochondria to ubiquitinate specific substrates in the cytoplasm. MUL1 is able to K48- or K63-ubiquitinate, as well as SUMOylate a number of specific substrates and its function has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, cell death, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response (167; 23; 168; 59; 37; 39; 25; 26; 22; 169). The studies described herein are focused on the MUL1-mediated K48-polyubiquitination that invariably targets its substrates for proteasomal degradation and therefore regulates their protein level (136). A new function of MUL1 in the regulation of metabolism is described herein. Inactivation of MUL1 ligase has a profound effect on glycolysis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial anaplerotic fluxes, and pyruvate cycling. The mediators of MUL1 function in metabolism, the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, and the serine/threonine kinase Akt2 were characterized. The previous studies have shown that MUL1 can regulate the HIF-1\u03b1 protein to support a glycolytic phenotype in cells (22; 34). In addition, the Akt2 protein, that is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, is also a known substrate of MUL1 (28; 27; 40). Results presented herein show MUL1, through K48 polyubiquitination, co-regulates both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 protein level to maintain a normal metabolic state. Inactivation of MUL1 leads to accumulation and activation of both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins and drives a unique metabolic state that has not been previously characterized. The new function of mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in mitochondrial respiration and the regulation of metabolism has been identified and characterized as described herein. Furthermore, the MUL1 involvement in metabolism mediated by the concurrent regulation of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins has been delineated."

The descriptor C2D23 denotes the resonance of the C2 position that is split into a doublet (D), from coupling to an adjacent 13C label at the C3 position. When a 13C-labeled C2 is flanked by two other neighboring 13C-labeled positions (C1 and C3), the resonance is split twice by the J-coupling into a doublet of doublets, or a quartet (Q), denoted C2Q.

                                "MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates the protein level of several substrates with diverse function. MUL1-mediated K48-polyubiquitination invariably targets its substrates for proteasomal degradation and therefore regulates their protein level. There are four such known substrates: MFN2, ULK1, AKT, as well as the UBXN7 protein that controls the protein level of HIF-1\u03b1 (FIG. 4A). (6; 28; 59; 37; 39; 22). FIG. 4B shows the protein level of UBXN7, HIF-1\u03b1, AKT, ULK1, and MFN2 in two independent clones of HEK293 WT or MUL1(\u2212/\u2212), where MUL1 has been inactivated using CRISPR-Cas9 (152; 159; 209; 22). The absence of MUL1 ligase leads to significant accumulation of all these substrate proteins (FIG. 4C). AKT defines a family of three different but highly homologous kinases, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (137). To determine which one of them is regulated by MUL1, their respective protein level in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells using specific antibodies was monitored. FIG. 4D shows that Akt2 alone is regulated in the absence of MUL1, and there was no detectable change in either Akt1 or Akt3 protein level. In addition, accumulation of Akt2 in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells leads to its activation as seen by the degree of autophosphorylation (P-Akt2 Thr308) as well as the increased phosphorylation of its GSK-313 S9 substrate (FIGS. 4D-E) (141; 143).",
                                "Additionally, to verify that the results were not restricted to HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells alone, a HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cell line was created. FIGS. 4F-G show that in HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells, UBXN7, HIF-1\u03b1, and Akt2 protein levels, as well as their activation reflected in the upregulation of GLUT1 protein and GSK-313 S9 phosphorylation, closely mirror the result observed in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells.",
                                "Furthermore, the instant inventors identified a new substrate of MUL1, the UBXN7 cofactor and scaffold protein of the CRL3KEAP1 and CRL2VHL complexes (FIG. 3C) (34). It was found that inactivation of MUL1 leads to accumulation of UBXN7 which modulates the CRL2VHL complex to increase the stability and activate HIF-1\u03b1 in the absence of hypoxia (22). During the same conditions, accumulation of UBXN7 suppress the NRF2 transcription factor that regulated the CRL3KEAP1 complex. The role of this reciprocal regulation of HIF-la and NRF2 by UBXN7 in the metabolic function of MUL1 is indeterminate. In addition, MUL1 through K48-ubiquitination regulates the protein level of Akt2 kinase alone but has no effect on the other two members of the AKT family, Akt1 and Akt3 (FIGS. 4H-I). The coactivation of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 that occurs in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells has never been observed or studied before.",
                                "Contribution of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 to mitochondrial respiration and the glycolytic phenotype of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. The Glycolytic Stress test was performed using a Seahorse XFe24 analyzer. Glycolysis, glycolytic capacity as well as glycolytic reserve in HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells was monitored. The individual involvement of HIF-la and/or Akt2 proteins, in this process, were investigated using the specific HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, chetomin, or the Akt2 inhibitor, perifosine (140; 158; 109; 142). FIG. 5A compares the glycolytic function, by real-time measurement of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Treatment of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells with perifosine reduced ECAR and glycolysis to a level lower than the one present in HEK293 WT cells (FIGS. 5A-B). Chetomin alone or in combination with perifosine works as a very potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial glycolytic function (FIG. 5A). These results clearly demonstrate that both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins work synergistically and are indispensable for the glycolytic phenotype observed in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. FIG. 5B represents the quantification of the measurements of glycolysis, glycolytic capacity as well as the glycolytic reserve in cells untreated or treated with HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 inhibitors. A mitochondrial respiration assay was also performed and FIG. 5C is a trace of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells untreated or treated with perifosine and/or chetomin. The OCR of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) is lower compared to the HEK293 WT cells and is further reduced after treatment with perifosine, chetomin, or with both inhibitors. FIG. 5D is a quantitative assessment of the data comparing the basal, maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity. In addition, perifosine or chetomin at the concentration used here, are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration and they are very effective against their respective targets of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 (FIG. 5E). Chetomin significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, and perifosine inhibits Akt2 kinase activity (FIGS. 5E-F).",
                                "Regulation of the metabolic flux in HEK293 cells. The effects of MUL1 inactivation and the role of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 accumulation on the metabolic flux using NMR-based 13C-isotopomer analysis was investigated. HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) treated with Akt2 or HIF-la inhibitors and WT cells were labelled using a [U-13C]glucose tracer in the cell culture medium. After multiple turns of the TCA cycle, all carbon positions of the glutamate were labeled, resulting in a complex but well-defined pattern of 13C-NMR spectra (153; 139). A representative 13C-NMR spectrum of glutamate is shown in FIG. 6A demonstrating the 13C-labeling pattern of C-2 and C-4 carbons. The results of the glutamate 13C signal ratio obtained from 13C-NMR spectra of HEK293 WT, MUL1(\u2212/\u2212), MUL1(\u2212/\u2212)+perifosine, and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212)+chetomin are summarized in FIG. 6B. The schematic diagram of the metabolic flux model in FIG. 6C shows the 13C-isotope labeling patterns of the metabolites derived from [U-13C]glucose metabolism after a single turn of the cycle. [U-13C]glucose derived [U-13C]pyruvate produces lactate via LDH and can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through YPC (red arrow) and PDH flux (green arrow). In the first turn of the TCA cycle, [U-13C]pyruvate oxidation through PDH produces labeled glutamate C4-C5 (green dots) positions, whereas YPC flux labels glutamate C2-C3 (red dots). Pyruvate cycling via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and PK fluxes is also shown in FIG. 6C. Pyruvate cycling was included as a possible pathway, as the presence of [1,2-13C2] and [2,3-13C2]lactate isotopomers is only possible via this pathway (FIG. 6A). The relative metabolic flux rates of PK, YPC, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and anaplerosis leading to succinyl-CoA (Ys) were estimated, using glutamate 13C-isotopomer distribution data obtained from 13C-NMR analysis of the cell extracts. All flux rates are referenced to a citrate synthase (CS) flux of 1 and is equivalent to Kreb's cycle flux. Using tcaCALC, multiple different metabolic models can be compared to each other, with the most parsimonious model selected (FIG. 6D) (128). HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells significantly increased the PK and YPC fluxes compared to WT cells and the Akt2 or HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors significantly decreased the PK and YPC flux rates in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells compared to untreated cells (FIG. 6D).",
                                "Additionally, the same metabolic flux analysis using the [U-13C]glucose tracer for HeLa WT and HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells to confirm the effect of MUL1 knock-out on energy metabolism in an alternative cell line was performed. Glutamate isotopomer analysis of HeLa WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells show the same effects of increased pyruvate anaplerosis into the TCA cycle as well as significant flux through PK (FIGS. 6E-F). These results closely mirror those seen in the HEK293 cells.",
                                "Effect of HIF-1\u03b1 activation in the regulation of glycolysis in HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212). HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells using CRISPR-Cas9 (see Methods section) were created in order to investigate the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in glycolysis in the absence of the Akt2 protein. ECAR was measured for both HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and WT cells in the presence or absence of dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG), a known activator of HIF-1\u03b1 (162). HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) had substantially reduced glycolysis compared to MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (FIG. 7A). When HIF-1\u03b1 was activated in HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells, there was a small but significant increase in glycolysis, as well as glycolytic capacity (FIG. 7B). The same treatment in HEK293 WT cells was unremarkable (FIGS. 7A-B). FIG. 7C is Western blot analysis to monitor the protein expression and activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins in HEK293 WT and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells before or after treatment with DMOG. FIG. 7D is a densitometric analysis of the Western blot data from FIG. 7C normalized against \u03b2-actin. The combined data from these experiments strongly suggest that accumulation and activation of both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the glycolytic phenotype observed in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Furthermore, we performed a 13C-NMR-based metabolic flux analysis to determine the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 on metabolism in HEK293 cells by HIF-1\u03b1 activation in the absence of Akt2 protein. The isotopomer results from 13C-NMR spectra of HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212)+DMOG cells are summarized in FIG. 7E. 13C-labeling pattern in glutamate for C2D12 and C2D23 multiplets were significantly different between HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212)+DMOG cells (FIG. 7E). Metabolic flux analysis results suggested that the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 by DMOG significantly increased PK, YPC, and YS fluxes (FIG. 7F).",
                                "The metabolic fluxes of Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells with or without DMOG were also compared with HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells and plotted in FIG. 7G. Akt2 knockout significantly downregulates PK flux compared to HEK293 WT cells. PK flux was partially restored with DMOG, but did not reach the WT levels, while YPC was elevated above WT, but fell short of reaching MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) levels (FIG. 7G). Anaplerosis via succinyl-CoA (Ys) was significantly lower in both Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212)+DMOG cells compared to WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (FIG. 7G). All flux rates are referenced to a citrate synthase (CS) flux of 1 and is equivalent to Kreb's cycle flux.",
                                "The role of MUL1 in the metabolic homeostasis. Detailed global metabolic studies using HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) and WT cells was performed. The unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) 2D scores plots showed clear separation in the metabolic profile between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells in LC-MS positive ion mode (FIG. 8A). Whereas, for LC-MS negative ion mode data, partial separation was achieved between both groups in PCA (FIG. 8D). The supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was used to predict the classes of samples and maximize the separation between groups (FIGS. 8B and 8E). To determine the robustness of the mathematical model, R2 and Q2 parameter values were calculated for the PLS-DA model. The R2/Q2 values for LC-MS positive and negative ion modes data were 0.98/0.70, and 0.90/0.30, respectively (FIGS. 8B and 8E). The PLS-DA variable importance projection (VIP) scores plot from LC-MS positive and negative modes PLS-DA model identified a large group of metabolites different between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (FIGS. 8C and 8F).",
                                "Heatmaps of the top 25 metabolites from both positive and negative mode MS demonstrated excellent clustering of the samples based on MUL1 status (FIGS. 8G-H). Significantly different metabolites were identified by either PLS-DA or T-test, class membership for each sample. The semi-quantitative metabolomics panel from LC-MS positive and negative modes data in FIG. 8I summarized the significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. The metabolites such as \u03b2-alanine, glycerol, glycine, N-acetylglycine, serine, succinate, glutamic acid, isoleucine, thymidine, GABA, and picolinic acid were found significantly higher in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Whereas, N-acetyl-alanine, citrate, trans-aconitate, 3-methylglutaric acid, proline, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 5-amino pentanoate were significantly higher in HEK293 WT cells (FIG. 8I). All significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells were utilized for Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) to produce a network of pathways. MSEA results indicate that the provided metabolites set has significantly enriched the glutamate, arginine, proline, and ammonia recycling metabolic pathways. In addition, glycine, serine, alanine, and propanoate metabolic pathways were also substantially enhanced in the absence of MUL1 (FIGS. 8J-L).",
                                "Alterations in global gene expression and Integrated multi-omics based on the metabolic pathways in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing data comparing HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) gene expression showed that 781 genes were downregulated whereas 822 genes were upregulated in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (FIG. 9A). The heatmap of the top 50 differentially expressed genes show excellent clustering and classification between both groups (FIG. 9B). Functional enrichment analysis of data identified that a large proportion of the regulated genes in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells are important for metabolic processes, including lipid, glucose, retinoic acid, carbohydrate and glutathione metabolism. This analysis indicated that deletion of MUL1 upregulates a group of genes including: CYP2E1, FABP6, PNPLA1, ACSBG1, AKR1C3, AKR1C1, and PIP5K1C that are involved in lipid transport, prostaglandin, progesterone, triglyceride and retinoic acid metabolic process. In addition, GPX4, PLCB2, PLPP4, PLPPR3, FADS1, FADS2, GSTP1 and GSTM2, genes involved in phospholipid and linoleic acid metabolic process were downregulated. Genes involved in glucose and pyruvate metabolism (IGF2, TNF, DCXR, ONECUT1, LDHC and PCK2) were also downregulated. A heatmap highlighting genes that are involved in the lipid, glucose, carbohydrate, glutathione, and retinoic acid metabolism, is shown in FIG. 9C. To take advantage of multi-omics datasets of HEK293 cells, a joint pathway analysis, employing the fold change values of the metabolites and genes in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells as compared to WT control cells, was conducted. The results from joint pathway analysis depicted in FIG. 9D indicate that glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid (linoleic acid) metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and retinol metabolism were significantly interrupted in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells.",
                                "Perturbation in the lipid profile of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. To monitor changes in the lipid profile LC-MS analysis was performed on HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. The profiling of various lipid classes such as triglycerides (TGs), diacylglycerols (DGs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and ceramides strong changes in lipid metabolism enforced by the MUL1 knockout. The lipidomic profiling data demonstrated that the TGs and DGs are significantly higher in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells but there was no notable difference found for PCs, PEs, and ceramides (FIG. 10A). To provide more insight into lipid profiling of each lipid class, the 10 most abundant TGs, DGs, PCs, PEs, and ceramides were analyzed. TGs such as TG(16:0_16:0_18:1), TG(16:0_18:1_18:1), TG(14:0_16:0_18:0), TG(16:0_18:0_18:1), and TG(16:0_16:0_18:1) as well as DGs species i.e., DG(16:0_18:1), DG(18:1_18:1), and DG(18:1_18:2) were found significantly higher in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) (FIGS. 10B-C). PC(14:0_16:0) and PC(14:0_16:1) and PE(18:0_20:4), and PE(18:0_18:1) were significantly lower in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells whereas, PE(16:1_18:0) was found higher in WT cells (FIGS. 10D-E). Ceramide species such as CerNS(d18:1/24:1) and CerNS(d18:1/20:0) were significantly higher in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (FIG. 10F). Lipid Ontology (LION) enrichment analysis was carried out for annotation of lipids in untargeted lipidomic analysis. The results shown in FIG. 10G suggest that the most important components such as lipid storage, triglycerides, headgroup with a neutral charge, glycerolipids, fatty acids with 18 carbons, and C18:1 chain length were significantly upregulated in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Lipids of membrane component, headgroup with a positive charge, glycerophospholipids, lipids of endoplasmic reticulum, lysoglycerophospholipids, glycerophosphocholines, and glycerophosphoethanolamines were significantly lower in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells."

                                "Metabolic reprogramming is the hallmark of cancer, but healthy mammalian cells can also modulate their metabolic state in response to fast growth demand or due to various conditions that adversely affect oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), such as hypoxia (131; 133; 157). Metabolic regulation involves the coordinate function of numerous proteins located in different subcellular compartments including mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Mitochondria continuously communicate their current bioenergetic and biosynthetic state to the rest of the cell through various signaling pathways and they can alter their function to accommodate changing metabolic demands (148). One of the many ways by which mitochondria communicate is through signaling proteins located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). As noted, the studies described herein are focused on one such protein, the mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its potential role in the regulation of metabolism. MUL1 is located in the OMM and its function has been implicated in mitophagy, cell death, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response (167; 168; 37; 152; 26; 209; 22). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MUL1 interacts with various E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes to ubiquitinate specific substrates (60). MUL1 can perform two types of ubiquitination where either the lysine 48 (K48) or the lysine 63 (K63) of the ubiquitin is involved in the isopeptide linkage (136; 144). In addition, MUL1 can function as a SUMO E3 ligase to attach SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) onto specific substrates (23; 25; 171). In the studies described herein, MUL1's K48-ubiquitination that invariably targets substrates for proteasomal degradation was investigated. At least four substrates are regulated and accumulate in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells: ULK1, MFN2, HIF-1\u03b1, and Akt2 proteins (FIGS. 4A-E)) (28; 39; 132; 22). The studies described herein focused on Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 coregulation by MUL1 since activation of these proteins is involved with metabolic phenotypes that favors glycolysis, a hallmark of cancer cells refers to as the Warburg effect (Lu et al., 2002; Pavlides et al., 2009). It was found that inactivation of MUL1 leads to suppression of OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. In addition, steady state flux rates show increased activity of YPC and PK flux in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. These metabolic changes can be reversed by specific Akt2 or HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors. Furthermore, data presented herein indicate that the metabolic phenotype of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells is distinct from the glycolytic state observed in cancer cells (Warburg effect), where increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) switch OXPHOS to glycolysis (150; 84). Detailed metabolomics analyses of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells, that clearly shows MUL1 has a very important role in both metabolic and lipidomic regulation, was performed. Detailed metabolomic and genomic analyses, using HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells, was employed to investigate the state of metabolic pathways. The results demonstrate there are significant differences in the metabolites and the gene expression profiles between these two cell lines. The multi-omics approach identified a number of metabolic pathways that were perturbed in the absence of MUL1. These include glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and retinol metabolism. Lipidomic analysis showed significant accumulation of neutral head groups containing lipids such as triglycerides and diacylglycerides in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. The overall levels of other lipid species such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and ceramides were unaffected by MUL1 inactivation in HEK293 cells. FIG. 11 summarizes the proposed MUL1's function and pathway in the regulation of metabolism based on the data presented here.",
                                "The multifaceted analysis shows that MUL1 is involved in the regulation of metabolism and its inactivation/downregulation can lead to a distinct metabolic state not previously described. MUL1 protein level is known to be regulated but the mechanism(s) is not fully characterized. Previous studies of the instant inventor's identified Omi/HtrA2, a serine protease located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), as a major regulator of MUL1 protein level (59). Omi/HtrA2 has a role in protein quality control within the IMS, and its activity is modulated by oxidative stress, the HAX1 protein, as well as by the NDUFA13 subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (175; 77; 102; 100; 103; 101). In addition, K48-autoubiquitination of MUL1 is another potential mechanism that can target the ligase for degradation and regulate its protein level (39; 199).",
                                "Besides the involvement of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 in the regulation of metabolism by MUL1, the participation of other MUL1-substrate proteins, such as the MFN2 and ULK1 proteins, cannot be excluded. Besides Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1, accumulation of MFN2 and ULK1 is also observed in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. In addition, MFN2 has been implicated in the regulation of metabolism in cancer cells and shown to interacts with PKM2 (149; 84). ULK1 plays a major role in autophagy but can also phosphorylate key glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), enolase 1 (ENO1), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), in response to nutritional deprivation (79). This dual parallel function of ULK1 can sustain the activity of multiple glycolytic enzymes and support metabolic homeostasis during amino acid and growth factor deprivation (79). In the studies described herein, specific inhibitors were used to establish that Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 are the main \u201cdrivers\u201d of the MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) metabolic phenotype; any potential role MFN2 and/or ULK1 might have in this process will be downstream of these two proteins."

The next step in this study is development of insight into the targets of MUL1 in vivo and to assess the downstream effects on metabolism. Mice that carry a global inactivation of MUL1 will be used in this next step. These animals have a metabolic phenotype, and the preliminary data show they are resistant to HFD-induced obesity (and associated metabolic systems), fatty liver, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance (FIGS. 18A-H). These mice also have a very high rate of oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism.

The HFD mouse is characterized by increasing obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, fatty acid deposition in the liver, and increased liver inflammation, among other phenotypical changes (108). Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and WT mice were placed on a high fat diet (HFD 60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) for 16 weeks to induce obesity.",

                                "The primary function of mitochondrial metabolism is to provide ATP, through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to support the energy demand of the cells [163,164]. In addition, mitochondria play a major role in the biosynthesis of precursors used for macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA. These bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions of mitochondria are regulated and adjusted in response to changes in the physiological environment [165]. The regulation of mitochondrial metabolism involves numerous proteins with diverse functions as well as effective communication between mitochondria with the rest of the cell. MUL1 (also known as Mulan, MAPL, GIDE, and HADES) is one of three mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligases, the other two being MARCH, and RNF185 [23,166,24,30,167]. MUL1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and its function has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, cell death, mitochondrial dynamics, innate immune response, and very recently mitochondrial metabolism [168,25, 26,169,170,59]. MUL1 can perform K48- and K63-ubiquitination, as well as SUMOylation targeting specific substrates located in the OMM or in the vicinity of mitochondria [22,25,26,171-173].",
                                "In Study One, using human cell lines, a unique function of MUL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis [22,34,59,60,174,175] was uncovered. In Study Two, the phenotype of mice carrying a whole-body inactivation of the Mul1 gene was investigated. Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals, fed a standard diet (ND), are slightly smaller and leaner than, wildtype animals, but developmentally normal and exhibit features of impaired metabolomic and lipidomic function. Using metabolic cages, the whole-body energy expenditure and metabolism of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice was monitored and shown to be different than their Mul1(+/+) littermates. In addition, when the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) they exhibited increased oxygen consumption (higher metabolic rate), robust resistance to HFD-induced obesity, and intact thermoregulation upon cold challenge. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses as well as Genome-wide mRNA sequencing of the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD, identified several metabolic enzymes involved in lipogenesis and b-oxidation that are differentially regulated in the absence of MUL1. One of these enzymes, markedly downregulated in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD, is the Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) protein. SCD1 is a widely studied enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Animals with a targeted disruption of Scd1 gene have a phenotype that closely resembles the corresponding phenotype of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice [177-181]. This includes resistance to HFD, reduced fatty acid synthesis, and increased energy expenditure. In addition, several enzymes, that have previously been shown to be dysregulated in the absence of SCD1, such as phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), were also affected in a similar manner in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals on HFD. These results suggest that mitochondrial MUL1 ligase is an important regulator of lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation especially during HFD conditions. Mul1 inactivation downregulates the expression of Scd1 gene and inhibits SCD1 protein induction, that normally occurs by HFD, in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT). Consequently, Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice are characterized by high metabolic rate, thinness, and resistance to HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic syndrome. This data supports a new role for MUL1 ligase as an important metabolic regulator of lipogenesis and \u03b2-oxidation. It is proposed that this new function of MUL1 is mediated primarily through the regulation of SCD1 and other key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and \u03b2-oxidation. Furthermore, these studies advocate that MUL1 ubiquitin ligase is a promising target in the development of therapeutic interventions for obesity and associated metabolic disease.",

The effect of Mul1 inactivation on body weight, HFD-induced adiposity, fatty liver, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance was examined. Global metabolomics, lipidomic, and genome-wide mRNA sequencing using liver from Mul1(+/+) and Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals on HFD was performed.

After this time Mul1(+/+) animals exhibited all the symptoms of HFD-induced obesity including a significant increase in body weight (FIGS. 19A-B). On the contrary, Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals showed resistance to HFD-induced obesity with very little increase in body weight (FIG. 19B). This effect was manifested in both male and female animals (FIG. 19A-B). Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance was also monitored in both Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1(+/+) animals on HFD. FIGS. 19C-D show that Mul1(+/+) animals exhibited glucose intolerance, after a glucose load, that is typically associated with obesity and reduced sensitivity to insulin. Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals had improved glucose tolerance and better insulin sensitivity compared to their Mul1(+/+) littermates. In addition, Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice displayed a marked reduction in adiposity throughout iWAT, sWAT, and mWAT shown in the representative images in FIG. 19E. Since hepatic steatosis is a key feature of obesity, liver samples obtained from Mul1(+/+) and Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals and stained with H&E were compared. FIG. 19F (top panel) shows Mul1(+/+) mice exhibit clear signs of steatosis characterized by hepatocyte ballooning and accumulation of vacuoles. This steatosis phenotype was absent in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals. In addition, Oil Red O staining of liver tissue shows that Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice have marked reduction in lipid accumulation compared to Mul1(+/+) animals (FIG. 19F, lower panel).",

Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on ND exhibited an increased rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) as well as energy expenditure compared to Mul1(+/+) animals (FIGS. 28A-D). This difference in oxygen consumption was even more pronounced when animals were maintained on the HFD (FIGS. 20A-B). There was also increased energy expenditure of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals during the feeding phase (dark cycle) indicating their preference for lipids as an energy source over carbohydrates (FIGS. 20C-D). Additionally, Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice had significantly higher food consumption (FIG. 20E), and high activity locomotion (FIG. 20F). FIG. 20G shows the body weight of the animals at the start (bars 1 and 3) or the end (bars 2 and 4) of the experiment (n=5).",

The two groups of animals were kept at the ambient temperature of 22\u00b0 C. for 48 hours and then exposed to acute cold-challenged for another 48 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Under these conditions, the oxygen consumption rate (FIGS. 21A-B), the respiratory exchange ratio (FIGS. 21C-D), and the energy expenditure (FIGS. 21E-F) were similar between the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1 (+/+) mice. Additionally, the body temperature of the animals kept at 4\u00b0 C. for up to 10 hours was monitored. Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals had intact thermoregulation and were able to cold-adapt with no significant difference compared Mul1(+/+) (FIG. 21G). Consistent with these observations, there was no detectable change in the expression of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) between Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1(+/+) animals, following the cold challenge (FIG. 21H). FIG. 21I shows the average weight of the animals before and after the cold challenge (n=4).",

The unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) scores plots show clear separation in the metabolic profile between Mul1(+/+) and Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver in LC-MS positive ion mode (FIGS. 22A-B). The supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was used to predict the classes of samples and maximize the separation between groups. The PLS-DA variable importance projection (VIP) scores plot from LC-MS positive mode identified a large group of metabolites that showed differences between Mul1(+/+) and Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver (FIG. 22C). The VIP scores plot identified metabolites such as acetylcitrulline, a-aminoadipate, propanoylcarnitine, adenine, D-glucosamine, cytosine, and guanidinoacetate, which were found to be significantly higher in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) on HFD. Whereas, lactic acid, hippurate, 6C sugar alcohol, and glycerol 3-phosphate were lower in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) liver. Similarly, LC-MS negative mode data also showed separation in PCA and PLS-DA models (FIGS. 22D-E). The PLS-DA VIP scores plot showed that the metabolites such as pyruvate, malate, histidine, xanthine, tryptophan were found higher in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver than Mul1(+/+). Metabolites such as glutathione, sucrose, raffinose, and glycerol 2-phosphate were found higher in Mul1(+/+) (FIG. 22F). The semiquantitative readouts of the metabolite levels demonstrate that large numbers of significantly different metabolites that drive the PLS-DA classifications (FIGS. 22G-H).",

As expected, the total lipid content and triglycerides were found to be significantly higher in the liver of Mul1(+/+) than Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD. Total diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and ceramides were not significantly different between the two groups of animals (FIG. 23A). Nine of the top 10 triglycerides by abundance were significantly different between both groups, and higher in Mul1(+/+) HFD-liver (FIG. 23B). DG (16:0_22:6) and DG (18:1_20:3) were significantly higher in Mul1(+/+) HFD-liver than Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver (FIG. 23C). Other classes of lipids showed fewer significant differences (FIGS. 23D-F). LION term enrichment analysis of Mul1(+/+) versus Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) liver summarized the changes in lipid entities in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver (FIG. 23G). Glycerophosphoglycerols, glycerophospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids (C22-C24) were significantly higher in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver (FIG. 24C). The joint-metabolic pathway analysis also showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is significantly altered in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver. The lipids containing neutral head groups, triglycerides, lipid storage, and glycerolipids were found to be significantly lower in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver. The lipidomic analysis indicates that MUL1 inactivation causes a massive change in lipid metabolism even with the supplementation of HFD diet. FIG. 23B clearly indicates that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acyl containing triglycerides are significantly lower in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver. FIG. 23G shows that monounsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, lipid droplets, and lipid storage as integrated pathways were downregulated in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver including palmitoleate and oleate, products of SCD1 activity. Additionally, PCA and PLS-DA analysis as well as clustered-heatmap clearly showed the separation in the overall lipid profiles between Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1(+/+) HFD-liver (FIGS. 29A-B and FIG. 28C).",

The heatmap in FIG. 24A highlights genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, and metabolism that were significantly downregulated in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD. The few genes unregulated are involved in mitochondrial function and include the mitochondrial cardiolipin synthase 1 (CRLS1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1 (PTPMT1). Both proteins are involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin (CL) and CRLS1 overexpression has been previously shown to ameliorate, lipid accumulation, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance [191]. There is also increased expression of Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D Synthase (HPGDS) involved in prostaglandin synthesis and immune response [192]. In addition, there is upregulation of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6 (NDUFS6), and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 (NDUFAB1) which are both components of the respiratory chain Complex I, involved in the electron transport. The top four ranked differentially regulated genes are shown in FIG. 24B and represent enzymes with diverse metabolic function. Trefoil factor 3 (Tff3), a small mainly secreted peptide, which when overexpressed in liver has been shown to increase fatty acid oxidation and inhibit gluconeogenesis [193,194]. Asparagine synthetase (Asns), a cytoplasmic enzyme that generates asparagine from aspartate. Cyp2a4, a member of the mammalian Cytochrome P450 (Cyp) gene superfamily that participates in a wide range of metabolic processes in the liver. And finally, Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) which controls the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) from their saturated fatty acid (SFA) precursors, introducing a cis-double bond at the 49 position to stearoyl (C18:0) and palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0). SCD1 is a key regulator in lipid metabolism; high expression of SCD1 protein correlates with obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis and inactivation of SCD1 supports an HFD-resistant phenotype, reduced fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity [178,195-198]. These studies are focused on SCD1 as the potential mediator of MUL1 function in lipid metabolism since SCD1 is strongly downregulated in the absence of MUL1 and that the Scd1(\u2212/\u2212) mouse phenotype closely resembles that of the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals [178-181]. In addition, a joint metabolic pathway analysis using uniport protein ID and HMDB ID of genes and metabolites, respectively, was performed. The fold change of genes and metabolite levels between the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1(+/+) HFD-liver were used as an input to create an integrative metabolic pathway analysis. (FIG. 24C). The results from joint pathway analysis depicted in FIG. 24B indicate that glycerolipids, glycerophospholipid, fatty acid metabolism, and alanine-aspartate-glutamate metabolism, were significantly affected in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD liver.",
                                "Expression and regulation of SCD1 pathway in lipogenesis in the absence of Mul1\u2014The protein expression level of various enzymes that are known to be involved in the SCD1 pathway and the regulation of lipogenesis and b-oxidation was investigated. FIG. 25A shows that there was no significant difference in the expression of SCD1 in the sWAT from Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice maintained on a ND. However, there is a significant induction of SCD1 in Mul1(+/+) animals on HFD and this induction is inhibited in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) under the same conditions. In the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) liver there is a significant SCD1 downregulation in both ND and HFD compared to Mul1(+/+) animals (FIG. 25B). Expression of MUL1 and SCD1 is induced by HFD in the sWAT and liver of Mul1(+/+) mice (FIGS. 25A-B). FIG. 25C is a graph representation of densitometric analysis of the proteins from FIGS. 25A-B normalized against b-actin. CPT1 protein increased with HFD in both groups but Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice expressed higher level of the protein (FIGS. 25D-E). AMPK protein level is not affected by the diet or presence of MUL1, however the phospho-AMPK (pAMPK) which represents the active form of the enzyme, is substantially higher in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD (FIGS. 25D-E). FASN, ACC1 and its phosphorylated form pACC1 are also strongly induced with HFD and this induction is completely absent in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) HFD-liver (FIGS. 25F-G). HSP90 protein expression was used as a loading control (FIG. 25F). The pattern of expression of all these proteins during ND or HFD suggests that MUL1 is upstream of SCD1. Furthermore, the regulation of this pathway in the absence of MUL1 occurs primary during HFD. This result suggests a unique function for MUL1 in lipogenesis and metabolism during conditions of nutritional overload such as in HFD."

                                "MUL1 is a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase due to its exclusive localization in the outer mitochondrial membrane and its ability to modify specific substrates through SUMOylation, as well as K63- or K48-ubiquitination [23,25,26,40,199]. In addition, MUL1 has a large intermembrane domain (IMD) that can act as a sensor of various conditions in the mitochondria and modulate its ligase activity against various substrates [24,167]. The IMD of MUL1 is also the target of mitochondrial protease Omi/HtrA2 that is involved in protein quality control and can regulate MUL1 protein levels during mitochondrial stress. [22,174]. The studies disclosed herein, using established human cell lines, indicated that the absence of MUL1 protein expression could support a unique metabolic phenotype [174].",
                                "The function of mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of lipid metabolism under conditions of nutritional overload in the form of a high fat diet was investigated. It was found that animals with whole body Mul1 inactivation are resistant to HFD-induced obesity, liver steatosis, insulin insensitivity, and glucose intolerance. In addition, Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals have a hypermetabolic phenotype, significantly higher oxygen consumption, and energy expenditure but an intact thermoregulation when compared to their Mul1(+/+) littermates. Through metabolomic and lipidomic studies of mouse livers from Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mul1(+/+) animals on HFD, several clusters of genes involved in both fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis were identified to be differentially expressed. One of the top genes, whose mRNA expression is dramatically downregulated in the absence of MUL1, was SCD1. SCD1 protein is located exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is anchored through four transmembrane domains and exposing both catalytic amino and carboxy-terminal domains to the cytoplasm [200]. SCD1 is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) from palmitate and stearate, their saturated fatty acids (SFA) precursors [180,197,201]. A plethora of previous studies have established SCD1 as a key regulator in lipid metabolism; high expression of SCD1 protein correlates with obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis and inactivation of Scd1 gene supports an HFD-resistant phenotype, reduced fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity [178-181]. The studies disclosed herein are focused on SCD1 enzyme as a potential downstream mediator of MUL1's function in lipogenesis since mice with SCD1 inactivation have a phenotype that closely resembles that of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals. This phenotype includes increased fatty acid oxidation, attenuated lipid accumulation, and resistance to HFD-induced obesity [202-204]. SCD1 is expressed predominantly in the liver and white adipose tissue, where its protein expression is induced by HFD. In Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice the SCD1 expression in adipose tissue and liver is markedly downregulated particularly during HFD conditions. Since Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals have increased \u03b2-oxidation and reduced lipogenesis, the expression of key enzymes involved in both processes was monitored. It was found that MUL1 deficiency activates AMPK by increasing its phosphorylation (pAMPK), which in turn drives a cascade of reactions involved in cellular energy homeostasis. pAMPK promotes the expression and accumulation of its downstream target CPT1, that is in the OMM, and facilitates the import of fatty acids to drive b-oxidation [202]. In addition, activation of pAMPK in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice leads to the downregulation ACC1 and FASN, enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Most of these enzymes have also been shown to be regulated in a similar manner in the liver of the Scd1(\u2212/\u2212) animals [202,205,206]. FIG. 26 is a schematic diagram of the proposed MUL1-regulated pathway in lipogenesis and b-oxidation in the liver of mice on HFD. It is interesting to note that the absence of MUL1 function does not affect the expression of all these proteins in the liver of animals fed a regular chow diet, but it has a dramatic effect in reducing their expression or induction that is associated with HFD. The data suggests that Scd1 gene is the main mediator of MUL1's function in lipogenesis and acts as a modulator of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis especially during conditions of nutritional overload in the form of HFD. There are several other proteins regulated in the liver of Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice on HFD, that could potentially play a supporting role in the metabolic phenotype of these mice. These proteins might be downstream targets of SCD1, or they could be regulated directly in the absence of Mul1. The mechanism by which MUL1 inactivation suppresses the expression of SCD1 in liver and fat tissue, especially under conditions of HFD, is unclear. The mRNA sequencing identified Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP1) and Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) transcriptional activators involved in Scd1 transcriptional control [207,208] to be down regulated in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) animals. MUL1 protein is expressed ubiquitously, and the mice used herein carry a whole-body inactivation of Mul1 gene. Since the effect of MUL1 in the regulation of SCD1 was seen primarily in the liver and sWAT, it will be of interest to investigate if liver and/or fat tissue specific Mul1 deletion alone can replicate a similar metabolic phenotype. In addition, it is possible MUL1 has different tissue specific functions beyond its role in lipogenesis in liver and sWAT. The biological function of MUL1 in mitochondrial dynamics and more specifically in mitophagy has been often compared with that of Parkin. Both MUL1 and Parkin are E3 ubiquitin ligases, MUL1 is mito-resident whereas Parkin is mito-recruited. Several reports have shown MUL1 can work in parallel or in synergy, independent, or opposite, to Parkin's role in mitophagy [37,209-211], The study described herein indicates that the similarities between MUL1 and Parkin function also extend in the regulation of adiposity. Recent studies have shown Parkin inactivation in the adipose tissue alleviates HFD-induced obesity as well as aging-induced adiposity in mice [212.213]. The study described herein demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms of MUL1 function in lipogenesis is different from the one reported for Parkin [213]. It will be of interest to investigate if there is any crosstalk between these two E3 ligases or if they work independently to regulate lipogenesis. In summary, the study described herein establishes a new function for mitochondrial MUL1 E3-ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, particularly during conditions of HFD. The data also suggests that MUL1 can be a very promising target for the development of chemical molecule inhibitors or therapeutic siRNA that could be used against obesity and the accompanying metabolic disease."

                        "The instant inventors have identified a new molecular pathway, mediated by the MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, that regulates mitochondrial metabolism. MUL1 is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various biological pathways, including mitochondrial dynamics, apoptosis, and innate immune response. It was discovered that MUL1 can regulate HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels under aerobic conditions. Inactivation of MUL1 causes accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1, as well as Akt2, ULK1, and Mfn2 proteins, which are known to be involved in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. MUL1 inactivation causes a metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis, a phenotype resembling the Warburg effect, a phenomenon associated with most cancer cells where glycolysis is predominantly used as the main source of ATP production. Recent studies suggest that aerobic glycolysis is not only the hallmark of cancer, but it is also involved in many physiological functions. These include embryogenesis, stem cell differentiation, innate and adaptive immunity, type 2 diabetes, starvation, as well as cardiomyopathy. Mice carrying a global inactivation of the Mul1 gene have a very distinct metabolic phenotype and they are resistant to HFD-induced obesity. The regulation of mitochondrial metabolism by MUL1, especially its role in fat oxidation and obesity has not been previously investigated, which is the primary focus of these studies. It is thought that loss of MUL1 alters mitochondrial dynamics, electron transport and oxidative metabolism. Therefore, the respective mechanism and contribution of HIF-1\u03b1, Akt2, ULK1, and Mfn2 proteins to the MUL1 mediated metabolic phenotype have been investigated. In addition, the obesity resistant phenotype of the Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice has been investigated in detail using animals fed with either regular chow or HFD. Whole body metabolism was monitored using the \u201cPromethion\u201d metabolic cages system\u201d and state-of-the-art techniques including global LC-MS metabolomics, lipidomic, mRNA sequencing, and isotope-based flux measurements, all of which are sensitive to modified glycolysis and TCA turnover in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice. In addition, temperature homeostasis, in Mul1(\u2212/\u2212) mice was studied to verify if the mice can maintain optimal body temperature (37\u00b0 C.) when exposed to acute (4\u00b0 C.) and or gradual cold challenge, a condition that requires close functional coordination between thermogenic and metabolic organs.",
                        "A combination of approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a new pathway that drives mitochondrial metabolism and makes the knockout mouse resistant to HFD-induced obesity were used in the studies described herein. The role of the several key proteins in this pathway were characterized and the involvement of mitochondria dynamics was monitored. A new function of the mitochondrial Mul1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of lipogenesis and adiposity, particularly during conditions of a high fat diet (HFD), was identified. Inactivation of Mul1 provides resistance to HFD-induced obesity and can be a therapeutic target for treatment of obesity. It is contemplated that these studies could lead to the development of pharmacological inhibitors of MUL1 ligase for prevention and treatment of obesity in humans, providing protection against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes, heart or kidney disease, stroke, and certain kinds of cancers.",
