    "title": "Regulation of Metabolism by Mitochondrial MUL1 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase",
    "date": "2022-06-29",
    "abstract": "MUL1 is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in various pathophysiological processes including apoptosis, mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response. We uncovered a new function for MUL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. We characterized the metabolic phenotype of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells using metabolomic, lipidomic, gene expression profiling, metabolic flux, and mitochondrial respiration analyses. In addition, the mechanism by which MUL1 regulates metabolism was investigated, and the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, as well as the serine/threonine kinase Akt2, were identified as the mediators of the MUL1 function. MUL1 ligase, through K48-specific polyubiquitination, regulates both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 protein level, and the absence of MUL1 leads to the accumulation and activation of both substrates. We used specific chemical inhibitors and activators of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins, as well as Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells, to investigate the individual contribution of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins to the MUL1-specific phenotype. This study describes a new function of MUL1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and reveals how its downregulation/inactivation can affect mitochondrial respiration and cause a shift to a new metabolic and lipidomic state.",

                "The primary function of mitochondria is to meet the energy demand by providing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); in addition, they have a central role in cellular homeostasis, cell death, and the regulation of metabolism (Herst et al., 2017; Annesley and Fisher, 2019; Rossmann et al., 2021). Mitochondria can modify their bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions to meet the metabolic demands of the cell, in response to changes in the physiological environment (nutrient stress) or low O2 levels (hypoxia) (Fuhrmann and Brune, 2017; McElroy and Chandel, 2017; Glancy et al., 2020). The regulation of metabolism requires continuous and effective communication between the mitochondria with the rest of the cell, which involves numerous proteins with diverse functions (Weinberg and Chandel, 2015). MUL1 (also known as Mulan, MAPL, GIDE, and HADES) is a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase and one of only three E3 ligases found in mitochondria (the other two are MARCH5 and RNF185) (Li et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Braschi et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2011; Ambivero et al., 2014; Cilenti et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016). MUL1 is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) with two transmembrane domains, a large intermembrane domain (IMD), and a RING finger domain facing the cytoplasm, which is responsible for its ligase function. Based on its topography, MUL1 can convey changing conditions within the mitochondria to ubiquitinate specific substrates in the cytoplasm. MUL1 is able to K48- or K63-ubiquitinate, as well as SUMOylate, a number of specific substrates and its function has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, cell death, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response (Zhang et al., 2008; Braschi et al., 2009; Jenkins et al., 2013; Cilenti et al., 2014; Yun et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Prudent et al., 2015; Ni et al., 2017; Cilenti et al., 2020; Puri et al., 2020). We have previously shown that MUL1 through UBXN7 can regulate the HIF-1\u03b1 protein level to support a glycolytic phenotype in cells (Cilenti et al., 2020; Di Gregorio et al., 2021). In addition, the AKT protein, which is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, is also a known substrate of MUL1 (Bae et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017). Here, we show that MUL1, through K48 polyubiquitination, co-regulates both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 protein level to maintain a normal metabolic state. Inactivation of MUL1 leads to the accumulation of both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins and has a profound effect on glycolysis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial anaplerotic fluxes, and pyruvate cycling and defines a unique metabolic state. In summary, we identified and characterized a new function of mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in mitochondrial respiration and the regulation of metabolism. Furthermore, we delineated that the MUL1 involvement in metabolism is mediated by the concurrent regulation of Akt2 kinase and HIF-1\u03b1 transcription factor."

A quantitative metabolomic panel of significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells was created, employing statistical analysis via t-test in MetaboAnalyst (Chong et al., 2019). Box-and-whisker plots were prepared in GraphPad prism, which displayed the differential level of significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells."

                        "MUL1-mediated K48 polyubiquitination invariably targets its substrates for proteasomal degradation and therefore regulates their protein level. There are four such known substrates: MFN2, ULK1, AKT, and the UBXN7 protein that controls the protein level of HIF-1\u03b1 (Figure 1A) (Li et al., 2008; Bae et al., 2012; Cilenti et al., 2014; Yun et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Cilenti et al., 2020). Figure 1B shows the protein level of UBXN7, HIF-1\u03b1, AKT, ULK1, and MFN2 in two independent clones of HEK293 WT or MUL1(\u2212/\u2212), where MUL1 has been inactivated using CRISPR-Cas9 (Peng et al., 2016; Steffen et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2019; Cilenti et al., 2020). The absence of MUL1 ligase leads to the significant accumulation of all these substrate proteins (Figure 1C). AKT defines a family of three different but highly homologous kinases, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (Gonzalez and McGraw, 2009). To determine which one of them is regulated by MUL1, we monitored their respective protein level in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells using specific antibodies. Figure 1D shows that Akt2 alone is regulated in the absence of MUL1, and there was no detectable change in either Akt1 or Akt3 protein level. In addition, the accumulation of Akt2 in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells leads to its activation, as seen by the degree of autophosphorylation (P-Akt2 Thr308) as well as the increased phosphorylation of its GSK-3\u03b2 S9 substrate (Figures 1D,E) (Kuo et al., 2008; Le Grand et al., 2014). To verify that our results were not restricted to HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells alone, we created a HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cell line. Supplementary Figures S1A, B show that in HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells, UBXN7, HIF-1\u03b1, and Akt2 protein levels, as well as their activation reflected in the upregulation of GLUT1 protein and GSK-3\u03b2 S9 phosphorylation, closely mirror the result observed in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells."

Glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve in HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells were monitored. The individual involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and/or Akt2 proteins, in this process, was investigated using a specific HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, chetomin, or an Akt2 inhibitor, perifosine (Kung et al., 2004; Staab et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Le Grand et al., 2017). Figure 2A compares the glycolytic function by the real-time measurement of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Treatment of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells with perifosine reduced ECAR and glycolysis to a level lower than that present in HEK293 WT cells (Figures 2A,B). Chetomin alone or in combination with perifosine works as a very potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial glycolytic function (Figure 2A). These results clearly demonstrate that both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins work synergistically and are indispensable for the glycolytic phenotype observed in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Figure 2B represents the quantification of the measurements of glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and the glycolytic reserve in cells untreated or treated with HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 inhibitors. We also performed a mitochondrial respiration assay, and Figure 2C shows the trace of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells untreated or treated with perifosine and/or chetomin. The OCR of HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) is lower compared to that of the HEK293 WT cells and is further reduced after treatment with perifosine, chetomin, or with both inhibitors. Figure 2D shows the quantitative assessment of the data comparing the basal, maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity. In addition, perifosine and chetomin at the concentration used here are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration and they are very effective against their respective targets of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 (Figure 2E). Chetomin significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, and perifosine inhibits Akt2 kinase activity (Figures 2E,F)."

HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) treated with Akt2 or HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors and WT cells were labeled using a [U-13C]glucose tracer in the cell culture medium. After multiple turns of the TCA cycle, all carbon positions of the glutamate were labeled, resulting in a complex but well-defined pattern of 13C-NMR spectra (Purmal et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2016). A representative 13C-NMR spectrum of glutamate is shown in Figure 3A demonstrating the 13C-labeling pattern of C-2 and C-4 carbons. The results of the glutamate 13C signal ratio obtained from 13C-NMR spectra of HEK293 WT, MUL1(\u2212/\u2212), MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) + perifosine, and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) + chetomin are summarized in Figure 3B. The schematic diagram of the metabolic flux model in Figure 3C shows the 13C-isotope labeling patterns of the metabolites derived from the [U-13C]glucose metabolism after a single turn of the cycle [U-13C]glucose-derived [U-13C]pyruvate produces lactate via LDH and can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through YPC (red arrow) and PDH flux (green arrow). In the first turn of the TCA cycle, the [U-13C]pyruvate oxidation through PDH produces labeled glutamate C4\u2013C5 (green dots) positions, whereas YPC flux labels glutamate C2\u2013C3 (red dots). Pyruvate cycling via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and PK fluxes is also shown in Figure 3C. Pyruvate cycling was included as a possible pathway, as the presence of [1,2\u201313C2] and [2,3\u201313C2]lactate isotopomers is only possible via this pathway (Figure 3A). The relative metabolic flux rates of PK, YPC, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and anaplerosis leading to succinyl-CoA (Ys) were estimated using glutamate 13C-isotopomer distribution data obtained from 13C-NMR analysis of the cell extracts. All flux rates are referenced to a citrate synthase (CS) flux of 1 and is equivalent to Kreb\u2019s cycle flux. Using tcaCALC, multiple different metabolic models can be compared to each other, with the most parsimonious model selected (Figure 3D) (Alger et al., 2021). HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells significantly increased the PK and YPC fluxes compared to WT cells, and the Akt2 or HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors significantly decreased the PK and YPC flux rates in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells compared to untreated cells (Figure 3D). Additionally, we have performed the same metabolic flux analysis using the [U-13C]glucose tracer for HeLa WT and HeLa MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells to confirm the effect of MUL1 knockout on energy metabolism in an alternative cell line. Glutamate isotopomer analysis of HeLa WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells shows the same effects of increased pyruvate anaplerosis into the TCA cycle as well as he significant flux through PK (Supplementary Figures S1C, D). These results closely mirror those seen in the HEK293 cells."

ECAR was measured for both HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and WT cells in the presence or absence of dimethyloxalyglycine (DMOG), a known activator of HIF-1\u03b1 (Zhdanov et al., 2015). HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) had substantially reduced glycolysis compared to MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (Figure 4A). When HIF-1\u03b1 was activated in HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells, there was a small but significant increase in glycolysis, as well as glycolytic capacity (Figure 4B). The same treatment in HEK293 WT cells was unremarkable (Figures 4A,B). Figure 4C shows the western blot analysis to monitor the protein expression and activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and Akt2 proteins in HEK293 WT and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells before or after treatment with DMOG. Figure 4D shows a densitometric analysis of the western blot data from 4C normalized against \u03b2-actin. The combined data from these experiments strongly suggest that the accumulation and activation of both Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 are required for the glycolytic phenotype observed in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. Furthermore, we performed a13C-NMR-based metabolic flux analysis to determine the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 on metabolism in HEK293 cells by HIF-1\u03b1 activation in the absence of Akt2 protein. The isotopomer results from 13C-NMR spectra of HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) + DMOG cells are summarized in Figure 4E. The 13C-labeling pattern in glutamate for C2D12 and C2D23 multiplets was significantly different between HEK293 Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) + DMOG cells (Figure 4E). Metabolic flux analysis results suggested that the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 by DMOG significantly increased PK, YPC, and YS fluxes (Figure 4F). The metabolic fluxes of Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) cells with or without DMOG were also compared with those of HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells and are plotted in Supplementary Figure S2. Akt2 knockout significantly downregulates the PK flux compared to HEK293 WT cells. PK flux was partially restored with DMOG but did not reach the WT levels, while YPC was elevated above WT but fell short of reaching MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) levels (Supplementary Figure S2). Anaplerosis via succinyl-CoA (Ys) was significantly lower in both Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) and Akt2(\u2212/\u2212) + DMOG cells compared to that of WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (Supplementary Figure S2).

The supervised partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was used to predict the classes of samples and maximize the separation between groups (Figures 5B\u2013E). To determine the robustness of the mathematical model, R 2 and Q2 parameter values were calculated for the PLS-DA model. The R 2/Q2 values for the LC-MS positive and negative ion mode data were 0.98/0.70 and 0.90/0.30, respectively (Figures 5B\u2013E). The PLS-DA variable importance projection (VIP) score plot from the LC-MS positive and negative mode PLS-DA models identified a large group of metabolites different from HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells (Figures 5C\u2013F). Heatmaps of the top 25 metabolites from both positive and negative mode MS demonstrated excellent clustering of the samples based on MUL1 status (Supplementary Figures S3A, B). Significantly different metabolites were identified by either PLS-DA or t-test, class membership for each sample. The semi-quantitative metabolomic panel from the LC-MS positive and negative mode data in Supplementary Figure S4 summarized the significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells.

All significantly different metabolites between HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells were utilized for metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) to produce a network of pathways. MSEA results indicate that the provided metabolite set has significantly enriched the glutamate, arginine, proline, and ammonia recycling metabolic pathways.

The functional enrichment analysis of data identified that a large proportion of the regulated genes in HEK293 MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells are important for metabolic processes, including lipid, glucose, retinoic acid, carbohydrate, and glutathione metabolism. Our analysis indicated that the deletion of MUL1 upregulates a group of genes including CYP2E1, FABP6, PNPLA1, ACSBG1, AKR1C3, AKR1C1, and PIP5K1C that are involved in lipid transport, prostaglandin, progesterone, triglyceride, and retinoic acid metabolic process.

Metabolic regulation involves the coordinate function of numerous proteins located in different subcellular compartments including mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Mitochondria continuously communicate their current bioenergetic and biosynthetic states to the rest of the cell through various signaling pathways and they can alter their function to accommodate changing metabolic demands (Mishra and Chan, 2016). One of the many ways by which mitochondria communicate is through signaling proteins located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). In this present study, we focused on one such protein, the mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its potential role in the regulation of metabolism. MUL1 is located in the OMM, and its function has been implicated in mitophagy, cell death, mitochondrial dynamics, and innate immune response (Zhang et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2013; Yun et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2016; Ni et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2019; Cilenti et al., 2020). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MUL1 interacts with various E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to ubiquitinate specific substrates (Ambivero et al., 2014). MUL1 can perform two types of ubiquitination, where either the lysine 48 (K48) or the lysine 63 (K63) of the ubiquitin is involved in the isopeptide linkage (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Livnat-Levanon and Glickman, 2011). In addition, MUL1 can function as a SUMO E3 ligase to attach SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) onto specific substrates (Braschi et al., 2009; Prudent et al., 2015; Doiron et al., 2017). We investigated MUL1\u2019s K48 ubiquitination that invariably targets substrates for proteasomal degradation. We describe that at least four substrates are regulated and accumulate in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells: ULK1, MFN2, HIF-1\u03b1, and Akt2 proteins (see Figure 1) (Bae et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; Escobar-Henriques and Joaquim, 2019; Cilenti et al., 2020). We focused our studies on Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 coregulation by MUL1 since activation of these proteins is involved in metabolic phenotypes that favors glycolysis, a hallmark of cancer cells referred to as the Warburg effect (Lu et al., 2002; Pavlides et al., 2009). We found that inactivation of MUL1 leads to suppression of OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. In addition, steady-state flux rates show an increased activity of YPC and PK flux in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. These metabolic changes can be reversed by specific Akt2 or HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors. Furthermore, our data indicate that the metabolic phenotype of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells is distinct from the glycolytic state observed in cancer cells (Warburg effect), where increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) switch OXPHOS to glycolysis (Park et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). We performed detailed metabolomic analyses of MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells that clearly show that MUL1 has a very important role in both metabolic and lipidomic regulation. Detailed metabolomic and genomic analyses using HEK293 WT and MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells were employed to investigate the state of metabolic pathways. The results demonstrate that there are significant differences in the metabolites and the gene expression profiles between these 2\u00a0cell lines. The multi-omics approach identified a number of metabolic pathways that were perturbed in the absence of MUL1. These include glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and retinol metabolism. Lipidomic analysis showed significant accumulation of neutral head groups containing lipids such as triglycerides and diacylglycerides in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. The overall levels of other lipid species such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and ceramides were unaffected by MUL1 inactivation in HEK293 cells. Figure 8 summarizes the proposed MUL1\u2019s function and pathway in the regulation of metabolism based on the data presented here.",
                "Our multifaceted analysis shows that MUL1 is involved in the regulation of metabolism and its inactivation/downregulation can lead to a distinct metabolic state not previously described. The MUL1 protein level is known to be regulated, but the mechanism(s) is not fully characterized. Our previous studies identified Omi/HtrA2, a serine protease located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), as a major regulator of the MUL1 protein level (Cilenti et al., 2014). Omi/HtrA2 has a role in protein quality control within the IMS, and its activity is modulated by oxidative stress, the HAX1 protein, as well as by the NDUFA13 subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (Faccio et al., 2000; Cilenti et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2010; Chaganti et al., 2013; Ruan et al., 2017; Kummari et al., 2021). In addition, K48-autoubiquitination of MUL1 is another potential mechanism that can target the ligase for degradation and regulate its protein level (Li et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2018).",
                "Besides the involvement of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 in the regulation of metabolism by MUL1, the participation of other MUL1-substrate proteins, such as the MFN2 and ULK1 proteins, cannot be excluded. Accumulation of MFN2 and ULK1 is also observed in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells. In addition, MFN2 has been implicated in the regulation of metabolism in cancer cells and shown to interact with PKM2 (Nemazanyy et al., 2013; Li et al., 2019). ULK1 plays a major role in autophagy but can also phosphorylate key glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), enolase 1 (ENO1), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), in response to nutritional deprivation (Li et al., 2016). This dual parallel function of ULK1 can sustain the activity of multiple glycolytic enzymes and support metabolic homeostasis during amino acid and growth factor deprivation (Li et al., 2016). In our studies, we used specific inhibitors to establish that Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 are the main \u201cdrivers\u201d of the MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) metabolic phenotype; any potential role MFN2 and/or ULK1 might have in this process will be downstream of these two proteins."

                "We identified a new function for the mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the regulation of metabolism. The mechanism involves the K48-polyubiquitinating function of the ligase and the coregulation of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 proteins. The accumulation and co-activation of Akt2 and HIF-1\u03b1 in MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells drive and maintain this new metabolic phenotype characterized by the activated pyruvate carboxylation and PK flux, along with increased aerobic glycolysis. In addition, MUL1(\u2212/\u2212) cells have a distinct lipid metabolism characterized by increased triglyceride and diacylglycerol storage. These results support a very important role for MUL1 ligase in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and lipogenesis including a new metabolic state of aerobic glycolysis."
