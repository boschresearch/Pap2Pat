                        "Clinical diagnosis of cancer is a complex process usually initiated by presentation of indicative symptoms. Suspected conditions are identified as possible differential diagnosis and a battery of blood tests, urinalysis, imaging tests, and biopsy are conducted before final diagnosis is made. Biomarkers have been identified for some cancers, but have limited use as a primary screening tool.",
                        "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a spontaneously occurring neoplasm of particular interest. NHL newly affects 69,740 people annually in the United States (1) and has had a steadily increasing incidence in the United States and Europe (2). If diagnosed early, effective treatments can be selected (2, 3) and the 5 year survival is 72% (1). However, diagnosis is complicated by the lack of a non-invasive test and is presently made by clinical signs, physical examination findings and imaging, with confirmation of disease by biopsy.",
                        "Even with effective treatment, 50% of patients with aggressive lymphomas have residual disease and eventually relapse (4). Lymphoma is one of the most commonly encountered canine neoplasms, generally affecting middle-aged to older dogs. Breeds reported to be at increased risk include boxers, bull mastiffs, Bassett hounds, Saint Bernards, Scottish terriers, Airedales, golden retrievers and English bulldogs (6). Typically dogs present with an aggressive high-grade multicenteric lymphoma, of which diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype (5). Following chemotherapy, 95% all dogs relapse following a period of remission.",
                        "While approximately 85% of dogs present with multicentric peripheral lymphadenopathy, a small percentage present with visceral disease only (e.g. primary mediastinal, gastrointestinal or hepatosplenic forms), which requires serial imaging in order to monitor remission status. In humans, remission status is monitored by CT, MRI or PET scans (2). Facile and early detection of relapse may facilitate re-induction of remission and improve outcome."

                        "This disclosure relates to the application of immunosignature methods to diagnosis and characterization of canine lymphoma. A single blood test capable of diagnosing cancer with high sensitivity and specificity would enhance patient care by streamlining the diagnostic process. A serological test for monitoring lymphoma would have utility at multiple stages: early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of residual disease.",
                        "Spontaneous canine lymphoma and human NHL have nearly identical presentations and pathologies, making them ideal partner species in which to explore blood based diagnostics. A serological test would facilitate routine monitoring during an annual wellness examination, enable faster diagnosis when lymphoma is suspected and allow monitoring of lymphoma following treatment. Design of such a test for lymphoma is dependent on the identification of an appropriate biomarker.",
                        "Ideally, this test would be applicable to early disease, but to do so it must overcome the \u201cblood dilution\u201d problem: that is, if 106 initiating cancer cells release 1000 molecules each of a biomarker into two liters of blood at steady state, the concentration of this biomarker would only be 1.3\u00d710\u221214 M), placing it below the detection limits of even the best assays.",
                        "Antibodies are an ideal solution to this problem. Self-reactive antibodies have been reported in cancers and autoimmune disease. Arising early in the course of a disease, the activation of a single B cell results in an \u02dc1011 amplification of signal in only a week. Furthermore, antibodies are stable in blood, enabling archived samples to be used in assay development or serial monitoring.",
                        "In view of the above, a new technology termed immunosignaturing has been developed which displays the circulating antibody repertoire upon an addressable, machine readable random peptide microarray. The random sequences allow an unbiased display of all types of antibody binding. The peptides on the microarray serve as mimetics of the actual epitopes and capitalize on the cross-reactivity of antibodies. Even if the actual epitope is not present, another peptide that the same antibody can bind will be present. In addition, the arrays are inexpensive and can be adapted to high throughput sample processing.",
                        "In embodiments disclosed herein, the immunosignature is used to characterize the humoral response to canine lymphoma and demonstrate its clinical utility in diagnosing different subtypes of disease. Pretreatment serum samples from patients presenting with T cell and B cell LSA are compared to healthy dogs. Serial serum samples from patients that experienced remission following chemotherapy and ultimately relapsed are also disclosed. Immunosignatures informative for each subtype of disease and their diagnostic efficacy are reported."

Anti-Dog IgG (gamma) from KPL was used in the first batch of arrays and Anti-Dog IgG (gamma) from Jackson Immuno Research was used in the second batch due to discontinuation of the KPL conjugate.

The ComBat algorithm was used to minimize assay batch effects on per chip median normalized scores.

Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) was able to separate LSA and healthy with 94% accuracy. A ROC curve is shown in FIG. 1C.

Serum from all B cell LSA patients (n=38) and healthy donors (n=39) were randomized and used to probe the CIM10Kv2. Technical requirements necessitated that serum from all dogs be run on a second print run of the CIM10Kv2 and detected using a different secondary antibody due to product discontinuation by the original supplier.",

When the training set arrays from print run 1 were used to predict the test set from print run 2, the accuracy was 97%: one LSA-B patient was miscalled as healthy. This accuracy was the same whether the training set arrays were from the same or different batch than the test set.",
                                "To exclude the possibility that the distinction between LSA and healthy was an artifact of this division of training and test sets, the dogs were iteratively randomized into training (75%) and test (25%) sets. The training set was used to select peptides having a p value <0.05 with FDR and a minimum fold change between classes of 1.5 fold. The peptides were then used to train an SVM and predict class membership of the test set. Over 10,000 randomizations into training and test sets, the median performance on the test set accuracy was 88.2%, sensitivity was 88.9% and specificity was 87% (Table 2).",
                                "To assess the how much of the immunosignature is due to other factors, all healthy and B cell lymphoma dogs were combined and divided based on gender and age. Separation of dogs into two classes based on age (division was 7 years old) yielded 14 significant peptides that were unable to classify the dogs on either a PCA or SVM. Further separation into male and female dogs yielded one significant peptide that was unable to classify in either a PCA or SVM. This suggests that the difference in immunosignature based on health or disease is due to the lymphoma not another factor. Taken together, this demonstrates that the immunosignature is both capable of predicting an independent test set and is stable across array print runs and detection systems.",

For this reason, immunophenotyping is commonly performed as part of initial staging in dogs with LSA. The immunosignature of the B cell LSA (n=14) and T cell LSA (n=11) patients were compared using a Student's T-test and 47 peptides had a p value less than 0.05 with FDR and a minimum 1.5 fold difference between classes.

Leave one out cross validation was able to separate LSA and healthy with 88% accuracy: one member of each class was misidentified, a ROC curve is shown in FIG. 3C. Interestingly, one of the B cell patients clustering with the T cell patients and classified as a T cell patient was confirmed to have a CD3 positive lymphoma. A similar distinction was made using the CIM10Kv1 arrays (data not shown). This demonstrates that the immunosignature can distinguish lymphomas of B and T cell origin.",

We have observed individual immunosignatures in human myeloma, another clonal B cell disease (Stafford et al, in preparation). This raises the possibility of an immunosignature for each lymphoma patient in addition to the general class immunosignature. Such an immunosignature could be either from the antibody species produced by the B cell or the immune response to the surface markers or other cancer related antigens of the lymphoma cell. In the case of a T cell lymphoma there could be a unique antibody response to the T cell receptor of the lymphoma clone. Pattern matching analysis was done to identify peptides uniquely recognized by each dog.",
                                "To reduce the influence of recent vaccines or infections, the peptides with the least variability in healthy donors (bottom quartile ranked on CV) were analyzed. The pattern used was the per peptide median for all dogs except the LSA patient being queried for which the value was set at 5 fold above the per peptide median. Peptides matching the profile with a Pearson correlation greater than 0.90 were defined as unique to that individual. A heatmap of the unique peptides is presented in FIG. 4a. The median number of peptides identified in the B cell LSA dogs was 8 (range: 3 to 71) and the median number of identified peptides in the T cell LSA patients was 6 (range: 2 to 6). No peptides matching these profiles were bound in the healthy dogs.",
                                "If these unique peptides are bound by a single antibody clone, then a motif could be present in the peptide list. Sequence motifs were identified using the GLAM2 algorithm and representative motifs are presented as logo plots in FIG. 4b & c. Individual immunosignatures with associated motifs were also seen on the CIM10Kv1 (not shown). Taken together, these data agree with the clonal nature of the disease and suggest that the individual immunosignature may be the result of a single antibody clone, whether that produced by the involved B cell clone or to a unique antigen such as the BCR or TCR idiotype",

The sera was run on the CIM10Kv2 and evaluated for changes both personal and subtype immunosignatures. Comparison of the individual immunosignatures between diagnosis and remission indicated that a median of 72 percent of the immunosignature decreased following initiation of treatment (Table 3). This suggests that the individual lymphoma immunosignature has utility in establishing or verifying remission.",
                                "However, the antibody reactivity level of these peptides did not return to the level observed in normal dogs. This suggests that the immune response generated against the lymphoma may be maintained by the small number of cells that lead to the recurrence. Peptides decreasing at remission did not also increase at relapse. Survival of the minimal residual disease cells and the lack of the return of decreased peptides to pretreatment levels suggests that the tumor was kept in check by the immune umbrella of the original tumor but new antigens and pathways enabled relapse.",

For the 177 peptides increased in B cell LSA, a median of 25+/\u221214 peptides (14%) decreased at remission and 13+/\u22127 peptides increased from remission to relapse. Of the 173 peptides increased in T cell LSA, a median of 35+/\u221220 peptides (20%) decreased upon remission and a median of 21.4+/\u22126 peptides (12%) increased between remission and relapse.",

Clinical therapy either excises or chemically kills the LSA cell removing the antigen that stimulated the normal B cell. Persistence of the immunosignature after removal of the LSA cell suggests that the normal B cell had differentiated to a long lived plasma cell and was unaffected by remission. Taken together, this indicates that the immunosignature can verify remission through the personalized signature, but other means are needed to detect recurrence.",

                                "Retrospective surveys of T cell LSA-T and B cell LSA identified median DFIs of 2.5 months for T cell LSA and 6.74 months for B cell LSA. In this study and in clinical practice, dogs with B cell LSA tended to have a higher proportion of survivors at later months, indicating a need to further characterize the B cell LSA immunosignature. The median raw feature intensity of arrays probed with serum from B cell LSA patients and healthy donors were compared. The median raw feature intensity of the arrays probed with B cell LSA were significantly lower (p=1\u00d710\u22124)) than those probed with healthy donors (FIG. 5a).",
                                "In prior studies, overall feature intensity increases were noted in infection and as the concentration of antibodies applied to the array increases. This suggests that either the overall amount of immunoglobulin or reactivity is depressed in B cell LSA patients, fitting with clinical studies of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in humans, in which observed serum hypogammaglobemmia in 10 to 15% of patients and a 21% reduction of crude median IgG levels in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients.",
                                "Next the distribution of antibody reactivities were compared on the CIM10Kv2 array between LSA-B patients and healthy donors. Entropy measures the distribution of antibody reactivities across the intensities of features present on the array. Entropy in LSA-B patients was significantly decreased (FIG. 5b), suggesting that the circulating antibody repertoire was driven to a reduced distribution of antibody species and by extension over representation of the producing B cell clones. No correlation of either the dynamic range, median intensity or entropy was observed with the length of the disease free interval.",
                                "The Immunosignature of B Cell LSA at Diagnosis is Capable of Predicting Length of Disease Free Interval in Dogs Entering Remission.",
                                "Since changes in the individual or class immunosignatures following treatment were not indicative of relapse, we sought to determine if the immunosignature at diagnosis could predict time to relapse. The LSA-B patients were divided into those that relapsed in under 120 days (n=10) and those that had a delayed relapse of over 120 days (n=23). A Student's T-test identified 35 peptides with a p value <0.05 with FDR between classes.",
                                "A heatmap of the selected peptides is presented in FIG. 6a. Separation of the patients based on DFI is presented in the PCA plot shown in FIG. 6b. Note that the dogs having a longer DFI cluster more tightly than those with a short DFI having median Mahalanobis distances to the class means of 13.66 and 17.27 respectively, indicating less variance in the under 120 day immunsignature than the over 120 day immunosignature. An SVM trained on the 35 peptides has a LOOCV accuracy of 97%. A ROC curve is presented in FIG. 6c. This demonstrates that the immunosignature is capable of predicting the length of the DFI at the time of diagnosis.",
                                "Discussion.",
                                "In the present study, immunosignatures have been used to characterize canine lymphoma and evaluated the immunosignature technology as a diagnostic. It has been demonstrated that lymphoma patients can be readily distinguished from healthy dogs. The immunosignature of lymphoma was capable of predicting an independent test set with high accuracy and was robust to print run and detection system changes. Furthermore, the distinction between B and T-cell lymphomas was able to be determined from the immunosignature. Individualized immunosignatures were also observed in the LSA patients at diagnosis, which declined as patients entered remission. The individualized immunosignature did not return at relapse for all dogs; however, the immunosignature at diagnosis was capable of predicting the length of the DFI. Taken together, this study demonstrates the clinical utility of the immunosignature as a multilevel diagnostic for lymphoma.",
                                "Lymphoma is a clonal disease arising from an abnormally proliferating B or T cell. Despite the clonal origin of the disease, an LSA specific immunosignature was identifiable. In humans, certain variable region genes are prevalent in lymphoma and superantigens are LSA associated, raising the possibility that the immunosignature is that of a causal immunological insult. Proteomic studies in humans have identified distinct protein expression profiles that are informative not only for LSA, but clinical subtype.",
                                "This raises the possibility that the immunosignature is reflecting cancer antigens associated with lymphoma. In individual dogs, an individual immunosignature was additionally detected and may be the product of the individual B cell clone while the class immunosignature was reflective of the underlying cancer biology. The influence of the antibody produced by the individual B cell clone is reflected in the immunosignature distinguishing LSA-B and LSA-T, where the LSA-T patients cluster together much more tightly on the PCA than do LSA-B patients.",
                                "The observation that the personalized immunosignature declined as the dog entered remission while the lymphoma class immunosignature does fit with the biology of the respective B cells. The causal B cell clone that formed the lymphoma is present in abundance at diagnosis and is excised or chemically reduced to barely detectable levels at remission, yet antibodies against the lymphoma persist. Serum IgG in dogs have a half-life of 8 to 12 days, indicating that at the three-month sampling, serum levels of the anti-LSA antibody species could have reduced to 1 to 6% of the diagnosis titer. This suggests that the anti-LSA antibody response has differentiated to long lived plasma cells which have a 140 day half-life and is largely unaffected by immunosuppressive chemotherapy.",
                                "That the personalized immunosignature did not increase upon relapse suggests that either other antigens are involved in triggering relapse of a dormant tumor cell, somatic hypermutation has occurred, or the relapse is actually a second clonal lineage initiating an antigenically distinct LSA tumor. The disease free interval in both dogs and humans is a period of watchful waiting punctuated with frequent recheck examinations, blood draws and imaging. The immunosignature at diagnosis is capable of identifying dogs having an aggressive lymphoma that relapsed in less than four months from those with a less aggressive form.",
                                "Conversion of a microarray based assay to a diagnostic is reliant on the robustness of the platform to differences in technician, print batch and detection system. In the training and test set, the sum effect of these conditions were evaluated. The training set was initially run as one batch then repeated in the second batch with the test set. When the SVM was trained using either training set batch, the test set was predicted with >94% accuracy. This demonstrates that as a practical diagnostic assay, a single patient could be normalized to a co-run standard and the immunosignature compared to a database, thereby alleviating the impractical possibility of having to run a 60 sample training set with each assay. Thus, a kit for diagnosing canine lymphoma may be provided that includes, for example, an array of immobilized peptides, a reagent for detecting a binding pattern of any antibodies to the peptides on the array, and a reference binding pattern indicative of lymphoma (e.g., access instructions to a database containing the reference pattern(s)).",
                                "These examples illustrate the immunosignature as an improvement over current veterinary serodiagnostics for lymphoma. As opposed to tests which either non-specifically indicate a cancer by measuring thymidine kinase activity or rely on biomarkers, the immunosignature is information rich. From a single assay, the patient could potentially be diagnosed as having lymphoma or not, whether the lymphoma is of B or T cell lineage and whether the DFI following chemotherapy will be short or long.",
                                "Each of these points of information is critical for the treating veterinarian. A negative immunosignature for LSA aids in the differential diagnosis, B cell LSA and T cell LSA may be treated differently, and knowing at diagnosis that the DFI will be short may provide important prognostic information to the pet owner and veterinarian. Given the similarity between both disease and immune system function in dogs and humans, the immunosignature is expected to provide the same information to physicians and their patients."
