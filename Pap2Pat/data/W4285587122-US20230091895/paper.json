    "title": "Development and characterization of a camelid derived antibody targeting a linear epitope in the hinge domain of human PCSK9 protein",

    "abstract": "PCSK9 is an effective target for lowering LDL-c. Previously, a camelid-human chimeric heavy chain antibody VHH-B11-Fc targeting human PCSK9 was designed. It had a potent hypolipidemic effect. However, the nanobody VHH-B11 interacts with PCSK9 at low affinity, while camelid VHH exhibits some immunogenicity. Moreover, the interacting epitope is yet to be identified, although VHH-B11 was shown to have distinct hPCSK9-binding epitopes for Evolocumab. This might impede the molecule\u2019s progress from bench to bedside. In the present study, we designed various configurations to improve the affinity of VHH-B11 with hPCSK9 (< 10 nM) that in turn enhanced the druggability of VHH-B11-Fc. Then, 17 amino acids were specifically mutated to increase the degree of humanization of the nanobody VHH-B11. Using phage display and sequencing technology, the linear epitope \u201cSTHGAGW\u201d (amino acids 447\u2013452) was identified in the hinge region of PCSK9 as the interacting site between VHH-B11-Fc and hPCSK9. Unlike the interaction epitope of Evolocumab, located in the catalytic region of PCSK9, the binding epitope of VHH-B11 is located in the hinge region of PCSK9, which is rarely reported. These findings indicated that a specific mechanism underlying this interaction needs to be explored.",

                "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases refer to the general term for some diseases, including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral apoplexy, myocarditis, and other ischemic or hemorrhagic diseases caused by the following symptoms: hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and/or hypertension1. Despite adopting the most advanced treatments for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,\u2009>\u200950% of survivors of these diseases are unable to care for themselves and the quality of life declines severely. Previous studies have reported that cardiovascular disease has a mortality of up to 15 million people each year, surpassing cancer as the leading cause of death2\u20134. Presently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coA reductase inhibitor is the first-line clinical lipid-lowering statin. However, recent studies have shown that some patients will develop drug tolerance if statin is administered for a prolonged time; then, the treatment needs to be discontinued, seeking other lipid-lowering approaches1,2,5.",
                "An effective and safe drug is the monoclonal antibody (Ab)6,7. In a previous study, we designed and developed a llama-human chimera heavy chain VHH-B11-Fc Ab, which showed similar lipid-lowering effects to the approved Evolocumab drug in hepatoma cells and human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (hPCSK9) transgenic rat model7. However, the druggability of this Ab is not excellent, which is manifested as inadequate affinity (>\u20090.1\u00a0nM), immunogenicity (camelid variable region) and unknown epitopes. Therefore, the present study aimed to improve the druggability of this potential drug molecule in the following aspects. The affinity of therapeutic Ab should be\u2009\u2264\u20090.1\u00a0nM. Hence, we attempted to improve the affinity between the VHH-B11 Ab and PCSK9. For instance, the transformation of fragmentary Ab from monovalent to polyvalent effectively improves the affinity and function8\u201310. This is mainly achieved by short peptide ligation (\u201cCablivi\u201d from Ablynx Inc.) and Fc fusion (\u201cKN035\u201d from Alphamab Oncology Inc.)11\u201313. Secondly, good therapeutic Abs should have low immunogenicity. The high immunogenicity may cause major side effects14. For instance, Pfizer had discontinued the global development of bococizumab because of its high immunogenicity in 201615. In this study, the humanization degree of the VHH-B11 was improved by replacing some hot spot amino acids16. Finally, we identified the interaction epitope between the VHH-B11-Fc Ab and human PCSK9 (hPCSK9) based on sequencing, phage display, and random polypeptide library technologies. All in a word, the present study aimed to develop and characterize a camelid derived Ab (VHH-B11-Fc) reported previously."

                        "Multiple systems were adopted to express the VHH-B11 Ab to seek a cost-effective Ab preparation method, preferably with one-step affinity purification for later preparation. Briefly, VHH was expressed in three expression systems (Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) and HEK293F mammalian cells). As shown in Fig.\u00a01 and Figs. S1\u2013S5, the VHH-B11 Ab was expressed successfully in the three different systems. VHH-B11 was expressed in BL21 E. coli (lane 1: pET28a-VHH-B11), TG1 E. coli (lane 2: pMECS-VHH-B11), and HB2151 E. coli (lane 3: pMECS-VHH-B11) (Fig.\u00a01A and Figs. S1\u2013S3). Due to the intracellular and low soluble expression in BL21 E. coli (pET28a, lane 1), adequate results by only one step Ni2+ affinity purification is difficult. Also, ultrasonication resulted in partial degradation of the VHH-B11 Ab. In the case of TG1 E. coli (lane 2: pMECS-VHH-B11), the undesired protein band (~\u200930\u00a0kDa) appeared on the gel. Lane B is the blank control. In lane 3, HB2151 E. coli (pMECS-VHH-B11) also seems to be not very suitable for VHH protein expression. Because one-step Ni2+-affinity purification provided an unsatisfactory eluate. As shown in Fig.\u00a01B and Figs. S4, S5, the monovalent nanobody VHH-B11 was expressed in P. pastoris (lane 4) and HEK293F mammalian cells (lane 5). Because of the secretory expression, a favorable purification was achieved in a single Ni2+ affinity purification step without lysis. Due to the amount of heteroprotein bands that may require multi-stage purification, the three E. coli expression systems are not our preferred choice. Besides, considering the competitive advantages of low cost and convenient purification, yeast secretion seems to be a more optimal VHH expression system than that of mammalian cells. Furthermore, the affinity between PCSK9 and VHH-B11 expressed by P. pastoris was determinated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. As shown in Fig.\u00a02A, VHH-B11 had an interaction affinity with PCSK9 at 4.436\u00a0nM.Figure 1The SDS\u2013PAGE gel of the VHH-B11. M1: the protein marker (Fermentas, USA).

To increase the affinity and prolong the half-life of the VHH, we designed a series of VHH-based polyvalent Abs that can be divided into two classes of Ab configurations (Fig.\u00a03). One was for non-IgG-like strategy (Fig.\u00a03C,D) and the other for IgG-like strategy (Fig.\u00a03F\u2013J). However, both increased the affinity of VHH-B11 by\u2009>\u2009ten-fold or about 100-fold (Table 1). Peptide linker was used to form tandem bivalent or multivalent Abs for affinity increase.

                        "The second type of IgG-like Abs mediate the augmentation of the biological half-life period because of Fc fusion that is expressed in the eukaryotic expression system, including P. pastoris and HEK293F cells. Five configurations were designed (Fig.\u00a03F\u2013J). Herein, VHH-Fc (Figs. 3F, 4, S6 lane 7: 75\u00a0kDa) has the hinge linker of the human IgG4 type, and the affinity increased ten-fold (VHH-Fc vs. VHH) (Fig. 2B,\u00a0Table 1). VHH-CH1-Fc (Fig.\u00a03G) is a recombinant heavy chain and has a very low expression due to lack of stability.",

VHH-VHH-Fc (Figs. 3H, 4,\u00a0S7 lane 8:\u2009~\u2009110\u00a0kDa) has two hinge linkers; the llama long hinge peptide of the IgG2 type was used to link bivalent VHHs, and the hinge linker of the human IgG4 type was used to link human Fc. The Fc region of this tetravalent conformation is fully exposed. Also, its affinity increased ten-fold (VHH-VHH-Fc vs. VHH) (Fig. 2D,\u00a0Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3I, VHH-VHH-CH1-Fc configuration has a low expression, and the protein band is\u2009~\u2009155\u00a0kDa (Figs. 4, S8: lane 9). The last tetravalent Ab is VHH-Fc-VHH configuration (Figs. 3J, 4, S9: lane 10). The Fc region of this conformation acts as a linker. Similarly, its affinity to PCSK9 also increased ten-fold. A previous study reported an increased functionality of Fc-fused configuration10. Hence, the tetravalent Ab format VHH-VHH-Fc is relatively the best conformation based on the appropriate molecular weight, increased affinity, Fc exposure and medium expression level."

To improve the degree of humanization of VHH-B11 (Fig.\u00a05: lane1, we designed humanized VHH-B11 (Hu-B11) with all the 17 humanized amino acid mutation sites (Table 2). Surprisingly, Hu-B11 (Fig.\u00a05 and Fig. S12: lane5) has a normal expression level similar to the wild-type VHH-B11 (~\u200920\u00a0mg/L), but the affinity decreased by nine-fold such that Hu-B11 has an affinity interaction with hPCSK9 (4.4\u00a0nM vs. 39.7\u00a0nM) (Fig.\u00a02A vs. Fig. S14A). However, each FR region has five or six humanization sites, and Hu-B11 has a high humanized degree; thus, affinity maturation is needed in the future. If not, it is highly likely that unsatisfactory pharmacodynamic evaluation effect will be obtained.Figure 5The SDS-PAGE gel of the VHH-B11 humanized antibodies.

                        "In order to identify which amino acid position plays a critical role, we designed and expressed another nine VHH-B11 humanized mutants named by VHH-Z1-Z9 in P. pastoris (~\u200915\u00a0kDa, Fig.\u00a05, Figs. S10\u2013S13 and Table 2). Most of these differed from each other by only one amino acid. For instance, VHH-Z1 (Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S11: lane 2, S14C) and VHH-Z6, VHH-Z2 (Fig.\u00a05 and Fig. S11: lane 3) and VHH-Z5 (Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S13: lane 7, S14D), and VHH-Z3 (Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S12: lane 4, S14B) and VHH-Z4 (Fig.\u00a05 and Fig. S13: lane 6) all have only one amino acid difference between each other. Among these, Hu-B11, VHH-Z3 and VHH-Z5 are expressed normally (~\u200920\u00a0mg/L) in yeast, but the others have very low expression levels (<\u20091\u00a0mg/L), and VHH-Z9 is not expressed. There is only a single amino acid difference that can cause high or low expression and affinity (Fig.\u00a05, Figs. S10\u2013S13 and Table 2), as well as failure. Also, it could be speculated that these amino acid positions play critical roles. For instance, compared to the normal expression of VHH-Z1 (80Pro) (Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S11: lane 2, S14C), one amino acid difference (80Pro vs. 80Arg) in FR3 region causes low expression of VHH-Z6 (80Arg). Another replacement of the 87Val in the FR3 region of VHH-Z5 (normal expression, Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S13: lane 7, S14D) also led to a low expression and affinity of VHH-Z2 (87Lys). Similarly, one amino acid difference in FR2 region led to normal expression and no decline in the affinity of VHH-Z3 (54Ala) (Fig.\u00a05 and Figs. S12: lane 4, S14B) but the very low expression and affinity of VHH-Z4 (54Ser). This finding suggested that these amino acid positions (no. 54, no. 80, and no. 87) may be crucial to the humanization of VHH-B11 protein.",
                        "On the other hand, the first five amino acids, \u201cQVQLQ\u201d of VHH-B11 were not indispensable because the protein expression, structure, and avidity of VHH-B11 were not affected without these initial amino acids (data not shown). In this case, VHH-Z9 expression failure could be attributed to the replacement of 83Ser in the FR3 region of VHH-Z3 (83Ala, normal expression,\u2009~\u200920\u00a0mg/L), indicating that 83Ala may also affect the normal formation of VHH-B11 Ab structure. When disregarding the initial five amino acids \u201cQVQLQ\u201d, VHH-Z2 and VHH-Z9 have only one amino acid difference at no. 54 (Ser vs. Ala). Among these, VHH-Z2 (Fig.\u00a05 and Fig. S11: lane 3) has some expression, and Z9 has no expression, which further emphasizes the importance of no. 54 amino acid position on protein expression. It is worth noting that due to a poor fit, only three concentration gradients were showed the kinetic binding of VHH-Z1 and Z5 to the hPCSK9. (Fig. S14C,D). As for other humanized VHHs, they have poor or even no binding to PCSK9, so they are not shown."

Further analyses showed similar motif characteristics (\u00d7\u2009S\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW,\u2009\u00d7\u2009T\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW or\u2009\u00d7\u2009H\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW) among several peptides; \u201c\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u201d represents one or more amino acids (Table S2). Three peptides are listed in Fig.\u00a06A. If \u201cGW\u201d or \u201cG\u201d is placed in the same amino acid position, Weblogo 3 analysis tool identified the most common features (\u201cSTSGAGW\u201d) of these short peptides after input of the peptides listed in Table S2 (Fig.\u00a06B). Interestingly, the hinge region of hPCSK9, 447\u2013452 amino acids (STHGAGW) met this characteristic. To verify this speculation, we designed and expressed wild-type hPCSK9 and four hPCSK9-deletants lacking some modules: PCSK9-\u03941(383\u2013405), PCSK9-\u03942(429\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03943(153\u2013449), and PCSK9-\u03944(450\u2013692) in HEK293F (Fig.\u00a06C). The numbers in parentheses represent the deletion range of amino acids. For instance, PCSK9-\u03941(383\u2013405) represents a PCSK9 deletant lacking 383\u2013405 amino acids (\u201cSGTSQAAAHVAGIAAMMLSAEPE\u201d). The PCSK9-\u03941 deletant was regarded as the irrelevant contrast, and the other three deletants were experimental groups that the predicted epitope was broken by removing different modules.Figure 6Epitope speculation and PCSK9 deletants design. (A)\u00a0Epitope speculation. Many polypeptides with similar \u201cGW\u201d motif characteristics (for example,\u2009\u00d7\u2009S\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW,\u2009\u00d7\u2009T\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW, or\u2009\u00d7\u2009H\u2009\u00d7\u2009GW.\u2009\u00d7\u2009represents any amino acid) were identified from the random library (Table S2). Three peptides were listed as an illustration. (B) PCSK9 deletants design. Placing \u201cGW\u201d in the same amino acid position facilitated the identification of the possible common features (\u201cSTSGAGW\u201d) of these short peptides after input in the Table S2 peptides by Weblogo 3 analysis tool. (C) Wild-type hPCSK9 and four hPCSK9-deletants lacked some modules: PCSK9-\u03941 (383\u2013405), PCSK9-\u03942 (429\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03943 (153\u2013449), and PCSK9-\u03944 (450\u2013692). hPCSK9 is composed of the signal peptide (amino acids 1\u201330), pro-domain (31\u2013152), catalytic domain (153\u2013407), hinge region (408\u2013452), and C-terminal region (453\u2013692). HA tag was fused for purification easily.",
                        "An immunoblot assay was performed to verify this prediction. PCSK9 and its deletants were loaded in the following sequence in groups of five samples (supernatants and cell precipitation lysate): PCSK9-\u03941(383\u2013405), PCSK9-\u03942(429\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03943(153\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03944(450\u2013692), and wild-type PCSK9. As shown in Fig.\u00a07A, anti-HA Ab was used as a primary Ab to assess whether PCSK9 was expressed intracellularly (Fig.\u00a07A, lanes 1\u20135, supernatants) and extracellularly (Fig.\u00a07A, lanes 6\u201310, cell lysate), while B11-Fc Ab was used as primary Ab to verify whether PCSK9 and the deletants could self-interact (Fig.\u00a07B, lanes 11\u201315, supernatants and Fig.\u00a07B, lanes 16\u201320, cell lysate). Anti-HA primary Ab group showed that wild-type PCSK9 was expressed extracellularly as well as intracellularly (~\u200966\u00a0kDa &\u2009~\u200972\u00a0kDa, Fig.\u00a07A, lanes 5 and 10), while all the PCSK9 deletants expressed only intracellularly (Fig.\u00a07A, lanes 6\u20139). Furthermore, B11-Fc primary Ab group showed that wild-type PCSK9 (Fig.\u00a07B, lanes 15 and 20) and the PCSK9-\u03941 deletant (the irrelevant contrast, Fig.\u00a07B, lane16) could still be detected by B11-Fc because of their intact epitope, but the other three deletants (PCSK9 \u03942-\u03944, Fig.\u00a07B lanes 17\u201319) not. These findings suggested that the broken epitope \u201cSTHGAGW\u201d (no. 447\u2013452) of the PCSK9 \u03942-\u03944 deletants would lead to the failure of detection by the specific Ab B11-Fc, deeming that this linear epitope is the interacting site between B11-Fc and PCSK9.Figure 7Immunoblot assay and epitope verification. Immunoblot assay was performed to verify the predicted epitope between PCSK9 and VHH-B11-Fc. PCSK9 and its deletants were loaded in the following sequence in groups of five samples (lanes 1\u20135 and 11\u201315: supernatants; lanes 6\u201310 and 16\u201320: cell precipitation lysate): PCSK9-\u03941 (383\u2013405), PCSK9-\u03942 (429\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03943 (153\u2013449), PCSK9-\u03944 (450\u2013692), and wild-type PCSK9\u00a0(red arrow).

The HRP-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. (B) The B11-Fc Ab was used as a primary Ab to check whether PCSK9 and the deletants could still interact specifically with B11-Fc (lanes11\u201320).

                "The single-domain Ab of camelidae is fragmentary and a therapeutic Ab. Due to the small size (~\u200915\u00a0kDa) and the fast metabolism (~\u200930\u00a0min) in the organisms19\u201321, appropriate modifications are essential to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic performances of single domain Abs22,23 that can be executed via VHH tandem (for example Cablivi: VHH-AlaAlaAla-VHH)11. However,\u00a0human IgG Fc fusion is the general strategy for therapeutic VHH Abs13,24. For instance, KN035 Ab has VHH-Fc structure approved as an orphan drug by the US FDA in 202012. Nevertheless, compared to conventional Abs, VHH tandem and/or Fc fusion is not optimal as it inevitably results in larger molecular weight, which in turn might alter the molecular structure and affect expression level and stability. Notably, human CH1 addition might also alter the structure of the camelid heavy chain Ab. For instance, VHH-Fc has a normal expression level, but VHH-CH1-Fc has a low expression level under the same conditions. Another example is VHH-VHH-Fc, with a normal expression level, but the quadrivalent VHH-VHH-CH1-Fc has a low expression level. These phenomena could be attributed to the lack of human CL1 domain coordination for CH1. Currently, researchers are seeking to maintain a balance of molecular weight, stability, pharmacodynamic efficacy and expression difficulty of the therapeutic Abs.",
                "Ab humanization is crucial to reduce the immunogenicity of antigen (Ag)25. Low immunogenicity can reduce the occurrence of side effects26. In a previous study, we reported that human IgG4 Fc was fused to the llama VHH to form chimeras7. In the present study, we carried out 17 \u201chot spot\u201d amino acid mutations to make it similar to the variable region of the human Ab gene16. However, the effect of immunogenicity reduction is to be evaluated in future studies27.",
                "Epitope identification in the interaction between Ag and Ab is conducive to clarifying the mechanism of efficacy of the Ab28. Because of its unique advantages, camelid VHH Ab utilizes the conformation or charge complementarity for selective Ag binding, which mimics the conserved intracellular protein\u2013protein interaction29.\u00a0This characteristic is rarely exhibited by conventional IgG Abs.\u00a0Reportedly, the interaction epitopes between the approved Evolocumab and PCSK9 are in the LDLR-binding site of the catalytic region30. In the present study, phage screening, random peptide library formation, and sequencing results proved that the VHH-B11-Fc binding epitope is in the hinge region of PCSK9. This phenomenon is rarely reported for anti-PCSK9 Ab. This method is economical, while the disadvantage is that only linear epitopes or linear parts of conformational epitopes can be identified. Thus, a better verification method, such as X-ray crystal diffraction, is required, especially for the conformational epitope. To obtain an ideal crystal of the Ag-Ab complex, some amino acid mutations on the molecular surface of protein31 are required; for example, the hinge region mutation, which in turn affects the binding of VHH-B11-Fc and PCSK9.\u00a0Thus, we opted for the random peptide library approach.",
                "In this study, we developed and characterized a camelid VHH-B11 Ab. The druggability of VHH-B11 has been enhanced adequately. Both VHH tandem and Fc fusion have been used to form polyvalent Ab, such as tetravalent VHH-VHH-Fc. It has a high affinity to hPCSK9 (0.1\u00a0nM). Moreover, it has a relatively high expression level (>\u200910\u00a0mg/L). Combined with the identified epitopes and good humanization results, this study provides experimental evidence for improved druggability of camelid-derived VHH Ab."
