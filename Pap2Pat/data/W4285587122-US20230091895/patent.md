# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to the field of biotechnology, in particular, to an antibody for PCSK9 and an application thereof, more particularly, to an antibody capable of specifically recognizing PCSK9 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, a nucleic acid molecule, an expression vector, a recombinant cell, a pharmaceutical composition, a pharmaceutical use, and a kit for detecting PCSK9.

## BACKGROUND

Cardiovascular diseases pose a serious threat to human beings, and are the leading cause of death for all human populations. Currently, statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, probucol, etc. are the main drugs in the market used for lowering cholesterol. Although statins have been shown to be effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with their widespread use, potential drawbacks have been identified. Firstly, patients treated with intensive statins still had a high residual risk of cardiovascular events, with a risk of incidence of 22.4% in 2 years; secondly, a large number of patients cannot tolerate statins, and especially for those with familial hypercholesterolemia, the goal of lowering the LDL-C concentration still cannot achieved even with treatment by the most effective statins at the maximum dose; most importantly, statins have a variety of side effects, such as causing abnormal blood glucose, muscle toxicity, memory and cognitive disorders, etc, with an incidence as high as 20%. Severe side effects may lead to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, and a significant proportion of patients discontinue treatment due to the inability to tolerate the muscle pain caused by the side effects.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a novel proprotein convertase of subtilisin subfamily, is one of the important factors affecting autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition to affecting the plasma cholesterol level and regulating neuronal apoptosis, PCSK9 has been found in research to be associated with inflammatory responses. Current research on PCSK9 mainly focused on the regulatory function of liver lipid metabolism. Previous studies have shown that PCSK9 can regulate liver lipid metabolism by promoting the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) in hepatocytes, thus affecting the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in plasma. However, PCSK9 has two types of mutations, gain-of-function mutations and loss-of-function mutations. Population studies have shown that several “gain-of-function” mutations of PCSK9 often occur in individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, while “loss-of-function” mutations of PCSK9 are associated with decreased plasma cholesterol. Individuals with loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 have significantly reduced risk of coronary heart diseases. In 2005, Hobbs et al. reported in Dallas Heart Study that the LDL-C level in individuals with PCSK9 nonsense mutation gene would be lower than that in normal people by 28%; in 2006, Hobbs et al. published the effect of PCSK9 gene mutation on coronary heart diseases. Based on an atherosclerosis risk survey, they followed 9523 Caucasians and 3363 African-American people for up to 15 years, and found that the incidence of coronary heart disease in the population lacking 1 or 2 PCSK9 functional genes was significantly lower than that in the normal population. Copenhagen Heart Study found that functional deletion of the PCSK9 gene decreased the LDL-C level by 11% to 15% and decreased the coronary heart disease incidence by 6% to 46%. Zimbabwe et al. reported that deletion mutations in PCSK9 decreased the LDL-C level in African women by 27%. PCSK9 inhibitors offer a completely new treatment mode to combat LDL-C and are considered as the greatest advance in the lipid lowering field subsequent to statins. The advent of PCSK9 inhibitors brings hope for patients who have severe side effects when taking statins, and for patients whose statin therapy fails to achieve target LDL-C levels, such as patients with hereditary hypercholesterolemia.

In addition to blocking LDL-R recovery, PCSK9 inhibitors also inhibit NF-κB channels, thereby reducing the risk of acute coronary syndromes such as thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular endothelial cell activation. At present, potential research projects in this field of PCSK9 inhibitors include inhibitory protein antibodies, siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecule inhibitors, etc. Monoclonal antibody drugs are the main research field of PCSK9 inhibitors because of their strong targeting effects, high specificity, and low toxicity. Studies at the animal level showed a significant increase in the LDL-R expression level in the liver in mice and a 30% decrease in LDL-C concentration in the blood of mice after the addition of neutralizing anti-PCSK9 antibodies. In primates, the PCSK9 monoclonal antibody also showed a significant effect, with reduced levels of LDL-C maintained for a few weeks or more. So far, no significant side effects of anti-PCSK9 protein monoclonal antibodies have been found. Only mild side effects such as local injection reaction, diarrhea, and headache have been reported. Praluent (Alirocumab) from Sanofi and Repatha (evolocumab) from Amgen are currently the only two humanized PCSK9 antibodies (whole IgG) approved in the global market. According to Thomson Reuters' list of approved drug potential sales in 2015, the Praluent (Alirocumab) reached $441.4 million by 2019, and the Repatha (evolocumab) reached $186.2 million by 2019.

Antibody drugs are the main direction of new drug research and development, and have been widely used in the field of infectious disease diagnosis, prevention and control, and biological science research. By 2015, 48 antibody drugs have been successfully marketed and 7 antibody drugs have been successfully approved only between April 2014 and March 2015. Six of the top 10 drugs sold worldwide in 2015 were antibody drugs. Since Hamers et al. found heavy chain antibodies with light chains naturally deleted in camel blood in 1993, Nanobody (Nb) has gradually replaced other small antibodies and become a hot spot in the development of new antibody drugs. Nb is usually only about 15 KDa, which is about one-tenth of the size of traditional antibodies. Nb has disulfide bonds inside, and a large number of hydrophilic residues on the surface, and thus has strong resistance to heat and pH. The properties of Nb lacking the Fc segments and light chains enable Nb to recognize cryptic or small epitopes that cannot be recognized by traditional antibodies and avoid complement reactions; in addition, single domain antibodies have many advantages, such as high stability, low toxicity, strong solubility, easy target screening, easy expression in prokaryotic microorganisms, and good economy. Sequence homology analysis showed that the VHH germline gene sequence of Camel Nb was highly homologous to human VH3, but CDR1 and CDR3 of the Camel Nb were slightly longer than that in human, and CDR3 bulged outward in the tertiary structure, suggesting higher specificity and affinity for antigen binding. In view of the above advantages, Nb is being gradually developed as a monoclonal antibody drug for disease diagnosis and treatment, and is widely used in the development of enzyme inhibitors, and tumor, infection, and inflammation biological inhibitors. However, the small size of the nanobody provides many advantages for its therapeutic function, but small molecular proteins are easily eliminated in vivo. Transforming Nb into target enzyme, transmembrane protein or bivalent by genetic engineering can effectively improve antibody activity and stability, so as to achieve the purpose of research. In studies on inhibition of viral replication, it was found that the bivalent nanobody was at least 60 times more effective than the monovalent nanobody and had a longer duration of action in animals, effectively delaying the time of death in animals. Antibody drugs have great prospects, but domestic antibody drugs are still in the initial stage.

Therefore, it is of far-reaching and positive significance to develop domestic PCSK9 antibody inhibitors to meet the urgent domestic needs of antibody drugs.

## SUMMARY

The present disclosure is based on the discovery and recognition of the inventors of the following facts and issues.

The development of PCSK9 antibodies in the related art focuses on murine traditional antibodies. However, traditional antibodies face difficulties in both mass expression and humanization, which are time-consuming and expensive, and the acquisition rate of effective antibodies is low, which seriously limits the development of PCSK9 antibody inhibitors. In particular, domestic antibody drugs are just in the early stage of development and cannot meet the needs of patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) at all.

According to the inventors of the present disclosure, camels were immunized with PCSK9 antigen, peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) of the immunized camels were collected to isolate PCSK9 affinity lymphocytes, total RNA was extracted, and the V region of the camel heavy chain antibody was cloned by Nest-PCR technology and inserted into a phage plasmid to construct a phage expression library. Then, the PCSK9 antigen was screened for multiple rounds by phage display technology. Finally, the screened high-affinity antibodies were expressed and purified in prokaryotic cells in large quantities to obtain single-domain antibodies, which were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to verify affinity and the binding constant. PCSK9 single domain antibodies with high affinity were successfully screened.

## DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS

The embodiments of the present disclosure are described below in detail. Examples of the embodiments are shown in the accompanying drawings. The same or similar numerals represent the same or similar elements or elements having the same or similar functions throughout the specification. The examples described below with reference to the accompanying drawings are illustrative, which are merely intended to explain the present disclosure, rather than to limit the present disclosure.

In describing the present disclosure, the terms used herein have been explained and illustrated merely to facilitate an understanding of the embodiments and are not to be construed as limiting the claimed solutions of the present disclosure.

Nanobody

As used herein, the term “nanobody” is a heavy chain antibody naturally lacking the light chain, found in camel blood, and including only the heavy chain (H chain) of a heavier molecular weight. Wherein, the amino-terminal (N-terminal) amino acid sequence of the peptide chain varies widely, and is referred to as a variable region (V region), and the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) is relatively stable and varies little and is referred to as a constant region (C region). The V region of the H chain is referred to as VH. Some regions in the variable region, which have a higher degree of variation in the amino acid composition and arrangement order, are referred to as hypervariable regions (HVR). The hypervariable region is a site where an antigen binds to the antibody and is therefore also referred to as a complementarity-determining region (CDR). The heavy chain variable region has three CDR regions. CDR1 and CDR3 of camels are slightly longer than that of humans, and CDR3 protrudes outward in the tertiary structure, so it was inferred that the single domain antibodies have higher antigen binding specificity and affinity than the traditional antibodies.

According to the present disclosure, camels were immunized with PCSK9 antigen expressed by CHO cells to obtain anti-PCSK9 nanobody (Nb) with high specificity and high affinity. The antibody can specifically bind to PCSK9 antigen, and thus the antibody can be used for targeted treatment or prevention of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides an antibody capable of specifically recognizing PCSK9 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, the antibody contains at least one CDR sequence selected from the heavy chain variable region CDR sequences SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 3 or an amino acid sequence with at least 95% identity to the at least one CDR sequence selected from the heavy chain variable region CDR sequences SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 3. In some other embodiments, the antibody or the antigen-binding fragment provided herein has conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the heavy chain described above. The “antigen-binding fragment” refers to an antibody fragment that retains the ability to specifically bind to antigen (PCSK9). The “conservative amino acid substitution” refers to a substitution of an amino acid by an residue of another amino acid that is biologically, chemically, or structurally similar. The “biologically similar” means that the substitution does not destroy the biological activity of the PCSK9 antibody or the biological activity to the PCSK9 antigen. The “structurally similar” means that the amino acids have side chains of similar lengthes, such as alanine, glycine, or serine, or have side chains of similar sizes. The “chemically similar” means that the amino acids have the same charge or are both hydrophilic or hydrophobic. For example, the hydrophobic residues isoleucine, valine, leucine, or methionine are substituted by each other. Alternatively, polar amino acids are used for substitution, such as arginine substituting lysine, glutamic acid substituting aspartic acid, glutamine substituting asparagine, and serine substituting threonine, etc.

In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment. The an antibody or antigen-binding fragment has a heavy chain variable region having an amino acid sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 25. The CDR regions (shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 3) of the heavy chain variable region sequence of the antibody described above can be obtained by the inventors through antibody sequence alignment databases (NCBI, IMGT). In some other embodiments, the heavy chain variable region sequence of the antibody or antigen binding fragment has conservative amino acid substitutions as compared with the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 25. Of course, these conservative amino acid substitutions do not alter the biological function of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment. In some embodiments, these conservative amino acid substitutions may occur to amino acids in the heavy chain variable region other than the CDR regions.

In some preferred embodiments, the present disclosure provides an anti-PCSK9 antibody having a heavy chain of an amino acid sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 27 to 36.

In some preferred embodiments, the present disclosure provides an anti-PCSK9 nanobody having a heavy chain variable region of an amino acid sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 17 to 25 or a heavy chain of an amino acid sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 28 to 36.

Nucleic Acid Molecule, Expression Vector, and Recombinant Cell

In preparing or obtaining such antibodies, nucleic acid molecules expressing such antibodies can be linked to different vectors and then expressed in different cells to obtain the corresponding antibodies.

To this end, the present disclosure further provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibody or the antigen-binding fragment as described above.

In some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule has a nucleotide sequence shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 37 to 46.

In some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule has at least 90%, preferably 95% or more, more preferably 98% or more, or 99% or more homology with the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 37 to 46. The sequences with homology with the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 37 to 46 can express amino acid sequences similar to SEQ ID NOs: 16 to 25, so that the sequences can specifically bind to PCSK9 antigen to realize the targeting function of the antibody.

The present disclosure further provides an expression vector including the isolated nucleic acid molecue as described above. When the isolated polynucleotide described above is linked to a vector, the polynucleotide may be linked directly or indirectly to control elements on the vector, as long as the control elements are capable of controlling the translation, expression, etc. of the polynucleotide. These control elements may of course be derived directly from the vector itself or may be exogenous, i.e., not derived from the vector itself. Of course, the polynucleotide may be operably linked to a control element. As used herein, “operably linked” means that the exogenous gene is linked to a vector such that control elements within the vector, such as transcription control sequences and translation control sequences, etc. are capable of performing their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the exogenous gene. Of course, the polynucleotides used to encode the heavy chain of the antibody may be each independently inserted into a different vector, typically inserted into the same vector. Commonly used vectors may be, for example, plasmids, phages, and the like. For example, the Plasmid-X plasmid is used.

The present disclosure further provides a recombinant cell containing the expression vector. The expression vector can be introduced into prokaryotic cells to construct recombinant cells that can then be used to express the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments according to the present disclosure. By culturing the recombinant cells, the corresponding antibodies can be obtained.

According to the present disclosure, eukaryotic expressed PCSK9 antigens were utilized to immunize camels to obtain a high quality PCSK9 immune nanobody library by flow cytometry sorting of affinity lymphocytes. The ELISA plate was coated with the PCSK9 antigen, the phage display technology was used to screen the antibody library of PCSK9 immune single domain antibodies, and then the screened single domain antibodies were transformed into E. coli expression systems for mass expression, so that the monoclonal single domain antibodies of PCSK9 with high affinity could be obtained in relatively short time.

Nine antibodies, VHH-Hu and VHH-Z 1 to VHH-Z 8 were designed independently according to the results of phage screening.

The immunization was conducted once a month for a total of 4 times; 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected from the camels at each immunization. The camel head was fixed to one side during blood collection. The hairs on the skin at the blood collection site of the animal were shaved first and disinfected with 75% alcohol, and blood was collected after the alcohol was dried. The jugular sulcus was pressed with fingers, after the blood vessels were distended, the blood collection site was disinfected and injected with needles for blood collection. 10 mL of blood was collected into a 15 mL EDTA anticoagulant tube, which was immediately and continuously shaken slowly, mixed thoroughly, placed on ice, and transported back to the laboratory.

d. The ProteinA affinity chromatography column was regenerated;

e. The sample was purified by desalting with a suitable buffer.

f. After sterile filtration of the purified sample, the retained sample was submitted for QC.

### Example 4 Determination of Affinity of PCSK9 Antibody

(1) Analysis of Affinity of PCSK9 Nanobody by ELISA Assay

100 ng of PCSK9 protein was used in the experimental group, non-induced plasmid-expressed protein was used in the control group, BSA was used to coat the ELISA plates, and the plates were incubated at 4° C. overnight. On the next day, 2% BSA was added to conducting blocking at room temperature for 1 h; the purified PCSK9 antibody was added into the control group and the experimental group, and PBS was added into the blank group, and the plates was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The plated was washed 10 times with PBST, secondary antibody was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h; the substrate was added to react 10 to 20 min and absorbance was read on a microplate reader. The results of ELISA assay (FIG. 6) showed that PCSK9 nanobody had good affinity for PCSK9, with the binding activity much higher than that in control group.

(2) SPR Analysis of Binding Constant for PCSK9 Nanobody

After the chip was activated, 500 nM PCSK9 antigen was added for reaction. The residual active carboxyl groups were washed off by adding 150 μL of 1M ethanolamine hydrochloride; after gradient dilution of PCSK9 antibody, 360 μL antibody was added at a rate of 25 μL/min for binding for 120 s and dissociating for 400 s; after obtaining the data, the results were processed and shown in FIGS. 7, 8, and 9 below, showing the signal intensity when the binding site of the antibody was occupied by the antigen, where KD (M) is the dissociation constant of the antigen-antibody interaction, indicating that each antibody of PCSK9 has good interaction with the PCSK9 antigen, and has the value for further development.

### Example 5 In Vitro Pharmacodynamic Validation of PCSK9 Antibody on Cancer Cell Model

The cultured Huh7 and HepG2 cells were plated in 96-well plates (Corning, USA) at a cell density of 5×105 cells/well (cells were resuspended with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum). The cells were cultured at 37° C. for 18 to 20 h, washed with D-PBS (Gibco, USA), and transferred to serum-free culture system. A total of five groups were designed for the experiment. The first group was blank control (without hPCSK9 and antibody). The second group was negative control (only hPCSK9 was added at a concentration of 0.08 μM. The hPCSK9 (at a concentration of 0.08 μM) protein and two other sets of antibodies (VHH-Z3 and VHH-Z3-Fc, at concentrations of 0.75 μM, 0.375 μM, and 1.5 μM, respectively), pre-heated to 37° C., were then added to the cells. The cells were cultured for 1 h at 37° C., 10 μL of LDL-BIODIPY (Invitrogen, USA) was added to the cells (at a concentration of 6 μg/mL) and the cells were further cultured for 3 h at 37° C. The culture solution was washed three times with D-PBS (Gibco brand, USA), and relative fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescence microplate reader M1000 PRO (Tecan, Switzerland). Fluorescence intensity can reflect the metabolic level of low density lipoprotein LDL. The results are shown in FIG. 10. In the two groups of hepatoma cell models, the addition of each of VHH4, VHH-Z3, and VHH-Z3-Fc antibodies blocked the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, thereby promoting the absorption of LDLC by LDLR on the cell surface.

### Example 6 In Vivo Pharmacodynamic Validation of the PCSK9 Antibody in Transgenic Rats

The animals for pharmacodynamic experiments were divided into seven groups with six rats in each group, among which five groups were hPCSK9 transgenic rats (Tg+rats) and two groups were normal control rats. hPCSK9 transgenic rats were obtained by randomly inserting the hPCSK9 gene into the genomes of zygotes of normal rats. Successfully transgenic rats were verified for the correct insertion of the hPCSK9 gene by PCR. These Tg+ rats developed hyperlipidemia symptoms after 8 weeks of high-fat diet induction. Of the five groups of transgenic rats, the first four groups continued on a high-fat diet and were injected with PBS, commercially available Repatha monoclonal antibody (Evolocumab), VHH-Z3, and VHH-Z3-Fc at the tail vein (injection dose of 20 mg/Kg), respectively. The four group were sequentially named as transgenic high-fat blank group, transgenic high-fat positive group, transgenic high-fat VHH-Z3 group, and transgenic high-fat VHH-Z3-Fc group, and the remaining group of transgenic rats was fed with normal diet. Two control groups of normal rats were also set, among which the first group was fed with non-transgenic normal diet, and the second group was fed with non-transgenic high-fat diet, injected with commercially available Repatha monoclonal antibody, and named as non-transgenic high-fat positive group. The rats were injected on days 0 to 7 and tested on day 19. Blood samples were collected, and levels of total cholesterol (CHOL) and liver low density lipoprotein were measured by an automated biochemical analyzer (Bs-600, Mindray, China), and the results are shown in FIG. 11. Compared with the control group, the hPCSK9 hyperlipidemia rats, after being administrated with positive drugs, had significantly reduced levels of CHOL and LDL-C, which maintained until the end of the experiment. The test drug VHH-Z3-Fc also significantly reduced levels of CHOL and LDL-C in hPCSK9 hyperlipidemic rat model, and the hypolipidemic effect was slightly better than that of the positive drug group between Day 2 and Day 13 after administration. There was no significant effect of test drug VHH-Z3 on the levels of CHOL and LDL-C in hPCSK9 hyperlipidemia rat model during the whole administration period.
