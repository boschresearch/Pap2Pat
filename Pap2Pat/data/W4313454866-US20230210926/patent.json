                                "Basic biological research, in vivo synthetic biology and the development of cell-based medicine require methods to visualize the functions of specific cells deep inside intact organisms. In this context, widely used optical techniques based on fluorescent and luminescent proteins have limited utility due to the scattering and absorption of light by tissue. In contrast, ultrasound is a widely used technique for deep-tissue imaging, providing sub-100 \u00b5m spatial resolution and penetrating several cm into tissue. The relative simplicity and low cost of ultrasound make it widely accessible for both research and clinical medicine, while recently developed super-resolution methods push its spatial resolution below 10 \u00b5m. Recently, the first genetically encodable reporters for ultrasound were introduced based on gas vesicles (GVs): air-filled protein nanostructures encoded by clusters of 8-20+ genes, which evolved as flotation devices in a wide range of mostly aquatic bacteria and archaea. The low density and high compressibility of their air-filled interiors compared to surrounding tissues allow GVs to scatter sound waves and thereby produce ultrasound contrast when heterologously expressed as acoustic reporter genes (ARGs) in genetically engineered bacteria or mammalian cells.",
                                "Despite the conceptual promise of first-generation ARGs, several limitations prevent their widespread use for monitoring bacterial or mammalian gene expression in vivo. First-generation bacterial ARGs cannot scatter ultrasound nonlinearly (making them difficult to distinguish from background tissues), express poorly at 37\u00b0 C., and are too metabolically burdensome for in situ expression in vivo. Likewise, first-generation mammalian ARGs also produced only linear contrast, and cell-to-cell variability in their expression and burden meant that they could only be imaged robustly with ultrasound in clonally selected cell lines stimulated with potent epigenetic reagents. In both cases, the lack of nonlinear signal had to be circumvented by destructive ultrasound pulse sequences, which destroyed the GVs and limited dynamic imaging. Just as the widespread use of fluorescent proteins did not take off until the development of enhanced versions of GFP, an analogous breakthrough is required for acoustic proteins to become widely useful in in vivo biological research and potential clinical applications.",
                                "There is a need for next-generation ARGs that, when expressed heterologously in either probiotic bacterial strains or mammalian cancer cell lines, can produce GVs with strong nonlinear ultrasound contrast and enable robust, sustained expression under physiological conditions. These qualities would enable long-term noninvasive imaging of gene expression in a broad range of in vivo applications."

Ultrasound imaging has the potential to address this challenge as a widely available technique with a tissue penetration of several centimeters and spatial resolution below 100 \u00b5m. Recently, the first genetically encoded acoustic reporters were developed based on bacterial gas vesicles to link ultrasound signals to molecular and cellular function in mammalian cells. However, the properties of these first-generation mammalian acoustic reporter genes (mARGs) resulted in limited sensitivity and specificity for imaging in the in vivo context. Herein are provided second-generation mARGs with greatly improved acoustic properties and expression characteristics, identified through a phylogenetic screen of candidate gene clusters from diverse bacteria and archaea. The resulting constructs offer major qualitative and quantitative improvements, including much stronger ultrasound contrast, the ability to produce nonlinear signals distinguishable from background tissue, and stable long-term expression.

The collapse pressure profile of a set type of GV is thus characterized by a mid-point pressure where 50% of the GVs of the set type have been collapsed (also known as the \u201cmidpoint collapse pressure\u201d), an initial collapse pressure where 5% or lower of the GVs of the type have been collapsed, and a complete collapse pressure where at least 95% of the GVs of the type have been collapsed. In some embodiments herein described a selectable critical collapse pressure can be any of these collapse pressures within a collapse pressure profile, as well as any point between them.

Ultrasound can refer to sound with frequencies higher than the audible limits of human beings, typically over 20 kHz. Ultrasound devices typically can range up to the gigahertz range of frequencies, with most medical ultrasound devices operating in the 1 to 18 MHz range. The amplitude of the waves relates to the intensity of the ultrasound, which in turn relates to the pressure created by the ultrasound waves. Applying ultrasound can be accomplished, for example, by sending strong, short electrical pulses to a piezoelectric transducer directed at the target. Ultrasound can be applied as a continuous wave, or as wave pulses as will be understood by a skilled person.",
                                "Accordingly, the wording \u201cultrasound imaging\u201d as used herein can refer to in particular to the use of high frequency sound waves, typically broadband waves in the megahertz range, to image structures in the body. The image can be up to 3D with ultrasound. In particular, ultrasound imaging typically involves the use of a small transducer (probe) transmitting highfrequency sound waves to a target site and collecting the sounds that bounce back from the target site to provide the collected sound to a computer using sound waves to create an image of the target site. Ultrasound imaging allows detection of the function of moving structures in real-time. Ultrasound imaging works on the principle that different structures/fluids in the target site will attenuate and return sound differently depending on their composition. A contrast agent sometimes used with ultrasound imaging are microbubbles created by an agitated saline solution, which works due to the drop in density at the interface between the gas in the bubbles and the surrounding fluid, which creates a strong ultrasound reflection. Ultrasound imaging can be performed with conventional ultrasound techniques and devices displaying 2D images as well as three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound that formats the sound wave data into 3-D images. In addition to 3D ultrasound imaging, ultrasound imaging also encompasses Doppler ultrasound imaging, which uses the Doppler Effect to measure and visualize movement, such as blood flow rates. Types of Doppler imaging includes continuous wave Doppler, where a continuous sinusoidal wave is used; pulsed wave Doppler, which uses pulsed waves transmitted at a constant repetition frequency, and color flow imaging, which uses the phase shift between pulses to determine velocity information which is given a false color (such as red=flow towards viewer and blue=flow away from viewer) superimposed on a grey-scale anatomical image. Ultrasound imaging can use linear or non-linear propagation depending on the signal level. Harmonic and harmonic transient ultrasound response imaging can be used for increased axial resolution, as harmonic waves are generated from non-linear distortions of the acoustic signal as the ultrasound waves insonate tissues in the body. Other ultrasound techniques and devices suitable to image a target site using ultrasound would be understood by a skilled person.",
                                "The basic physics of sound waves enables ultrasound to visualize biological tissues with high spatial and temporal resolution. This capability has been enhanced by the development of acoustic biomolecules \u2014proteins with physical properties enabling them to scatter sound. The first acoustic biomolecules developed as contrast agents in ultrasound imaging, analogous to GFPs used in optical imaging, were based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs). The advancement of GVs has made it possible to use ultrasound to visualize the functions of cells deep inside tissues.",
                                "The term \u201cultrasound\u201d can refer to sound with frequencies higher than the audible limits of human beings, typically over 20 kHz. Ultrasound devices typically can range up to the gigahertz range of frequencies, with most medical ultrasound devices operating in the 0.2 to 18 MHz range. The amplitude of the waves relates to the intensity of the ultrasound, which in turn relates to the pressure created by the ultrasound waves. Applying ultrasound can be accomplished, for example, by sending strong, short electrical pulses to a piezoelectric transducer directed at the target. Ultrasound can be applied as a continuous wave, or as wave pulses as will be understood by a person skilled in focused ultrasound. U.S. Pat. Application Publication No. 2020/0237346 describes methods comprising the application of a step function increase in acoustic pressure during ultrasound imaging using gas vesicle contrast, along with capturing successive frames of ultrasound imaging and extracting time-series vectors for pixels of the frames, the content of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and/or sixth US pulse(s) each comprise a set of pulses.",
                                "Focused ultrasound (\u201cFUS\u201d) can refer to the technology that uses ultrasound energy to target specific areas of a subject, such as a specific area of a brain or body. FUS focuses acoustic waves by employing concave transducers that usually have a single geometric focus, or an array of ultrasound transducer elements which are actuated in a spatiotemporal pattern such as to produce one or more focal zones. At this focus or foci most of the power is delivered during sonication in order to induce mechanical effects, thermal effects, or both. The frequencies used for focused ultrasound are in the range of 200 KHz to 8000 KHz.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201charmonic signal\u201d or \u201charmonic frequency\u201d can refer to a frequency in a periodic waveform that is an integer multiple of the frequency of the fundamental signal. In addition, this term encompasses sub-harmonic signals, which are signals with a frequency equal to an integral submultiple of the frequency of the fundamental signal. In ultrasound imaging, the transmitted pulse is typically centered around a fundamental frequency, and received signals may be processed to isolate signals centered around the fundamental frequency or one or more harmonic frequencies.",
                                "The term \u201cfundamental signal\u201d or \u201cfundamental wave\u201d can refer to the primary frequency of the transmitted ultrasound pulse. All GVs can backscatter ultrasound at the fundamental frequency, allowing their detection by ultrasound.",

The term \u201clinear signal\u201d can refer to a signal that does obey those properties. One example of non-linearity is the production of harmonic signals in response to ultrasound excitation at a certain fundamental frequency. Another example is a non-linear response to acoustic pressure. One embodiment of such a non-linearity is the acoustic collapse profile of GVs, in which there is a non-linear relationship between the applied pressure and the disappearance of subsequent ultrasound contrast from the GVs as they collapse. Another example of a non-linear signal that does not involve the destruction of GVs, is the increase in both fundamental and harmonic signals with increasing pressure of the transmitted imaging pulse, wherein certain GVs exhibit a super-linear relationship between these signals and the pulse pressure.",
                                "The term \u201capplying ultrasound\u201d shall be given its ordinary meaning, and shall also refer to sending ultrasound-range acoustic energy to a target. The sound energy produced by the piezoelectric transducer can be focused by beamforming, through transducer shape, lensing, or use of control pulses. The soundwave formed is transmitted to the body, then partially reflected or scattered by structures within a body; larger structures typically reflecting, and smaller structures typically scattering. The return sound energy reflected/scattered to the transducer vibrates the transducer and turns the return sound energy into electrical signals to be analyzed for imaging. The frequency and pressure of the input sound energy can be controlled and are selected based on the needs of the particular imaging/delivery task and, in some methods described herein, collapsing GVs. To create images, particularly 2D and 3D imaging, scanning techniques can be used where the ultrasound energy is applied in lines or slices which are composited into an image.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the method includes applying a set of imaging pulses from an ultrasound transmitter to the target site, and receiving ultrasound signal at a receiver. In certain instances, the ultrasound signal detected by the receiver includes an ultrasound echo signal. Additional information of ultrasound systems and methods can be found in related publications as will be understood by a person skilled in the art.",
                                "Methods for performing ultrasound imaging are known in the art and can be employed in methods of the current disclosure. In certain aspects, an ultrasound transducer, which comprises piezoelectric elements, transmits an ultrasound imaging signal (or pulse) in the direction of the target site. Variations in the acoustic impedance (or echogenicity) along the path of the ultrasound imaging signal causes backscatter (or echo) of the imaging signal, which is received by the piezoelectric elements. The received echo signal is digitized into ultrasound data and displayed as an ultrasound image. Conventional ultrasound imaging systems comprise an array of ultrasonic transducer elements that are used to transmit an ultrasound beam, or a composite of ultrasonic imaging signals that form a scan line. The ultrasound beam is focused onto a target site by adjusting the relative phase and amplitudes of the imaging signals. The imaging signals are reflected back from the target site and received at the transducer elements. The voltages produced at the receiving transducer elements are summed so that the net signal is indicative of the ultrasound energy reflected from a single focal point in the subject. An ultrasound image is then composed of multiple image scan lines.",

The ultrasound data can be obtained using a standard ultrasound device, or can be obtained using an ultrasound device configured to specifically detect the contrast agent used. Obtaining the ultrasound data can include detecting the ultrasound signal with an ultrasound detector. In some embodiments, the imaging step further comprises analyzing the set of ultrasound data to produce an ultrasound image.",

For example, an ultrasound data is obtained by applying to the target site an ultrasound signal at a transmit frequency from 4 to 11 MHz, or at a transmit frequency from 14 to 22 MHz. In some instances, the imaging frequency is selected so as to maximize the contrast generated by the administered contrast agent. In some embodiments, applying ultrasound (US) to the target site of the subject comprises applying US to a plurality of target sites of the subject.",

In some instances, the ultrasound pressure, including the collapsing ultrasound pressure and the imaging ultrasound pressure can be referred to as the \u201cpeak positive pressure\u201d of the ultrasound pulses. The term \u201cpeak positive pressure\u201d can refer to the maximum pressure amplitude of the positive pulse of a pressure wave, typically in terms of the difference between the peak pressure and the ambient pressure at the location in the person or specimen that is being imaged.",

                                "As provided and discussed above, there is a need for next-generation ARGs that, when expressed heterologously in either probiotic bacterial strains or mammalian cancer cell lines, can produce GVs with strong nonlinear ultrasound contrast and enable robust, sustained expression under physiological conditions. These qualities would enable long-term noninvasive imaging of gene expression in a broad range of in vivo applications. It was hypothesized that a genomic mining approach \u2013 previously applied to improving fluorescent proteins, opsins Cas proteins, and other biotechnology tools \u2013 would yield ARGs with improved properties, which could be further optimized through genetic engineering. By cloning and screening 15 distinct polycistronic operons from a diverse set of GV-expressing species representing a broad phylogeny, two GV gene clusters were identified - from Serratia sp. 39006 and Anabaena flos-aquae - that produce vastly more linear and nonlinear acoustic contrast than previously tested clusters when expressed in several types of bacteria and mammalian cells, respectively. The bacterial ARG adapted from Serratia sp. 39006 (bARGSer), when expressed in the widely used probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), enabled noninvasive ultrasound imaging of these probiotic agents colonizing tumors, providing direct visualization of the microscale in vivo distribution of this rapidly emerging class of anti-cancer therapy. The mammalian ARG adapted from A. flos-aquae (mARGAna), when expressed in human breast cancer cells, enabled both the noninvasive, in situ microscale imaging and long-term monitoring of heterologous gene expression in developing orthotopic tumors, and the ultrasound-guided biopsy of a genetically defined subpopulation of these tumor cells. The properties and performance of these second-generation ARGs represent a fundamental advance in the utility of acoustic proteins for a wide range of in vivo research.",

                                "GVs are encoded by polycistronic gene clusters comprising one or more copies of the primary structural gene gvpA and 7 to 20+ other genes encoding minor constituents, assembly factors or reinforcing proteins, which together help assemble the GVs\u2032 protein shells. Hundreds of organisms have GV genes in their genomes, but only a small subset have been shown to produce GVs. Given the labor involved in cloning and testing polycistronic clusters, the phylogenetic search was limited to organisms with confirmed GV production and sequenced operons. 11 representative species were selected, broadly sampling phylogenetic space, cluster architecture and organismal characteristics (i.e., halophilic, thermophilic and mesophilic) (FIG. 1A and FIG. 8). Each species was obtained from culture repositories, amplified GV operons from their genomes, and cloned them into a bacterial expression vector.",
                                "Each operon was then expressed in confluent E. coli patches at several temperatures and inducer concentrations (FIG. 1B), comparing them to two bacterial ARG constructs previously shown (Bourdeau et al. \u201cAcoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts.\u201d Nature 553.7686 (2018): 86-90) to work in E. coli - bARG1 (Anabaena flos-aquae/Bacillus megaterium hybrid ) and Bacillus megaterium \u0394gvpA-Q, as well as the full Bacillus megaterium gene cluster (FIGS. 1C-1G, FIGS. 9A-9E, FIGS. 10A-10C, FIGS. 11A-11B, FIGS. 12A-12D, FIGS. 13A-13B). These patches were scanned using a home-built robotic ultrasound imaging apparatus, applying a cross-propagating amplitude modulation pulse sequence (xAM). This pulse sequence enhances signals specific to nonlinear contrast agents such as GVs while cancelling linear background scattering. Importantly, unlike pulse sequences that relied on the irreversible collapse of GVs to obtain GV-specific contrast, xAM is nondestructive. In addition, the optical opacity of the patches was examined, which can be increased by sufficient levels of GV expression.",
                                "Of the 15 gene clusters tested, only 3 showed significant xAM signal when expressed at 37\u00b0 C., and 5 showed significant xAM signal at 30\u00b0 C. (FIGS. 1C-1E). Even though all operons tested are from organisms reported to produce GVs in their native hosts, only the A. flos-aquae, B. megaterium \u0394gvpA-Q, bARG1, Desulfobacterium vacuolatum, and Serratia sp. 39006 (Serratia) clusters produced detectable GVs heterologously in E. coli. Several other operons produced a small amount of ultrasound contrast under certain conditions, which did not arise from GV expression but reflected a rough patch morphology likely due to cellular toxicity (FIG. 10D). The failure of most tested gene clusters to produce GVs in E. coli is not surprising given the complexity of polycistronic heterologous expression, which requires each component to fold and function properly in a new host with a potentially different cytoplasmic environment, growth temperature and turgor pressure. In addition, it is possible that some genes included in the clusters act as cis-regulators, limiting expression absent a specific trans input, or that some additional genes are required beyond the annotated operons.",
                                "In patch format, the strongest acoustic performance was observed with the genes from Serratia, bARG1, A. flos-aquae, B. megateriaum, and D. vacuolatum. Because patch experiments do not control for the density of cells in each sample, the performance of these clusters in resuspended samples was further compared. Each operon was expressed on solid media at 30\u00b0 C. \u2013a temperature at which all five operons produced GVs \u2013 then scraped, resuspended, and normalized for cell concentration. These samples were imaged in hydrogels using both xAM (FIGS. 1F-1G and FIGS. 14A-14B) and a more sensitive but destructive imaging method called BURST (FIG. 14C), and examined optically with phase-contrast microscopy (PCM), which reveals the presence of GVs due to the refractive index difference between GVs and water (FIG. 14D). Three of the clusters produced xAM signals, and all clusters produced BURST signals significantly stronger than the negative control. All clusters except A. flos-aquae exhibited sufficient GV expression to be visible by PCM.",
                                "Cells expressing the Serratia cluster produced the strongest ultrasound signals, 19.2 dB above the next brightest cluster, bARG1, under xAM imaging at an applied acoustic pressure of 1.74 MPa: an 83-fold gain in signal intensity (FIG. 1F). Additionally, PCM images (FIG. 14D) showed that cells expressing the Serratia cluster had the highest levels of GV expression, as also seen in whole-cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FIG. 14E). Based on the large improvement in ultrasound contrast provided by the Serratia GV operon relative to the other gene clusters, this operon was selected for further optimization as a second-generation bacterial ARG.",
                                "Because overexpression of any protein imposes a metabolic demand on the host cell, it was reasoned that deletion of non-essential genes could improve GV expression from the Serratia cluster, and therefore the xAM signal. Previous work showed that deletions of gvpC, gvpW, gvpX, gvpY, gvpH, or gvpZ preserve GV formation in the native organism. These deletions were tested, as well as the deletion of an unannotated hypothetical protein (Ser39006_001280) encoded between the gvpC and gvpN coding sequences (FIG. 15A). When expressed in E. coli, deletions of gvpC, gvpH, gvpW, gvpY, or gvpZ reduced or eliminated xAM signal (FIGS. 15B-15C) and patch opacity (FIG. 15D). Deletion of gvpX increased xAM signal but decreased opacity, and deletion of Ser39006_001280 increased both xAM signal and opacity. Based on these results, the Serratia \u0394Ser39006_001280 operon was selected for subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments. This new genetic construct was called bARGSer - a bacterial acoustic reporter gene derived from Serratia.",

                                "bARGser was transferred into EcN, a strain of E. coli that is widely used in in vivo biotechnology applications due to its ability to persist in the gastrointestinal tract and colonize tumors. EcN has been intensely investigated as a chassis for anti-tumor therapy delivery, and is currently the most commonly used species in this application. Three different inducible promoter architectures were first tested in EcN on solid media at 37\u00b0 C., examining xAM ultrasound contrast and patch opacity as a function of inducer concentration. It was found that the L-arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter provided the most robust control over GV expression without obvious burden (FIGS. 2A-2B, FIGS. 16A-16D). Based on these results, the pBAD-bARGser EcN strain was selected for subsequent experiments.",
                                "To ensure that the pBAD-bARGser plasmid is maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection, as required in certain in vivo applications, the toxin-antitoxin stability cassette Axe-Txe was added. This enabled the pBAD-bARGser-AxeTxe plasmid to be maintained in EcN for up to 5 days of daily sub-culturing in liquid media without antibiotics, both with and without induction of ARG expression (FIG. 2C).",
                                "The expression of most heterologous genes, including widely used reporter genes such as fluorescent proteins (FPs), results in some degree of metabolic burden on engineered cells. Consistent with this expectation, the induction of pBAD-bARGser EcN resulted in reduced colony formation to an extent similar to the expression of a FP (FIG. 2D and FIG. 17A), even as the culture density measured by OD600 remained relatively unchanged (FIG. 2E and FIG. 17B). When the OD600 was measured after inducing cultures with L-arabinose, the growth curves of bARGSer-expressing and FP-expressing EcN were indistinguishable during the growth phase (0 to 5 hours), indicating that the two strains have similar growth rates (FIG. 2F). Collectively, these results suggest that overexpression of bARGSer using the pBAD expression system in EcN is not significantly more burdensome than that of FPs, which are widely accepted as relatively non-perturbative indicators of cellular function.",
                                "To further examine the genetic stability of bARGser constructs, cells were plated from daily sub-cultures onto agar with 0.1% (w/v) L-arabinose and examined colony opacity (FIG. 2G) as a measure of retained GV expression. Of a total of 3824 colonies, nearly all were opaque (FIG. 2G), with GV expression confirmed by PCM and TEM (FIGS. 2H-2I). Only 11 colonies (<0.3% after ~35 cell generations) exhibited a reduced opacity (FIG. 18A), representing a mutated phenotype confirmed by growing these cells on fresh media (FIG. 18B). PCM revealed that these rare mutants still produced GVs, but at lower levels than non-mutants. These results indicate that mutational inactivation of GV production is not a major issue for pBAD-bARGSer-AxeTxe EcN under typical conditions.",
                                "After establishing construct stability, the acoustic properties of bARGser-expressing EcN were characterized. For cells induced in liquid culture with 0.1% L-arabinose for 24 hours and suspended at 109 cells/mL in agarose phantoms, an xAM signal was detected at acoustic pressures above 0.72 MPa, rising with increasing pressure up to the tested maximum of 1.74 MPa (FIG. 3A). To characterize the physical stability of GVs in these cells during ultrasound exposure, the xAM signal was measured over time at a series of increasing acoustic pressures (FIG. 3B and FIGS. 19A-19C). The xAM signal was steady at pressures up to 0.96 MPa, above which a slow decrease was observed, indicating that some of the GVs gradually collapsed despite sustained high xAM signals. The cells were also imaged with parabolic pulses, which can transmit higher pressures than xAM, and thus can be helpful in vivo to compensate for attenuation at tissue interfaces. When imaged with parabolic B-mode at varying acoustic pressures, the GVs started to collapse slowly at 1.02 MPa and more rapidly at 1.33 MPa and above (FIG. 3C). Based on these results, an acoustic pressure of 1.29 MPa was selected for xAM and 1.02 MPa for parabolic AM (pAM) imaging in subsequent experiments to obtain the strongest signals while minimizing GV collapse.",
                                "Next, to characterize the dynamics and inducibility of bARGser in EcN and determine the ultrasound detection limit of bARGser-expressing EcN, xAM signal was measured as a function of induction time, inducer concentration, and cell concentration. At a density of 109 cells/mL, xAM signal could first be observed 7 hours after induction with 0.1% L-arabinose and leveled off by 9 hours post-induction (FIGS. 3D-3E). Keeping the induction time constant at 24 hours while varying the L-arabinose concentration, GV expression was detected with as little as 0.001% L-arabinose, and the highest ultrasound signal was observed for 0.1-1% L-arabinose (FIGS. 3F-3G). When cells induced for 24 hours with 0.1% L-arabinose were diluted, they were detectable by ultrasound down to 107 cells/mL (FIGS. 3H-3I). Critically, this detection was achieved non-destructively with nonlinear imaging, compared to previous bacterial ARGs, which required a destructive linear imaging approach. The bARGSer xAM signal was proportional to the cell concentration between 107 cells/mL and 2 \u00d7 109 cells/mL (FIGS. 3H-3I). The cells were also imaged using BURST imaging, which provides greater sensitivity at the cost of collapsing the GVs. BURST enabled bARGser-expressing EcN to be detected as early as 3 hours post-induction (FIGS. 20A-20B), with as little as 0.001% L-arabinose FIGS. 20C-20D), and at a density as low as 105 cells/mL (FIGS. 20E-20F). Taken together, in vitro experiments provided herein indicated that the reporter gene construct pBAD-bARGser-AxeTxe is robust and stable in EcN and enables gene expression in these cells to be imaged with high contrast and sensitivity.",
                                "To test whether this ARG construct can function in other bacterial species, pBAD-bARGSer-AxeTxe was transformed into an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which has been used in bacterial anti-tumor therapies. After inducing expression with L-arabinose, S. Typhimurium cells produced GVs, as observed with PCM (FIG. 21A), and generated strong contrast in xAM imaging (FIGS. 21B-21C). S. Typhimurium cells exhibited similar detection limits to EcN with both xAM and BURST imaging (FIGS. 21D-21K).",

                                "Tumor-homing bacteria are a major emerging class of cancer therapy, taking advantage of the ability of cells such as EcN to infiltrate tumors and proliferate in their immunosuppressed microenvironment. Major synthetic biology efforts have been undertaken to turn tumor-homing EcN cells into effective therapies for solid tumors. However, despite the promise of this technology and the importance of appropriate microscale biodistribution of the bacteria inside tumors, no effective methods currently exist to visualize this biodistribution in situ in living animals.",
                                "To test the ability of bARGser to overcome this limitation, subcutaneous MC26 tumors were formed in mice and, when the tumors reached a substantial size, intravenously injected EcN cells containing the pBAD-bARGser-AxeTxe plasmid, giving the bacteria 3 days to home to and colonize the tumors. GV expression was then induced and imaged the tumors with ultrasound (FIG. 4A). In all tumors colonized by bARGser-expressing EcN, pAM, BURST, and xAM ultrasound contrast were observed one day after induction with L-arabinose (FIG. 4B and FIG. 22A). The signals were localized to the core of the tumor and concentrated at the interface between live and necrotic tissue, where the EcN primarily colonized, as confirmed with subsequent tissue histology (FIGS. 4F-4I and FIG. 23). This biodistribution reflects the immune-privileged environment of the necrotic tumor core and has been observed previously only with post-mortem ex vivo optical methods.",
                                "Furthermore, after applying 3 MPa of acoustic pressure throughout the tumor to collapse all the GVs, re-injecting the mice with L-arabinose inducer, and allowing \u226524 hours for re-expression, similar ultrasound signals were observed in all tumors colonized by bARGser-expressing EcN (FIG. 4C and FIG. 22B). This result shows that bARGser can be used to visualize dynamic gene expression at multiple timepoints. Absent L-arabinose induction, no xAM or pAM ultrasound signals were observed from bARGSer-containing EcN (FIG. 4D and FIG. 22C); likewise, no xAM or pAM ultrasound signals were seen in tumors colonized by FP-expressing EcN (FIG. 4E, FIG. 4J and FIGS. 22D-22E). Low levels of BURST signal were observed in uninduced animals (FIG. 4K), likely due to small amounts of L-arabinose present in the diet combined with BURST imaging\u2019s high sensitivity.",
                                "To quantify tumor colonization, at the end of the experiment (day 20 in FIG. 4A) all mice were euthanized and their tumors were homogenized and plated on selective media. Tumors from all groups of mice (n=5 for induced and re-expressed bARGser, n=5 for uninduced bARGSer, and n=5 for FP) contained more than 7 \u00d7 108 CFU/g tissue (FIG. 4L), indicating that the EcN can persist at high levels in tumors for at least 6 days after IV injection regardless of bARGser expression, collapse, and re-expression. The somewhat higher density of FP-expressing EcN suggested that maintenance of the smaller pBAD-FP-AxeTxe plasmid (7.2 kb versus 23.2 kb for pBAD-bARGSer-AxeTxe), which would impose less burden on the cell, may be easier in this in vivo context where oxygen and other nutrients are limited. Negligible mutational silencing was observed in EcN plated from tumor samples (FIGS. 24A-24C).",
                                "Taken together, disclosed in vivo experiments with EcN demonstrate that bARGSer expression enables stable, non-destructive acoustic visualization of the microscale distribution of these probiotic agents in a therapeutically relevant context.",

                                "Having developed second-generation ARGs for use in bacteria, the same was attempted for mammalian cells. The first-generation mammalian ARGs were based on the GV gene cluster from B. megaterium (referred to here as mARGMega). mARGMega expression could only be detected with destructive collapse-based imaging due to a low level of GV expression and the lack of nonlinear contrast from the resulting GVs. Moreover, successful use of mARGMega as a reporter gene required monoclonal selection of transduced cells and their treatment with a broadly-acting histone deacetylase inhibitor. Seeking mARGs that are expressed more robustly and produce nonlinear signal, mammalian versions of the genes contained in each of the three clusters that produced nonlinear signal in E. coli at 37\u00b0 C. were cloned: Serratia, A. flos-aquae, and A. flos-aquae/B. megaterium (FIGS. 1D-1E). Equimolar transient cotransfections of the monocistronic genes derived from each gene cluster into HEK293T cells yielded detectable BURST signal only for the A. flos-aquae gene cluster and the positive control mARGMega (FIGS. 5A-5B \u201c1-fold excess\u201d).",
                                "Given the multiple gvpA copies contained in the native A. flos-aquae GV operon, it was hypothesized that expressing the major structural protein GvpA at a higher stoichiometry relative to the other genes in this cluster could improve GV expression. To test this possibility, the amount of gvpA plasmid in the A. flos-aquae plasmid set was titrated, while keeping the DNA amount corresponding to other genes constant (the total DNA level was also kept constant with a padding vector). It was found that the BURST signal increased monotonically with increasing gvpA up to 8-fold gvpA excess (FIG. 5B). In contrast, the signal peaked at 2-fold excess of the homologous structural protein gvpB when expressing the B. megaterium cluster, possibly due to unincorporated or unchaperoned GvpB monomers, which may burden the cells. That this does not happen with the genes from A. flos-aquae within the range tested suggests that the assembly factors in this gene cluster may be more efficient at utilizing GvpA to form gas vesicles or that GvpA may pose less of a burden than GvpB. To further improve GvpA expression, the gvpA transcript was stabilized with WPRE-hGH poly(A) elements, which resulted in peak signal at lower gvpA:chaperone ratios (FIGS. 25A-25B).",
                                "It was next examined if nonlinear ultrasound contrast could be observed from A. flos-aquae GVs to enable their discrimination from background. GvpC is a minor structural protein in A. flos-aquae GVs that binds to and mechanically reinforces the GV shell (FIG. 5C). Previously, in vitro chemical removal of GvpC from purified GVs was shown to enhance nonlinear ultrasound scattering by allowing the GVs to deform more strongly in response to acoustic pressure. When gvpC was omitted from the disclosed mammalian co-transfection mixture, a dramatic enhancement of nonlinear signal was observed in xAM imaging, with the peak signal achieved at around 0.6 MPa (FIG. 5D). By comparison, transfections including gvpC produced a much weaker xAM signal, while B. megaterium plasmids and GFP-expressing cells did not produce appreciable nonlinear contrast at any pressure. The omission of gvpC did not appreciably alter BURST contrast (FIG. 25C). These results indicate that the mammalian GVs derived from A. flos-aquae can provide strong, nondestructive, nonlinear ultrasound contrast.",
                                "To create a convenient vector for mammalian expression of A. flos-aquae GVs, a polycistronic plasmid was constructed linking the assembly factor genes gvpNJKFGWV through P2A co-translational cleavage elements. gvpA was supplied on a separate plasmid to enable stoichiometric tuning. The gvpA and gvpNJKFGWV plasmids were labeled with IRES-BFP and P2A-GFP, respectively, to allow for fluorescent analysis and sorting. Both transcripts were driven by CMV promoters and stabilized by WPRE-hGH poly(A) elements. This pair of plasmids was termed mARGAna: mammalian ARGs adapted from A. flos-aquae (FIG. 5E). mARGAna produced robust GV expression and ultrasound contrast in HEK293T cells transiently co-transfected with a 1-to 6-fold molar excess of gvpA (FIG. 5F).",
                                "One of the most promising applications of mammalian reporter genes is the visualization of tumor growth in animal models of cancer, which are a critical platform for basic oncology research and the development of new therapeutics. To produce a stable cancer cell line expressing mARGAna, the disclosed polycistronic constructs were cloned into PiggyBac integration plasmids under a doxycycline-inducible TRE promoter. As a clinically relevant cancer model, the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was chosen, which is widely used in tumor xenograft studies. These cells were engineered to constitutively co-express the rtTA transactivator and Antares optical reporter, then electrically transduced them with a mixture of mARGAna and PiggyBac transposase plasmids at a 2:1 (gvpA:gvpNJKFGWV) molar ratio, and fluorescently sorted for co-expression of Antares, GFP and BFP (FIG. 5G and FIG. 25D).",
                                "The resulting polyclonal MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells showed xAM contrast after a single day of doxycycline induction, which increased substantially through day 6 (FIG. 5H). The expression of GVs in these cells was confirmed by electron microscopy (FIG. 25E). The ultrasound signal increased steeply with increasing doxycycline doses up to 1 \u00b5g/mL, above which the signal saturated (FIG. 5I). xAM signal was detected from induced cells starting from an acoustic pressure of 0.31 MPa, whereas uninduced control cells did not produce signal at any pressure (FIG. 5J). At pressures above 0.42 kPa, the xAM signal gradually decreased over time, indicating the partial collapse of GVs. 0.42 MPa was chosen as the xAM imaging pressure for subsequent experiments, providing the optimal balance of signal stability and signal strength.",
                                "To test whether second-generation mammalian ARGs generalize beyond HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells, mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and human HuH7 hepatocytes were also engineered to express the mARGAna operon. Both cell types showed excellent xAM contrast, providing a similar xAM detection sensitivity as MDA cells (FIG. 5K, FIG. 25F). At 300k cells/mL for MDA-MB-231 and 3T3, and at 30k cells/mL for HuH7, the detection limit surpassed the reported destructive imaging sensitivity of first-generation mARGmega by one and two orders of magnitude respectively. With BURST imaging, mARGAna cells could be detected still more sensitively, at concentrations down to 3,000 cells/mL for 3T3-mARGAna and 30,000 cells/mL for MDA-MB-231-mARGAna and HuH7- mARGAna (FIG. 25G).",

                                "The ability of mARGAna to reveal the spatial distribution of gene expression in tumor xenografts in living mice was next tested. Orthotopic tumors were formed by injecting MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells bilaterally in the fourth mammary fat pads of female immunocompromised mice. The mice were then split into doxycycline-induced and uninduced groups. Ultrasound images of the tumors were acquired as they grew, with 3 imaging sessions distributed over 12 days (FIG. 6A). All induced tumors produced bright and specific xAM contrast starting from the first timepoint (day 4), whereas the uninduced tumors did not (FIG. 6B). The acquisition of adjacent planes allowed 3D visualization of expression patterns (data not shown). The nonlinear xAM signal was highly specific to the viable tumor cells, being absent outside the anatomically visible tumor boundaries and within the cores of the larger tumors imaged at 8 and 12 days. The observed spatial pattern of gene expression in these tumors was corroborated by fluorescence microscopy of formalin-fixed tumor sections obtained from euthanized mice on day 12 (FIG. 6C, FIGS. 26A-26C), confirming the ability of mARGAna to report microscale patterns of gene expression noninvasively in living animals. In contrast, in vivo fluorescence images of the mice lacked information about the spatial distribution of gene expression within the tumor (FIG. 6D). GV was quantified expression over time as a volumetric sum of xAM signal over all acquired image planes (FIG. 6E). The induced tumors had significantly higher total signal than the uninduced controls at all time points. These experiments demonstrate the ability of mARGAna to serve as a highly effective reporter gene for the noninvasive monitoring of tumor growth and gene expression.",
                                "The primary advantage of ultrasound imaging over optical methods is deeper penetration. To ensure that mARGAna expression can be detected in deep tissue beyond what can be easily shown in mice, MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells were imaged using xAM through a slab of beef liver thicker than 1 cm. As expected, the MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells were readily detectable (FIG. 26B). Moreover, this xAM signal was highly specific to MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells, and did not appear in the ARG-negative liver tissue (FIG. 26C).",

                                "One of the most common uses of ultrasound in biological research and medicine is to spatially guide procedures such as biopsies. By enabling non-destructive imaging, second-generation mARGs create the possibility for such procedures to be targeted based on in vivo gene expression patterns. Notably, because real-time procedure guidance requires dynamic non-destructive imaging, such guidance was not possible with previous ARGs. To demonstrate this concept, ultrasound-guided biopsies were performed on chimeric tumors created by making adjacent subcutaneous injections of MDA-MB-231-mARGAna cells and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing Antares (FIG. 7A). The chimeric composition of these tumors was visualized by obtaining 3D tomograms of the tumor mass (data not shown). Fine needle aspiration biopsies were then performed targeting either the xAM-positive or the xAM-negative regions of each tumor (FIG. 7B, data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of dissociated biopsy samples showed a very high correlation between mARGAna-positive (GFP-positive) cells that were sampled from xAM-positive regions and vice versa (FIG. 7C, FIG. 27). These results demonstrate that mARGAna expression enables genetically targeted in vivo procedures under ultrasound guidance.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "These results establish two second-generation ARG constructs \u2013 bARGser and mARGAna \u2013 that provide unprecedented, real-time ultrasound detection sensitivity and specificity when expressed in bacteria and mammalian cells. These gene clusters, obtained through a systematic phylogenetic screen and optimized through genetic engineering, produce bright nonlinear ultrasound signal when expressed in situ in tumors, either by bacterial agents colonizing the necrotic core of a tumor, or by the tumor cells themselves. When imaged using a highly sensitive and specific non-destructive ultrasound imaging paradigm, this nonlinear signal enables real-time monitoring of the precise locations and transcriptional activities of these cells and is sufficiently stable to image cellular biodistribution and gene expression over multiple days. Furthermore, real-time nondestructive imaging of ARGs enables ultrasound-guided procedures such as biopsies to target genetically defined cells.",
                                "These results comprise a major advance over previous work on heterologous GV expression in bacterial and mammalian cells. Previous bARG constructs required the host bacteria to be cultured and pre-express GVs under ideal laboratory conditions before in vivo injection, while the previous mARG construct only produced ultrasound contrast when expressed in a sorted monoclonal cell line treated with a global epigenetic activator. In both cases, sensitive and specific detection of these cells relied on destructive imaging methods that produce one-time contrast, hindering their use in monitoring dynamic biological processes or guiding real-time interventions.",
                                "With these major improvements, it is anticipated that these new ARGs will be useful for many applications that demand the noninvasive imaging of cells deep inside the body. bARGs can be used to track therapeutic bacteria as they home to and proliferate in tumors or other target organs. The distribution of the bacteria in the tumor provides a critical readout of whether the therapy is working as designed or needs to be adjusted or re-administered (for example, when the tumor is only partially colonized). In addition, the spatial distribution is important in guiding focused energy procedures applied to the cells, such as focused ultrasound. Other applications provided herein include the study of the gastrointestinal (GI) icrobiome and the tracking of probiotics designed to diagnose or treat GI conditions. In these applications, luminescence imaging would provide limited in vivo resolution due to light scattering, and would be difficult to scale to larger animals or human patients.",
                                "Second-generation mARGs provided herein can be used in biological research to visualize the growth and viability of tissues such as tumors and sample their contents with ultrasound-guided procedures. Similar approaches can be applied to study the immune system, the brain and organismal development, where the mARGs could be expressed constitutively or under phenotype-dependent promoters. In addition, mARG expression provided herein can enable the tracking of therapeutic mammalian cells, such as T-cells, stem cells and transplants analogously to the imaging of bacterial agents demonstrated in this study, and provide a means to target these therapeutic cells for biopsies and other image-guided interventions. Moreover, the fact that the new mARGs are based on A. flos-aquae GVs creates a connection between mammalian expression and molecular engineering, including the development of acoustic biosensors to monitor more dynamic cellular signals such as enzyme activity.",
                                "The envisioned applications of both bacterial and mammalian ARGs will benefit from the relative simplicity and low cost of ultrasound compared to other non-invasive techniques such as nuclear imaging and MRI, while providing in vivo resolution and potential for human translatability beyond what is currently possible with optical methods.",
                                "While these results represent an important step in the development of ARGs, additional improvements are provided herein which further expand their utility in biotechnology. First, in some embodiments, the expression kinetics of ARGs are slower than those of fluorescent proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells, and faster expression would facilitate the imaging of more dynamic genetic outputs. However, there are numerous scenarios in which expression kinetics on the order of one day are acceptable. For example, the processes of tumor growth and tumor infiltration by therapeutic cells are adequately captured, as shown in this study. Additional examples include inflammation, mammalian development, and stem cell expansion and migration. To enable a broader range of applications, the kinetics of ARG expression can be accelerated through further genetic engineering as described herein, for example by pre-expressing certain genes in the ARG cluster (e.g., the assembly factors) and conditionally expressing the remaining genes (e.g., the structural proteins). Second, the ability to multiplex different \u201ccolors\u201d of ARGs nondestructively in vivo can enable discrimination between different strains of engineered bacteria in a consortium, between different mammalian cell types in a tissue, or between bacterial and mammalian cells in close proximity, such as in a bacterially-colonized tumor. Third, the Serratia GV gene cluster is relatively large, making it more challenging to clone and incorporate with other genetic elements. As provided herein, the engineering of a shorter cluster with similar acoustic properties would simplify these efforts. Similarly, the current mARGAna cluster is delivered using two polycistronic plasmids; consolidating this cluster into a single plasmid, as described herein, can increase transfection efficiency, and shortening it could facilitate its viral packaging and delivery to endogenous cells in situ. Fourth, in some embodiments, the potentially burdensome effects of large plasmid size and ARG expression on cellular metabolism may be more pronounced in vivo than in vitro under ideal growth and expression conditions (FIGS. 2A-2I, FIGS. 5H-5I, FIGS. 15A-15F, FIGS. 16A-16D, FIGS. 17A-17B, FIGS. 18A-18B). While the in vivo expression of both bARGser (FIGS. 4A-4L) and mARGAna (FIGS. 6A-6E) yielded strong and specific ultrasound signals without obvious effects on cell migration and growth, strategies to reduce construct size and tightly regulate ARG expression are described herein and can become more important depending on the ARG application embodiment. The ability of second-generation ARGs, demonstrated here, to function in cells from two different mammalian species and two different bacterial species, is an encouraging sign for their broader utility.",
                                "The phylogenetic screening approach was successful in identifying bARGser and mARGAna as greatly improved ARGs. However, out of practical necessity, this screen subsampled the available phylogenetic space, and testing additional GV-encoding gene clusters could reveal ARGs with new or further-improved properties. Improvements can also be made in the screening strategy. It is challenging to identify all the gvp genes in a given genome (see Methods), and there is considerable regulation of GV cluster transcription by factors inside or outside the clusters. Therefore, in a given cloned cluster, it is possible that either essential genes are missing or cryptic regulatory elements are included. These issues could be resolved by synthesizing multiple versions of each putative gene cluster and screening a larger number of them in higher throughput. Even with optimal genetic constructs, it is likely that gene clusters from some species will not successfully form GVs in a given heterologous host due to differences in growth temperature, turgor pressure or the presence or absence of specific host factors. The phylogenetic screening strategy used in this study could thus be adapted to find optimal ARGs for use in other species of interest.",
                                "Just as improvements to and adaptations of fluorescent proteins enabled a wide range of microscopy applications that were mere speculations when GFP was first harnessed as a biotechnology, the systematic development of next-generation ARGs will help bring to reality the promise of sensitive, high-resolution noninvasive imaging of cellular function inside intact mammals."

In a second cloning step, a copy of GvpA2 was added to the cloned cluster. While we were able to PCR GvpA2 from the genome, it was not contiguous with the rest of the cluster. Therefore, and without being bound by any particular theory, it is possible that either there was an error in the assembly of the genome sequence (likely caused by the high sequence similarity of the GvpA genes), or that the genotype of the disclosed strain differs slightly from that of the strain sequenced."

These cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hr, and 150 uL was inoculated into larger 1.5 mL LB cultures containing 100 ug/mL kanamycin and 1% (w/v) glucose (for catabolite repression of the BL21(DE3) PlacUV5 promoter) in a deep-well 96-well plate and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30\u00b0 C. Square dual-layer LB agar plates were prepared as described previously, with varying concentrations of IPTG and 100 ug/mL kanamycin in the bottom layer, and 1% (w/v) glucose and 100 ug/mL kanamycin in the top layer. LB agar was incubated at 60\u00b0 C. for 12-36 hr after dissolution to allow it to degas. After the agar solidified, plates were dried at 37\u00b0 C. to remove all condensation on the top layer that would cause the bacterial patches to run together. A multichannel pipette was used to thoroughly mix overnight cultures and drop 1 \u00b5L of each culture onto the surface of the dual-layer plates, with care taken to avoid puncturing the agar which results in artifacts during ultrasound scans. Importantly, low-retention pipette tips were used, as it was found that the small volumes of culture would wet the outsides of standard pipette tips, resulting in inaccurate volume dispensing. Patches were allowed to dry completely before plates were flipped and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hr or 30\u00b0 C. for 48 hr.",

The night before expression experiments, glycerol stocks were used to inoculate overnight cultures (2 mL LB medium with the appropriate antibiotic and 1% (w/v) glucose) which were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and shaken at 250 rpm.

Plates were allowed to dry, and then inverted and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours before imaging with ultrasound.

Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm until reaching at OD600 of 0.1 - 0.3. At this point, cultures were induced by addition of L-arabinose and placed back at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm.

For L-arabinose titration experiments, L-arabinose concentrations ranging from 0 to 1% (w/v) were used for induction, and cultures were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm after addition of L-arabinose before ultrasound imaging. For cell concentration titration experiments, cultures were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm after addition of 0.1% (w/v) L-arabinose before ultrasound imaging.

Image acquisition was performed using a custom imaging script with a 64-ray-lines protocol and a synthetic aperture of 65 elements. The transmit waveform was set to a voltage of 50 V and a frequency of 10 MHz, with 1 waveform cycle and 67% intra-pulse duty cycle. In xAM mode, a custom sequence detailed previously was used with an angle of 19.5\u00b0. RF data from 4 repeated acquisitions was coherently averaged prior to beamforming for each image plane.",
                                "Agar plates containing bacterial patches were coated with a thin layer of LB agar and immersed in PBS to allow acoustic coupling to the L10-4v transducer. The transducer was connected to a BiSlide computer-controlled 3D translatable stage (Velmex) and positioned above the plane of the plate at an angle of 15\u00b0 from the vertical (to minimize specular reflection from the plastic dishes and agar) and a distance of 20 mm from the bacterial patches. The imaging sequence was applied sequentially to acquire image planes covering the full area of all plates. A custom script was used to automate the scan by controlling the motor stage in tandem with the ultrasound system, translating 0.5 mm in the azimuthal direction between rows and 19.5 mm in the lateral direction between columns. In the case of differential imaging scans, the full scan sequence was repeated after returning the motor stage to its origin and adjusting the voltage of the transducer.",
                                "For image processing and analysis, custom beamforming scripts were applied on-line to reconstruct image planes from the acquired RF data at each location. The intensity data for each plane was saved for off-line processing. All image planes were concatenated to form a 3D volume with all plates and colonies. A 2D image of the colonies was extracted from the 3D volume by taking the maximum intensity over a manually-defined depth range for all voxel columns. 2D differential images were obtained by subtracting the post-collapse 2D image from the pre-collapse 2D image. Bacterial patch intensities were then quantified from these 2D images. Sample ROIs were drawn around the center of each patch to avoid artefacts from the edges, and background ROIs were drawn around representative regions without patches. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) was calculated as the mean pixel intensity of the sample ROI divided by the mean pixel intensity of the background. Conversion to decibels (dB) was calculated as 20*log10(SBR). For display, images were normalized by dividing by the average background signal of all images being compared and setting the lower and upper limits of the colormaps to be the same, where the lower limit was equal to a constant A times the average background and the upper limit was equal to a constant B times the maximum pixel intensity out of all images being compared; images were then converted to dB. For xAM and differential xAM images of bacterial patches, A was set to 1 and B was set to 0.5."

Cultures or cell suspensions to be analyzed were diluted in ice-cold PBS to 2x the final desired cell concentration (calculated from the measured OD600), incubated at 42\u00b0 C. for one minute, and mixed 1:1 with 1% (w/v) agarose in PBS at 42\u00b0 C. for a final concentration of 1x. This mixture was then loaded into the wells in duplicate and allowed to solidify. Care was taken not to introduce bubbles during this process. The phantoms were submerged in PBS, and ultrasound images were acquired using a Verasonics Vantage programmable ultrasound scanning system and an L22-14v 128-element linear array transducer with a center frequency of 18.5 MHz with 67%-6-dB bandwidth, an element pitch of 100 \u00b5m, an elevation focus of 8 mm, and an elevation aperture of 1.5 mm. The transducer was attached to a custom-made manual translation stage to move between samples. B-mode and xAM images were acquired using the same parameters as described previously: the frequency and transmit focus were set to 15.625 MHz and 5 mm, respectively, and each image was an average of 50 accumulations. B-mode imaging was performed with a conventional 128-ray-lines protocol, where each ray line was a single pulse transmitted with an aperture of 40 elements. xAM imaging was performed using a custom sequence detailed previously with an angle of 19.5\u00b0 and an aperture of 65 elements. The transmitted pressure at the focus was calibrated using a Fibre-Optic Hydrophone (Precision Acoustics), and the peak positive pressure was used as the \u201cacoustic pressure\u201d in FIGS. 3A-3I. BURST images were acquired as a series of pAM images as described previously, except the focus was set to 6 mm, and the acoustic pressure was set to 0.15 MPa (1.6 V) for the first 10 frames and 3.0 MPa (25 V) for the last 46 frames.",

To measure the xAM and B-mode signals over time at various acoustic pressures, another script was used to automatically save an xAM or B-mode image every second while the voltage was automatically increased by 2 V approximately every 70 seconds. Each frame consisted of 64 ray lines, which took 180 \u00b5s each to acquire, giving a pulse repetition rate of 86.8 Hz. Based on these results, all subsequent in vitro xAM images of bARGser-expressing EcN were acquired at 18 V (1.29 MPa).",

Typhimurium, xAM imaging was performed at 1.72 MPa (14 V), unless otherwise noted, and BURST was performed using 0.16 MPa (1.6 V) for the first 10 frames and 3.7 MPa (25 V) for the final 46 frames.",

For experiments involving tumor colonization with EcN, MC26 cells were grown in DMEM media in T225 flasks. After trypsinization and resuspension in PBS + 0.1 mg/mL DNAseI, 5 \u00d7 106 MC26 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 6-8-week-old female Balb/cJ mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 14 days (reaching sizes of 200-300 mm3) before injecting 108 EcN cells suspended in PBS via the lateral tail vein. The day before injection of EcN, Ibuprofen was added to the drinking water at 0.2 mg/mL to ameliorate side effects of EcN injections. To prepare the EcN for injection, the appropriate glycerol stocks were used to inoculate 2 mL LB + 1% (w/v) glucose + 25 ug/mL chloramphenicol which was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm overnight. The overnight culture (500 \u00b5L) was used to inoculate 50 mL LB + 0.4% (w/v) glucose + 25 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol in 250 mL baffled flasks, which was grown at 37\u00b0 C. and 250 rpm until reaching an OD600 of 0.3 - 0.6. This culture was pelleted, washed 4 times with PBS, resuspended in PBS at an OD600 of 0.625, and used for injection. Three days after injection of EcN, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 120 mg L-arabinose to induce the EcN. Starting 24 hours after induction, ultrasound images of tumors were acquired as described below. After imaging, 3.0 MPa acoustic pressure was applied throughout the tumor to collapse GVs, and mice were injected again intraperitoneally with 120 mg L-arabinose. The next day, mice were imaged again with ultrasound for re-expression of GVs. The following day, all mice were euthanized and tumors were excised, homogenized, serially diluted, and plated on selective media (LB-agar + 25 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol) as well as on induction plates (LB-agar + 25 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol + 0.4% (w/v) glucose + 0.1% (w/v) L-arabinose).

Any hair on or around the tumors was removed with Nair, and Aquasonic 100 ultrasound transmission gel was used to couple the transducer to the skin. Parabolic B-mode and parabolic AM (pAM) images were first acquired using a custom 128 ray line script. Each image was formed from 96 focused beam ray lines, each with a 32-element aperture and 6 mm focus. The transmit waveform was set to a voltage of 1.6 V in B-mode or 8 V in pAM and a frequency of 15.625 MHz, with 1 waveform cycle and 67% intra-pulse duty. In B-mode, each ray line was a single transmit with all 32 elements, and in pAM each ray line consisted of one transmit with all 32 elements followed by 2 transmits in which first the odd and then the even-numbered elements are silenced. Subsequently, xAM images, additional B-mode images, and finally BURST images were acquired at the same location without moving the transducer using the same parameters as described above for the in vitro experiments (e.g. 18V for xAM, 1.6 V for B-mode, and 1.6 V to 25 V for BURST). At least two separate locations spaced at least 2 mm apart in each tumor were imaged with B-mode, pAM, and xAM. Ultrasound images of tumors were quantified as described above where the sample ROIs were drawn around the necrotic cores in the tumors and the background ROIs were drawn around regions in the gel above the mouse. Images were normalized and plotted on a dB scale as described above except the scaling factors were A=2.5 and B=1 for xAM and pAM and the corresponding B-mode tumor images, and A=10 and B=0.5 for BURST images."

Tumors were then cut in half along the approximate plane of imaging, placed in tissue cassettes, and sent to the Translational Pathology Core Laboratory at UCLA, which embedded samples in paraffin and performed H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and microscopy imaging. Immunohistochemistry was performed using Opal IHC kits (Akoya Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Tissue sections were incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-E. coli antibody (Virostat; catalogue number 1001) or non-reactive rabbit IgG isotype control antibody as a negative control. All sections were then incubated with an Opal 520 polymer anti-rabbit HRP antibody (Akoya Biosciences) and counterstained with DAPI. Sections were imaged in the appropriate fluorescence or brightfield channels using a high throughput scanning system (Leica Aperio VERSA) with 40 \u00b5m resolution."
