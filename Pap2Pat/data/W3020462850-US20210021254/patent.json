    "abstract": "A device employing the generation and enhancement of surface acoustic waves on a highly doped p-type III-V semiconductor substrate (e.g., GaAs, GaSb, InAs, or InGaAs). The device includes two SiO2/ZnO islands, each including a SiO2 buffer layer deposited on the doped p-type III-V semiconductor substrate and a ZnO layer deposited on the SiO2 buffer layer. An input interdigital transducers (IDT) and an output IDT are each patterned on one of the SiO2/ZnO islands. The IDTs generates surface acoustic waves along an exposed surface of the highly doped p-type III-V semiconductor substrate. The surface acoustic waves improve the photoelectric and photovoltaic properties of the device. The device is manufactured using a disclosed technique for propagating strong surface acoustic waves on weak piezoelectric materials. Also disclosed is a photodetector developed using that technique.",

                        "III-V semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs) have been widely used in the optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors, solar cells and photocathodes due to their outstanding photoelectric and photovoltaic properties. Recent research has shown that the optoelectronic performance of GaAs will be significantly improved by using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated and propagated on the GaAs surface with the help of interdigital transducers (IDTs) and the applied radio frequency (RF) alternating current (AC) voltage. This applied periodical potential will deform the crystal lattice of GaAs and bend the energy levels up and down, forcefully suppressing the recombination probability of electrons and holes by spatially separating them. As a result, SAWs helps improve the conversion efficiency of photon energy and the quantum efficiency (QE) in many GaAs applications. Applying SAWs can help realize the high-frequency (GHz) operation of the carriers in nanowires of optoelectronic devices. With the help of SAWs, the transportation of a single electron can be faster and more reliable between two distant quantum dots. Although researchers have successfully utilized SAWs in intrinsic GaAs devices to build hybrid structures, prior art methods have yet to generate SAWs on doped GaAs applications.",
                        "Doping of GaAs is commonly used in the applications in the optoelectronic field and is an essential method in achieving better photoelectric performance. Therefore, improving the compatibility between doped GaAs and SAWs has been an important research topic in order to widely extend the application range of SAWs in optical and electronic devices. To achieve the generation and propagation of SAWs on a doped GaAs surface, two key factors need to be considered and resolved. First, the piezoelectric coupling coefficient of GaAs is much smaller than those of commonly used piezoelectric materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO), lithium niobite (LiNbO3) and aluminum nitrate (A1N). Therefore, only weak SAW can be generated. Second, when the piezoelectric substrate (in this case, GaAs) has been doped, the concentration of free carriers increases, leading to an electrical screening of the radio frequency field applied on the IDTs, and results in a restraint of the generation of the SAWs. To resolve this electrical screening issue, the doped layer may be placed away from the surface layers where the SAWs are generated and propagated. A metal layer may be added on top of undoped GaAs/AlGaAs (aluminum gallium arsenide) heterostructures on n-type doped GaAs substrate. (The undoped GaAs/AlGaAs layers cover the whole n-doped GaAs, but the metal layer do not.) The metal layer electrically screens the piezoelectric field of SAWs so that the SAWs can travel and reach the GaAs in a mechanical way.",
                        "However, to date, prior art methods have yet to be developed to propagate the SAW along the uncovered surface of highly doped p-type GaAs substrate."

Also disclosed is the device made by generating the SAWs on the highly doped p-type GaAs substrate.",
                        "Zinc oxide and silicon dioxide (ZnO/SiO2) islands are built between metal interdigital transducers (IDTs) and p-type doped GaAs substrate. The thin layer of ZnO may be deposited via using an RF magnetron sputtering system. The recipe of radio frequency (RF) sputtering may be optimized to make sure the deposited ZnO layer has high-quality c-axis oriented crystalline structure, which is crucial to successfully generating the SAW. With the existence of ZnO, the strong piezoelectric coupling effect of ZnO is used to more efficiently convert the electrical energy into mechanical energy and pass to GaAs, thereby increasing the intensity of the SAWs on the GaAs. The SiO2 buffer layer may be over 800 nm thick, which we found to improve the performance of SAWs on p-type GaAs. The 800 nm thick buffer SiO2 layer improves performance of SAWs on the p-type GaAs because the SiO2 buffer layer works as a buffer layer that helps mask the crystalline surface of GaAs and improve the adherence, thus forming a better crystal orientation of ZnO layer. In addition to the enhancement of piezoelectricity, the ZnO/SiO2 islands between metal IDTs and p-type GaAs substrate also help separate the applied radio frequency field from the free carriers doped in GaAs substrate. After applying radio frequency alternating current (AC) voltage, the ZnO layer utilizes its strong piezoelectricity to convert the applied electrical energy to mechanical energy in the form of periodical lattice vibration, generating SAWs. The SAWs then penetrate the ZnO/SiO2 island and reach the surface of GaAs substrate, mechanically passing the energy and the periodical vibration to the crystal lattice of GaAs. As a result, the screening of the applied radio frequency electrical field caused by the free carriers in doped GaAs can be effectively reduced because of the separation. Finally, the thickness of the ZnO layer and the width of IDT fingers may be selected to optimize the performance of SAWs propagating along the p-type GaAs surface."

                        "As shown in FIG. 1, the device 100 includes metal interdigital transducers (IDTs) 120, including an input IDT 110 and an output IDT 130. The input IDT 110 is driven by an alternating current source 170. Each of the IDTs 120 are deposited on a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer 140 and a silicon oxide (SiO2) buffer layer 160. Together, the ZnO layer 140 and the SiO2 buffer layer 160 form ZnO/SiO2 islands 150. The IDTs 120 and the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150 are deposited on a highly doped p-type GaAs substrate 190, which includes an exposed surface 192 between the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150.",
                        "According to the literature, SAWs propagating along the [011] direction on (100) GaAs are piezoelectric, while along directions like [001] or [010] are not piezoelectric. Therefore, if the p-type GaAs substrate 190 is a p-type (100) GaAs substrate 190, the metal IDTs 120 in the SAW delay line may be oriented along the [011] direction on the p-type (100) GaAs substrate 190. Alternatively, if the GaAs substrate 190 is a (001) GaAs substrate 190, the metal IDTs 120 in the SAW delay line may be oriented along the [110] direction on the (001) GaAs substrate 190. The SAW is generated through the input IDT 110, which are carried on the ZnO/SiO2 island 150 with the RF signals applied by the source 170. The SAW then propagates along the delay line (varied from 500 \u03bcm to 2 mm) on the exposed surface 192 of the p-type GaAs substrate 190. The output IDT 130 is used to receive the incoming SAW and to calculate the power transmission ratio.",
                        "The metal IDTs 120 may be conventional, single-finger IDTs. The spacing between each IDT finger may be the same as the finger width. In this case, according to the concept and theory of SAW, the wavelength of SAW is equal to four times of the width of an IDT finger when the SAW is launched with the fundamental frequency of the IDT. As the propagating speed of the SAW in each specific material is known, the center frequency of the SAW can be determined. According to literature, the SAW velocity in ZnO varies from 2600 m/s to 5000 m/s depending on the thickness and structure, and the SAW velocity in GaAs is approximately 2700 m/s to 2900 m/s. Because the SAW completely propagates on the exposed surface 192 of the p-type GaAs substrate 190 along the delay line, the center frequency may be determined by the finger widths of the IDTs 130 and the SAW velocity in the GaAs substrate 190.",

The wafer 190 has a wafer top surface and a wafer bottom surface.",

For example, a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method may be used, with an optimized recipe to deposit on top of GaAs substrate at a rate of 120 nanometers/minute. The buffer layer 160 has a buffer top surface and a buffer bottom surface, and in the embodiment shown the buffer bottom surface contacts the wafer top surface.",

The ZnO layer 140 has a ZnO top surface and a ZnO bottom surface, and in the embodiment shown the ZnO bottom surface contacts the buffer top surface. Accordingly, the buffer layer 140 is sandwiched between the wafer 190 and the ZnO layer 140.",
                        "Metal IDTs 120 are patterned on the ZnO top surface of the ZnO layer 140 in step 208. As described above, the input IDT 110 may be patterned to generate SAWs propagating along the [011] direction of the GaAs wafer 190. To transfer the pattern, a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) A4 photoresist may be spin coated on top of the ZnO layer 140 (for example, with a speed of 3000 rpm for two minutes). The device 100 may be baked, for example on hotplate with temperature of 180\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes. The spin-coating and heating process may be repeated (e.g., once more). A process of e-beam exposure (for example, with a Raith Voyager Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) system) may be used to transfer the pattern onto the surface. The patterned photoresist may be developed, for example in a methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) solution for 90 seconds. Aluminum IDT 120 electrode fingers are formed, for example using metallization with an e-beam evaporator. The unwanted photoresist structure may then be lifted off, for example with acetone for 20 minutes, to get the IDT 120 electrode fingers on the ZnO top surface of the ZnO layer 140.",

For example, another layer of photoresist may be spin coated on top of the ZnO layer 140 using the same method described above. The e-beam exposure process may then be conducted again, for example with the Raith Voyager EBL system, to transfer the second pattern on top center of the device 100. The second pattern may be used to etch the SiO2buffer layer 160 and the ZnO layer 140 and expose the exposed surface 192 of the p-type GaAs substrate 190 as shown in FIG. 2. The photoresist may be developed in MIBK solution for 90 seconds. A wet etching method and a reactive ion etcher (RIE) method may be used to eliminate the patterned area of the ZnO layer 140 and SiO2 buffer layer 160, respectively, to expose a portion 192 of the p-type GaAs substrate 190 on surface of the device 100. The unwanted photoresist may be lifted off, for example with acetone for 15 minutes, to obtain the final structure of the device 100.",
                        "As mentioned above, the ZnO layer 140 has a strong piezoelectric coupling effect that efficiently converts the electrical energy into mechanical energy and increases the intensity of the SAWs on the GaAs substrate 190. For a stronger piezoelectric effect, the ZnO layer 140 should preferably be deposited with a high quality c-plane facing up, as SAW cannot be generated and transmitted strongly on a low quality ZnO surface. The recipe of RF magnetron sputtering system includes many parameters\u2014such as plate temperature, gas flow ratio, VAT pressure, time length, pre-sputter and sputter power\u2014that each have its impact on the deposition results. Through experiments, it has been determined that a high quality ZnO layer 140 may be deposited using a RF magnetron sputtering method with a sputtering condition that includes power (P) of 400 Watts (W), a temperature (T) of 250\u00b0 C., argon and oxygen (Ar/O2) of 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) and 11 sccm, pressure of 8 millitorr (mtorr), and a time of 2 hours. That optimized sputtering condition may be used to grow a high-quality c-axis oriented ZnO film 140 (with a thickness of 1100 nanometers) on the p-type GaAs substrate 190.",
                        "By contrast, a ZnO film (with a thickness of 1400 nm) grown using a nonoptimized condition (P=350 W, T=130\u00b0 C., Ar/O2=69 sccm/0 sccm, pressure=17 mtorr, t=2 hour) is a lower quality ZnO deposition with very rough and cracked surface that cannot be used to generate SAWs because of the difficulty to pattern and deposit metal IDTs 120. The optimized recipe, however, produces a high quality deposited ZnO layer 140 with a smooth and clean surface and small ZnO grain size. The high quality ZnO film 140 grown using the optimized recipe has much higher intensity of (002) peak, less amount of off-oriented crystals, a reduced built-in lattice strain, and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the (002) x-ray diffraction (XRD) reflection line. Therefore, with the optimized recipe, a highly textured and highly c-axis oriented ZnO layer 140 may be grown on the p-type GaAs substrate 190.",
                        "Growing the high-quality ZnO layer 140 described above on the SiO2 buffer layer 160 described above also improves the crystal orientation of the high-quality ZnO layer 140 along the c-axis direction. Deposited ZnO film 140 on a sample with the added SiO2 buffer layer 160 using the same optimized RF sputtering recipe produces a more visible hexagonal crystal structure with increased grain size, a higher intensity of (002) peak, a reduced built-in lattice strain, and a reduced FWHM value of the (002) XRD reflection line. Therefore, a high-quality ZnO layer 140 can be formed with a SiO2 buffer layer 160 added between the ZnO film 140 and the p-type GaAs substrate 190.",
                        "The layers 140, 160, and 190 of the device 100 may have any shape, though in the embodiment shown in step 210 the top and bottom surfaces of each of the layers 140, 160, 190 can be substantially flat (i.e., thin and planar) and formed as a square or rectangle. As further illustrated at step 206, the ZnO layer 140 may have the same area as the SiO2 buffer layer 160 so that the ZnO layer 140 fully covers the SiO2 buffer layer 160. However, in other embodiments, the ZnO layer 140 can have larger or smaller area than the SiO2 buffer layer 160. Because the GaAs substrate 190 is larger than the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150, the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150 only partially cover the GaAs substrate 190 and leave an exposed surface 192 of the GaAs substrate 190 between the ZnO/SiO2, islands 150. The width of the exposed surface 192 between the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150 may vary depending on the desired characteristics of the SAWs generated by the IDTs 120.",

The process 200 provides the foundation for using SAWs to improve a variety of III-V semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices 100, such as photocathodes, photomultipliers, photodetectors, etc.",

As shown in FIG. 3B, compared to the sample without a SiO2 buffer layer 160 (black line), a thin (150 nm, red line) SiO2 buffer layer 160 results in higher insertion loss, which is a sign of reduced performance of SAWs. The peak value of the transmission coefficient S21 at center frequency of SAW decreases from \u221254 dB to \u221257 dB, as well as the values in the rest frequency range. Increasing the thickness of the SiO2 buffer layer 160 to 800 nm increases the peak value at center frequency of SAW to \u221252 dB, which is a little bit higher than the one without the SiO2 buffer layer 160 (black line). After continuing increasing the thickness of the SiO2 buffer layer 160 to 1400 nm (green line), the values of transmission coefficient S21 in whole frequency range appear clearly higher than the one without the SiO2 buffer layer 160. Both the peak transmission coefficient S21 value at center frequency (\u221247 dB) and the bandwidth are improved with a SiO2 buffer layer 160 of 1400 nm, which proves the enhancement of SAW transmission performance.",

As shown in FIGS. 4C and 4D, for the device 100 with IDTs 120 having a finger width of 2.3 \u03bcm, the center frequency of SAW changed to 326 MHz, the peak transmission value of S21 decreased to \u221257.1 dB, and the reflection coefficient S11 changed to \u22120.95 dB.",
                        "This center frequency shift with the change of finger widths of the IDTs 120 (from 0.9 \u03bcm to 2.3 \u03bcm) is consistent with the theory that smaller finger widths of IDTs 120 leads to a proportionally higher center frequency of SAW resonance in a specific piezoelectric material (the GaAs substrate 190). The results show the capability of the device 100 in propagating SAWs with different frequencies on the highly doped p-type GaAs substrate 190. In addition, by comparing the two cases, we can see that a SAW with a higher frequency has a better transmission performance on the p-type GaAs surface 190 with the help of the ZnO/SiO2 islands 150.",
                        "As mentioned above, the application of dynamic strain and electric fields of surface acoustic waves has been used as a successful tool for industrial applications such as filters, resonators and sensors. As a result, many electronic systems currently available incorporate SAW-based signal processing devices. SAWs also have many advantages in other research fields, such as being able to manipulate optically generated electronic excitations in semiconductors and to improve the quantum efficiency (QE) of optoelectronic devices. However, in most cases, SAWs can only be generated and propagated along piezoelectric materials. This greatly limits the utilization of SAWs for optoelectronic and acoustoelectric hybrid applications because most commonly used piezoelectric materials\u2014including ZnO (3.1 eV-3.4 eV), AlN (6.0 eV-6.2 eV) and LiNbO3 (3.5 eV-4.7 eV)\u2014have wide band-gap that limits their applications in photoelectric devices.",
                        "Two-dimensional (2D) materials, sometimes referred to as single-layer materials, are crystalline materials consisting of a single layer of atoms. The nanostructures of 2D materials have been studied and used for the transistor-based photodetection, due to their unique optoelectronic properties.",
                        "FIG. 5 is a diagram of a SAW-enhanced two-dimensional material photodetector 500 according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown in FIG. 5, the photodetector 500 includes a 2D material 520, a SiO2 buffer layer 160, and a gallium antimonide (GaSb) layer 560. An input IDT 110 and an output IDT 130 are each patterned on ZnO islands 140. The input IDT 110 is driven by an alternating current source 170. The photodetector 500 includes a metal source electrode 540 and a metal drain electrode 544 on top of the SiO2 buffer layer 160 between the ZnO islands 140 and a metal gate electrode 546 on the bottom of the GaSb layer 560.",
                        "A bias voltage is applied between the source electrode 542, the drain electrode 544, and the gate electrode 546. The photodetector 500 is then able to detect light applied onto the 2D material film 520, whether the light is visible or IR. The current ISD flowing between the source electrode 542 and the drain electrode 544 increases when the photodetector 500 detects visible light and decreases when the photodetector 500 detects IR light as shown in the current v. time graph of FIG. 5.",
                        "The key factor to extend the photodetection spectrum of the photodetector 500 to IR range is the substrate material that has a small band gap to absorb photons in IR range, and then to modulate the band diagram of 2D material. Therefore, in addition the GaSb substrate 560 shown in FIG. 5, other III-V semiconductor materials may be used, such as indium arsenide (InAs) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).",
                        "In addition to the transistor-based photodetection (measuring source-drain current) described above, the transmission characteristics (S21, S11) of the SAW may also independent provide good sensing information. SAW sensors have been widely used for photodetection because of their advantages such as small size, low cost, fast response, and high sensitivity. When the 2D material film 520 and the surface of the GaSb (or InAs or InGaAs) substrate 560 is illuminated by the incident light, the photo-excited carriers inside the surface materials will interact with the piezoelectric field induced by the propagating SAW, which will result in change of the SAW amplitude, phase and velocity. Therefore, by using the output IDT 130 to receive and measure the SAW signal on the other side of the photodetector 500, the SAW-based photodetection (measuring SAW transmission characteristics) may be simultaneously achieved and utilized to provide additional sensing information. As shown in the amplitude v. frequency graph in FIG. 5, after the incident light is absorbed on the photodetector 500, the frequency and amplitude of the transmission coefficient S21 of the propagating SAW will shift and change. Accordingly, the incident light may be detected by detecting the shifts and changes to the transmission coefficient S21.",
                        "The photodetector 500, which developed using the technique of propagating strong SAWs on weak piezoelectric materials (such as the highly doped p-type GaAs substrate 190 described above) has a number of advantages. Unlike conventional single layer two-dimensional material photodetectors, the detection range of the two-dimensional material photodetector 500 is extended to IR spectrum. Also, the IR photodetection performance, such as the light-to-dark current ratio and the minimum detection limit of the IR intensity, is improved by the SAW for over an order of magnitude. In addition to the transistor-based photodetection (measuring source-drain current), the SAW-based photodetection by the output IDT 130 (measuring SAW transmission characteristics) may be utilized simultaneously to provide additional detection information to further increase the sensitivity and selectivity of the photodetection device 500. This unique advantage makes it possible to build a multi-sensory IR photodetector 500 on one single surface.",
