    "abstract": "The present invention describes a two-step computational procedure that both identifies the optimum overall stoichiometry of conversion, along with alternate co-reactant (or co-product) combinations, of a feedstock substrate to a biochemical product, and selects for (non-)native reactions accessed from a universal database to identify at least one stoichiometry-balanced minimal metabolic network, in terms of number of reactions or sum of the flux in the network, that maximize carbon or energy efficiency while satisfying thermodynamic feasibility requirements.

                        "The present invention relates to a computational framework that identifies the optimum overall stoichiometry and selects for (non-)native metabolic reactions for optimizing the converting source metabolite(s) and target product(s).",
                        "Microbial metabolism describes the full range of enzymatic conversions of carbon substrates to cellular biomass precursors, energy equivalents and biochemical molecules. Metabolic engineering harnesses this metabolic machinery for converting feedstock substrates to a growing range of products [1-3]. Recent advances in multiplex engineering (e.g., MAGE [4]), efficient genome-editing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas [5,6]) and genome-wide regulation of gene expression through small RNAs [7] have brought closer the dream of \u201cdesigner cells\u201d that can catalyze any tailor-made stoichiometry-balanced metabolic conversion with high specificity and control [8].",
                        "Existing computational procedures for the de novo pathway design rely on either optimization techniques or graph-search approaches. Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approaches for pathway design, in general, extract a minimal, stoichiometry-balanced sub-network that converts a source metabolite to a target chemical with high yield [9]. While early work was restricted to design pathways for small-to-medium size networks [10-12], recent procedures have reached up to genome-scale size [13-15] often using the concept of elementary modes [16] and comprehensive databases of reactions [17-20]. Generally, pathways are identified that maximize product yield given a single carbon substrate [21] without considering co-substrates, co-products, or complex overall stoichiometries.",
                        "Graph-based pathway design approaches [22] begin from the target chemical and iteratively retrace back a path to the source metabolite using a retrosynthetic algorithm. Using a depth-first search, variations of the k-shortest path approach have been used to design and classify pathways based on their length [23], negativity of free energy of change for each reaction step [24], or use of intermediate metabolites with the fewest connections [25]. Graph-search approaches can be supplemented with \u201creaction-rules\u201d that can suggest de novo reaction steps between any two metabolites often absent in existing databases (e.g., BNICE [26], XTMS [27], GEM-Path [28]). In most cases, the consumption (or production) of cofactors and possibly co-reactants or co-products required for these pathways to operate is not directly tracked [29]. As a result, these procedures are often coupled with a post-processing step where a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is performed to select pathways that are stoichiometry-balanced and maximize the production of target chemicals. As with LP or MILP based approaches, generally mostly linear pathway topologies are traced.",
                        "Powerful as these approaches have been, their primary shortcoming lies in the fact that they aim to trace pathways connecting a single substrate (A) to a single product (B). Metabolic conversions do not generally involve linear paths from substrate to product [21]. Most metabolic engineering tasks recruit many more metabolites and reactions than the ones along the main carbon conversion path. Cofactor usage, co-reactant choices as well as stoichiometric ratios are important decision variables during the pathway design stage. It is the overall stoichiometry that globally captures the overall goal rather than just the origin and destination molecules. This overall stoichiometry can interact in complex ways with the rest of the metabolites forming highly non-intuitive networks constrained by thermodynamics.",
                        "The primary object, feature or advantage of the present invention is the development of a stoichiometry and pathway design tool that optimizes the overall stoichiometry (e.g., aA+cC\u2192bB+dD) by exploring exhaustively co-reactant/co-product combinations. The coefficients in the overall stoichiometry (i.e., a, b, c and a) are critical as they ultimately define the carbon and energy efficiency of the conversion while meeting thermodynamic feasibility.",

                        "Yet another object, feature and advantage of the present invention is that requirements on the minimality of size of the network and negativity of the free energy of change of each individual reaction step can also be imposed to help rank-order all identified designs. One or more of these and/or other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and appended claims.

The source and target metabolites, and the combination of co-reactants/co-products are selected from a universal database, and may range from electron acceptor pairs such as iron(III)/iron(II) driving the oxidation of methane to liquid biofuels, to platform biochemicals such as 2,3-butanediol and 3-hydroxypropionate. Likewise, the set of intermediate biotransformations is selected from a curated database with over 6000 reactions. Combinatorial optimization is employed in the first step to identify the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactant and product metabolites in the overall conversion while maintaining thermodynamic feasibility considerations. In general, the optimization objective is to identify an overall conversion that maximally utilizes a limiting carbon resource towards a target product, while alternate fitness functions such as maximizing the difference between the prices of the target products and the cost of the reactants can also be explored. Participating metabolites could be known a priori or sourced from the database of metabolites. The second step searches through the universal database of elementally and charged balanced reactions to extract a (generally minimal) set of reactions that conform to the identified overall conversion stoichiometry identified under the first step. Additional constraints, such as minimality of reactions with positive Gibbs free energy change and minimizing the number of heterologous reactions in the optimal network can be included in the optimal formulation. The present invention was implemented for three separate case studies of increasing complexity. The first one exhaustively identifies networks that convert glucose to acetate while conserving all carbon atoms with no provision for any additional co-reactants or co-products in the spirit of the recent study by Bogorad and co-workers [30]. The second study, explores the combined use of methanol and carbon dioxide for the production of stoichiometry-feasible C2+ products. The third study, aims at designing thermodynamically feasible overall stoichiometries for fixing methane to acetate and other C2+ co-products. The two-stage procedure recapitulates existing pathway designs [31-34] and identifies novel pathway topologies inaccessible to existing algorithms. Overall conversion stoichiometries and pathway designs span a range of complex network topologies and provide valuable insight as to how the overall conversion pathway changes in response to alternate co-reactant and/or co-product scenarios.",

The term \u201ccomputational\u201d as used herein should be construed broadly to include, but not to be limited to, any number of electronic devices suitable for practicing the methodology described herein. It is further to be understood that because the invention relates to computer-assisted modeling that the scope of the invention is broader than the specific embodiments provided herein and that one skilled in the art would understand how to apply the present invention in different environments and contexts to address different problems in part due to the predictability associated with computer implementations.

Similarly, data may be stored in whole or in part on a computer readable non-transitory medium.",
                        "Despite enormous progress over the past few years, available pathway-design procedures generally are restricted to only (near) linear routes from the source (or metabolite in the host metabolome) to the target metabolite. Linear pathway designs miss cyclic networks with potential for higher efficiency (both carbon and energy) of production (e.g., 100% carbon efficiency in conversion of glucose to acetyl-CoA [30]). In addition, by restricting the degrees of freedom to just the source and target metabolite, the identification of alternative co-reactants/co-products combinations are ignored. While post-processing efforts restore stoichiometry-balance of pathways [28], this may lead to designs with suboptimal carbon and energy efficiencies.",

Performance criteria on the designed pathways (e.g., carbon yield/energy efficiency, pathway \u0394G etc.) can systematically be imposed and rank-order synthetic pathways according to the design objective. Implementation for of this invention in three pathway design studies identified non-intuitive designs with improved efficiencies. Specifically, multiple alternatives for non-oxidative glycolysis are generated and non-intuitive ways of co-utilizing carbon dioxide with methanol are revealed for the production of C2+ metabolites with higher carbon efficiency. Likewise, several non-intuitive solutions were identified for driving forward the thermodynamically unfavorable conversion of methane to acetate and other C2+ metabolites."

Obviously, the list of reactants and products does not have to be restricted to two. More complex overall stoichiometries can be put forth with positive coefficients denoting products and negative reactants. Only one of the stoichiometric coefficients needs to be fixed to a finite value to provide a scaling for the remaining ones. Generally, we fix either the coefficient of the limiting carbon substrate or the primary product. By fixing this coefficient the presence of the corresponding reactant or product in the overall conversion is guaranteed. Note that setting the stoichiometric coefficient of a one-carbon molecule to one may not ensure that all other coefficients can assume integer values due to the balances on all other elements. However, all determined coefficients could be suitably scaled up to obtain an integer-only stoichiometry for all metabolites. The performance criteria of the overall conversion may involve (i) maximum yield for primary product B (i.e. max b while a=fixed), (ii) maximum co-utilization of free reactant C (max c, b=fixed) for a given product yield, (iii) minimum formation of by-product D (min d while b=fixed) or combinations thereof.

Alternatively this margin could become the objective function that is maximized if an economic criterion is used to select reactant/product pairs. Trade-offs between the overall conversion stoichiometry and the negativity of the overall free energy of change can be drawn by varying the value of \u0394Gmin. For large values of \u0394Gmin overall conversions are obtained with a high thermodynamic driving force. As \u0394Goverall is throttled back closer to zero more yield efficient conversions are obtained at the expense of a lower thermodynamic driving force that may limit flux per enzyme loading. Given that biomass formation is an endergonic process (\u0394G>0) it is important to keep \u0394Gmin above the value needed for the desired growth. For example, for the iAF1260 metabolic model we find that the production of all constituents of biomass require a \u0394G of 492.77 kcal g\u22121 biomass. Additional reserves for \u0394G are needed to account for polymerization free energy costs of the biomass precursors not captured in the biomass equation.

In addition, exchange reactions for only the metabolites present in the overall stoichiometry are added to allow for their uptake and export, respectively.

                                "Conversion of glucose through central carbon metabolism to acetyl-CoA (through EMP glycolysis or Entner-Doudoroff pathway) is required by most microorganisms for the production of biomass precursors and cofactors [43]. These pathways are also often recruited for the production of various bioproducts in a variety of production hosts. The generation of ATP and redox equivalent for growth, however, comes at the expense of losing two carbon atoms per glucose molecule as carbon dioxide reducing carbon yield to a maximum of 67%. Alternate modes of glucose metabolism, such as the glycerate pathway [44] lead to the same carbon loss. An exception to this rule is found in some clostridial [45] and lactate-producing bacteria [46] that use a phosphoketolase enzyme to process glucose without any carbon loss as CO2. Recently, a synthetic, non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) was designed and assembled demonstrating the feasibility of this concept [30] for bio-conversions. By expressing in E. coli heterologous phosphoketolase enzymes xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (XPK, E.C.#4.1.2.9) and fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (FPK, E.C.#4.1.2.22) from B. adolescentis Bogorad and co-workers [30] assembled three cyclic networks demonstrating complete conversion of glucose to acetate. In this case study, we benchmark the present invention for the same conversion and explore additional network designs beyond the ones described in Bogorad and co-workers [30].",
                                "The first step, (i.e., OptStoic) here is redundant as the overall stoichiometry in the form of A\u21923B is fixed. Only networks that conserve all carbon flux from glucose to acetate satisfy the imposed overall stoichiometry. Results from both minRxn and minFlux converged to the same designs that achieve the overall conversion albeit with substantial differences in computational time. The smallest network (FIG. 2A) recapitulated the engineered construction of Bogorad and co-workers [30] where glucose undergoes a stepwise conversion to acetyl phosphate (actp) in a cyclic route. First, FPK cleaves fructose-6-phosphate (f6p) to erythrose-4-phosphate (e4p) and acetyl phosphate (actp). Next, e4p follows the reversal of Pentose Phosphate Pathway to produce two molecules of xylulose-5-phosphate (xu5p). Deacetylation of xu5p to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (g3p) by XFP produces two additional molecules of actp. Conversion of g3p to f6p through the reversal of upper glycolysis completes the cycle. Acetate kinase (ACK, E.C.#2.3.1.8) hydrolyses the three actp molecules to terminal acetate. A number alternate routes using FPK or XPK as the sole deacetylating reaction were identified similar to those constructed in Bogorad and co-workers [30] (see FIG. 2B for one of the constructions). Note that in this network design the need for cofactors nadh and nad is balanced with a zero net requirement. minRxn/minFlux can also be used to directly limit the number of reactions with a positive standard free energy of change. While both NOG and all designs shown in FIGS. 2A, B, D, E and F require at least two reactions with a positive standard free energy change, the design depicted in FIG. 2C involves a single reaction with positive \u0394G0 whereby the thermodynamically unfavorable conversion of r5p to ru5p is avoided by routing the Pentose Phosphate Flux through C5 metabolism of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (prpp) and ribulose (rub) in E. coli. However, as a tradeoff this cycle consumes one additional ATP compared to other designs. Networks not involving any CO2 production through the phosphoketolase can also be designed (see FIG. 2D) where glucose uses the modified RuMP pathway to produce three molecules of ethylene glycol. Diol dehydratase (DDT, E.C.#4.2.1.28 [47]) removes a water molecule from ethylene glycol to synthesize acetaldehyde (acald), which can be oxidized to acetate in three steps. This route can be potentially advantageous for the co-utilization of five and six carbon substrates [48].",
                                "We next explored whether it is possible to construct the entire pathway in a single organism unlike the engineered NOG pathway that requires at least one heterologous enzyme (i.e., either FPK or XPK). FIG. 2E illustrates one such design with reactions from only clostridial species such as C. ljungdahlii [49] or thermophilic organisms such as Moorella thermoacetica [50]. Here, the EMP pathway is combined with the Wood-Ljungdahl cycle to fix the CO2 lost in the conversion of pyruvate (pyr) to acetyl-CoA. Two pyr molecules (from one glucose molecule) are decarboxylated by the pyr ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme (PFOR, E.C.#1.2.7.1) [51] to acetyl-CoA and CO2. Subsequently, one CO2 molecule enters the western branch of Wood-Ljungdahl cycle where it is reduced and fixed with thf to methf. Next, methf enters the eastern branch of Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to condense with the second CO2 molecule to synthesize the third molecule of acetyl-CoA. Conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate completes the pathway. Note that all network designs introduced here (see FIG. 2) have a net zero ATP balance as specified in the overall stoichiometry. In contrast, the NOG pathway can produce two ATP molecules (per glucose molecule) from actp hydrolysis. By combining glycolysis and Wood-Ljungdahl we can in principle provide five ATP molecules (see FIG. 2E). However, thermodynamic constraints on the overall conversion (i.e., (i.e., \u0394Goverall\u2266\u22125 kcal) do not allow more than three ATP to be generated. While the ATP generation efficiency of this pathway can be controlled by tuning the ATP and non-ATP producing isozymes of ACK, an alternate pathway (see FIG. 2F) with optimum generation of three ATP can be constructed using enzymes in the ED pathway. Here, the serine metabolism is utilized instead of the western branch to generate methf. However, practical hurdles in fixing all the CO2 released in pyruvate decarboxylation (PFOR) and glycine cleavage (GLYCL, E.C.#1.4.4.2) may make these pathways difficult to engineer.",
                                "In this example, we saw how optimization formulations minRxn/minFlux can be used to select reactions that fully convert glucose to acetate while exploring the impact of minimizing reactions with a positive \u0394G0, selection of production host and minimality of reactions in the designed conversion pathway.",

                                "In the second case study, we focus on the design of the overall conversion when not all participating metabolites are known a priori. A recent study proposed and constructed a biological route for the direct condensation of methanol to ethanol [32] with 100% efficiency of carbon conversion. This motivated us to explore novel designs that can simultaneously convert methanol and co-utilize CO2 towards C2+ product metabolites with zero loss of carbon flux (i.e., A+C\u2192B reaction). Here, unlike the previous case study, product metabolite B is unknown and could potentially be any of the 3330 C2+ metabolites in set I. The negative free energy of change for methanol condensation (\u0394G=\u221216.25 kcal mol\u22121) allows for the endergonic uptake of some CO2 to become thermodynamically feasible. As a result, designed pathways have the potential to achieve higher carbon efficiency than existing methanol condensation routes [32] while also exhaustively exploring all possible C2+ product metabolites.",
                                "We chose maximization of the coefficient of CO2 in the overall stoichiometry as the design objective in optStoic while keeping the methanol coefficient at a value of one. This objective function maximizes the carbon yield of the desired product per mole of the limiting reactant (methanol). As many as 148 target metabolites from set I were identified as thermodynamically feasible products for the conversion (see Supplementary File S5 for full list). Table 1 shows ten of the designs in decreasing order of CO2 uptake. CO2 uptake varies in concert with the oxygen to hydrogen ratio (O:H) in the product metabolite. For example, malonate (C3H4O4), which has a O:H ratio of one has the largest stoichiometric coefficient for CO2 (i.e., 1.25), while 2-methyl butanal (O:H=0.1) has the lowest (0.0714). As hydrogen availability in the reactants is fixed (stoichiometry of methanol is fixed to one), a low O:H ratio in the product reduces water production to satisfy elemental hydrogen balance. Because the oxygen atoms in CO2 are routed to water for products with low O:H ratio, reduced water production limits caused by the fixed availability of H, reduces the co-utilization of CO2 and thus overall carbon yield. It is important to note that the O:H ratio is also critical in deciding whether a desired metabolite is a feasible target product. For example, several platform chemicals such as ethylene glycol (O:H=0.33), 1-butanol (O:H=0.125) and 1,3-propanediol (O:H=0.25) are not feasible solutions as mass conservation of hydrogen and oxygen cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the overall stoichiometry. Furthermore, metabolites with a very high O:H ratio, such as oxalate (O:H=2) and glyoxylate (O:H=1.5) are also not feasible due to limitations in oxygen atoms availability from CO2. Therefore, constraints of the overall design stoichiometry determine the feasibility of the target products as well as their maximum yields. It appears that in all designs thermodynamic feasibility is not the limiting constraint, instead elemental balances for H and O limit overall reaction stoichiometries.",
                                "From Table 1, we selected four products (i.e., acetate, 3-hydroxybuyrate, 2-ketoisovalerate and phloroglucinol) for constructing networks satisfying their overall reaction stoichiometry (see FIG. 3). Both 3-hydroxybuyrate and 2-ketoisovalerate are platform chemicals [52] that also serve as precursors to other biochemicals [28,52] while phloroglucinol is a phenolic derivative used as a building block for cosmetics [53] and explosives [54]. Note that for the construction of the networks we scaled up the overall stoichiometry such that all the coefficients are integers. Optimization formulations minRxn/minFlux revealed that the optimal reaction networks for each conversion involved a common core of reactions that initially convert the C1 substrates to an intermediate product (i.e., acetyl-CoA), which was subsequently routed towards the final product. As a result, the first example (acetate production) spans alternate routes of fixing CO2 with methanol to acetyl-CoA (and acetate). Each one of the identified networks is subsequently coupled with additional reactions to synthesize the three other target products (i.e., 3-hydroxybuyrate, 2-ketoisovalerate and phloroglucinol). The optimal network for converting methanol and CO2 to acetate is divided into two modules (see FIG. 3A). The first module condenses four molecules of CO2 and methanol to synthesize four acetyl-CoA molecules using a combination of methylotropic and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway enzymes. The methyl group of methanol is transferred to Corrinoid protein by CoM-Corrinoid methyltransferases (MTA, E.C.#2.1.1.90 and 2.1.1.246) [55,56], which subsequently condenses with CO2 to acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS, E.C.#1.2.7.4 and 2.3.1.169) enzyme from the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway [57]. The reducing equivalents (ferredoxin) required for powering this conversion is supplied by methanol oxidation in methanol dehydrogenase (MEDH, E.C.#1.1.1.244) in the second module. This module assembles an alternative methanol condensation [32] cycle where four formaldehyde molecules enter a modified ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) Pathway [58] to condense to two actp molecules. Hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS, E.C.#4.1.2.43) and 6-phospho-3-hexulo isomerase (PHI, E.C.#5.3.1.27) found in methylotrophs [58] fix formed into the five-carbon ru5p backbone which is subsequently cleaved in FPK. Pentose Phosphate enzymes convert the intermediate substrates back to ru5p to complete the cycle using reactions also present in the NOG cycle.",
                                "The design shown in FIG. 3A requires the fewest number of reactions, however, the oxygen-sensitive nature of the Wood-Ljungdahl enzymes (MTA, ACS) [32] would be a practical concern. The second synthetic design (see FIG. 3B) uses histidine degradation metabolism [59] and formate dehydrogenase (FORMD) from Clostridia [60] to fix CO2 for acetate production. Here, the RuMP cycle is altered to convert formaldehyde to glycerone instead of actp. Formaldehyde transketolase (FTKT, E.C.#2.2.1.3) from methylotropic yeasts such as P. pastoris [61]) is the only additional reaction required to fix an additional formaldehyde molecule with xu5p, and subsequently cleave it to glycerone. Subsequently, glycerone follows lactate metabolism to acetaldehyde (acald) (in Lactate Aldolase (LA, E.C.#4.1.2.36)), and oxidation of acetaldehyde completes the network.",
                                "A third design using predominantly E. coli reactions was also identified. Here, while half of the formaldehyde molecules (from methanol) are fixed in the modified RuMP cycle, the rest is fixed along with CO2 in a functional reversal of the glyoxylate shunt [62]. Here, glyoxylate is converted to glycine uses the folate-driven C1 metabolism in serine pathway to fix the remaining formaldehyde molecules. C1 metabolism in the serine pathway is combined with serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SERAT, E.C.#2.6.1.45) to fix the remaining formaldehyde to glyoxylate and produce hydroxypyruvate (hpyr). Phosphenolpyruvate (pep), from the reduction of hpyr in glycerate metabolism, fixes atmospheric CO2 in the anaplerotic pep carboxylase enzyme (PPC, E.C.#4.1.1.49). This flux is routed through malyl-CoA (in ATP-driven malate thiokinase (MTK, E.C.#6.2.1.9) [62]) to be cleaved to produce acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate by malyl-CoA ligase (MCL, E.C.#4.1.3.24). As all the reactions in this network are either native to E. coli or have been successfully expressed in prior studies (PC, MTK, MCL) [62,63], it has the fewest potential barriers for its implementation.",
                                "Each one of these cyclic routes can be combined with additional paths to route acetyl-CoA flux towards other target chemicals. FIGS. 4A, B and C show routes for converting methanol and CO2 to a C4, a C5 and a C6 product, respectively. Pathways for 3-hydroxybutyrate (3hbut) recapitulate existing engineered routes through acetoacetyl-CoA [64,65] while also proposing additional synthetic designs that use succinate metabolism and reversal of the \u03b2-oxidation pathway (see FIG. 4A). In addition to thiamine-dependent valine synthesis for 2-ketoisovalerate (2kiv) production [66], a novel route path linking \u03b2-oxidation reversal with valine degradation is also identified (see FIG. 4B). Here, n-butanoyl-CoA in the C4 \u03b2-oxidation cycle is isomerized to isobutyryl-CoA (ibutcoa) in iso-butyryl-CoA mutase (ICM, E.C.#5.4.99.13) [67]. Reversal of 2-ketoisovalerate oxidoreductase (KIVR, E.C.#1.2.1.25) in the valine degradation pathway converts 2-mpropcoa to the target product. In the case of phloroglucinol production, however, the traditional pathway using malonyl-CoA metabolism [68] was not identified by minFlux as it violates the energy requirement for the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCOAC, E.C.#6.4.1.2) step. Instead, acetyl-CoA was converted to hydroxyl-butyryl-CoA (hbutcoa) which incorporates an additional acetyl-CoA molecule to form 3-hydroxy-5-oxohexanoyl-CoA (in 3-hydroxy-5-oxohexanoyl-CoA thiolase (HXCOAT, E.C.#2.8.3.8)). Cyclization and reduction of this molecule synthesizes phloroglucinol.",
                                "This example highlights several of the advantages of the present invention over existing pathway prospecting tools. First, we can set well-defined cutoffs for the performance of the pathway that do not require any post-processing steps unlike existing procedures [17,28,69]. Strict constraints of thermodynamics and overall stoichiometry filter out suboptimal routes and unbalanced conversions. The designs are not restricted to be linear paths [23,27,28] from a substrate to the product, but can explore cyclic routes connected not only by carbon transfer, but also through cofactor balances. More importantly, instead of exploring only A\u2192B type of conversion [17,70], the networks can satisfy complex stoichiometries where the participating metabolites and their coefficients can be design variables. In addition, as seen in the first case study, the performance criteria for each of the two steps (i.e., the overall design and pathway construction) can be altered to match the specific requirements of the design.",
                                "**1.2.3 Case Study 3: Designing Thermodynamically Feasible Paths for the Conversion of Methane to Acetate**",
                                "In the previous case study, only co-product (B) was unknown in the overall conversion. In the third case study, both co-reactant (C) and co-product (D) are design variables. With increased production of methane from natural gas deposits through advanced extraction technologies [71], there is a growing interest of engineering metabolic routes of fixing this gaseous feedstock to C2+ liquid biofuel and biochemical targets [72]. However, the overall conversion creating a C\u2014C bond by fixing methane with a C1 co-substrate (e.g., atmospheric CO2, CO from syn gas, etc.) is thermodynamically unfavorable (e.g., \u0394G=11.05 kcal for CH4+CO2\u2192CH3COOH reaction). Recent studies have suggested that such a conversion can be achieved when coupled with a suitable electron acceptor [73,74]. Several anaerobic microorganisms have evolved ways to couple oxidation of methane with reduction of electron acceptors such as nitrite, sulfate 79, iron and manganese 80. In this study, we first identify all electron acceptors that could be used to convert methane to acetate (C2 product) and rank them according to their carbon yield to acetate. Subsequently, we select five solutions from the list of feasible electron acceptors to design pathways that convert methane and a C1 co-substrate (CO2 or CO) to acetate along with a C2+ platform chemical [1,75].",
                                "Using optStoic and keeping the stoichiometry of acetate fixed at one (as basis), we maximized the stoichiometric coefficient of methane while allowing the production of up to two additional metabolites from set I. Non-carbon containing metabolites including metal ions, anions, protons and water were included as candidates in the overall stoichiometry. optStoic identified many distinct designs with alternative electron-acceptor combinations. Ten designs are shown in Table 2 (see Supplementary File S6 for all the designs). Here, the overall reaction stoichiometry has been rescaled for unit molar consumption of the electron acceptor. The only feasible stoichiometry with a single additional co-metabolite was oxygen. We did not analyze further this stoichiometry as designs for aerobic conversion of methane have already been explored extensively [72,76]. Results demonstrate the varying capacity of different electron-accepting pairs in oxidizing methane to acetate due to thermodynamic considerations. The reduction of one mole of tetrathionate (S4O62\u2212) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) accepts the maximum number of electrons (eighteen) thus converting 4.5 moles of methane to 2.25 moles of acetate. In contrast, one mole of iron(III)/iron(II) reduction (Fe3+/Fe2+) oxidizes only 0.25 moles of methane as it accepts only one electron. The electron acceptor pair S4O62\u2212/H2S also supplies the oxygen required for the carbonyl group in acetate and oxidize additional hydrogen in methane to water. Most of the electron accepting pairs such as nitrate/nitrite (NO3\u2212/NO2\u2212) and sulfite/hydrogen sulfide (HSO3\u2212/H2S) perform both tasks. Only pair Fe3+/Fe2+ performs the role of electron acceptor while water supplies the oxygen. Note that the commonly found electron pair sulfate/hydrogen sulfide reduction (SO42\u2212/H2S) utilized by several marine anaerobic consortia for methane oxidation [77,78] was not identified as a feasible solution as \u0394Goverall of the reaction (\u22124.41 kcal mol\u22121 acetate) was below the allowable \u0394Gmin (\u22125 kcal mole\u22121 acetate) set for this case study.",
                                "For the second step of optStoic we selected five pairs of electron acceptors from Table 2 (i.e., NO3\u2212/NO2\u2212, HSO3\u2212/H2S, NO2\u2212/NH4+, Fe3+/Fe2+ and HSO3\u2212/S2O32\u2212) with different efficiencies of methane fixation per mole of oxidizing metabolite. For a unit mole conversion of each pair, we searched for a stoichiometry that further improves methane uptake by allowing for up to two additional metabolites from set I (similar to Step 1). The co-substrates were restricted to CO2 and CO while the co-products were chosen from all C2+ compounds (3330 in set I). Table 3 compares ten of the designs for HSO3\u2212/H2s and NO3\u2212/NO2\u2212 electron acceptors. Both acceptors exhibit the same general trend with products with higher carbon ratio have higher stoichiometry of methane uptake (per unit mole of acetate production). In contrast to Case Study 2, it was the thermodynamic feasibility of the overall reaction and not the O:H ratio of the product that was limiting methane utilization. By allowing both the reactant and co-reactant stoichiometries to vary we have an additional degree to freedom to match the O:H ratio of the target product and maximize methane utilization all the way to the thermodynamic limit (i.e., \u0394Goverall=\u22125 kcal). It is also interesting to note that NO3\u2212/NO2\u2212 allows for much higher efficiency of methane fixation compared to HSO3\u2212/H2S. This is also because the thermodynamic driving force and not the electron-accepting capability of the electron acceptor becomes the limiting factor in this case.",
                                "Each of the five electron acceptors was used to suggest minimal networks for fixing methane to a different target product (see FIGS. 5 and 6). Similar to previous study, results showed that a core set of reactions first converted methane and the co-reactant to intermediate acetyl-CoA. We used the first design (i.e., Fe3+/Fe2+ for acetate production) to",
                                "describe existing and novel routes of fixing methane and CO2 (or CO) to acetate (see FIG. 5). Additional designs concentrate on the paths from acetate to the final products (see FIG. 6). All designs reveal that the terminal acceptors exchanged electrons with a cofactor pair instead of directly catalyzing a reaction in the carbon-transfer network. Different cofactors were identified for the electron acceptors depending on the reduction reactions in the network. For example, Fe3+/Fe2+ and No2\u2212/NH4+ use nadh as the electron donor, catalyzed by NAD:Fe oxidoreductase (E.C.#1.16.1.7, from denitrifying bacteria such as P. denitrificans [79]) and ammonia oxidoreductase (E.C.#1.16.1.15, from E. coli [80]) respectively. In contrast, HsO3\u2212/H2s exchanges electrons with napdh using sulfite reductase (e.g., in E. coli [81], E.C.#1.8.1.2), while reduced ferredoxin does the same for NO3\u2212/NO2\u2212 using a nitrite oxidoreductase (e.g., from N. gracilis [82], E.C.#1.7.7.2). In some cases photosynthetic enzymes found in plant chlorophylls were initially suggested such as ferredoxin-dependent thiosulfate reductase (E.C.#2.8.1.3, from A. thaliana [83]) for HsO3\u2212/S2O32\u2212 (see FIG. 6C). Upon excluding them an alternate mechanism was identified by minFlux where HSO3\u2212 is converted to S2O32\u2212 through the oxidation of mercaptopyrvate (to pyruvate) by sulfurtransferases (E.C.#2.8.1.2) found in E. coli [84] (see FIG. 6C). Note that a few of the designs require electron transfer between NAD(P)H and ferredoxin for regeneration of reduced ferredoxin (fdr) (e.g., see FIGS. 5B and C). While the free energy change under standard conditions suggests that this reaction is favorable only in reverse (i.e., \u0394Gnad/fd=3.83 kcal [85]), there exists multiple experimental evidence alluding to the feasibility of electron transfer from NAD(P)H to ferredoxin [86].",
                                "FIG. 5 shows three alternate routes for the conversion of three molecules of methane and one molecule of CO2 to two acetate molecules with Fe3+/Fe2+ as the terminal electron acceptor. The smallest network (FIG. 5A) describes a functional reversal of the methanogenesis pathway where a molecule of methane and CO2 combine to synthesize acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is subsequently hydrolyzed to acetate. The key enzymes in this pathway are CoM reductase (MCR, E.C.#2.8.4.1), Corrinoid methyltransferase (MTBA, E.C.#2.1.1.246), heterodisulfide reductase (HDR, E.C.#1.8.98.1) and the acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), all found in most methanotropic archaea and some methylotrophs [74]. However, in order to maintain the 1:1 stoichiometric balance of methane and CO2 in ACS reaction, one molecule of methane is oxidized to CO2 in a complex three-step cyclic route involving a functional reversal of the eastern branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. First, thf is converted to 5-methyl thf (mthf) by transferring methyl group from methyl Corrinoid protein homologous to MTBA reaction [87]. This substrate is subsequently oxidized by nad or ferredoxin cofactors (according to stoichiometric demands of each cofactor) and hydrolyzed to formate. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH, E.C. #1.2.1.2) oxidizes formate to CO2. Likewise, alternate routes for oxidizing methane can also be engineered that directly oxidizes methyl-coM to CO2 in the methylamine cycle. Here, the methyl group is transferred to dimethylamine (dma) in trimethylamine methyltransferase (TMMT, E.C. #2.1.1.247) that is homologous to MTBA [88]. Trimethylamine (tma), thus formed, is cleaved by tma oxide aldolase to produce formaldehyde. Oxidation of formaldehyde to CO2 completes the network. The third bypasses the ATPS and MTBA reactions by combining the two previous cyclic networks. Here, CO2 is first reduced to CO which is subsequently fixed to acetyl-CoA through the western branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (FIG. 5C). It must be noted that all the enzymes (except for the terminal electron acceptors) are present in most anaerobic methanogens that makes these networks easier to construct. This case study highlights the fact that the cofactor balances play a significant role in network-design. For example, the net reduction of 5-methyl thf to 5,10-methylene thf is accomplished by two opposite reactions involving nad and ferredoxin cofactors (FIG. 5A) in order to maintain the overall balance of individual cofactors.",
                                "FIG. 6 describes a few of the existing strategies and novel routes of for maximizing the production of four platform chemicals (i.e., 2,3-butanediol, 3-hydroxypropionate, 1-butanol and 1,3-propanediol [52,75]), each utilizing a different electron acceptor. In addition to existing routes of synthesizing the target product, we also identified alternate pathways with equal or higher carbon yields. For example, 2,3-butanediol (23but) could be synthesized from acetyl-CoA by first converting it to pyruvate (using pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) [51]) with subsequent dimerization to acetolactate (see FIG. 6A). Decarboxylation of acetolactate followed by reduction of acetolactate produces 2,3-butanediol. While standard pathways (from pyruvate [89]) lose two carbon atoms for each molecule of 23but, this pathway preserves all the carbon molecules as the lost CO2 is compensated in the PFO step. It is interesting to note that this pathway uses the same enzymes (except the MTBA reaction) of converting CO to 23bdo in a recent study in three separate acetogenic Clostridial species [34] as well as functionally expressed in E. coli [90]. This shows how overall stoichiometry constraints leverage known routes to allow for the uptake of co-reactants (methane in this case) that improves the overall carbon efficiency of conversion. An alternate pathway was also identified where one acetyl-CoA molecule is oxidized to acetaldehyde, which combines with a second acetyl-CoA molecule to form acetoin through the reversal of acetoin dehydrogenase (ACTDH, E.C. #2.3.1.190) found in acetoin consuming bacteria such as E. aerogenes [91].",
                                "Three pathways were identified for 3-hydroxypropionate (3 hp) production all of which have been explored previously (see FIG. 6B). While the first two paths hydrolyze and reduce pyruvate through lactate [92] and \u03b2-alanine [33] as intermediates, the third pathway (and shortest) path utilizes malonyl-CoA reduction [93]. However, unlike the first pathway, the other two are less energy-efficient due to an additional ATP requirement for pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCOAC, E.C.#6.4.1.2) reactions respectively. Similarly, the shortest route for 1-butanol production (FIG. 6C) recapitulates existing strategies involving condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA in accoa acetyltransferase (ACT, E.C.#2.3.1.9) followed by a functional reversal of the \u03b2-oxidation pathway [31,94,95]. A so far unexplored pathway is also suggested that combines the oxidative branch of TCA cycle with succinate-semialdehyde metabolism to reach 1-butanol. Here, pyruvate (from acetyl-CoA) is first carboxylated to oxaloacetate in the ATP-dependent pyruvate carboxylase reaction (PC). The TCA cycle converts oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglurate, which is decarboxylated to succinate-semialdehyde in akg decarboxylase (AKGCL, E.C. #4.1.1.71 found in Synechocystis [96]). Reduction of succinate semialdehyde, similar to \u03b2-oxidation reversal synthesizes 1-butanol. In the case of 1,3-propanediol (see FIG. 6D), the only identified pathway converts acetyl-CoA to pyruvate which is reduced back to g3p through gluconeogenesis. Glycerol, from g3p, is subsequently reduced to 13pdo in three steps by the native (e.g., in some Clostridia [97]) or engineered enzymes found in E. coli and K pneumonie (i.e., the DuPont pathway [98]). The present invention could not identify an alternate pathway in E. coli [99] where homoserine (hser) flux is routed towards 3-hydroxypropanal (2hpa) by engineering the native glutamate dehydrogenase to be promiscuous towards homoserine. The reason is because the intermediate metabolite 4-hydroxy-2-oxobutyrate (4hkbut) in the pathway as well as the reactions associated with the molecule (see FIG. 6D in red) was absent in our database. Upon inclusion of the metabolite and the reactions, minFlux could identify this pathway as an alternate more energy efficient route for 13pdo production.",
                                "In this study we identified and rank-ordered feasible electron acceptor pairs according to their methane oxidation potential. Unlike the previous example, thermodynamic feasibility and not elemental balances becomes the limiting factor in determining the optimum stoichiometric ratios in the overall reaction. minFlux identified relevant cofactor systems that coupled the methane utilization pathway with the terminal electron acceptors.",

Performance criteria on the designed pathways (e.g., carbon yield/energy efficiency, pathway \u0394G etc.) can systematically be imposed and rank-order synthetic pathways according to the design objective. The three examples highlight the potential of this procedure for designing a thermodynamically feasible overall conversion stoichiometry, selecting the optimum combination of co-metabolites and co-products, and constructing non-intuitive synthetic biological routes for the overall conversion.",
                                "For the most part existing databases such as MetRxn [35] or Kegg [100] span a very large population of intermediate metabolites that can be produced from the reacting metabolites. In contrast, the number of terminal pathways towards target products tends to be much more limited. For example, acetyl-CoA is associated with 153 reactions, while 13pdo and phloroglucinol are involved in one and two reactions, respectively. Therefore, most of the novel network designs suggested by minRxn/minFlux stemmed from alternate intermediate metabolites and ways of producing them. A potential way of expanding the diversity of network design would be to consider hypothetical biotransformations generated by successively applying reaction operators on metabolites [29,70]. For example, in a recent work for synthesizing platform chemicals in E. coli, GEM-Path [28] suggested a pathway for 13pdo production from malate that involved two de novo reactions. By combining minRxn/minFlux with compilations of hypothetical reactions and metabolites (e.g., BNICE [70], GEM-Path [28], XTMS[27]) the scope and diversity of designed synthetic networks would increase significantly. In addition, integration of kinetic (e.g., BRENDA [101]) and toxicity information [102] can be incorporated within minRxn/minFlux to further restrict the design space by avoiding kinetic bottlenecks and toxic intermediates."
