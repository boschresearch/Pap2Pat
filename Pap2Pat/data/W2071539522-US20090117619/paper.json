    "title": "Complete Genome Sequence of the Complex Carbohydrate-Degrading Marine Bacterium, Saccharophagus degradans Strain 2-40T",
    "date": "2008-05-30",
    "abstract": "The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40) is emerging as a vanguard of a recently discovered group of marine and estuarine bacteria that recycles complex polysaccharides. We report its complete genome sequence, analysis of which identifies an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade >10 complex polysaccharides. Not only is this an extraordinary range of catabolic capability, many of the enzymes exhibit unusual architecture including novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules. We hypothesize that many of these features are adaptations that facilitate depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment.",

                "Carbon cycle fluxes are critical to understanding global warming equations. Many of the terrestrial prokaryotes that fix CO2 have been studied; and many of the microorganisms that degrade approximately 119 pentagrams of carbon per year (PgC/yr) on land have been characterized. Likewise, prokaryotic CO2 fixation (i.e. photosynthesis) has been studied in the oceans, with cyanobacteria, e.g. Synechococcus and Procholorcococcus, found to be major contributors [1],[2]. What has remained a mystery is whether prokaryotes mineralize plant/algal cell walls and woody material in the oceans and, if so, which organisms are responsible. That is, much less is known about how the approximately 97 PgC in complex polysaccharides that are produced each year in the oceans are recycled to CO2 [http://science.hq.nasa.gov/oceans/system/carbon.html]. These include complex polysaccharides associated with biofilms, planktonic organisms, algal blooms, shells of benthic invertebrates, and especially higher plant material. Recently, several related bacterial genera that carry out these processes have been discovered [3],[4], either by isolation or metagenomics. A recent wide-ranging metagenomic global expedition revealed that genes related to these taxa are among the most abundant in the oceans [5]. These recently recognized organisms are likely to have a key role in the recycling of marine biomass carbon, thereby enhancing the turnover rates of recalcitrant complex polysaccharides and thus contributing to atmospheric CO2 inputs.",
                "Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40T (Sde 2-40; formerly Microbulbifer degradans strain 2-40), is the first free-living marine bacterium demonstrated to be capable of degrading cellulosic algae and higher plant material. 16S rDNA analysis shows that Sde 2-40 is a member of the gamma-subclass of the phylum Proteobacteria, related to Microbulbifer hydrolyticus [3] and to Teredinibacter sp., [4], cellulolytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are symbionts of shipworms. The classification of Sde 2-40 has recently been clarified, with its placement in a new genus, Saccharophagus degradans, [6] that forms a third genus in this newly emerging Microbulbifer/Teredinibacter/Saccharophagus group of marine carbohydrate degraders. Of the 20 isolates in this group, the genome of Sde 2-40 is the first to be sequenced.",
                "Sde 2-40 was isolated from decaying salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed [7]. It is a pleomorphic, Gram-negative, aerobic, motile gamma-Proteobacterium, uniquely degrading at least 10 different complex polysaccharides, including agar, chitin, alginic acid, cellulose, \u03b2-glucan, laminarin, pectin, pullulan, starch and xylan [8]. These enzymatic capabilities initially suggested that Sde 2-40 has a significant role in the marine carbon cycle: functioning as a \u201csuper-degrader\u201d and mediating the breakdown of complex polysaccharides from plants, algae and invertebrates. It represents an important and understudied system.",
                "The Sde 2-40 genome, sequenced to completion and closed (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/micde/micde.home.html, Accession # CP000282), has 4008 genes in a single replicon consisting of 5.06 Mb (Table 1). The genome annotation reveals that Sde 2-40 is unique in its variety of depolymerases and unusual in its number of open reading frames coding for complex polysaccharide depolymerases. These carbohydrases and related proteins, comprising 10% of the genome, contain extraordinary modularity, interesting architecture and a remarkable proportion of membrane targeting domains. Although such an arrangement is limited to few taxa, the bacteria within these taxa appear to be widely distributed in marine and estuarine waters."

                        "The genome of Sde 2-40 is a single circular chromosome of 5,057,531 bp (the general features of the genome are listed in Table 1, and a detailed map is shown in Figure 1). Nucleotide 1 was assigned at the predicted origin of replication. Overall, the Sde 2-40 genome is 45.8% G+C. A total of 4,008 protein-encoding genes were predicted, averaging 1,094 bp in length, with intergenic regions averaging 166 bp. The open reading frames (ORFs) account for 4,385,202 nucleotides of coding sequence (86.7%). An additional 9 ORFs are classified as pseudogenes (Table 1). Of the 4,008 putative proteins, 3,795 matched a sequence in the NR database with an e-value of <1e-5; of these, 2994 were given a functional assignment based on similarity to a COG group, and 704 were classified as conserved hypothetical proteins. For 2575 of the genes with an identifiable ortholog, the closest homolog was found in a gamma proteobacterium with the largest representation (1057) present in a fluorescent pseudomonad or the closely related Hahella chejuensis. Nearly all of these genes appear to function in basic metabolism suggestive of an ancestral relationship; but little synteny was observed with several Pseudomonas genomes or Hahella chejuensis (data not shown).",
                        "In addition to protein-encoding genes, forty one genes for tRNAs and two rRNA gene clusters, located on different strands, were identified (Table 1). Both numbers are atypically low for gamma proteobacteria as E. coli strains carry 90\u2013100 tRNA genes whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have roughly 55\u201364 tRNA genes. The mean number of rRNA clusters in gamma proteobacteria is 5.7. The plus strand rRNA locus of Sde2-40 has an unusual configuration with two divergently directed protein-encoding genes (Sde_1099 and Sde_1100) located between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes and the locus is flanked by apparent noncoding regions with uncharacteristically low G+C."

                        "The Sde 2-40 genome exhibits mosaicism in G+C content (Figure 1) suggestive of recently acquired segments from organisms with divergent genomes. It undergoes frequent cell/cell contact with other cells of the same species and even with eukaryotes. To identify horizontally acquired genes, protein-coding sequences for genes identified in the Sde 2-40 genome were evaluated using the CodonW algorithm for %G+C content, %G+C content of the third position of synonymous codons (GC3s) and for effective number of codons (Nc) as an indicator of codon usage. The %G+C content of protein-encoding genes was 46.3 \u00b13.6 with a disproportionate number of genes having low G+C. As the low %G+C genes tended to be clustered hypothetical genes of unassigned function, the reference gene set was defined as the subset of Sde 2-40 genes whose predicted function is basic metabolism. These also exhibited strong similarity to a homolog present in a pseudomonad (1057 comparable genes). This reference gene set exhibited a mean %G+C of 47.2\u00b13.1, a GC3s of 43.8\u00b15.8 and the Nc was 48.96\u00b15.44. When these values were used to survey the genome, 35% of the genes (1412) were at least one standard deviation from the mean in at least two of the scored characters. Surprisingly only 23 out of 182 genes predicted to encode carbohydrases or CBM proteins exhibited this characteristic, suggesting that if recently acquired, the source organism had a genome similar to that of 2-40.",
                        "Several large clusters of divergent genes were identified in this survey that had characteristic features of integrons. The core integron was located between nt 526536 and 568028 and consisted of 40 genes expressed from the same strand. The integron was flanked by integron/phage integrases on each end. This region had a mean %G+C of 37.9\u00b12.5 and all but three genes have unassigned functions. A 140 bp repeat was identified in each of the intergenic regions separating apparent transcriptional units that were >95% conserved. The same repeat was similarly located at five satellite sites in the genome (nt 2304665-2329512, 2953034-2974232, 3741500-3743893, 3937018-3943585, 4404545-4411107). These satellite regions also were low %G+C regions and most were on a flank, or internally in a transposase gene (exception: 3741500-3743893 region), suggesting that transposition of a repeat could generate a satellite integration site. Nearly all of the genes in these satellite clusters were also expressed from the same strand. There is some duplication of genes within these clusters but little synteny between them. Only Sde_0462 & Sde_0463 were syntenous with Sde_1818 & Sde_1819 suggesting that each of these clusters arose independently. For example, Sde_0426 is highly similar to Sde_0457 and Sde_1825. Sde_0456 and Sde_0458 are apparent duplicates of Sde_0427. Sde_0462 is homologous to Sde_1814, Sde_1818 and Sde_1830. Five other clusters of hypothetic genes were identified that lacked this repeat sequences (134591- 150065; 341150-354005; 418539-430371; 764673-773707; 3837720-3846061; 4133935-4137958) but were associated with an apparent transposase (DUF1568 homolog). In total, five potentially functional integron /phage integrases were identified in the genome that were associated with degenerate prophage (incomplete) or these integrons. Two integrase pseudogenes and three IS elements were also detected (ISSde_A, ISSde_B, ISSde_C)."

Each contains multiple domains and motifs that are reported to bind calcium and mediate protein/protein interactions [9],[10]. They are acidic, pI 3.5\u20134.9 and have a secretion signal. It is possible that proteins with these properties can function in binding prokaryotes to algae with associations between gamma proteobacteria and dinoflagellates reported [11]. These large proteins are unusual and help explain why the Sde 2-40 genome contains 5.06 Mb but codes for only 4008 genes, well below the general rule for prokaryotes of about one Kb/gene. The seven largest of these proteins are encoded by 120879 bases or approximately 2.4% of the genome."

                        "A common feature of each of the Sde 2-40 carbohydrase systems is their induced expression in response to their cognate substrate [8],[12],[13]. Many organisms with complex carbohydrase systems, constitutively express low levels of one or a few \u201csentinel\u201d enzymes. The role of these sentinel enzymes is to release inducer molecules from the polysaccharide substrate which then activate one or more signal transduction systems to induce expression of the entire degradative pathway. This mechanism has been demonstrated experimentally for the cellulolytic fungus, Trichoderma reesei and the bacterium Clostridium thermocellum [14],[15],[16].",
                        "Each of the tested carbohydase systems exhibit classic glucose-dependent catabolite repression. In silico analysis confirms that the Sde 2-40 genome contains a strong homolog of adenylate cyclase (Sde_3600) and catabolite activator protein (Sde_0755) as well as the components of a phosphotransferase system (e.g. Sde_0348, Sde_3180, Sde_3182).",
                        "The genomic signal transduction profile of Sde 2-40 can be viewed in the MIST (Microbial Signal Transduction) database at http://genomics.ornl.gov/mist. Compared to other prokaryotic genomes, Sde 2-40 has approx. 40% more COG's devoted to signal transduction than other bacteria, (including the gamma proteobacteria; Table S1), although it has an average number of one- and two-component signal transduction regulatory systems for its genome size [17]. It also does not contain any unique sensor or regulator, however, some features of signal transduction do set the organism aside. These features are directly linked to its unique abilities to degrade complex polysaccharides. First, the genome is significantly enriched in regulators that control the level of cyclic di-guanylate, a second messenger, which determines the timing and amplitude of complex biological processes predominantly linked to the cell surface, such as exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and degradation and biofilm formation [18]. Cyclic di-GMP cyclases comprise the single largest signal transduction output domain family in the genome (more than 1% of the total genome content), although usually the most abundant output type in bacteria is one of the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domains typical of transcription factors [17].",
                        "Another significant feature is the large proportion of membrane-bound one-component transcription factors. Less than 3% of bacterial one-component transcription factors are membrane-bound [17],[19], whereas in Sde 2-40 they comprise 20%. For example, 16 of the 31 AraC-type transcriptional regulators are membrane-bound in Sde 2-40, whereas all such regulators in a closely related species, Shewanella oneidensis, are soluble cytoplasmic proteins. AraC-type transcription factors frequently function as transcriptional activators of enzymes involved in catabolic pathways, although family members also activate or repress transcription of genes with a wide range of functions. The activity of AraC-like transcription factors is usually regulated allosterically by small molecules, such as the substrate for the first enzyme of a catabolic pathway.",
                        "Since bacterial transcriptional factors often directly regulate adjacent genes [20], we analyzed the genomic context in the vicinity of membrane-bound transcription factors and found several of them in the chromosomal proximity to diverse enzymes involved in cellulose degradation (Table 2). Most of these proteins are the result of the lineage-specific gene expansion; i.e. 13 of the 16 membrane-bound AraC-type transcriptional regulators are paralogs. We hypothesize that the unusual enrichment in membrane-bound transcription factors is an adaptive strategy for detecting extracellular complex polysaccharides and expressing genes necessary for its degradation.",
                        "The Sde 2-40 genome contains sets of genes for flagellar and type IV pili-based motility as well as regulatory systems for their control. There are two dedicated chemotaxis pathways predicted to control flagellar motility (anchored by chemotaxis histidine kinases CheA GI:90020168/Sde_0519 and GI:90021806/Sde_2161) and two chemotaxis-like pathways predicted to control type IV pili-based motility or other cellular functions (anchored by chemotaxis histidine kinases CheA GI:90022749/Sde_3107 and GI:90023269/Sde_3629). This implies that Sde 2-40 is not only capable of navigating to nutrient sources in water, but can also direct its motility across solid surfaces such as solid plant material. The chemotaxis signal transduction network contains 13 transducers for detecting both extracellular and intracellular signals. Interestingly, there are 8 predicted CheY response regulators. We hypothesize that diverse signals detected by chemotaxis transducers are distributed to control not only two types of motility apparatus, but also other cellular activities."

SignalP analysis revealed 1068 gene model products (26.6% of the gene models) that carry an apparent amino terminal signal sequence indicative of Sec-dependent secretion. The components for the Sec-associated SRP system for translocation of membrane proteins were also present. The Sde 2-40 SRP system appears to be unusual in that SRP54 M and G domains are located on separate polypeptides.",

At least 15 gene products were annotated as being Tat secreted; most of these appear to be translocated to the periplasm. Components of both type I and type II secretion systems were also detected. Homologs of HlyB, HlyD and TolC, the essential components of a type I secretion system [21], were encoded by an apparent operon. Since type I secretion systems use a cryptic carboxy terminal secretion signal, proteins secreted by the type I system are not genomically obvious. However, there are several partial homologs of RTX toxins that are good candidates.",

This complexity is required to overcome the chemical and structural complexities presented by complex polysaccharides and complex polysaccharide-containing structures (i.e. the plant cell wall). Among the fungi and bacteria, the vast majority of complex polysaccharide-degrading enzymes belong to different families of Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH). As classified by the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme webserver (www.CAZY.org/index.html), GHs are assigned to 112 sequence-based families. A distinctive feature of the GHs that attack complex insoluble polysaccharides is their modular architecture, in which the catalytic module(s) is linked to one or more non-catalytic modules.",

They potentiate catalysis by reducing the access limitation imposed by the composite structure of the complex polysaccharide. These CBMs, grouped into approximately 50 sequence based families, specifically target the enzyme to its proper substrate amongst the chemical and structural complexities of the plant cell wall. Furthermore, CBMs allow soluble enzymes to remain in contact with their insoluble substrates in an aqueous environment [23].",

For example, most characterized cellulase systems contain multiple endo-acting enzymes and one or more exo-acting cellulases, which usually liberate cellobiose from cellulose chains (cellobiohydrolases). The activity of the endoglucanases provides more free chain ends to be acted on by the cellobiohydrolases. Most systems also incorporate \u201caccessory enzymes\u201d such as cellodextrinases and cellobiases to achieve complete breakdown to usable monomers [24],[25]. Figure 2 illustrates the modular components of a typical GH and presents a generic cellulose degradation pathway. Specific substrates and carbohydrases are shown in Figure 3.",

Most carbohydrase-coding ORF's are dispersed throughout the genome, however, some are clustered, including amylases (Sde_0556-Sde_0601), arabinoxylosidases (Sde_0777-Sde_0789), pectinases (Sde_0937-Sde_0953), and alginases (Sde_3272-Sde_3286).",
                        "The set of glycosidases encoded by Sde 2-40 is particularly adapted to the degradation of a multitude of plant and algal cell wall polysaccharides and is characterized by an extreme modularity in the structure of the enzymes (see Figure 2; Figures S1, S2, and S3). Substrates catabolized include cellulose, substituted xylans, xyloglucans, arabinans and arabinogalactans; pectin and rhamnogalcturonan; \u03b2-1,3(4) glucan, \u03b2-1,3-glucans; starch, glycogen, pullulan; mannans, glucomannans and galactomannans. Interestingly, the xylan, mannan and cellulose degrading apparatus of Sde 2-40 is very similar to the reported cellulases, xylanases and mannanases synthesized by a related terrestrial gram negative bacterium, Cellvibrio japonicus (for review see [26]). The similarity between the GH and CBM (see below) composition of these enzyme systems in Sde 2-40 and C. japonicus indicate a close evolutionary relationship between the plant cell wall degrading apparatus in the two organisms. The etiology of such a relationship remains a compelling area for study.",
                        "In addition to the cellulose, xylan and mannan degrading enzymes described above, the Sde 2-40 genome also encodes eight endo-\u03b2-1,3-glucanases (Table 3), each of which has a type II secretion signal sequence, interesting domain architecture and modules [viz. thrombospondin type 3 (TSP3) and cadherin-like (CADG) calcium-binding motifs]. It is also noteworthy that the Sde 2-40 genome codes for 33 polysaccharide lyases (PLs; Figure S4), far more than any other bacterium including B. thetaiotamicron (15), Erwinia carotovora (13) and Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (8) and any fungus. The only organisms that have (marginally) more PLs than Sde 2-40 are the plants (Arabidopsis has 34 and the poplar has 39) whose higher number is entirely attributable to large multigene families. Twenty three of the 33 Sde 2-40 PLs are modular (a proportion never seen before). Significant domain structures are shown in Figure S4.",

More than one-quarter of the >180 carbohydrate depolymerases have polyserine repeat regions (PSL) separating functional domains [27], rather than the proline/threonine sequences that link the modules of GHs in other prokaryotes. PSL are also evident in the plant cell wall degrading enzymes of C. japonicus [26],[28], again pointing to a close evolutionary relationship between the plant cell wall degrading apparatus of the two bacteria.",
                        "It is possible that the large number of CBM-containing enzymes reflects the chemical complexity of the marine plant cell wall as compared to the corresponding terrestrial structures. However, it seems more likely that the apparent requirement for secreted enzymes to contain CBMs in the marine bacterium, may reflect the aqueous nature of the environment. Thus, in such a dilute ecosystem, if secreted enzymes are not tethered to the plant cell wall via CBMs they will rapidly disperse and their benefit to the host organism will be lost. Indeed, the critical \u201ctethering\u201d role of the CBMs may select for modules with high affinity for the plant cell wall. In GHs that contain multiple CBMs very tight affinity for targeted polysaccharides can be achieved through avidity effects between the modules [29],[30]. Indeed, the evolutionary driver for the multiple CBMs in the extracellular Sde 2-40 enzymes could be the requirement for these GHs to be in continued contact with the plant cells preventing their dissipation into the aqueous marine environment. It is also possible that the presence of multiple CBMs is the result of adaptation to the high-ionic strength environment presented in marine and estuarine environments.",

It has more than Arabidopsis thaliana (92) the fungus Magnaporthe grisea (66), Homo sapiens (35) and the huge poplar genome (116); and far more than any other bacterial species.",
                        "A distinctive feature of the Sde 2-40 GHs is the prevalence of enzymes that contain both a CBM2 and CBM10, modules that bind to crystalline cellulose. Indeed, as cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide in plant cell walls, this may explain why the cognate degradative enzymes exploit this polymer as a universal receptor. It is interesting to note that a large number of the C. japonicus plant cell wall-degrading GHs, reported to date, also contain CBM2 and/or CBM10 modules, again suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between the marine and terrestrial bacterium that was not anticipated.",
                        "In addition to CBM2s and CBM10s, there is a dramatic expansion of modules in CBM families 6 and 32 in Sde 2-40, which contains 39 and 25 members, respectively. It is likely that the marine environment has imposed selective pressure that has led to the expansion of these two CBM families as several lyases that attack the marine polysaccharide alginate contain CBM32s, while two GH16 agarases contains several CBM6s. Indeed, both CBM families 6 and 32 have been shown to display flexible ligand specificity with the former family recognizing polymers containing D-glucose, D-xylose, D-galactose and 3,6 dehydro-L-galactose [31],[32],[33], while members of the latter family interact with galactose-containing carbohydrates that are modified at C2 (N-acetylgalactosamine) or C6 (galacturonic acid) [34]. As marine polysaccharides contain a wider range of sugars (for example alginate contains D-mannonic acid and L-guluronic acid and agarose contains 3,6 dehydro-L-galactose) than terrestrial plant cell walls, the expansion of family 6 and family 32 CBMs is consistent with the diversity of sugar polymers encountered by Sde 2-40. As C. japonicus does not occupy an environmental niche that contains marine polysaccharides it is unlikely to contain similarly large numbers of family 6 and family CBMs.",
                        "Additionally the Sde 2-40 genome codes for many novel combinations of CBMs and catalytic domains, observed for the first time (see Figures S1, S2, S3, and S4). Many other proteins have modules of unknown function appended to the catalytic domain. Several proteins have two catalytic domains: Sde_3061; Sde_3870; Sde_3003; Sde_3612; Sde_0943; Sde_2873. In Figures S1, S2, S3 and S4 the boxed proteins have CBMs attached to domains of completely unknown function illustrating (i) the benefit of whole genome sequencing (without which it would have been difficult to identify these proteins) and (ii) that our knowledge of the plant cell wall degradome is far from complete. These proteins will therefore constitute targets of choice for subsequent functional studies."

                        "Functional characterizations of the agarase [12], chitinase [35],[36], cellulase [13] and alginase (11 enzymes; [37]) systems of Sde 2-40 showed that each degraded the respective complex polysaccharides to monomers. It was discovered that five agarases were distributed among three GH families (GH16, GH50, GH86; [12]) and that two of the agar depolymerases contained novel CBM6 modules with interesting affinities [33].",
                        "In order to evaluate the expression of each major carbohydrase system during growth on specific carbon sources, transcript levels for genes encoding a selected carbohydrase from each system were estimated by qRT-PCR (Table 4). Each monitored gene exhibited low basal expression during growth on glucose supporting the notion of an operational global catabolite repression mechanism. Transition to another carbon source resulted in a slight increase in expression consistent with release of glucose-dependent catabolite repression. The highest expression, however, was observed on the substrate associated with each carbohydrase. For example, transcript levels for the agarase Aga16B increased 280-fold after 4 hr growth on 0.1% agar. This infers that the expression of each these systems is regulated by signal molecules released from the corresponding substate. Some apparent cross talk between regulatory systems was observed, particularly with those complex polysaccharides that are interlaced with other complex polysaccharides in nature. Thus, growth on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) also induced expression of the monitored xylanase, xyn11A. Similarly growth on xylan induced cel5H expression.",
                        "We also examined enzyme activity in response to sole carbon complex polysaccharide inducers. As in the case of the qRT-PCR studies, we predicted that substrates that signal the presence of complex material, such as the plant cell wall, would trigger a general, extensive enzyme response. In cases where the complex polysaccharide does not occur as a part of a multi- complex polysaccharide complex, it was predicted that enzyme induction would be more specific. As anticipated, growth on Spartina alterniflora leaves induced enzyme activities against all tested substrates (Table 5; Figure 3): crystalline cellulose (Avicel), amorphous cellulose (PASC and CMC), xylan, \u03b2-1,3,4-glucan (barley \u03b2-glucan) and \u03b2-1,3-glucan (laminarin). Interestingly, growth on Avicel and xylan also broadly induced enzymes. These results indicate that cellulose and xylan could function as plant cell wall specific signature molecules, inducing a full suite of degradative enzymes required for deconstruction of plant material. This stands in contrast to the more specific patterns of induction when Sde 2-40 was grown on barley glucan or laminarin. Neither substrate induced activity against xylan or Avicel. The presence of low, but detectable, levels of activity against CMC and laminarin in glucose-grown cultures suggests that the cellulase system of Sde 2-40 utilizes sentinel enzymes, and that these enzymes have activity against \u03b2-1,4- and \u03b2-1,3-glucans.",
                        "We analyzed spent growth media by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify carbohydrases expressed and exported by Sde 2-40 cultivated in avicel or xylan as sole carbon sources. The MS analysis supported the enzyme induction studies. For example, many cellulases and xylanases were induced by their homologous substrate; others, e.g. cellodextrinase Ced3A were induced by several different substrates (Table 6) [38]. From the genomic, qRT-PCR, enzyme activity and MS studies, we conclude that: 1- the Sde 2-40 carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms; 2- the more complicated the polysaccharide complex, the more enzyme systems are induced; 3- glucose repression is a key regulation mechanism.",
                        "The carbohydrases were shown to be functional in microcosms as Sde 2-40 grew on plants as sole carbon sources while fully degrading them, being the first marine prokaryote shown to do so [38]. One line of evidence came from growth studies showing that Sde 2-40 did not grow in minimal medium (MM) lacking a carbon source whereas it underwent numerous generations (g) in MM+0.2% glucose (51 min gt), MM+washed, dried, sterile, Spartina alterniflora leaves (280 min gt), Avicel, xylan or filter paper. Growth was concurrent with pronounced degradation of the plant/CP.",
                        "Notably, Sde 2-40 degraded a variety of cellulositic plants in monoculture rather than as part of a consortium, having ORFs that annotate as putative ligninases including a polyphenol oxidase Sde0315, a tyrosinase Sde0316, and three peroxidases Sde0090, Sde2430, and Sde2810. There was also physiological evidence of Sde 2-40 ligninase activity; for example, it degraded Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and poly B 411, two indicator dyes for fungal ligninase activity."

                        "It is becoming increasingly clear that spatial placement significantly impacts enzyme function. Gram-positive clostridia make cellulosomes, multi-enzyme complexes, mediated by intermodular dockerin/cohesin interactions, which bring to bear an organized array of cellulases to exocellularly depolymerize substrates, conserving both enzyme and substrate [39],[40]. Sde 2-40 utilizes at least one Gram-negative solution to the same problem, i.e. post-translationally modified lipobox domains that anchor proteins to the outer membrane. The database of bacterial lipoproteins (DOLOP) analysis revealed that 34 genes contain lipobox sequences, 31 of which are predicted carbohydrases.",
                        "While lipoprotein-anchors of have been well studied [41],[42],[43] and reported to be a strategy for surface attachment of degradative enzymes [39], the mechanism had only been reported to pertain to only a few proteins per cell. This report is the initial finding of extensive involvement of the motif, encompassing at least one degradase per carbohydrase system including, cellulases (5) [13], pectinases (5), xylanases (5), chitinase(1) [36], agarase (1) [12], laminarinase (1), and mannanase (1). The 34 predicted carbohydrases or CBM proteins which carry lipobox sequences amount to 15% of the total ORFs predicted to degrade or bind carbohydrates in Sde 2-40.",
                        "Furthermore, carbohydrases are believed to be anchored to the outer membrane by more than one mechanism. The cell surface of Sde 2-40 is smooth in its logarithmic phase of growth when growing on glucose [3] and becomes nodulated when growing in CP or are starving (Figure S5). These protuberances could be indicative of protein/protein interactions that anchor certain enzymes at the cell surface. It is interesting to note that two Sde 2-40 ORFs appear to contain dockerin-like motifs and six others contain one or two putative, but distantly related, cohesin-like module(s). In future studies, it will be of interest to explore whether recombinant forms of the dockerins bind to any of the candidate cohesin-like modules, considering Sde 2-40 does not contain a classical cellulosome system."

Sde 2-40 is unique in its array of different carbohydrases, and unusual in its ability to completely mineralize a plant, in pure culture, in marine waters. Given the additional abilities of Sde 2-40 to degrade algal structural polymers (agar and alginate) as well as the invertebrate polysaccharide, chitin, the bacterium may well have an important role in the marine carbon cycle."

Briefly, genomic DNA was randomly sheared with a hydroshear device (Genemachines, San Carlos, CA) and fragments were blunt-end repaired using T4 polymerase and Klenow fragment. Fragments were size selected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pUC18 (\u223c3 kb inserts), pMCL200 (\u223c7 kb inserts) or \u223c35 kb inserts in pCC1Fos (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Ligations were transformed into E.coli DH10B cells and colonies were picked into 384-well plates containing LB and glycerol. DNA for sequencing was produced by rolling circle amplification (Templiphi, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) or Sprintprep (Agencourt, Beverly MA) magnetic bead DNA purification. Subclone inserts were sequenced from both ends using universal primers and ET (GE Healthsciences, Piscataway, NJ) or Big Dye (ABI, Foster City, CA) terminator chemistry. Approximately 144,000 sequence reads were assembled with the Phred/Phrad/Consed software package [44] resulting in approximately 16X coverage of the assembled genome. Finishing was performed by resolving repeats and gap closure using PCR, custom primer reactions, and manual editing. The resulting finished sequence is calculated to contain less than 1 in 50,000 errors with no gaps in the sequence."
