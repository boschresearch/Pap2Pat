    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for detecting an anomalous operating status of a technical system. A training phase obtains a first set of time-series values generated by a digital twin simulation of the technical system for a regular operating status and a second set of time-series values measured by sensors in an anomalous operating status, and adjusts parameters of a machine learning model for detecting the regular operating status and for discriminating data samples of the regular operating status from data samples of the anomalous operating status to generate a trained machine learning model. A monitoring phase obtains a set of multivariate time-series values measured by the sensors, calculates an anomaly score value for determining whether the technical system is in an anomalous operating status based on the obtained set of multi-variate time-series values and the trained machine learning model, and outputs a signal including information on the determined anomalous operating status.",

                        "Detecting a system failure or an undesired operational state in a complex technical system is a difficult technical problem. A complex technical system or a complex machine includes a large number of elements and components. Direct and indirect interdependencies between the individual components usually do not allow an accurate global assessment of a current system status, even if appropriate sensor networks are installed which monitor relevant aspects of the system's operation. The sensor networks generate a large amount of data including sensor values. Inspecting the generated sensor data and the complicated interdependencies between individual components of the system result in a complex and computationally demanding task to decide if a current operating status is an anomalous operating status or undesired operating status on the one hand or a regular operating status on the other hand.",
                        "Generally, component failures or complete system failures need to be avoided as this involves a decreased availability of the technical system, and may lead to a significant increase in cost for operating the system. Often, precursors of component failures or system failures are observable in measured sensor data of a monitoring system designed to supervise the technical system by monitoring its key operating parameters. It is of paramount importance that relevant signals provided by the monitoring system based on the measured operational parameters are inspected and evaluated. A reliable detection of anomalies in the complex technical system is a key requirement to validate the proper function of the system, to detect problems before a component or system failure occurs. The reliable detection of anomalies in the complex technical system enables to schedule maintenance and repair operations of the technical system.",
                        "A fundamental problem in this field is given by the difficulty to produce an approach that captures all relevant instances of anomalous signals. This is the case for a high sensitivity, sometimes called true positive rate, recall, or probability of detection, of the monitoring system that monitors the technical system. Simultaneously, the monitoring system is required to produce only a modest number of false alarms. This corresponds to the monitoring system not identifying too many cases of a regular operating status as an anomalous operating status, usually termed a false positive rate.",
                        "Known rule-based monitoring systems rely on experts in the field implementing a set of checks and balances to ensure a proper operation of the technical system. The rule-based monitoring systems output messages in case of a detected anomaly. It does occur that an anomalous operating status or various anomalous situations are not properly captured by the rules and accordingly remain undetected for an extended period.",
                        "If the rule-based monitoring system relies on rules that are formulated too conservatively, the rule-based monitoring systems will generate many false alarms indicating an anomalous operating status although the monitored system is working in its regular and intended operating status. These false alarms may even overwhelm a human system operator with signals. This may eventually either result in the human system operator ignoring any alarm of the monitoring system, be it indeed a false alarm or a correct information on an anomalous operating status.",
                        "Anomaly detection may use different approaches. A common way relies on utilizing existing expert knowledge in the specific technical field. An expert in the field defines feasible ranges of sensor values and any deviation from these ranges (above a certain threshold) is considered an anomaly. This method has the disadvantage that it is difficult to define and implement rules and error conditions for usually complex technical systems. For complex systems with many interrelated components, the rules itself tend to become more complex.",
                        "Consequently, it is a demanding task to define a set of rules, which captures at least relevant operating states of the technical system properly, and does not include inconsistent or conflicting rules. Additionally, a resource demand for defining these rules and error conditions for large technical systems including many components grows fast.",
                        "An alternate approach to anomaly detection benefits from using the vast increase in simulation capabilities of recent years. Physical simulation models have reached a level of maturity and accuracy that they can replicate a behaviour of the real technical system. This applies in particular to applications, which utilize some real-world sensor data, for example, weather patterns. Such accurate physical simulation models for technical systems are usually termed digital twin simulations. For the purpose of system monitoring and anomaly detection, digital twin simulations can be efficiently used by running a digital twin simulation in parallel to the normal operation of the technical system. Both, the digital twin simulation and the technical system operating in the physical world, share the same environmental input quantities. It is possible to compare sensor measurements from the real, physical technical system to a corresponding output from the digital twin simulator, which allows for the detection of unusual and anomalous states, which might enable to conclude the occurrence of errors in the real technical system.",
                        "Current applications of digital twin simulation technology to industrial applications focus on various aspects like elucidating aging phenomena of the physical machine, support scheduling maintenance operations and enabling predictive maintenance, providing alternatives in what-if-scenarios, aiding business decisions and explorations of new business fields, among others. The publication \u201cLeveraging Digital Twin Technology in Model-Based Systems Engineering\u201d by Madni at al, in: Systems 7(1), 7 (2019) provides examples for this use of digital twin simulation technology.",
                        "Some scenarios employ the digital twin simulation technology running in parallel to the physical technical system with same input values and environmental conditions as the physical technical system. The digital twin simulation outputs a time-series data that can be compared to the corresponding time-series data from the physical technical system. Anomalies in the system behaviour of the technical system may then be detected based on their similarity, for example, as discussed by Filinov et al., in \u201cMultivariate Industrial Time Series with Cyber-Attack Simulation: Fault Detection Using an LSTM-based Predictive Data\u201d, NIPS Time Series Workshop (2016).",
                        "The invention therefore targets the problem of devising an anomaly detection system with an acceptable balance between detection sensitivity and false alarms, which improves the current situation of substantial and continuous fine-tuning of the approaches to achieve the required balance between detection sensitivity and false alarms.",
                        "Data analytics and machine learning techniques have found their way into applications in real-world industrial setting. These apply to anomaly detection methods, which can be utilized for learning characteristics of the sensor data from the real-world technical system. The learned characteristics convey information, which enables to detect anomalies and undesired operating states of the technical system. Different approaches exist to apply machine learning techniques. Unsupervised approaches directly learn the dominant statistics of a measurement data set acquired for the real-world technical system without any a-priori information. There is, however, no explicit information on what an anomaly or an anomalous operating state is, provided to the model. The model makes this distinction based on implicit features of the measurement data. In contrast, supervised approaches for machine learning methods operate with a large training data set. The training data set includes data samples of regular operating states and anomalous operating states that are collected along with labelling information identifying the type of each data sample. Therefore, the models can be trained to learn the characteristics of the training data set and then discriminate between regular operating states and anomalous operating states. The supervised approach requires generating large sets of labelled training data samples, which is resource consuming and therefore involves significant time and cost.",
                        "In a semi-supervised or weakly supervised approach for a machine learning method, a large amount of unlabelled data along with a small set of labelled data is used to train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between regular operating states and anomalous operating states."

The digital twin simulation for the technical system procures (generates, provides) reliably regular operating states of the technical system in a virtual sphere. Additionally, a set of labelled anomaly data samples obtained from the real technical system in a physical sphere is available, which may be significantly smaller in number. The target for the monitoring system is to achieve very high performance for detecting an anomalous operating status with a low false positive and a high true positive rate, while simultaneously only minimal effort for the system operator of the technical system during setup and operation of the monitoring system is required. The central aspect of the invention achieves this target by using large amounts of data from the digital twin simulation. The data can be easily produced with limited human interaction required. The effort to produce the desired small set of anomalous data samples from the real-world physical technical system is also minimal as the few necessary instances of anomalous data samples are often available from the operational history of the technical system.",

This is especially true as a regular large amount of operational data samples from the digital twin simulation enters the training phase of the inventive method. Including the few supervised data samples in the training data set and employing a Siamese auto encoder neural network architecture utilizes all available information on possible machine states without any further effort for the system operator in an efficient manner. The resulting anomaly detection method for the real technical system data has an anomaly detection performance exceeding the performance of state of the art with simultaneously limited effort for the system operator in setting up or initializing the anomaly detection method.",

The time-series values can be\n    flow and return temperatures of the coolant and heating fluid\n    respectively. Further time-series values describe an energy\n    consumption of the heating and cooling devices of the central\n    heating and cooling system;\n  - a plurality of air ventilation devices each including an electric\n    power consumption meter providing further time-series values;\n  - a combined heat and power (CHP or cogeneration) device with sensors\n    providing time-series values for electrical power consumption and\n    thermal power output of the cogeneration device respectively;\n  - a weather sensor device providing weather data such as ambient\n    temperature and air humidity measurement values as time series\n    values;\n  - a photovoltaic system with sensor devices providing time-series\n    values for electrical power generation;\n  - one or more electric vehicle charging stations, each fielding a\n    sensor for generating time-series values for electrical power\n    consumption when charging an electric vehicle;\n  - further appliances and office devices operating on electric power\n    and each or at least those with power consumption in a relevant size\n    with a metering device measuring individual electric power\n    consumption and providing a respective time-series data values.",

An implementation for setting up such time series database may be done using available products such as influxDB, for example.",
                        "Such energy management system may show many different types of anomalous operating states deviating from regular operating states. Types of anomalous operating states (anomalies) that may occur include:\n\n\n- - a sensor failure: a sensor does not provide an output signal. This\n    is a major error as it results data loss. However, the sensor\n    failure is generally easy to detect using standard means.\n  - a machine component fails and the associated sensor provides\n    time-series values with actual value(s) in ranges which are beyond\n    parameter specifications of the measured parameter. For example, the\n    heating system ceases to operate. All measured temperature values\n    will decrease to an ambient temperature value. All heating pumps\n    stop operating. This can be easy to detect.\n  - a sensor provides measurement values, which represent physically\n    impossible data. For example, a volume flow sensor of a heating\n    fluid system shows high fluctuations in time, which is not\n    physically possible since the fluid circulation inside a pipe\n    physically cannot change that fast. This error is difficult to\n    detect as it concerns the statistical properties of a times-series\n    of measured values.\n  - a part of the machinery transitions into one operating status A,\n    while another part goes into an incompatible operating status B. For\n    example, the cooling compressors are not operating due to the\n    absence of a cooling demand, but due to an error, the circulation\n    and ventilation pumps of the cooling system run at high levels.\n  - unpredictable environmental interference. For example, during an\n    on-site visit to a machine room, a human operator spontaneously\n    decides to switch off the cogeneration device installed in this\n    machine room in order to avoid elevated noise levels in the machine\n    room. This is in principle not detectable from regular operating\n    status, except that it then appears that the control mechanism\n    determining an on- and off-switching of the cogeneration device\n    appears to have changed status. However, after the human operator's\n    intervention is reversed, the cogeneration device and the energy\n    management system returns to a regular operating status.",
