    "abstract": "Walnut (Juglans regia L.), that belongs to the Juglandaceae family, is one of the nuts commonly found in Chinese diets. Researchers had obtained peptides from walnut protein hydrolysates, and these peptides exhibited the high antioxidant activities. The objective of this study was to develop a simple and convenient method for a facile and reproducible preparation of antioxidant peptides from walnut protein hydrolysates.Walnut proteins were extracted from walnut kernels using continuous countercurrent extraction process, and were separately hydrolyzed with six types of proteases (neutrase, papain, bromelain, alcalase, pepsin, and pancreatin). Then, hydrolysates were purified by ultrafiltration. The yields and purity of the peptides prepared using neutrase and papain were 16 and 81 % at least, respectively, higher than others, and had low molecular weight, 99 % of which were less than 1500 Da. Furthermore, the bioassay indicated that the two peptides exhibited the high antioxidant activities in the DPPH (IC50 values: 59.40 and 31.02 \u00b5g/mL, respectively), ABTS (IC50 values: 80.36 and 62.22 \u00b5g/mL, respectively), and superoxide radical scavenging assay (IC50 values: 107.47 and 80.00 \u00b5g/mL, respectively).The method combines the advantages of generality, rapidity, simplicity, and is useful for the mass production of walnut peptides.Graphical AbstractPreparation of antioxidant peptides from walnut (Juglans regia L.) protein hydrolysates.",

                "Oxidative stress has been suggested to be a contributory factor in development and complication of diabetes [1\u20133]. Antioxidants have been proven to be benefit human health because they may protect the body against molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which can attack membrane lipids, protein and DNA [4, 5]. Reactive oxygen species are atoms, molecules, or ions with unpaired electrons or open-shell configurations, such as hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), superoxide anion radical (O2\u00b7\u2212) [6, 7]. And their formation has been associated with many human diseases, such as heart disease [8], stroke [9], arteriosclerosis [10], diabetes [11], cancers [12], Alzheimer\u2019s disease [13], and major disorders. Therefore, it is very important to inhibit the formation of the excessive amounts of free radicals in food products and the living body. Synthetic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) may be added to food products to retard oxidation reactions [14, 15]. These synthetic antioxidants show stronger antioxidant activities than those of natural antioxidants, such as \u03b1-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. However, the use of these chemical compounds has begun to be restricted, because of their induction of DNA damage and their toxicity [16]. Thus, there has been a great deal of interest in finding new antioxidants from natural sources to replace synthetic antioxidants for use in food. In the recent years, many studies have reported that hydrolyzed proteins (peptides) from various animal and plant sources possess antioxidant activity [17\u201319]. Antioxidant activity of these peptides was enhanced by the presence of hydrophobic amino acids (proline and leucine) in the N-terminus [20], and hydrophobic amino acids can increase the accessibility of the antioxidant peptides to hydrophobic cellular targets such as the polyunsaturated chain of fatty acids of biological membranes [21].",
                "Walnut (Juglans regia L.), that belongs to the Juglandaceae family, is one of the nuts commonly found in Chinese diets [22, 23]. It is native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia, extending from Xinjiang province of western China [24\u201327]. Walnut is received increasing interest as nutraceutics mainly due to the fact that their regular consumption has been reported to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease [28]. In addition, many biological activities for walnut have been reported, such as antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic properties [29\u201331], and antioxidant activities [32, 33]. The health benefits of walnut are usually attributed to their chemical composition. Numerous benefit compounds can be found in walnut. For example, it contains polyphenols [34], flavones [35], polysaccharides [36], aminophenols [37], minerals [38], and so on. Moreover, each ounce of walnuts offers about 17\u00a0g of fatty acid and contains about 7\u00a0g of protein. Therefore, it is considered a good source of edible oil and proteins. Recently, the use of natural protein hydrolysates has been the subject of several research works, because of their antioxidant potential [39]. Researchers had purified peptides from walnut protein hydrolysates using gel chromatography, and these peptides exhibited the highest antioxidant activities and had angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activity [40, 41]. Every method had its own advantages and disadvantages, so all of these led to our interesting in investigating a large-scale production suitable for walnut peptides.",
                "In the present work, we developed a facile and reproducible preparation of antioxidant peptides from walnut protein hydrolysates. Furthermore, the antioxidant effects of walnut peptides against different free radicals were investigated."

Nowadays, CCCE process is commonly used for large-scale single product plants like in oilseed industry. The process is a simple and efficient continuous extraction, with respect to yield, energy efficiency and level of sanitation [43]. Therefore, our focus is on CCCE process used in the food-processing industry because these systems are most effective in reducing water requirements.",
                        "In the present work, we obtained walnut protein isolates (WPIs) by using CCCE process, and normal process was also used. The comparison of the two methods, CCCE process versus normal process, is summarized in Table\u00a01.Table\u00a01A comparison of CCCE and normal processes for WPIs extractionMethodWalnut flour (g)Water required (mL)Protein yield (%)Protein purity (%)CCCE process600900030.282.5Normal process60018,00031.081.8",
                        "As shown in Table\u00a01, both methods were able to extract WPIs efficiently, and the yields and purity for proteins extracted from walnuts were comparable. The protein yield and purity for CCCE process were 30.2 and 82.5\u00a0%, respectively, while for normal process were 31.0 and 81.8\u00a0%, respectively. However, the volume of water required for normal process was one time more than that for CCCE process. Thus, we did not need so much time to concentrate the protein solutions for CCCE process, which led to energy savings. These findings indicated that CCCE process could reduce production costs greatly, and it was available for WPIs extraction."

Small-size peptides often present an intense biological activity [45]. Therefore, it seems interesting to select purified fractions of peptides of close MW in order to better target their action. Recently, ultrafiltration with high molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) can be used for the separation between peptides and non-hydrolyzed proteins [46].",

The peptide produced by pepsin (WPs-Pep) had low ASPs content (59.33\u00a0%), which revealed that walnut proteins were difficult to be broken down into small-size peptides by pepsin. In contrast, the ASAPs contents of peptides prepared by neutrase (WPs-Neu) and papain (WPs-Pap) were 87.16 and 91.99\u00a0%, respectively.

It was reported that low molecular weight peptides had high solubility, low viscosity, and low allergenicity [45, 48]. These peptides are better candidates than longer peptides to play a physiological role in vivo as they are less susceptible to undergo gastrointestinal hydrolysis [49]. And short peptides may be absorbed easily and transported from the intestinal lumen into the blood circulation more efficiently than either amino acids or intact proteins [50].
