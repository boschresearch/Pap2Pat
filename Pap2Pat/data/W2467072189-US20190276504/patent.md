### Description of Related Art

Walnut is also known as Juglans regia, belongs to one of the four big nuts and has very high nutritional medicinal value. In ancient Chinese medicine books, an explicit record is provided. “Compendium of Materia Medica” written by Li, Shizhen has recorded that the walnut has the functions of tonifying qi and nourishing blood, moistening dryness and reducing phlegm, prolonging the life and clearing heat-dampness in sanjiao, warming the lung and moistening the intestines, treating the lung and moistening the intestines, treating asthenia cold and asthmatic cough, treating swelling and pain of lumbar and foot, treating confidants colic, treating dysentery, and easing swell poison. “Kai Bao Ben Cao” written by Song, Liuhan has described that Juglans regia (namely walnuts) is sweet, flat and non-toxic. It has the effects of promoting the human body to strengthen the spleen, moistening the muscles and blackening hair, taking the pulp and burning the black, and not breaking the smoke and the rosin. “Shi Liao Ben Cao” written by Meng Shen in the Tang Dynasty, and the walnut can be used for dredging meridians and blacking hair, the meat and bone is fine and smooth by regular using. “Shi Jing” written by Cui Yuxi has recorded that it can facilitate urination and remove five hemorrhoids by eating more walnuts. The functions of tonifying the kidney, moistening the door, securing essence and moistening the intestines, clearing away heat and toxic materials, stopping cold and purging deficiency diarrhea and the like were described in the book of “Yi Lin Cuan Yao”.

Walnut contains rich nutrients such as protein, fat and the like, is balanced in content, and belongs to a relatively ideal high protein, the high-fat food. It is reported that the walnut kernels contain up to 52%-70% of fat, which are mostly unsaturated fatty acids, and further contains about 24% of protein and 12-16% of carbohydrate, 1.5%-2% of cellulose and 1.7%-2% of mineral substances. The walnut is rich in amino acid essential to human body, is relatively reasonable in amino acid proportion. The content of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and arginine that have important functions of the human body physiological function are relatively high. And glutamic acid is an important functional substance affecting the intelligence and memory development of the human body, especially the adolescents.

To obtain better oligopeptide powder compared with the original protein of the walnut in the aspect of nutrition, function and biological activity, a plurality of preparation methods have been tried. The method disclosed in CN101228918A comprises the following steps: crushing walnut residue, and extracting the walnut protein by an ultrasonic method, the walnut protein is subjected to vacuum drying, then the walnut protein is subjected to enzymolysis by using protease, and the walnut protein is centrifuged, carrying out dialysis on the supernatant by using a dialysis bag, concentrating the dialysate and carrying out vacuum drying to obtain the peptide powder with the content of 60%-80%. The method is complex in operation, the content of the peptide is low, and the distribution of the molecular weight of the peptide is not clear, meanwhile, the ultrasonic extraction protein is used, the dialysis bag is refined, and large-scale preparation cannot be carried out. The method disclosed in CN102406050 A comprises the following steps: extracting protein by using an alkaline extraction acid precipitation method, and carrying out freeze drying to obtain the walnut protein powder, the protein powder is subjected to enzymolysis, and the protein powder is subjected to high-pressure treatment at 300 MPa for 10 minutes, and freeze-drying to obtain the walnut peptide powder. The preparation method requires ultrahigh pressure equipment and a freeze drier, is high in cost and is not suitable for large-scale production; the molecular weight distribution of the walnut peptide powder prepared by the method is not clear, and the content of the peptide in the product is not clear. The method disclosed in CN103103244 B comprises the following steps: extracting protein by using a method for carrying out acid precipitation by using an alkali extraction acid precipitation method, and carrying out ultrasonic treatment on the protein by using microwaves. The method is still not suitable for large-scale production, and the content of the peptide in the enzymatic hydrolysate is not measured. The Patent CN104293870 A comprises the following steps: firstly, removing grease by using a CO2 supercritical extraction instrument to obtain walnut residue, carrying out alkali extraction and acid precipitation and then spraying to obtain the walnut protein powder, then making the protein powder into turbid liquid, boiling to destroy the structure of the protein, and using alkaline protease, papain, neutral protease and bromelain in a segmented four-step enzymolysis walnut protein solution, 5000 Dalton or 8000 Dalton ultrafiltration membrane is used for refining, and then ion exchange resin desalination is used, and finally spraying and drying to obtain the walnut peptide powder. The patent relates to the application of the supercritical extraction instrument when grease is removed, the cost is increased, and the method is not easy to produce; the four enzymes of the four-step enzymolysis are involved, the steps are tedious, and the cost is high; after the enzymolysis is completed, the micro-filtration membrane is not subjected to impurity removal, the ultra-filtration membrane is directly subjected to an ultrafiltration membrane, so that the ultrafiltration membrane is easy to block, and the ultrafiltration time is prolonged, the yield of the polypeptide is reduced, and meanwhile the service life of the ultrafiltration membrane is shortened. The content of the peptide in the polypeptide product and the molecular weight distribution of the peptide are not involved in the method.

Therefore, the preparation conditions of the walnut polypeptide are rigorous, and the process steps are tedious, large-scale production is difficult to realize. And the simple, low cost and large-scale production method of the walnut polypeptide with relatively high activity and high content has become one of research hotspots.

Cell density passage of 105/ml was carried out. 4 ml of culture solution containing cells was added to each bottle of cells, culturing under the conditions of 37° C. and 5% CO2.

2. Cell Inoculation

The PC12 cells grew to fusion state in a culture bottle, and were digested by using 0.25% trypsin solution, and repeatedly blowing to the cell suspension, diluting into 1.0×105/mL with the high-sugar DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS, 100 μL of each hole is inoculated into 10 complex holes in each group of 96-well culture plates, and culturing for 24 hours under the conditions of 37° C. and 5% CO2, fusion state was obtained.

3. The Influence of the Drug on the Normal PC12 Cell Growth Activity

The 96-well plate was respectively given to 100 μL of the walnut oligopeptide by a certain concentration gradient in each hole, after culturing for 24 hours, the cell vitality was detected by MTT method. 50 mg of MTT was dissolved in 10 ml of PBS and was filtered by 0.22 μm microfiltration membrane. Before being used, it was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml, and culture medium of the each group cell was abandoned, washed twice with PBS. 0.5 mg/ml of MTT was added, carrying out incubation for 3 hours under the conditions of 37° C. and 5% CO2, removing the MTT working solution, and adding 150 μL DMSO into each hole to dissolve, shaking for 10 min, measuring the OD value of each hole (the measurement wavelength was 570 nm, and the reference wavelength was 650 nm). The cell activity of the model group and the drug delivery group was calculated by taking the average value of the OD value of the control group as 100% of the cell activity. The measurement results are shown in Table 2.

4. Protection Effect of the Drug on PC12 Cell by Hydrogen Peroxide Damage (Detecting Whether the Drug Can Remove Free Radicals in the Cells to Promote the Growth of the Cells)

A. Blank group (DMEM for 1% serum).

B. Model group (1% serum DMEM was cultured for 6 hours, then adding H2O2 to enable the final concentration of the H2O2 to be 100 μM, and stimulating for 12 hours).

C. Positive drug (NAC) group: Adding 1% of serum DMEM containing positive drug of a certain concentration to culture for 6 hours, and then the mixture was added with 100 μM H2O2 to stimulate for 12 hours.

D. Administration group: Adding DMEM for 1% serum of the walnut oligopeptide with the concentration gradients to culture for 6 hours, and then the mixture was added with 100 μM H2O2 to stimulate for 12 hours.

The above groups were cultured under the same conditions, and then subsequent experiments were carried out. The cell activity was detected by MTT method in 96-well plates. The measurement results are shown in Table 3.

As can be seen from Table 2, the walnut oligopeptide powder in the invention does not reduce the proliferation activity of PC12 cells, and the number of the PC12 cells is remarkably increased along with the improvement of the concentration. As can be seen from Table 3, the cell activity of the model group is 57.2% after the stimulation of H2O2, and; after 80 μg/mL of the positive control medicine was added for culturing, the cell activity is increased to 88.0%, achieving a significant protection effect. After the walnut oligopeptide was added, the cell activity is increased along with the increasing concentration of the peptide powder, the concentration dependence is presented, and the protection effect is significant. When the concentration was 500 pg/mL, the cell activity reached 72.0%, and the cell activity increased by 30% as compared with the Model group. So the peptide powder has a relatively strong protection effect on neuronal cells, so that it can be used in drugs or health-care foods for preventing or treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, similar diseases, and for relieving brain fatigue.

The mice of scopolamine-induced memory acquisition impairment were administrated with the product of preparation example 1 (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) continuously for 7d. In mice jumping table memory score, the medium-dose group and high-dose group of preparation example 1 can significantly prolong the incubation period, and the number of error was reduced. The result is shown in Table 11.

In mice jumping table memory score, every dose-group of preparation example 1 can significantly prolong the incubation period, and the number of error was reduced. The result is shown in Table 13.

The learning-memory function comprises space learning memory function and non-spatial learning memory function. The memory disorder model is an effective means for evaluating the influence of the medicine on the memory process, and also serves as a model that is commonly used for studying the senile dementia and the action mechanism thereof. Scopolamine is a M-receptor blocker, which may block agonistic action of acetylcholine to M-receptors and stimulating the learning-memory dysfunction caused by insufficient acetylcholine. Sodium nitrite can denature hemoglobin, and causing ischemia and anoxia of the brain tissue, and damaging learning-memory processes. Ethanol may inhibit the neuro-functional activity of cerebral cortex and the conditioned reflex process of the animal, hindering the synthesis of protein and RNA in the brain. Choline may bring some changes to the dopamine system, thereby destroying learning-memory function and causing learning-memory reproduction disorder. In the model and the dosage range selected by the experiment, the medium-dose and high-dose group of walnut oligopeptide can improve incubation period of mice of scopolamine-induced learning-memory acquisition impairment to different degree. For high-dose group, the number of error of jumping from platform can be reduced. For sodium nitrite-induced memory consolidation disorder model, every dose group of walnut oligopeptide can prolong the incubation period, and the number of error can be reduced. In 40% ethanol-induced memory acquisition impairment of mice experiment, every dose group of walnut oligopeptide can significantly prolong the incubation period, and the number of error can be reduced. Therefore, the medium-dose and high-dose group of walnut oligopeptide can have an obvious improvement effect on scopolamine-induced learning-memory ability of mice with learning-memory acquisition impairment. And the low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose group can have a significant improvement effect on 40% ethyl alcohol-induced learning-memory reproduction disorder model of mice and sodium nitrite-induced learning-memory consolidation disorder model of mice.
