    "abstract": "A method and system for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian. The disclosed algorithm may run on any hardware and is suited for early fault tolerant quantum computers. The algorithm employs low-depth quantum circuits with one ancilla qubit with classical post-processing. The algorithm first draws samples from Hadamard tests in which the unitary is a controlled time evolution of the Hamiltonian. The samples are used for evaluating the convolution of the spectral measure and a filter function, and then inferring the ground state energy from this convolution. Quantum circuit depth is linear in the inverse spectral gap and poly-logarithmic in the inverse target accuracy and inverse initial overlap. Runtime is polynomial in the inverse spectral gap, inverse target accuracy, and inverse initial overlap. The algorithm produces a highly-accurate estimate of the ground state energy with reasonable runtime using low-depth quantum circuits. Other properties of a Hamiltonian may also be computed with this method.",

                                "Various physical embodiments of a quantum computer are suitable for use according to the present disclosure. In general, the fundamental data storage unit in quantum computing is the quantum bit, or qubit. The qubit is a quantum-computing analog of a classical digital computer system bit. A classical bit is considered to occupy, at any given point in time, one of two possible states corresponding to the binary digits (bits) 0 or 1. By contrast, a qubit is implemented in hardware by a physical medium with quantum-mechanical characteristics. Such a medium, which physically instantiates a qubit, may be referred to herein as a \u201cphysical instantiation of a qubit,\u201d a \u201cphysical embodiment of a qubit,\u201d a \u201cmedium embodying a qubit,\u201d or similar terms, or simply as a \u201cqubit,\u201d for ease of explanation. It should be understood, therefore, that references herein to \u201cqubits\u201d within descriptions of embodiments of the present invention refer to physical media which embody qubits.",
                                "Each qubit has an infinite number of different potential quantum-mechanical states. When the state of a qubit is physically measured, the measurement produces one of two different basis states resolved from the state of the qubit. Thus, a single qubit can represent a one, a zero, or any quantum superposition of those two qubit states; a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 orthogonal basis states; and three qubits can be in any superposition of 8 orthogonal basis states. The function that defines the quantum-mechanical states of a qubit is known as its wavefunction. The wavefunction also specifies the probability distribution of outcomes for a given measurement. A qubit, which has a quantum state of dimension two (i.e., has two orthogonal basis states), may be generalized to a d-dimensional \u201cqudit,\u201d where d may be any integral value, such as 2, 3, 4, or higher. In the general case of a qudit, measurement of the qudit produces one of d different basis states resolved from the state of the qudit. Any reference herein to a qubit should be understood to refer more generally to an d-dimensional qudit with any value of d.",
                                "Although certain descriptions of qubits herein may describe such qubits in terms of their mathematical properties, each such qubit may be implemented in a physical medium in any of a variety of different ways. Examples of such physical media include superconducting material, trapped ions, photons, optical cavities, individual electrons trapped within quantum dots, point defects in solids (e.g., phosphorus donors in silicon or nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), molecules (e.g., alanine, vanadium complexes), or aggregations of any of the foregoing that exhibit qubit behavior, that is, comprising quantum states and transitions therebetween that can be controllably induced or detected.",
                                "For any given medium that implements a qubit, any of a variety of properties of that medium may be chosen to implement the qubit. For example, if electrons are chosen to implement qubits, then the x component of its spin degree of freedom may be chosen as the property of such electrons to represent the states of such qubits. Alternatively, the y component, or the z component of the spin degree of freedom may be chosen as the property of such electrons to represent the state of such qubits. This is merely a specific example of the general feature that for any physical medium that is chosen to implement qubits, there may be multiple physical degrees of freedom (e.g., the x, y, and z components in the electron spin example) that may be chosen to represent 0 and 1. For any particular degree of freedom, the physical medium may controllably be put in a state of superposition, and measurements may then be taken in the chosen degree of freedom to obtain readouts of qubit values.",
                                "Certain implementations of quantum computers, referred to as gate model quantum computers, comprise quantum gates. In contrast to classical gates, there is an infinite number of possible single-qubit quantum gates that change the state vector of a qubit. Changing the state of a qubit state vector typically is referred to as a single-qubit rotation, and may also be referred to herein as a state change or a single-qubit quantum-gate operation. A rotation, state change, or single-qubit quantum-gate operation may be represented mathematically by a unitary 2\u00d72 matrix with complex elements. A rotation corresponds to a rotation of a qubit state within its Hilbert space, which may be conceptualized as a rotation of the Bloch sphere. (As is well-known to those having ordinary skill in the art, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the space of pure states of a qubit.) Multi-qubit gates alter the quantum state of a set of qubits. For example, two-qubit gates rotate the state of two qubits as a rotation in the four-dimensional Hilbert space of the two qubits. (As is well-known to those having ordinary skill in the art, a Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.)",
                                "A quantum circuit may be specified as a sequence of quantum gates. As described in more detail below, the term \u201cquantum gate,\u201d as used herein, refers to the application of a gate control signal (defined below) to one or more qubits to cause those qubits to undergo certain physical transformations and thereby to implement a logical gate operation. To conceptualize a quantum circuit, the matrices corresponding to the component quantum gates may be multiplied together in the order specified by the gate sequence to produce a 2n\u00d72n complex matrix representing the same overall state change on n qubits. A quantum circuit may thus be expressed as a single resultant operator. However, designing a quantum circuit in terms of constituent gates allows the design to conform to a standard set of gates, and thus enable greater ease of deployment. A quantum circuit thus corresponds to a design for actions taken upon the physical components of a quantum computer.",

More generally, the quantum gates making up a quantum circuit may have an associated plurality of tuning parameters. For example, in embodiments based on optical switching, tuning parameters may correspond to the angles of individual optical elements.",
                                "In certain embodiments of quantum circuits, the quantum circuit includes both one or more gates and one or more measurement operations. Quantum computers implemented using such quantum circuits are referred to herein as implementing \u201cmeasurement feedback.\u201d For example, a quantum computer implementing measurement feedback may execute the gates in a quantum circuit and then measure only a subset (i.e., fewer than all) of the qubits in the quantum computer, and then decide which gate(s) to execute next based on the outcome(s) of the measurement(s). In particular, the measurement(s) may indicate a degree of error in the gate operation(s), and the quantum computer may decide which gate(s) to execute next based on the degree of error. The quantum computer may then execute the gate(s) indicated by the decision. This process of executing gates, measuring a subset of the qubits, and then deciding which gate(s) to execute next may be repeated any number of times. Measurement feedback may be useful for performing quantum error correction, but is not limited to use in performing quantum error correction. For every quantum circuit, there is an error-corrected implementation of the circuit with or without measurement feedback.",
                                "Some embodiments described herein generate, measure, or utilize quantum states that approximate a target quantum state (e.g., a ground state of a Hamiltonian). As will be appreciated by those trained in the art, there are many ways to quantify how well a first quantum state \u201capproximates\u201d a second quantum state. In the following description, any concept or definition of approximation known in the art may be used without departing from the scope hereof. For example, when the first and second quantum states are represented as first and second vectors, respectively, the first quantum state approximates the second quantum state when an inner product between the first and second vectors (called the \u201cfidelity\u201d between the two quantum states) is greater than a predefined amount (typically labeled \u03f5). In this example, the fidelity quantifies how \u201cclose\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d the first and second quantum states are to each other. The fidelity represents a probability that a measurement of the first quantum state will give the same result as if the measurement were performed on the second quantum state. Proximity between quantum states can also be quantified with a distance measure, such as a Euclidean norm, a Hamming distance, or another type of norm known in the art. Proximity between quantum states can also be defined in computational terms. For example, the first quantum state approximates the second quantum state when a polynomial time-sampling of the first quantum state gives some desired information or property that it shares with the second quantum state.",

The quantum computer 252 prepares a well-known initial state 266 (FIG. 2B, operation 264), such as a quantum-mechanical superposition of all possible states (candidate states) with equal weights, based on the initial Hamiltonian 260. The classical computer 254 provides the initial Hamiltonian 260, a final Hamiltonian 262, and an annealing schedule 270 to the quantum computer 252. The quantum computer 252 starts in the initial state 266, and evolves its state according to the annealing schedule 270 following the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, a natural quantum-mechanical evolution of physical systems (FIG. 2B, operation 268). More specifically, the state of the quantum computer 252 undergoes time evolution under a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which starts from the initial Hamiltonian 260 and terminates at the final Hamiltonian 262. If the rate of change of the system Hamiltonian is slow enough, the system stays close to the ground state of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. If the rate of change of the system Hamiltonian is accelerated, the system may leave the ground state temporarily but produce a higher likelihood of concluding in the ground state of the final problem Hamiltonian, i.e., diabatic quantum computation. At the end of the time evolution, the set of qubits on the quantum annealer is in a final state 272, which is expected to be close to the ground state of the classical Ising model that corresponds to the solution to the original computational problem 258.

Applying a gate to one or more qubits causes the set of qubits to undergo a physical state change which embodies a corresponding logical gate operation (e.g., single-qubit rotation, two-qubit entangling gate or multi-qubit operation) specified by the received gate control signal. As this implies, in response to receiving the gate control signals, the qubits 104 undergo physical transformations which cause the qubits 104 to change state in such a way that the states of the qubits 104, when measured (see below), represent the results of performing logical gate operations specified by the gate control signals.

The measurement unit 110 may repeat such measurement operations on the qubits 104 before the control unit 106 generates additional control signals 108, thereby causing the measurement unit 110 to read out additional measurement signals 112 resulting from the same gate operations that were performed before reading out the previous measurement signals 112. The measurement unit 110 may repeat this process any number of times to generate any number of measurement signals 112 corresponding to the same gate operations.
