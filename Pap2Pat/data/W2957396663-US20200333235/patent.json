                        "Circulating cancer cells (CTCs) refer to a small fraction of cells in patient blood resembling the cells of the primary tumor (Ashworth, T., Aust Med J., 1869. 14: p. 146). These cells circulate in the bloodstream after being shed from the tumor site. CTCs belong to a class of extremely rare cells (as low as 1 in 109 erythrocytes and 1 in 107 leukocytes) which makes detection and analysis of CTCs challenging (Baccelli, I.n., et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2013. 31(6): p. 539; Viraka Nellore, B. P., et al., Bioconjugate chemistry, 2015. 26(2): p. 235-242.). CTCs have been found in the majority of epithelial cancers, including those from colon, breast, lung, and prostate. Although CTCs are rare in quantity, the analysis of CTCs is extraordinarily promising. They serve as a prognostic marker and likely to be the precursor for the formation of secondary tumors during metastasis. In addition, CTC analysis provides insight into treatment effectiveness and can facilitate the discovery of biomarkers to monitor treatment response.",
                        "With rapid advances in oncology, microfluidics, and medicine, CTC detection, isolation, and characterization technologies have shown promising results and have attracted more attention. The most commonly used method for CTC isolation relies on antibody-based capture of CTCs. CTCs express epithelial cell surface markers that are absent from normal leukocytes. The VERIDEX CELLSEARCH system (NJ, USA) is a commercially available system approved by FDA that uses cell surface antigen, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), to identify target cells (e.g., CTCs). However, this system is not widely used because the system is expensive and suffers from low sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, the purity of captured CTCs is very low (Xiong, K., et al., Advanced Materials, 2016. 28(36): p. 7929-7935.). Nagrath et al. developed a unique microfluidic CTC chip that utilizes an array of microposts which are functionalized with anti-EpCAM antibodies which allowed longitudinal monitoring of patients during therapy and molecular characterization of CTCs (Nagrath, S., et al., Nature, 2007. 450(7173): p. 1235.). In addition to CTCs, the ability to classify and quantify different types of blood cells can be used as biomarkers for various chronic and acute conditions. This includes red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells with differentials. Quantification of white blood cell differentials (e.g., Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) can provide information as to whether an infection is viral or bacterial and also can be useful for risk stratification of sepsis patients and COVID19 infected patients. Physical properties to distinguish CTCs from blood have been vastly explored. These properties include cell size, shape, charge, deformability, and density. Filtration, hydrodynamic chromatography, dielectrophoresis, and inertial microfluidics have shown promising results and avoid the use of cell surface antigens.",
                        "A key challenge in utilizing physical properties of CTCs is that the inherent heterogeneity of CTCs causes a significant overlap of physical properties with leukocytes. This results in leukocyte contamination in the output sample. Thus, there remains a strong need for methods and systems capable of detecting or classifying biological particles, such as CTCs."

Neural networks are constructed of processing elements known as neurons. Neurons are interconnected and arranged in a plurality of layers. Each neuron can have multiple inputs but generally only one output, which, in turn, is usually connected to many or all other neurons in the next layer. Neural networks learn by extracting relational information from the data and the desired output. A neural network in the machine learning module is initially trained or fed large amounts of data. Data reflecting amplitude and/or phase of the impedance response at one or more frequencies of individual types of biological particles can be fed to the neural network during the training stage. After the training stage, the resulting neural network is capable of determining the type of individual biological particle, thus enabling the system to classify biological particles based on their physical properties, such as electrical properties. In some embodiments, the machine learning module may employ a plurality of neural networks, which may be organized either in series, in parallel, or in a nested fashion. In this example, the neural networks are arranged in a tree pattern or in a hierarchical structure, with each neural network trained to perform a particular pattern recognition task.

The current peak at 500 KHz is affected primarily by cell diameter, while the current peak at 2 MHz is a product of the cells internal properties such as membrane thickness and cytoplasm conductivity and dielectric constant.

The sample can be a sample of serum, urine plasma, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, cells (e.g., antibody-producing cells) or tissue. Such a sample can be used directly as obtained from a patient or can be pre-treated, such as by filtration, distillation, extraction, concentration, centrifugation, inactivation of interfering components, addition of reagents, and the like, to modify the character of the sample in some manner as discussed herein or otherwise as is known in the art. The terms \u201csample\u201d and \u201cbiological sample\u201d as used herein generally refer to a biological material being tested for and/or suspected of containing an analyte of interest such as antibodies.

A tissue or cell type may be provided by removing a sample of cells from an animal, but can also be accomplished by using previously isolated cells (e.g., isolated by another person, at another time, and/or for another purpose). Archival tissues, such as those having treatment or outcome history, may also be used. Protein purification may not be necessary.",

The test sample can comprise further moieties in addition to the analyte of interest, such as antibodies, antigens, haptens, hormones, drugs, enzymes, receptors, proteins, peptides, polypeptides, oligonucleotides or polynucleotides. For example, the sample can be a whole blood sample obtained from a subject. It can be necessary or desired that a test sample, particularly whole blood, be treated prior to immunoassay as described herein, e.g., with a pretreatment reagent. Even in cases where pretreatment is not necessary, pretreatment optionally can be done for mere convenience (e.g., as part of a regimen on a commercial platform). The sample may be used directly as obtained from the subject or following a pretreatment to modify a characteristic of the sample. Pretreatment may include extraction, concentration, inactivation of interfering components, and/or the addition of reagents.",

Usually, a diagnosis of a disease or disorder is based on the evaluation of one or more factors and/or symptoms that are indicative of the disease. That is, a diagnosis can be made based on the presence, absence or amount of a factor which is indicative of the presence or absence of the disease or condition. Each factor or symptom that is considered to be indicative of the diagnosis of a particular disease does not need to be exclusively related to the particular disease; i.e., there may be differential diagnoses that can be inferred from a diagnostic factor or symptom. Likewise, there may be instances where a factor or symptom that is indicative of a particular disease is present in an individual that does not have a particular disease.

Prognosis is usually made by evaluating factors or symptoms of a disease that are indicative of a favorable or unfavorable course or outcome of the disease. The phrase \u201cdetermining the prognosis\u201d as used herein refers to the process by which the skilled artisan can predict the course or outcome of a condition in a patient. The term \u201cprognosis\u201d does not refer to the ability to predict the course or outcome of a condition with 100% accuracy instead, the skilled artisan will understand that the term \u201cprognosis\u201d refers to an increased probability that a certain course or outcome will occur; that is, that a course or outcome is more likely to occur in a patient exhibiting a given condition, when compared to those individuals not exhibiting the condition.",
