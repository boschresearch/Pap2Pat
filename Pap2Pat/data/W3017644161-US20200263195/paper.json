    "title": "Novel Non-integrating DNA Nano-S/MAR Vectors Restore Gene Function in Isogenic Patient-Derived Pancreatic Tumor Models",

    "abstract": "We describe herein non-integrating minimally sized nano-S/MAR DNA vectors, which can be used to genetically modify dividing cells in place of integrating vectors. They represent a unique genetic tool, which avoids vector-mediated damage. Previous work has shown that DNA vectors comprising a mammalian S/MAR element can provide persistent mitotic stability over hundreds of cell divisions, resisting epigenetic silencing and thereby allowing sustained transgene expression. The composition of the original S/MAR vectors does present some inherent limitations that can provoke cellular toxicity. Herein, we present a new system, the nano-S/MAR, which drives higher transgene expression and has improved efficiency of establishment, due to the minimal impact on cellular processes and perturbation of the endogenous transcriptome. We show that these features enable the hitherto challenging genetic modification of patient-derived cells to stably restore the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 to a patient-derived SMAD4 knockout pancreatic cancer line. Nano-S/MAR modification does not alter the molecular or phenotypic integrity of the patient-derived cells in cell culture and xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, we show that these DNA vectors can be used to persistently modify a range of cells, providing sustained transgene expression while avoiding the risks of insertional mutagenesis and other vector-mediated toxicity.",

                "Rescuing the function of mutated genes in tumor cells can help to define their molecular role and provide an insight into their interactions and the processes that drive the transformation of a normal cell toward cancer without disturbing other cellular processes. A variety of different methods have been developed to generate genetically modified tumor cells, and the most effective system for delivering genes to cells is based on the use of vectors derived from modified viruses.1 However, despite the advantages of these vectors, they also have significant limitations mainly related to their random integration into the cellular genome, the potential immunogenicity of virally encoded genes, as well as the silencing of the transgenic material over time. Each unintended consequence of genetic engineering is likely to mask or interfere with the molecular analysis of the genetic restoration. It is therefore imperative that the genetic modification has only a minimal vector-mediated impact on the molecular behavior of a cell, particularly when working with primary or patient-derived cells that are more likely to react against foreign genetic material. Previous work has established that DNA vectors comprising a nuclear scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) element and mammalian promoters allow long-term transgene expression in cancer cell lines, both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.2, 3, 4 S/MARs mediate the binding of episomal vectors to the chromosomal scaffold during mitosis, providing sustained expression and mitotic stability over hundreds of cell divisions.5,6 In the context of minicircle vectors, these motifs lead to a higher and more sustained transgene expression when compared to conventional plasmids, presumably due to the lack of bacterial sequences often characterized by the presence of CpG dinucleotides, responsible for the initiation of the vector silencing.7 Nevertheless, the production of minicircles is a laborious process that implies intramolecular recombination8 followed by purification steps designated to separate the producer vector from the minicircle. To overcome these problems, an alternative antibiotic-free selection system was established by Luke et\u00a0al.9 for the production of minimally sized plasmids. As minicircles, these antibiotic-free (AF) selectable vectors combine a highly productive fermentation (>1 g/L plasmid DNA yield) and enhanced transgene expression when compared to respective plasmids with antibiotic selection.10, 11, 12 Herein, we describe the incorporation of the S/MAR sequence previously described by Piechaczek et\u00a0al.13 into plasmids containing an optimized bacterial backbone (pS/MAR) and minimalistic AF vectors (nS/MAR). In this study, we directly compare plasmid vectors to nanovectors and show that nS/SMAR DNA vectors produce more robust transgene expression and have a higher efficacy in the episomal establishment of dividing cells, and we report on their application for the genetic modification of primary pancreatic cancer (PC) cells with a particular focus on vector-mediated toxicity and an analysis of the molecular integrity of the engineered cells. Herein, we report that this new class of DNA vectors has a minimal impact on the target cell genome and that they are capable of providing sustained genetic supplementation of the tumor suppressor SMAD4 in primary pancreatic cancer models in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We conclude that this system can be considered a potent tool for the generation of reliable cancer models."

                        "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most lethal types of cancer,14 with a mortality rate second only to lung cancer.15,16 A simple and effective method to generate reliable tumor models is therefore necessary to further understand this disease. For our initial study, we used the pS/MAR DNA vector system to modify the pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 stably in\u00a0vitro. We generated the pS/MAR-luciferase (pS/MAR-Luc) and the pS/MAR-SMAD4-luciferase (pS/MAR-SMAD4-Luc) vectors that were used to produce the stable cell lines Capan-1 luciferase and Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc. The tumor suppressor SMAD4 (DPC4 [deleted in pancreatic cancer 4]) was chosen as a model, as its loss is one of the best characterized events in pancreatic cancer development.17 In the modified cell populations, the expression of SMAD4 was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot (Figure\u00a01A), and its functional rescue was demonstrated through the activation of the SMAD4-dependent genes SnaiL18 and p2119,20 (Figure\u00a0S1). Next, we analyzed the impact of SMAD4 restoration in in\u00a0vivo tumor growth by injecting CAPAN-1 luciferase or CAPAN-1 SMAD4-Luc cells orthotopically into the pancreas of NSG mice. SMAD4 expression was robustly maintained (Figure\u00a01D), and, as previously described,21 its functional rescue leads to a reduction in tumor growth (Figure\u00a01B). All mice injected with parental or luciferase control cells developed invasive primary tumors, while those injected with SMAD4-restored tumor cells showed small and non-invasive accumulations of transplanted cells (Figure\u00a01C). Both DNA vectors used for the modification of these cells expressed the reporter gene luciferase, which allowed the interrogation of the presence of disseminated cells in the injected mice. Whereas control Capan-1 luciferase formed metastasis in the liver and the lungs, no metastatic events were observed in mice injected with SMAD4-restored cells (Figure\u00a0S2A). Histopathological analysis revealed that Capan-1 luciferase cells developed tumors (Figure\u00a01C) phenotypically similar to those formed from the unmodified parental tumor cell line, characterized by a differentiated ductal structure. In contrast, cells expressing SMAD4 formed primary tumors that appeared less differentiated with higher recruitment of stromal cells as previously reported.22 As the Capan-1 luciferase and parental cells generated identical primary tumors and retained a similar metastatic potential (Figure\u00a0S2B), the differences observed in the tumor masses generated by Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells together with the restriction of their metastatic potential appear to be entirely dependent on the restoration of the tumor suppressor gene. Primary tumors from Capan-1 luciferase and Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cell lines were compared for the phenotype (Figure\u00a01A), proliferation with the staining of Ki67 (Figure\u00a01B), and expression of SMAD4 (Figures 1C and 1D). Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc tumors showed a lower proliferative rate, as estimated by Ki67 expression, explaining the smaller tumor size achieved. Positive staining for SMAD4 confirmed the DNA vector activity and capability of providing sustained transgene expression following orthotropic injection and tumor development.Figure\u00a01Delivery of pS/MAR-SMAD4 DNA Vectors Rescues the Tumorigenic Phenotype of SMAD4 Mutant Pancreatic Cancer Cell LinespS/MAR-luciferase (pS/MAR Luc) and pS/MAR-SMAD4-luciferase (pS/MAR SMAD4-Luc) DNA vectors were generated by introducing the transgene expression cassettes under the control of the ubiquitin C promoter (UbiC). (A) The expression of SMAD4 in modified Capan-1 was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot in comparison to HEK293T cells, which constitutively express SMAD4. The impact of SMAD4 in the tumor growth was evaluated in\u00a0vivo by injecting 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 Capan-1 cells expressing either the reporter gene luciferase or a combination of SMAD4 and luciferase orthotopically into the pancreas of NSG mice. (B) Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells generated significantly smaller tumors than did Capan-1 luciferase (n\u00a0= 4 per group analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.0141). (C) Histopathological analysis reveals that the luciferase-modified cells developed a tumor with identical morphology as those formed from the parental cell line, while the rescue of SMAD4 induces profound changes. (D) Capan-1 luciferase and Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc-derived tumors were assessed for histology by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), proliferation (Ki67), and SMAD4 expression."

                        "Next, we investigated the molecular changes occurring in the cells provoked by the vector and by the reintroduction of SMAD4. To this end, we performed genome-wide RNA profile analysis of the primary tumors formed by parental, control-luciferase, or SMAD4-Luc Capan-1 cells. The expression profiles of 351 genes were perturbed in Capan-1 luciferase cells when compared to the parental control cell (\u00b12-fold, p\u00a0< 0.05; Table S1; Figure\u00a02A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to understand better the interaction between the vector and the cellular genome, which revealed enrichment for the hallmarks associated with several inflammatory responses such as a signature response to interferon-\u03b1 (Figure\u00a02C). The interferon-\u03b1 pathway is associated with the cellular immune response to viral infection. It is part of the innate immunity, and it is triggered by cytoplasmic proteins that recognize an infectious agent\u2019s genome during its translocation into the nucleus. The fact that these signatures appeared enriched in the analysis suggested that pS/MAR was also recognized as a foreign entity and its presence induced an inflammatory state. The reintroduction of functional SMAD4 was accompanied by the dysregulation of 825 genes (\u00b12-fold, p\u00a0< 0.05) when compared to Capan-1 parental cells. Of those, only 189 genes (Figure\u00a02B) were specific for Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells when compared to Capan-1 luciferase control cells. GSEA analysis revealed strong enrichment in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes and the apoptotic hallmark signatures (Figure\u00a02D), in line with previous reports where ex\u00a0vivo rescue of SMAD4 in mouse or human pancreatic cancer cells functionally induced the EMT transition that leads the apoptosis and cell death.22 In accordance with Liu et\u00a0al.23 and C\u00e2mara et\u00a0al.,24 also in Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells EMT markers such as vimentin and fibronectin were shown to be upregulated in comparison to Capan-1 luciferase and parental cells (Figure\u00a0S3). Although a significant number of genes were found to be perturbed in Capan-1 luciferase cells, they had limited influence on the cells\u2019 behavior\u00a0during tumor development and/or the metastatic process in the experimental setting. In contrast, the interruption of cancer\u00a0development, as well as the phenotypic changes observed in the Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells, can be attributed to the rescue of SMAD4.Figure\u00a02Genome-wide Transcriptome Analysis of modified Capan-1 cells(A and B) Volcano plots showing the gene expression changes of Capan-1 luciferase versus Capan-1 parental (A) and Capan-1 SMAD4-luciferase versus Capan-1 luciferase (B).

                        "We previously showed the successful restoration of the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 into Capan-1 cells using the non-integrative pS/MAR DNA vector system. Although macroscopically the model reflected the results described in the literature,25 microarray analysis showed that the plasmid vector itself had a strong impact on the transcriptome of the cells. We reasoned that these effects are a consequence of the presence of bacterial sequences in the vector, such as the origin of replication and the selection marker. These may lead to the inflammatory responses observed. To overcome this problem, we decided to introduce the S/MAR sequence derived from the human \u03b2-interferon gene cluster26 into an optimized minimally sized antibiotic-free (AF) plasmid9\u2014the nano-S/MAR vector (nS/MAR). Figure\u00a03A represents a schematic depiction of the plasmid. The S/MAR sequence was placed after an expression cassette in which the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter drives the expression of the reporter gene GFP and the antibiotic selection puromycin (Puro) divided by the P2A linker sequence. The position of the S/MAR within the vector was determined by the work of Stehle et\u00a0al.,27 where they demonstrated that an active transcription upstream of the S/MAR running into this sequence was required for episomal replication and long-term vector maintenance.28 A control vector named pS/MAR was also generated. This plasmid contained an identical expression cassette and S/MAR composition along with a bacterial backbone comprising the pUC origin of replication and a kanamycin antibiotic resistance gene. HEK293T cells were transfected with nS/MAR and pS/MAR vectors, and their capacity to establish stable cells was evaluated in a colony-forming assay as previously described29 (Figure\u00a03B). The nS/MAR vector generated a significantly higher (p\u00a0= 0.0003) number of established cells that were also characterized by a significantly higher level (p\u00a0< 0.0001) of transgene expression (Figure\u00a03C). The molecular integrity and episomal maintenance of both nS/MAR and pS/MAR vectors in the established cell populations were determined 35\u00a0days after DNA delivery by Southern blot (Figure\u00a03D) where DNA isolated from the modified cells was compared to linearized control vectors. The absence of smears or alternative bands to those that matched the size of the control vectors confirms the stable maintenance of the plasmids as well as their extrachromosomal replication and transmission during cell division.Figure\u00a03Nano-S/MAR Has Improved Establishment Efficiency, Sustains Higher Transgene Expression, and Is Maintained Episomally in the Nuclei of Target Cells(A) Schematic depiction of pS/MAR and nS/MAR DNA vectors.

                        "To evaluate the efficacy of the new nS/MAR vectors, we utilized a well-described and representative patient-derived xenografted (PDX) pancreatic cancer cell line.30 These cells, named PACO2, were derived from an aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by the orthotopic expansion of a patient\u2019s tumor biopsy in NSG mice and further isolation and culture of the epithelial tumor cells. The cells have been maintained at low passage in carefully controlled media and have been characterized to closely represent the primary tumor cells from which they are derived.30 These cells provide an ideal platform to test the nS/MAR system because of their chronic, high levels of anti-pathogenic cytokines such as interferon that make them a challenge to transfect with typical plasmids, which carry a traditional bacterial backbone. PACO2 cells carry a mutation in their SMAD4 locus, which allowed us to test the rescue of this tumor suppressor gene in these PDX cells.",
                        "First, both pS/MAR-GFP and nS/MAR-GFP DNA vectors were transfected into PACO2 cells. The transfection efficiency and the viability of the cells were then assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure\u00a04A). Strikingly, the nS/MAR-GFP vector performed significantly better than the pS/MAR-GFP plasmids, demonstrating that these vectors can be efficiently delivered to primary human cells, which are typically refractory to transfection. The cells also retained high viability compared to cells transfected with the pS/MAR DNA vector throughout this procedure. Using the nS/MAR technology, we then generated two different engineered PACO2 cell lines: PACO2\u00a0nS/MAR-GFP (PACO-2 GFP) cells, which express the reporter gene, and PACO2\u00a0nS/MAR-SMAD4-GFP (PACO-2 SMAD4-GFP) cells, in which the expression of SMAD4 is coupled via a P2A sequence to the GFP. After 30\u00a0days the modified cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of the reporter gene GFP (Figure\u00a04B), which showed that the PACO2 GFP cells produced high levels of transgene expression (Figure\u00a04C). The\u00a0reintroduction of SMAD4 was confirmed by western blot (Figure\u00a04C) using Panc-1, a pancreatic cancer cell line with no mutation or loss of the SMAD4 genetic locus, as a control reference. The molecular integrity and episomal stability of the nanovectors in modified primary cells were determined via Southern blot (Figure\u00a0S4) where the presence of single sharp bands of the expected size confirmed the extrachromosomal maintenance and episomal segregation of these plasmids in dividing cells.Figure\u00a04Genetic Modification of Primary Pancreatic Tumor Cells (PACO2) Using nS/MAR DNA Vector TechnologypS/MAR and nS/MAR vectors expressing the reporter gene GFP were transferred into PACO2 cells through electroporation.

For this, genome-wide RNA profile analysis of the established GFP and SMAD4-GFP PACO2 cells, as well as the parental lines, were performed. Four biological replicates were prepared for each cell line 1\u00a0month after DNA delivery, and the differences in the relative gene expression profiles of each were evaluated. Strikingly, the nS/MAR-GFP vector had a minimal impact on the cells (Figure\u00a04D) with only two genes having appeared significantly perturbed\u00a0\u00b12-fold (p\u00a0< 0.05; Table S3).

The weight of the pancreas was used as a measure of tumor growth, and we showed that mice injected with PACO2 cells had significantly lighter organs than did animals injected with the control cell lines (n\u00a0= 10 for PACO2 parental, n\u00a0= 12 for PACO2 GFP and SMAD4 analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey\u2019s post hoc test for multiple comparisons).

The tumors formed from PACO2 modified with the reporter gene GFP showed a defined ductal differentiation typical of pancreatic cancers with a high proliferate rate and negative expression for SMAD4 identical to unmodified parental PACO2 cells. (E) Cells where SMAD4 functionality was restored did not form tumors when engrafted into mice.

Additionally, every (10/10) mouse treated with PACO2 parental cells formed tumors in their pancreas, and 4/10 also developed masses in the abdominal cavity. This markedly contrasts with only 2/12 mice injected with PACO2 SMAD4-GFP developing primary tumors in their pancreas, and none showing cells outgrowing into their abdominal cavity (Figure\u00a0S5). The total weight of the pancreases was used as a measure of tumor growth, and mice injected with the SMAD4-restored cells had significantly smaller tumors than did mice injected with the unmodified parental line and GFP cell line (Figure\u00a05C). Tumors formed by PACO2 GFP cells presented similar morphology to those created with the unmodified parental PACO2 cells (Figure\u00a05D) with tumorous ductal glands and extensive fibrosis. They showed active proliferation and were characterized by the absence of SMAD4 expression. Histological analysis of the few tumors that grew in the pancreas of mice injected with PACO2 SMAD4-GFP cells revealed that these tumors were derived from most likely cells that do not express SMAD4 and they were actively proliferating (Ki67 positive) (Figure\u00a05E). Moreover, their morphology matched those of PACO2 GFP and PACO2 parental cells. PACO2 cells modified with the reporter gene maintained their original behavior, demonstrating that the episomal nS/MAR vector had no effect on the behavior of the cells or their molecular integrity. Therefore, the observed impact on the SMAD4 rescued cells can be fully attributed to the restored functionality of the tumor suppressor gene."

                "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is considered one of the most malignant types of cancer with relatively late detection and poor prognosis,14 with only 10%\u201315% of patients eligible for surgery, which is currently the only curative option.31 Several methods have been developed to unravel the genetic basis of PDA ranging from the generation of transgenic mouse models32 to the in\u00a0vitro modification of cancer cell lines and explanted primary cells. The in\u00a0vitro or ex\u00a0vivo genetic modification of cells relies on the use of integrating vectors to generate cells that can persistently and stably express a gene of interest through cell division. These systems are mostly represented by integrating viral vectors such as lentivirus that take advantage of the integrating nature of the virus to transfer the genetic material into the cellular genome. In this process, the integration of the gene of interest happens randomly into the target cells, which may result in unstable transgene expression over time. The necessity of adequate facilities for viral handling as well as the laborious process necessary for their preparation and purification make these vectors not the ideal tool to swiftly generate tumor models. Then, viral antigens and nucleic acids can trigger the cellular immune response against infectious agents that generate undesired perturbation in the cellular and molecular behavior, leading to a high background during the studies. S/MAR vectors are a unique class of DNA constructs that can provide long-term transgene expression and mitotic stability in mammalian cells without relying on toxic viral components or random integration that can potentially disrupt the molecular behavior of the targeted cells. In this study, the pS/MAR vector was engineered with the aim of generating pancreatic cancer tumor models with a particular application of the rescue of the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4. The loss of SMAD4 is one of the best characterized events in pancreatic cancer development. In approximately 30% of all pancreatic cancers, SMAD4 is homozygously deleted, and another 20% display missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. The downregulation of SMAD4 counteracts TGF-\u03b2-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, but the restoration of this tumor suppressor gene can reverse the invasive phenotype as well as attenuate the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.33 In this study, we generated two vectors: pS/MAR-Luc, responsible for the expression of the reporter gene luciferase, and pS/MAR SMAD4-Luc, where the expression of the tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 was linked to luciferase through the P2A self-cleavage sequence. These vectors were used to engineer the commonly used pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 genetically. We first investigated the capacity of the vectors to generate stable cell lines and to restore the expression of SMAD4 in\u00a0vitro before these cells were used for the generation of orthotropic xenograft mouse models. We showed not only that we could restore the expression of a key tumor suppressor gene in\u00a0vitro, but also that the engineered cells retained a stable expression of the transgene in\u00a0vivo. The histopathological analysis of Capan-1 luciferase tumors showed that the modification of the cells with this vector technology had a minimal impact on the cells\u2019 behavior, as they formed tumors that displayed a highly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma morphology similarly to tumors formed from the unmodified parental Capan-1 cell line. The metastasis in the liver and in the lungs of mice injected with parental Capan-1 and Capan-1 luciferase cells also confirmed that the presence of the vector did not molecularly alter the cells\u2019 behavior, and they retained their aggressive metastatic potential. In contrast, Capan-1 SMAD4-Luc cells formed tumors in the pancreas that appeared smaller with a lost capability of forming metastasis. Although the presence of the episomal vector did not influence the growth of the cells, the transcriptome analysis of Capan-1 luciferase cells revealed that at the molecular level the presence and the extrachromosomal replication of plasmids carrying bacterial sequences were responsible for the perturbation of about 400 genes that are mostly associated with antiviral and inflammation responses. These findings are in accordance with previous reports, where it was demonstrated that the presence of bacterial sequences in plasmids is responsible for the cell responses against foreign DNA that leads to its epigenetic silencing. As expected, the transcriptome analysis did not show upregulation for the transcripts responsible for the expression of the SMAD4 protein, as the microarray probes do not match the codon-optimized transgenic sequence (Figure\u00a0S6). To improve the efficacy of our DNA vector technology and to test the potential toxicity of extraneous bacterial sequences, we decided to swap the bacterial backbone composed of a pUC origin of replication and the selectable selection kanamycin for the RNA-OUT system developed at Nature Technology Corporation (NTC). We called this novel class of minimally sized antibiotic-free vector DNA plasmids nano-S/MAR (nS/MAR). This new generation of DNA vectors was compared to the respective traditional plasmids in HEK293T cells, and we could show that the nS/MAR vectors had a higher establishment of efficacy and that they sustained more robust transgene expression in the established clones over time for a minimum of 35\u00a0days. In accordance with what was previously reported by Argyros et\u00a0al.,3 cells that are modified with a plasmid carrying minimal bacterial sequences are characterized by a higher transgene expression, most likely due to a significant reduction in the CpG content. Also, in this novel class of vectors, the presence of the S/MAR sequence mediated the extrachromosomal replication, as we could demonstrate by Southern blot. We further challenged this vector technology in human primary pancreatic cells (PACO2). PACO2 cells were demonstrated to have a high constant secretion of the antiviral cytokine interferon-\u03b2,34 which makes them challenging to transfect with a canonical plasmid. The benefits of having a minimally sized bacterial backbone were evident in PACO2 cells where nS/MAR vectors could be more effectively delivered to cells. Furthermore, for the first time, we showed that the nS/MAR vectors could successfully be established in primary cells ex\u00a0vivo and that the portion of unmodified cells was substantially reduced. As PACO2 cells carry a mutation in the SMAD4 locus, we could demonstrate the successful establishment of cell lines where we rescued the functionality of the tumor suppressor gene with nS/MAR vectors. At the molecular level, we investigated the impact of nS/MAR vectors on PACO2 cells by measuring their genome-wide RNA expression levels. PACO2-GFP cells surprisingly showed that although they had undergone the selection process and they were grown for 30\u00a0days with the episomal vectors, only two genes were perturbed by the process with changes in their expression profiles. This result shows the minimal impact of the vector system in primary cells during the engineering process. In high contrast, the PACO2 cells in which the expression of SMAD4 was rescued showed more profound changes, particularly in genes that were previously reported to be associated with SMAD4 functionality such as the transcriptional regulation of MMP1.35 The enrichment in the signature associated with TGF-\u03b2 activation and EMT demonstrated the activity of the tumor suppressor gene and, indirectly, that the nS/MAR technology can provide the sustained expression of functional SMAD4 throughout hundreds of cell divisions. The parental and GFP PACO2 cells engrafted in mice with equivalent efficiency, forming indistinguishable tumors that grew out from the pancreas and into the abdominal cavity. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that the genetic modification of these cells with an nS/MAR-GFP had no impact on the behavior of the cells. They formed tumors that displayed the same aggressive phenotype characterized by ductal structures and active proliferation as demonstrated with the Ki67 staining. In contrast, the restoration of SMAD4 induced profound changes. The injected cells did not develop tumors in most mice, and in these cases where an outgrown tumor was found, it did not show the expression of the tumor suppressor, indicating that it arose from escaper cells. Before injection of PACO2 SMAD4-GFP cells, FACS analysis revealed that \u223c97% of the cells were positive for the expression of the transgenic construct, and it is likely that the negative fraction of modified cell populations induced the tumor engraftment in a few mice.",
                "In this study, we conclude that although the originally described pS/MAR vectors can, in principle, be used to genetically modify most cell types, the presence of their large bacterial backbone represents a limitation in the application of this vector technology to primary cells that are known to respond against foreign DNA sequences. Herein, we show the generation of the nS/MAR nanovector platform, and we demonstrate its enhanced efficiency at modifying and generating novel cell lines that are characterized by higher transgene expression and lower vector-mediated molecular perturbation. We think that the novel nS/MAR DNA vector system will prove to be a valuable genetic tool useful for the generation of persistently modified isogenic cells, providing the utility to evaluate the expression of transgenes with minimal vector-mediated impact in cultured cell lines or typically refractory primary and patient-derived cells."
