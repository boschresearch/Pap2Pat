    "abstract": "Herein disclosed is an alternatively-spliced [AS] variant of MN/CA9 mRNA and its related protein\u2014AS MN/CA IX. Unlike the tumor-associated, full-length [FL] MN/CA9 mRNA and FL MN/CA IX, which in most tissues signify oncogenesis and/or hypoxia, the AS MN/CA9 mRNA is constitutively-expressed under normoxia and is not stimulated by hypoxia, and the AS MN/CA IX is not confined to the cell membrane. Provided herein are diagnostic/prognostic methods for preneoplastic/neoplastic disease to differentiate between AS and FL MN/CA9 expression, and probes, primers, and antibodies useful in such methods. Also disclosed are methods to treat pre-neoplastic/neoplastic disease involving the MN gene and protein, which methods are based on the ability of AS MN protein (AS MN/CA IX) to interfere with the catalytic activity of FL MN protein (FL MN/CA IX); such methods may also use AS MN protein fragments that have that interference capability. Such methods may comprise increasing the levels of AS MN/CA IX relative to the levels of FL MN/CA IX. Exemplary therapeutic methods may comprise the administration of agents, such as, AS MN/CA IX itself, a vector expressing AS MN/CA9 mRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide that blocks expression of FL MN/CA IX but not that of AS MN/CA IX, a vector expressing such an antisense oligonucleotide, a FL MN/CA9 isoform-specific siRNA, or a vector expressing such FL MN/CA9 isoform-specific siRNA. Further disclosed are methods to identify agents capable of modulating levels of AS MN/CA IX.",

The AS MN/CA9 mRNA is primarily expressed in normal cells and under normoxia, and can interfere with assays measuring the expression of full-length [FL] MN/CA9 mRNA, particularly in RT-PCR assays. This invention is also directed to the AS form of MN/CA IX, and diagnostic/prognostic methods using assays to detect or to detect and quantify it, alone or in combination with the FL form of MN/CA IX protein. Further, this invention concerns therapeutic methods exploiting MN/CA9 alternative splicing as a means to target FL MN/CA IX protein. The forms of AS MN/CA9/CA IX that are the focus of this invention can be vertebrate, but preferably mammalian, and more preferably human."

The MN protein was found to bind zinc and have carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity and is now considered to be the ninth carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme\u2014MN/CA IX or CA IX [Opavsky et al. (1996), infra]. According to the carbonic anhydrase nomenclature, human CA isoenzymes are written in capital roman letters and numbers, while their genes are written in italic letters and arabic numbers. Alternatively, \u201cMN\u201d is used herein to refer either to carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme IX (CA IX) proteins/polypeptides, or carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme 9 (CA9) gene, nucleic acids, cDNA, mRNA etc. as indicated by the context.",
                        "The MN protein has also been identified with the G250 antigen.

                        "CA IX is a cancer-related carbonic anhydrase identified by Zavada, J., Pastorekova, S. and Pastorek, J. [\u201cZavada et al.,\u201d see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,676] using the M75 monoclonal antibody first described by Pastorekova et al. [Virology 187: 620-626 (1992)]. That antibody was employed in cloning of cDNA encoding CA IX [Pastorek et al., Oncogene, 9: 2788-2888 (1994)], in the assessment of CA IX expression in tumors and normal tissues [Zavada et al., Int J Cancer. 54: 268-274, (1993), and many other references], in the study of CA IX regulation by cell density [Lieskovska et al., Neoplasma. 46: 17-24, (1999), Kaluz et al., Cancer Research, 62: 4469-4477, (2002)] as well in demonstration of CA IX induction by hypoxia [Wykoff et al., Cancer Research, 60: 7075-7083 (2000), and many other references]. All such studies supported Zavada et al's original conception and work [for example, Zavada et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,676] that MN/CA IX/CA9 can be used diagnostically and/or prognostically as a preneoplastic/neoplastic tumor marker and therapeutically as a target, and showed that the M75 monoclonal antibody is a valuable CA IX-specific reagent useful for different immunodetection methods and immunotargeting approaches.",

No. 5,387,676 (issued Feb. 7, 1995), describe the discovery and biological and molecular nature of the MN gene and protein. The MN gene was found to be present in the chromosomal DNA of all vertebrates tested, and its expression to be strongly correlated with tumorigenicity.",
                        "The MN protein was first identified in HeLa cells, derived from a human carcinoma of cervix uteri. It is found in many types of human carcinomas (notably uterine cervical, ovarian, endometrial, renal, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and prostate, among others). Very few normal tissues have been found to express MN protein to any significant degree. Those MN-expressing normal tissues include the human gastric mucosa and gallbladder epithelium, and some other normal tissues of the alimentary tract. Paradoxically, MN gene expression has been found to be lost or reduced in carcinomas and other preneoplastic/neoplastic diseases in some tissues that normally express MN, e.g., gastric mucosa.",
                        "In general, oncogenesis may be signified by the abnormal expression of MN protein. For example, oncogenesis may be signified: (1) when MN protein is present in a tissue which normally does not express MN protein to any significant degree; (2) when MN protein is absent from a tissue that normally expresses it; (3) when MN gene expression is at a significantly increased level, or at a significantly reduced level from that normally expressed in a tissue; or (4) when MN protein is expressed in an abnormal location within a cell.",

Methods and compositions were provided therein for identifying the onset and presence of neoplastic disease by detecting or detecting and quantitating abnormal MN gene expression in vertebrates. Abnormal MN gene expression can be detected or detected and quantitated by a variety of conventional assays in vertebrate samples, for example, by immunoassays using MN-specific antibodies to detect or detect and quantitate MN antigen, by hybridization assays or by PCR assays, such as RT-PCR, using MN nucleic acids, such as, MN cDNA, to detect or detect and quantitate MN nucleic acids, such as, MN mRNA.",

                        "CA IX is a highly active member of a carbonic anhydrase family of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible conversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate [Pastorek et al. (1994); Opavsky et al. (1996); Chegwidden et al., (2000), infra; Wingo et al, (2001), infra; Pastorekova et al. (2004), infra]. It is one of 14 isoforms that exist in mammals and occupy different subcellular positions, including cytoplasm (CA I, II, III, VII), mitochondrion (CA VA, VB), secretory vesicles (CA VI) and plasma membrane (CA IV, IX, XIl, XIV). Some of the isozymes are distributed over broad range of tissues (CA I, II, CA IV), others are more restricted to particular organs (CA VI in salivary glands) and two isoforms have been linked to cancer tissues (CA IX, XII) [reviewed in Chegwidden (2000); Pastorekova and Pastorek, Chapter 9, Carbonic Anhydrase: Its Inhibitors and Activators (eds. Supuran et al.; CRC Press (London et al.) 2004]. Enzyme activity and kinetic properties, as well as sensitivity to sulfonamide inhibitors vary from high (CA II, CA IX, CA XII, CA IV) to low (CA III) [Supuran and Scozzafava (2000), infra]. Several isoforms designated as CA-related proteins (CA-RP VIII, X, XI) are acatalytic due to incompletely conserved active site. This extraordinary variability among the genetically related members of the same family of proteins creates a basis for their employment in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The catalytic activity is of fundamental relevance for the maintenance of acid-base balance and exchange of ions and water in metabolically active tissues. Via this activity, CAs substantially contribute to respiration, production of body fluids (vitreous humor, gastric juice, cerebrospinal fluid), bone resorption, renal acidification etc. (Chegwidden et al. 2000).",
                        "CA IX isozyme integrates several properties that make it an important subject of basic as well as clinical research. First of all, expression of CA IX is very tightly associated with a broad variety of human tumors, while it is generally absent from the corresponding normal tissues [Zavada et al. (1993); Liao et al. (1994), infra; Turner et al. 1997, infra; Liao et al. 1997, infra; Saarnio et al., 1998, infra; Vermylen et al., 1999, infra; Ivanov et al. (2001), infra; Bartosova et al. (2002), infra]. This is principally related to tumor hypoxia that strongly activates transcription of the CA9 gene via a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which binds to a hypoxia responsive element (HRE) localized in the minimal CA9 promoter proximal to transcription start site at the \u221210/\u22123 position [Wykoff et al. (2000), infra]. The HIF transcription factor significantly changes the expression profile of weakly oxygenated tumor cells by activation of genes that either support their survival and adaptation to hypoxic stress or lead to their death. As a result, hypoxia selects for more aggressive tumor cells with increased capability to invade and metastasize and is therefore inherently associated with bad prognosis and poor response to anticancer therapy [Harris (2002), infra].",
                        "Since tumor hypoxia is an important phenomenon with dramatic implications for cancer development and therapy [Hockel and Vaupel (2001), infra], MN bears a significant potential as an intrinsic hypoxic marker with a prognostic/predictive value and as a promising therapeutic target [Wykoff et al. (2000); Wykoff et al. (2001), infra; Beasley et al. (2001), infra; Giatromanolaki et al. (2001), infra; Koukourakis et al. (2001), infra; Potter and Harris (2003), infra]. In favor of the proposed clinical applications, CA IX is an integral plasma membrane protein with a large extracellular part exposed at the surface of cancer cells and is thus accessible by the targeting tools, including the specific monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, CA IX differs from the other CA isozymes by the presence of a unique proteoglycan-related region (PG) that forms an N-terminal extension of the extracellular CA domain and allows for elimination of cross-recognition with other isozymes [Opavsky et al. (1996)]. CA IX appears to play an active role in tumor biology both via modulation of cell adhesion and control of pH (Svastova et al, 2003, infra, Svastova et al, 2004, infra, Swietach et al, 2007, infra). CA IX participates in bicarbonate transport metabolon and contributes to acidification of extracellular microenvironment in response to hypoxia (Morgan et al, 2007, infra, Svastova et al, 2004, infra). In addition, CA IX's intracellular domain (IC) has a potential third tumorigenic role, at least in renal cell carcinoma: tyrosine-phosphorylated CA IX (mediated via EGFR) interacts with the regulatory subunit of PI-3K (p85), resulting in activation of Akt [Dorai et al. (2005), infra]. Because of its many potential activities contributing to oncogenesis, targeting the CA IX protein for abrogation of its function is expected to have therapeutic effects. However, many basic molecular and functional aspects of CA IX have been unknown; one of which had been CA IX's potential alternative splicing.",
                        "Alternative splicing is an important molecular mechanism that contributes to structural and functional diversification of proteins. It frequently results from differential exon inclusion and leads to altered domain composition, subcellular localization, interaction potential, signalling capacity and other changes at the protein level. Data obtained by recent genomic technologies indicate that over 60% of human genes are alternatively spliced. It is also becoming increasingly evident that imbalances in expression of alternative splicing variants can significantly affect cell phenotype and play a role in various pathologies (Matlin et al, 2005, infra).",
                        "The instant invention is based upon the discovery that CA9 gene expression involves alternative splicing. Herein are described alternatively spliced (AS) mouse and human variants of MN mRNA. The inventors demonstrate that the human AS variant is less abundant than the full-length (FL) CA9 mRNA in tumors, but can be detected in normal tissues and under normoxia. The human AS CA9 mRNA does not contain exons 8 and 9 and codes for a truncated CA IX protein. Consequently, the AS CA IX is not confined to plasma membrane and shows reduced catalytic activity. Upon overexpression in HeLa cells, the AS CA IX reduces hypoxia-induced extracellular acidification and compromises growth of HeLa spheroids. Because the AS variant can be present in normoxic cells with a normal phenotype, it can produce false-positive results in diagnostic and/or prognostic studies designed to assess hypoxia- and tumor-related expression of CA9 gene. Moreover, the AS form of CA IX protein may functionally interfere with the FL CA IX form, especially under moderate hypoxia, when the FL levels are relatively low."

A further discovery, upon which therapeutic aspects of the invention are based, is that AS CA IX interferes with the function of the FL CA IX. The hypoxia- and tumor-independent production of the AS variant of CA IX has many implications for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of CA IX.",

The diagnostic/prognostic methods of the invention in one aspect exploit the differences between the alternatively spliced MN/CA9 nucleic acids and the full length MN/CA9 nucleic acids, for example, by targeting probes to a splice junction present in AS MN/CA9 mRNA but not in FL MN/CA9 mRNA, or to a nucleic acid sequence absent in AS MN/CA9 mRNA but present in FL MN/CA9 mRNA. Analogously, primer pairs can be designed, for example, to amplify regions found only in AS MN/CA9 mRNA and not in FL MN/CA9 mRNA or vice versa. Ones of skill in the art in view of the instant disclosure would be able to design any number of probes and/or primers/primer pairs that would be useful in the diagnostic/prognostic methods of this invention.",

                        "The MN/CA IX protein is functionally implicated in tumorigenesis as part of the regulatory mechanisms that control pH and cell adhesion. MN/CA IX is induced primarily under hypoxia via the HIF-1 pathway; HIF-1 may also be expressed under normoxia by different extracellular signals and oncogenic changes, such as high cell density, transmitted via the PI3K pathway, which can result in increased MN/CA IX expression. Both the HIF-1 and PI3K pathways increase HIF-1 protein levels, which increases can be translated into increased MN/CA IX levels.",
                        "The inventors found, as shown in the Examples below, that in addition to full-length (FL) CA9 transcript encoding a hypoxia-induced CA IX protein with high enzyme activity and capacity to regulate pH, there is also a less abundant, constitutively-produced, alternatively-spliced (AS) CA9 transcript. As demonstrated in Example 2 below, the alternative splicing variant of the human CA9 mRNA does not contain exons 8 and 9 and is expressed in tumor cells independently of hypoxia. It is also detectable in normal tissues in the absence of the full-length transcript and can therefore produce false-positive data in prognostic studies based on detection of the hypoxia- and cancer-related CA9 expression. The splicing variant encodes a truncated CA IX protein lacking the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain, shows diminished catalytic activity, and is either localized intracellularly or secreted. When overexpressed, it reduces the capacity of the full-length CA IX protein to acidify extracellular pH of hypoxic cells and to bind carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Examples 4 and 5 describe experiments showing that the human AS CA IX variant is not confined to plasma membrane and upon overexpression interferes with the function of the FL protein. In Example 5, HeLa cells transfected with the splicing variant cDNA generate spheroids that do not form compact cores, suggesting that they fail to adapt to hypoxic stress. This AS capability may be relevant particularly under conditions of mild hypoxia, when the cells do not suffer from severe acidosis and do not need excessive pH control.",
                        "The hypoxia- and tumor- independent production of the AS variant of CA IX has many implications for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of CA IX. Future diagnostic/prognostic studies of the full-length CA9 mRNA (encoding the functional CA IX protein) can design probes/primers designed to avoid simultaneous detection of an alternatively spliced variant, and cancer therapies can be based on CA9 alternative splicing, e.g., by design of oligonucleotides used for antisense and RNA interference therapies, among other therapies."

As used herein, \u201chypoxia\u201d is defined as an oxygen tension level necessary to stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 in a specific tissue or cell. Experimentally-induced hypoxia is generally in the range of 2% pO2 or below, but above anoxia (0% pO2, as anoxia would be lethal). The examples described herein that concern hypoxia were performed at 2% pO2 which is an exemplary hypoxic condition. However, ones of skill in the art would expect other oxygen tension levels to be understood as \u201chypoxic\u201d and to produce similar experimental results. For example, Wykoff et al. [Cancer Research. 60: 7075-7083 (2000)] used a condition of 0.1% pO2 as representative of hypoxia to induce HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of CA9. Tomes et al. has demonstrated varying degrees of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and CA9 expression in HeLa cells or primary human breast fibroblasts under exemplary in vitro hypoxic conditions of 0.3%, 0.5% and 2.5% pO2 [Tomes et al., Br. Cancer Res. Treat. 81(1):61-69 (2003)]. Alternatively, Kaluz et al. has used the exemplary hypoxic condition of 0.5% pO2 for experimental induction of CA9 [Kaluz et al., Cancer Res., 63: 917-922 (2003)] and referred to \u201cexperimentally-induced ranges\u201d of hypoxia as 0.1-1% pO2 [Cancer Res., 62: 44694477 (2002)].",

One of skill in the art would be able to determine whether a condition is hypoxic as defined herein, based on a determination of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Exemplary ranges of hypoxia in a specific tissue or cell may be, for example, between about 3% to about 0.05% pO2, between about 2% to about 0.1% pO2, between about 1% to about 0.1% pO2, and between about 0.5% to about 0.1% pO2."

As expected on the basis of the distribution in human and rat tissues, the highest level of Car9 mRNA was detected in the mouse stomach. Medium level of Car9 mRNA was found in the small intestine and colon, while the kidney and brain showed very weak expression. The liver and spleen were negative. Noteworthy, the RNP signal was also present in the mouse embryo at the age of embryonic day E18.5, but not in embryonic stem cells and in the E10.5 embryo.

Many recent articles provide general information regarding alternative splicing in cancer, and specific information regarding the design of specific probes and/or primers used to detect mRNA variants expressed by cancer-related genes, from which probes and/or primers could be designed to detect AS and/or FL CA9 mRNA variants [See, for example, Matlin et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 6: 386-398 (2005); Venables J P, BioEssays, 28: 378-386 (2006); Skotheim and Nees, Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 39(7-8): 1432-1449 (2007); Srebrow and Komnblihit, J Cell Sci., 119(Pt 13): 2635-2641 (2006); Gothie et al., J Biol Chem. 275: 6922-6927 (2000); Robinson et al., J Cell Sci., 114: 853-865 (2001); He et al., Oncogene, 25: 2192-2202 (2006); Roy et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 33(16): 5026-5033 (2005); Taconelli et al., Cancer Cell, 6: 347-360 (2004)]. In one method, at least one probe or primer used to detect only FL CA9 mRNA would be derived wholly or in part from inside a region deleted in AS CA9 mRNA, whereas at least one probe or primer used to detect only AS CA9 mRNA would be derived from the alternative splicing-generated junction. For example, a human FL MN/CA9-specific probe/primer could comprise a nucleic acid which binds with adequate specificity, preferably specifically, to exon 8 or exon 9 of the human MN/CA9 gene, or binds with adequate specificity, preferably specifically, to the splice junction of exons 7 and 8, the splice junction of exons 8 and 9, or the splice junction of exons 9 and 10 of the human MN/CA9 gene; or could comprise any nucleic acid sufficiently homologous to bind with adequate specificity, preferably specifically to any of those sequences. Similarly, a human AS MN/CA9-specific probe/primer could comprise a nucleic acid which binds with adequate specificity, preferably specifically, to the splice junction of exons 7 and 10 of the human MN/CA9 gene; or could comprise any nucleic acid sufficiently homologous to bind with adequate specificity, preferably specifically, to that splice junction. Alternatively, probes and/or primers could be used to detect both FL and AS CA9 mRNA, and the FL and AS mRNA products differentiated by their length, e.g., on a gel."

The forward primer was designed to the start of exon 9 (m9S, 5\u2032-TCCATGTGMTTCCTGCTTCACTG-3\u2032) [SEQ ID NO: 102] and the reverse primer was specific to the end of exon 6 (m6A, 5\u2032-CTTCCTCCGAGATTTCTTCCAAAT-3\u2032) [SEQ ID NO: 103]. Similarly, the eukaryotic expression plasmid pSG5C-AS encoding the human splicing variant was generated by inverse PCR from the pSG5C-MN/CA9 expression plasmid (Pastorek et al, 1994) that contains a full-length human CA9 cDNA (GenBank # X66839) using the primers to exons 10 and 7. The forward primer (h10S, 5\u2032-GTGACATCCTAGCCCTGGTTTTT-3\u2032) [SEQ ID NO: 104] was specific to the start of exon 10 and the reverse primer (h7A, 5\u2032-CTGCTTAGCACTCAGCATCA CTG-3\u2032) [SEQ ID NO: 105] was specific to the end of exon 7. The same h7A and h10S primers were used for the preparation of a bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X-AS encoding a GST-fused splice variant of the human CA IX protein, from the primary plasmid construct pGEX-3X-CA9 coding for the full-length CA IX protein without the signal peptide. PCR amplifications were performed using a Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). PCR reactions consisted of an initial denaturing at 98\u00b0 C. for 30 s, 32 cycles of denaturing at 98\u00b0 C. for 10 s, annealing at 64\u00b0 C. for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min 40 s, and final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0 C. PCR products were gel purified, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). All constructs were verified by sequencing. The construct coding for GST-PGCA fusion protein containing the extracellular part of the human CA IX was described earlier (Zatovicova et al, 2003).

This mouse AS variant was found in all three analyzed tissues\u2014the stomach, small intestine and colon (FIG. 1B).

The human AS cDNA was transfected into CA IX-negative MDCK cells as well as to human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells that naturally express FL CA IX in response to density and hypoxia. In accord with the computer analysis that predicted splicing- and frameshift-mediated removal of TM and IC regions, the AS CA IX protein was not confined to the plasma membrane, but showed intracellular localization in both MDCK cells and in normoxic HeLa cells (FIG. 5A). This was clearly contrasting with the cell surface localization of the FL CA IX in the transfected MDCK cells and in the mock-transfected HeLa cells exposed to hypoxia (2% O2).",

Because of the complete absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains from the AS protein the inventors also assumed that at least a portion of the AS CA IX molecules should be released into the culture medium. To investigate this possibility, the cells were cultivated under normoxia and hypoxia in the serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, one fourth of the culture medium was concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting showed the presence of AS CA IX in the culture medium under both normoxia and hypoxia (FIG. 5B). Taken together, these data indicated that the AS is present in the intracellular as well as extracellular space, in contrast to FL CA IX, which is mostly confined to plasma membrane.",

This assumption has been tested using the monoclonal antibody V/10, which normally binds to the intact domain of CA IX, but cannot recognize the AS variant (data not shown). This V/10 Mab was utilized for immunoprecipitation of the CA IX oligomers via its interaction with FL molecules. Components of the oligomers (including potentially incorporated AS molecules) were then resolved in reducing PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting using the peroxidase-labeled M75 antibody that reacts with both FL and AS forms. Under non-reducing conditions, the FL protein formed oligomers of about 153 K, whereas the AS CA IX variant was unable to do so and was also unable to enter into oligomers built by FL CA IX protein (FIG. 6; for details see Materials and Methods)."

                                "Expression of the FL CA IX in tumor cells is induced by hypoxia. Hypoxia also activates the catalytic performance of CA IX, which results in enhanced acidification of extracellular pH (Svastova et al, 2004). This acidification capacity can be abolished by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant lacking the catalytic CA domain of CA IX (Svastova et al, 2004). Since the AS protein contains only incomplete CA domain, it was particularly important to analyze whether it is catalytically active and whether it is capable to disturb acidification mediated by the FL CA IX protein. Measurement of an enzyme activity was accomplished by stopped flow spectrometry using the recombinant bacterial GST-AS fusion protein containing the truncated CA domain compared to a GST-fused extracellular portion of the FL CA IX containing the complete CA domain [eg., SEQ ID NO: 9] and thereby forming GST-PGCA which contains both the PG and CA domains [aa 52-397 (SEQ ID NO: 83)]. The results revealed that the catalytic activity of the wild-type CA IX, Kcat(WT)=3.8\u00d7105 s\u22121, was reduced to a half in the splicing variant, Kcat(AS)=1.9\u00d7105 s\u22121. In addition, GST-AS protein showed considerably lower affinity for acetazolamine, a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases: Ki WT=14 nM versus Ki AS=110 nM. Those data suggest that the splicing has compromised both, the enzyme activity of CA IX and its affinity to inhibitors.",
                                "The inventors also wanted to learn whether the AS CA IX can modulate the capacity of the FL CA IX to acidify extracellular pH under hypoxic conditions. For that purpose the inventors analyzed the transfected HeLa-AS cells and the mock-transfected controls incubated for 48 h in 2% O2 (hypoxia) and 21% O2 (normoxia). Hypoxic incubation led to expected extracellular acidification in the control as well as in AS-transfected HeLa cells when compared to their normoxic counterparts (FIG. 7A). However, the medium was approximately 0.2 pH unit less acidified in the AS-overexpressing cells suggesting that the AS disturbed the activity of the wild-type CA IX protein.",
                                "Since the catalytic site of CA IX is exposed to extracellular space, the inventors tested a possible role of the extracellular fraction of AS. As described earlier, the activity of CA IX can be indirectly demonstrated using the fluorescein-labelled CA inhibitor (FITC-CAI) that binds only to hypoxia-activated CA IX whose catalytic site is accessible by the inhibitor (Svastova et al, 2004). Therefore, the inventors used an established model of CA IX-transfected MDCK cells that show CA IX-mediated extracellular acidification when treated by hypoxia and accumulate FITC-CAI in hypoxia but not in normoxia. Here the inventors analyzed the accumulation of FITC-CAI in MDCK-CA IX cells in the presence and absence of culture medium from the AS-secreting MDCK-AS transfectants. As shown on FIG. 7B, incubation of MDCK-CA IX cells in the fresh medium mixed with the AS-containing conditioned medium resulted in visibly reduced accumulation of FITC-CA IX supporting the idea that the extracellular AS diminished the binding of the inhibitor. This experiment has been repeated with one half as well as one third of the AS-containing conditioned medium. The acquired images were analyzed to determine the differences in intensity of fluorescence. The results clearly proved that the extracellular fraction of AS reduced FITC-CAI accumulation approximately to a half (FIG. 7C).",
                                "To see whether the effect of the AS variant on the functioning of the FL CA IX could have biological consequences, the inventors analyzed the growth parameters of the HeLa-AS transfectants compared to the mock-transfected controls. No significant differences were observed between these two cell types upon their short-term (72 h) growth in adherent culture independently of normoxic or hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Therefore, the inventors also produced HeLa cell spheroids grown for 14 days and compared the mass and shape of the spheroids generated from the HeLa-AS cells and the control HeLa cells, respectively. The HeLa-AS spheroids were less compact and lacked the central region, which usually contains the cells that suffer from low oxygen and acidic pH (FIG. 7D). The appearance of these HeLa-AS spheroids suggested that the effect of AS, which leads to reduced capacity of the FL CA IX to modulate pH, could influence the capability of cells to survive these microenvironmental stresses.",

                                "Deregulation of alternative splicing is a well-recognized phenomenon particularly in cancer (Venables et al, 2006). There are numerous examples of alternatively spliced genes whose products are causally involved in tumor progression, such as CD44, HIF-\u03b1, VEGF, osteopontin and many others (Wong et al, 2003, Gothie et al, 2000, Robinson et al, 2001, He et al, 2006). In some cases, the splice form that is rare in normal tissues can become common in tumors, while the alternative splice form present in normal tissues can remain constant (Roy et al, 2005).",
                                "Alternative splicing variant of the human CA IX identified in this study can be classified to this category, although it is difficult to make a clear-cut conclusion, since the expression pattern of the full-length CA IX is quite particular. The FL CA IX is abundant in very few normal tissues including the stomach and small intestine, which at the same time express low level of the alternative splicing variant. In gastric carcinomas, expression of the FL CA IX decreases, but the level of AS is similar as in the normal stomach. On the other hand, expression of the full-length CA IX is absent or very low in the normal colon and rectum (and also in additional normal tissues not analyzed in this study) and significantly increases in corresponding tumors (Saarnio et al, 1998). However, the AS variant shows a steady expression level in both normal tissues and colorectal carcinomas. These data strongly suggest that its expression is not linked to tumor phenotype. Moreover, in contrast to the FL CA IX whose levels are induced in the cells growing in crowded culture and exposed to low oxygen, the AS variant is not principally dependent on hypoxia and cell density.",
                                "Relatively low, but constitutive expression of AS is of considerable importance for clinical studies using CA9 transcription as a marker of hypoxic tumors for potential prognostic or predictive purposes. Because of the presence of AS in the absence of FL CA9 transcript in the normal and/or non-hypoxic tissues, primers or probes designed for detection of the regions that are not affected by the splicing cannot differentiate between the two forms of CA9 mRNA and thus might give false-positive results, which could influence the real clinical value of the hypoxia-induced FL CA9.",
                                "Noteworthy, 5\u2032 RACE analysis of the AS mRNA compared to the FL transcript has generated the products of identical length supporting the conclusion that both variants are produced from the same promoter (data not shown). This fact might suggest a differential cooperation of the transcriptional apparatus with the components of the splicing machinery in the processing of the CA9 transcript depending on the physiological circumstances. Indeed, there are several examples of the splicing events regulated by hypoxia such as those related to hTERT, TrkA and XBP1 (Anderson et al, 2006, Taconelli et al, 2004, Romero-Ramirez et al, 2004). In the case of hTERT it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional complex containing RNA polymerase 11, TFIIB, HIF and co activators recruits at the promoter under hypoxia and remains associated with the gene as long as transcription proceeds. This induces switch in the splice pattern in favour of an active form of the enzyme (Anderson et al, 2006). It is quite conceivable that a similar mechanism might operate during the transcription of the CA9 gene.",
                                "The AS variant of the human CA9 mRNA results from deletion of exons 8 plus 9 and is translated to truncated protein which does not contain the transmembrane region, intracellular tail and C-terminal part of the catalytic domain. Removal of the TM and IC regions is apparently responsible for the altered localization of this AS variant, which predominantly occupies intracellular space and is also released to extracellular medium. This is contrasting with the FL CA IX protein, which is an integral plasma membrane protein. Such inappropriate localization linked with a partial deletion of the catalytic domain can be expected to compromise the protein functionality. Indeed, GST-AS shows only half of the enzyme activity of the corresponding GST-PG+CA protein containing the complete catalytic domain. However, it is very difficult to translate this finding directly into local cellular context, where CA IX interacts with bicarbonate transporters and contributes to pH regulation across the plasma membrane under hypoxic conditions (Morgan et al, 2007, Svastova et al, 2004, Swietach et al, 2007). Firstly, the activity measurements were performed with the proteins produced in bacteria in a setting free of any subcellular structures, protein-protein interactions, ion fluxes and microenvironmental influences which certainly play a role in modulating the catalytic performance of CA IX. Secondly, the catalytic activities of different carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes vary roughly within two orders of magnitude, with the highly active isoforms showing from 20- to only 3-times higher activity than the isoenzymes that are considered moderate (Pastorekova et al, 2004). So it is not possible to preclude whether the half-reduced activity would be sufficient for the physiological function of CA IX. Anyhow, this question is probably not critical, since the AS variant is not properly localized at the plasma membrane and is unable to form oligomers, which are very important constraints for the CA IX protein functioning.",
                                "However, reduced extracellular acidification observed in the culture of hypoxic HeLa-AS cells that constitutively overexpress the AS form of CA IX clearly indicates that it interferes with the function of endogenous, hypoxia-induced FL protein. Although the mechanism is not clear at present, based on the decreased accumulation of CA inhibitor in the hypoxic MDCK-CA IX cells treated with the AS variant, one can propose that AS competes with the FL CA IX for an interaction with the cell surface components of the bicarbonate transport metabolon. Moreover, overexpression of AS considerably affects the capacity of HeLa cells to form compact spheroids, which are often used as a 3D model that mimics tumor mass with corresponding intratumoral microenvironment. Many studies well document gradients of oxygen partial pressure, pH, nutrients and metabolites across the spheroids whose core regions show clear analogy with the hypoxic areas of solid tumors that are characterized by more acidic microenvironment (Alvarez-Perez et al, 2005). It has been shown elsewhere that the plasma membrane staining of the FL CA IX is significantly increased in the innermost cells of multicellular spheroids generated from SiHa and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells (Olive et al, 2001, Chrastina et al, 2003). These data indicate that FL CA IX is present exactly in the areas where the cells need increased protection and/or adaptation to harmful effects of the hypoxic stress and acidic microenvironment in order to survive. The FL CA IX acts here via bicarbonate-mediated buffering of intracellular pH (Swietach et al, 2007). The AS variant that partially perturbs this pH regulation, obviously does not permit the adaptation to acidic intra-spheroid pH, leading to elimination of the most stressed central cells from the core of spheroids. This idea is consistent with the findings that the catalytic activity of CA IX is regulated by hypoxia and suggests that the capacity of CA IX to modulate pH is vital for the survival of hypoxic tumor cells. The latter suggestion has been indirectly supported also by RNAi experiments by Robertson et al (2004).",
                                "Although the naturally produced AS variant is expressed at low level, there are physiological situations and cell types that only weakly induce FL CA IX. For example tumor cells localized at shorter distances from functional blood-supplying vessels are exposed to mild hypoxia and may express comparable levels of FL and AS allowing thus for dominant-negative down-modulation of CA IX activity. Such weakly hypoxic cells are presumably not exposed to severe acidosis and therefore may not benefit from full performance of this pH-control mechanism. Similar explanation can be applied also to normal tissues suffering from mild ischemia. This idea finds support in the recent as well as previous data showing that some tumor cell lines, dense normoxic cells (affected by weak pericellular hypoxia) and some early stage less-hypoxic tumors express just low levels of FL CA IX. In conclusion, the inventors propose that the AS variant functions as a modulator of the FL CA IX under circumstances when both proteins are co-expressed. The low but constitutive expression of the alternative splicing variant is of considerable importance for clinical studies based on CA9 transcription as a marker of hypoxic tumors for potential prognostic or predictive purposes. Because of the presence of AS in the absence of FL CA9 transcript in normal and/or non-hypoxic tissues, primers or probes designed for detection of the regions that are not affected by the splicing cannot differentiate between the two forms of CA9 mRNA and thus might give false-positive results, which could influence the real clinical value of hypoxia-induced FL CA9. This could, in fact, happen in several studies that have been published so far [e.g. McKiernan et al., Cancer, 86(3): 492497 (1999); Span et al., Br J Cancer, 89(2): 271-276 (2003); Simi et al., Lung Cancer, 52(1): 59-66 (2006); Greiner et al., Blood. 108(13): 4109-4117 (2006)]. For this reason, design of correct primers and probes for microarray chips and RT-PCR should be made with precaution and should take into account the AS form of MN/CA IX."

        "51. An oligonucleotide that increases levels of alternatively-spliced [AS] MN/CA IX relative to levels of full-length [FL] MN/CA IX, wherein said oligonucleotide is used in treatment of a preneoplastic/neoplastic disease associated with abnormal MN/CA IX expression.",
        "52-54. (canceled)",
        "55. An in vitro method of identifying agents capable of modulating levels of alternatively-spliced [AS] MN/CA IX, comprising contacting cells expressing AS MN/CA IX with an agent suspected of modulating the level of said AS MN/CA IX in the cells, and detecting and quantitating changes in levels of said AS MN/CA IX."
