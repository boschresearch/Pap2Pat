    "title": "Alternative splicing variant of the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase IX expressed independently of hypoxia and tumour phenotype",
    "date": "2007-11-20",
    "abstract": "CA IX is a hypoxia-induced, cancer-associated carbonic anhydrase isoform with functional involvement in pH control and cell adhesion. Here we describe an alternative splicing variant of the CA9 mRNA, which does not contain exons 8\u20139 and is expressed in tumour cells independently of hypoxia. It is also detectable in normal tissues in the absence of the full-length transcript and can therefore produce false-positive data in prognostic studies based on the detection of the hypoxia- and cancer-related CA9 expression. The splicing variant encodes a truncated CA IX protein lacking the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain. It shows diminished catalytic activity and is intracellular or secreted. When overexpressed, it reduces the capacity of the full-length CA IX protein to acidify extracellular pH of hypoxic cells and to bind carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. HeLa cells transfected with the splicing variant cDNA generate spheroids that do not form compact cores, suggesting that they fail to adapt to hypoxic stress. Our data indicate that the splicing variant can functionally interfere with the full-length CA IX. This might be relevant particularly under conditions of mild hypoxia, when the cells do not suffer from severe acidosis and do not need excessive pH control.",

The mouse splicing variant does not contain the exons 7 and 8 (GeneBank no. EF12497) and codes for the CA IX protein with deleted amino acids 335\u2013379, which lacks the C-terminal part of the catalytic (CA) domain (Supplementary Figure 1). The mouse AS protein expressed in the transfected NIH 3T3 and MDCK cells produced a single 48\u2009K band in immunoblotting and exhibited intracellular localisation in immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure 2).",
                        "This finding motivated us to search for the AS CA9 mRNA in human tissues and cell lines. We designed a set of primers that covered the entire human CA9 mRNA (Figure 1A). These were employed in RT\u2013PCR on cDNA templates reverse-transcribed from mRNAs isolated from the human stomach and small intestine. Using the primers designed against exons 1 and 6 we detected only a predicted PCR product (Figure 1B). However, the primers to exons 6 and 11 generated two PCR amplicons \u2013 a more abundant longer product and a much less abundant shorter product (Figure 1C). The intensity of the FL-related band was 19.8 times higher than that of the AS band in the stomach and 2.6 times in the small intestine. Sequence analysis of the shorter product confirmed that it corresponds to a human AS variant of CA9 mRNA. The splicing led to a deletion of exons 8 and 9 (GenBank no. EF122496).",
                        "To facilitate a separate detection of the FL and AS variants of CA9 mRNA, we utilised primers that allowed for their individual amplification. The design was based on placing one FL-specific primer (h8A) inside the deleted region and one AS-specific primer (h10/7A) on the alternative splicing-generated junction. Each of these primers was used in combination with h7S primer common for both transcripts (Figure 1A). The resulting fragments were of 154\u2009bp (FL) and 140\u2009bp (AS) in length, respectively. To quantify the amount of FL and AS transcripts and evaluate their relationship, we performed real-time PCR using these primer combinations. Results of three times repeated analyses revealed that the ratio of FL to AS was 19.6\u00b11.2 for the stomach (which is known to express a very high level of FL), 17.3\u00b11.1 for the small intestine, and 5.4\u00b10.1 for the colon (which is known to express lower level of FL than the stomach).",

The deletion eliminated 35 amino acids from the C-terminal part of the catalytic CA domain and 21 amino acids localised between the CA domain and the transmembrane region, which include Cys409 that appears to participate in the formation of intermolecular S\u2013S bonds (Figure 1D). Owing to a frameshift-generated stop codon at position 1119\u2009bp in AS mRNA (in FL CA9 mRNA, the stop codon is at position 1142\u2009bp), the AS protein is truncated and contains neither the transmembrane nor the intracytoplasmic domains (Figure 1E)."

The AS variant was detected in all examined cell lines and displayed similar levels under both normoxia and hypoxia (Figure 2A). This was in contrast to FL CA9 mRNA, which was clearly hypoxia-inducible and showed considerably increased levels, namely in Caski, SiHa, and ACHN cells, whereas CAKI-1 cells expressed only a very low level of FL CA9 (Figure 2A). No FL CA9-specific signal was observed in C33a cells that lack the CA9 gene (Lieskovska et al, 1999). Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed these data by showing considerable increase of FL to AS ratio under hypoxic conditions when compared to normoxia (5-fold in SiHa cells, 27-fold in Caski cells, and 8-fold in ACHN cells).",

The dense cells clearly showed normoxic expression of the FL CA9 mRNA, although its level was lower than in the hypoxic cells. No remarkable differences were observed between the cells cultivated in sparse and dense monolayer with regard to level of the AS variant (Figure 2B).",

In accord with the computer analysis that predicted splicing- and frameshift-mediated removal of TM and IC regions, the AS CA IX protein was not confined to the plasma membrane, but showed intracellular localisation in both, MDCK cells and in normoxic HeLa cells (Figure 3A).

Because of the complete absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains from the AS protein we also assumed that at least a portion of the AS CA IX molecules should be released into the culture medium. To investigate this possibility, the cells were cultivated under normoxia and hypoxia in the serum-free medium. After 24\u2009h of incubation, one-fourth of the culture medium was concentrated and analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE. Immunoblotting showed the presence of AS CA IX in the culture medium under both, normoxia and hypoxia (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data indicated that the AS is present in the intracellular as well as extracellular space, in contrast to FL CA IX, which is mostly confined to plasma membrane. Moreover, under non-reducing conditions, the FL protein formed oligomers of about 153\u2009K, whereas the AS CA IX variant was unable to do so and was also unable to enter into oligomers built by FL CA IX protein (Supplementary Figure 3, for details see Materials and Methods)."

Hypoxia also activates the catalytic performance of CA IX, which results in enhanced acidification of extracellular pH (Svastova et al, 2004). This acidification capacity can be abolished by the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant lacking the catalytic CA domain of CA IX (Svastova et al, 2004). Since the AS protein contains only incomplete CA domain, it was particularly important to analyse whether it is catalytically active and whether it is capable of disturbing acidification mediated by the FL CA IX protein.",
                        "Measurement of an enzyme activity was accomplished by stopped flow spectrometry using the recombinant bacterial GST-AS fusion protein containing the truncated CA domain compared to a GST-fused extracellular portion of the FL CA IX containing the complete CA domain (GST-PGCA). The results revealed that the catalytic activity of the wild-type CA IX, Kcat(WT)=3.8 \u00d7 105\u2009s\u22121, was reduced to half in the splicing variant, Kcat(AS)=1.9 \u00d7 105\u2009s\u22121. In addition, GST-AS protein showed considerably lower affinity for acetazolamine, a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases: Ki WT=14\u2009nM vs Ki AS=110\u2009nM. These data suggest that splicing has compromised both, the enzyme activity of CA IX and its affinity to inhibitors.",
                        "We also wanted to learn whether the AS CA IX can modulate the capacity of the FL CA IX to acidify extracellular pH under hypoxic conditions. For that purpose we analysed the transfected HeLa-AS cells and the mock-transfected controls incubated for 48\u2009h in 2% O2 (hypoxia) and 21% O2 (normoxia). Hypoxic incubation led to expected extracellular acidification in the control and in AS-transfected HeLa cells when compared to their normoxic counterparts (Figure 4A). However, the medium was approximately 0.2\u2009pH unit less acidified in the AS-overexpressing cells, suggesting that the AS disturbed the activity of the wild-type CA IX protein.",
                        "Since the catalytic site of CA IX is exposed to extracellular space, we tested a possible role of the extracellular fraction of AS. As described earlier, the activity of CA IX can be indirectly demonstrated using the fluorescein-labelled CA inhibitor (FITC-CAI) that binds only to hypoxia-activated CA IX whose catalytic site is accessible by the inhibitor (Svastova et al, 2004). Therefore, we used an established model of CA IX-transfected MDCK cells that show CA IX-mediated extracellular acidification when treated by hypoxia and accumulate FITC-CAI in hypoxia but not in normoxia. Here we analysed the accumulation of FITC-CAI in MDCK-CA IX cells in the presence and absence of the culture medium from the AS-secreting MDCK-AS transfectants. As shown on Figure 4B, incubation of MDCK-CA IX cells in the fresh medium mixed with the AS-containing conditioned medium resulted in visibly reduced accumulation of FITC-CA IX supporting the idea that the extracellular AS diminished the binding of the inhibitor. This experiment has been repeated with one-half and one-third of the AS-containing conditioned medium. The acquired images were analysed to determine the differences in the intensity of fluorescence. The results clearly proved that the extracellular fraction of AS reduced FITC-CAI accumulation approximately to one half (Figure 4C).",
                        "To see whether the effect of the AS variant on the functioning of the FL CA IX could have biological consequences, we analysed the growth parameters of the HeLa-AS transfectants compared to the mock-transfected controls. No significant differences were observed between these two cell types upon their short-term (72\u2009h) growth in the adherent culture independently of normoxic or hypoxic conditions (data not shown). Therefore, we also produced HeLa cell spheroids grown for 14 days and compared the mass and shape of the spheroids generated from the HeLa-AS cells and the control HeLa cells, respectively. The HeLa-AS spheroids were less compact and lacked the central region, which usually contains the cells that suffer from low oxygen and acidic pH (Figure 4D). The appearance of these HeLa-AS spheroids suggested that the effect of AS, which leads to reduced capacity of the FL CA IX to modulate pH could influence the capability of cells to survive these microenvironmental stresses.",
                        "Altogether, our results showed that the AS CA IX is differently regulated, abnormally localised, and functionally diminished when compared to FL CA IX."

                "Alternative splicing is an important molecular mechanism that significantly contributes to structural and functional diversification of proteins. It frequently results from differential exon inclusion and leads to altered domain composition, subcellular localisation, interaction potential, signalling capacity, and other changes at the protein level. Data obtained by recent genomic technologies indicate that over 60% of human genes are alternatively spliced. It is also becoming more and more evident that imbalances in the expression of alternative splicing variants can significantly affect cell phenotype and play a role in various pathologies (Matlin et al, 2005).",
                "Deregulation of alternative splicing is a well-recognised phenomenon particularly in cancer (Venables, 2006). There are numerous examples of alternatively spliced genes whose products are causally involved in tumour progression, such as CD44, HIF-\u03b1, VEGF, osteopontin, and many others (Gothie et al, 2000; Robinson and Stringer, 2001; Wong et al, 2003; He et al, 2006). In some cases, the splice form that is rare in normal tissues can become common in tumours, while the alternative splice form present in normal tissues can remain constant (Roy et al, 2005).",
                "The alternative splicing variant of the human CA IX identified in this study can be classified to this category, although it is difficult to make a clear-cut conclusion, since the expression pattern of the full-length CA IX is quite particular. The FL CA IX is abundant in very few normal tissues including the stomach and small intestine, which at the same time express a low level of the alternative-splicing variant. In gastric carcinomas, the expression of the FL CA IX decreases, but the level of AS is similar as in the normal stomach. In contrast, the expression of the full-length CA IX is absent or very low in the normal colon and rectum (and also in additional normal tissues not analysed in this study) and significantly increases in corresponding tumours (Saarnio et al, 1998). However, the AS variant shows a steady expression level in both normal tissues and colorectal carcinomas. These data strongly suggest that its expression is not linked to tumour phenotype. Moreover, in contrast to the FL CA IX whose levels are induced in the cells growing in crowded culture and exposed to low oxygen, the AS variant is not principally dependent on hypoxia and cell density.",
                "Relatively low, but steady expression of AS is of considerable importance for clinical studies using CA9 transcription as a marker of hypoxic tumours for potential prognostic or predictive purposes. Because of the presence of the AS CA9 transcript in the normal and/or non-hypoxic tissues, primers or probes designed for detection of the regions that are not affected by splicing cannot differentiate between the two forms of CA9 mRNA and thus might give false-positive results, which could influence the real clinical value of the hypoxia-induced FL CA9.",
                "It is noteworthy that 5\u2032 RACE analysis of the AS mRNA compared to the FL transcript has generated products of identical length supporting the conclusion that both variants are produced from the same promoter (data not shown). This fact might suggest a differential cooperation of the transcriptional apparatus with the components of the splicing machinery in the processing of the CA9 transcript depending on the physiological circumstances. Indeed, there are several examples of the splicing events regulated by hypoxia such as those related to hTERT, TrkA, and XBP1 (Romero-Ramirez et al, 2004; Taconelli et al, 2004; Anderson et al, 2006). In the case of hTERT, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional complex containing RNA polymerase II, TFIIB, HIF, and coactivators recruits at the promoter under hypoxia and remains associated with the gene as long as transcription proceeds. This induces a switch in the splice pattern in favour of an active form of the enzyme (Anderson et al, 2006). A similar mechanism might operate during the transcription of the CA9 gene. In addition, recent studies show that splicing can respond to changes in the extracellular microenvironment (Pleiss et al, 2007) or to signal transduction through post-translational modifications of spliceosome components (reviewed in Shin and Manley, 2004). For example, activation of the Ras pathway induces inclusion of the metastasis-associated exon v5 in CD44 transcript via phosphorylation of the RNA-binding protein Sam68 and via splicing of the coactivator SRm160 (Matter et al, 2002; Cheng and Sharp, 2006). So, it is quite possible that FL splicing is induced in the presence of hypoxia by HIF pathway-stimulated modification of splicing factors.",
                "The AS variant of the human CA9 mRNA results from the deletion of exons 8 plus 9 and is translated to truncated protein, which does not contain the transmembrane region, intracellular tail, and C-terminal part of the catalytic domain. Removal of the TM and IC regions is apparently responsible for the altered localisation of this AS variant, which predominantly occupies intracellular space and is also released to the extracellular medium. This is in contrast with the FL CA IX protein, which is an integral plasma membrane protein. Such inappropriate localisation linked with a partial deletion of the catalytic domain can be expected to compromise the protein functionality. Indeed, GST-AS shows only one half of the enzyme activity of the corresponding GST-PG+CA protein containing the complete catalytic domain. However, it is very difficult to translate this finding directly into local cellular context, where CA IX interacts with bicarbonate transporters and contributes to pH regulation across the plasma membrane under hypoxic conditions (Svastova et al, 2004; Morgan et al, 2007; Swietach et al, 2007). First, activity measurements were performed with the proteins produced in bacteria in a setting free of any subcellular structures, protein\u2013protein interactions, ion fluxes, and microenvironmental influences, which certainly play a role in modulating the catalytic performance of CA IX. Second, the catalytic activities of different carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes vary roughly within two orders of magnitude, with the highly active isoforms showing from 20 to only 3 times higher activity than the isoenzymes that are considered moderate (Pastorekova et al, 2004). So it is not possible to preclude whether the half-reduced activity would be sufficient for the physiological function of CA IX. Anyhow, this question is probably not critical, since the AS variant is not properly localised at the plasma membrane and is unable to form oligomers, which are very important constraints for the CA IX protein functioning.",
                "However, reduced extracellular acidification observed in the culture of hypoxic HeLa-AS cells that constitutively overexpress the AS form of CA IX clearly indicates that it interferes with the function of endogenous, hypoxia-induced FL protein. Although the mechanism is not clear at present, based on the decreased accumulation of CA inhibitor in the hypoxic MDCK-CA IX cells treated with the secreted AS variant, we can propose that AS might compete with the FL CA IX for an interaction with the cell surface components of the bicarbonate transport metabolon (since this interaction appears to include the extracellular portion of CA IX as demonstrated by Morgan et al, 2007). Moreover, overexpression of AS considerably affects the capacity of HeLa cells to form compact spheroids, which are often used as a 3D model that mimics tumour mass with corresponding intratumoral microenvironment. Many studies well document gradients of oxygen partial pressure, pH, nutrients, and metabolites across the spheroids whose core regions show a clear analogy with the hypoxic areas of solid tumours that are characterised by a more acidic microenvironment (Alvarez-P\u00e9rez et al, 2005). It has been shown elsewhere that the plasma membrane staining of the FL CA IX is significantly increased in the innermost cells of multicellular spheroids generated from SiHa and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells (Olive et al, 2001; Chrastina et al, 2003). These data indicate that FL CA IX is present exactly in the areas where the cells need increased protection and/or adaptation to harmful effects of the hypoxic stress and acidic microenvironment to survive. The FL CA IX acts here via bicarbonate-mediated buffering of intracellular pH (Swietach et al, 2007). The AS variant that partially perturbs this pH regulation, obviously does not permit the adaptation to acidic intra-spheroid pH, leading to elimination of the most stressed central cells from the core of spheroids. This idea is consistent with the findings that the catalytic activity of CA IX is regulated by hypoxia and suggests that the capacity of CA IX to modulate pH is vital for the survival of hypoxic tumour cells. The latter suggestion has been indirectly supported also by RNAi experiments by Robertson et al (2004). However, it is also possible that the AS protein released to the culture medium can modulate spheroid formation via binding to the transport unrelated receptor and stimulate or block signal transduction in autocrine or paracrine fashion. The literature contains several examples of splicing-truncated proteins functioning in this manner (Aasheim et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2006).",
                "Although the naturally produced AS variant is expressed at a low level, there are physiological situations and cell types that only weakly induce FL CA IX. For example tumour cells localised at shorter distances from functional blood-supplying vessels are exposed to mild hypoxia and may express comparable levels of FL and AS thus allowing for dominant-negative down modulation of CA IX activity. Such weakly hypoxic cells are presumably not exposed to severe acidosis and therefore may not benefit from full performance of this pH control mechanism. A similar explanation can be applied also to normal tissues suffering from mild ischaemia. This idea finds support in the recent as well as previous data showing that some tumour cell lines, dense normoxic cells (affected by weak pericellular hypoxia) and some early stage less-hypoxic tumours express just low levels of FL CA IX. In conclusion, we propose that the AS variant functions as a modulator of the FL CA IX under circumstances when both proteins are coexpressed."
