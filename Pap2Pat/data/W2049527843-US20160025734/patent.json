                        "Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed form of cancer in the world and the sixth most deadly form of male cancer.1 In 2013, in the United States alone, it is projected that prostate cancer (PCa) will account for 28% (238 590) of cancer cases and 10% (29 720) of cancer deaths2. PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) are common diseases of the aging male3 and share similar symptoms of frequent urination, nocturia, difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, hematuria, dysuria, erectal dysfunction, and painful ejaculation.4-8 Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common benign disease among men worldwide and its incidence increases with age. A male infant born today has an approximate one in six lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer.9 As with BPH, the incidence of prostate cancer increases as men age beyond 40. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is elaborated by both benign and malignant prostate cells. An elevated serum PSA can be detected with either benign or malignant growth of the prostate. A modest elevation of PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL confers an approximate 25 percent risk of a positive biopsy for prostate cancer.10 It is the demographic overlap of BPH and prostate cancer, and the lack of discrimination between these two prostate diseases by PSA, that defines the diagnostic dilemma confronting clinicians who treat prostate disease.",
                        "The PSA test has been widely used as a diagnostic, screening, and monitoring tool since it was first approved in 1986 by the US Food and Drug Administration as an aid for the early detection of prostate cancer.11 However, the PSA test lacks high sensitivity and specificity for PCa and PSA levels are frequently elevated in benign conditions, including BPH.12 This leads to the situation in which men continue to be over-diagnosed and unnecessarily biopsied with indolent disease or BPH.13 Side effects of prostate biopsies have been associated with infection, bleeding, urinary difficulty, fever, urinary retention, prostatitis, urosepsis, hematuria, and hematospermia.14 Post-biopsy infection rates of 8% (even with antibiotic prophylaxis) have been reported.15 A variety of permutations of PSA have been utilized to attempt to enhance the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of PSA screening. However, age-adjusted PSA ranges, PSA velocity, PSA density, and free PSA fraction have all been disappointing in their ability to discriminate between BPH and prostate cancer,16 making it very difficult to differentiate between these two diseases in a clinical setting. Currently, prostate cancer prognosis is based on age, elevated levels of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and a prostatic digital rectal examination (DRE) often followed by prostate biopsy.17",
                        "In May 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) announced that PSA screening for prostate cancer demonstrated small potential benefit against a backdrop of potential harms.18 There is, therefore, an urgent need for novel biomarkers that can distinguish between patients with BPH vs. PCa."

                        "As used herein, \u201cprostate cancer\u201d refers to any cancer of the prostate gland in which cells of the prostate mutate and begin to multiply out of control. The term \u201cprostate cancer\u201d includes early stage, localized cancer of the prostate gland; later stage, locally advanced cancer of the prostate gland; and later stage metastatic cancer of the prostate gland (in which the cancer cells spread (metastasize) from the prostate to other parts of the body, especially the bones and lymph nodes). Prostate cancer can include adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, intraepithelial neoplasia, or sarcoma. Prostate cancers can be encapsulated or metastatic.",
                        "As used herein \u201cbenign prostatic hyperplasia\u201d or hypertrophy\u201d (BPH) refers to a disease or condition of the prostate gland wherein the prostate is enlarged or exhibits hyperplasia. BPH is not prostate cancer. BPH is a common urological condition caused by the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland in aging men. BPH affects the inner part of the prostate first\u2014the part that encircles the urethra as it leaves the bladder. (The urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and out of the body). As the prostate grows, it may begin to squeeze the upper part of the urethra and restrict the flow of urine. This can cause men to have trouble urinating leading to the symptoms of BPH.",
                        "Traditionally, malignant disease is ruled out by performing a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. However, the subject of PSA screening to detect prostate cancer continues to engender significant controversy. In May 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) announced that PSA screening for prostate cancer demonstrated small potential benefit and exposed patients to potential harms. The American Urological Association, however, responded with its own updated guidelines that, in properly selected patients, PSA screening is beneficial and can save lives.27 The underpinning of this honest disagreement is that PSA is produced by both benign and malignant prostate tissue and no PSA value can rule out the possibility of prostate malignancy, as Thompson and colleagues reported on 2950 men who were part of the Prostate Cancer Prevention study.28 The men in the study ranged in age from 62 to 91 years, and prostate cancer was diagnosed in 449 of them (15.2%). However, prostate cancer was diagnosed even in those men who had very low PSA levels. The prevalence of prostate cancer was 6.6 percent among men with a PSA level of up to 0.5 ng/ml, 10.1 percent among those with values of 0.6 to 1.0 ng/ml, 17 percent among those with values of 1.1 to 2.0 ng/ml, 23.9 percent among those with values of 2.1 to 3.0 ng/ml, and 26.9 percent among those with values of 3.1 to 4.0 ng/ml. The authors' overall findings were that as many as 15 percent of men with so-called \u201cnormal\u201d PSA levels did, in fact, have prostate cancer. Thus, this study demonstrated the unreliability of PSA testing alone to diagnose prostate cancer and underscored the need for new biomarkers with increased sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection.",
                        "The biomarkers described herein were able to independently discriminate between BPH and early stages of PCa. In addition, when these markers are multiplexed, the accuracy in differentiating between BPH and early PCa is further increased. Importantly, the described panel of biomarkers, when multiplexed with clinically defined categories of PSA, effectively distinguishes BPH from early PCa with high sensitivity and specificity.",

Modern laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (\u201cLDI-MS\u201d) can be practiced in two main variations: matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (\u201cMALDI\u201d) mass spectrometry and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (\u201cSELDI\u201d). In MALDI, the analyte is mixed with a solution containing a matrix, and a drop of the liquid is placed on the surface of a substrate. The matrix solution then co-crystallizes with the biological molecules. The substrate is inserted into the mass spectrometer. Laser energy is directed to the substrate surface where it desorbs and ionizes the biological molecules without significantly fragmenting them. However, MALDI has limitations as an analytical tool. It does not provide means for fractionating the sample, and the matrix material can interfere with detection, especially for low molecular weight analytes. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,118,937 and 5,045,694.",

In another variant, the surface is derivatized with energy absorbing molecules that are not desorbed when struck with the laser. In another variant, the surface is derivatized with molecules that bind the protein of interest and that contain a photolytic bond that is broken upon application of the laser. In each of these methods, the derivatizing agent generally is localized to a specific location on the substrate surface where the sample is applied. See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The ions generated are collected by an ion optic assembly, and then in a time-of-flight mass analyzer, ions are accelerated through a short high voltage field and let drift into a high vacuum chamber. At the far end of the high vacuum chamber, the accelerated ions strike a sensitive detector surface at a different time.

The concentration of one or more biomarker antigen in a biological sample is measured by having the antigen in the biological sample compete with the labeled (e.g., radioactively) antigen for binding to an antibody to the antigen. To ensure competitive binding between the labeled antigen and the unlabeled antigen, the labeled antigen is present in a concentration sufficient to saturate the binding sites of the antibody. The higher the concentration of antigen in the sample, the lower the concentration of labeled antigen that will bind to the antibody.",

The multivalent antigen conjugate must have at least 2 antigen residues per molecule and the antigen residues must be of sufficient distance apart to allow binding by at least two antibodies to the antigen. For example, in an IRMA the multivalent antigen conjugate can be attached to a solid surface such as a plastic sphere. Unlabeled \u201csample\u201d antigen and antibody to antigen which is radioactively labeled are added to a test tube containing the multivalent antigen conjugate coated sphere.

These proteins represent a number of different functional categories including cell assembly and organization, cell signaling, cell morphology, carbohydrate metabolism, cellular growth and proliferation, lipid metabolism, androgen and estrogen metabolism, and DNA replication, recombination, and repair, among others (FIGS. 4A and 4B).

                                "26 proteins were differentially expressed in the urine of patients diagnosed with BPH vs. PCa as originally identified by iTRAQ (FIG. 1). Given that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for these proteins were not available, nine proteins were tested based on the availability of antibodies, and then six proteins were validated: \u03b2-2-microglobulin (\u03b22M), pepsinogen 3, group 1 (PGA3), intestinal mucin (MUC3), apolipoprotein D (APOD), alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc (ZAG), and uromodulin (THP) (FIG. 2). These analyses provided validation that \u03b22M, PGA3 and MUC3 were differentially expressed in the urine of patients diagnosed with PCa and BPH.",
                                "Univariate analysis was performed to compare BPH and PCa groups with respect to age, and each of the candidate urinary biomarkers (Table 1).",
                                "These comparisons, based on continuous data, revealed significant elevations in \u03b22M (P<0.001), PGA3 (P=0.006), and MUC3 25 kDa (P=0.018). The optimal cut-off values was then identified using ROC analysis with the Youden index for each of the three significant urinary biomarkers, and the analysis indicated \u226740 DU for \u03b22M, \u2267190 DU for PGA3, and \u2267185 DU for MUC3. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was then conducted using the chosen cut-off values for each of the three significant biomarkers in the univariate analysis as well as PSA (using three clinically defined categories: 0-4 ng/mL, 4.1-10 ng/mL, >10 ng/mL).",
                                "The probability of PCa was determined using multivariate logistic regression modeling according to the each of the urinary biomarkers, \u03b22M, PGA3, MUC3, as well as PSA in the predictive model. Here, having determined the optimal cut-off value for each biomarker based on the Youden J-index in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the binary predictors (i.e., above and below each cut-off) stratified according to clinically relevant categories of PSA were used. Thus, the probabilities shown in each panel of FIG. 3 are based on two levels of the biomarker for each of three PSA categories (0-4, 4.1-10, >10 ng/mL). The multivariate modeling strategy uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to derive the probability of PCa based on combinations of the biomarkers within each PSA category. This figure illustrates that the estimated probability of PCa within each PSA category is significantly higher in patients who are above the cut-off value for the biomarker and that the probability of PCa is higher with increasing PSA. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses revealed that if the levels of \u03b22M are less than 40 DU, if the PGA3 levels are less than 195 DU and the MUC3 levels are less than 185 DU, the predictive accuracy is improved to 45%, 53% and 45%, respectively. However, when the DU levels are equal to or higher than 40 DU of \u03b22M, 195 DU of PGA3 and 185 DU of MUC3, the diagnostic accuracy is remarkably improved to 74%, 77% and 72%, respectively (FIG. 3). In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) clearly shows a steeper curve for the three urinary biomarkers (MUC3, PGA3, \u03b22M) as well as for the three biomarkers plus PSA categories (FIG. 6).",
                                "To determine the predictive accuracy of each of the significant independent multivariate biomarkers based on the optimal cutoff values and PSA based on the three categories, ROC analysis was used to assess the AUC for single biomarkers and the combination of three with and without PSA (Table 2).",
                                "Single biomarkers had AUC values ranging from 0.618 for MUC3 25 kDa (P=0.009) to 0.668 for \u03b22M (P<0.001); the combination of \u03b22M, PGA3 and MUC3 25 kDa increased the AUC to 0.710 (95% CI: 0.631-0.788, P<0.001). Predictive accuracy was 0.734 based on PSA categories alone and significantly increased to 0.812 for the three biomarkers with PSA categories (P=0.004, Delong test for comparing ROC curves). False positive (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR) are highly relevant in clinical practice and we have evaluated the FPR and FNR for each of the three significant multivariate predictive biomarkers in differentiating between BPH and PCa. It is clear that compared to each of the three urinary biomarkers alone, the panel of three biomarkers combined provide much lower FPRs and FNRs based on all patients in the study population. The combination of three biomarkers together (\u03b22M, PGA3, MUC3) shows an FPR of 30% and a range of FNRs from 0% to 8%, which is considered clinically acceptable.",
                                "Univariate analysis revealed that PIK3IP1 is significantly elevated (Table 3) in PCa patients (P=0.002). Diagnostic accuracy for each biomarker and their combination was based on optimal cut off values from ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis (Table 4). Moreover, multivariate logistic regression based on optimal PIK3IP1 cut off values was used to derive the probability of PCa for PIK3IP1 stratified by the clinically defined categories of PSA. Probability of PCa within each of the three PSA categories is shown based on whether or not the patient's PIK3IP1 is >5.6 DU or <5.6 DU, and these probabilities increase with higher PSA (FIG. 7)."

The U.S. Preventive Task Force strongly rejected the utility of PSA screening for prostate cancer and this study was designed to determine if new urinary markers would be more informative in discriminating between BPH and prostate cancer which is the problem facing clinicians. The clinical challenge is differentiating BPH from prostate cancer.",
                                "In recent years, urinary biomarkers have emerged as an attractive option for the noninvasive detection of PCa.21,29-31 Given the complexity of this disease, it is now widely appreciated that a single marker may not necessarily reflect the multifactorial nature of BPH or PCa.29 A panel, rather than any individual biomarker, will have a higher likelihood to more accurately distinguish between BPH and early stages of PCa in conjunction with clinicopathological parameters. In contrast, the newly identified biomarkers, such as \u03b22M, PGA3, MUC3 and PIK3IP1, effectively discriminated BPH from early PCa.",
                                "A protein found to be significantly elevated in urine of PCa patients was mucin 3 (MUC3), a member of the membrane-associated mucins, which may be shed from the cell surface via activation of membrane-associated metalloproteinases.32-34 Previous studies showed a correlation between elevated MUC3 expression and esophageal,35 gastric,36 breast,37 and colon cancer.38 In this study, MUC3 was able to differentiate between BPH and early PCa. In addition, the ability of MUC3 to discriminate between BPH and early PCa was strengthened when MUC3 was multiplexed with clinically defined categories of PSA, making it a prospective biomarker for differentiating BPH from early PCa.",
                                "Pepsinogen 3, group 1 (PGA3) was also found to be elevated in the urine of PCa patients but not in BPH. PGA3 is synthesized and secreted by the gastric chief cells of the human stomach before being converted into the proteolytic enzyme pepsin A, an upstream step in the digestive process.39 Low levels of PGA in serum40 as well as decreased or lost expression of PGA in gastric tissue and cancer cell lines were previously reported.41 In contrast, a recent study demonstrated increased mRNA levels of PGA in seven colorectal cancer cell lines.42 Interestingly, this study is the first to report that PGA3 can be used to distinguish between patients with BPH or with early-stage PCa.",

Increased expression of \u03b22M has been previously associated with breast,43 renal,44 lung,45 colon,46 and hematologic malignancies.47 \u03b22M levels were also significantly elevated in urine48 and in serum49 of prostate cancer patients compared to healthy subjects. This is the first study demonstrating that \u03b22M effectively discriminates between BPH and early stages of PCa.",

In addition, when these markers are multiplexed, the accuracy in differentiating between BPH and early PCa is further increased. Importantly, this small panel of biomarkers, when multiplexed with clinically defined categories of PSA, effectively distinguishes BPH from early PCa with high sensitivity and specificity. In summary, noninvasive urine tests utilizing the biomarkers described herein, such as \u03b22M, PGA3, PIK3IP1 and MUC3 in combination with clinically defined categories of PSA, have the potential to resolve the diagnostic dilemma of effectively discriminating between BPH and early PCa in the clinic."
