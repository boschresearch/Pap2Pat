                        "Research into the biosynthesis, secretion, and signaling of insulin has led to the development of important treatments for diabetes. In contrast, despite 60 years of speculation that inhibiting the degradation of insulin could treat diabetes, and the identification of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a diabetes susceptibility gene, the relationship between IDE activity and glucose homeostasis remains unclear due to the lack of IDE inhibitors that are active in vivo.",
                        "Insulin-degrading enzyme, also sometimes referred to as insulysin or insulin protease, is a 110 kDa zinc-binding protease of the M16A metalloprotease subfamily. IDE was first identified by its ability to degrade the \u03b2 chain of insulin and has since been shown to target additional substrates, including the pathophysiologically important peptide \u03b2-amyloid, and the signaling peptides glucagon, TGF-alpha, \u03b2-endorphin, and atrial natriuric peptide. While IDE is the main protease responsible for insulin degradation, most other IDE substrates are known to be targeted and degraded by other proteases as well, and the effect of IDE inhibition on such substrates has not been delineated.",
                        "Despite great interest in pharmacological targeting of IDE, the enzyme has remained an elusive target. The only known series of IDE-targeted inhibitors to date are peptide hydroxamic acids, e.g., Ii1 (Inhibitor of IDE1, see FIG. 1e and, e.g., Leissring et al. (2010), Designed Inhibitors of Insulin-Degrading Enzyme Regulate the Catabolism and Activity of Insulin.

                        "One important application for IDE inhibitors is the treatment of diabetes, a group of endocrinological disorders that are characterized by impaired insulin signaling or insulin resistance. Conventional therapeutic approaches for diabetic patients aim to enhance insulin signaling, for example, by administration of exogenous insulin, by stimulating the generation and secretion of endogenous insulin, or by activating downstream targets of the insulin receptor (IR) signaling cascade. IDE inhibitors open another therapeutic avenue to improve insulin signaling by inhibiting IDE-mediated insulin catabolism."

                        "Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the discovery and characterization of the first potent, selective, and physiologically active IDE inhibitor, which was identified from a DNA-templated macrocycle library. A co-crystal structure of the inhibitor bound to IDE reveals that this macrocycle engages a novel binding site that explains its remarkable selectivity for IDE. Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the discovery that IDE-binding and IDE-inhibiting compounds can be identified by using competitive binding assays in which a candidate compound competes with a probe comprising a known IDE-binding molecule, e.g., an IDE inhibitor as described herein such as compound 6bk.",
                        "Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the surprising discovery from the treatment of lean and obese mice with IDE inhibitors under a variety of different conditions that IDE regulates the abundance and signaling of glucagon and amylin, in addition to that of insulin. Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the surprising discovery that, under physiologic conditions that augment insulin and amylin levels, such as oral glucose administration, acute IDE inhibition can lead to substantially improved glucose tolerance and slower gastric emptying. In addition, some aspects of this disclosure are based on the surprising discovery that acute IDE inhibition can modulate the effects of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) signaling, e.g., augment CGRP-induced blood glucose level fluctuations, and reduce CGRP-induced blood pressure and heart rate increases. It was also discovered that acute IDE inhibition can lower baseline blood pressure and heart rate. These discoveries transform the previous understanding of IDE's roles in glucose regulation and demonstrate a potential therapeutic strategy of modulating IDE activity to treat type-2 diabetes.",
                        "Some aspects of this disclosure provide methods for identifying insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)-binding compounds. Such methods are useful for the identification of novel IDE modulators, e.g., inhibitors with improved IDE-binding properties as compared to currently known IDE inhibitors, and IDE activators. In general, the methods comprise contacting an IDE with a probe that binds IDE with an IC50 of 10 \u03bcM or less, wherein the probe comprises a detectable label, and with a candidate compound under conditions suitable for the probe and the candidate compound to bind the IDE; determining the level of unbound probe in the presence of the candidate compound; and comparing the level of unbound probe to a reference level, wherein if the level of unbound probe in the presence of the candidate compound is higher than the reference level, then the candidate compound is identified as an IDE-binding compound. In some embodiments, the IDE-binding probe comprises a macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule. In some embodiments, the macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule comprises a compound of any of Formula (I)-(VI). In some embodiments, the macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule comprises a structure selected from the group consisting of structures 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6a, 6c, 6b, 6bk, and 7-29. In some embodiments, the macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule comprises structure 6bk. In some embodiments, the macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule is conjugated to the detectable label. In some embodiments, the macrocyclic IDE-binding molecule is conjugated to the detectable label via a linker. In some embodiments, the detectable label comprises a fluorophore. In some embodiments, the probe is compound 31.",
                        "In some embodiments, determining the level of unbound probe in the presence of the candidate compound comprises exposing IDE contacted with the probe and the candidate compound to incident, plane-polarized light of a suitable wave length to excite the fluorophore; and detecting the level of fluorescent light emitted by the fluorophore in the same plane of polarization as the incident light, as well as the level of fluorescent light emitted by the fluorophore in a plane different from the plane of polarization of the incident light. In some embodiments, determining the level of unbound probe in the presence of the candidate compound comprises calculating the level of unbound probe from the levels of emitted light detected. In some embodiments, the calculating the level of unbound probe comprises calculating a ratio of the levels of emitted light detected, or calculating a fluorescence anisotropy value.",
                        "In some embodiments, the candidate compound is identified as an IDE-binding compound if the level of fluorescent light emitted by the fluorophore in the presence of the candidate compound in a plane different from the plane of polarization of the incident light is higher than a reference level of fluorescent light emitted in that plane measured in the absence of the candidate compound. In some embodiments, the method is carried out repeatedly for a candidate compound at a plurality of IDE concentrations, and the method comprises calculating a ratio of the levels of emitted light detected, or calculating a fluorescence anisotropy value for each concentration; and determining a dynamic IDE concentration range. In some embodiments, the candidate compound is identified as an IDE-binding compound if the level of fluorescent light emitted by the fluorophore in the presence of the candidate compound in a plane different from the plane of polarization of the incident light is at least 1.1-fold, at least 1.2-fold, at least 1.3-fold, at least 1.5-fold, at least 1.75-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 2.5-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 30-fold, at least 40-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 200-fold, at least 500-fold, or at least 1000-fold higher than a reference level of fluorescent light emitted in that plane measured in the absence of the candidate compound. In some embodiments, the candidate compound is identified as an IDE-binding compound if the fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of the candidate compound is at least 1.1-fold to at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold to at least 100-fold, or at least 200-fold to at least 1000-fold lower than the fluorescence anisotropy in the absence of the candidate compound. In some embodiments, the level of emitted light or the fluorescent anisotropy is measured at a point within the dynamic IDE concentration range.",

In some embodiments, the binding agent comprises a ligand. In some embodiments, the ligand is biotin or an avidin derivative. In some embodiments, the probe comprises compound 30. In some embodiments, the detectable label comprises a detectable isotope.",
                        "In some embodiments, IDE is contacted with the probe and the candidate compound in aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the IDE is contacted with the probe and the candidate compound under physiological conditions. In some embodiments, the method comprises screening a library of different candidate compounds. In some embodiments, the reference level represents a level of unbound probe in the absence of the candidate compound. In some embodiments, the reference level is determined by measuring the level of unbound probe in the absence of a candidate compound or in the presence of a compound known to bind IDE with an IC50 of more than 10 \u03bcM. In some embodiments, the probe comprises an IDE inhibitor, and the candidate compound is identified as an IDE inhibitor if it can successfully compete with the probe for IDE binding.",

In some embodiments, the methods provided herein are useful to determine competitive IDE-binding of a candidate compound in the presence of an IDE-binding probe. In general, such methods include contacting an IDE with a candidate compound in the presence of the IDE-binding probe, and identifying a candidate compound as an IDE-binding compound, if the candidate compound is able to bind IDE, thus replacing some or all of the bound probe. The use of an IDE-binding probe as a competitor for IDE-binding is advantageous over non-competitive binding assays because it circumvents the requirement to directly assess the interaction of a candidate compound with IDE or the modulation of IDE activity by a candidate compound, thus allowing for screening a variety of candidate compound structures with a single type of assay, or using a single probe. The use of competitive binding assays also allows for decreasing the incidence of low-affinity binders by using a high-affinity probe, and for identifying candidates that compete with the probe for a specific IDE binding site. Some aspects of this disclosure provide IDE-binding probes designed to bind a unique site of IDE, which contributes to the probes high specificity for binding IDE.",

Briefly, it was found that a potent IDE inhibitor, macrocycle 6b, occupies a binding pocket at the interface of IDE domains 1 and 2 and is positioned more than 11 \u212b away from the zinc ion in the IDE active site. This site does not overlap with the binding site of the substrate-mimetic inhibitor Ii1, suggesting that the macrocycle competes with substrate binding and abrogates key interactions that are necessary to bind peptide substrates for cleavage (see FIG. 2). Accordingly, where it is desirable to identify a compound binding a specific IDE site, e.g., the binding pocket for macrocycle 6b, the use of a compound binding the IDE site as a competitive probe in a binding assay will minimize the false-positive identification of candidate compounds that bind non-overlapping sites. The assays, methods, systems, kits, and reagents provided herein are thus useful in the identification of candidates that specifically target such binding sites, and in the discovery of novel IDE-inhibitor therapeutics and leads thereto.",

                                "In some embodiments, a fluorescence polarization assay is used to determine whether a candidate compound binds to IDE in the presence of an IDE-binding fluorescent probe. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the polarization of light emitted by a molecule is proportional to the molecule's rotational relaxation time, which varies with molecular volume, amongst other parameters. A small molecule, e.g., a free IDE-binding fluorescent probe as described herein, will thus be able to rotate and tumble more freely than an IDE-binding fluorescent probe that is bound to the much larger IDE molecule. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the determination of whether a candidate compound binds IDE is based on the theory that the rotation and tumbling of the probe is hindered when the probe is bound to IDE, while the probe can rotate and tumble freely once it is replaced from its IDE-binding site by the candidate compound. Accordingly, the level of polarization of light emitted from a fluorescent IDE-binding probe bound to an IDE will be higher in the absence of a candidate that is capable of successfully competing with the probe for the binding pocket, thus releasing the bound probe into the surrounding media where it can rotate and tumble freely, as compared to the level of polarization in the presence of a candidate compound that binds IDE with high affinity and replaces the probe at the IDE-binding site.",

As the degree of movement or the degree of polarization is related to the mobility of the fluorescent probe, and the mobility of the probe increases when it is replaced from its IDE binding site by a candidate compound, the measures shift in the level of polarization can be used to calculate the degree of probe replacement or candidate compound binding.",

In some embodiments, the fluorescence polarization measurement is performed after a time sufficient for the binding reaction reaching equilibrium. In some embodiments, the fluorescence polarization measurement is performed at a plurality of time points (including in real-time) before the binding reaction reaches equilibrium. In some such embodiments, the time in which the binding reaction (e.g., replacement of the bound probe by the candidate compound) reaches equilibrium and/or the kinetics of the binding reaction are measured.",

In some embodiments, the biological sample comprises a cell, a tissue, and/or a body fluid obtained from the subject. Exemplary body fluids include, without limitation, blood, serum, plasma, saliva, and urine. In some embodiments, a method for determining an amount of IDE or a level of IDE activity as provided herein comprises contacting a biological sample obtained from a subject with an IDE-binding probe described herein, and determining the amount or level of probe binding to IDE, if any, e.g., by a suitable detection assay provided herein.",
                                "For example, in some embodiments, such a method may comprise contacting a biological sample obtained from a subject with a probe that selectively binds IDE, e.g., a probe that comprises a macrocyclic compound conjugated to a detectable label, such as, for example, a compound comprising a structure selected from the group consisting of structures 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6a, 6c, 6b, 6bk, and 1-31. In some embodiments the amount of probe binding to IDE in the sample is quantified, for example, by an assay described herein, or by any other suitable assay. In some embodiments, the amount of probe binding to IDE in the biological sample is quantified by a fluorescence polarization assay, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, a fluorescence-based assay, an antibody-based assay, a solid-support-based assay, or an anisotropy assay. In some embodiments, the determined amount of IDE-bound probe is compared to a reference level, e.g., to a level of probe bound to IDE in a sample from a healthy subject, or an average level of probe bound to IDE in a population of subjects (e.g., age- and/or gender-matched subjects), or to a level representative of a healthy subject.",
                                "In some embodiments, if the amount of bound probe in the biological sample is higher, e.g., statistically significantly higher, than the reference level, the subject is indicated to exhibit an overabundance of IDE. In some embodiments, if the amount of bound probe in the biological sample is lower, e.g., statistically significantly lower, than the reference level, the subject is indicated to exhibit a deficiency of IDE. In some embodiments, the subject is diagnosed to have or to be predisposed to develop a disease associated with an aberrant level of IDE based on the level of IDE in the subject being higher or lower than the reference level. For example, in some such embodiments, the subject is diagnosed to have or to be predisposed to develop diabetes, pre-diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome, neurodegeneration, mental disorders, and/or cancer. In some embodiments, the subject is selected for a regimen of appropriate health care to treat or prevent the respective disorder."

                                "The data provided herein show that small-molecule IDE inhibitors can improve oral glucose tolerance to an extent comparable to that of DPP4 inhibitors. These data are relevant to human clinical applications, as evidenced by the repeated recognition of IDE as a diabetes susceptibility gene in humans.5-9 Additional in vivo and biochemical experiments described herein using 6bK led to the surprising discovery that IDE regulates the stability and signaling of glucagon and amylin, in addition to its established role in insulin degradation10-12. The identification of these two additional pancreatic hormones as endogenous IDE substrates advances our understanding of the role of IDE in regulating physiological glucose homeostasis (see FIG. 6). Amylin-mediated effects on gastric emptying and satiety during meals have been recently recognized to have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of diabetes,2,31 and the results presented herein represent the first demonstration of a small molecule that can regulate amylin signaling. Moreover, the link between IDE and glucagon revealed herein provides additional evidence of the importance of glucagon regulation in human diabetes.49",
                                "The data described herein reveals a specific pharmacological requirement for therapeutic IDE inhibition, namely, that transient, rather than chronic, IDE inhibition is desirable to prevent elevation of glucagon signaling in some embodiments49 (see FIG. 6). Based on this discovery, an anti-diabetic therapeutic strategy was developed that includes the use of a fast-acting IDE inhibitor that can be taken with a meal to transiently augment endogenous insulin and amylin responses to help control post-prandial glycaemia31,32, and that is cleared or degraded before glucagon secretion resumes. Similar pre-meal therapeutic strategies with short-lived agents have already proven successful with fast-acting insulin analogs, secretagogues, and amylin supplementation.32,33 Some aspects of this invention are based on the recognition that such agents have synergistic effects when co-administered with an IDE inhibitor3,50. Additionally, the combination of an IDE inhibitor with incretin therapy2,31 or a glucagon receptor antagonist49, is also recognized to be therapeutic, as evidenced by the experiments with glucagon-receptor deficient mice described herein.",
                                "Some aspects of this disclosure provide methods of administering an IDE inhibitor to a subject in order to improve insulin signaling. In some embodiments, these methods are useful for improving oral glucose tolerance, to modulate gastric emptying, and to modulate satiety during meals in a subject, for example, in a subject having diabetes. In some embodiments, the method involves administering an IDE inhibitor to a subject according to a dosing schedule that results in transient IDE inhibition, e.g., in temporal proximity to the intake of a meal. In some embodiments, the IDE inhibitor is administered according to a dosing schedule that results in transient IDE inhibition, but avoids or minimizes an elevation of glucagon signaling. In some embodiments, a method is provided that comprises administering an IDE inhibitor provided herein together with an additional therapeutic agent, e.g., with a pre-meal therapeutic agent, such as, for example, a fast-acting insulin analog, secretagogue (e.g., a substance that causes another substance to be secreted), amylin supplement, incretin therapy, or a glucagon receptor antagonist. Additional diabetes therapeutics are known to those of skill in the art and the disclosure is not limited in this respect. In some such embodiments, the IDE inhibitor and the additional therapeutic agent are in an amount that is individually effective to elicit the desired effect in a subject, e.g., the desired level and time period of transient IDE inhibition and the desired therapeutic effect of the additional agent. In some embodiments, the IDE inhibitor and the additional agent are administered at a dose that, by itself, would not result in a therapeutic effect, but that, in combination, results in a desired therapeutic effect.",

Accordingly, the in vivo methods of using the macrocyclic IDE inhibitors provided herein are useful in improving insulin signaling in subjects having a disease associated with IDE activity, or impaired insulin signaling, for example, in patients exhibiting metabolic syndrome or diabetes (e.g., Type I or Type II diabetes) while avoiding the negative effects of increased glucagon signaling that chronic IDE inhibition may effect.",

                                "The dynamic interplay between the production and proteolytic degradation of peptide hormones is a key mechanism underlying the regulation of human metabolism. Inhibition of the peptidases and proteases that degrade these hormones can elevate their effective concentrations and augment signaling. In some cases, the resulting insights can lead to the development of novel therapeutics1. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, for example, are anti-diabetic drugs that increase the concentration of the insulin-stimulating hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), resulting in elevated insulin concentrations and lower blood glucose levels2. Researchers have speculated for at least six decades that insulin signaling could also be augmented to improve glucose tolerance by inhibiting its degradation3,4. The zinc metalloprotease insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is thought to be the primary enzyme responsible for inactivation of insulin in the liver and kidney3,4. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified predisposing and protective variants of the IDE locus linked to type-2 diabetes (T2D)5-9, suggesting a functional connection between IDE and glucose regulation in humans.",
                                "Based on the known biochemistry of IDE, inhibition of this enzyme is expected to elevate insulin levels and augment the response to glucose3,4. While mice lacking a functional IDE gene (IDE\u2212/\u2212 mice) have elevated insulin levels, counterintuitively these animals exhibit impaired, rather than improved, glucose tolerance10,11 . Physiological studies with IDE\u2212/\u2212 mice concluded that chronic elevation of insulin in these animals results in a compensatory lowering of insulin receptor expression levels, which leads to impaired glucose clearance following a glucose load10,11. This model raises the possibility that in the absence of such compensatory effects, acute inhibition of IDE may lead to improved physiological glucose tolerance.",
                                "Acute inhibition of enzymes is typically achieved through the use of small-molecule inhibitors, but the only previously reported potent IDE inhibitor, a linear peptide mimetic (Ii1, FIG. 1), is not stable in vivo11,12. These observations highlight the need for a selective small-molecule IDE inhibitor to characterize the biological functions and therapeutic relevance of this enzyme in vivo13,14, uncoupled from confounding physiological adaptations that arise in IDE knock-out mice10,11. In this study we set out to discover potent and selective small-molecule IDE inhibitors that are active in vivo, and to use these compounds to reveal the physiological consequences of IDE inhibition.",

                                "To discover small-molecule modulators of IDE, we performed in vitro selections on a previously described DNA-templated library of 13,824 synthetic macrocycles15,16 for the ability to bind immobilized mouse IDE (FIG. 7). Each macrocycle in this library is attached to a unique DNA oligonucleotide that can be used to identify the structures of IDE-binding macrocycles16,17. High-throughput DNA sequencing revealed the macrocycle-encoding DNA templates enriched in two independent IDE selection experiments, resulting in the identification of six putative IDE-binding macrocycles that share common structural features (FIG. 1a, FIG. 7).",
                                "We synthesized these six macrocycles without the attached DNA using solid- and solution-phase synthesis as either of two possible cis- or trans-alkene stereoisomers16,17 (FIG. 7). Biochemical assays revealed that four of the six trans-macrocycles assayed were inhibitors of IDE with IC50\u22661.5 \u03bcM (FIG. 7). The most active inhibitor among the library members enriched in the selection, 20-membered macrocycle 6b (FIG. 1a), potently inhibited human IDE (IC50=60 nM). The ability of 6b to inhibit IDE proteolytic activity in vitro was confirmed by three complementary assays using a fluorogenic peptide, an insulin immunoassay, and a calcitonin-gene related peptide LC-MS assay (Data FIG. 8)18.",
                                "We synthesized and biochemically assayed 30 analogs of 6b in which each building block was systematically varied to elucidate structure-activity relationships of these inhibitors (FIG. 1b). These studies revealed the structural requirements required for potent IDE inhibition by this new class of molecules, including a trans-fused 20-membered macrocycle, the stereochemistry of the macrocycle substituents, and the size, shape, and hydrophobicity of the A and B building blocks (FIG. 1a). In contrast to the strict requirements at positions A and B, different building blocks were tolerated at position C (FIG. 1b). Based on these results, we identified the inhibitor 6bK (IC50=50 nM, FIG. 1c) as an ideal candidate for in vivo studies because it exhibits enhanced water solubility relative to 6b, and can be readily synthesized on gram scale (see Methods section)14.",
                                "Because selectivity is a crucial feature of effective probes to elucidate physiological functions14, we next characterized the protease inhibition selectivity of 6bK. This inhibitor exhibited \u22671,000-fold selectivity in vitro for IDE over all other metalloproteases tested: thimet oligopeptidase (THOP), neurolysin (NLN), neprilysin, matrix metalloprotease 1, and angiotensin converting-enzyme (FIG. 1f). In contrast, the previously reported substrate mimetic hydroxamic acid inhibitor Ii112 (FIG. 1e) is not as selective and it potently inhibits IDE (IC50=0.6 nM), THOP (IC50=6 nM), and NLN (IC50=185 nM) (FIG. 1g). The remarkable selectivity of 6bK, in contrast with the known promiscuity of some active site-directed metalloprotease inhibitors19, led us to speculate that the macrocycle engages a binding site distinct from the enzyme's active site. This hypothesis was supported by double-inhibitor kinetic assays that revealed synergistic, rather than competitive, inhibition by macrocycle 6b band substrate mimetic Ii1 (FIG. 8).",
                                "**Structural Basis of IDE Inhibition**",
                                "To determine the molecular basis of IDE inhibition and selectivity by these macrocycles, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of catalytically inactive cysteine-free human IDE-E111Q20 bound to 6b at 2.7 \u212b resolution (FIG. 2, Table 1). The enzyme adopted a closed conformation and its structure is essentially identical to that of apo-IDE (PDB 3QZ2, RMSD=0.257 \u212b). Macrocycle 6b occupies a binding pocket at the interface of IDE domains 1 and 2 (FIG. 2a), and is positioned more than 11 \u212b away from the zinc ion in the active site (FIGS. 2b and 2c). This distal binding site is a unique structural feature of IDE compared to related metalloproteases21, and does not overlap with the binding site of the substrate-mimetic inhibitor Ii112. The structure suggests that by engaging this distal site, the macrocycle competes with substrate binding (FIG. 9) and abrogates key interactions that are necessary to unfold peptide substrates for cleavage22-24 (FIG. 2d).",
                                "To test the relevance of this structural model of the macrocycle: IDE complex (FIG. 9) in solution, we identified IDE mutations predicted by the structural model to impede 6b binding (FIG. 2e), prepared the corresponding mutant IDE proteins, and measured their abilities to be inhibited by 6b and 6bK. In addition, we also synthesized 6b analogs designed to complement these mutations and rescue inhibitor potency (FIG. 10). Building block A (p-benzoyl-phenylalanine in 6b) occupies a 10 \u212b-deep pocket in the crystal structure (FIG. 2b), defined by residues Leu201, Gly205, Tyr302, Thr316, and Ala479. As predicted by the structural model, mutation of Ala479 to leucine decreased the potency of inhibitors 6b and 6bK more than 600-fold, consistent with a significant steric clash in the binding site between Leu479 and the distal benzoyl group in building block A (FIG. 2e). Replacement of the p-benzoyl-phenylalanine building block with the smaller tert-butyl-phenylalanine, macrocycle 9, inhibited A479L-IDE with equal potency as wild-type IDE, consistent with the ability of the smaller macrocycle 9 to accommodate the added bulk of the leucine side chain (FIG. 10). Likewise, building block B (cyclohexylalanine in 6b) makes contacts in the structure with the peptide backbone of residues Val360, Gly361, and Gly362 located on the lateral \u03b2-strand 13 of IDE domain 2. These residues are thought to assist in unfolding of large peptide substrates by promoting cross-\u03b2-sheet interactions22-24. Mutation of Gly362 to glutamine decreased the inhibition potencies of 6b and 6bK at least 50-fold compared to wild-type IDE (FIG. 2e). A modified macrocycle (13) in which the cyclohexylalanine building block was replaced with a smaller leucine residue inhibited G362Q IDE and wild-type IDE comparably, consistent with a model in which the smaller B building block complemented the larger size of the glutamine side chain (FIG. 10). Together, these structural and biochemical studies provide strong evidence for the proposed distal binding site of 6b and demonstrate the ability of the DNA-templated macrocycle library to provide inhibitors that achieve unusual selectivity by targeting residues beyond the catalytic site.",

                                "Next we characterized the stability, physicochemical, and pharmacokinetic properties of 6bK. This macrocycle was resistant to hydrolysis during incubations with plasma and liver microsome preparations (74% and 78% remaining after 1 h, respectively), suggesting that this compound may be sufficiently stable in vivo to inhibit IDE activity. Plasma protein binding assays indicated that \u02dc6% of 6bK remains unbound and potentially available to engage its target. To measure plasma half-life in vivo, we treated mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 80 mg/kg 6bK using a formulation of sterile saline and Captisol, a \u03b2-cyclodextrin-based agent used to improve solubilization and delivery25. Plasma and tissue concentrations of 6bK were measured using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) (FIG. 11). Plasma levels of 6bK were detectable 5 min post-injection, reached peak concentration (>100 \u03bcM) at 60 min, and were maintained at a detectable level for at least 4 h (FIG. 11). This circulation time is within the timescale for standard physiological experiments with live animals26,27. We observed prompt biodistribution of 6bK into plasma, liver, kidney, and pancreatic tissues (FIG. 11). We did not detect any6bK in the brain, suggesting that this macrocycle may not inhibit IDE within brain tissues, where IDE activity is needed for the clearance of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide10. Collectively, these observations suggested the viability of 6bK as a potential in vivo IDE inhibitor probe in peripheral tissues of mice14.",
                                "To evaluate the ability of 6bK to inhibit IDE activity in vivo, we subjected non-fasted mice to insulin tolerance tests (ITT)27 following a single injection with 6bK (80 mg/kg) formulated in Captisol25. The insulin injections were carried out 30 min post-injection, the time of highest 6bK concentration in plasma (approximately 100 \u03bcM, \u02dc1000-fold the IC50 for mouse IDE). Following a subcutaneous insulin injection, mice treated with 6bK experienced lower hypoglycemia and higher insulin levels compared to vehicle controls (p<0.01, FIG. 11; see also FIG. 4b). In 1955, Mirsky used a similar ITT assay to suggest the feasibility of insulin stabilization by injecting rats with preparations of an undefined endogenous IDE inhibitor crudely fractionated from bovine livers (presumably a competitive substrate; see Table 2)28.",
                                "Our experiments with 6bKprovide the first evidence that a well-defined, selective, and physiologically stable pharmacological IDE inhibitor can augment the abundance and activity of insulin in vivo. Testing the macrocycle at several doses established an effective dose of 6bK of \u02dc2 mg/mouse i.p., representing 80 mg/kg for lean C57BL/6J mice (25 g), and 60 mg/kg for diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (35-45 g). These inhibitor doses were well tolerated, did not produce adverse reactions, or body weight loss (FIG. 11), and did not induce detectable behavioral abnormalities.",

These four conditions were chosen to survey the role of IDE activity under a broad range of endogenous insulin levels and insulin sensitivity26,29. Oral glucose administration, for example, results in greater insulin secretion compared to injected glucose delivery (FIG. 12). Passage of glucose through the gut causes the release of GLP-1, which strongly augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion2,29. This phenomenon is referred to as the \u2018incretin effect\u2019 (FIG. 12) and is magnified in DIO mice29. In addition, DIO mice display hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance compared to lean mice, enabling us to test the consequences of IDE inhibition in a model that resembles early type-2 diabetes in humans30.",
                                "In all glucose tolerance experiments we included two control groups: vehicle alone, and the inactive isomer14 bisepi-6bK (FIG. 1c), which is identical to 6bK in chemical composition and bond connectivity, but has virtually no IDE inhibition activity (IC50>100 \u03bcM, FIG. 1c, see also Data FIG. 13). As expected, administration of 6bK alone, without a glucose challenge, did not significantly alter basal blood glucose or hormone levels compared to control treatments (FIG. 13). We then examined the effect of 6bK on blood glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Lean or DIO mice were fasted overnight for these experiments, and then treated with a single dose of 6bK, vehicle alone, or a matching dose of inactive bisepi-6bK. After 30 minutes, glucose was administered by oral gavage.",
                                "Importantly, both lean and DIO mice treated with 6bK displayed significantly improved oral glucose tolerance compared to vehicle or inactive bisepi-6bK control groups (FIG. 3 and FIG. 13). Effects of similar magnitude on oral glucose tolerance in mice have been observed using several known human anti-diabetic therapeutics31-34. The two control groups exhibited similar blood glucose profiles, indicating that the observed effects of 6bK on glucose tolerance are lost when the stereochemistry of 6bK is altered in a way that abolishes IDE inhibition.",
                                "These observations support a model in which IDE regulates glucose-induced insulin signaling, and therefore glucose tolerance, and demonstrate that acute IDE inhibition improves post-prandial glucose control in lean and DIO mice (FIGS. 3a and 3b). Together, these results represent the first time that IDE inhibition has been shown to improve blood glucose tolerance3,28.",

                                "Prior work using IDE\u2212/\u2212 mice characterized the effect of i.p. glucose injections, therefore we repeated the above experiments with 6bK followed by i.p. injected glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) to provide a more direct comparison with the knockout animal experiments10,11. In contrast to the observed improvement in oral glucose tolerance upon 6bK treatment (FIGS. 3a and 3b), IDE inhibition with 6bK followed by a glucose injection (1.5 g/kg i.p.) resulted in impaired glucose tolerance after 2 h in both lean and obese mice compared to vehicle alone or bisepi-6bK-treated controls (FIGS. 3c and 3d). These changes in the glucose response profiles of lean mice treated with 6bK compared to vehicle controls resemble the reported differences between IDE\u2212/\u2212 and IDE+/+ mice during similar IPGTTs10,11. Moreover, DIO mice treated with 6bK followed by glucose injection displayed a biphasic response in which glucose levels are lower over the initial 30 minutes of the IPGTT, followed by a hyperglycemic \u201crebound\u201d starting 1 h after glucose injection (FIG. 3d). Both the suppression of peak glucose levels and the magnitude of the hyperglycemic rebound were dependent on 6bK dose, and neither effect was observed in cohorts treated with vehicle alone or inactive bisepi-6bK, indicating that the impaired glucose tolerance during an IPGTT correlates with IDE activity (FIG. 3, and FIG. 13).",
                                "Collectively, the results of the OGTTs and IPGTTs indicate that the route of glucose administration impacts the physiological response of 6bK-treated animals in ways that cannot be explained by a simple model in which IDE's physiological role is only to degrade insulin. Instead, the IPGTT results strongly suggest a role for IDE in regulating other glucose-regulating peptide hormones in vivo (Table 2).",

Two glucose-regulating hormones, beyond insulin, that are potential candidates for physiological regulation by IDE during a glucose challenge are glucagon and amylin. Purified IDE has been previously shown to cleave both peptides in vitro35-37, but neither hormone is known to be regulated by IDE activity in vivo. Compared to insulin, glucagon is a modest in vitro IDE substrate (KM=3.5 \u03bcM for glucagon versus KM<30 nM for insulin)35, although IDE is capable of degrading glucagon at a comparable rate if present in sufficiently high concentrations (kcat=38 min\u22121 for glucagon)36. Amylin is also a substrate for IDE in vitro (KM=\u02dc0.3 \u03bcM)37. Other proteases suggested to degrade glucagon include nardilysin, cathepsin B and D, in cells and in vitro38,39, and neprilysin, which was shown to play a role in renal clearance of glucagon40. However, none of these enzymes are known to regulate endogenous processing of hormones or modulate blood glucose levels. To our knowledge, no proteases have been previously shown to degrade amylin in vivo37.",
                                "To begin to probe the possibility that glucagon or amylin is regulated in vivo by IDE, we measured the plasma levels of these hormones at 20 and 130 minutes post-glucose injection in DIO mice treated with 6bK or vehicle alone during an IPGTT (FIG. 4a). Plasma collected 20 minutes post-glucose injection showed elevated insulin and amylin levels, but unchanged glucagon levels, for the 6bK-treated cohort relative to the control group (FIG. 4a). During the hyperglycemic rebound 130 min post-injection, glucagon levels for the 6bK group were strongly elevated above 200 pg/mL, compared with 90 pg/mL glucagon in control mice (FIG. 4a). Consistent with these elevated glucagon levels, expression of a gluconeogenesis transcriptional marker, G6Pase, was elevated in the livers of 6bK-treated mice compared to control mice (FIG. 4a).",
                                "Because hormone abundance measurements can be difficult to interpret during fluctuations in blood glucose that in turn affect pancreatic hormone secretion, we performed additional studies to confirm the relationship between IDE activity and glucagon and amylin levels in vivo. To more directly establish the effect of IDE inhibition on the clearance of insulin, amylin, and glucagon in vivo, we injected each of these three hormones into lean mice 30 min after treatment with 6bK or vehicle alone (FIGS. 4b to 4d). The 6bK-treated cohorts exhibited significantly stronger blood glucose responses to each of these hormones compared to vehicle controls; mice treated with 6bK experienced hypoglycemia during insulin tolerance tests (FIG. 4b) and hyperglycemia following challenges with either amylin (FIG. 4c) or glucagon (FIG. 4d) relative to control animals. Similar to glucagon, acute amylin administration in rodents results in a transient increase in blood glucose levels through gluconeogenesis and activation of lactic acid flux from muscle tissue to the liver41. Moreover, in each case the plasma level of the hormone injected remained elevated at the end of the procedure in 6bK-treated mice relative to control animals, demonstrating a role for IDE in regulating the abundance of these hormones (FIGS. 4b to 4d insets).",

                                "Taken together, these results strongly suggest that IDE activity regulates the stability and physiological activities of glucagon and amylin, in addition to insulin. Higher glucagon levels upon 6bK treatment provide a possible explanation for impaired glucose tolerance observed during an IPGTT. This model predicts that abrogating glucagon signaling should reverse the elevation of blood glucose by 6bK treatment during an IPGTT, while not substantially affecting the signaling pathways through which 6bK treatment lowers blood glucose during an OGTT.",
                                "To explicitly test these hypotheses, we repeated the glucose tolerance experiments using GCGR\u2212/\u2212 mice that lack the G-protein coupled glucagon receptor (FIGS. 5a and 5b)42. As expected, mice lacking glucagon signaling exhibited an improvement in oral glucose tolerance upon 6bK treatment relative to vehicle controls that was similar to the oral glucose tolerance improvement observed in wild-type mice (FIG. 5a), consistent with a model in which insulin signaling in these mice is intact and regulated by IDE. In contrast, the responses of GCGR\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with 6bK or vehicle alone to i.p. injected glucose were virtually identical, consistent with a model in which glucagon signaling drives the impaired glucose tolerance of wild-type lean and DIO mice upon 6bK treatment during an IPGTT (compare FIGS. 5b and 3c). Collectively, these results reveal that IDE inhibition promotes glucagon signaling that can impair glucose tolerance during an IPGTT.",
                                "To investigate the effect of IDE inhibition on endogenously secreted glucagon, we subjected mice treated with 6bK, vehicle, or inactive bisepi-6bK to a pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), which measures the ability of the liver under the action of glucagon to use pyruvate as a gluconeogenic substrate (FIG. 5c). The 6bK-treated cohort displayed significantly elevated plasma glucagon and increased expression of liver gluconeogenic markers compared to both control groups (FIGS. 5d and 5e). The 6bK cohort also experienced significantly lower blood glucose during the PTT, suggesting that IDE inhibition produced a concomitant stimulation of glucose clearance that outweighed its effects on gluconeogenesis (FIG. 5c). These results collectively establish that IDE inhibition can augment endogenous glucagon signaling under conditions that favor gluconeogenesis.",

Pramlintide (Smylin) is a synthetic amylin derivative used clinically to control post-prandial glucose levels31,34,46. To determine the effects of IDE inhibition on endogenous amylin signaling, we measured gastric emptying efficiency47, an amylin-specific process, in mice treated with 6bK, inactive control bisepi-6bK, or vehicle alone. Mice treated with 6bK exhibited 2-fold slower gastric emptying of a labeled glucose solution measured at 30 minutes post-gavage compared to vehicle and bisepi-6K-treated controls (FIG. 5f). Importantly, co-administration of the specific amylin receptor antagonist AC18748 blocked the effects of 6bxzK on gastric emptying (FIG. 5f). Collectively, these data reveal that IDE inhibition can slow post-prandial gastric emptying and demonstrate a role for IDE in modulating amylin signaling in vivo. These results also suggest that IDE inhibition may mimic the effect of amylin supplementation with pramlintide during meals2,31.",

These results validate the potential of IDE as a therapeutic target following decades of speculation3,4. Our data show that small-molecule IDE inhibitors can improve oral glucose tolerance to an extent comparable to that of DPP4 inhibitors2,31. The potential relevance of these animal studies to human disease is supported by the repeated recognition of IDE as a diabetes susceptibility gene in humans5-9.",
                                "Equally important, additional in vivo and biochemical experiments using 6bK led to the discovery that IDE regulates the stability and signaling of glucagon and amylin, in addition to its established role in insulin degradation10-12. The identification of two additional pancreatic hormones as endogenous IDE substrates advances our understanding of the role of IDE in regulating physiological glucose homeostasis (FIG. 6). Amylin-mediated effects on gastric emptying and satiety during meals have been recently recognized to have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of diabetes2,31, and our results represent the first demonstration of a small molecule that can regulate amylin signaling. Moreover, the link between IDE and glucagon provides additional evidence of the importance of glucagon regulation in human diabetes49.",

A potential anti-diabetic therapeutic strategy motivated by these findings is the development of a fast-acting IDE inhibitor that can be taken with a meal to transiently augment endogenous insulin and amylin responses to help control post-prandial glycemia31-32, and that is cleared or degraded before glucagon secretion resumes. Similar pre-meal therapeutic strategies with short-lived agents have already proven successful with fast-acting insulin analogs, secretagogues, and amylin supplementation32-33. It is tempting to speculate these agents may also have synergistic effects when co-administered with an IDE inhibitor3,50. Alternatively, the combination of an IDE inhibitor with incretin therapy2,31 or a glucagon receptor antagonist49, may also prove therapeutic, as suggested by our experiments with glucagon-receptor deficient mice.",

                                "In order to determine whether IDE inhibitors modulate blood pressure, the effect of 6bk in a mouse Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) model was evaluated. CGRP is a potent microvascular vasodilator widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems of vertebrates. Administration of CGRP resulting in supraphysiological plasma levels of CGRP results in temporary vasodilation, hypotension, and an increased heart rate. This effect has been demonstrated after intravenous administration of CGRP in various vertebrate species, including humans.",
                                "CGRP-induced hypotension is dose-dependent, as illustrated in FIG. 16, showing data from a single mouse injected with different doses (0.5 \u03bcg, 1 \u03bcg, and 3 \u03bcg) of CGRP. Blood pressure was measured over a time of 20 minutes after administration of CGRP. A dose-dependent, temporary induction of hypertension by CGRP was observed.",
                                "FIG. 17 illustrates representative blood pressure data obtained after administration of 0.25 \u03bcg CGRP alone or in combination with 6bK. Blood pressure was monitored for 30 minutes after administration of CGRP.",
                                "FIG. 18 illustrates that 6bK affects blood pressure baseline and increases CGRP response duration. Nine mice received 250 ng CGRP intravenously (t=0). Four of these mice received 1 mg of 6bK intraperitoneally 30 minutes before CGRP administration. The other five received a control injection of vehicle only. The upper panel of FIG. 18 demonstrates that baseline blood pressure was reduced in 6bK-administered mice as compared to mice that received a control injection of vehicle only. In addition, 6bK attenuated return of blood pressure to baseline levels after CGRP administration. The lower panel of FIG. 18 shows that while the initial decrease in blood pressure levels followed similar kinetics in both 6bK-administered and control mice, the return to baseline followed slower kinetics in 6bK-administered mice as compared to control mice.",
                                "To test whether 6bK affects baseline heart rate and heart rate changes induced by CGRP administration, four mice were injected with 1 mg 6bK 30 min before intravenous administration0 of 250 ng CGRP (t=0). The upper panel of FIG. 19 demonstrates that the baseline heart rate was reduced in 6bK-administered mice as compared to control mice. In addition,the lower panel of FIG. 19 demonstates that the increase in heart rate observed initially after CGRP administration is similar in both groups, but that the heart rate remains lower and the heart change rate is decreased in 6bK-administered mice as compared to controls.",
                                "Supraphysiological doses of CGRP induce blood glucose fluctuations via amylin receptors. In order to test whether 6bK modulates these CGRP-induced blood glucoe excursions, C57BL/6J lean mice were injected with either 80 mg/kg 6bK or with vehicle alone 30 min before administration of CGRP. Blood glucose was monitored at various points throughout the experiment, beginning at 45 minutes before and ending at 110 minutes after CGRP administration. The data was plotted (left panel) and the area under the curve for the 6bK-administered mice and the control mice was integrated. Blood was obtained 45 minutes after 6bK administration and plasma CGRP levels were measured. FIG. 20 demonstrates that 6bK augments CGRP-induced blood glucose excursions.",
                                "The data indicate that 6bK increases the duration of CGRP-induced hypotension, suggesting that IDE enzymatic processing determines the physiological activity of CGRP in vivo, and might be applicable to pharmacological modulation of the endogenous vasodilator. The observed effect of 6bK on hypotension is corroborated by the observed 6bK augmentation of CGRP-induced blood glucose level fluctuations. In addition, 6bK treatment also lowered baseline blood pressure 10 to 15 min post-injection."
