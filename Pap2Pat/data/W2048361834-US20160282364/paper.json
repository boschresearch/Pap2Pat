    "title": "Anti-diabetic activity of insulin-degrading enzyme inhibitors mediated by multiple hormones",
    "date": "2014-05-21",
    "abstract": "Despite decades of speculation that inhibiting endogenous insulin degradation might treat type-2 diabetes, and the identification of IDE (insulin-degrading enzyme) as a diabetes susceptibility gene, the relationship between the activity of the zinc metalloprotein IDE and glucose homeostasis remains unclear. Although Ide(-/-) mice have elevated insulin levels, they exhibit impaired, rather than improved, glucose tolerance that may arise from compensatory insulin signalling dysfunction. IDE inhibitors that are active in vivo are therefore needed to elucidate IDE's physiological roles and to determine its potential to serve as a target for the treatment of diabetes. Here we report the discovery of a physiologically active IDE inhibitor identified from a DNA-templated macrocycle library. An X-ray structure of the macrocycle bound to IDE reveals that it engages a binding pocket away from the catalytic site, which explains its remarkable selectivity. Treatment of lean and obese mice with this inhibitor shows that IDE regulates the abundance and signalling of glucagon and amylin, in addition to that of insulin. Under physiological conditions that augment insulin and amylin levels, such as oral glucose administration, acute IDE inhibition leads to substantially improved glucose tolerance and slower gastric emptying. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of modulating IDE activity as a new therapeutic strategy to treat type-2 diabetes and expand our understanding of the roles of IDE in glucose and hormone regulation.",

                "The in vitro selection of the DNA-templated library 8 used 20 \u00b5g His 6 -tagged mouse IDE immobilized on cobalt magnetic beads (Invitrogen). IDE inhibition was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide Mca-RPPGFSAFK(Dnp)-OH (R&D), confirmed using an anti-insulin antibody time-resolved FRET assay (Cysbio), and a LCMS assay for CGRP cleavage fragments in plasma 9 . Macrocyclic inhibitors were synthesized by Fmoc-based solid-phase synthesis and purified by HPLC. LCMS quantitation of 6bK in biological samples was performed using 6bK synthesized with 13 C 6 , 15 N 2 lysine (Sigma-Aldrich).",
                "Wild-type lean and DIO C57BL/6J age-matched male mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used at 14-16, and 24-26 weeks respectively (> 20 weeks of high-fat diet). Gcgr -/-and Ide -/-mice were fully backcrossed to the C57BL/6J line, bred from heterozygous mice, and used between 11 and 21 weeks. Animals were fasted overnight 14 h for all experiments, except for the insulin tolerance test, which required 5 h of fasting during the morning. Blood glucose was measured from tail nicks using AccuCheck (Aviva) meters. Trunk blood was obtained for plasma hormone measurements using the Multiplexed Mouse Metabolic Hormone panel (Milliplex, EMD Millipore) on a Luminex FlexMap 3D instrument."
