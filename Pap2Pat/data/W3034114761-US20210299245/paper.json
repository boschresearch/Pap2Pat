    "title": "The vaccinia virus based Sementis Copenhagen Vector vaccine against Zika and chikungunya is immunogenic in non-human primates",
    "date": "2020-06-02",
    "abstract": "The Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV) is a new vaccinia virus-derived, multiplication-defective, vaccine technology assessed herein in non-human primates. Indian rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) were vaccinated with a multi-pathogen recombinant SCV vaccine encoding the structural polyproteins of both Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). After one vaccination, neutralising antibody responses to ZIKV and four strains of CHIKV, representative of distinct viral genotypes, were generated. A second vaccination resulted in significant boosting of neutralising antibody responses to ZIKV and CHIKV. Following challenge with ZIKV, SCV-ZIKA/CHIK-vaccinated animals showed significant reductions in viremias compared with animals that had received a control SCV vaccine. Two SCV vaccinations also generated neutralising and IgG ELISA antibody responses to vaccinia virus. These results demonstrate effective induction of immunity in non-human primates by a recombinant SCV vaccine and illustrates the utility of SCV as a multi-disease vaccine platform capable of delivering multiple large immunogens.",

                "Poxvirus-based vaccine vector systems have a number of attractive features including (i) the ability to accommodate large recombinant immunogen payloads (at least 25,000 base pairs), (ii) a capacity for cold chain-independent distribution, (iii) the lack of DNA integration and (iv) the potential for needle-free vaccine delivery (reviewed in ref. 1). A range of vaccine vector systems based on vaccinia virus (VACV) and other poxviruses have been developed, with several sold as products and many more in human clinical trials1,2. These include NYVAC3, ALVAC4, fowlpox5 and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)6, with a large series of recombinant MVA (rMVA) vaccines evaluated in non-human primate (NHP) studies2,7 and in human clinical trials1,8. In humans and NHPs, rMVA vaccines are generally effective at boosting immune responses, but are often poor as stand-alone vaccines for induction of effective immune responses to recombinant vaccine antigens in naive individuals. Heterologous prime-boost strategies (e.g., DNA prime and rMVA boost) have been widely adopted to overcome this limitation1,7,9,10. MVA was rendered replication defective in mammalian cells by 572 passages of VACV in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and, towards the end of the global smallpox, vaccination campaign was used in \u2248120,000 people with no significant side effects. MVA is currently sold as a smallpox vaccine as IMVANEX/IMVAMUNE (by Bavarian Nordic)8,11. Manufacture of rMVA/MVA vaccines has relied on the use of CEFs, although EB66, a duck embryo-derived cell line, may be used in the future12. The other aforementioned poxvirus vectors similarly use CEFs for production.",
                "The Sementis Copenhagen Vector (SCV) represents a new vaccine vector technology based on the Copenhagen strain of VACV. SCV is unable to generate infectious viral progeny in vaccine recipients due to a targeted deletion of D13L, a gene encoding the essential viral assembly protein, D13. Recombinant SCV vaccines are produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells modified to express D13 and the host range protein CP77. CHO cells are widely used in the manufacture of biologics and provide a significant advantage over CEFs that have traditionally been used for the manufacture of VACV-based vaccines1,13,14. A single-construct, multi-pathogen SCV vaccine encoding the structural gene cassettes of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (SCV-ZIKA/CHIK) was recently shown to be immunogenic and protective against both viruses in a series of mouse challenge models after a single vaccination14. An SCV vaccine was also shown to protect against ectromelia virus (a mouse model of smallpox) and to be non-pathogenic in SCID mice (a mouse model of lethal progressive VACV infection)13.",
                "The largest outbreak of CHIKV ever recorded started in 2004 and reached >100 countries in four continents, with >10 million cases of primarily rheumatic disease, with mortality rate estimates ranging from 0.024 to 0.7% of CHIKV cases15. In 2016, the World Health Organization declared the ZIKV pandemic a public health emergency of international concern. ZIKV is the aetiological agent of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), a spectrum of primarily neurological abnormalities (including microcephaly) in newborns arising from ZIKV infection of pregnant mothers, with >4300 CZS cases reported in Brazil in 201616. A considerable international effort has been underway to develop vaccines against both CHIKV17 and ZIKV18. A combination ZIKV and CHIKV vaccine is deemed attractive as these two arboviruses (i) co-circulate in many parts of the world19, (ii) can be transmitted by the same mosquito vectors and (iii) can co-infect both humans20 and mosquitoes21. Single-construct multi-pathogen vaccines such as the SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccine14 (and the recently described vesicular stomatitis virus ZIKV/CHIKV vaccine22) provide simplified manufacturing and formulation23, with multi-pathogen vaccines generally providing reduced \u2018shot burden\u2019, increased compliance and reduced costs1,24.",
                "Herein we describe the evaluation of a SCV vaccine in NHPs (Indian rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta) and show that SCV-ZIKA/CHIK induces antibody responses to CHIKV, ZIKA and VACV, and provides protection against ZIKV challenge."

Animals were vaccinated via an intramuscular injection into the right quadriceps (single site) in a volume of 0.5\u2009ml. No fever or loss of body weight was observed post-vaccination (Supplementary Table 1). No adverse events were noted, except for NHP 5548, who developed a rash by day 35 in the inguinal area, extending from the lower abdomen to the upper thighs. The rash failed to resolve throughout the study and was bilateral, moderately red, flat and similar to those sometimes seen in naive NHPs. When NHPs sit on perches with their legs drawn into their bodies for long periods, moisture and reduced airflow to these areas are likely contributors. This event was thus unlikely to have been related to vaccination, although a rash is an uncommon (\u22651/1000 to <1/100) adverse reaction after vaccination of humans with IMVANEX (MVA)25.Fig. 1Post-vaccination anti-ZIKV-neutralising antibody responses and ZIKV challenge.a Timeline of vaccination, bleeding and challenge. b FRNT50 titres (green) and serum ZIKV RNA copies/ml (blue) for each NHP at the indicated times after a single vaccination with 107\u2009pfu of SCV-ZIKA/CHIK, with a mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM graph shown at the far right.

Two NHPs in the SCV-ZIKA/CHIK 107\u2009pfu vaccine group showed serum ZIKV RNA copy numbers above the lower limit of reliable quantification (LLoRQ) determined to be 860 ZIKV RNA copies/ml, indicating that these animals had low level viremias. These animals were NHP 5552 that exceeded the LLoRQ for 3 days and NHP 5550 that exceeded the LLoRQ for 1 day (Supplementary Fig. 2).

An Indian Ocean sub-lineage (IOL) arose from the ECSA lineage during the Indian Ocean outbreak. Asian genotype viruses (introduced into the Caribbean in 2013) were responsible for most of the disease in the Americas, with the American viruses forming a sub-lineage within the Asian genotype30. (ECSA genotype viruses were recently identified in the Americas31). The NHP sera were thus analysed for their ability to neutralise four representative CHIKV isolates (i) LR2006-OPY1, a 2006 IOL isolate from Reunion Island (GenBank: DQ443544; resequenced KT449801.1), (ii) 37997, a 1983 WA isolate from Senegal (GenBank: AY726732.1), (iii) R99659, a contemporary 2014 Asian genotype virus from the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean (GenBank: KX713902.1/KJ451624.1) and (iv) AF15561, a 1962 Asian genotype isolate from Thailand (GenBank: EF452493.1).

Between days 35 and 70, the responses to the Asian isolates increased significantly by a mean of 5.2-fold (p\u2009=\u20090.009) (Fig. 3d, Asian), whereas the responses to the IOL and WA isolates did not change significantly (Fig. 3d, IOL and WA). Similarly, for the 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009pfu group, neutralising antibody responses to the Asian isolates were a mean of 30-fold lower than the IOL and WA isolates on day 35 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but on day 70 they were not significantly different (Fig. 3e, Day 35 vs. 70).

                "We show herein that SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccination was able to reduce post-challenge serum ZIKV RNA copy numbers to levels below those that can reliably be detected, except in two NHPs that received one dose of 107\u2009pfu SCV-ZIKA/CHIK (NHPs 5552 and 5550). Sterilising immunity (nominally defined as no viral RNA detected) was not achieved for any NHP, even those vaccinated with the positive control vaccine26 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Whether sterilising immunity is required to prevent transplacental fetal brain infection in pregnant women remains unclear. Whether low levels of placental or fetal infection could give rise to neonatal disabilities, or disabilities that might manifest later in life, remains similarly unclear35. The highly sensitive nature of qRT-PCR would make such sterilising immunity difficult to achieve, with very high levels of neutralising antibodies likely required36. Attaining and sustaining such high levels in women of child-bearing age would represent a considerable challenge, especially given the additional safety concerns in this population. A consensus view will have to await vaccine studies in pregnant NHPs, with the a hope being that a vaccine that is able to reduce substantially ZIKV replication will largely prevent or significantly ameliorate the rate and severity of CZS. Such a hope is supported by the success of vaccination campaigns against rubella37 (family Matonaviridae, genus Rubivirus) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Pestivirus)38.",
                "A concern for ZIKV vaccines is that they may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV)39, although no good evidence for such activity, or for ADE of ZIKV via prior DENV infection40, has emerged from studies of natural infections in humans41. Nevertheless, a poorly designed vaccine may (even if natural infections do not) provide opportunities for ADE. Conceivably, given recent insights, regulators may require mutation of the fusion loop region39 and/or the prM cleavage site42 to obviate the risk of ADE. Such modifications could be readily incorporated into recombinant vaccines such as SCV-ZIKA/CHIK, but might be less straightforward for live attenuated or inactivated whole-virus ZIKV vaccines (where viral replication is required in the vaccine recipient or during manufacture). The assay systems illustrating the absence of ADE that would satisfy regulators remain unclear, with in vitro assays perhaps now viewed as less reliable41, given inter alia the widespread ability to show ADE in vitro for a range of different viral genera43. We have established an IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model that shows ADE of DENV disease and were able to show that SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccination did not enhance DENV disease in this model (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although encouraging, the requirements for ZIKV vaccines in this space will have to await vaccine studies in pregnant NHPs and the development of consensus views by regulators.",
                "Although all CHIKV strains are thought to belong to the same serogroup44, differences in cross neutralisation between isolates from different genotypes have been reported45. The data presented herein suggests increased time post-vaccination increases the cross-neutralising capacity against multiple CHIKV genotypes. Although many neutralising responses are directed at tertiary or quaternary structures46,47, a linear epitope (E2EP3) at the N terminus of the E2 protein was identified as the target of many early neutralising responses in CHIKV-infected patients and NHPs32. The sequence of this epitope is identical in the CHIKV strain encoded by the SCV vaccine (IOL CHIKV isolate 06\u2013021), the IOL isolate (LR2006-OPY1) and the WA isolate (37997), whereas it has 1 or 2 non-conservative substitutions in the Asian isolates (R99659 and AF15561) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Antibody responses present later in CHIKV infections were found to be less focused on this epitope32, suggesting a level of epitope spreading over time. Early E2EP3-focused responses may explain why on day 35 SCV-ZIKA/CHIK induced higher neutralising responses to the IOL and WA isolates (conserved E2EP3 sequences). Later (day 70), epitope spreading may ensure similar levels of cross-neutralising responses to all the genotypes (Fig. 3a, b Mean). Similar broadening of responses has been shown to be promoted by adjuvanting of influenza vaccines48,49. The development of broadly neutralising antibodies over several years has also been reported in HIV patients50. The data presented herein is a clear illustration of time-dependence for the post-vaccination development of broadly neutralising responses against different CHIKV genotypes.",
                "Precisely, what level of neutralising antibody response is needed to protect against CHIKV is not entirely clear, although a conservative correlate of protection was defined as a reciprocal 50% neutralising serum antibody titre of a \u226510 in a phase 3 trial of a vaccine against the related Ross River virus51. In a rapidly lethal interferon signalling-deficient A129 mouse model, a minimum reciprocal 50% neutralising antibody titre of 35 conferred complete protection against CHIKV challenge52. After a single vaccination of NHPs herein with 107\u2009pfu of SCV-ZIKA/CHIK, the mean day 70 reciprocal FRNT50 anti-CHIKV titre was 59.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM 8.9 (range 28\u201393) (n\u2009=\u200920; 5 NHPs and 4 CHIKV strains). After two vaccinations with 108\u2009pfu, this value was 736\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM 187 (range 90\u20133090). SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccination thus induced neutralising antibody responses to CHIKV that might be expected to provide protection against CHIKV challenge.",
                "The mean SCV-induced anti-VACV reciprocal PRNT50 neutralisation titre of 79\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM 24 after 2 vaccinations i.m. with 108\u2009pfu of SCV vaccines compares favourably with phase III human trial data (i) where MVA vaccination resulted in a mean reciprocal PRNT50 neutralisation titre of 94 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 78\u2013113) (n\u2009=\u2009189\u2013220) on day 84 after 2 subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccinations (given weeks 0 and 4) with 108 TCID50 of MVA and (ii) where vaccination with the live VACV vaccine, ACAM2000, produced a mean reciprocal PRNT50 neutralisation titre of 65.6 (95% CI 54\u201379) (n\u2009=\u2009189\u2013220) on day 56 after one vaccination by killing8. Although assay systems might differ, both herein and in the study by Pittman et al.8, the Western Reserve strain of VACV was used for the antibody assays. The immune correlates of protection against smallpox are not well characterised, with both CD8 T cells and neutralising antibodies thought to play a role53. Smallpox (and VACV) exists in two forms: intracellular mature virions (MVs) with one envelope and extracellular enveloped viruses that have an additional envelope. Antibodies directed at both virion forms are believed to be required for optimal protection54,55; however, the VACV used for neutralisation assays usually comprises primarily MVs. The results in Fig. 4 thus suggest that SCV may find utility as a smallpox vaccine; however, NHP challenge studies using monkeypox virus are needed to support this contention.",
                "A number of limitations of this study are recognised. The limited available budget precluded a more extensive dose ranging and scheduling series for the SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccine, with only one arguably low end (one vaccination with 107) and one high end (two vaccination with 108\u2009pfu) dosing/scheduling tested. In addition, although poxvirus vaccine systems generally show considerable utility for induction of T-cell responses1, these were not accessed in this study, with both CD4 and CD8 T cells likely mediating protection against ZIKV28,29. No CHIKV challenge was undertaken due to the high costs associated with NHP studies under BSL3 conditions; furthermore, NHP models are currently also unable to provide arthralgia or overt arthritis readouts56,57. Nevertheless, CHIKV neutralising antibody titres were reached that might be expected to provide protection from vireamia and athropathy. We were also unable to gain access to any Brazilian ECSA isolates58 for use in this industry-supported project; however, such isolates show lower levels of divergence from the vaccine strain than the Asian isolates (to which neutralising response were generated).",
                "In summary, the results of this NHP study of the SCV technology support the view that SCV-ZIKA/CHIK vaccination can induce immunity in NHPs that is sufficient for protection against ZIKV and CHIKV. Perhaps most encouraging was the ability of a single vaccination and a homologous prime-boost to induce significant anti-ZIKV and anti-CHIKV-neutralising antibody responses in NHPs, potentially obviating the need for heterologous prime-boost strategies for recombinant SCV vaccines."
