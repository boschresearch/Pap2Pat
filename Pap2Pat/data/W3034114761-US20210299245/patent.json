                        "The poxvirus family comprises two subfamilies, the Chordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae. The Chordopoxvirinae comprises eight genera including the Orthopoxviridae comprising species which infect man (for example, variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, cowpox virus (which formed the original smallpox vaccine reported by Jenner in 1796), vaccinia virus (used as a second-generation smallpox vaccine) and monkeypox virus), and the Avipoxviridae viruses comprising species that infect birds, such as fowlpox and canarypox viruses. In addition to their use as antigens in smallpox vaccines, there is much interest in the use of recombinant vaccinia-based viruses and avipox viruses as \u201cbackbone\u201d vectors. As intra-cytoplasmic vectors, the Othopoxviridae are able inter alia to induce production of foreign antigens in the host cytoplasm for recognition by the host immune system. Such vectors expressing foreign antigens are intensively researched in the development of vaccines for diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and cancer which have proven difficult to treat by other vaccination strategies.",
                        "The Chordopoxvirinae have linear double-stranded DNA genomes ranging in size from 130 kb in parapoxviruses to over 300 kb in avipoxviruses and their life cycle in the host is spent entirely in the host cell cytoplasm. The poxviruses operate mostly independently of their host cell and host cell molecules, especially for processes involved in early mRNA synthesis. However, host molecules appear to be used for the initiation or termination of intermediate and late viral transcription. The poxviruses produce structurally diverse \u201chost range factors\u201d which specifically target and manipulate host signaling pathways to permit cellular conditions allowing viral replication. Most poxviruses can bind and infect mammalian cells, but whether or not the subsequent infection is permissive (able to produce infectious virions) or non-permissive (substantially unable to produce infections virions) is dependent upon the specific poxvirus and specific cell type involved. For a review of host range genes, refer to Werden et al. 2008 incorporated herein in its entirety.",
                        "Strains of vaccinia relevant to their use as smallpox vaccines and subsequently as viral vectors, have been published from the early 1960's through to the present day. Certain strains of vaccinia, including strains employed as smallpox vaccines, are able to propagate in human cells and therefore represent health risks, such as the development of viral encephalitis. With a view to developing a safer vaccine, a vaccinia strain from Ankara (referred to as \u201cCVA\u201d) was passaged more than 500 times in non-human cells. During this process, the vaccinia genome changed substantially involving the development of at least six major deletions compared to the original CVA genome. The modified virus was less pathogenic, due to replication deficiencies in mammalian cells, but still able to engender a protective immune response. This attenuated vaccinia virus is referred to as MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) and is also categorized by passage number, as viruses with different passage numbers were found to be genetically and phenotypically distinct. However, by passage number 515, MVA515, was determined to be genetically stable. In the early 1990s, it was observed that MVA strains, such as MVA572, and its derivative, MVA F8 were able to express vaccinia proteins and heterologous (recombinant) proteins at high levels in non-permissive cells (in which the virus will not propagate), enabling the development of MVA as a vector for heterologous molecules of interest, such as those encoding antigens for vaccine or therapy delivery. MVA is the most studied among the poxviral vaccine vector systems but other poxviruses have been developed to function in a similar way such as NYVAC, ALVAC, and fowlpox.",
                        "Another vaccinia virus, which is developed by Sementis Ltd, is the so-called SCV (Sementis Copenhagen Vaccinia) vaccinia virus vector. The SCV has been generated using the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia and engineered by deletion of D13L, which encodes an essential viral assembly protein, thereby rendering SCV unable to replicate and produce infectious progeny. Genome amplification is preserved in SCV-infected cells, thus permitting late-phase expression of vaccine antigens and a generation of a strong immune response against the inserted antigens. SCV possesses a number of advantages compared to MVA in that it possesses the immunogenicity of replication competent vaccinia and is unable to replicate in mammalian cells tested. The SCV platform has two key points of difference from the MVA platform, namely (i) it has been specifically engineered to be replication-deficient through the targeted deletion of the D131 gene, thus safer, whilst maintaining potency with single-shot efficacy and (ii) it is also designed to be manufactured in a standard and scalable commercial cell-line.",
                        "Coronaviruses are RNA viruses consisting of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 27-32 kilobases. As the name indicates, the spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape when observed under an electron microscope. The virus is known to infect a wide range of hosts, including humans. Infected hosts exhibit different clinical courses ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms. Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which are divided into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Gamma-coronaviruses. CoVs are commonly found in many species of animals, including bats, camels, and humans. Occasionally, the animal CoVs can acquire genetic mutations by errors during genome replication or recombination mechanisms, which can further expand their tropism to humans. The first human CoVs were discovered in the mid-1960s. A total of seven human CoV types were identified to be responsible for causing human respiratory ailments, which include two alpha CoVe and five beta CoVs. Typically, these CoVs can cause a range of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms such as gastroentertis and neurological diseases of varying severity have also been reported.",
                        "Coronaviruses contain a canonical set of four major structural proteins: Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The virion possesses a nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and the phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein. The nucleocapsid is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by spike (S) proteins. The membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the viral envelope.",
                        "The spike protein is composed of a transmembrane trimetric glycoprotein protruding from the viral surface, which determines the diversity of coronaviruses and host tropism. Spike comprises two functional subunits; S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and S2 subunit for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.",
                        "Coronavirus particles consist of a helical nucleocapsid structure, formed by the interaction of the nucleocapsid phosphoproteins and the viral genomic RNA, which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer where the structural proteins are inserted. The triple-spanning membrane glycoprotein M drives the assembly of coronaviruses, which bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediary compartment (ERGIC). Membrane protein is the most abundant viral protein that sorts viral components to be incorporated into virions. Membrane oligomerization allows the formation of a lattice of membrane proteins at the ERGIC membranes. Spike and envelope proteins are integrated into the lattice through lateral interactions with membrane protein, whereas nucleocapsid and viral RNA interact with the membrane C-terminal domain, which is exposed to the cytosol. The envelope protein is a viroporin that forms ion channels and plays an important role in virus morphogenesis and budding, however this process is not fully understood to date. Studies on SARS-CoV have demonstrated that depletion of the envelope gene from coronavirus genome strongly diminish virus growth and particle formation. The nucleocapsid protein self-associates and encapsidates the RNA genome for incorporation within the virion.",
                        "Human coronaviruses are one of the main pathogens causing respiratory infection. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans and four other human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoVHKU1) induce mild upper respiratory disease. The SARS-CoV caused a major outbreak involving 8422 patients during 2002-03 and spread to 29 countries globally. The epidemic was contained in July 2003 as the transmission chain of SARS-CoV in Taiwan was interrupted and no more human cases have been reported since May 2004. MERS-CoV emerged in Middle Eastern countries in 2012 and has been causing persistent endemics in countries within and sporadically spreading to countries outside the Middle East regions. In late 2019, the first reports of an unknown respiratory infection emerged from Wuhan, China. The infection source was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by this virus named COVID-19. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on Mar. 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has an infection fatality rate ranging from 0.16% to 1.60% and by mid-February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 108.2 million people and caused 2.3 million deaths globally. SARS-CoV-2 has forced much of the world to adopt a lockdown practice which has resulted in staggering economic fallout and human suffering.",
                        "SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive sense RNA virus that is included in the Orhocoronavidnae subfamily which is broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. As part of the sarbecovirus genus, its diameter is about 65 to 125 nm and contains single stranded RNA, with dub-shaped glycoprotein spikes on the outer surface giving the virus a crown-like or coronal appearance. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel \u03b2-coronavirus after the previously identified SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which led to pulmonary failure and potentially fatal respiratory tract infection. The reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2, which describes the capability of transmission per primary infected person to the secondarily infected persons, is estimated to range between 1.4 to 2.5 by the WHO. However meta-analysis of global studies estimate the reproductive number closer to 2.87. The reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is considerably higher than the previous infectious coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS respectively (0.95 and 0.91). The possible reasons for the higher reproductive number may be the inherent biological features to this virus strain. For instance, a person could be infected by numerous ways, such as close physical contact with the infected person, through environmental transmission by respiratory droplets, fomites, and airborne transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may not show symptomatic characteristics up to two weeks of infection which may increase the risk of new infections exponentially as the infected person is usually confounded in the community with other people during the asymptomatic stage. Phylogenetic analysis from nine patients' samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003. Sequences from different patients were almost identical with greater than 99.9% sequence identity suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a single source within a very short period. Currently available data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infected the human population from a bat reservoir and that SARS-CoV-2 might have evolved from the bat coronavirus by accumulating favorable genetic changes for human infection. The structural proteins spike and membrane were shown to have extensive mutational changes, whereas envelope and nucleocapsid proteins were conserved. It remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acts as an intermediate host between bats and humans.",
                        "Structural and functional analysis showed that the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 strongly interacts with the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 expression was highest in lung, heart, ileum, kidney and bladder. In lung, ACE2 was highly expressed on lung epithelial cells. Following binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor, the spike protein undergoes protease cleavage. A two-step sequential protease cleavage to activate spike protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was proposed as a model, consisting of cleavage at the S1/S2 cleavage site for priming and a cleavage for activation at the S\u20322 site, a position adjacent to a fusion peptide within the S2 subunit. After cleavage at the S1/S2 cleavage site, S1 and S2 subunits remain non-covalently bound and the distal S1 subunit contributes to the stabilization of the membrane-anchored S2 subunit in the profusion state. Subsequent cleavage at the S2 site presumably activates the spike for membrane fusion via irreversible, conformational changes. The coronavirus spike is unique among viruses because a range of different proteases can cleave and activate it. The characteristics specific to SARS-CoV-2 among coronaviruses is the existence of a furin cleavage site (\u201cRPPA\u201d sequence) at the S1/S2 site. The S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 was entirely subjected to cleavage during biosynthesis in contrast to SARS-CoV spike, which was incorporated into assembly without cleavage. Although the S1/S2 site was also subjected to cleavage by other proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L, the ubiquitous expression of furin also likely contributes to more efficient viral replication leading to increased virulence. In SARS-CoV-2, the viral spike protein and in particular the RBD is a locus for viral evolution. From October 2020, evolution in the virus identified as amino acid changes within the RBD were detected in Europe, Brazil, United Kingdom, and South Africa. The accumulation of mutations resulted in approximately one mutation occurring every two weeks, as exhibited by the variants emerging from the UK, South Africa, and Brazil which had 8 mutations, 7 mutations, and 10 mutations in the Spike RBD, respectively as well as the deletion of 3 amino acids in the 1ab open reading frame (ORF). The characteristics of these variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 indicate repeated convergent evolution towards viral species with enhanced fitness. A possible hypothesis for this phenomenon is that these mutations emerge from cases of chronic COVID-19 infection during which the immune system places great pressure on the virus to escape immunity and the virus reacts by refining its mechanisms of infiltrating cells. This therefore translates to increased viral load and higher transmissibility, as demonstrated by the UK mutant strain, B.1.1.7. In a virus-na\u00efve population, natural immunity selection pressure is the main driver for the emergence of variants. However, there is also a possibility of a \u2018vaccine selection pressure\u2019 wherein mutations may be conceived due to vaccine-related reasons. The virus could evolve antigenicelly when vaccines elicit a restricted immune response such as when vaccines are directed to raise an immune response against a single antigen only. Time delays in administering vaccine shots across a whole population can also potentially affect the adaptability of the virus and induce mutations that can help them evade or resist immune response. The phenomenon of escape mutants highlights the need for a vaccine that works effectively against emerging variants of concern (VOC). As most of the recorded mutations are occurring in the spike protein, other viral antigens may be utilized to induce a wider breadth of immunogenicity to ensure adequate prophylactic immune response.",
                        "Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that bind and neutralize the virus within host cells and serve as a key correlate of immunity for prophylactic vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS and MERS spike glycoproteins play a predominant role in the protection against these coronaviruses. To date, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not known what magnitude of neutralizing antibodies is needed for protection, or what the durability of the neutralizing antibodies would be.",
                        "T cell immunity may also be utilized as a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2. T cell activation has been reported at both the acute and memory phases of infection, however the exact role of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in disease progression or protection is yet to be fully understood. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells directly target virus-infected cells, while Th1 polarized CD4 T cells have the potential to activate CD8 T cells and monocytes to combat virus-infected cells in tissues. In addition, T follicular helper cells are necessary for germinal center responses and the formation of high quality humoral immune responses. Consistent with this, multiple studies have noted a correlation between binding antibody titres and CD4 T cell response. Thus. T cells can have a protective function both via direct elimination of infected cells, and via activation of other leukocytes and enhancement of humoral immune responses. Moreover, the induction of a robust Th1-biased response is consistent with the unlikely occurrence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which is associated with a Th2 response.",
                        "The vaccines of the instant invention are based on a combination of antigens to generate better long-term protection and guard against the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. This is a major distinction over vaccines being developed which comprise a spike antigen only. The presence of multiple antigens may also address the phenomenon of escape mutants as multiple antigens may elicit a wider breadth of immune responses, which would make it more difficult for the virus to evolve antigenically and erode the effectiveness of the body's defenses.",
                        "The antigenic sequences for the vaccines of the instant invention comprise the spike protein, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2.",
                        "Immunogenicity may be achieved by expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike polypeptide or the S1 receptor binding domain subunit of the spike polypeptide from a poxvirus vector. The spike protein of coronaviruses contains the major neutralizing domains which are essential to neutralize the virus required during the acute phase of viral infection and is required to stimulate cell-mediated immunity. Historically, the spike protein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have been found immunogenic, eliciting humoral immune responses including neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus entry into host cells as well as cell-mediated immune responses.",
                        "Immunogenicity may be achieved by expressing the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein polypeptide from a poxvirus vector. In SARS-CoV, the membrane protein has been shown to be abundant on the viral surface; moreover, when used for immunization in patients with SARS, the membrane protein induced high titres of neutralizing antibodies. Immunogenic and structural analyses demonstrated that a T-cell epitope cluster capable of triggering a robust cellular immune response exists in the membrane protein. As the membrane protein is also highly conserved in many virus species, it is a good antigen candidate for inducing immune response against SARS-CoV-2.",
                        "Immunogenicity may be achieved by expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein polypeptide from a poxvirus vector. It was recently discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to production of antibodies that are mostly directed to the nucleocapsid antigen. However. N antibodies have been overlooked as N protein antibodies cannot block virus entry and as such are considered \u2018non-neutralizing\u2019 antibodies. Therefore, anti-N antibodies cannot be measured by neutralization assays that are currently in use to assess humoral immunity. Recent studies have shown that anti-N antibodies that get inside cells are recognized by an antibody receptor TRIM21, which then shreds the associated N protein. N protein epitopes are then displayed for detection by T cells. As this immune response mechanism involves T cells that will eventually mediate immunological memory, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein may stimulate long-term protection against future infection.",
                        "Immunogenicity may be achieved by simultaneously expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or parts thereof, membrane protein polypeptide, nucleocapsid protein polypeptide, and/or envelope protein polypeptide within a poxvirus vector. Studies on mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and SARS-CoV has established that spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and in some cases, envelope structural proteins, are required for the efficient assembly and release of virus like particles (VLPs) by transfected cells. The presence of S, M, and N and/or E polypeptides may lead to the formation of authentic VLPs, empty virus shells that mimic the coronavirus structure but lack the genetic material to be infectious. VLPs share similar size and morphological features with authentic virions but are non-infectious and unable to replicate. VLPs not only mimic the morphology of the native virus but can also transduce permissive cells. Devoid of viral genetic material, VLPs do not replicate within the host cell, but can be used as carriers for nucleic acids, proteins, or drugs. Further. VLPs have been investigated for use as vaccine candidates as their repetitive exposition of surface antigens and their inherent structure can emulate native viruses and interact with the immune system to induce humoral and cellular responses. The combined immunogenicity of these proteins may bring about a more robust antigen-specific immune response. The invention encompasses the use of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or part thereof, and/or SARS-CoV-2 membrane and/or SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid proteins or parts thereof, and/or SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein or part thereof, as antigen/s in a poxviral-vectored vaccine.",
                        "The invention encompasses the use of multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins to elicit a broad range of immune responses, including humoral and cell-mediated immunity. In a natural infection, the immune system recognizes all the proteins comprising SARS-CoV-2, to varying degrees. By utilizing structural genes with less mutational frequencies such as the M, N, and E, in the formulation of a vaccine, the breadth of immune response induced may be expanded to protect against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the probability of escape mutants.",

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has been impacting a large number of people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 29,700 nucleotides long and has a 79.5% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV; it has a 5 end long ORF1ab polyprotein that encodes 15 or 16 non-structural proteins while the 3\u2032 end genome encodes the four main structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope). SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin receptor conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on host cells for viral entry and eventual pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects the respiratory system with symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea.

While most emerging mutations will not have a significant impact on the spread, mutations that confer selective advantage to the virus are generally retained as reflected in the increased prevalence of the variant in the population. Among the numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants recorded, a select few are of public health concern due to their increased transmissibility, capacity to inflict a more severe illness, and/or increased ability to elude the immune response that develops following infection or vaccination. In 2021, three specific viral lineages reflecting variants of concern (VOC) have emerged: 0.11.7, 8.1.351, and 8.1.1.28.1. The mutation referred to as 0614G is shared by the three variants of concern.

The B.1.1.7 variant was initially identified in the south of England in September 2020. This variant has a mutation in the RBD of the spike protein at position 501, where the amino acid asparagine (N) has been replaced with tyrosine (Y), hence the mutation is referred to as N501Y. The B.1.1.7 variant is associated with more efficient and rapid transmission and increased risk of death compared with other variants. The B1.1.351 variant was initially identified in South Africa in October 2020. This variant has multiple mutations in the spike protein, including K417N. E484K, and N501Y. The mutation E484K has been shown to affect neutralization by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The 81.1.28 variant, specifically the P.1 branch of the lineage, was initially identified in January 2021 in travelers from Brazil who arrived in Japan. The P.1 lineage contains three mutations in the spike protein RBD, including K417T, E484K, and N501Y. The mutations increase the transmissibility and antigenic profile of SARS-CoV-2.",

The terms \u201cattenuation\u201d, \u201cattenuated\u201d and the like, as used herein, mean a reduction of viral vector virulence. Virulence is typically defined as the ability of a virus to cause disease in a particular host. For instance, a poxvirus that is unable to produce infectious viruses may initially infect cells but is substantially unable to replicate itself fully or propagate within the host or host cell or cause a disease or condition. This is desirable, as the poxvirus vector can deliver nucleic acid to the host or host cell, but typically does not harm the host or host cell.",

The Chordopoxvidnae comprises eight genera including the Orthopoxviridae comprising species which infect man while the Entomopoxvirinae infect insects. The Orthopoxviridae includes for example, variola virus which is the causative agent of smallpox, cowpox virus which formed the original smallpox vaccine reported by Jenner in 1796, and vaccinia virus which has been used as a second generation smallpox vaccine. The Avipoxviridae virus comprises species that infect birds, such as fowlpox and canarypox viruses. In addition to their use as antigens in smallpox vaccines, there is much interest in the use of recombinant vaccinia-based viruses and avipox viruses as vectors for delivering and/or expressing heterologous genes of interest. As intracytoplasmic vectors, the Orthopoxviridae are able to deliver foreign antigens to the host cytoplasm and antigen processing pathways that process antigens to peptides for presentation on the cell surface. Such vectors expressing foreign antigens are suitable for use in gene therapy and the development of vaccines for a wide range of conditions and diseases.",

Historically, the spike protein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have been found immunogenic, eliciting humoral immune responses including neutralizing antibodies that inhibit virus entry into host cells as well as cell-mediated immune responses. Immunogenicity may also be achieved by inducing spike-specific T cell responses.

Immunogenic and structural analyses demonstrated that a T-cell epitope cluster capable of triggering a robust cellular immune response exists in the membrane protein.

Membrane-specific cellular and humoral responses induced by the SCV-COVID vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus complemented with the Th1-biased production of antibodies induced by the poxvirus vector may provide prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
                        "Immunogenicity may be achieved by expressing the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein polypeptide from a poxvirus vector. It was recently discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to production of antibodies that are mostly directed to the nucleocapsid antigen. However, N antibodies have been overlooked as N protein antibodies cannot block virus entry and as such are considered \u2018non-neutralizing\u2019 antibodies. Therefore, anti-N antibodies cannot be measured by neutralization assays that are currently in use to assess humoral immunity, Recent studies have shown that anti-N antibodies that get inside cells are recognized by an antibody receptor TRIM21, which then shreds the associated N protein. N protein epitopes are then displayed for detection by T cells. As this immune response mechanism involves T cells that will eventually mediate immunological memory, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein might stimulate long-term protection against future infection. Nucleocapsid-specific cellular and humoral responses induced by the SCV-COVID vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus complemented with the Th1-biased production of antibodies induced by the poxvirus vector may provide prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The combined immunogenicity of the structural proteins may bring about a more robust antigen-specific immune response. Furthermore, the presence of S. M, and N and/or E polypeptides may lead to the formation of an authentic virus like particle (VLP), empty virus shells that mimic the coronavirus structure but lacks the genetic material to be infectious. Antigen- and VLP-specific cellular and humoral response induced by the SCV-COVID vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus complemented with the Th1-biased production of antibodies induced by the poxvirus vector may provide prophylactic protection against COVID-19.

Each cassette consists of the transgene flanked by the necessary control elements of a poxvirus promoter and Kozak sequence upstream, and poxvirus early transcription termination signal downstream to enable gene expression. Flanking endonuclease recognition sites may also have been included to enable molecular manipulation.

The HR plasmid contains the HR cassette consisting of flanking recombination arms (F1 and F2) homologous to poxvirus genome sites between which the transgene is located. Homologous recombination sites relative to the vaccinia-COP genome are indicated in FIG. 2. The transgene expression cassette is inserted between the recombination arms, adjacent to additional poxvirus expression cassettes containing genes to enable positive selection of the new recombinant virus (e.g. CP77, Zeocin resistance or other drug selection combined with a fluorescent reporter protein such as green or blue fluorescent protein (GFP or BFP). Selection genes are flanked by 150 bp of identical, non-coding DNA sequence to enable selection gene deletion once the parent virus has been eliminated. To prepare the HR plasmid for virus construction, restriction endonuclease digestion (e.g. Not I) is used to release the HR cassette.

Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01 pfu/cell for 1 hour with SCV-SMX06, a replication-incompetent vaccinia virus derived from the Copenhagen strain that has the D13L, A39R, B7/88R, and C3L ORFs deleted. Infected cells were then transfected with the Not I digested homologous recombination plasmid using a transfection reagent such as EFFECTENE\u00ae (Qiagen). The infected/transfected cells are incubated for 2 to 3 days until fluorescent cells could be seen. The recombinant virus was purified from the parent virus using repeated positive drug selection and fluorescence-based single cell sorting. After parent virus removal was achieved (confirmed by PCR), any additional expression cassettes were inserted in iterations of homologous recombination and purification. In the absence of parent virus, selection pressure was removed to allow deletion of selection genes via intramolecular recombination between the 150 bp repeats during infection of BC19A-12 cells. Viruses without selection markers were enriched and purified by fluorescence-based single cell sorting and/or limiting dilution. Once the virus population was selection marker free, candidate clones were then amplified in BC19A-12 cells to generate virus seed stocks that were validated by PCR and DNA sequencing for transgene location and integrity, and western blot or other immunostaining technique for transgene expression.",

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 initiates an immune response which includes the production of antibodies, or binding antibodies, in the blood. Using purified receptor binding domain (RBD), protein from the viral spike (S) protein and the host cell receptor ACE2, the test mimics the virus-host interaction by direct protein-protein interaction in a test tube or a well of an ELISA plate. The highly specific interaction can then be neutralized, the same manner as in a conventional Virus Neutralization Test. Briefly, samples and controls diluted with sample dilution buffer and pre-incubated with the HRD-conjugated RBD to allow the binding of the circulating neutralization antibodies to HRP-RBD. The mixture is then added to the capture plate, which is pre-coated with ACE2 protein. The unbound HRP-RBD as well as and HRP-RBD bound to non-neutralizing antibody will be captured on the plate, while the circulating neutralization antibodies HRP-RBD complexes remain in the supernatant and are removed during washing. Following a wash cycle, TMB substrate solution is added followed by the Stop Solution and the reaction is then quenched and the color turns yellow.

Thus, there is considerable concern for interference of orthopoxvirus-specific pre-existing immunity with subsequent SCV-COVID19 vaccinations, that may result in reduced vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.

In some cases, inoculation with the multicomponent vaccine elicits less antibody than when the components are administered alone.

An antigen with dominant B cell and or T cell epitopes will produce a stronger immune response than an antigen that have sub-optimal B-cell or T-cell epitopes.
