                        "2. Description of Related Art",
                        "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in women after lung cancer and it is the most common cancer among women worldwide (23% of all new cancer cases). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to the breast cancer phenotype where the estrogen and progesterone receptor are negative, as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and there is a lack of overexpression of HER2 as assessed by IHC or the absence of its gene amplification as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique.",
                        "An estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. Of these, approximately 170,000 (12%-20%) are of the triple-negative (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212) phenotype. Of these TNBC cases, about 75% are \u201cbasal-like.\u201d As regard the molecular complexity of TNBC, six subtypes of TNBC have been identified, basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. TNBC is an important area for both researchers and clinicians because (I) TNBC is a poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS); (II) no effective specific targeted therapy is readily available for TNBC; (III) there is a clustering of TNBC cases in premenopausal women and in women of African descent; and (IV) the overlap of BRCA1-associated breast cancers with the TNBC phenotype is significant.",
                        "TNBC are biologically aggressive. Although some reports suggest that they respond to chemotherapy better than other types of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. This is due to: shortened disease-free interval in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and a more aggressive course in the metastatic setting.",
                        "The therapeutic strategies for the management of TNBC are targeting DNA repair complex like (platinum compounds and taxanes), P53 like (taxanes), cell proliferation like (anthracycline containing regimen) and targeted therapy. Also several neoadjuvant studies have sought to determine the additive benefit of incorporating novel chemotherapeutics with standard chemotherapy like anthracycline, taxanes, antimetabolites, platinum agents and novel microtubule stabilizing agents. Although the specific adjuvant regimens that may be most effective for TNBC remains incompletely defined for both early stage and advanced disease, third-generation chemotherapy regimens using dose dense or metronomic polychemotherapy like those offered to other high-risk patients are among the most effective tools presently available. Platinum agents have seen renewed interest in TNBC since the association of BRCA1 mutations and dysfunctional DNA repair with TN may indicate an increased sensitivity toward DNA-damaging agents like platinum agents based on preclinical and clinical data. Sensitivity has also been shown to DNA double-strand breaks, such as those induced by etoposide and bleomycin. Whereas patients with HER-2-overexpressing have repeatedly been indicated to derive the most pronounced benefit from anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, results on the efficacy of anthracycline-based regimens in patients with TNBC remain controversial.",
                        "Taxanes are active in TNBC and remain important agents but have not shown specific benefit over non-TNBC. The chemosensitivity of tumors harboring p53 mutations, a characteristic of TNBC is controversial as resistance of p53-mutated breast cancers to anthracycline chemotherapy has been reported. In the metastatic setting, TNBC patients with higher rates of visceral metastases have a relatively shorter median survival of 7-13 months and have limited duration of response to successive lines of chemotherapy. It is important to select the agents most likely to result in a meaningful benefit.",
                        "TNBC is itself a heterogeneous group. Therefore, the identification of molecular biomarkers to predict response to specific chemotherapy is required to further improve treatment strategies with the current menu of chemotherapy options and future combinations with targeted therapies."

                        "Overview",
                        "Applicants have discovered certain pharmaceutical compositions having robust, potent, effect on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells. The pharmaceutical compositions include a combination of Eribulin (2-(3-Amino-2-hydroxypropyl)hexacosahydro-3-methoxy-26-methyl-20,27-bis(methylene)11,15-18,21-24,28-triepoxy-7,9-ethano-12,15-methano-9H,15H-furo(3,2-i)furo(2\u2032,3\u2032-5,6) pyrano(4,3-b)(1,4)dioxacyclopentacosin-5-(4H)-one; CAS Registry No. 253128-41-5; Formula I) and CYC065 (2-[1-[[(E)-3-chloroprop-2-enoxy]amino]ethylidene]-5-(2-ethylsulfanylpropyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione; CAS Registry No. 111031-76-6; Formula II):",
                        "The combination of Eribulin and CYC065 is demonstrated to act with surprisingly potent synergistic effect in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells when compared to compositions containing only one of the two compounds alone.",
                        "To evaluate the effectiveness of Eribulin and CYC065 in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 having the triple-negative phenotype was tested. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on tissue culture plates and cultured for \u02dc18 h. Cells were treated with different doses of either drug [Eribulin (0.1 nM-100 nM); CYC065 (50 nM-1000 nM)] for 48 h. Proliferation was quantified using the MTS assay. Both drugs were able to inhibit proliferation in the nM range (see FIGS. 1A and 1B).",
                        "The ability of a composition including Eribulin and CYC065 to inhibit inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells was evaluated in three different cell lines having the triple-negative phenotype: MDA-MB-231 (FIG. 2A), HS-478T (FIG. 2B) and MDA-MB-436 (FIG. 2C). The cells were seeded on tissue culture plates and cultured for \u02dc18 h. The cells were then contacted with 300 nM CYC065 alone, 5 nM Eribulin alone or a combination of 300 nM CYC065 and 5 nM Eribulin for 48 h. While both drugs inhibited tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells when the cells were contacted with each drug alone, the combination of both CYC065 and Eribulin brought about even greater inhibition than expected from the additive effects of the drugs alone (see FIGS. 2A-C).",
                        "To further evaluate the effects of the combination of CYC065 and Eribulin on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells, the MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in pre-formed Matrigel hydrogels (modeling a \u201c3D\u201d environment) and contacted for 2 days or 4 days with CYC065 alone, Eribulin alone or a combination of CYC065 and Eribulin. As found with the plated cell lines, the combination of both CYC065 and Eribulin brought about even greater inhibition than expected from the additive effects of the drugs alone (see FIGS. 3A-D).",
                        "The synergistic action of CYC065 and Eribulin in effecting inhibition of tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells is an unexpected, surprising result. These finding indicate the combination of CYC065 and Eribulin can have robust effect of inhibitory tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.",
                        "Pharmaceutical Compositions",
                        "The present disclosure contemplates pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosed compound(s) for administration to mammals for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells. In a preferred embodiment, a composition for administration is a pharmaceutical composition, preferably in a single unit dosage form. Pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms can comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents, and a typically one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients or diluents.",
                        "The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government (for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.",
                        "The compounds of this invention may exist as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to salts or zwitterions of the compounds which are water or oil-soluble or dispersible, suitable for treatment of disorders without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, commensurate with a reasonable benefit:risk ratio and effective for their intended use. The salts may be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting an amino group of the compounds with a suitable acid. For example, a compound may be dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as but not limited to methanol and water and treated with at least one equivalent of an acid, like hydrochloric acid. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be isolated by filtration and dried under reduced pressure.",
                        "Alternatively, the solvent and excess acid may be removed under reduced pressure to provide a salt. Representative salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, formate, isethionate, fumarate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, oxalate, maleate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, para-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric and the like. The amino groups of the compounds may also be quaternized with alkyl chlorides, bromides and iodides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, lauryl, myristyl, stearyl and the like.",
                        "Basic addition salts may be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the present compounds by reaction of a carboxyl group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or aluminum, or an organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. Quaternary amine salts derived from methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine. N-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylphenethylamine, 1-ephenamine and N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine, and the like, are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.",
                        "The compounds may be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject (such as a patient, which may be a human or non-human). The pharmaceutical compositions may include a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d or a \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d of the agent. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may be determined by a person skilled in the art and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the composition to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the agent are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.",
                        "The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water, DMSO or the aforementioned oils can be preferred carriers when the pharmaceutical composition is administered. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Pharmaceutical compositions can, but need not, comprise one or more active or inactive ingredients that are not necessarily considered pharmaceutically acceptable to current practitioners in the art.",
                        "Methods of treatment may include any number of modes of administering the composition of the present invention. Modes of administration for subjects may include aqueous, lipid, oily or other solutions, emulsions such as oil-in-water emulsions, liposomes, aqueous or oily suspensions, and syrups. In the pharmaceutical composition, the agent may also be dispersed in a microparticle, e.g., a nanoparticulate composition.",
                        "Typical pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well-known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including, but not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient and the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. The composition or single unit dosage form, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.",
                        "The disclosure further encompasses administration of pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as \u201cstabilizers,\u201d include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers.",
                        "The formulation should suit the mode of administration. In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms are sterile and prepared in a form suitable for administration to a subject, preferably an animal subject, more preferably a mammalian subject, and most preferably a human subject. Besides humans, preferred animal subjects include horses, birds, cats, dogs, rats, hamsters, mice, guinea pigs, cows and pigs.",
                        "Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: gels, dispersions; ointments; liquid dosage forms suitable for administration to a patient, including suspensions (for example, aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions; and sterile solids (for example, crystalline or amorphous solids or granular forms) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for administration to a patient.",
                        "The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms of a preparation of the described compounds will typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells may contain larger amounts of one or more of a preparation of the disclosed compounds than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Also, the therapeutically effective dosage form may vary among different types of diseases or disorders. Similarly, a dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease or disorder. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary firm one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).",
                        "Generally, the ingredients of compositions comprising a preparation of the disclosed compounds are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the certain dosage forms are solid and prepared under anhydrous conditions with anhydrous ingredients, as described in detail in the sections above. However, the scope of the invention extends beyond anhydrous, solid oral dosage forms. As such, further forms are described herein.",
                        "Typical dosage forms can be prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) (that is, a preparation of the disclosed compound(s)) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.",
                        "Examples of excipients that can be used in dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to lubricants. Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, con oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof.
