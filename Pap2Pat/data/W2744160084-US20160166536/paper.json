    "title": "Synergistic effect of eribulin and CDK inhibition for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer",
    "date": "2017-08-10",
    "abstract": "Activation of CDK2 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) can contribute to non-canonical phosphorylation of a TGF\u03b2 signaling component, Smad3, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Inhibition of CDK2 was shown to decrease breast cancer oncogenesis. Eribulin chemotherapy was used effectively in the treatment of TNBC. To this end, we tested therapeutic efficacy of a novel CDK2/9 inhibitor, CYC065, eribulin, and the combination of CYC065 and eribulin in 3 different TNBC cell lines, and an in vivo xenograft model. Specifically, we characterized cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, cell cycle associated protein expression, treatment-related transcription factor activity, and tumor growth in TNBC. Treatment with CYC065 and eribulin in combination had a superior effect on decreasing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting migration in TNBC cell lines in vitro. Combination therapy inhibited non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation at the T179 site in the protein linker region, and resulted in increased p15 and decreased c-myc expression. In a transcription factor array, combination treatment significantly increased activity of AP1 and decreased activity of factors including NF\u03baB, SP1, E2F, and SMAD3. In an in vivo xenograft model of TNBC, individual and combination treatments resulted in a decrease in both tumor volume and mitotic indices. Taken together, these studies highlight the potential of this novel drug combination, CYC065 and eribulin, to suppress the growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, warranting further clinical investigation.",

                "Approximately 15% of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer cases lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression [1]. Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tend to exhibit more aggressive cancer biology and can develop cancers that overexpress cyclins D and E [2, 3]. Consequently, TNBC is associated with a higher rate of recurrence and a relatively lower rate of disease-specific survival [1]. Despite the aggressive disease biology and poor outcomes associated with TNBC, currently there are no targeted treatment regimens available for patients with this disease subtype. This unfavorable biology and lack of targeted therapy highlight the urgent need for a novel discovery to facilitate a more tailored treatment approach to improve outcomes for patients with TNBC.",
                "Several aspects of breast cancer onset and disease progression have been linked to members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily of growth factors and the associated downstream signaling components, the Smads [4]. Alterations in Smad3 signaling have been attributed to cyclin overexpression, and were directly implicated in the dichotomous role of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily in malignancy, enacting both tumor suppressant and tumor promoting behaviors in breast carcinogenesis. Prior studies [5\u20138] have shown that cyclin-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/2 led to the non-canonical phosphorylation of Smad3, primarily at sites pT8, pT179, pS204, pS208, and pS213, consequently promoting cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and cell migration. We have also shown that CDK2 inhibition can block non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation, resulting in restoration of the tumor-suppressor role of Smad3 in TNBC [9]. To this end, implementing a laboratory grade CDK2 inhibitor in combination with paclitaxel in vivo resulted in decreased TNBC tumor volume and decreased Ki67 tumor cell staining [9]. Furthermore, treatment of TNBC cells with CYC065, a pharmaceutical grade CDK2/9 inhibitor, blocked the cis-trans isomerase, Pin1, and Smad3 interaction, resulting in decreased cell migration/invasion and impedance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition [10]. Collectively, these results indicate that CDK inhibitor therapy is a candidate strategy for patients with TNBC.",
                "In the context of metastatic breast cancer, eribulin, a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor, recently emerged as a single-agent therapy showing improved survival and a tolerable toxicity profile [11]. The impact of eribulin was examined in the Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study, Assessing Physician's Choice versus eribulin (EMBRACE) [11]. The study compared eribulin with \u2018treatment of physician's choice\u2019 (TPC) for patients with pre-treated metastatic breast cancer [11, 12]. The 1-year survival for patients treated with eribulin was 53.9% compared with 43.7% for patients who received TPC, showing promise for eribulin therapy in this setting [11]. Additionally, pooled analysis of the EMBRACE study, along with a study randomizing pre-treated metastatic patients to either eribulin or capecitabine, showed improved outcomes for TNBC patients treated with eribulin [13]. The efficacy and safety of eribulin was further demonstrated in a phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial for patients with early stage TNBC, with 43.3% of patients achieving a pathologic complete response [14]. Taken together, eribulin shows promise for the treatment of TNBC.",
                "As both CDK2 inhibition and eribulin have previously shown independent efficacy for the treatment of TNBC, we hypothesized that in combination, implementation of these mechanistically distinct and promising therapeutics would result in an increased treatment response against the aggressive TNBC subtype. As stated, previous studies have shown the anticancer efficacy of CDK inhibitors alone (e.g., dinaciclib targeting CDK1, 2, 5, and 9) [15] and in combination with chemotherapy, in vitro and in vivo [9]. However, CDK2 inhibition has not been extensively explored in combination with selected chemotherapeutics, such as eribulin, for the treatment of TNBC. In this study, we examined the combinatorial effects of CYC065, a CDK2/9 inhibitor in clinical development, and eribulin for the treatment of TNBC cell in vitro and in vivo [16]."

Both therapeutic agents inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1). From the dose curves, IC50 values were obtained: 300 nM for CYC065 and 5 nM for eribulin, and these values were subsequently utilized for all in vitro experiments. The individual and combinatorial effects of CYC065 and eribulin on proliferation of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and Hs578T cells were examined by MTS assay. For all study cell lines, combination treatment resulted in the greatest decrease in cell proliferation as compared to the control (p < 0.0001) and individual treatments (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C, p < 0.005, N \u2265 6).",

The effect of combination treatment on apoptosis was assessed using Annexin-V staining. In the study cell lines, combination treatment also resulted in the greatest increase in apoptosis as compared to control (p < 0.0001) and individual treatments (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F, p < 0.05, N \u2265 4)."

We examined the influence of CYC065 and eribulin, alone and in combination, on TNBC cells in a 3D \u201con top\u201d Matrigel culture system [19]. At day 2 and day 4 post-treatment, combination treatment resulted in the greatest decrease in colony size for all the study cell lines when compared to the control (p < 0.0001) and individual treatments (p < 0.05, Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, N = 4 hydrogels, n \u2265 65 colonies per group). As such, for the MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2) at day 2, colony size in the control group was 10196 \u00b1 461 \u03bcm2, and decreased to 4657 \u00b1 479 \u03bcm2 and 4527 \u00b1 409 \u03bcm2 after CYC065 and eribulin treatments, respectively. At day 2, after treatment with combination therapy, colony size had the greatest decrease to 2472 \u00b1 336 \u03bcm2. Similarly, at day 4, the colony size was the smallest after treatment with combination therapy (1764 \u00b1 348 \u03bcm2), followed by CYC065 (3807 \u00b1 377 \u03bcm2), eribulin (4165 \u00b1 419 \u03bcm2), and the control group (14716 \u00b1 461 \u03bcm2). These results show that in 3D culture, combination therapy was most impactful in reducing TNBC colony size, consistent with the observations in 2D culture (Figure 1)."

We examined protein expression associated with canonical Smad3 signaling and targets of cyclin E/CDK2 inhibition [TGF-\u03b2-regulated pSmad3 T179, p15 and c-myc [4]] to assess factors associated with the inhibitory effect of CYC065 and eribulin on cell growth and migration (Figure 4). Combination treatment with CYC065 and eribulin resulted in a significant decrease in Smad3 phosphorylation at the non-canonical T179 residue relative to control (p < 0.05, Figure 4A, 4D). Moreover, expression of oncogenic c-myc was decreased after treatment with individual CYC065 (p < 0.001), eribulin (p < 0.01) and combination treatments (p < 0.001) (Figure 4B, 4D). Expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p15 increased after individual CYC065 treatment (p < 0.05) and combination treatment (p < 0.001, Figure 4C, 4D).

Treatment with eribulin alone resulted in a decrease in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase (41.7%, p<0.05), and treatment with the combination therapy resulted in a more moderate increase the proportion of cells in G1 phase (47.52%, p<0.05). In terms of S phase, single agent treatment with CYC065 resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase and this decrease was also found after the cells were treated with combination therapy (37.28% baseline, decreased to 23.67% after CYC065, and 17.56% after combination therapy, p<0.0001). No significant change in the S phase proportion was observed after treatment with eribulin alone (37.55% in S phase). After treatment with CYC065 alone, a marginal effect was observed for the G2 phase cell population (baseline 18.14% increased to 20.94%, p<0.05), with a more significant increase identified after combination therapy (34.91%, p<0.0001).

Treatment with individual CYC065, eribulin, or the drug combination resulted in decreased factor activity for SRF, SRE, SP1, HIF1, IRF1, and E2F (Supplementary Table 2). The decrease in these factors was sustained after combination treatment. Additionally, CYC065 and eribulin treatments alone and in combination resulted in increased AR and AP1 factor activity. For NF\u03baB, treatment with CYC065 or the combination resulted in a pronounced decrease in activity, while treatment with eribulin resulted in increased activity. Relative to treatment with CYC065 or combination therapy, treatment with eribulin also resulted in other distinct changes, including increased activity in factors YY1, Smad3, KLF4, GATA, and CRE. Additionally, after CYC065 and combination treatment, YY1 and Smad3 activity decreased and then normalized, while other factors within the cluster initially decreased and then increased, including PAX6 and P53/73.

Compared to the control group, treatment with either CYC065 or eribulin resulted in decreased tumor volume (Figure 6A). Average tumor volume at day 55 post-treatment for CYC065 and eribulin was 333 \u00b1 67 mm3 and 334 \u00b1 44 mm3, respectively, versus 1064 \u00b1 367 mm3 for the control group, p < 0.005.

                "TNBC lacks effective therapeutic targets and consequently, treatment for this disease subtype remains limited, involving surgery, a small number of first-line systemic chemotherapies, and radiotherapy [1]. The challenge to identify targeted treatments for TNBC is, in part, attributable to the molecular heterogeneity of this cancer subtype and therapeutic resistance. Given these treatment challenges, outcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor. Thus, it is essential to identify new therapeutic targets and apply novel treatment strategies to improve TNBC disease-specific survival. In this study, we showed that treatment with CYC065 and eribulin synergistically reduced TNBC cell viability, tumor colony size, and cell migration, and induced apoptosis in vitro. We also showed that treatment was associated with decreased non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation and mitogenic c-myc expression, as well as increased expression of cell regulatory cdki p15 and G1 cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, we identified several active changes in transcription factors that were specific to CYC065 and eribulin treatment, alone and in combination, to further associate mechanistic events with treatment effects. Importantly, we found that in vivo, individual CYC065 and eribulin treatments resulted in decreased tumor volume and mitotic indices, and that tumor volume and mitotic index were further decreased after treatment with combination therapy. Taken together, the encouraging results from this study show the potential for the CYC065/eribulin treatment combination to benefit patients with TNBC.",
                "The possibility of targeting CDKs with single agent therapy or in conjunction with standard breast cancer treatment shows promise, and has been an area of active study. We have previously demonstrated the impact of CDK4 inhibition, in combination with doxorubicin chemotherapy, to reduce hormone receptor positive, cyclin D-overexpressing breast cancer cell growth [21]. CDK4 inhibition, along with doxorubicin, was associated with the restoration of canonical Smad3 signaling, repression of survivin and XIAP, and an increase in pro-apoptotic Smac/DIABLO expression [21]. Recently, the PALOMA-3 trial showed prolonged progression-free survival for hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients after treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, and fulvestrant [22]. Additional work showed the impact of palbociclib with anastrozole to cause increased breast cancer cell cycle arrest when compared to treatment with anastrozole alone [23]. The importance of molecular subtyping to help identify appropriate patient selection and optimize treatment efficacy was also highlighted in that study [23]. To this end, the TNBC cell lines used in the current study are from the mesenchymal-like subpopulation, and are known to express mutant p53 [24]. There is potential for the development of therapeutics that selectively target cancer cells with mutant p53 for cell death [25]. In the setting of TNBC and cyclin E/CDK2 expression, our current findings reinforce the critical relationship between repression of non-canonical Smad3 mediated CDK phosphorylation, repression of myc, and increased expression of cdki p15 to facilitate decreased cancer cell viability and increased cell death. These findings also underscore the importance of patient selection regarding the rational implementation of CDK inhibitor therapy, with hormone receptor negative, cyclin E/CDK2 expressing TNBC more likely to respond to CDK2 inhibition [9].",
                "Previously, flavopiridol, an inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9, was shown to induce both cancer cell cycle arrest and cytotoxic effects [26]. While initial therapeutic potential was shown for flavopiridol, particularly against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), efficacy was not consistent, and the drug is not currently being examined for clinical use [26]. Dinaciclib, a CDK 1, 2, 5, and 9 inhibitor, has shown more favorable anti-tumor effects against CLL and solid tumors [26, 27]. Recently, dinaciclib was found to have activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against TNBC [28]. In the current study, treatment with CYC065 resulted in a significant increase in TNBC cell G1 phase cell cycle distribution. Inhibition of CDK9, similar to CYC065, was also shown to be critical to tumor suppression [29]. Specifically in TNBC, inhibition of CDK9 has been linked to decreased cyclin B1 and MYC, and treatment with dinaciclib resulted in G2/M phase arrest and cancer cell apoptosis [28]. However, to date, neither flavopiridol nor dinaciclib treatment resulted in prolonged progression free-survival when compared to clinically available treatments for patients with solid tumors [26, 30, 31]. Potential reasons for the findings of these clinical studies may be secondary to study design and drug regimens, or the lack of selectivity, as patients were not included based on relevant clinical tumor biomarkers, such as cyclin/CDK expression.",
                "To this end, prior work examined breast cancer cells with amplified human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), to identify mechanisms of resistance to the targeted therapy, trastuzumab [32]. Trastuzumab-resistant HER2 positive breast cancer cells were subjected to a genome-wide analysis that revealed several changes, including amplification of the cyclin E gene, CCNE1 [32]. This finding was pursued under the auspices that cyclin E/CDK2 activity was critical to G1 cell cycle regulation, and that upregulated cyclin E/CDK2 could potentially contribute to resistance to trastuzumab-induced G1 arrest [32]. To examine this hypothesis, trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer was treated with CYC065, which resulted in significantly reduced cancer cell viability both in vitro and in vivo [32]. These findings support the importance of mechanism driven, rational selection of cancer subtypes for treatment with targeted CDK inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the upregulated cyclin E activity in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive breast cancer facilitates CDK2 mediated non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation, resulting in cell cycle progression and oncogenesis. This is the subject of ongoing study in our group, building from prior work showing that CDK2 inhibition of non-canonical Smad 3 phosphorylation enhanced the anti-tumor activity of taxane treatment in TNBC, both in vitro and in vivo [6, 9]. The current study adds to these findings, showing that pharmaceutical grade, orally available CYC065, combined with eribulin, a chemotherapy found to be particularly efficacious against TNBC, worked synergistically to cause TNBC cytoreduction, both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, combination CYC065/eribulin therapy resulted in the greatest reduction in TNBC growth and migration, when compared to individual CYC065 and eribulin treatments. These findings support the benefit of combining targeted approaches with chemotherapy for the treatment of TNBC, and are the first to provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of the CDK2/9 inhibitor, CYC065, in combination with eribulin for the treatment of TNBC.",
                "Eribulin mesylate, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, induces rapidly proliferating cells to irreversibly accrue in the mitotic phase and then undergo apoptosis [33, 34]. Eribulin is approved for patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline or taxane [11, 14]. Importantly, prior clinical studies with eribulin have shown a favorable treatment response for patients with TNBC [13, 14]. In the current work, eribulin treatment resulted in a decrease in TNBC cancer cell viability and tumor colony size, along with an increase in apoptosis. Additionally, treatment with eribulin resulted in a decrease in c-myc expression and a trend toward an increase in cdki p15. In vivo, these findings translated into single agent efficacy for eribulin resulting in both decreased TNBC tumor volume and mitotic index. Previously, eribulin was found to induce tumor mircovessel ingrowth, potentially contributing to a decrease in tumor hypoxia and an increase in tumor perfusion [33]. The beneficial impact of this eribulin effect was shown when MDA-MB-231 tumor xenographs, pretreated with eribulin, showed a greater cytoreductive response to secondary therapy with capecitabine [33, 35]. These findings support a rationale for the enhanced cytotoxic effect of combination therapy with eribulin and CYC065 found in the current study for the treatment of TNBC.",
                "To further investigate the individual and combined effects of CYC065 and eribulin on TNBC, we examined several cell regulatory transcription factors using a live cell activity array, TRACER. The most notable changes after treatment with individual CYC065 and combination therapies were an increase in AP1 and a decrease in NF\u03baB activity. These factor changes were largely attributable to the effect of CYC065, as eribulin alone elicited only minor alterations (Figure 5C). NF\u03baB activation, consisting of canonical and non-canonical pathways, has been associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor breast cancer outcomes [36]. Prior work has shown that CR8, a CDK 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 inhibitor and riscovitine derivative, suppressed canonical NF\u03baB activity in CLL [37, 38]. Additionally, recent work has shown that blocking NF\u03baB, along with MAPK factors, resulted in suppression of TNBC cell growth, suggesting that targeting of NF\u03baB could be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TNBC [39]. Accordingly, in the current study, the significant CYC065 treatment-induced decrease in NF\u03baB is likely associated with the TNBC growth inhibitory effect that was identified after exposure to this novel drug. Furthermore, SP1, a key factor influencing cell cycle mitogenesis and canonical NF\u03baB activity, was also decreased after CYC065 and eribulin treatments, but showed the most sustained decrease after treatment with combination therapy. Increased Sp1 gene expression has also been linked to poor outcomes for patients with TNBC, treated with doxorubicin [36]. After all the study treatments, a decrease was found for IRF1, another factor linked to NF\u03baB gene transcription [36]. Interestingly, prior work has demonstrated cooperation and co-regulation between SP1 and AP1 in the mediation of an indirect interaction between NF\u03baB and IRF, whereas NF\u03baB may act directly upon IRF [40]. Thus, crosstalk among these factors and the inhibition caused by treatment with CYC065 and eribulin, could contribute to the decrease in NF\u03baB activity, as well as IRF1 and SP1, and the lack of regulatory feedback of AP1, resulting in the increased activity of this factor in the study cells. Furthermore, Sp1 activity, along with NF\u03baB, may also be a marker of response to CYC065.",
                "SRE activity was significantly reduced after treatment with the CYC065/eribulin combination. Reduction of SRE, along with NF\u03baB, has been linked to decreased TNBC cell migration through an associated decrease in activation of an adhesion G protein coupled receptor [41]. These findings reflect the decrease in cell migration found in all the study cell lines after treatment with combination therapy, which caused a decrease in both SRE and NF\u03baB activity. Additionally, the sustained decrease in HIF1, which was found after treatment with CYC065 and combination therapy, has also been linked to a reduction in MMP expression, and may also be associated with the decreased TNBC cell migration found in this study [42]. The current study shows normalization of Smad3 factor activity by day 3, after treatment with CYC065 and combination therapy. We have also previously found a link with CDK2 inhibition, treatment with CYC065, and restoration of canonical Smad3 signaling, leading to the inhibition of the Pin1-Smad3 interaction, decreased MMP2 production, and decreased TNBC cell migration and invasion [9, 10]. All study treatments also caused a decrease in E2F and c-myc, with combination therapy resulting in the most sustained reduction in E2F. Cyclin E/CDK2 are involved in the activation of EF2, myc, and cell cycle mitogenesis [43]. Thus, CYC065-mediated inhibition of CDK2 also likely contributed to both decreased TNBC cell proliferation and migration through repression of E2F and c-myc. Taken together, these findings point toward multiple promising targets and potential mechanisms to understand CYC065/eribulin treatment impact on decreased TNBC oncogenesis.",
                "In summary, these results show that CYC065 therapy alone, and in combination with eribulin, hinder the growth of TNBC in vitro and in vivo. This drug combination has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with TNBC, given the current lack of therapeutic options for this aggressive disease subtype. Treatment with the CYC065 and eribulin resulted in decreased non-canonical Smad3 phosphorylation and c-myc expression, along with increased p15 and G1 phase cell cycle distribution. The ability to implement novel technologies, such as TRACER, and investigate promising drug combinations to link new data to treatment response serves as an outstanding opportunity to advance the care of TNBC. In this study, biomarkers to predict response to CYC065 and eribulin were identified including SP1 and NF\u03baB, which could provide improved discrimination for therapeutic decision-making. The clinical benefit of eribulin was recently demonstrated by a phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial for women with early stage TNBC [14]. The pre-clinical results of this study show promise for combined eribulin and CYC065 treatment, and provide a foundation for a clinical trial examining this combination in TNBC patients."

                        "To examine the activity of transcription factors (TF) in response to therapeutic treatments, we utilized a novel dynamic TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRray (TRACER) [45]. MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with lentiviral reporter constructs, which have a TF binding site that modifies the activity of a minimal TA promoter [20, 46\u201348]. Non-transduced cells were used as one control that is subtracted from all readings, and a second control involved cells transduced with a construct with only the minimal TA promoter (TA-FLuc) that is used to normalized the TF activity. Approximately 1500 MDA-MB-231 cells were mixed with reporter constructs individually, seeded on a black 384 well plate (Greiner BioSciences, Monroe, NC), and cultured for 2 days. Cells were then treated with eribulin alone (5 nM), CYC065 alone (300 nM), or treated in combination for an additional 3 days (drug solutions were replenished every day). To measure FLuc activity, 1 mM D-luciferin (Molecular Imaging Products) was added 45 minutes prior to imaging and bioluminescence imaging was performed using IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences) at various time points (day 0, 1, 2, and 3). For all treatment groups, each TF was examined in quadruplicate and independently repeated four times. Data was then pooled from all individual experiments and normalized using methodology previously described [46]. Briefly, at each time point, each reporter was normalized to the TA control reporter and the experimental control condition to calculate the log2 fold-change. A linear model was fit to the normalized log2 values for each TF and was used to generate estimated coefficients and standard error for each condition. The estimated coefficients and standard errors were used to compute moderated t-statistics, moderated F-statistics, and log-odds of differential expression. False discovery rate correction (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons, and TFs identified to be differentially active had an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 [49]. To generate heat maps, the replicate log2 fold-change for each condition and time-point was averaged. Normalized activity values for each time point were clustered using k-means clustering with random starts. The optimal number of clusters was determined by minimizing the sum-of-squares within groups compared to a permuted null model."
