                        "Metasurfaces are optical devices that utilize subwavelength-scale structuring to shape and manipulate electromagnetic waves. They are powerful complements to bulk refractive and scalar diffractive optics and have a wide range of potential uses and applications involving imaging, lithography, sensing, and/or computing platforms. To date, a broad range of metasurface design concepts have emerged. The most widely used methods may sample the desired phase profile at discrete points, and specify phase shifting elements, in order to form a nanoscale phased array, as illustrated in FIG. 1A. These methods utilize a library of simple, physically-intuitive building blocks including anisotropic waveguides, Mie resonators, plasmonic resonators, and dielectric transmit arrays and can quickly produce macroscale device designs. However, these approaches lack the necessary degrees of freedom to achieve high efficiency in devices designed for large angle deflections, multiple functions, and broadband responses, preventing metasurfaces from being practically applied in many contexts.",
                        "Topology optimization, including mathematical methodology that optimizes material layout for or within a given design space and for a given set of constraints with the goal of practicably maximizing the performance of the system relative to a desired reference. Certain optimization approaches, including objective-first and adjoint-based topology optimization, have produced photonic crystals, optical demultiplexers, and spectral splitters with effective performance resulting from the devices' unusual geometries and non-intuitive optical dynamics. More recently, topology optimization has led to high-performance metasurfaces with a broad range of capabilities, such as high-efficiency light deflection with nearly arbitrary input and output angles, spectral sorting of plane waves to distinct diffraction orders, and light focusing with field-curvature correction. While devices designed using topology optimization support enhanced efficiencies, they involve extensive computational resources that dramatically increase with the size of the device. As such, current topology-optimized devices are either microscale in dimension or limited to periodic structures with microscale unit cells."

Each of the wavelength-scale sections has phase shifting characteristics associated with the desired phase profile, for providing the plurality of connectable metasurface elements that optimally scatter light as involved for each section of the desired phase profile. In connection with the above approach involving curvilinear sectionizing, the desired phase profile may correspond to the above-characterized curvilinear phase profile which is subdivided into a series of linear wavelength-scale sections, each serving as a deflector. For the ith section deflecting a normally-incident beam to angle \u03b8i (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 1D), the phase profile is linear and periodic, with a phase period Dphase=\u03bb/sin \u03b8i. The spacing between phase shifting elements is defined such that the array of elements in the section is periodic with a period Dstructure. Furthermore, Dstructure may be specified to be an integer multiple of Dphase (see top inset of FIG. 1D). By enforcing these local periodicity conditions, the periodic structures may scatter light into a relatively narrow number of diffraction channels, via constructive interference effects. Light scattering into the continuum of other angles, which is undesirable, may be suppressed. These interference effects become more pronounced as the size of the segment becomes larger. For lenses, the phase profile away from the optical axis can be well approximated by long, linear sections. In these device regions, each grating-like section can support strong diffractive beam steering effects. Such structures may also be stitched together with the larger structures being based on such methodology used to design certain smaller stitched-together structures, and which in turn are based on such methodology used to design even smaller stitched-together structures.",

The dielectric distribution along with the amplitude and phase scattering profiles of the element at successive iterations in the optimization process are shown in FIG. 3A. FIG. 3A shows dielectric distribution results at a starting point, after 10 iterations, and after 100 iterations of an example optimization, in accordance with various embodiments. The optimization starts with a random dielectric continuum with values between air and silicon. After a few iterations, the continuum begins to strongly scatter light to the desired angle. The final metasurface section is a binary structure of silicon in air that possesses a peak scattering amplitude and phase response matching the targeted values. The full-width half-maximum of the scattering peak is consistent with that expected from light diffracting from a 2.5\u03bb-wide aperture, indicating that the element is performing directional scattering near its physical limits.",

To obtain high performance elements for a desired scattering angle and phase target, ten optimizations are performed with different initial dielectric distributions and the best result is selected.",

As an example, the metalenses may focus TM-polarized light at a wavelength of 640 nm. To enable device operation at visible wavelengths, 250 nm-thick crystalline silicon is used, which has relatively low absorption compared to polycrystalline and amorphous silicon, but has a higher index contrast than materials such as titanium dioxide.",

The metalenses are divided into 2 \u03bcm-wide linear sections, which is below the phase error limit of Eqn. 3 and near the optimal size for efficient computation (see FIG. 1C). Further reductions in the section size may lead to degradation of device performance. A reason may be traced to design of each metasurface element, which is optimized in isolation with PMP boundary conditions. When the elements are stitched together to produce a device, the optical fields that are guided by a single element have evanescent tails and can couple to a neighboring element in a parasitic manner. Smaller sections have more elements to be stitched together to produce a desired metasurface, thereby resulting in more boundaries and more parasitic coupling. Below a section size of 2\u03bb, the device performance may begin to degrade and below a section size of 1\u03bb, aperiodic boundary conditions in the optimizer may no longer be valid.",
                        "In other examples, there are a few approaches for addressing the issue of stitching error. One is to keep the section size relatively large compared to the wavelength. Another is to perform boundary optimization on the stitched regions themselves, to attempt to eliminate stitching error. A third approach, which is used, is to separate silicon structures from different sections by a gap of at least 0.2\u03bb, thereby reducing the near-field coupling between sections. To ensure a reduction of stitching error with such a scheme, stitched sections are simulated to check for spurious diffraction, and sections are redesigned in the event of excess error.",

Relative efficiency, or focusing efficiency, compares the power in the principal lobe to that of an ideal lens that transmits the same amount of power as the device. This efficiency corresponds to the efficiency of the diffraction process, as it removes the effects of absorption from the material and reflection at the metalens interface.",

This trend is unlike that of conventional metalenses, where efficiency decreases for increasing NA because conventional designs cannot efficiently deflect light to large angles. The absolute efficiencies of the metalenses are all above 75%, with approximately 10% of the light reflected from the metalens and 10% absorbed by the silicon. Reflection losses can be reduced with the use of more intricate three-dimensional silicon nanostructures, while absorption losses can be minimized by designing silicon-based devices for longer wavelength operation. A simulated field profile of the metalens with an NA of 0.9 is shown in FIG. 4B, demonstrating that the lens focuses strongly with minimal spurious diffraction.",

These periodic metasurfaces are designed to deflect light of a specific wavelength \u03bb to the +1 diffraction order. Electromagnetic simulations are performed for topology optimization using rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA), also known as the Fourier modal method, on a personal computer and plot the time used to optimize a full device as a function of its width L in FIG. 1C. The simulation time scales approximately as (L2.4), corresponding to the general scaling trend for electromagnetic solvers that utilize standard matrix multiplication and inversion algorithms. These trends show that prohibitively large computational resources are used to directly optimize devices many times larger than the wavelength.",

The total computation time scales as (d2.4\u00b7L/d)=(d1.4\u00b7L), which is linear as a function of total size. This expression also shows that computation time generally decreases with decreasing section size. In practice, it is found that using 3\u03bb-wide sections minimizes the total computation time, as the benefits from using smaller sections are outweighed by computational overhead in the electromagnetic solver. The computation time for a metasurface that has been optimized is plotted using 3\u03bb-wide sections in FIG. 1C. The observed reduction in computation time allows us to optimize devices with dimensions many times larger than the wavelength using realistic computational resources. For example, with the disclosed method, millimeter-scale topology-optimized metasurfaces operating at near-infrared wavelengths can be produced in less than one day using a personal computer. In contrast, optimizing the full device at once would take nearly one year and may use intractably large amounts of memory.",
