                        "Cancer genomes often contain fusion genes, created after structural chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, deletions, and inversion. Fusion genes are typically found in haematological cancers. So far, fusion genes have been found only rarely associated with solid tumours, in contrast to detection of numerous genomic copy number imbalances. However, recent reports have shown that fusion transcripts may prove to be a common contributor also to the development of solid tumours (Mitelman et al., 2007, Teixeira, 2006, Tomlins et al., 2005). The main problem has been the technological limitations for detection of fusion genes in solid tumours.",
                        "Identification of certain fusion genes are currently performed for differential diagnosis or therapeutic decision-making in haematological cancers and some rare solid tumour types. At present, routine diagnostics laboratories use laborious and inefficient analyses for detection of fusion genes in clinical samples. The tests are typically cytogenetic chromosome analyses (karyotyping\u2014usually by Giemsa banding) and/or RT-PCR of a selection of the most common fusion genes covering the most common break points for the individual novel transcript. To obtain metaphase chromosomes for karyotyping, a considerable amount of fresh tissue material is required, which also need to contain living and dividing cells. This methodology is also time consuming and labour intensive, and yet only has a success rate of about 70 percent. Furthermore, it is necessary to have highly experienced and competent personnel to examine the chromosomes visually, providing subjective results that also are at low-resolution. RT-PCR is a focused method, enabling analysis of one or a few candidate fusion genes at the time, at pre-defined fusion break points within them. The major limitation of this method is that it is not genome-wide, and thus a negative finding is not conclusive."

                                "There have been a few reports trying to identify predetermined fusion genes by oligo microarrays targeting specific junction sequences. These relied on a preceding step with amplification of the probes by RT-PCR, specifically targeting a small selection of predefined fusion genes and individual junction sequences therein. Similarly, junction oligos between exons in the same gene have been used for detection of alternative splicing.",
                                "Nasedkina et al., 2002, used multiplex RT-PCR followed by microarrays for identification of PCR products containing specific fusion transcripts. Their microarray contained probes for detection of up to two fusion variants of each of four well-known fusion genes. PCR amplification was performed as a nested two-round multiplex reaction with specific primers. Thus, their method and microarrays was designed for identification of only a few predetermined gene fusions.",
                                "Nasedkina et al., 2003 expanded on the above findings to include probes targeting one additional fusion gene, and 247 cases of childhood leukaemia were screened. Again, the authors only aimed at identification of predetermined fusion genes, more specifically fusion genes of clinical relevance for childhood leukaemia.",
                                "Shi et al., 2003 used multiplex RT-PCR for amplification of seven fusion genes and subsequently used oligo microarrays to identify the PCR product, i.e. oligos targeting one or two sites per fusion gene. As with Nasedkina et al., 2002, Nasedkina et al., 2003, their analysis was limited to a rather small number of predetermined fusion genes that are known to have an association with leukaemia. The authors claim that their method is quantitative, as opposed to the method of Nasedkina et al., 2002, Nasedkina et al., 2003. Further, Shi et al., 2003 mention on page 1069 that \u201cAlthough multiplex RT-PCR with 10-20 primer pairs was ideal, our preliminary data indicated that multiplex RT-PCR with primer pairs in excess of 20 was achievable with substantial assay optimization effort. However, the probability that formation of non-specific PCR products and primer-dimers would increase with increasing numbers of primers limited the maximum number of primer pairs\u201d. Thus, they acknowledge an unmet demand for higher throughput of the analysis and suggest that more than one multiplex RT-PCR can be devised to encompass more than 40 fusion transcripts. Further, the authors on page 1072 mention that \u201cBecause some of the translocation fusion splice junction sites may be a few kilobases distant from the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail on the mRNA, use of microarray assay alone is not possible at this stage because the reverse transcriptase is unable to generate cDNA long enough to reach the fusion splice-junction site\u201d. In other words, sequence specific RT-PCR is necessary for the assay to function, which in turn limits the throughput of the method for the reasons mentioned above.",

For all genes, and all their transcripts, the exon sequences were retrieved. We used the www.biomart.org internet portal. For each fusion gene combination, end sequences (the last 30 nucleotides) of all GeneA exons and start-sequences (30 nt) of all GeneB exons were joined at all combinations. Next, an oligo design algorithm was used to create probes (oligos) from each of these possible fusion gene exon-to-exon junctions. We have here used Tm optimally at 68 Celsius, and with equalized Tm from each side of the junction. In our example, we have generated exon-to-exon junction probes (oligos) ranging 33 to 46 nucleotides in length.",

These are sets of probes (oligos) measuring expression levels along the transcripts for the individual fusion gene partners. Three probes (oligos) were generated targeting internally to each exon sequence, at the start, mid, and end, and probes (oligos) were also generated targeting the intragenic exon-to-exon junctions. Exon-to-intron junctions and intron-to-exon junctions were also included as the pre-mRNA processing machinery may alter the splicing pattern following removal or introduction of cis-acting splicing regulatory sequences.",

Because of the short sequences on each side of the junction, the binding may be sensitive to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Thus, at known SNP-positions, we created extra sets of probes, accounting for each of the SNP variants. We also generated a second version of the array with longer probes (oligos) (44-55mers).",

From these, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed with use of random primers (hexamers), and double stranded cDNA was made and shipped to Nimblegen Inc. for labelling, hybridisation, washing, and scanning of microarrays.

All six samples had clear patterns of fusion genes, and thus validating the concept.",
                                "To evaluate the variability of a given fusion gene, we used the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in prostate cancer as a model. Here, we analyzed malignant prostate tissue samples from four individual tumours. FIG. 2 shows the results obtained from one of these samples. The leftmost picture in FIG. 2 shows the results obtained from hybridisation with the chimeric exon-to-exon probes. The individual exons of the TMPRSS2 and the ERG genes are depicted along the X- and Y-axis, respectively and the amount of sample hybridised to the chimeric exon-to-exon probes are visualized by the shading density. From this picture it can be seen that there is a strong density from the chimeric probes corresponding to TMPRSS2 exon 1 and ERG exon 4. This indicates existence of a TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene which is fused between TMPRSS2 exon 1 and ERG exon 4 in the sample material. The rightmost graph in FIG. 2 shows the expression level of the individual exons of the ERG gene as detected with the intragenic ERG probes. As seen from this graph the average expression level of exons 1-3 is lower than that of exons 4-11 indicating that the ERG gene is expressed as a fusion gene and that only exons 4-11 of the gene are included in the fusion transcript. Hence, the results obtained with the chimeric and intragenic probes are in concordance, and in combination they provide strong evidence that the prostate cancer sample comprises a TMPRSS2:ERG gene where the fusion junction is between exon 1 of TMPRSS2 and exon 4 of ERG. By cDNA sequencing, we have also confirmed this exact fusion junction at the nucleotide level (data not shown).",
                                "As seen in FIG. 2 the results obtained with the chimeric probes shows also, although weaker, signal intensities at other spots than the spot from TMPRSS2 exon 1 and ERG exon 4. These are e.g. those from TMPRSS2 exon 1 to ERG exon 1, and from TMPRSS2 exon 2 to ERG exon 2. However, we see that these candidate fusion junctions are not reflected by the longitudinal profile of ERG. Thus, this illustrates how inclusion of intragenic probes (oligos) reduces the likelihood of scoring false positives.",
                                "FIG. 3 shows the results that were obtained and the data are similar to those described with regard to FIG. 2. The results obtained with the chimeric probes are shown in the top picture while the results obtained with the intragenic probes towards the exons of TCF3 and PBX1 are shown in the left and right bottom graphs of the figure. By plotting their intensities according to exon numbers of the up- or downstream fusion gene partner (left and right bottom graph), we see the same picture as obtained with the chimeric exon-to-exon probes (top picture). The longitudinal profiles (obtained with the intragenic probes) support on the existence of the same fusion break points as detected with the chimeric probes; i.e. that the TCF3:PBX1 fusion gene in this cell line contains exons 1-15 of TCF3 fused to exons 4-8 of PBX1. Furthermore, cDNA sequencing from this cell line validated that the fusion transcript break point determined by the fusion gene microarray was correct down to the single nucleotide level.",

To date, 21 types of translocations involving RUNX1 have been reported, and 12 partner genes have been cloned and identified (14). One of the samples analyzed here, the REH cell line, carried an ETV6:RUNX1 fusion gene. This was detected similarly as described above for the TMPRSS2:ERG and TCF3:PBX1 genes by using chimeric exon-to-exon probes and intragenic probes targeting the exons of the ETV6 gene. The data showed that REH cell line contained an ETV6:RUNX1 fusion gene where the end of exon 5 of the ETV6 gene was fused to the beginning of exon 2 of the RUNX1 gene.",

For these analyses, a fusion score, calculated from the normalised value from the chimeric probe, is multiplied with probabilities of a fusion breakpoint at the up- or downstream fusion gene partners, as seen from their longitudinal profiles.",

Similarly, when probabilities for a breakpoint in the longitudinal profiles were <0.10, these values were set to 0.10. When the values from the downstream fusion gene partner exons were lower than the values from the upstream fusion gene partner exons, the probability was as well set to 0.10."
