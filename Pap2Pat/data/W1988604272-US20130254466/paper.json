    "title": "Rank-modulation rewriting codes for flash memories",
    "date": "2013-07-01",
    "abstract": "Current flash memory technology is focused on cost minimization of the stored capacity. However, the resulting approach supports a relatively small number of write-erase cycles. This technology is effective for consumer devices (smart-phones and cameras) where the number of write-erase cycles is small, however, it is not economical for enterprise storage systems that require a large number of lifetime writes. Our proposed approach for alleviating this problem consists of the efficient integration of two key ideas: (i) improving reliability and endurance by representing the information using relative values via the rank modulation scheme and (ii) increasing the overall (lifetime) capacity of the flash device via rewriting codes, namely, performing multiple writes per cell before erasure. We propose a new scheme that combines rank-modulation with rewriting. The key benefits of the new scheme include: (i) the ability to store close to 2 bits per cell on each write, and rewrite the memory close to q times, where q is the number of levels in each cell, and (ii) efficient encoding and decoding algorithms that use the recently proposed polar WOM codes.",

                "The application of the rank-modulation scheme for flash memories was proposed by Jiang et al. in [10]. The main idea of this modulation scheme is to represent the information by the relative levels of the flash memory cells, rather than by their absolute levels. Given a set of flash cells with distinct levels, the levels induce a permutation, which represents the stored data. The motivation for the scheme comes from the physical and architectural properties of flash memories. While injecting charge into a flash cell is a simple operation, removing it can by done only by the removal of the entire charge from a large block of cells, a process called block erasure. In conventional Multi-Level Cell (MLC) flash systems, the information is represented by the quantization of the cells' levels. Since the charge injection operation is a noisy process, it is often done iteratively, in order to avoid undesired block erasures in case of overshoots. It was suggested in [10] that the rank-modulation scheme speeds up data writing by eliminating the over-shooting problem in flash memories. In addition, it also increases the data retention by mitigating the effect of charge leakage. A hardware implementation of the scheme was recently designed to demonstrate those properties [12].",
                "The work on rank modulation coding for flash memories paved the way for additional results in this area. First, errorcorrecting codes in the rank modulation setup attracted a lot of attention; see e.g. [2], [7], [11], [16]. In addition, other variations of rank modulation were proposed and studied, such as [6], [17].",
                "In this work we focus on the notion of rewriting codes, that were proposed for the rank-modulation scheme in [10], in order to reuse the memory between block erasures. Since block erasures are slow, power consuming and are reducing the device reliability, it is desirable to minimize their usage. This is especially important in applications that require a large number of writes, such as enterprise storage systems. In order to minimize block erasures, the proposed approach is to rewrite the memory without erasing it, by injecting charge to the cells such that they induce a desired new permutation, and thus represent a new user message. After a number of rewriting cycles, the cells reach their maximal level, and block erasure is unavoidable. The aim of rewriting codes is to maximize the number of writes between block erasures.",
                "In rank-modulation, each cell has a certain rank, according to its relative level in the permutation. Depending on the resolution of charge detection and the noise magnitude, a certain gap is needed between cells of adjacent rank, to avoid errors. Therefore, it was proposed in [4] to use a discrete model for the design and analysis of rewriting codes, despite the fact that the information is only based on the relative analog levels of the cells. The approach taken in [4] is to focus, in every rewrite, on the difference between the levels of the top cell in the permutation, before and after the rewrite. This difference is defined as the cost of rewrite. The reason for this focus is that writing with high cost gets the memory closer to the point where block erasure is required. Under this model, the goal of this work is to design codes that guarantee that, in every rewrite, the cost is at most 1. That way, the code supports a large number of writes before block erasure. It was shown in [4] that codes with worst-case cost of 1 allows the writing of at most 1 bit per cell in each writing cycle.",
                "A further generalization of the model was proposed in [5]. In this model, the cells need to induce a permutation of a given multiset. That is, each rank is occupied by a pre-determined number of cells, according to a specific multiset. For that model, it was shown in [5] that code with cost 1 can store up to 2 bits per cell in each cycle. Notice that this generalization doubles the amount of information storage for codes with cost 1. In addition, the generalization allows the rate to approach that of the non-binary write-once-memory model [8], when the number of writes and cell levels is high. In this work, we design rewriting codes with cost 1, that allow the writing of nearly 2 bits per cell in each cycle, and thus approach the limit of the model. Our construction takes advantage of the recently discovered polar codes, which were recently used in the construction of write-once-memory codes in [3].",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we formally present the problem we study in this paper. In section III we give a background on polar WOM codes that serve in our construction. Section IV describes our construction of rank modulation codes. Finally, in section V, we give some concluding remarks."

Nonetheless, we only present here the case of a single write to the memory, where the initial state already has cells with values of '1'. Assume that a user wishes to store information in the memory, where the encoder knowns the initial state of the memory, while the decoder doesn't. We further assume that there is no noise in the model. Let s \u2208 {0, 1} N be the initial cell-state, and let p be the fraction of 1's in s. That is, p = w(s)/N, where w(s) is the number of 1's in s. In addition, assume that a user wishes to store the message a \u2208 {0, 1} k . Note that in the case that the decoder knows the initial state s, the communication rate of the memory is R = k/n = p. Therefore, when the decoder doesn't know s, the rate cannot exceed p.

Therefore, the key point in designing these encoding functions is to observe the similarity to the WOM problem that was described in section III. However, there is an important difference between the WOM problem and our problem of encoding a single rank. While in a WOM code there is no significance to the number of cells that are written, in our codes we seek to write such that exactly z i of the cells will remain in level zero. Our approach to tackle that difference is to add extra redundancy cells in order to make the number of written cells exactly z i w.h.p.. The number of redundancy cells is kept small, such that the rate can still be arbitrarily close to the capacity of the memory. While the number of redundancy cells can be made small, we still keep them as part of the cells in the multipermutation. That is, we still want to have a predefined number of cells in each rank.

In rank i, for each index of a flipped cell we want to store, we assign n \u2032 redundancy cells, where half of them are in rank i, and the other half in rank i + 1.",

The construction allows to write arbitrary message with cost 1, where the rate is asymptotically optimal. There are several open problems that can improve the understanding of the proposed scheme. First, it is of interest to determine the relation between the rate and the number of cells. In order to determine this, it is required to characterize the relation between the rate of polar codes and the number of subchannels. In addition, the design of error correcting codes for this scheme is a broad open problem. A related attempt for the WOM model is proposed in [9]."
