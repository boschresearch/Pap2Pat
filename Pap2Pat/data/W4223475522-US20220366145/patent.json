    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is a task in natural language processing. The embodiments are directed to using a generative language model to extract an aspect term, aspect category and their corresponding polarities. The generative language model may be trained as a single, joint, and multi-task model. The single-task generative language model determines a term polarity from the aspect term in the sentence or a category polarity from an aspect category in the sentence. The joint-task generative language model determines both the aspect term and the term polarity or the aspect category and the category polarity. The multi-task generative language model determines the aspect term, term polarity, aspect category and category polarity of the sentence.",

                        "Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis is typically characterized in three categories: document, sentence, and aspect level. Conventional pre-trained language models are often used to achieve state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is also common to fine-tune the pre-trained language models on the downstream tasks, usually by adding task-specific layers on top of the models.",
                        "Sentiment analysis aims at detecting the overall polarity of a user generated text, which describes the user opinion for an entity. However, user may express opinion about an entity at different granularity. For example, a user may give an overall rate about a restaurant service, and then explain in fine-grained review specific aspects, such as food quality, waiting time, waitress service, environment, etc. Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims at addressing this task. To do so, the user sentiment is annotated at coarse and fine-grained levels. Moreover, a user can express conflicting opinions for different aspects of the same entity.",
                        "Conventionally, deep learning models applied to aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks, were employed as a single task model, similar to the machine reading comprehension task (MRC). For example, a pre-trained BERT language model is fine-tuned on ABSA term polarity prediction (single task) as a classifier. In this approach, a task-specific layer is fine-tuned on a downstream task, such as a layer for aspect term polarity classification, and a different layer for aspect term span extraction.",
                        "Conventional works on the ABSA task focused on developing feature engineered models. One model may be based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for aspect term extraction task only. This approach is based on using two types of pre-trained embeddings, a general-purpose embedding and a domain-specific embedding. Then, a softmax classification layer is used to classify each word that identifies aspect term start and end positions, or non-related words.",
                        "Another conventional model is a multi-granularity alignment network (MGAN). This is a coarse-to-fine approach for single-task aspect polarity prediction using recurrent neural network (RNN). This approach defines aspect category as a coarse-level and aspect term as fine-level sentiments. MGAN further leverages high-resource out-of-domain data for pre-training. In this way, the knowledge is transferred from the coarse-grain domain (single-opinion prediction) to multi-grain domains (ABSA task).",
                        "Another conventional model is the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. Bert is a pretrained bidirectional language model for language understanding and which presents a powerful contextualized word representation for downstream tasks. BERT may be used for feature extraction in the ABSA task. For example, the review reading comprehension (RRC) model defines the ABSA task as question answering, uses BERT as base model, with different heads for aspect term extraction (as span extraction) and term polarity prediction. To enhance the RRC performance, the RRC model uses a post-training algorithm. The post-training algorithm may additionally pre-train the model on the out-of-domain data from various datasets, such as Amazon and Yelp review datasets, and additionally on MRC question answering dataset.",
                        "Another approach is based on a conditional random field (CRF) combined with BERT for aspect term extraction and term polarity prediction. The two modules are employed for improving aspect term extraction and term polarity prediction of the BERT model. First, a parallel approach is used which combines predictions for aspect term and polarity from the last four layers of BERT in a parallel way. Moreover, a hierarchical aggregation module is also examined, where predictions of previous layers of BERT are fed into the next layer.",
                        "Another approach combines the GLOVE pre-trained embedding with deep contextualized representation of BERT to enhance word representation vector for predicting aspect term polarity. The proposed BERT-IL model predicts aspect term polarity by learning similarity between the GLOVE representation vector of aspect term and its contextualized representation extracted from BERT. In the approach, first the aspect term representations are extracted from multiple layers of BERT, followed by a self-attention layer. Then, the BERT-IL is further fine-tuned on ABSA task for better performance.",

The GPT2 model uses the causal language modeling loss to predict the next word given the history. Using this approach, the generative language model learns a downstream task as language generation. The downstream task is represented as a serialized text. A generative language model, such as GPT3 model, is a large-scale language model with a few-shot ability.

In some embodiments, a training example from aspect category dataset, may include a concatenation of a review sentence, such as sentence 150, aspect category 214 and category polarity 216, which may be represented as xk=[Sk; Ck].

By reformulating the ABSA task 140 as a language generation task, the ABSA generative language model 130 learns to predict aspects and their expressed opinion via language generation. Evaluation results on a single-task polarity prediction on few and full shot setting indicates that the proposed approach outperforms conventional models, which are based on discriminative classification using a BERT as encoder. On join-task (aspect term and term polarity task, or aspect category and category polarity task) and multi-task (aspect term, term polarity, aspect category prediction, and category polarity tasks), the proposed model shows better performance on single-task polarity prediction. Moreover, qualitative analysis indicates that using language generation on multi task setting improve the model prediction using supervision across aspect term and aspect category.",
