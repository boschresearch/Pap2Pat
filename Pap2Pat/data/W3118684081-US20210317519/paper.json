    "title": "Subtraction-free and bisulfite-free specific sequencing of 5-methylcytosine and its oxidized derivatives at base resolution",
    "date": "2021-01-27",
    "abstract": "Although various methods have been developed for sequencing cytosine modifications, it is still challenging for specific and quantitative sequencing of individual modification at base-resolution. For example, to obtain both true 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and true 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) information, the two major epigenetic modifications, it usually requires subtraction of two methods, which increases noise and requires high sequencing depth. Recently, we developed TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS) for bisulfite-free direct sequencing of 5mC and 5hmC. Here we demonstrate that two sister methods, TAPS\u03b2 and chemical-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (CAPS), can be effectively used for subtraction-free and specific whole-genome sequencing of 5mC and 5hmC, respectively. We also demonstrate pyridine borane sequencing (PS) for whole-genome profiling of 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, the further oxidized derivatives of 5mC and 5hmC. This work completes the set of versatile borane reduction chemistry-based methods as a comprehensive toolkit for direct and quantitative sequencing of all four cytosine epigenetic modifications.",

                "The primary DNA sequence of the four-letter alphabets G, C, A, and T forms the genetic information of life on earth. Chemical modifications of DNA bases do not change the underlying sequence, but instead carry an extra layer of information. The first discovered 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most studied modified base, and it plays crucial roles in a broad range of biological processes from gene regulation to normal development1 and is regarded as the fifth base. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is converted from 5mC by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases2; it is enriched in neuronal cells3 and regarded as the sixth base. Further successive TET oxidation results in 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)4,5, which exist at much lower abundances in the mammalian genome and are regarded as intermediates in the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-base excision repair (BER) active demethylation pathway5. Emerging evidence indicates the stability of these DNA demethylation intermediates6 as well as potential functional roles7.",
                "Detection and analysis of cytosine modifications has been an intriguing challenge for chemists as well as other scientists. Traditionally, bisulfite sequencing (BS) has been the gold standard for base-resolution and quantitative analysis of 5mC and 5hmC8. Modified BS has also been developed for specific sequencing of 5mC (oxidative bisulfite sequencing, oxBS-seq)9 or 5hmC (TET-assisted bisulfite sequencing, TAB-seq)10. These methods, however, all involve harsh bisulfite treatment, which degrades up to 99% of the DNA11, and reduces sequence complexity by converting unmodified cytosine (~95% of the total cytosine in the human genome) to thymine (T). Recently, bisulfite-free quantitative base-resolution methods have emerged and showed significant advantages over BS12. Among them, APOBEC-coupled epigenetic sequencing (ACE-seq, which detects 5hmC)13 and Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq, which detects 5mC\u2009+\u20095hmC)14 use an enzymatic deamination step to replace the bisulfite deamination step. While these methods solve the DNA damage issue, they still suffer from the indirect detection issue of BS by converting unmodified cytosine to T. Recently, we developed TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS) based on a pyridine borane reductive decarboxylation and deamination chemistry15,16. In TAPS, 5mC and 5hmC are oxidized by TET proteins to 5caC and reduced to dihydrouracil (DHU) by pyridine borane. DHU is then amplified and sequenced as T during sequencing. TAPS is nondestructive and detects 5mC\u2009+\u20095hmC directly, and it shows improved sequence quality, mapping rate, and coverage compared to BS15.",
                "5mC and 5hmC provide distinct and antagonistic epigenetic information: 5mC usually marks repressed genes and 5hmC generally marks expressed genes17. To elucidate the interplay between 5mC and 5hmC in various biological processes, it is necessary to distinguish the two modifications. To do that, two assays (e.g. BS and oxBS-seq, BS and TAB-seq, or EM-Seq and ACE-seq) need to be performed and a subtraction between the two assays is usually required to obtain both the true 5mC and true 5hmC information (e.g. BS minus oxBS-seq to get 5hmC, BS minus TAB-seq to get 5mC, or EM-Seq minus ACE-seq to get 5mC)9,10,13. However, subtraction may introduce negative values because of random sampling or systematic error in each experiment and suffer from accumulation of noise from multiple assays, which increases the need for higher sequencing depth18 as well as more effort to perform read filtering and apply statistical tests19. A subtraction-free approach where two assays (e.g. oxBS-seq and TAB-seq) can read out the true 5mC and true 5hmC information directly is desirable. However, so far, no bisulfite-free methods have been shown to deliver that. Previously, we demonstrated the proof-of-principle that the versatility of the borane reduction chemistry for direct and quantitative sequencing of individual cytosine modification on model DNA with Sanger sequencing15. In this study, we further optimize and demonstrate these methods for whole-genome applications, including TAPS with \u03b2-glucosyltransferase (\u03b2GT) blocking (TAPS\u03b2) and chemical-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (CAPS) for whole-genome subtraction-free 5mC-specific and 5hmC-specific sequencing, respectively; and pyridine borane sequencing (PS) for whole-genome sequencing of 5fC and 5caC."

                        "To realize 5mC-specific sequencing, we used \u03b2GT, which is widely used for selective labeling of 5hmC with glucose that enables 5hmC pull-down20 and protection from TET oxidation10 or APOBEC deamination13. We utilized this simple and robust reaction to block 5hmC and then performed TET oxidation and borane reduction on 5mC (Fig.\u00a01a)15. We applied TAPS\u03b2 on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) genomic DNA (gDNA) and validated with spike-in controls with known modifications by high-throughput sequencing. High 5mC conversion rate (97.6% in CpG-methylated lambda DNA, Fig.\u00a01b) and low false-positive rate (0.24% conversion rate on unmodified C, Fig.\u00a01c) were achieved in TAPS\u03b2, which are close to previous TAPS results (96.5% and 0.23%, respectively)15. 5hmC showed only 1.9% conversion rate in TAPS\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a01b) compared to 89.1% in TAPS15. The other two minor cytosine modifications 5fC and 5caC also showed high conversion rate (84.9% and 94.4% respectively, Supplementary Table\u00a01); however, they were ignored in following data analysis due to the negligible amounts existed in the mammalian genome (<0.002% of total cytosine)4. Similar to TAPS15, TAPS\u03b2 showed excellent sequencing quality scores at cytosine/guanine (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). We observed good correlation between TAPS\u03b2 and published 5mC data of mESCs by reduced representation oxBS-seq (RRoxBS-seq)21 (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009=\u20090.77, Fig.\u00a01d) and whole-genome oxBS-seq22 (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009=\u20090.72, Fig.\u00a01e). In comparison, Pearson correlation coefficients between the reported four RRoxBS-seq replicates were 0.79\u20130.80 (ref. 21). The discrepancy between TAPS\u03b2 and oxBS-seq is likely caused by biological differences, e.g. cell line passages9, rather than systematic bias, given the high correlation between TAPS and TAPS\u03b2 using the same biological sample (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). TAPS\u03b2 showed much improved sequencing quality evidenced by higher mapping rate (90.7%, Supplementary Table\u00a02) than RRoxBS-seq21 (66.2\u201368.2%) and oxBS-seq22 (21.4\u201326.1%). Notably, TAPS\u03b2 is the first and only bisulfite-free, base-resolution, and quantitative 5mC-specific sequencing method.Fig. 1TAPS\u03b2 for bisulfite-free 5mC-specific sequencing.a Schematic demonstration of TAPS\u03b2. b Conversion rates of TAPS\u03b2 at known 5mCG or 5hmCG positions from CpG-methylated lambda DNA or synthetic spike-in. c False-positive rate of TAPS\u03b2 from 2-kb-unmodified spike-in. d Correlation analysis between TAPS\u03b2 and published RRoxBS-seq dataset at CpGs with the minimal depth of 10.

                        "To enable 5hmC-specific sequencing, we turned to chemical oxidization of 5hmC to 5fC, which can also be converted to DHU by borane reduction (Fig.\u00a02a). In our proof-of-principle study, we used potassium perruthenate (KRuO4) previously used in oxBS-seq as the oxidant, which is known to cause DNA damage9. In this study, we utilized potassium ruthenate (K2RuO4), which was used in chemical-assisted C-to-T conversion of 5hmC sequencing (hmC-CATCH) and reported to be more oxidative and less DNA damaging than KRuO4 (ref. 23). We optimized the K2RuO4 oxidation protocol for CAPS as follows: (1) Commonly used double-strand DNA library preparation method was applied instead of the complicated single-strand protocol. (2) A uracil-containing loop-structured NEBNext Adaptor was used in the DNA ligation. Subsequent treatment with USER enzyme (a mix of UDG and Endo VIII) opened the loop, leaving 3\u02b9 and 5\u02b9 phosphate ends that could protect the ligated DNA from oxidative damaging24. (3) Double oxidation was performed on the ligated DNA by adding additional oxidant to the original oxidation reaction, improving the conversion rate of 5hmC to 5fC from 82.8% to 97.2% measured by HPLC-MS/MS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). A limitation of both KRuO4 and K2RuO4 oxidation is that they only work on single-strand DNA. Pyridine borane used in TAPS, which is optimized based on double-strand DNA, only showed 65.8% 5hmC-to-T conversion rate on single-strand DNA while 1.3% C-to-T false-positive rate was observed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Instead, we found that another compound, 2-methylpyridine borane (pic-borane), achieved 83.1% 5hmC-to-T conversion rate (Fig.\u00a02b) and 0.72% false-positive rate on single-strand DNA (Fig.\u00a02c), and therefore was chosen as the reducing agent for CAPS. These numbers are similar to the 5hmC-to-T conversion rate and false-positive rate reported in hmC-CATCH (~80% (without pull-down) and 0.6\u20131%, respectively)23.Fig. 2CAPS for bisulfite-free 5hmC-specific sequencing.a Schematic demonstration of CAPS. b Conversion rates of CAPS at known 5mCG or 5hmCG positions from CpG-methylated lambda DNA or synthetic spike-in. c False-positive rate of CAPS from 2-kb-unmodified spike-in. d Fraction of all sequenced read pairs in CAPS and ACE-seq mapped to the reference mouse genome. e Correlation density plot between CAPS, TAB-seq, and ACE-seq in 10-kb bins.

                        "Next, we applied CAPS on mESCs and detected 1,762,287 5hmC-modified sites. We compared CAPS with the other two whole-genome base-resolution 5hmC sequencing methods: TAB-seq10 and ACE-seq13, using published sequencing data from mESCs. Both TAB-seq and ACE-seq utilize \u03b2GT to protect 5hmC with a glucose from bisulfite or enzymatic deamination and read it\u00a0as C after PCR amplification, while converting both unmodified C and 5mC to T. Bisulfite-based TAB-seq shares the same drawbacks as BS, while ACE-seq partially solves the problem by replacing the harsh chemical reaction with mild APOBEC3A enzymatic deamination. However, ACE-seq still suffers from reduced sequence complexity in the converted genome, which results in low mapping rate (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Table\u00a02), low base quality (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), and uneven coverage (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). The low base quality in ACE-seq is caused by the unbalanced CG content in the sequencing libraries similar to WGBS15, while CAPS avoids depletion of cytosines leading to optimal data quality similar to TAPS and TAPS\u03b2. CAPS outperformed TAB-seq and ACE-seq in these sequencing metrics (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Table\u00a02), while showing good correlation with published dataset (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009=\u20090.79 with TAB-seq and 0.67 with ACE-seq, Fig.\u00a02e). On the other hand, 5hmC obtained from TAPS\u2212TAPS\u03b2 subtraction showed an abnormal distribution of modification levels with lower correlation (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009=\u20090.54 with TAB-seq and 0.40 with ACE-seq, Fig.\u00a02f), demonstrating that the subtraction-free method is superior for 5hmC profiling, especially given that 5hmC exists in much lower abundance than 5mC in most non-neuronal tissues and cell lines4, including mESCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a).",
                        "To globally benchmark different methods by accounting for 5mC and 5hmC states in mESCs, we established the abundance of both modifications (Fig.\u00a03a). Combination of TAPS\u03b2 and CAPS showed a similar pattern to whole-genome BS (WGBS) with TAB-seq or ACE-seq while TAPS\u2212TAPS\u03b2 subtraction overestimated 5hmC sites. Examples were plotted to show results from different approaches, demonstrating that CAPS detected consistent 5hmC sites with TAB-seq and ACE-seq (Fig.\u00a03b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). The distribution of 5hmC varied across genomic regulatory elements (Fig.\u00a03c)25\u201327, with particular enrichment at enhancers and insulators28, where CTCF-binding sites were enriched (Fig.\u00a03d). This result is consistent with previous findings that 5hmCs are enriched in enhancers and CTCF-binding sites10,23.Fig. 3Comparison of CAPS with other methods.a Comparison of 5mC and 5hmC levels tiled by 1-kb bins for TAPS\u03b2, CAPS, ACE-seq, and TAB-seq.

                        "To study the active demethylation pathway, various BS-based21,29\u201331 and bisulfite-free32 methods have also been developed to profile 5fC and/or 5caC modifications. The borane reduction chemistry can be used for direct sequencing of 5fC and 5caC, where 5fC and 5caC are converted to DHU by pyridine borane and read as T after PCR amplification (PS, Fig.\u00a04a). We applied this simple approach to the same mESCs gDNA and demonstrated high conversion rate in 5caC spike-in (93.8%, Fig.\u00a04b) and good conversion rate in 5fC spike-in (76.8%). The low false-positive rate (0.27%, Fig.\u00a04c) in PS lowered the requirement for sequencing depth to distinguish the low abundant 5fC/5caC signals from the background33. We also developed a method for 5caC-specific sequencing in which 5fC was blocked by O-ethylhydroxylamine29 before borane reduction reaction, which we termed pyridine borane sequencing for 5caC (PS-c, Fig.\u00a04a). PS-c achieved a low conversion rate of 15.2% on 5fC (Fig.\u00a04d) while the high conversion rate on 5caC (95.3%) and the low false-positive rate (0.22%, Fig.\u00a04e) were not affected. Even with the low false-positive rates of PS and PS-c, it remains challenging to detect 5fC and 5caC in whole-genome sequencing due to their low level. Instead, we focused on regulatory regions27,34 and found that 5fC/5caC signals were enriched at H3K4me1, H3K4me3 regions (Fig.\u00a04f, g), promoters and enhancers compared to repressed regions or heterochromatin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08), which is consistent with previous enrichment-based 5fC sequencing result29. Our base-resolution data also revealed the 5fC/5caC modification on Nanog, a pluripotency regulator (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), which was previously reported based on an enrichment-based method32. These results suggest that PS can capture the genuine 5fC/5caC signals even in a low 5fC level sample.Fig. 4PS for bisulfite-free 5fC/5caC-specific sequencing.a Schematic demonstration of PS and PS-c. b Conversion rate of PS at known 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC positions in spike-in controls. c False-positive rate of PS from 2-kb-unmodified spike-in. d Conversion rate of PS-c at known 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC positions in spike-in controls. e False-positive rate of PS-c from 2-kb-unmodified spike-in. f, g Average 5fC/5caC signal in\u00a0the\u00a06-kb regions flanking the centers of H3K4me3 (f) and H3K4me1 (g) peaks\u00a0produced by the ENCODE Project Consortium.\u00a0On the x-axis, 0 denotes the peak center.",
                        "Bisulfite and various bisulfite-free methods are known to have systematic differences in sequencing due to different chemistries and detection mode (indirect vs direct)14,15. When comparing various modifications, it is therefore ideal to have them derived from the same family of methods to minimize bias. In this study, we present a suite of borane reduction chemistry-based methods for direct and quantitative sequencing of all four cytosine modifications in mESCs, providing a valuable resource for studying DNA modifications in the popular epigenetics model (Table\u00a01). By replacing harsh bisulfite treatment with mild borane reduction reaction, we achieved higher sequencing quality and more comprehensive methylome analysis. Independent identification of 5mC and 5hmC by subtraction-free TAPS\u03b2 and CAPS methods could provide insight into the distribution and function of the two modifications. The simple and mild borane reduction sequencing methods PS and PS-c could facilitate studies of the dynamics of active DNA demethylation processes. Together, they offer the most comprehensive solution for epigenetic sequencing of cytosine modifications.Table 1Base changes in borane reduction chemistry-based methods.BaseTAPSTAPS\u03b2CAPSPSPS-cCCCCCC5mCTTCCC5hmCTCTCC5fCTTTTC5caCTTTTTC-to-T transitions marked in bold were recognized as modified sites."
