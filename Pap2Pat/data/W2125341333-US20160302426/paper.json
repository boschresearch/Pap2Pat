    "abstract": "Pierce's Disease (PD) of grapevines, caused by Xylella fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa (Xf), is a limiting factor in the cultivation of grapevines in the US. There are presently no effective control methods to prevent or treat PD. The therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of a phage cocktail composed of four virulent (lytic) phages was evaluated for control of PD. Xf levels in grapevines were significantly reduced in therapeutically or prophylactically treated grapevines. PD symptoms ceased to progress one week post-therapeutic treatment and symptoms were not observed in prophylactically treated grapevines. Cocktail phage levels increased in grapevines in the presence of the host. No in planta phage-resistant Xf isolates were obtained. Moreover, Xf mutants selected for phage resistance in vitro did not cause PD symptoms. Our results indicate that phages have great potential for biocontrol of PD and other economically important diseases caused by Xylella.",

                "Pierce's Disease (PD) caused by the xylem-limited, gamma-proteobacterium Xylella fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa (Xf) [1], is a severe threat to the wine industry in the United States. Xf is transmitted by xylem sap-feeding insect vectors and colonizes the xylem vessels of host plants by movement through bordered pits to neighboring vessels. The formation of biofilms within the vessels results in plugging and disease [2]. Existing disease control methods are often only partially successful. Other than rouging of infected grapevines, the most widely used current practice relies on controlling the vectors through widespread application of systemic insecticides such as neonicotinoids that are absorbed by plants and transferred throughout the vascular system [3,4]. Neonicotinoids are neuro-active insecticides that derive their toxicity by acting mainly agonistically on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane [5,6,7]. The neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, is one of the most widely used insecticides in the world and is recommended for the control of the glassy winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulate), a major vector of Xf [3,5]. However, recent concerns of the role of neonicotinoids in honey bee colony collapse disorder [8] has resulted in a two year ban of three neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) by the European Commission because of the acute and chronic effects on bee colony survival and development [9]. In 2013, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a notification to registrants on registered pesticides containing imidacloprid, dinotefuran, clothianidin or thiamethoxam advising of strengthen pollinator protective labeling on neonicotinoid products [10].",
                "Clearly there is a need to develop alternative methods for control PD. Current approaches include the development of transgenic grapevines and rootstocks resistant to PD [11,12,13,14] and the use of avirulent Xf strains to protect susceptible grapevines [15]. We submit that the used of bacteriophages (phages) offers an environmentally-friendly, effective, and sustainable biocontrol method for PD.",
                "Phages are the most abundant and ubiquitous genetic entity on earth [16,17]. Besides ubiquity, two major properties of phages, specificity and exponential propagation, make them attractive as antibacterial agents. Specifically, a cocktail of phages exhibiting broad host range activity that reflects a diversity of receptors would maximize the potency of the treatment and minimize the possibility for development of resistance. Well-developed phage cocktails can act as a natural biocontrol for bacterial infections, targeting a pathogenic bacterium without affecting the animal or plant host or their commensal microflora. Guidelines to the development of phage-based biocontrol strategies are yet to be formalized but it is already generally accepted that temperate phages should not be candidates for therapeutic use because of their potential capacity for specialized or generalized transduction of pathogenesis determinants [18,19].",
                "In this study, a cocktail of phages previously shown to be incapable of lysogeny [20] was evaluated for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of PD in Vitis vinifera in greenhouse studies. Considering the practical application of the phage biocontrol system, we also addressed the potential for the development of phage-resistant mutants. This is the first report for the use of phages to treat or prevent PD of grapevines."

Moreover, prophylactically treated grapevines showed no PD symptoms at week 8 or 12 (data not shown). As above, the levels of cocktail phages were 10\u2013200 fold higher (P < 0.05) in prophylactically treated grapevines compared to cocktail only treated grapevines, and correlated with the prophylactic efficacy (S2A\u2013S2D Fig)."

                        "At the termination of both therapeutic and prophylactic greenhouse studies at week 12, extracts from grapevine segments from each treatment were plated to determine if surviving Xf-T1 isolates were resistant to cocktail phages. Plating of plant extracts from therapeutically or prophylactically treated grapevines yielded an average of 4 \u00d7 102 CFU/gt and 3 \u00d7 102 CFU/gt, respectively (Figs 3B and 6B, respectively). Representative isolates (20 ea.) from each cordon of each of three grapevines from both therapeutic and prophylactic treatments were confirmed as Xf and retained full sensitivity to the cocktail phages (data not shown).",
                        "Since phage-resistant Xf mutants were not found in planta, spontaneous Xf-T1 mutants resistant to each of the four cocktail phages were selected in vitro. All mutants (43 isolates) were confirmed as Xf to subspecies level by PCR and were resistant to all four cocktail phages (data not shown). Of eight representative phage-resistant Xf-T1 derivatives tested, only one XF15.51 had lost twitching motility (S1 Table and Fig 7). Analysis of the type IV pilus gene clusters of XF15.51 revealed an IS1327 (PD1333; NC_004556.1) insertion in codon 24 of pilQ (PD1691; AAO29529.1), which encodes a protein in the outer membrane complex required for the extrusion and retraction of type IV pili [25]. XF15.51 and two of the phage-resistant mutants that retained twitching motility (XF15.7 and XF15.11) exhibited an absolute adsorption defect for all four cocktail phages, whereas the adsorption rate constants for the four phages to the parental Xf-T1 were ~4 x 10\u221212 ml cell-1 min-1, as previously observed (data not shown) [20]. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the four cocktail phages share a requirement for both the type IV pilus, lacking in XF15.1 and an unidentified secondary receptor, defective in the other seven mutants. There was no detectable difference in the growth rate of the phage-resistant mutants as compared to the parental Xf-T1 strain in PW broth or solid medium (data not shown)."

Grapevines inoculated these derivatives (S1 Table) did not develop PD symptoms over a 12 week post-inoculation period, whereas grapevines inoculated with the parental strain (Xf-T1) exhibited typical PD symptoms by week 7\u20138 (data not shown). Triplicate grapevines inoculated with each mutant were segmented and each segment was assayed by qRT-PCR at week 4, 6, 8, and 10 post-inoculation. The non-motile XF15.51 did not exhibit movement in grapevines beyond the POI, since functional type IV pili are required for movement and virulence (data not shown) [26]. In contrast, the other phage-resistant Xf that retained twitching motility colonized and showed movement throughout the grapevines (~38 cm above and below the POI) similar to wild type (Xf-T1). This suggests the secondary receptor or receptors used by these phages are essential for virulence."

                "Presently, there are no effective control strategies for PD. The most widely used measure for control of PD is the application of neonicotinoid pesticides that have been reported to adversely affect the winterization of honey bee colonies and contributing to colony collapse disorder [8]. In June 2013, a mass die-off of native pollinators attributed to applications of neonicotinoid insecticides led Oregon state authorities to adopt permanent restrictions on dinotefuran and imidacloprid [27]. Not only do neonicotinoids pose a threat to pollinators, but also they have been found widely in fruits and vegetables and have shown excitatory effects on cultured cerebellar neurons from neonatal rats, suggesting possible neurotoxicity in developing mammalian brains [28,29].",
                "In this study, we demonstrated the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy for the application of a cocktail composed of four virulent (lytic) Xf phages. The phage cocktail reduced the pathogen levels in grapevines and prevented PD symptom development. This is the first report of the application of a phage-based biocontrol strategy for the control of PD and may offer an alternative to the use of broad-acting insecticides for the control of vector-transmitted plant diseases caused by Xylella species.",
                "The results show that the phages were able to be distributed in the grapevines after initial introduction, since they were detected in petioles 50 cm above the POI and in root systems 50 cm below the POI in grapevines treated only with phage. In the absence of the host, phage levels declined over a 12 week period (Fig 4). In contrast, in therapeutically and prophylactically treated grapevines phage levels increased 10\u2013200 fold (P < 0.05) when a permissive host was present (Fig 5 and S2 Fig). To our knowledge, this is the first report of distribution, persistence and multiplication of phages in a plant vascular system.",
                "A major concern regarding the use of phages as therapeutic agents is the development of phage resistance [18,30,31]. To address this concern, a therapeutic cocktail consisting of four lytic phages exhibiting differential host ranges was used in this study. In multiple in planta experiments, we have not detected phage-resistant mutants (data not shown). In fact, we have isolated phage from petioles of grapevines exhibiting PD symptoms [20]. Xf is known to persist in grapevines at low levels without causing disease [32], and thus the presence of Xf at low levels in the presence of low levels of phage would not be unexpected, since phage-host interactions depend on the concentrations of both viruses and cells [33]. However, phage-resistant derivatives obtained in vitro and tested in our system, were all avirulent, irrespective of retention of twitching motility. We have previously reported that the four cocktail phages are lytic and required the presence of type IV pili for adsorption [20]. It was therefore not unexpected to obtain phage-resistant mutants such as XF15.51, with an IS insertion in pilQ, and that these mutants would be avirulent in planta. However, all other phage-resistant mutants tested were also avirulent, despite the presence of functional type IV pili. This suggests that a secondary receptor is required for phage infection and that this secondary receptor is essential for virulence. Analysis of these mutants to identify the genes responsible is underway.",
                "The implementation of a phage-based biocontrol system composed of a cocktail of lytic phages is a strategy for the treatment or prevention of PD. Furthermore, the target specific nature of the cocktail phages for Xf is not harmful to humans, animals, plants or associated beneficial microflora. In vitro experiments confirmed that Xf subspecies causing almond [20], oleander [20] or coffee leaf scorch were sensitive to the four cocktail phages. The developed phages may offer a treatment for the olive-quick decline syndrome recently reported in Italy that is attributed to Xylella [34]. The application of phages as biocontrol agents not only offers the wine industry an effective and environmentally safe method to control PD in grapevines, but also has the potential to control other diseases caused by Xylella."
