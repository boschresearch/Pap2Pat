    "abstract": "Bacterial cyclic glucans are glucose polymers that concentrate within the periplasm of alpha-proteobacteria. These molecules are necessary to maintain the homeostasis of the cell envelope by contributing to the osmolarity of Gram negative bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that Brucella \u03b2 1,2 cyclic glucans are potent activators of human and mouse dendritic cells. Dendritic cells activation by Brucella \u03b2 1,2 cyclic glucans requires TLR4, MyD88 and TRIF, but not CD14. The Brucella cyclic glucans showed neither toxicity nor immunogenicity compared to LPS and triggered antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in vivo. These cyclic glucans also enhanced antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses including cross-presentation by different human DC subsets. Brucella \u03b2 1,2 cyclic glucans increased the memory CD4(+) T cell responses of blood mononuclear cells exposed to recombinant fusion proteins composed of anti-CD40 antibody and antigens from both hepatitis C virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus cyclic glucans represent a new class of adjuvants, which might contribute to the development of effective antimicrobial therapies.",

                "Cyclic glucans are intrinsic components of the envelopes of Gram negative bacteria such as Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Brucella spp. [1]. Brucellae are intracellular pathogens of mammals, including humans [2]. The pathogenesis of brucellosis is linked to the ability of Brucella to survive and replicate inside host cells [3] through the expression of several effector molecules [2]. In particular, the periplasmic cyclic glucan is required for B. abortus intracellular trafficking [4]\u2013[6] through the recruitment of the raft protein flotilin-1 at the site of the Brucella-containing vacuole [6]. This polysaccharide is built of a cyclic backbone of 17 to 25 glucose units in \u03b2-1,2 linkages (C\u03b2G). C\u03b2G are abundant as they represent 1\u20135% of the bacteria dry weight. If the C\u03b2G content of a single bacterium is released inside a Brucella-containing vacuole, its concentration in the vacuole can reach 10 mM. The release of C\u03b2G in \u00b5M concentration upon bacterial killing through immune mechanisms [6] might alter the host immune responses.",
                "While linear (1, 3) \u03b2-glucans have been shown to elicit anti-tumor [7], [8] and anti-infective [9]\u2013[12] responses [13], [14], we do not know whether C\u03b2G displays immunomodulatory functions. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of C\u03b2G on mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) and its consequences on immune responses.",
                "The discovery of vaccination is one of most important medical discoveries in the history and a turning point in the war between microbes and humans [15], [16]. The goal of vaccination is to induce long-lasting protective immunity from infection and prevent infectious diseases. Vaccines operate through the activation of antigen-presenting cells such as DC that eventually stimulate antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. Unlike attenuated live vaccines, killed whole organisms or subunit vaccines generally require the addition of adjuvants to be effective. Adjuvants promote and enhance immune responses to vaccine components [15], [16]. It is now clear that adjuvants activate DC [15]. Adjuvants derived from microorganisms stimulate DC directly, leading to the up-regulation of cytokines, MHC class II, and co-stimulatory molecules and to their migration to the T cell area of lymph nodes. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) activate pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which act as microbial sensors and are expressed by DC and other leukocytes [13], [14]. Most of PAMP used as vaccine adjuvants, like CpG oligonucleotides and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), are agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR) [17], [18]. For infectious as well as for noninfectious diseases, TLR activation have been used in both established and experimental vaccines [17], [18].",
                "Bacterial components are often potent immune activators trough commonly associated with toxicity, for example, bacterial DNA with immunostimulatory CpG motifs that bind TLR-9 are potent cellular adjuvants. Overall, several hundred natural and synthetic compounds have been identified to have adjuvant activity such as microbial products, mineral salts, emulsions, microparticles, and liposomes. Although many are more potent than alum, the almost universal human vaccine adjuvant, toxicity is the limiting step for their use in humans. Consequently there is a major unmet need for safer and more effective adjuvants suitable for human use [15]\u2013[17].",
                "We show here that Brucella C\u03b2G is neither toxic nor immunogenic when compared to LPS. It is a potent activator of DC thereby triggering antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. Brucella C\u03b2G enhance antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses including cross-presentation by different human DC subsets."

                        "Wild type B. abortus triggers limited activation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) [19]. Infection of BMDC with B. abortus cgs- (cyclic glucan synthase) mutant failed to activate BMDC as measured by the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 (Figure S1A and S1B). Likewise these infected DC displayed a low expression of immune co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83 and CD86 (not shown). This pilot findings led us hypothesize that C\u03b2G indeed acts as a DC activation molecule. To this end we had to ensure that the C\u03b2G preparations would not be contaminated by the potent DC activators LPS and lipid A. Whereas C\u03b2G are highly soluble in water, B. abortus and B. melitensis LPS partition in the phenol phase of the classical Westphal hot water-phenol extraction procedure. Thus, this extraction method was applied twice to a C\u03b2G water extract previously digested with nucleases and proteinase K. The identity of the C\u03b2G was established by several methods, including 13C-NMR, and the absence of LPS tested by both conventional analytical methods (SDS-PAGE, inability to elicit anti-LPS antibodies, and Kdo analysis). MALDI-TOF analysis further showed both the spectra expected from Brucella C\u03b2G and the absence of molecular species signalling like Brucella lipid A (Figure S2A and S2B)."

Brucella C\u03b2G consists of a cyclic backbone of 17\u201325 glucose residues linked in \u03b2-(1\u21922) associated with O-succinyl modifications [20], [21]. Ralstonia cyclic \u03b1-glucan (C\u03b1G) is composed of 12 glucoses linked in eleven \u03b2-(1\u21922) plus one \u03b1-(1\u21926) linkages [20]. M\u03b2CD consists of 7 O-methyl substituted glucoses in \u03b2-(1\u21924) linkages. Both B. melitensis and B. abortus C\u03b2G induced DC to express levels of CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC II molecules, comparable to those elicited by E. coli LPS (Figure 1A). The two Brucella C\u03b2G induced the secretion of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 (Figures 1B). The induction was dose-dependent (Figure S3A and S3B). These findings contrast with the poor DC-activating ability of Brucella LPS [2]. When compared to Brucella abortus C\u03b2G, the synthetic M\u03b2CD did not stimulate DC (**p<0.01) and the Ralstonia C\u03b1G hardly induced (**p<0.01) the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 (Figure 1B).

These DC were activated with either C\u03b2G or different TLR agonists such as CpG (TLR9 agonist), Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6 agonist), curdlan (linear \u03b2-1,3 glucan from Alcaligenes faecalis agonist of Dectin-1 [22], [23]) and E. coli LPS (TLR4/MD2/CD14 agonist). Neither E. coli LPS nor B. melitensis C\u03b2G were able to induce the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (Figure 2A) and secretion of IL-12 (Figures 2B, 2C) by BMDC from TLR4\u2212/\u2212, Myd88\u2212/\u2212, Myd88/TRIF\u2212/\u2212 and TRIF\u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, transfection of HEK 293T cells with vectors coding for TLR4/MD2, TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 showed that C\u03b2G effect is dependent on TLR4/MD2 (not shown). Moreover, C\u03b2G-treated human blood plasmacytoid DC (pDC) known to be devoid of surface TLR4 expression [24]\u2013[26] were not activated by any of these agents (data not shown). These results show that DC activation by C\u03b2G is TLR4-dependent and that DC activation is dependent on both MyD88 and TRIF adaptors (Figure 2B, left panel).",

First, several monoclonal antibodies specific for Dectin-1 that can inhibit curdlan-mediated activation failed to inhibit C\u03b2G-mediated DC activation (not shown). While double MyD88/TRIF\u2212/\u2212 BMDC did not respond to C\u03b2G (**p<0.01), they secreted high levels of IL-12 in response to curdlan (Figure 2C).

CD14\u2212/\u2212 DC also failed to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and MHC-II in response to LPS (not shown). Strikingly, C\u03b2G was able to stimulate CD14\u2212/\u2212 DC to secrete IL-12 (Figure 2D).",

At day 3 post-immunization, OVA-specific OT-I T cell proliferation of all immunized mice was detected in the draining lymph nodes (Figure 3). OVA-specific T cells from mice immunized with Poly I:C, MPLA and C\u03b2G showed an up-regulation of CD25 and a down-regulation of CD62L, which correlated with T cell migration from lymph nodes to the sites of infection. OVA-specific T cells from mice treated with C\u03b2G showed a stronger down-regulation of CD62L expression than those treated with Poly I:C or MPLA (Figure 3).",

Statistical comparison (Ttest, p-value 0.01, no correction) between C\u03b2G-treated and LPS-treated mDC yielded 133 differentially regulated transcripts (data not shown), highlighting the similarities and the differences between the two stimuli. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified DC maturation as the most significantly represented canonical pathway among genes over-expressed in C\u03b2G-treated mDC (Figure 4B), and PDFG signalling as the most represented pathway among genes under-expressed in C\u03b2G-treated mDC (Figure 4C).

Low IFN-\u03b3 levels were observed in PBMC cultured with DC and control IgG4 with or without the adjuvants (Figure 8A). Moreover DC targeting by anti-CD40 and anti-DCIR enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells. Potent memory CD4+ T (Figure 8A), but not CD8+ T cell (not shown) responses were observed after DC-PBMC co-culture in these conditions.",
                        "Few CD4+ T cell responses could be induced when anti-CD40 targeted-DC were treated with Poly I:C, as demonstrated by the presence of some CD3+CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T cell (1.21% of parents cells, Figure 8A). However, C\u03b2G-treated DC using anti-CD40 targeting induced a dramatic increase of CD3+CD4+INF-\u03b3+ cells (3.53% of parent cells compared to 0.85% without stimulation, Figure 8A). When anti-DCIR vaccine targeting was used, we could not observe any difference in CD4+INF-\u03b3+ T cell population with or without stimulation (Figure 8A).",
                        "We next studied C\u03b2G effect in DC targeting experiments with PBMC from acute TB patients. For this, we used humanized anti-CD40 or anti-DCIR antibodies coupled to Ag85BD41-ESAT6-Rv1980D24 Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens developed by the ANRS (French agency of research against AIDS and viral hepatitis). DC targeting with control IgG4 and the specific peptides in the presence of adjuvants triggered IFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+ T cells (Figure 8B). This induction was increased in the presence of C\u03b2G upon anti-CD40 and anti-DCIR targeting. The stimulation by Poly I:C slightly enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production only upon anti-DCIR targeting (Figure 8B).",
                        "Taken together, these data show that Brucella C\u03b2G increases CD4+ T memory responses after DC targeting of PBMC in HCV cured and acute TB patients."

                "Vaccination represents the most effective strategy to combat infectious diseases. Vaccines are composed of antigens and adjuvants, which activate antigen-presenting cells which then triggers the activation, differentiation and expansion of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes [15], [31]\u2013[33]. The number of approved adjuvants effective in humans is very limited since they are mostly based on alum and on emulsions. Ideally, adjuvants should elicit a selected immune response (i.e. cellular or humoral immunity depending on the requirements for protection), be safe (sufficiently immunogenic, without excessive inflammation) and cost-effective [16], [18], [31]. The benefits of adjuvant incorporation into any vaccine formulation should significantly outweigh the risks of adverse reactions. Unfortunately, potent adjuvant action is often correlated with increased toxicity, as exemplified by Freund's complete adjuvant or LPS. Thus, one of the major challenges in human adjuvant development is to identify compounds that enhance vaccine antigen induced responses with maximum tolerability and safety [31]. In particular, there is a high demand for adjuvants that stimulate cellular immunity [15], [16], [18]. Here, we demonstrate that Brucella C\u03b2G is a non-immunogenic and non-toxic molecule capable of triggering the activation of cellular responses in vivo. Moreover, Brucella C\u03b2G dramatically increases specific memory CD4+ T cell responses of human PBMC induced by DC-targeting fusion proteins expressing either HCV antigens or Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Based on these data, we propose that Brucella C\u03b2G is a candidate adjuvant that might be used in humans.",
                "There has been an interest to identify TLR4 agonists with a dampened toxicity. A recent example of lipid A analog is MPLA known to activate immune cells with similar properties of the LPS but less toxic and non immunogenic [34], [35]. Our results show that C\u03b2G-induced DC maturation is dependent on TLR4 as well as Myd88 and TRIF adaptor molecules. While C\u03b2G activates all human mDC subsets, it does not activate pDC, which is consistent with their lack of TLR4 [24]\u2013[26]. However, what differentiates C\u03b2G from MPLA and Ploy I:C is that C\u03b2G induces an early immune response (Figure 3). This might have a significant impact on the quality of the immune response to vaccines [36].",
                "We previously showed that Brucella C\u03b2G is capable of interacting with lipid rafts and modulate their organization [6]. Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin that are involved in intracellular signalling and membrane transport. In particular, lipid rafts are involved in the regulation and activation of several important immune receptor complexes such as the TLR4 complex [37]. [38]. It is thus possible that Brucella C\u03b2G triggers TLR4-dependent signalling through its effect on cholesterol in lipid rafts as it has been suggested for alum [15]. Indeed, alum recognition may occur indirectly through the release of endogenous uric acid. Recently, it was shown that monosodium urate crystals activate DC by interacting with the cell membrane, which leads to plasma membrane lipid sorting probably via interaction with cholesterol [15].",
                "Herein, we observed that in contrast to E. coli LPS [27], Brucella C\u03b2G-induced BMDC maturation was independent of the GPI-anchored protein CD14. Actually, the synthetic lipid A compound CRX-527 does not require CD14 to engage MyD88-dependent and TRIF/IRF3-dependent pathways downstream TLR4 [39]. Furthermore, the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) triggers innate responses during urinary tract infection in a TLR4-dependent and CD14-independent manner both in mice and humans [40]. These results clearly indicate that CD14 is not required for TLR4-dependent cell activation. The detailed signalling pathway involved in C\u03b2G-dependent cell activation will require further studies including the discovery of putative co-receptors associated to TLR4. Until now, we know that neither dectin-1 nor TLR2 contribute to the activation. Additional studies are planned to determine whether the CD14-independent C\u03b2G-dependent DC activation will have any therapeutic value.",
                "C\u03b2G displays interesting properties such as water solubility, limited toxicity and lack of immunogenicity together with a potent DC activation capacity that can trigger CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Therefore, C\u03b2G might constitute a new class of adjuvants for future vaccines."

For C\u03b2G extraction and purification, the protocol described before [6] was used. Briefly, a C\u03b2G-rich crude fraction was first obtained by ethanol precipitation of a hot water extract of killed bacteria, and freed from nucleic acids or proteins by digestion with DNase and RNase proteinase K. To remove LPS, the fluid was extracted with a volume of phenol (in contrast to most LPS, Brucella LPS and lipid A partition into the phenol phase [42] at 70\u00b0C for 30 min, the mixture chilled and centrifuged (8000\u00d7 g, 0\u00b0C, 15 min), and the aqueous phase collected and re-extracted again with phenol under the same conditions. The new aqueous phase was dialyzed, clarified by brief centrifugation and freeze-dried. The identity of C\u03b2G was demonstrated by 13C-NMR spectroscopy and high-performance TLC, and the absence of Brucella LPS or other contaminants was demonstrated by UV-spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE, gel immunoprecipitation, and 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid analyses [42]. To further demonstrate the absence of lipid A, purified C\u03b2G were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described before [45]. Briefly, 5 mg of lyophilized Brucella's C\u03b2G were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of chloroform-methanol-water (3\u22361.5\u22360.25 [vol/vol/vol]) and 1 \u00b5l aliquot of was deposited on the target and covered with the same amount of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (Sigma) dissolved in chloroform-methanol-water (3\u22361.5\u22360.25 [vol/vol/vol]).

C56BL/6 mice were immunized in the right ear with either: 20 \u00b5g of Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL) in 10 \u00b5l of PBS, 200 \u00b5g of C\u03b2G in 10 \u00b5l of PBS, 10 \u00b5g of LPS in 10 \u00b5l of PBS, 50 \u00b5g of Poly I/C in 10 \u00b5l of PBS. PBS was injected in the left ear as negative control. The animals were sacrificed 48 h later and both the adjuvant-treated and untreated ears were collected for further determination. Ears were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, embedded in paraffin, then sectioned at 4 \u00b5m at two levels separated by 1 mm interval and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Normal skin histology was evaluated in PBS-inoculated contralateral ear for each mouse."
