The vaccine comprises a conjugate of one or more high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors with several M. tuberculosis protein antigens. The vaccine composition described herein delivers antigen specifically to DCs for the purpose of vaccination to evoke potent humoral and cellular immune responses. The vaccine composition of the present invention promotes efficient recall memory induced in blood from TB patients.",
                        "TB is a leading cause of death: in 2006, there were 9.2 million new cases of active TB and an estimated 1.5 million deaths in the world, according to the World Health Organization. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population harbors Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in the form of non-replicating bacilli (latent tuberculosis) (1). In addition, an increasing proportion of TB cases results from infection with M. tuberculosis resistant to first line chemotherapy (multi-drug resistant TB or MDR-TB) (2). M. bovis BCG, the only vaccine against TB currently available, prevents 80% of childhood military disease and meningitis, but its efficacy in preventing pulmonary disease in adulthood is rather low (3). Therefore, efficient therapeutic vaccines are urgently needed to cure active and latent TB patients. Furthermore, according to the World Health Organization, M. tuberculosis is also the major opportunistic pathogen associated with HIV disease, contributing significantly to HIV-associated mortality (almost 25% of HIV-related deaths are from TB).",
                        "Dendritic cells (DCs) are leukocytes specialized in the uptake, processing and presentation of antigens and play fundamental roles in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity functions and in maintaining immunological tolerance. They are mainly localized at the interface between body surfaces and the environment, continuously scrutinizing incoming antigen for the potential threat it may represent for the body. To control immune responses against a large variety of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria they exhibit at their surface a large number of receptors, which have been shown to be crucial in DC biological functions in vivo by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These specialized pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) whose engagement modulates the functional activity of DCs, include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (4). Following pathogen contact, PRRs are endocytosed by immature DCs, which induce the DC to enter a developmental program called maturation, which transforms DCs from sentinels into efficient APCs and T cell stimulators (5). With the induction of maturation, DCs undergo massive morphological and functional changes. Antigen internalization is down modulated due to repression of most antigen-receptors and to an overall reduction in phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. In addition, MHC molecules are redistributed from intracellular endocytic compartments to the cell surface (6,7). Peptide loading as well as the half-life of MHC molecules is increased (6,7). Finally, the surface expression of T cell costimulatory molecules also rises. Concomitant with the modifications of their antigen presentation abilities, maturation induces migration of DCs out of peripheral tissues (8). Modifications in the expression of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as profound changes of the cytoskeleton organization, contribute to the migration of DCs, through the lymph, towards secondary lymphoid organs (9). By linking antigen uptake, peptide loading, and cell migration to the encounter of a pathogen, DCs restrict antigen presentation to those antigens internalized during maturation, thus favoring the stimulation of T cells specific for potentially pathogenic antigens.",
                        "All these biological events result in the activation of specific signaling pathways that lead to the induction of specific immune responses against these pathogens, in part through expression of effector cytokines. The resulting T cell responses following these interactions between PRRs and PAMPs have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the way the PPRs are internalized and how from inside the cell, they are able to dictate and orientate immune responses. The present inventors have previously produced high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors, and prepared fusion proteins with antigens for DC-targeting vaccine generation. Targeting antigens to DCs using these fusion proteins recognizing different CLRs resulted in different biological responses. The inventors hypothesize is that subsets of human DCs express distinct receptors that need to be mobilized in order to mount a durable immune response adapted to each microbial invasion, depending on the pathogen to be eliminated. To test this hypothesis, the inventors have prepared high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors to which antibodies have been conjugated to several M. tuberculosis protein antigens to develop novel human vaccines based on in vivo DC-targeting.",
                        "Construction of TB vaccine, Antigen selection: M. tuberculosis genome encodes for more than 4000 genes. Antigens selected were tested with PBMCs from active or latent TB patients. IFN\u03b3 secretion was measured to identify antigens recognized (FIG. 1). The data showed that several antigens are broadly recognized and therefore constitute potential antigens that will be fused to recombinant mAb. These include: ESAT6, CFP10, Rv1980 and combination of antigens: CFP10-f2-ESAT6 and Rv0287-f2-Rv0288. One antigen, Rv0475, is recognized mainly by latent TB patient as already reported in the literature (10-12). Because ESAT6 and CFP10 are used as a diagnostic tool to identify TB patients from environmental mycobacteria-infected person, clinical trials have focused on using Rv0288 instead of ESAT6. The inventors also chose Ag85B as a potential antigen even though its immunogenicity was not detected in the study described above. The inventors chose 5 antigens: ESAT6, Rv0288, Rv0475, Rv1980 and Ag85B. The sequences of the selected antigens are presented herein below. The underlined amino acids within parentheses are sequences that have been removed from the protein for better expression.",
                        "Vaccine description: Vaccines are recombinant monoclonal antibodies recognizing specific receptors expressed at the surface of DCs. These recombinant mAb are then conjugated to selected antigens (fusion to the C terminus of the heavy chain or the light chain). The inventors selected four recombinant antibodies: \u03b1CD40, \u03b1DCIR, \u03b1Lox-1 and \u03b1Langerin. These antibodies have been conjugated to the selected antigens Ag85B\u039441, ESAT6, Rv0288 and Rv1980\u039424 from M. tuberculosis (FIG. 2). To cover as many potential epitopes from different antigens as possible, the inventors fused three selected antigens to the heavy chain of different recombinant mAbs, resulting in 2 constructs (FIG. 2). One antigen, Rv0475, was also fused to the light chain of each antibody (FIG. 3). The vaccine harbors three antigens fused to the heavy chain (Ag85B, Rv1980 and ESAT6 or Rv0288) and one to the light chain (Rv0475) as depicted in FIG. 4.",
                        "Vaccine evaluation: Vaccine candidates were tested in targeting studies by incubating vaccines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TB patients (latent or active) or by loading monocyte-derived DCs with the recombinant mAb follow by addition of T-lymphocytes. After 11 days of culture, the efficiency of each vaccine in eliciting an immune recall response was assessed by cytokines secretion (in the culture supernatant or following intracellular staining) as seen in FIGS. 5A-5F and Table 1.",
                        "FIGS. 5A-5F demonstrate the ability of recombinant anti-DCIR and anti-CD40 antibodies fused to individual TB antigen to elicit expansion of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from TB patients: Delivering ESAT6 to DCs through CD40 and DCIR induces IFN\u03b3-TNF\u03b1-producing ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells. Monocytes-derived DCs (GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3) were loaded ON with 10 (FIGS. 5A-5C) or 100 pM (FIGS. 5D-5F) of each targeting antibody. T cells were then added (1:40 ratio) and cultivated for 8 days with addition of 100 U of IL-2 at day 2 and day 5. At day 9, DCs were thawed and loaded ON with 1 nM of targeting mAbs (IgG4, \u03b1CD40 and \u03b1DCIR). On day 9.5 50,000 loaded-DCs (IgG4, \u03b1CD40 and \u03b1DCIR) or unloaded were then added. After 6 h, frequency of peptide-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with intracellular IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ was assessed by FACS analysis. Thus, the data shows that \u03b1CD40 and \u03b1DCIR vaccines bearing a TB antigen can recall a potent memory antigen-specific anti-CD4+ T cell response in vitro. In this in vitro culture system \u03b1CD40 and \u03b1DCIR are equally potent vaccines (DCs used in this assay express both receptors).",
