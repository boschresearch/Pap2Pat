## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.

To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as “a”, “an,” and “the” are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.

As used herein, the term “Antigen Presenting Cells” (APC) refers to cells that are capable of activating T cells, and include, but are not limited to, certain macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells. “Dendritic cells” (DCs) refers to any member of a diverse population of morphologically similar cell types found in lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissues. These cells are characterized by their distinctive morphology, high levels of surface MHC-class II expression (Steinman, et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 9:271 (1991); incorporated herein by reference for its description of such cells). These cells can be isolated from a number of tissue sources, and conveniently, from peripheral blood, as described herein. Dendritic cell binding proteins refers to any protein for which receptors are expressed on a dendritic cell. Examples include GM-CSF, IL-1, TNF, IL-4, CD40L, CTLA4, CD28, and FLT-3 ligand.

For the purpose of the present invention, the term “vaccine composition” is intended to mean a composition which can be administered to humans or to animals in order to induce an immune system response; this immune system response can result in a production of antibodies or simply in the activation of certain cells, in particular antigen-presenting cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. The vaccine composition can be a composition for prophylactic purposes or for therapeutic purposes, or both. As used herein, the term “antigen” refers to any antigen which can be used in a vaccine, whether it involves a whole microorganism or a subunit, and whatever its nature: peptide, protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide, glycolipid, lipopeptide, etc. They may be viral antigens, bacterial antigens, or the like; the term “antigen” also comprises the polynucleotides, the sequences of which are chosen so as to encode the antigens whose expression by the individuals to which the polynucleotides are administered is desired, in the case of the immunization technique referred to as DNA immunization. They may also be a set of antigens, in particular in the case of a multivalent vaccine composition which comprises antigens capable of protecting against several diseases, and which is then generally referred to as a vaccine combination, or in the case of a composition which comprises several different antigens in order to protect against a single disease, as is the case for certain vaccines against whooping cough or the flu, for example. The term “antibodies” refers to immunoglobulins, whether natural or partially or wholly produced artificially, e.g. recombinant. An antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. The antibody may, in some cases, be a member of one, or a combination immunoglobulin classes, including: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE.

The term “adjuvant” refers to a substance that enhances, augments or potentiates the host's immune response to a vaccine antigen.

The term “gene” is used to refer to a functional protein, polypeptide or peptide-encoding unit. As will be understood by those in the art, this functional term includes both genomic sequences, cDNA sequences, or fragments or combinations thereof, as well as gene products, including those that may have been altered by the hand of man. Purified genes, nucleic acids, protein and the like are used to refer to these entities when identified and separated from at least one contaminating nucleic acid or protein with which it is ordinarily associated.

As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuclease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers that are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA), or analogs of naturally-occurring nucleotides (e.g., α-enantiomeric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in pyrimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, such as aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoranilidate, phosphoramidate, and the like. The term “nucleic acid molecule” also includes so-called “peptide nucleic acids,” which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either single stranded or double stranded.

As used in this application, the term “amino acid” means one of the naturally occurring amino carboxylic acids of which proteins are comprised. The term “polypeptide” as described herein refers to a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds, whether produced naturally or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about 10 amino acid residues are commonly referred to as “peptides.” A “protein” is a macromolecule comprising one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may also comprise non-peptidic components, such as carbohydrate groups. Carbohydrates and other non-peptidic substituents may be added to a protein by the cell in which the protein is produced, and will vary with the type of cell. Proteins are defined herein in terms of their amino acid backbone structures; substituents such as carbohydrate groups are generally not specified, but may be present nonetheless.

As used herein, the term “in vivo” refers to being inside the body. The term “in vitro” used as used in the present application is to be understood as indicating an operation carried out in a non-living system.

As used herein, the term “treatment” or “treating” means any administration of a compound of the present invention and includes (1) inhibiting the disease in an animal that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the diseased (i.e., arresting further development of the pathology and/or symptomatology), or (2) ameliorating the disease in an animal that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the diseased (i.e., reversing the pathology and/or symptomatology).

The present invention describes a novel tuberculosis (TB) human vaccine based on in vivo dendritic cell (DC)-targeting. The vaccine comprises a conjugate of one or more high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors with several M. tuberculosis protein antigens. The vaccine composition described herein delivers antigen specifically to DCs for the purpose of vaccination to evoke potent humoral and cellular immune responses. The vaccine composition of the present invention promotes efficient recall memory induced in blood from TB patients.

TB is a leading cause of death: in 2006, there were 9.2 million new cases of active TB and an estimated 1.5 million deaths in the world, according to the World Health Organization. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population harbors Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in the form of non-replicating bacilli (latent tuberculosis) (1). In addition, an increasing proportion of TB cases results from infection with M. tuberculosis resistant to first line chemotherapy (multi-drug resistant TB or MDR-TB) (2). M. bovis BCG, the only vaccine against TB currently available, prevents 80% of childhood military disease and meningitis, but its efficacy in preventing pulmonary disease in adulthood is rather low (3). Therefore, efficient therapeutic vaccines are urgently needed to cure active and latent TB patients. Furthermore, according to the World Health Organization, M. tuberculosis is also the major opportunistic pathogen associated with HIV disease, contributing significantly to HIV-associated mortality (almost 25% of HIV-related deaths are from TB).

Dendritic cells (DCs) are leukocytes specialized in the uptake, processing and presentation of antigens and play fundamental roles in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity functions and in maintaining immunological tolerance. They are mainly localized at the interface between body surfaces and the environment, continuously scrutinizing incoming antigen for the potential threat it may represent for the body. To control immune responses against a large variety of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria they exhibit at their surface a large number of receptors, which have been shown to be crucial in DC biological functions in vivo by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These specialized pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) whose engagement modulates the functional activity of DCs, include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (4). Following pathogen contact, PRRs are endocytosed by immature DCs, which induce the DC to enter a developmental program called maturation, which transforms DCs from sentinels into efficient APCs and T cell stimulators (5). With the induction of maturation, DCs undergo massive morphological and functional changes. Antigen internalization is down modulated due to repression of most antigen-receptors and to an overall reduction in phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. In addition, MHC molecules are redistributed from intracellular endocytic compartments to the cell surface (6,7). Peptide loading as well as the half-life of MHC molecules is increased (6,7). Finally, the surface expression of T cell costimulatory molecules also rises. Concomitant with the modifications of their antigen presentation abilities, maturation induces migration of DCs out of peripheral tissues (8). Modifications in the expression of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as profound changes of the cytoskeleton organization, contribute to the migration of DCs, through the lymph, towards secondary lymphoid organs (9). By linking antigen uptake, peptide loading, and cell migration to the encounter of a pathogen, DCs restrict antigen presentation to those antigens internalized during maturation, thus favoring the stimulation of T cells specific for potentially pathogenic antigens.

All these biological events result in the activation of specific signaling pathways that lead to the induction of specific immune responses against these pathogens, in part through expression of effector cytokines. The resulting T cell responses following these interactions between PRRs and PAMPs have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the way the PPRs are internalized and how from inside the cell, they are able to dictate and orientate immune responses. The present inventors have previously produced high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors, and prepared fusion proteins with antigens for DC-targeting vaccine generation. Targeting antigens to DCs using these fusion proteins recognizing different CLRs resulted in different biological responses. The inventors hypothesize is that subsets of human DCs express distinct receptors that need to be mobilized in order to mount a durable immune response adapted to each microbial invasion, depending on the pathogen to be eliminated. To test this hypothesis, the inventors have prepared high affinity monoclonal antibodies against several DC receptors to which antibodies have been conjugated to several M. tuberculosis protein antigens to develop novel human vaccines based on in vivo DC-targeting.

Construction of TB vaccine, Antigen selection: M. tuberculosis genome encodes for more than 4000 genes. Antigens selected were tested with PBMCs from active or latent TB patients. IFNγ secretion was measured to identify antigens recognized (FIG. 1). The data showed that several antigens are broadly recognized and therefore constitute potential antigens that will be fused to recombinant mAb. These include: ESAT6, CFP10, Rv1980 and combination of antigens: CFP10-f2-ESAT6 and Rv0287-f2-Rv0288. One antigen, Rv0475, is recognized mainly by latent TB patient as already reported in the literature (10-12). Because ESAT6 and CFP10 are used as a diagnostic tool to identify TB patients from environmental mycobacteria-infected person, clinical trials have focused on using Rv0288 instead of ESAT6. The inventors also chose Ag85B as a potential antigen even though its immunogenicity was not detected in the study described above. The inventors chose 5 antigens: ESAT6, Rv0288, Rv0475, Rv1980 and Ag85B. The sequences of the selected antigens are presented herein below. The underlined amino acids within parentheses are sequences that have been removed from the protein for better expression.

Vaccine description: Vaccines are recombinant monoclonal antibodies recognizing specific receptors expressed at the surface of DCs. These recombinant mAb are then conjugated to selected antigens (fusion to the C terminus of the heavy chain or the light chain). The inventors selected four recombinant antibodies: αCD40, αDCIR, αLox-1 and αLangerin. These antibodies have been conjugated to the selected antigens Ag85BΔ41, ESAT6, Rv0288 and Rv1980Δ24 from M. tuberculosis (FIG. 2). To cover as many potential epitopes from different antigens as possible, the inventors fused three selected antigens to the heavy chain of different recombinant mAbs, resulting in 2 constructs (FIG. 2). One antigen, Rv0475, was also fused to the light chain of each antibody (FIG. 3). The vaccine harbors three antigens fused to the heavy chain (Ag85B, Rv1980 and ESAT6 or Rv0288) and one to the light chain (Rv0475) as depicted in FIG. 4.

Vaccine evaluation: Vaccine candidates were tested in targeting studies by incubating vaccines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TB patients (latent or active) or by loading monocyte-derived DCs with the recombinant mAb follow by addition of T-lymphocytes. After 11 days of culture, the efficiency of each vaccine in eliciting an immune recall response was assessed by cytokines secretion (in the culture supernatant or following intracellular staining) as seen in FIGS. 5A-5F and Table 1.

FIGS. 5A-5F demonstrate the ability of recombinant anti-DCIR and anti-CD40 antibodies fused to individual TB antigen to elicit expansion of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from TB patients: Delivering ESAT6 to DCs through CD40 and DCIR induces IFNγ-TNFα-producing ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells. Monocytes-derived DCs (GM-CSF and IFNγ) were loaded ON with 10 (FIGS. 5A-5C) or 100 pM (FIGS. 5D-5F) of each targeting antibody. T cells were then added (1:40 ratio) and cultivated for 8 days with addition of 100 U of IL-2 at day 2 and day 5. At day 9, DCs were thawed and loaded ON with 1 nM of targeting mAbs (IgG4, αCD40 and αDCIR). On day 9.5 50,000 loaded-DCs (IgG4, αCD40 and αDCIR) or unloaded were then added. After 6 h, frequency of peptide-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with intracellular IFNγ+TNFα+ was assessed by FACS analysis. Thus, the data shows that αCD40 and αDCIR vaccines bearing a TB antigen can recall a potent memory antigen-specific anti-CD4+ T cell response in vitro. In this in vitro culture system αCD40 and αDCIR are equally potent vaccines (DCs used in this assay express both receptors).

ESAT6 and CFP-10 were fused to IgG4, αCD40 and αDCIR and incubated with PBMCs from TB patients at different concentration (from 10 nM to 1 pM). Cells were cultivated for 8 days with addition of 100 U of IL-2 at day 2 and day 5. At day 8, cells were washed in DPBS and rested for 36 h. At day 9.5, cluster of peptides (10 μM each peptide) were used to stimulate cells for another 36 h. Supernatants were recovered and IFNγ secretion measured. IFNγ secretion is indicated in pg/ml.

The data presented hereinabove shows that both αCD40 and αDCIR vaccines bearing TB antigens can recall a potent memory antigen-specific T cell response in vitro resulting in IFNγ secretion. Specific immune responses were observed with low doses of vaccines, i.e., between 1 and 100 pM. Both constructs induced similar levels of IFNγ secretion in different patients.
