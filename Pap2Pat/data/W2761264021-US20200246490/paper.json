    "abstract": "Hepatic mitochondria play a central role in the regulation of intermediary metabolism and maintenance of normoglycemia, and there is great interest in assessing rates of hepatic mitochondrial citrate synthase flux (V CS) and pyruvate carboxylase flux (V PC) in vivo. Here, we show that a positional isotopomer NMR tracer analysis (PINTA) method can be used to non-invasively assess rates of V CS and V PC fluxes using a combined NMR/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma following infusion of [3-13C]lactate and glucose tracer. PINTA measures V CS and V PC fluxes over a wide range of physiological conditions with minimal pyruvate cycling and detects increased hepatic V CS following treatment with a liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupler. Finally, validation studies in humans demonstrate that the V PC/V CS ratio measured by PINTA is similar to that determined by in vivo NMR spectroscopy. This method will provide investigators with a relatively simple tool to non-invasively examine the role of altered hepatic mitochondrial metabolism.Liver mitochondrial metabolism plays an important role for glucose and lipid homeostasis and its alterations contribute to metabolic disorders, including fatty liver and diabetes. Here Perry et al. develop a method for the measurement of hepatic fluxes by using lactate and glucose tracers in combination with NMR spectroscopy.",

                "Hepatic mitochondrial function plays a critical role in the regulation of liver and whole-body glucose and fat metabolism and there is great interest in understanding the potential role for alterations in hepatic mitochondrial activity in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well for the evaluation of potential novel therapies targeting hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation to treat these diseases. Although recent studies by our group have demonstrated the utility of in vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to directly assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation flux (VCS) and pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) in humans1, 2, application of this method is expensive, time- and labor-intensive, and requires an in vivo wide-bore (>0.8\u2009m), high-field (\u22654\u2009Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging system modified to do 13C MRS, which is available at only a few academic medical centers worldwide. To date the only non-invasive tracer method that has been described to assess hepatic mitochondrial fluxes in vivo utilizes [13C3]propionate3\u20136. A disadvantage of the propionate method is that it can alter hepatic mitochondrial metabolism in part through generation of high concentrations of propionyl-CoA7, 8. A key motivation for this study is to develop an alternative non-invasive tracer method to model hepatic metabolism in vivo with minimal perturbation of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism.",
                "To address this unmet need, we have developed a simple positional isotopomer Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tracer analysis (PINTA) method by which hepatic glucose production, anaplerosis and citrate synthase flux can be non-invasively assessed based on NMR and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of plasma following an infusion of [3-13C]lactate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a, b). To validate this method, we performed independent cross-validation studies and observed an excellent correlation (P\u2009<\u200910\u221215, R2\u2009=\u20090.99) between VPC/VCS calculated using PINTA and our previous ex vivo NMR tracer technique in rats9, 10, and similar VPC/VCS ratios measured in healthy human subjects using two independent tracer methods (infusion of [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]acetate1, 2). Validation studies demonstrate the ability of the PINTA method to measure an increase in VCS flux following treatment with a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP), which promoted liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling11 and an increase in the VPC/VEGP ratio after an extended fast. Taken together these data demonstrate that the PINTA method is sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate meaningful differences in hepatic mitochondrial flux rates in various physiological and pathophysiological states in both humans and rodent models of diabetes, NAFLD/NASH and other metabolic diseases. Furthermore, this method will be very useful for assessing target engagement for novel therapies that are currently being developed to promote increased hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH and T2D."

                "Alterations in hepatic fatty acid metabolism play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance and increased rates of gluconeogenesis in patients with T2D13\u201315 and alterations in hepatic mitochondrial metabolism have been proposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD6, 16, 17 and NASH18. Furthermore liver-targeted agents to promote increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation through inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase19, 20 and liver-targeted11, 21, 22 and untargeted23 mitochondrial uncoupling agents are currently being developed to treat NAFLD/NASH and T2D. Thus there is great interest in developing non-invasive methods to assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis in vivo. Here we show that by simply assessing the positional isotopomer enrichments of the C4 and C5 carbons of plasma glucose by a combined 13C NMR/GC-MS method following an infusion of [3-13C]lactate we can non-invasively assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidative (VCS) and gluconeogenic fluxes from pyruvate (VPC) in awake rodents and humans. Furthermore, by combining these VPC/VCS relative flux measurements with assessment of endogenous glucose production and assessment of the ratio of VPC/VEGP enrichment calculated from the m\u2009+\u20091 and m\u2009+\u20092 enrichments of glucose, we can estimate absolute rates of VCS flux and VPC flux.",
                "To validate this method we first measured the ratio of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux to hepatic citrate synthase flux (VPC/VCS) using two methods following a steady-state infusion of [3-13C]lactate and [3-3H]glucose, comparing data obtained using our previously established ex vivo NMR analysis1, 7, 11 to the newly developed PINTA analysis (Supplementary Tables\u00a01 and 2) in seven groups of rats undergoing various physiological perturbations which could alter hepatic mitochondrial activity: (1) control chow-fed; (2) insulin-resistant high-fat-fed; (3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamped; (4) glucagon infused; (5) epinephrine-infused; (6) ME inhibitor7 treated; and (7) liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupler (CRMP11) treated rats. Using this approach, we observed a 1:1 correlation (Fig.\u00a01; R2\u2009=\u20090.99, slope\u2009=\u20090.98) for VPC/VCS using these two methods. Both methods rely on a similar small set of assumptions, including having reached steady state in the metabolites of interest and negligible enrichment in [1-13C]pyruvate, [1-13C]alanine, and [1-13C]acetyl-CoA. We have validated these assumptions in the current study by demonstrating stability of glucose enrichment in both rats and humans (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02b and 3a) and confirming minimal hepatic bicarbonate enrichment (1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%).",
                "Next, we used our PINTA and ex vivo NMR methods to calculate the ratio of VPC/VEGP. We observed a strong correlation (Fig.\u00a02; R2\u2009=\u20090.84, slope\u2009=\u20090.92) between ratios calculated using the two methods in all groups of rats. The calculation of this flux requires a different but related set of assumptions. PINTA measurement of VPC/VEGP assumes, in addition to achievement of steady state, a binomial probability analysis describing the distribution of 13C-glucose isotopomers resulting from the synthesis of two 13C-labeled trioses, and the presence of just one gluconeogenic precursor pool enrichment. The ex vivo NMR method, as we have described and validated10, assumes the presence of rapidly equilibrating small pools in the TCA cycle that are unperturbed by the tracer24, complete equilibration of C2 and C3 OAA25, and that the enrichment of malate reflects that of OAA. The strong correlation between two methods with differing assumptions is reassuring regarding the applicability of each method; however, future studies\u2014ideally comparing PINTA with [3-13C]lactate tracer to an alternative stable isotope tracer\u2014will be required to test the utility of PINTA in additional settings. Taken together these data demonstrate that the analysis of glucose by the PINTA method (Supplementary Tables\u00a01 and 2) closely approximates the VPC/VCS and VPC/VEGP ratios measured using an invasive method that requires rapidly snap freezing 3\u20134\u2009g of liver tissue in rodents within 10\u2009s of intravenously administered anesthesia.",
                "The primary goal of this report is to present a non-invasive method to measure hepatic oxidative and gluconeogenic fluxes that can be applied to humans. To examine the potential of PINTA to serve this purpose, we used two independent and complementary methods to calculate the ratio of VPC/VCS in humans infused with [1-13C]acetate and [3-13C]lactate in separate studies. We have previously reported extensive validation studies to support the use of this method for measuring hepatic fluxes in vivo1, 2 and now demonstrate that PINTA measures the ratio VPC/VCS similar to that determined using in vivo NMR analysis.",
                "Next, in order to confirm the sensitivity of PINTA measurements to expected changes in mitochondrial flux rates, we performed a validation study utilizing treatment with a liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling agent, CRMP, which we have previously established can selectively increase rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in vivo without inducing hyperthermia or any associated hepatic or systemic toxicities11, 21, 26, 27. As compared to vehicle-treated control rats, animals treated with CRMP exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in hepatic VCS flux consistent with its effects to increase hepatic tricarboxylic acid cycle activity through uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation activity. This 2.5-fold increase in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation induced by CRMP was associated with a ~70% reduction in the VPC/VCS ratio and ~10 and ~30% reductions in rates of endogenous glucose production and VPC flux, respectively (Table\u00a01). Finally, we examined VPC/VEGP flux in glycogen-replete rats fasted for 6\u2009h and compared this ratio to glycogen-depleted rats fasted for 48\u2009h. An extended fast increased VPC/VEGP flux six-fold, consistent with a shift in reliance upon increased mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase flux for glucose production in the absence of hepatic glycogen. These data demonstrate that the PINTA method is sufficiently sensitive to detect expected differences in both relative and absolute VPC/VCS fluxes as well as in the ratio VPC/VEGP with previously characterized physiological perturbations.",
                "The selection of isotope is always a critical factor in any tracer metabolic study and [3-13C]lactate has many advantages over other stable isotopes that have been used to assess hepatic mitochondrial and glucose metabolism. First, plasma lactate concentrations are 10\u2013100 fold greater than the plasma concentrations of glycerol, acetate or propionate and therefore significant 13C enrichment in hepatic lactate and its intraheptocellular metabolites can be achieved without significantly perturbing whole-body lactate metabolism. Furthermore, compared to glycerol, acetate and propionate, lactate has the lowest periportal perivenous gradient across the liver bed and therefore hepatocellular flux determinations using this isotope will be least impacted by any heterogeneity of mixing of tracer between periportal and perivenous hepatocytes28\u201330. In addition, [U-13C]propionate, when administered at doses commonly used to trace hepatic mitochondrial metabolism in human and animal studies, markedly increases plasma propionate concentrations, hepatic TCA cycle intermediates and hepatocellular propionyl CoA concentrations, a potent allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase leading to profound alterations in hepatic mitochondrial fluxes7. In contrast [3-13C]lactate can be infused at a rate that provides sufficient label to measure hepatic mitochondrial fluxes without significantly altering hepatocellular mitochondrial metabolites/fluxes7, 8. Because of its reliance on the assumption that pyruvate cycling is minimal the PINTA method would be of limited utility in settings where pyruvate kinase (PK) and/or ME flux is high relative to pyruvate carboxylase flux. To address this assumption, we have previously assessed rates of VPK+ME flux and found these rates to be very low compared to rates of VPC+PDH flux in healthy control subjects and insulin-resistant subjects with NAFLD following an overnight fast2. Consistent with these prior studies, we found in this study that VPK+ME flux relative to VPC+PDH flux is less than 6% in overnight fasted rodents (Supplementary Table\u00a01), which we find using a complete equation including these fluxes will have minimal impact on our estimates of VPC and VCS fluxes. This finding makes teleological sense in that rates of hepatic glycolysis (VPK) would be expected to be minimal relative to rates of VPC flux under fasting conditions in order to provide maximal net flux through gluconeogenesis to support obligate glucose-utilizing organs like the brain and renal medulla while minimizing energy dissipation due to futile cycling. However, under other conditions such as hyperthyroidism, which significantly increases rates of hepatic pyruvate cycling due to increased VME flux31, 32, as well as under hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions, when rates of hepatic glycolysis would be expected to be significantly increased, it will be necessary to adjust these PINTA determined rates of VPC/VCS flux using the equation provided in the Methods.",
                "The use of the PINTA method to measure VPC flux also has advantages over the 2H2O method33\u201336 to measure gluconeogenic flux rates. In addition to the improved specificity afforded by measuring VPC instead of total gluconeogenesis, infusion of [3-13C]lactate is practically simpler for both investigator and subject: the 2H2O method requires dosing of 2H2O several hours prior to assessment of gluconeogenesis in order to allow adequate time for 2H2O equilibration in the whole-body water space. Furthermore, 2H2O administration is often associated with dizziness, nystagmus, nausea and occasional vomiting, which can be a limiting factor in the clinical setting.",
                "In summary, here we describe a non-invasive (PINTA) method to measure rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux in vivo during an infusion of [3-13C]lactate in combination with a glucose tracer to assess rates of endogenous glucose production. It is anticipated that this method will provide investigators with a relatively simple and widely available means of examining the role of altered hepatic mitochondrial and glucose metabolism in various physiologic and pathophysiologic states in humans and rodent models of diabetes as well as to examine target engagement for novel therapies that are currently being developed to promote increased rates of hepatic fatty acid oxidation for the treatment of NASH and T2D."

As discussed previously the calculated anaplerotic flux can also include ME flux but under the conditions studied we have shown that ME flux is negligible compared to anaplerotic flux2, 7.

In this calculation, we assume that the flux from PC will continue through PEPCK and subsequent gluconeogenic reactions, and end up in liver glucose. We note that this will be a maximum estimate of the PC contribution due to the possibility of futile cycling where PEP is converted by PK into pyruvate. Our previous in vivo animal and human studies suggest that VPK+ME flux is relatively low compared to VPC flux under fasting conditions2, 7. Consistent with these prior studies we find that VPK+ME flux/VPC+PDH flux is relatively low (<15%) under several physiologic conditions (Supplementary Table\u00a01) and that these low rates of pyruvate cycling will have a minimal impact of our estimated VPC/VCS ratio.",

The total m\u2009+\u20091 and m\u2009+\u20092 [13C] glucose enrichment was measured using a pentaacetate derivative: plasma or liver samples were deproteinized using five volumes of methanol, dried and derivatized with 75\u2009\u03bcl of 1:1 acetic anhydride:pyridine. After heating to 65\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min, the reaction was terminated by adding 25\u2009\u03bcl methanol, and m\u2009+\u20091 and m\u2009+\u20092 (as well as m\u2009+\u20093\u2026m\u2009+\u20096) were determined by GC/MS (CI mode, m/z 331 [m], 332 [m\u2009+\u20091], 333 [m\u2009+\u20092],\u2026337 [m\u2009+\u20096]).
