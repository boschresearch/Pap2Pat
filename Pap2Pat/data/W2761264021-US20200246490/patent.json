    "title": "Non-Invasive Assessment of Hepatic Mitochondrial Metabolism by Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA)",
    "date": "2018-10-05 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present provides a Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) method that can be used to noninvasively assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) and/or pyruvate carboxylase (VPC) flux in a subject. In certain embodiments, the methods utilize a combined NMR/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma following infusion of [3-13C]lactate and glucose tracer. The method of the invention provides investigators with a tool to non-invasively examine the role of altered hepatic mitochondrial metabolism and study the effects of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and type 2 diabetes (T2D).",

                        "Hepatic mitochondrial function plays a critical role in the regulation of liver and whole-body glucose and fat metabolism. There is great interest in understanding the potential role for alterations in hepatic mitochondrial activity in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well for the evaluation of potential novel therapies targeting hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation to treat these diseases.",
                        "While recent studies have demonstrated the utility of in vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to directly assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation flux (VCS) and pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) in humans, application of this method is expensive, time- and labor-intensive, and requires an in vivo wide-bore (>0.8m), high field (\u22654-Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system modified to do 13C MRS, which is available at only a few academic medical centers worldwide. To date the only non-invasive tracer method described to assess hepatic mitochondrial fluxes in vivo utilizes [13C3]propionate. A disadvantage of the propionate method is that it can alter hepatic mitochondrial metabolism in part through generation of high concentrations of propionyl-CoA. An alternative non-invasive tracer method to model hepatic metabolism in vivo with minimal perturbation of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism is unfortunately not available at this time.",
                        "There remains a need in the art for non-invasive methods of tracking and measuring hepatic mitochondrial metabolism. In certain embodiments, these methods can be used to assess and evaluate the efficacy of novel therapies targeting hepatic mitochondrial activity. The present invention meets these needs."

To validate this method independent cross-validation studies were performed, with an excellent correlation (P<10\u221215, R2=0.99) between VPC/VCS calculated using the PINTA method of the invention and previous ex vivo NMR tracer technique in rats, and similar VPC/VCS ratios measured in healthy human subjects using two independent tracer methods (infusion of [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]acetate).",

Taken together, these data demonstrated that the PINTA method is sensitive to differences in hepatic mitochondrial flux rates in various physiologic and pathophysiologic states in both humans and rodent models of diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver sisease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other metabolic diseases. Furthermore, this method is useful for assessing target engagement for novel therapies that are currently being developed to promote increased hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH and type-2 diabetes (T2D)."

Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, the fractional enrichment of glucose from 13CO2 can be increased from PC synthesis of [4-13C]OAA from 13CO2 and pyruvate.

Prior to studies, rats underwent surgery under general isoflurane anesthesia to place polyethylene catheters in the jugular vein and common carotid artery (PE90 and PE50 tubing, respectively; Instech, Plymouth Meeting, Pa.).

In this calculation it is assumed that the flux from PC will continue through PEPCK and subsequent gluconeogenic reactions, and end up in liver glucose. This will be a maximum estimate of the PC contribution due to the possibility of futile cycling where PEP is converted by pyruvate kinase into pyruvate. Previous in vivo animal and human studies suggest that VPK+ME flux is relatively low compared to VPC flux under fasting conditions. Consistent with these prior studies VPK+ME flux/VPC+PDH flux is relatively low (<15%) under several physiologic conditions and that these low rates of pyruvate cycling have a minimal impact on the estimated VPC/VCS ratio, as determined by a formula that takes this flux into account [formula (30)], the derivation of which is presented in the section \u201cExpanded derivation of VPC/VCS.\u201d",

                                "In order to validate this method, the ratio of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux to hepatic citrate synthase flux (VPC/VCS) was measured using two methods following a steady-state infusion of [3-13C]lactate and [3-3H]glucose, comparing data obtained using a previously established ex vivo NMR analysis to the newly developed PINTA analysis (Tables 1-2) in seven groups of rats undergoing various physiological perturbations which could alter hepatic mitochondrial activity: 1) control chow fed rats, 2) insulin resistant high fat-fed rats, 3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamped rats, 4) glucagon infused rats, 5) epinephrine infused rats, 6) malic enzyme inhibitor treated rats and 7) liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupler (CRMP) treated rats. Using this approach, a 1:1 correlation (FIG. 1; R2=0.99, slope=0.98) for VPC/VCS was observed using these two methods. Both methods rely on a similar small set of assumptions, including having reached steady state in the metabolites of interest and negligible enrichment in [1-13C]pyruvate, alanine, and acetyl-CoA. These assumptions in the current study were validated by demonstrating stability of glucose enrichment in both rats and humans (FIGS. 6B and 7A) and confirming minimal hepatic bicarbonate enrichment (1.5\u00b10.1%).",
                                "Next, the PINTA and ex vivo NMR methods were used to calculate the ratio of VPC/VEGP. A strong correlation (FIG. 2; R2=0.84, slope=0.92) between ratios calculated was observed using the two methods in all groups of rats. The calculation of this flux required a different but related set of assumptions. PINTA measurement of VPC/VEGP assumes, in addition to achievement of steady state, a binomial probability analysis describing the distribution of 13C-glucose isotopomers resulting from the synthesis of two 13C-labeled trioses, and the presence of just one gluconeogenic precursor pool enrichment. The ex vivo NMR method assumes the presence of rapidly equilibrating small pools in the TCA cycle that are unperturbed by the tracer, complete equilibration of C2 and C3 OAA, and that the enrichment of malate reflects that of OAA. The strong correlation between two methods with differing assumptions supports the applicability of each method. Taken together these data demonstrate that the analysis of glucose by the PINTA method (Tables 1-2) closely approximates the VPC/VCS and VPC/VEGP ratios measured using an invasive method that requires rapidly snap freezing 3-4 gram of liver tissue in rodents that have been anesthetized within 10 seconds of intravenously administered anesthesia.",
                                "A non-limiting goal of this report is to present a non-invasive method to measure hepatic oxidative and gluconeogenic fluxes that can be applied to humans. To examine the potential of PINTA to serve this purpose, two independent and complementary methods were used to calculate the ratio of VPc/VCS in humans infused with [1-13C]acetate and [3-13C]lactate in separate studies. The studies demonstrate that PINTA measures the ratio VPC/VCS similar to that determined using in vivo NMR analysis.",
                                "Next, in order to confirm the sensitivity of PINTA measurements to expected changes in mitochondrial flux rates, a validation study was performed utilizing treatment with a liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling agent, CRMP, which can selectively increase rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in vivo without inducing hyperthermia or any associated hepatic or systemic toxicities. As compared to vehicle-treated control rats, animals treated with CRMP exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in hepatic VCS flux consistent with its effects to increase hepatic tricarboxylic acid cycle activity through uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation activity. This 2.5-fold increase in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation induced by CRMP was associated with a \u02dc70% reduction in the VPC/VCS ratio and \u02dc10% and \u02dc30% reductions in rates of endogenous glucose production and VPC flux, respectively (Table 7). Finally, VPC/VEGP flux was examined in glycogen-repleted rats fasted for 6 hrs and this ratio was compared to glycogen depleted rats fasted for 48 hr. An extended fast increased VPC/VEGP flux six-fold, consistent with a shift in reliance upon increased mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase flux for glucose production in the absence of hepatic glycogen. These data demonstrate that the PINTA method is sufficiently sensitive to detect expected differences in both relative and absolute VPC/VCS fluxes as well as in the ratio VPC/VEGP with previously characterized physiologic perturbations.",
                                "The selection of isotope is always a critical factor in any tracer metabolic study and [3-13C]lactate has many advantages over other stable isotopes that have been used to assess hepatic mitochondrial and glucose metabolism. First, plasma lactate concentrations are 10-100 fold greater than the plasma concentrations of glycerol, acetate or propionate and therefore significant 13C enrichment in hepatic lactate and its intrahepatocellular metabolites can be achieved without significantly perturbing whole body lactate metabolism. Furthermore, compared to glycerol, acetate and propionate, lactate has the lowest periportal-perivenous gradient across the liver bed and therefore hepatocellular flux determinations using this isotope are least impacted by any heterogeneity of mixing of tracer between periportal and perivenous hepatocytes. In addition, the minimal impact of [3-13C]lactate on hepatic metabolism stands in contrast to [U-13C]propionate which, when administered at doses commonly used to trace hepatic mitochondrial metabolism in human and animal studies, markedly increases concentrations of plasma propionate and of hepatic propionyl-CoA and TCA cycle intermediates. As a potent allosteric activator of pyruvate carboxylase, increased propionyl-CoA may lead to profound alterations in hepatic mitochondrial fluxes. In contrast [3-13C]lactate can be infused at a rate that provides sufficient label to measure hepatic mitochondrial fluxes without significantly altering hepatocellular mitochondrial metabolites/fluxes. Because of its reliance on the assumption that pyruvate cycling is minimal the PINTA method would be of limited utility in settings where pyruvate kinase (PK) and/or malic enzyme (ME) flux is high relative to pyruvate carboxylase flux. However, rates of VPK+ME flux were found to be very low compared to rates of VPC+PDH flux in healthy control subjects and insulin resistant subjects with NAFLD following an overnight fast. Consistent with these prior studies, VPK+ME flux relative to VPC+PDH flux is less than 6% in overnight fasted rodents (Table 1); using a complete equation including these fluxes it was found to have minimal impact on the estimates of VPC and VCS fluxes. Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, this finding makes teleological sense in that rates of hepatic glycolysis (VPK) would be expected to be minimal relative to rates of VPC flux under fasting conditions in order to provide maximal net flux through gluconeogenesis to support obligate glucose-utilizing organs like the CNS while minimizing energy dissipation due to futile cycling. However, under other conditions such as hyperthyroidism, which significantly increases rates of hepatic pyruvate cycling due to increased VME flux, as well as under hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic conditions, when rates of hepatic glycolysis would be expected to be significantly increased, it is necessary to adjust these PINTA determined rates of VPC/VCS flux accordingly using equation (30).",
                                "The use of the PINTA method to measure VPC flux also has advantages over the 2H2O method to measure gluconeogenic flux rates. In addition to the improved specificity afforded by measuring VPC instead of total gluconeogenesis, infusion of [3-13C]lactate is practically simpler for both investigator and subject: the 2H2O method requires dosing of 2H2O several hours prior to assessment of gluconeogenesis in order to allow adequate time for 2H2O equilibration in the whole-body water space. Furthermore, 2H2O administration is often associated with dizziness, nystagmus, nausea and occasional vomiting, which can be a limiting factor in the clinical setting.",
                                "The present disclosure describes a non-invasive (PINTA) method to measure rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux in vivo during an infusion of [3-13C]lactate in combination with a glucose tracer to assess rates of endogenous glucose production. This method will provide investigators with a simple and widely available means of examining the role of altered hepatic mitochondrial and glucose metabolism in various physiologic and pathophysiologic states in humans and rodent models of diabetes as well as to examine target engagement for novel therapies that are currently being developed to promote increased rates of hepatic fatty acid oxidation for the treatment of NASH and type 2 diabetes."

                                "Mammals have evolved robust mechanisms to maintain sufficient substrate supply to meet the prodigious energy demands of the brain during starvation. Chief among them is a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism to preserve essential protein stores necessary for survival that would otherwise be catabolized for gluconeogenesis. In the transition from the fed to the early fasted state, there is a shift from substrate absorption to hepatic glycogenolysis and de novo synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, such as lactate, alanine, and glycerol (gluconeogenesis). In contrast, in the prolonged fasted state, when hepatic glycogen stores have been depleted, hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis supply substrate to the brain and other obligate glucose utilizers, such as erythrocytes and the renal medulla. The shift from glucose metabolism to fat and ketone metabolism is thought to be primarily orchestrated by a decrease in plasma insulin concentrations and, to a lesser extent, an increase in plasma glucagon concentrations, which in turn are thought to modulate hepatic gluconeogenesis principally by the transcriptional regulation of key unidirectional enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-biphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase by forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1a), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4a), and other factors.",
                                "Prolonged starvation has also been shown to reduce plasma leptin concentrations in both humans and mice, which in turn has been shown to alter reproductive, thyroid, and adrenal function. However, the effect of starvation-induced hypoleptinemia on glucose and fat metabolism has not been conclusively demonstrated. In this regard, it is possible that hypoleptinemia may be a critical signal to increase white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased hepatic acetyl-CoA content and pyruvate carboxylase activity, thereby maintaining glucose homeostasis and increasing hepatic ketogenesis during starvation.",
                                "In order to address this hypothesis, a positional isotopomer nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tracer analysis (PINTA) method (see Example 1) was used to assess in vivo rates of mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) and mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) along with stable isotope infusions to assess rates of whole-body glucose turnover, WAT lipolysis, hepatic ketogenesis, glucose-alanine cycling, and glucose-lactate cycling in awake rats during the transition from the fed state to the prolonged fasted state. Using this comprehensive metabolic approach, it has been shown that hypoleptinemia drives a glucose-fatty acid cycle mediated by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in increased rates of WAT lipolysis, b-oxidation, ketogenesis, and hepatic acetyl-CoA content, which are necessary to maintain glucose homeostasis and adequate substrate supply to the brain during prolonged starvation.",

Unless otherwise specified, rats were fed a regular chow diet (Harlan Teklad #2018, Indianapolis, Ind.) throughout, and fasted as described below. High fat fed rats were given ad lib access to a safflower oil-based high fat diet containing 60% calories from fat (Dyets #112245, Bethlehem, Pa.) for 4 weeks prior to sacrifice, before which they were fasted as described above. In order to induce T1D, rats were injected with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg IP, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) 24 hr prior to the start of a leptin infusion study and were fasted overnight 12 hr after streptozotocin injection. T1D was confirmed by the combination of hyperglycemia (>17 mM) and insulinopenia (<30 pM) after the overnight fast; all rats that did not meet both criteria (\u02dc25% of those injected with streptozotocin) were excluded from analysis.",
                                "Rats were randomly assigned to fasting time points following a 24 hr fast-refeeding protocol designed to maximize whole-body glycogen content prior to the fast, as occurs following a large meal. The feeding and fasting times for each group of rats are listed in Table 8.",
                                "Following the fasting period designated, rats underwent studies as described in the following sections.

All tracers were infused through a catheter placed \u02dc1 week prior in the carotid artery, and blood was obtained from a catheter in the jugular vein. Measurements of portal vein glucose concentrations were performed on blood samples taken from a catheter in the portal vein; unless otherwise specified, all blood was drawn from the jugular vein. All studies began 1 hr after catheters were connected, reducing any impact of stress from handling on the physiology assessed.",

Tracer infusion rates are shown in Table 9. A bolus of [6,6-14C]2-deoxyglucose was administered in 48 hr fasted control rats and 48 hr fasted rats infused with glucose to increase plasma glucose concentrations to 6 mM and gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal white adipose tissue were harvested and processed to determine basal glucose uptake in both tissues by comparing the plasma [14C] specific activity decay curve to tissue [14C] specific activity, both measured using a scintillation counter.",

Blood samples were taken at 43.5, 45, 46.5, and 48 hr for measurement of substrate/hormone concentrations and turnover of each tracer, as described below. In the T1D leptin dose response studies, overnight (12 hr) fasted rats were infused with stepwise increasing dose of leptin during the same tracer infusion as described above.

Blood samples were obtained before (time zero) and 120 min after treatment with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor for measurement of turnover rates and plasma hormone/substrate concentrations. Hepatic acetyl-CoA content was altered by treatment with a CPT-1 inhibitor (etomoxir, 8 mg/kg) or an ATGL inhibitor (atglistatin, 200 mmol/kg) in 0, 6, 16, and 48 hr fasted rats. Both agents were solubilized by suspending the drug in 4% ethanol/96% normal saline, heating to 60\u00b0 C., and sonicating, and were cooled to room temperature before they were injected intraperitoneally. Intra-arterial infusion of a small amount of glucose was required to avoid hypoglycemia in 48 hr fasted, atglistatin-treated rats. In these animals plasma glucose concentrations were measured every 15 minutes and a variable infusion of 20% glucose (Pfizer Hospira, Lake Forest, Ill.) was used to maintain plasma glucose concentrations \u02dc3.6-3.7 mM. The physiologic role of glucocorticoids was assessed in 6 and 48 hr fasted rats by treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone. Following a 2 hr tracer infusion at the rates described above to assess fatty acid, glycerol, glucose, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate turnover, rats were injected with mifepristone (40 mg/kg) IV. The tracer infusion was continued and the tracer of each of the above substrates was again measured 2 hr after treatment with mifepristone.",

In order to match plasma glucose concentrations to those of 16 hr fasted rats, a variable infusion of glucose was begun through an arterial catheter in the same rats, with plasma glucose concentrations checked every 15 min and adjusted to maintain plasma glucose concentrations \u02dc6.0 mM. With the glucose infusion continuing, a tracer dose of [6,6-14C2]2-deoxyglucose was administered through a venous catheter and tissue glucose uptake was determined as described below. In the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, glucose turnover was measured during a basal infusion of [1,2,3,4,5,6,6-2H7]glucose as described above. A primed-continuous infusion of Regular insulin (prime 40 mU/kg, continuous infusion rate 4 mU/[kg-min]) was initiated for 150 min, during which plasma glucose concentrations were measured every 10-15 min and a variable infusion of 20% glucose (2.5% [1,2,3,4,5,6,6-2H7] enriched) was infused to maintain euglycemia (\u02dc6 pM).

All chemicals used for flux analysis were obtained from SIGMA. Turnover of glucose, glycerol, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Briefly, both glucose and glycerol were deprotonized with 5 volumes of methanol, derivitized with 3 volumes of 1:1 acetic anhydride:pyridine, heated to 65\u00b0 C. for 20 min, and 1 volume of methanol was added, then GC-MS was used in CI mode to measure glucose enrichment and EI mode to measure glycerol enrichment, with turnover calculated using the equation above. \u03b2-Hydroxybutyrate was deprotonized with 5 volumes of methanol and derivitized with 3 volumes of n-butanol 4N HCl, after which the samples were heated to 65\u00b0 C. for 60 min, evaporated under N2 gas, and re-suspended in 100 mL of trifluoroacetic acid:methylene chloride (1:7). Fatty acid turnover was measured by determining the plasma palmitate enrichment by GC-MS. Samples were prepared for measurements of palmitate enrichment by evaporating 25 mL plasma, dissolving in 750 mL 1:1 chloroform:methanol and derivitizing with 250 mL boron trifluoride/methanol, then heating to 100\u00b0 C. for 5 min, adding 2 mL pentane and 1 mL water, and centrifuging at low speed for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to another vial, dissolved, and resuspended in 100 mL hexane for measurement of palmitate enrichment by GC-MS (CI mode). the percent fatty acids (30%-40% in each study) comprised by palmitate was then corrected for, in order to measure total fatty acid turnover. Alanine turnover was determined in rats infused with [2,3,3,3-2H4]alanine by preparing samples to measure alanine enrichment by GC/MS (CI mode) using the same protocol as was employed to measure \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate enrichment. GC-MS was then used to determine the m+4 alanine enrichment (retention time \u02dc4.1 min, m/z 242 [m0], 243 [m+1], 244 [m+2], 245 [m+3], 246 [m+4]). Lactate turnover was determined in rats infused with [3-13C]lactate by performing the same extraction as for alanine and measuring the m+1 lactate enrichment (retention time \u02dc2.8 min, m/z 243 [m0] and 244 [m+1]). VPC and VCS flux rates were determined by PINTA in rats infused with [3-13C]lactate at the rates described above. Flux analysis was performed in rats confirmed post-absorptive (\u22658 hr fasted) based on the absence of a portal-systemic glucose gradient (FIG. 10B).

Absolute VPC flux was measured by multiplying the VPC/VEGP ratio by the VEGP (whole-body glucose turnover) measured by dilution of [2H7] glucose. Absolute VCS flux was calculated by dividing VPC by the ratio VPC/VCS. Rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis were calculated by measuring liver glycogen concentrations at the time points indicated and at one hour before or after the relevant time point. Assuming a constant rate of glycogenolysis during that hour, glycogenolysis rates were calculated by measuring the difference in liver glycogen between these time points and dividing by 60 min. The contribution of glycerol to gluconeogenesis was calculated as the difference between EGP and the sum of VPC and the rate of net hepatic glycogenolysis. The VPDH/VCS flux was measured as the ratio of [4,5-13C2]glutamate/[13C3]alanine in liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), kidney, WAT, and BAT after a 2 hr infusion of [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]glucose (16.7 umol/[kg-min] prime for 5 min, 5.6 umol/[kg-min] continuous infusion).

                                "Following food removal, plasma glucose concentrations progressively declined despite minimal differences in body weight and rats were found to be post-absorptive at 8 hr of fasting, as indicated by the absence of a glucose concentration gradient between the portal vein and the jugular vein (FIGS. 9A, 10A, and 10B). This progressive reduction in plasma glucose concentrations in the early post-absorptive state (8-16 hr) could be entirely attributed to reductions in rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis, as reflected by the strong correlation between plasma glucose concentrations and rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis (R2=0.96, p=0.003) (FIG. 9B and FIGS. 10C-10F). In contrast, plasma glucose concentrations were dissociated from rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which increased between 8 and 16 hr but decreased between 16 and 48 hr (FIG. 9B). In addition, the progressive reduction in rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis during the fast was associated with a shift from glucose to fat/ketone oxidation, demonstrated by fasting duration-dependent reductions in the ratio of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux to citrate synthase flux (VPDH/VCS) in liver, kidney (cortex), skeletal muscle, WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), heart, and brain (FIG. 9C).",
                                "Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glycerol, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased progressively throughout the fast (FIGS. 10G-10I). During starvation, plasma triglyceride (TAG) concentrations were reduced at 48 hr of fasting, whereas liver TAG and diacylglycerol (DAG) content were increased. This increase in hepatic DAG content was associated with increased protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC\u03b5) translocation (FIGS. 10J-10M), which in turn was associated with reduced percent suppression of endogenous glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (FIGS. 10N-10P). The dissociation between plasma and liver TAG can likely be explained in part by increased hepatic esterification of fatty acids into hepatic TAG driven by increased WAT lipolysis combined with reduced hepatic TAG export, which may be in part attributed to reductions in liver apolipoprotein B (ApoB) concentrations (FIG. 10Q). Similarly, skeletal muscle TAG content increased in fasted rats as the fast progressed (FIG. 10R). In addition, there was no change in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) expression with starvation, and gluconeogenic enzyme (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphatase) expression did not correlate with the measured changes in gluconeogenic flux (FIGS. 10S-10W).",
                                "The reduction in plasma glucose concentrations that occurred as the fast progressed was accompanied by reductions in plasma insulin concentrations and increases in plasma glucagon concentrations (FIGS. 11A and 11B). Plasma leptin concentrations decreased by 80% between fed and 48-hr fasted rats; this was associated with activation of the HPA axis, as indicated by increases in plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and corticosterone concentrations (FIGS. 9D, 9E, 11C, and 11D). Corticosteroid-binding globulin also increased modestly, but there were no differences in plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations and a transient increase in plasma growth hormone concentration after a short-term, but not a long-term, fast (FIGS. 11E-11H). Consistent with previous reports, starvation was also associated with an increase in plasma fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) concentrations (Kim and Lee, Diabetes Metab. J. 38, 245-251, 2014; Kliewer and Mangelsdorf, Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 91, 254S-257S, 2010) (FIG. 11I) and a reduction in plasma triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations (Flier et al., J. Clin. Invest. 105, 859-861, 2000) (FIG. 11J). In contrast to in lean-chow-fed rats, plasma leptin, corticosterone, NEFA, and ketone concentrations did not change significantly with a 48-hr fast in hyperleptinemic, diet-induced obese rats (FIGS. 11K-11N).",
                                "To more specifically investigate the impact of reductions in net hepatic glycogenolysis on rates of endogenous glucose production, plasma leptin concentrations, and activation of the HPA axis, post-absorptive rats fasted for 8, 16, and 48 hr were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase. Inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis lowered plasma glucose, lactate, and insulin concentrations and whole-body glucose turnover in the short-term (8 and 16 hr) fasted rats, but not in the 48-hr fasted rats, consistent with the negligible contributions that hepatic glycogenolysis would be expected to have on plasma glucose concentrations in this glycogen-depleted state (FIGS. 9F and 11O-11R). The reductions in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in 8- and 16-hr fasted rats treated with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor were associated with reductions in plasma leptin concentrations and increases in HPA axis activity, as reflected by increases in plasma corticosterone and ACTH concentrations in these groups (FIGS. 9G, 9H, and 11S). In contrast, plasma glucagon and catecholamine concentrations were not altered by treatment with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor, despite increased plasma FGF-21 concentrations in 8 and 16-hr fasted rats (FIGS. 11T-11W).",
                                "**Physiologic Leptin Replacement Suppresses Lipolysis and Reduces Plasma Glucose, but Supraphysiologic Leptin Stimulates Lipolysis and Increases Plasma Glucose**",
                                "In order to explore the physiologic role of the reductions in plasma leptin concentrations associated with prolonged starvation on the HPA axis, WAT lipolysis, and hepatic gluconeogenesis, leptin was infused into 48-hr fasted rats at three infusion rates. The infusion rates were designed to increase plasma leptin to physiologic concentrations observed in a 16-hr fast (\u02dc60 pM) to concentrations similar to those observed in obese rats (FIG. 11K) and in fed rats (\u02dc150 pM) and to supraphysiologic concentrations (\u02dc1250 pM) similar to or lower than those measured with leptin infusion in previous (FIG. 12A). Physiologic leptin replacement (\u02dc60 pM) lowered plasma glucose concentrations and hepatic glucose production, requiring an infusion of glucose to prevent hypoglycemia and counter-regulation. Infusions of leptin to raise plasma leptin concentrations to \u02dc150 pM and \u02dc1250 pM were unable to lower either parameter (FIGS. 12B, 12C, and 13A). The reductions in plasma glucose concentrations with physiologic leptin replacement (plasma leptin concentration, \u02dc60 pM) and increases in plasma glucose concentrations with supraphysiologic leptin treatment (plasma leptin concentrations, \u02dc150 pM and \u02dc1250 pM) were mirrored in suppression of plasma NEFA, glycerol, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate concentrations with physiologic leptin replacement and increases with supraphysiologic leptin infusions (FIGS. 13B-13E). Consistent with leptin's effect to suppress HPA axis activity, plasma corticosterone was suppressed by all three infusion rates of leptin. However, plasma catecholamine concentrations increased dose dependently with increasing leptin infusion, with the highest infusion rate of leptin raising plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations 2- to 3-fold (FIGS. 12D-12F). Plasma insulin concentrations also increased at the highest dose of leptin, most likely secondary to the increased rates of hepatic glucose production and resultant hyperglycemia. In contrast, there was no difference in plasma growth hormone concentrations (FIGS. 13F and 13G). However, leptin infusion caused a dose-dependent reduction in plasma FGF-21 concentrations, suggesting that the increase in plasma FGF-21 concentrations observed in fasted rats was secondary to hypoleptinemia and the resulting changes in the HPA axis, WAT lipolysis, and hepatic fat oxidation (FIG. 13H). Both fatty acid and glycerol turnover were suppressed with physiologic leptin replacement in 48-hr fasted rats and increased with supraphysiologic leptin treatment, resulting in increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content and (3-hydroxybutyrate turnover (FIGS. 12G-12J and 13I).",
                                "To examine the potential insulin dependence of the ability of leptin to suppress HPA-axis-mediated WAT lipolysis under physiologic conditions but promote WAT lipolysis under supraphysiologic conditions, leptin dose-response studies were conducted. A severely insulinopenic streptozotocin-induced rat model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) that almost entirely lack plasma leptin was used. Similar to what was observed in the starved normal rats, physiologic leptin replacement (\u02dc60 pM) in the T1D rats promoted a marked reduction in plasma glucose concentrations and endogenous glucose production rates, but supraphysiologic leptin concentrations (\u02dc1300 pM) promoted increases in both plasma glucose concentrations and endogenous glucose production (FIGS. 13J-13M). Both doses of leptin suppressed HPA axis activity, but supraphysiologic leptin concentrations (\u02dc1300 pM) were associated with a 4-fold increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations without any change in growth hormone concentrations (FIGS. 13N-13R). These alterations in HPA axis activity and catecholamine concentrations were associated with suppression of WAT lipolysis in T1D rats infused with leptin to achieve physiologic replacement leptin concentrations (\u02dc60 pM), an effect which was abrogated in rats infused with leptin to reach supraphysiologic plasma leptin concentrations (\u02dc1300 pM) (FIGS. 13S-13U).",

                                "Having observed that variations in plasma leptin concentrations are associated with alterations in plasma glucocorticoid and catecholamine concentrations, as well as WAT lipolysis, we next asked how WAT lipolysis changes during the fast. Using stable isotope ([13C16]palmitate, [2H5]glycerol, and [13C4] \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate) infusions, we found a progressive increase in turnover of fatty acids, glycerol, and ketones (FIGS. 14A-14C and 16A). As predicted by the increase in \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate turnover observed with increasing duration of fasting, hepatic acetyl-CoA concentrations also increased as the fast progressed, whereas hepatic malonyl-CoA content was reduced by 75% between 6 and 16 hr of fasting, but did not change between the 16 and 48 hr time points (FIGS. 14D and 14E), suggesting that inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity by hepatic malonyl-CoA content reached a nadir by 16 hr of fasting. Next, to directly assess the impact of increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content on hepatic glucose metabolism, we treated rats fasted for 0, 6, 16, and 48 hr with etomoxir, a small-molecule inhibitor of CPT-1. In fasted rats, CPT-1 inhibition lowered plasma glucose and insulin concentrations and whole body glucose turnover associated with suppression of hepatic acetyl-CoA content and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate turnover despite increased WAT lipolysis and unchanged plasma lactate and hepatic malonyl-CoA concentrations (FIGS. 14F-14H and FIGS. 16B-16J). Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, this result is potentially a consequence of the reductions in plasma insulin concentrations observed with inhibition of CPT-1. To examine whether the reductions in plasma glucose and insulin measured with CPT-1 inhibition were associated with alterations in HPA axis activity, plasma leptin and corticosterone concentrations were measured. It was found that etomoxir treatment was associated with 50% reductions in plasma leptin concentrations, as well as increases in plasma corticosterone concentrations in 16- and 48-hr fasted rats (FIGS. 14I and 14J). In contrast, there were no differences in plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations (FIGS. 16K and 16L).",
                                "Next, to more directly assess the role of increased WAT lipolysis in the maintenance of hepatic gluconeogenesis by hepatic acetyl-CoA in starvation, rats were treated with atglistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Atglistatin treatment rapidly decreased plasma glucose concentrations in 16- and 48-hr fasted rats, and an infusion of glucose was required to avoid severe hypoglycemia due to suppression of WAT lipolysis and hepatic acetyl-CoA content in the latter group, despite unchanged plasma lactate, epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations and hepatic malonyl-CoA content (FIGS. 15A-15F and 17A-17I). As in etomoxir-treated rats, 16- and 48-hr fasted, atglistatin-treated rats exhibited reductions in plasma leptin and increases in plasma corticosterone concentration (FIGS. 15G and 15H), consistent with plasma glucose/insulin regulation of leptin release from the adipocyte. To assess whether increased plasma corticosterone concentrations were necessary to maintain euglycemia in the starved state, rats were treated with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone. Despite infusion of glucose to avoid hypoglycemia provoking a counter regulatory response, mifepristone treatment decreased plasma glucose concentrations, whole-body glucose turnover, WAT lipolysis, and ketogenesis in 48-hr fasted rats, but not in recently fed rats (FIGS. 18A-18G and 19A-19F). Finally, consistent with data in rats treated with etomoxir and atglistatin, the lower plasma glucose and insulin concentrations caused by treating 48-hr fasted rats with mifepristone were associated with a 60% reduction in plasma leptin concentrations (FIG. 18H). Taken together, these data demonstrate the key role for hepatic acetyl-CoA in supporting hepatic gluconeogenesis during starvation. Furthermore, they demonstrate the critical role for hypoleptinemia-mediated increases in HPA axis activity in promoting increased WAT lipolysis and hepatic ketogenesis in this process.",
                                "Reductions in Muscle Glucose-Alanine Cycling Promote Decreased Rates of Hepatic Mitochondrial Oxidation and Gluconeogenesis in the Prolonged (48 hr) Fasted State",
                                "Given the progressive increases in WAT lipolysis and hepatic acetyl-CoA content with increasing duration of the fast, it might be expected that hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) would also continue to increase with an extended fast. Instead, a \u02dc50% reduction in pyruvate carboxylase flux was observed between 16- and 48-hr fasted rats (FIG. 9B), despite a 15% increase in hepatic acetyl-CoA content during this time interval (FIG. 14D). To understand the reasons for the discordance between hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux and hepatic acetyl-CoA content, plasma concentrations and turnover rates were assessed for the two predominant gluconeogenic substrates (lactate and alanine). 65% reductions in rates of whole-body alanine turnover, as well as 35% reductions in hepatic alanine concentrations were observed between 16- and 48-hr fasted rats, associated with smaller reductions in lactate turnover and plasma amino acid concentrations (FIGS. 20A and 21A-21L). PINTA analysis of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation rates also revealed a 50% reduction in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) associated with reductions in liver citrate, malate, and succinate concentrations. Taken together, these data suggest that prolonged (48 hr) starvation led to reductions in glucose-alanine cycling, which in turn resulted in decreased hepatic mitochondrial anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, resulting in decreased rates of mitochondrial oxidation (FIGS. 20B, 20C, and 21M-21O). To test this hypothesis, alanine was infused in 48-hr fasted rats to match alanine turnover rates and hepatic alanine concentrations measured in 16-hr fasted rats (FIGS. 21P and 21Q). This intervention increased plasma glucose, insulin, and lactate concentrations; endogenous glucose production; and pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) associated with a 3-fold increase in plasma leptin concentrations but independent of any change in plasma glucagon (FIGS. 20D-20F and 21R-21U). In addition, normalizing alanine turnover increased liver tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate concentrations and rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) in 48-hr fasted rats independent of changes in plasma T3 concentrations (FIGS. 20G, 20H, and 21V-21Y).",
                                "Small Reductions in Plasma Glucose (6-5 mM) Suppress Muscle Glucose-Alanine Cycling During Prolonged (48 hr) Starvation",
                                "Subtle reductions in plasma glucose concentrations from 6 to 5 mM were hypothesized to promote hypoleptinemia, increase HPA axis activity, and reduce glucose-alanine cycling, as well as glucose-lactate cycling in the starved state. To test this, a low-dose glucose infusion was performed in 48-hr fasted rats to increase plasma glucose concentrations from 5 to 6 mM, as measured in 16-hr fasted rats (FIGS. 23A and 23B). This intervention increased plasma insulin concentrations by 75% and doubled plasma lactate concentrations while reducing plasma FGF-21 concentrations by 50%. Plasma NEFA concentrations and rates of endogenous glucose production were also reduced by 30-50% (FIGS. 22A, 22B, and 23C-23E). Increasing plasma glucose from 5 to 6 mM doubled both glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and whole-body alanine turnover (FIGS. 22C and 22D), increasing the latter to rates similar to those observed in 16-hr fasted rats. In addition, 48-hr fasted rats with plasma glucose concentrations \u02dc6 mM exhibited a 2-fold increase in WAT glucose uptake as compared to 48-hr fasted rats with plasma glucose \u02dc5 mM, doubling plasma leptin concentrations and suppressing HPA axis activity as reflected by 50%-60% reductions in plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations (FIGS. 22E-22H). Similarly, we found that treatment of short-term fasted rats (8 and 16 hr) with an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase resulted in hypoleptinemia and increased HPA axis activity, as well as increased rates of WAT lipolysis and decreased rates of alanine turnover (FIGS. 22I, 22J, and 23F-23J).",
                                "**Selected Discussion**",
                                "To prolong survival during an extended fast, mammals must shift from a primary reliance upon carbohydrate metabolism to a primary reliance upon fat and ketone metabolism in order to maintain adequate substrate supply to the brain, heart, and other organs, thus preserving essential protein stores that would otherwise be catabolized to support gluconeogenesis. While insulin and, to a lesser extent, glucagon have long been thought to be the major orchestrators of this transition from glucose to fat/ketone metabolism, the results presented herein demonstrate a leptin-mediated glucose-fatty acid cycle that is essential to support this process.",
                                "Consistent with previous in vivo 13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies of hepatic glycogen metabolism in humans, the fraction of glucose production from hepatic glycogenolysis decreased over the course of a 48-hr fast in lean rats, while gluconeogenesis rates remained relatively constant until rats reached a state of prolonged starvation at 48 hr, whereupon gluconeogenic flux decreases by \u02dc50%. Similar to data from fasting humans, hepatic glycogen concentrations in rats followed a pattern of exponential decay during fasting (FIG. 10D), and the reduction in rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis was the major determinant of the reduction in the rate of endogenous glucose production and plasma glucose concentration observed during a prolonged fast (FIGS. 9A-9C). To specifically test the physiologic impact of reductions in rates of hepatic glycogenolysis on leptin secretion, HPA axis activity, and WAT lipolysis, rats were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase. Consistent with a key role for hepatic glycogenolysis as the major determinant of endogenous glucose production and fasting plasma glucose concentrations in the early stages (0 to 16 hr) of the fast, 8- and 16-hr fasted rats treated with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor manifested rates of endogenous glucose production that were reduced by 60% and 30%, respectively (FIG. 9F). In contrast, 48-hr fasted rats treated with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor exhibited no difference in rates of endogenous glucose production, consistent with rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis being negligible by 48 hr of fasting.",
                                "In order to examine the ability of reductions in hepatic glycogenolysis to drive the HPA activation observed in the starved state, plasma lipolytic hormone concentrations and WAT lipolysis were assessed in rats treated with an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase. A reduction in plasma leptin concentrations and increases in plasma corticosterone concentrations and WAT lipolysis were observed, bringing each parameter to concentrations measured in 48-hr fasted rats despite unchanged plasma catecholamine concentrations in short-term fasted rats treated with the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor (FIGS. 9G, 9H, 22J, 11S, 11U, 11V, and 23F-23J). These results suggest that hypoleptinemia-driven HPA axis activation could promote increased hepatic gluconeogenic flux by increasing WAT lipolysis, resulting in increased fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic acetyl-CoA content to maintain euglycemia during prolonged (\u226516 hr) fasting. Consistent with this hypothesis, both WAT lipolysis and hepatic acetyl-CoA content increased with increasing duration of the fast. Interestingly, these increases in WAT lipolysis were also associated with the development of severe hepatic steatosis, increases in hepatic DAG content, hepatic PKC\u03b5 activation, and impaired percent suppression of endogenous glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (FIGS. 10K-10P). These results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that increased fatty acid delivery to the liver can promote increased hepatic esterification and hepatic TAG synthesis in an insulin-independent fashion, as well as a causal role for hepatic DAG activation of PKC\u03b5 in hepatic insulin resistance, through increased insulin receptor kinase threonine 1160 (murine 1150) phosphorylation.",
                                "In contrast to ectopic lipid content, which increased progressively through the fast, hepatic malonyl-CoA decreased between 6 and 16 hr of the fast, facilitating mitochondrial b-oxidation by reducing inhibition of CPT-1. To further examine the potential role of increasing hepatic acetyl-CoA concentrations in the maintenance of hepatic gluconeogenesis and endogenous glucose production, we treated rats with two agents to directly modulate hepatic acetyl-CoA content: ATGL inhibitor atglistatin and CPT-1 inhibitor etomoxir. Despite different mechanisms of action, both agents suppressed hepatic acetyl-CoA content, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in 16- to 48-hr fasted rats, thus demonstrating a critical role for hepatic acetyl-CoA content in the maintenance of hepatic gluconeogenesis during starvation.",
                                "Taken together, these data challenge the canonical view of the primacy of insulinopenia-mediated transcriptional and/or translational regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes in increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and maintaining euglycemia in starvation. Although PEPCK protein expression increased progressively during the fast, hepatic gluconeogenesis from oxaloacetate was reduced by 50% from 16 to 48 hr due to substrate limitation (FIGS. 9B, 20E, and 20F) in the setting of unchanged pyruvate carboxylase protein expression. These data raise the question of whether insulinopenia per se promotes WAT lipolysis and increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content in the starved state or whether other factors such as HPA axis activation (FIG. 9D) are also required.",
                                "To answer that question, mifepristone, a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, was administered to rats fasted for 6 and 48 hr. Although mifepristone had no impact on WAT lipolysis, whole body glucose turnover, or plasma glucose or insulin concentrations in recently fed rats (6 hr), inhibition of glucocorticoid action markedly suppressed each of these parameters, necessitating glucose infusion to avoid severe hypoglycemia and counter-regulation in prolonged (48 hr) fasted rats (FIG. 18). Because mifepristone treatment suppressed WAT lipolysis in the setting of reductions in plasma insulin concentrations, these data suggest that severe insulinopenia per se is not sufficient to promote increased WAT lipolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis in starved rats. To further test the role of HPA axis activation and, specifically, the role of hypoleptinemia in driving this process, leptin was infused in a stepwise fashion to increase plasma leptin concentrations in 48-hr fasted rats to: (1) physiologic concentrations typical of overnight-fasted, chow-fed rats (\u02dc60 pM), (2) modestly elevated concentrations similar to those of high-fat fed (HFD) rats (\u02dc150 pM) (FIG. 11K), and (3) supraphysiologic concentrations (\u02dc1300 pM) similar to or lower than those measured in previous systemic leptin infusion studies in the literature. This study demonstrated that physiologic leptin replacement suppressed HPA axis activity, WAT lipolysis, hepatic acetyl-CoA content, and rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis in 48-hr fasted rats without altering plasma insulin concentrations, thereby demonstrating that insulinopenia per se is not sufficient to increase WAT lipolysis, hepatic acetyl-CoA content, and hepatic gluconeogenesis during starvation.",
                                "To further examine the role of insulin in mediating leptin's effect on WAT lipolysis, leptin dose-response studies were performed in a severely insulinopenic streptoztocin-induced rat model of T1D that is also severely leptinopenic. These data demonstrate the impact of the absence of leptin: with plasma leptin concentrations only \u02dc12 pM (92% lower than fed rats) and severe insulinopenia (99% lower than fed rats), both WAT lipolysis and endogenous glucose production rates were markedly increased. Physiologic leptin replacement suppressed endogenous glucose production and WAT lipolysis in T1D rats (FIGS. 13J-13U), consistent with previous studies. However, in both fasting normal control rats and T1D rats, supraphysiologic leptin concentrations promoted increased catecholamine release, increasing WAT lipolysis and abrogating leptin's effect to lower rates of endogenous glucose production and plasma glucose concentrations. These data are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that leptin activates catecholamine synthesis, catecholamine signaling, and energy expenditure. Further, the ability of leptin to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, WAT lipolysis, and hepatic glucose production at plasma concentrations \u2265150 pM may explain the failure of previous studies to observe an effect of leptin to reduce hyperglycemia in fasted insulinopenic diabetic rodents through suppression of HPA axis activity. Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, hypoleptinemia-induced activation of HPA axis activity may not occur universally in starvation as was observed in 4-week HFD obese rats (FIGS. 11K-11N). In contrast to regular chow-fed lean control rats, HFD obese hyperleptinemic rats did not manifest reductions in plasma leptin concentrations and increases in HPA activity during 48 hr of fasting (FIGS. 11K-11N). This may explain why starvation-induced reductions in plasma leptin concentrations and increases in HPA activity have not always been observed in human studies. In contrast to young lean rodents, which have minimal fat mass after a 48-hr fast, most normal weight human subjects will still have substantial fat mass even after several days of starvation, which would not be expected to decrease plasma leptin concentrations to the critical threshold that maybe required to activate the HPA axis. In contrast, patients with anorexia nervosa often develop severe hypoleptinemia (due to depleted fat stores) which is associated with activation of the HPA axis and hypercortisolemia, suggesting that under conditions of severe depletion of adipose tissue mass, leptin may decrease sufficiently with starvation to activate HPA axis driven WAT lipolysis. In contrast, in overweight subjects or those undergoing caloric restriction instead of fasting in whom leptin may not be reduced sufficiently to produce increased HPA activity, this mechanism may not be as relevant or may take a longer time to occur in order to deplete the larger fat mass in these overweight/obese individuals. Consistent with this possibility, several recent studies do show an association between hypoleptinemia and increased plasma cortisol concentrations in high-normal weight humans during caloric deprivation. In addition, it is possible that the relative importance of insulinopenia- and hypoleptinemia-induced HPA axis activation in driving the shift from glucose to fat metabolism may differ between rodents and humans; in contrast to rodents, insulinopenia may be sufficient to produce most or all of the effect of starvation to increase WAT lipolysis in humans independent of increases in plasma cortisol concentrations.",
                                "Several reports suggest that in lean and obese human subjects, plasma leptin concentrations decrease during caloric restriction out of proportion to the decline in total body weight or fat mass and increase with refeeding or long-term hyperinsulinemia, consistent with the data presented herein (FIGS. 9D, 22F, and 10A). These data pose the question of whether starvation regulates plasma leptin concentrations by an alternative mechanism in addition to reductions in total fat mass. Consistent with this possibility, acute treatment with inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase, CPT-1, ATGL, and the glucocorticoid receptor all reduced plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin concentrations within just 2 hr, a time frame incompatible with similar reductions in body weight. Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, it is possible that a reduction in plasma glucose concentrations from 6 to 5 mM and consequent reductions in plasma insulin concentrations from \u02dc100 to \u02dc45 pM during prolonged fasting reduce plasma leptin concentrations from \u02dc65 to \u02dc35 pM. A small increase in plasma glucose concentrations from 5 to 6 mM in 48-hr fasted rats doubled glucose uptake into WAT, doubled plasma leptin concentrations, and reduced plasma corticosterone concentrations by 50% (FIGS. 22E-22H). These data demonstrate that progressive reductions in plasma glucose concentrations during the fed to fasted transition in lean, normal chow-fed rats signals the depletion of stored hepatic carbohydrate (glycogen) reserves and results in reduced WAT leptin secretion, which in turn stimulates the HPA axis activity to promote increased WAT lipolysis and the transition from whole body glucose oxidation to fat/ketone oxidation.",
                                "Despite increased or unchanged WAT lipolysis and hepatic acetyl-CoA content between 16 and 48 hr of fasting, rats exhibited a \u02dc50% reduction in rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis after 48 hr of starvation. This result could be entirely attributed to reductions in rates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) between these time points (FIG. 9B). It is possible that reductions in alanine turnover, which was observed in 48-hr starved rodents (FIG. 20A) and which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a reduction in alanine release from the forearm in fasted humans, may be responsible for reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis due to substrate limitation. To test that hypothesis, rats were infused with alanine to increase total alanine turnover to match rates of alanine turnover measured in 16-hr fasted rats. This intervention increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, hepatic glucose production, and hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux similar to or greater than what was measured in 16-hr fasted rats. In addition, rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (citrate synthase flux, VCS)\u2014assessed by PINTA analysis-revealed suppression of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation flux (VCS) with 48 hr of fasting, but alanine replacement increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) independent of changes in plasma T3 concentrations (FIGS. 11J and 21Y). Taken together, these data reveal that reductions in alanine turnover during prolonged starvation cause suppression of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation rates. The reductions in alanine turnover observed in the starved state would be expected to promote further increases in hepatic ketogenesis due to an expanding mismatch between rates of hepatic \u03b2-oxidation and hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS), thereby providing increased ketones to serve as a substrate for brain mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, supplying \u02dc45% of the brain's energy needs after 48 hr of starvation (FIG. 9C). The reductions in alanine turnover observed in the starved state were confirmed to result from reductions in plasma glucose concentrations from 6 to 5 mM: infusion of glucose to raise plasma glucose concentrations from 5 to 6 mM in 48-hr fasted rats increased whole-body alanine turnover to rates similar to those measured in 16-hr fasted rats (FIG. 22D). In summary, these data reveal several new concepts regarding leptin biology and the regulation of whole-body and tissue-specific substrate metabolism from the transition from the fed to fasted state in normal lean free-ranging rats, specifically:",
                                "(1) Progressive decreases in plasma glucose (9 to 6 mM) and insulin (500 to 100 pM) concentrations during early starvation (6-16 hr) can mostly be ascribed to reduced rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis (25 to 4 mmol/[kg, min]) because rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis during this period remain relatively constant, thus providing a systemic index of remaining stored hepatic carbohydrate (glycogen) reserves. This in turn promotes progressive reductions in plasma leptin concentrations (150 to 60 pM).",
                                "(2) Reductions in plasma leptin concentrations (150 to 60 pM) stimulate the HPA axis, thus increasing plasma corticosterone concentrations (100 to 450 nM), which, in the presence of hypoinsulinemia, results in stimulation of WAT lipolysis and the shift from whole-body carbohydrate oxidation to fat/ketone oxidation.",

                                "(6) Reductions in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) during prolonged (48 hr) starvation can be attributed in part to reductions in rates of hepatic anaplerosis (VPC).",

In contrast, supraphysiologic plasma leptin concentrations stimulate WAT lipolysis and result in increased rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia through activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased catecholamine secretion.",
                                "(8) Increased rates of WAT lipolysis promote increased hepatic fat (DAG) accumulation and PKC\u03b5 activation during prolonged (48 hr) starvation.",
                                "Based on these findings, but without intending to be limited to any particular theory, it is possible that fasting-induced hepatic steatosis and lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance may also play an important role in promoting survival during famine by minimizing hepatic glucose uptake and energy storage as glycogen, therefore sparing any ingested carbohydrate for the central nervous system and other obligate glucose-requiring tissues, thus providing an evolutionary basis for DAG-PKC\u03b5 induced hepatic insulin resistance. Taken together, these data show that both insulinopenia and hypoleptinemia are necessary for maintenance of euglycemia during short-term (6-16 hr) starvation in lean rats, with insufficient anaplerosis from glucose-alanine cycling limiting both hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial oxidation in prolonged (48 hr) starvation. These data further identify a novel leptin-mediated glucose-fatty acid cycle that integrates responses of the muscle, white adipose tissue, and liver to maintain adequate substrate supply to the brain to promote survival during starvation."

                                "Glucagon has long been considered to be one of the major drivers of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D), and glucagon-blocking therapies have been pursued as adjuncts to therapy for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glucagon antagonism using either antibodies against glucagon or its receptor, small molecule antagonists of the glucagon receptor, and antisense oligonucleotides to knock down expression of the glucagon receptor have all shown promising glucose-lowering effects in humans and in animal models of T2D. However, concerns have been raised regarding the potential of these agents to increase liver enzymes by an unknown mechanism. Conversely, a dual glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon receptor agonist has recently been shown in rodents and non-human primates to lower blood glucose concentrations, associated with increased energy expenditure and weight loss. Taken together, these data suggest a potential role for glucagon to promote hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation and suggest that a lack of glucagon action may suppress hepatic fat oxidation and predispose to ectopic hepatic lipid accumulation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",
                                "Glucagon is a well-known stimulator of both hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis; the former by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated activation of glycogen phosphorylase, and the latter believed to occur largely through transcriptional regulation. Hepatic calcium signaling is integral to transcriptional regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis: inhibition or deletion of liver Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) results in reduced gluconeogenic protein mRNA expression in mouse livers and associated reductions in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Similarly, it has been shown that knocking down InsP3R-I, the main hepatic isoform of the cytosolic calcium-regulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, reduced glucose production in isolated hepatocytes stimulated with glucagon, which can be attributed to downregulation of gluconeogenic gene expression due to calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator-2 (CRTC2).",

They were fed standard chow (Teklad #2018) and housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle in the Yale Animal Resources Center. To knock down ATGL in a liver-specific manner, an adeno-associated virus targeting ATGL (Vector BioLabs, 1012 gc per mouse) was administered by retro-orbital injection four weeks prior to studies. Male mice were used for in vivo studies, while female mice were used for in vitro studies, unless otherwise specified. One week prior to in vivo studies, mice underwent surgery under isoflurane anesthesia to place a catheter in the jugular vein. Post-surgical recovery was confirmed by regaining the pre-surgical body weight prior to any in vivo studies. They were fasted overnight, unless otherwise stated, prior to in vivo studies.

Only [1-13C]OAA (from the equilibration of [4-13C]OAA with fumarate) converted directly to PEP labels glucose (C3 and C4), since all 13CO2 of [4-13C]OAA is lost with flux through the TCA cycle.

Mitochondrial signals were monitored in Rhod-2 AM-loaded cells using stimulation with 100 nM Glucagon or 50 nM Vasopressin on a 40\u00d7 objective lens. Individual cell responses were normalized to their respective baseline Rhod-2 AM fluorescence values, and changes were expressed as Normalized \u0394 Fluorescence.",
                                "For in vitro glucose production and lipolysis studies, primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated by the Yale Liver Center. Following removal of cell debris by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, cells were plated on 6-well collagen-I coated dishes (4.0\u00d7105 cells/well) in 2 ml recovery media (DMEM High Glucose containing 10% FBS, 2% penicillin-streptomycin, 100 nM dexamethasone, 1 nM insulin, and 10 mM HEPES). After incubation for 6 hr at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2, the attached cells were washed once in 1\u00d7PBS and then incubated overnight in 2 ml Low Glucose Culture Media (DMEM Low Glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% penicillin-streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES for glucose production studies) or Serum Free Low Glucose Culture Media (DMEM Low Glucose supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid free BSA, 2% penicillin-streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES for lipolysis assays). The next morning, cells were washed twice in 1\u00d7PBS and culture media replaced with 2 mL glucose production media (DMEM Base Media supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid free BSA, 20 mM sodium lactate, 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) or Serum Free Low Glucose Culture Media (lipolysis assay) in the presence of 100 nM glucagon or vehicle control. After incubation for 8 hr at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2, cell culture media was collected for analysis of glucose, NEFA, and glycerol concentrations as described above. VPC was determined by measuring VPC/VEGP by PINTA as described above using 300 \u03bcL of the collected media, and multiplying this ratio by the measured glucose production rate. In a subset of studies, cells were incubated for 8 hr during the glucose production assay in media containing one of the following agents (all dissolved in 0.5% DMSO), or 0.5% DMSO vehicle: 20 \u03bcM ET-18-OCH3 (Santa Cruz), 100 \u03bcM U-73122 (Sigma), 30 nM thapsigargin (Sigma), 100 nM vasopressin (Sigma) 50 \u03bcM 2-APB (R&D Systems), 70 \u03bcM caffeine (Sigma), 1 mM malic enzyme inhibitor hydroxymalonate (Sigma). To inhibit PKA, hepatocytes were incubated in H-89 dichloroacetate hydrate (Sigma, 25 \u03bcM) dissolved in media, or media lacking H-89 as a control. In the insulin treatment studies, hepatocytes were incubated in 1 nM insulin with 5% BSA and glucose production media for the duration of the glucose production assay. In the in vitro atglistatin study, hepatocytes were incubated in 10 \u03bcM atglistatin in 0.1% EtOH, or 0.1% EtOH vehicle. All values were normalized to total protein content determined from whole-cell lysates by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as fold change verses vehicle-treated cells.",
                                "To assess oxygen consumption, primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated as described above and plated on collagen-I coated XF24 V7 cell culture plates (1.2\u00d7104 cells per well) in 2 mL recovery media as previously described (Camporez, J. P. et al. Endocrinology 154, 3099-3109). Following incubation for 6 hr at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml Low Glucose Culture Media and incubated overnight in 250 \u03bcl low glucose culture media at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2. The following morning, cells were washed with XF24 assay media (DMEM Base containing 1.0 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4). 500 \u03bcL of XF24 Assay Media was added to each well and plates were equilibrated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. Four measurements of basal oxygen consumption rates (picomoles per minute) were recorded on a Seahorse Bioscience XFe 24 Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) using an instrument protocol of 3-minute mix, 2-minute wait, and 3-minute measure. After baseline measurements, glucagon (or vehicle) was injected at a final concentration of 100 nM and oxygen consumption was recorded using the same instrument protocol. Ten measurements were taken following injection and the average of eight measurements were used for subsequent analyses. Oxygen consumption rates were normalized to total protein content and expressed as fold change compared to vehicle-treated cells. Experiments were repeated three times using 3-4 mice per genotype.",

                                "**Selected Discussion**",
                                "In order to examine the potential calcium dependence of the acute hepatic gluconeogenic response to glucagon, overnight-fasted, glycogen-depleted, liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout (InsP3R-I KO) mice and their age and weight-matched, wild-type (WT) littermates were studied (FIG. 30A). InsP3R-I KO mice exhibited a marked reduction in hepatic InsP3R-I protein expression with undetectable InsP3R-II and unchanged InsP3R-III protein expression (FIGS. 30B-30D). The mice were treated with an acute infusion of glucagon, which raised plasma glucagon concentrations approximately five-fold and led to a modest increase in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in WT but not in liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice (FIGS. 24A-24C). Concentrations of cAMP, activity of protein kinase A (PKA), and phosphorylation of CRTC2 were increased with glucagon in both genotypes, dissociating activity of each of these mediators from glucagon-induced changes in plasma glucose/insulin concentrations. However, glucagon infusion activated InsP3R-I by increasing its phosphorylation two-fold only in WT livers (FIGS. 24D-24E and 30E-30F). Glucagon stimulated hepatic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK) isoform II but not CAMKIV phosphorylation in an InsP3R-I-dependent manner (FIGS. 24F and 30G). Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, these data suggest that InsP3R-I activation and resultant CAMKII activity are required for glucagon's acute effect to stimulate hepatic glucose production (HGP), which can be attributed almost entirely to gluconeogenesis in this hepatic glycogen-depleted state. To determine the mechanism by which glucagon acutely stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through InsP3R-I activity, PINTA method was applied to quantify rates of hepatic glucose production and pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC). Using this approach \u02dc25% increases in rates of HGP were measured. Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, this could be attributed to increased hepatic VPC flux associated with plasma and liver amino acid depletion without any alterations in hepatic glycogen content (FIGS. 24G-24H and 30H-30O, Tables 11-12). These reductions in amino acid concentrations were largely accounted for by reductions in alanine content, while glutamine/glutamate concentrations were not significantly altered by glucagon. The observed increase in the rate of in vivo HGP was mirrored by a two-fold increase in both glucose production and VPC flux in isolated hepatocytes from WT but not from InsP3R-I KO hepatocytes incubated with glucagon (FIGS. 30P-30Q). The ability of insulin to suppress both glucose production and VPC flux was unaltered in InsP3R-I KO mice (FIGS. 30R-30S). Malic enzyme activity was also dissociated from glucose production: incubation of hepatocytes with a small molecule inhibitor of malic enzyme activity had no impact on basal or glucagon-stimulated glucose production or VPC (FIGS. 30T-30U).",
                                "To further explore the mechanism by which glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose production and VPC flux and to examine the role of intrahepatic calcium signaling in these processes, isolated hepatocytes were treated with ET-18-OCH3 or U-73122, two phospholipase C (PLC) antagonists. Both agents inhibited glucose production and VPC flux in WT but not InsP3R-I KO hepatocytes, confirming that intact PLC signaling was required for glucagon to stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis via InsP3 receptor activation (FIGS. 25A-25B and 31A-31B). Similarly an inhibitor of PKA activity, H-89, abrogated glucagon's ability to stimulate glucose production and VPC only in WT hepatocytes, demonstrating that both the PLC and PKA pathways are required to activate gluconeogenesis in response to glucagon via InsP3R-I signaling (FIGS. 25C-25D). Next to more specifically confirm the role of InsP3R-I in mediating glucagon's in vitro effect to promote hepatic glucose production, hepatocytes were treated with vasopressin, an activator of the InsP3 receptor. Vasopressin recapitulated the effect of glucagon to drive both glucose production and VPC. Conversely two InsP3 antagonists, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-ABP) and caffeine, inhibited glucagon-stimulated glucose production and VPC flux (FIGS. 25E-25H and 31C-31D). In addition incubation of hepatocytes in KN-93, a small molecule inhibitor of CAMKII/IV activity, abrogated glucagon's effect to stimulate gluconeogenesis in WT hepatocytes, consistent with a critical role for InsP3R-I activation of CAMKII/IV in glucagon stimulation of gluconeogenesis (FIGS. 25I-25J). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the SERCA pump in both the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum, also inhibited both glucose production and VPC stimulated by glucagon (FIGS. 31E-31F), suggesting that maintaining a normal balance of calcium throughout the cell is required for normal InsP3R-I signaling. None of these agents had any effect in InsP3R-I KO mice, indicating that InsP3R-II and -III do not compensate for the absence of InsP3R-I in liver (FIGS. 25A-25J and 31A-31F).",
                                "The observed increases in rates of hepatic glucose production occurred in the absence of any effect of glucagon to acutely increase hepatic gluconeogenic mRNA or protein expression in vivo or gluconeogenic protein expression in hepatocytes but were associated with 35-60% increases in hepatic long-chain acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA content (FIGS. 24I-24J and 31G-31K). These increases in hepatic long-chain- and acetyl-CoA concentrations were dissociated from phosphorylation of both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), both of which were increased in InsP3R-I KO mice but not in WT mice (FIGS. 31L-31M). Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, this likely reflects the interplay between glucagon's ability to promote the phosphorylation of both enzymes and the ability of hyperinusulinemia, which was observed only in WT mice infused with glucagon, to suppress it. Hepatic long-chain acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA content increased in WT mice infused with glucagon despite reduced plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in glucagon-treated WT mice (FIG. 31N), consistent with glucagon stimulation of intrahepatic but not white adipocyte tissue (WAT) lipolysis. As acetyl-CoA is a key allosteric activator of PC, the increase in hepatic acetyl-CoA content observed with glucagon infusion could explain the increases in VPC and HGP rates that occurred following glucagon treatment in WT mice. These changes occurred independently of any changes in hepatic malonyl-CoA content (FIG. 31O), indicating that malonyl-CoA suppression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) was not responsible for glucagon stimulation of hepatic mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation under these conditions. The measured malonyl-CoA concentrations in these overnight fasted mice were 80% lower than those measured in fed mice (WT 3.30\u00b10.24 nmol g\u22121, p<0.0001 vs. overnight fasted mice; KO 3.16\u00b10.35 nmol g\u22121, p=0.0001 vs. overnight fasted mice).",
                                "To further understand the physiologic function of glucagon-induced endogenous glucose production, we fasted WT and InsP3R-I KO mice for 48 hr. In the starved state, despite 70-90% increases in plasma glucagon concentrations in the tail vein and portal vein, InsP3R-I KO mice manifested relative reductions in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations associated with reductions in hepatic long-chain CoA and acetyl-CoA content without any changes in hepatic malonyl-CoA content (FIGS. 31P-31U). These data demonstrate that the hepatic gluconeogenic response to glucagon is of minimal importance in maintaining plasma glucose during a relatively short-term (overnight) fast, but becomes critical to maintain euglycemia in the starved state.",
                                "Hepatic adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) S406 phosphorylation, which has previously been shown to regulate ATGL activity, was increased three-fold by glucagon in vivo in WT but not InsP3R-I KO mice (FIG. 26A). In contrast, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation was increased by glucagon in both genotypes, likely resulting from PKA activation but dissociating HSL activity from glucagon activation of glucose production and VPC (FIG. 32A). In vitro studies revealed 60-100% increases in NEFA and glycerol production with glucagon treatment in WT but not InsP3R-I deficient hepatocytes, demonstrating glucagon stimulation of intrahepatic lipolysis (FIGS. 32B-32C). Confirming the critical role of glucagon-stimulated intrahepatic lipolysis to promote gluconeogenesis, glucagon had no effect to stimulate either glucose production or VPC in hepatocytes treated with atglistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of ATGL (FIGS. 26B and 32D-32E). Incubating hepatocytes with the InsP3R agonist vasopressin recapitulated the effect of glucagon to stimulate intrahepatic lipolysis, whereas InsP3R antagonists (2-APB and caffeine) or a CAMKII/IV inhibitor (KN-93) abrogated the effect of glucagon to stimulate intrahepatic lipolysis, thereby confirming that InsP3R-mediated calcium signaling was required for glucagon stimulation of not only glucose production and VPC flux, but also intrahepatic lipolysis. Treatment with phospholipase C inhibitors (ET-18-OCH3 and U-73122), a PKA inhibitor (H-89), or with a SERCA pump inhibitor (thapsigargin) also abrogated glucagon's effect to stimulate intrahepatic lipolysis, demonstrating that with each agent tested, intrahepatic lipolysis was correlated with both VPC flux and glucose production in isolated hepatocytes (FIGS. 32F-32M).",
                                "To examine the potential role of glucagon stimulation of intrahepatic lipolysis in vivo, ATGL was knocked down in a liver-specific manner in weight-matched WT and liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout littermates (FIGS. 33A-33C). Liver-specific ATGL knockdown abrogated the effects of glucagon to stimulate HGP, VPC flux, and long-chain- and acetyl-CoA content in WT mice (FIG. 26C-26H), demonstrating a critical role for stimulation of intrahepatic lipolysis in mediating the increases in each parameter resulting from glucagon infusion. However, ATGL knockdown had no effect on these parameters in liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice, indicating that glucagon acts in a calcium-dependent manner to stimulate intrahepatic lipolysis, increase hepatic acetyl-CoA content, increase VPC and hepatic glucose production. These alterations in hepatic gluconeogenesis were again dissociated from changes in hepatic glycogen content or hepatic gluconeogenic protein expression, with gluconeogenic protein expression if anything highest in liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice with hepatic ATGL knockdown, a group in which glucagon failed to stimulate HGP or VPC. In addition, the alterations in hepatic gluconeogenesis rates were dissociated from WAT lipolysis, with plasma NEFA and glycerol concentrations suppressed in WT control mice following glucagon treatment, which could be attributed to compensatory hyperinsulinemia (FIGS. 33B-33I). Malonyl-CoA was relatively low in all groups (FIG. 33J), again inconsistent with glucagon regulation of \u03b2-oxidation by modulation of hepatic malonyl-CoA content under these conditions. Taken together these data identify a novel mechanism by which glucagon stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by promoting intrahepatic lipolysis through stimulation of ATGL in a InsP3R-I/Ca2+/calcium-dependent manner, thereby increasing hepatic acetyl-CoA content and hepatic gluconeogenesis from allosteric stimulation of pyruvate carboxylase activity.",
                                "Glucagon promoted increases in both mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium signaling in isolated hepatocytes from female WT but not liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice (FIGS. 27A-27D). The InsP3R agonist vasopressin caused an almost identical increase in both cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium signaling in WT but not InsP3R-I KO mice, consistent with glucagon stimulating InsP3-mediated calcium signaling (FIGS. 27E-27F and 34A-34B). Incubation of WT hepatocytes in the PKA inhibitor H-89 abrogated the calcium response to glucagon (FIGS. 34C-34F), indicating, consistent with the glucose production/lipolysis data (FIGS. 25C-25D and 32H), that intact PKA function and resultant calcium signaling is required for glucagon's effects on the liver. Ex vivo PINTA analysis also revealed that glucagon treatment stimulated hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) in vivo, increasing hepatic mitochondrial oxidation five-fold in WT mice, which could mostly be attributed to increased mitochondrial fat oxidation (FIGS. 27G-27H). However, liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice failed to exhibit any increases in hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in response to glucagon treatment in vivo. Taken together these data suggest that glucagon stimulates hepatic mitochondrial oxidation through activation of InsP3R-I resulting in increased intra-mitochondrial calcium, which in turn stimulates mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Consistent with this hypothesis, a 7-fold increase in hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase flux (VPDH) was observed in WT but not InsP3R-I KO mice infused with glucagon, without any difference in pyruvate kinase flux (VPK), with VPK representing a relatively small percentage (15-35%) of hepatic VPC flux (FIGS. 34G-34H) and consistent with relatively low hepatic pyruvate kinase flux under fasting conditions. In vitro studies confirmed an increase in oxygen consumption with glucagon stimulation in isolated hepatocytes from WT but not liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice (FIG. 34I) demonstrating that glucagon mediates these effects in a cell autonomous manner and providing additional cross-validation for the PINTA approach to assess rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in response to glucagon treatment in vivo. These data were replicated in hepatocytes from male mice, in which glucagon stimulated mitochondrial oxidation by \u02dc60% in WT hepatocytes (p<0.0001 vs. WT hepatocytes without glucagon), but this effect was blunted (p<0.0001) in InsP3R-I KO hepatocytes.",
                                "Surprisingly, liver triglyceride concentrations did not differ between chow fed WT and liver-specific InsP3R-I KO mice (FIG. 34J), suggesting that physiologic glucagon concentrations may not promote sufficient mitochondrial fat oxidation in ad lib fed mice to alter hepatic triglyceride content. However, it was found that chronic increases in hepatic mitochondrial oxidation induced by chronic glucagon treatment would reverse NAFLD and improve whole body insulin sensitivity. Chronic glucagon infusion studies performed in awake high fat fed (HFD) rats with diet-induced obesity, and found that after ten days of treatment, chronic glucagon infusion caused a two-fold increase in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation, which could entirely be attributed to increased rates of hepatic fat oxidation, with VPC/VEGP and VPC/VCS ratios identical between PINTA and ex vivo NMR analysis (FIGS. 28A-28C and 35A-35D). Consistent with the findings in the acute glucagon infusion studies, hepatic VPK flux did not change with chronic glucagon treatment, remaining a small proportion (\u02dc15-20%) of hepatic VPC flux (FIG. 35E). Two hours after withdrawal of the glucagon infusion, rats treated with glucagon exhibited 1.4 mM reductions in fasting plasma glucose and 50% reductions in fasting plasma insulin concentrations which were associated with 50-90% reductions in hepatic triglyceride and diacylglycerol concentrations and marked reductions in protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC\u03b5) translocation despite similar food intake, body weight, and hepatic ceramide content (FIGS. 28D-28H and 35F-35G, Tables 13-14). Consistent with chronic increases in hepatic glycogenolysis and/or reductions in glycogen synthesis due to lower plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, chronic glucagon infusion also resulted in reductions in liver glycogen content (FIG. 35H). In contrast to acute glucagon infusion, chronic glucagon infusion with withdrawal of glucagon treatment four hours before sacrifice resulted in suppression of both hepatic acetyl- and malonyl-CoA content (FIGS. 35I-35J). Consistent with the lower hepatic diacylglycerol/PKC\u03b5 translocation and hepatic acetyl-CoA content and their respective roles to inhibit insulin receptor kinase activity and pyruvate carboxylase activity, HFD rats chronically infused with glucagon manifested improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as reflected by 20 and 60% reductions in glucose and insulin area under the curve, respectively, during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (FIGS. 281-28J and 35K-35L).",
                                "Finally, to determine whether InsP3R-I-dependent calcium signaling mediates the chronic effect of hyperglucagonemia to increase hepatic fat oxidation, reverse NAFLD, and improve glucose tolerance, a four-week continuous infusion of glucagon was performed in diet-induced obese WT and InsP3R-I KO mice. Despite unchanged body weight, food and water intake, activity and energy expenditure, WT mice treated with glucagon exhibited 50-80% reductions in liver triglyceride and diacylglycerol content and PKC\u03b5 translocation, resulting in a marked improvement in glucose tolerance, without any alterations in hepatic ceramide concentrations (FIGS. 29A-29F and 36A-36I). However, InsP3R-I KO mice did not manifest any alterations in hepatic lipid content or glucose tolerance, demonstrating that the beneficial effect of glucagon to reverse NAFLD occurs through InsP3R-I-mediated calcium signaling.",
                                "Collectively, these studies reveal that glucagon stimulates intrahepatic lipolysis through an InsP3R-I/CAMKII-dependent process, leading to increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content, which allosterically activates PC activity and VPC flux, and that this phenomenon explains its acute, transcription-independent effect to acutely stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo. In addition, using PINTA analysis, it was found that glucagon stimulates hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (Vcs) through InsP3R-I-mediated calcium signaling, and that this process can be exploited by short-term continuous glucagon treatment leading to two-fold increases in hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation (VFAO), which resulted in large reductions in hepatic steatosis and marked improvements in glucose tolerance through reversal of hepatic insulin resistance. Glucagon's effect on the liver required activity of both PKA and PLC, but activation of either PKA or PLC alone was not sufficient to increase hepatic gluconeogenesis or mitochondrial oxidation in the absence of InsP3R-I-mediated calcium signaling. Thus these data provide a transcription-independent alternative mechanism that complements previous studies suggesting a PKA/CRTC2/transcription-dependent mechanism (Wang, et al., Nature 485, 128-132, 2012) as well as a CD38/cADPR/transcription-dependent mechanism of action for glucagon(Rah, & Kim, Sci Rep 5, 10741, 2015).",
                                "In summary, this study reveals several new aspects of glucagon biology and new mechanistic insights as to how glucagon stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in vivo. Specifically, these results show (FIG. 37):",
                                "1) Physiological increases in plasma glucagon concentrations acutely stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo through stimulation of intrahepatic lipolysis resulting in allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC) and that this occurs independently of glucagon-mediated transcriptional/translational increases in hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme protein expression.",
                                "2) Glucagon stimulation of intrahepatic lipolysis and hepatic VPC flux is mediated through increased ATGL S406 phosphorylation and activity, in that hepatic knockdown of ATGL abrogated glucagon's effect to acutely increase hepatic acetyl-CoA content and stimulate hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux and hepatic gluconeogenesis.",
                                "3) Physiological increases in plasma glucagon concentrations acutely stimulate rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in vivo, which can mostly be attributed to increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation.",
                                "4) Glucagon stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, intrahepatic lipolysis and mitochondrial oxidation are all dependent on intrahepatic calcium signaling mediated by InsP3R-I as reflected by the abrogation of these effects in liver-specific InsP3R-I knockout mice.",
