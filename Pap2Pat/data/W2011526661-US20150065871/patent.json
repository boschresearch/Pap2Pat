                        "In certain techniques for targeted blood-brain barrier opening, including using focused ultrasound (FUS), it can be desirable to increase targeting accuracy while decreasing the time and effort necessary for accurate targeting. Systems and techniques for blood-brain barrier opening using FUS are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0005711, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
                        "Targeting accuracy can be reduced by aberrations of the ultrasound beam caused by the skull. The discrepancy between the high speed of sound through the skull and the low speed through the underlying brain tissue, alone or along with attenuation of ultrasound waves through the skull bone, can distort the beam shape, including at higher frequencies. Moreover, the trabecular layer of the skull can induce heterogeneities in both speed of sound and density, which can lead to phase aberrations of the acoustic beam. At higher frequencies, the defocusing effect of the skull can be increased as the wavelength can reach the size of local skull bone heterogeneities (for example, the trabeculae can be around 1 mm). The phase aberrations can be reduced by reducing the ultrasound frequency. However, the size of the focal region can likewise increase, which can increase the likelihood of undesirable inertial cavitation.",
                        "In therapeutic ultrasound, it can also be desirable to have real-time monitoring and treatment efficiency verification. A passive cavitation detector (\u201cPCD\u201d) can be used to transcranially acquire the acoustic emissions stemming from the microbubble. The frequency analysis of backscattered signals can be relevant to characterize undesirable bubble-capillary interaction."

                        "According to aspects of the disclosed subject matter, systems and techniques for real-time, transcranial monitoring of safe blood-brain barrier opening include an ultrasound transducer and a targeting component configured to target the ultrasound transducer for targeted blood-brain barrier opening by targeting a predetermined region in a brain of a patient from a predetermined approach angle.",
                        "With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary system 100 for real-time, transcranial monitoring of safe blood-brain barrier opening is illustrated. A subject 102 can be positioned in a stereotaxic frame under general anesthesia. For example and not limitation, a 500-kHz ultrasound transducer 104 can be attached to a Kopf stereotaxic manipulator 114 to enable targeting of the ultrasound focus in stereotactic coordinates, as described herein. Negative control sonications can be performed in the absence of microbubbles, as illustrated in FIG. 2 and discussed further herein. For example and not limitation, monodisperse 4-5 11 m microbubbles can be IV injected and size-isolated using differential centrifugation. The subject 102 can be sonicated for about 2 minutes with focal maximum pressures ranging between about 0.20 and about 0.30 MPa. Post-sonication controls in the presence of microbubbles can be performed, and the location of the BBB opening can be determined, for example using contrast-enhanced T1 images, as discussed herein.",
                        "With continued reference to FIG. 1, the attenuation in the subject 102 scalp can be considered around \u22120.9 dB/em and the thickness can be about 0.5 em. Attenuation in the subject 102 brain tissue can be determined to be about \u22120.5 dB/em and the thickness can be about to 2 em. As such, the emission amplitude can be raised by 7.15 dB (approximately a factor 2.28) compared to the calibration measurements in water to compensate for the energy loss along the path. For example and without limitation, a Hatband, spherically focused hydrophone 106 (Y-107, Sonic Concepts, W A, USA) can be positioned through the center hole of the FUS transducer 102. The two transducers 104, 106 can be aligned so that their focal regions overlapped within the confocal volume. The hydrophone 106, which can be connected for example and without limitation to a digitizer 108 (Gage Applied Technologies, Inc., Lachine, QC, Canada) through a 20-dB amplification 110 (5800, Olympus NDT, Waltham, Mass., USA), can monitor real-time acoustic emissions from microbubbles (referred to herein as passive cavitation detection or PCD).",
                        "Still referring to FIG. 1, the top image illustrates a large view of the operating room. As embodied herein, the PC and amplifiers can be used to drive the transducer-hydrophone assembly. The degassing system 112 (vacuum pump+water circulation pump) can provide a constant flow of degassed water for acoustic coupling. As embodied herein, the transducer-hydrophone assembly can be mounted on a manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom (x, y, and z position of the focus, as well as two approach angles: azimuth and elevation). The bottom image illustrates an enlarged view. The membrane 116 can be inflated to regulate the water flow using the degassing system 112, which can provide a maximal acoustic transmission in the subject 102.",
                        "Individualized targeting of the ultrasound focus to a particular brain region can be performed. The targeting can include T1 weighted stereotactically aligned structural images acquired for all animals (Tt sequence as discussed further herein). For targeting in stereotactic coordinate frames, an R-based (R Development Core Team 2009) software package (stereotax.R) can be utilized to convert a particular setting of the stereotactic manipulator (Kopf) into stereotactic coordinates. The setting of the stereotactic manipulator can be determined by one or more of the following free parameters: the setting of the media-lateral drive (ml), the position of the manipulator on the stereotactic arm along the anterior-posterior direction (ap), the setting of the dorso-ventral drive (dv), the rotation of the manipulator around the z-axis (azimuth), the tilt of the manipulator (elevation angle) that can occur either around the ml- or ap-axis (elevation setting), the position of the manipulator on the left or right stereotactic arm (arm), the relative alignment of the ml and dv stereotax drives, i.e., the ml drive positioned anterior or posterior to the dv drive (stereo), and a degree of freedom that determined the attachment of the ultrasound transducer on the stereotactic manipulator (finger). Based at least in part on the setting of the stereotactic manipulator, the software can determine the focal point and the axis from the focal point to the ultrasound transducer (angle of approach). For visualization purposes, the predicted region of BBB opening around the ultrasound focus can then be projected onto an individual stereotactically aligned T1 image, as illustrated for example in FIG. 2. The software can also invert this procedure, that is, for any desired sonication target (including a desired approach angle) that can be specified in stereotactic coordinates, the software can determine up to eight different settings of the stereotactic manipulator to target this neural structure from the specified approach angle, and an optimal approach angle can then be determined. As embodied herein, the approach angle can be set to provide a close to perpendicular incidence angle between ultrasound beam and skull.",
                        "The BBB opening can be verified, for example and as embodied herein, with contrast-enhanced MRI. T2 and T2 FLAIR images can be taken of the subject 102 to detect any potential damage caused by the sonication. The integrity of the BBB can be tested using a T1 contrast agent gadodiamide (Omniscan\u2122) that can be used to visualize the break-down of the BBB in neurological disease. A high-resolution structural T1 image can be recorded prior to the injection of gadodimide (T1 Pre; 3D Spoiled Gradient-Echo, TRITE=20/1.4 ms; flip angle: 30\u00b0; NEX=2; in-plane resolution: 1\u00d71 mm2; slice thickness: 1 mm with no interslice gap). 30 min after injection of 0.15 ml/kg gadodiamide IV, another T1 image can be acquired using similar scanning parameters (T1 Post). As gadodiamide typically not cross the intact BBB, increased T1 signal strength can be found in vessels or regions with increased BBB permeability. As embodied herein, a 3D T2-weighted sequence (TRITE=3000/80 ms; flip angle: 90\u00b0; NEX=3; spatial resolution: 400\u00d7400 mm2; slice thickness: 2 mm with no interslice gap) and a 3D Susceptibility-Weighted Image (SW) sequence can be applied (TRITE=19/27 ms; flip angle: 15\u00b0; NEX=1; spatial resolution: 400\u00d7400 mm2; slice thickness: 1 mm with no interslice gap).",
                        "T1 pre and T1 post images can be registered to the individual stereotactically aligned T1 image using FSL's FLIRT routine. To estimate gadodiamide concentration [Gd]c, the post T1 image can be divided by the pre T1 image to obtain a post/pre image. The post/pre image can highlight regions of increased T1 contrast following the injection of gadodiamide. This can include regions of interest where the BBB was opened, but also can include vessels or other regions with high blood volume such as the pial surface. The post/pre image can be flipped such that the left hemisphere overlaid the right hemisphere. The un-flipped image can be divided by the flipped image. This procedure can reduce or remove activations due to high [Gd]c in voxels with high blood-volume, in symmetric regions between the hemispheres. The resulting image can highlight increased [Gd]c in the sonicated region, as well as some residual artificial activation, which can be due to asymmetric vasculature.",
                        "To assess the targeting accuracy, the resulting image can be rotated and shifted into a new coordinate frame, where the origin can be defined as the predicted location of the ultrasound focus, and the z-axis can correspond to the approach angle, as shown for example in FIG. 3. FIGS. 3A-3D form a series of illustrations showing a quantification of targeting accuracy. After calculating the raw result image that provides a normalized estimate of the increase in T1 contrast (as shown in FIG. 3A), the image was shifted and rotated in to a new coordinate frame (as shown in FIG. 3B) whose origin was defined by the coordinates of the intended target, and the z-axis corresponded to the approach angle. A voxel was considered opened if its T1 value was enhanced by about 10%. The in-plane targeting accuracy was assessed by averaging the fraction of opened voxels across the z-axis (as shown in FIG. 3C). Targeting in the depth axis along the ultrasound beam was quantified by collapsing across the x and y-axis (as shown in FIG. 3D).",
                        "A region of interest around the origin was selected corresponding to \u00b17.5 mm in the x- and y-direction, and \u22125 to +12 mm along the z-axis. A voxel can be considered \u201copened\u201d when the T1-enhancement exceeds a threshold of 10%. The total volume of the BBB opening can be quantified as the volume of the opened voxels in the region of interest around the sonication target. The fraction of opened voxels can be averaged across the z-axis. The region of the opening can be defined on the two-dimensional x-y map as pixels with more than an average of 35% of opened voxels (black contour line). The observed center of the sonication in the x-y-plane can be defined as the center of mass of the region of the opening (illustrated as a black dot in FIGS. 4-6). The targeting error in the x-y plane can be defined as the difference of the observed position of the opening from the theoretical position of the geometric focus. Similarly, targeting accuracy along the axis of propagation of the ultrasound can be assessed by averaging the fraction of opened voxels across the x- and y-axis. The averaging can be performed on voxels within a square region of \u00b12 mm around the observed xy-center of the sonication. The center of the sonication along the z-axis can be defined as the center of gravity of the bins with more than 35% opened voxels. The targeting error along the z-axis can be defined as the difference between the observed center of the sonication along the z-axis and the predicted focal depth. The predicted focal depth can be determined to be the geometric focal depth plus 5 mm due to the focal shift induced by the skull.",
                        "FIG. 4 forms a series of plots illustrating targeting accuracy for 6 (4+2 for two monkeys 0 and N) sonications of caudate nucleus. The panels in the first row show the color-coded fraction of activated voxels (>10% enhancement of T1 signal) as a function of medio-lateral and anteroposterior deviation from the intended focal point in the x-y-plane. The panels collapsed across voxels that are between \u22125 mm and 10 mm in depth from the intended depth. In all instances, the opening of the BBB either overlapped with or was in immediate vicinity of the intended target. To quantify targeting accuracy along the direction of the ultrasound propagation, panels in the second row show the fraction of activated voxels collapsed around a 2 mm by 2 mm square region around the measured focal point (block dots in panels in A). The dotted horizontal line corresponds to the depth of the geometric ultrasound focus. The actual focal depth (solid horizontal line) shifted about 5 mm towards the ultrasound transducer. Panels in the third row depict the backscattered acoustic energy of the microbubbles excited in the ultrasound focus as a function of time from injection of the microbubbles. The blue line to the desired harmonic oscillations of the microbubbles (HEY) associated with safe BBB opening. The black line corresponds to inertial cavitation (BE1) that has been linked to extravasation of red blood cells and tissue damage. The red line corresponds to the BE1 detection threshold.",

                        "FIG. 6 forms a series of plots illustration targeting accuracy and PCD responses for 5 sonications of putamen in the second animal.",
                        "As embodied herein, real-time monitoring can be performed using the evolution of the frequency content of the backscattered acoustic signal. Bubble oscillations along the acoustic excitation can be non-linear (stable cavitation), and the PCD can thus detect harmonic modes in the frequency spectrum. Bubble collapse and jet, more generally described herein as inertial cavitation, can induce broadband noise. As such, detection of broadband response can be considered a signature of inertial cavitation. Using 4-5-f, 1 m monodisperse microbubbles, the BBB can be opened without inertial cavitation. Additionally, stable cavitation alone has not been associated with any tissue damage. The frequency spectra of backscattered acoustic emissions can be used to infer the cavitation-behavior of the micro-bubbles in the focal region. To remove the harmonic (nf, n=1, 2, . . . , 6), sub-harmonic (f/2) and ultra-harmonic (nf/2, n=3, 5, 7, 9) frequencies produced by stable cavitation, the response within a 300-kHz bandwidth around each harmonic and 100-kHz bandwidth of each sub- and ultra-harmonic frequency can be filtered out in order to obtain the broadband signal. This can be performed within the 0.6-5.2 MHz frequency band to reduce or inhibit perturbation induced by the fundamental frequency and to account for the growing attenuation of the signal along the frequency. From the sets of two spectra, both the broadband and total energies (respectively \u03b5broadband and \u03b5total) can be determined by summing the spectral amplitudes (s) on the defined frequency range as follows:",

The positive controls can use pressures between 0.05 and 0.35 MPa. Except for the shorter duration and variable pressures, the same sonication settings can be applied for the treatment sonication. The positive controls can be used to describe the relationship between ultrasound pressure and the harmonic/broadband energy increase. As discussed further herein, for purpose of illustration and confirmation of the disclosed subject matter, 8 testing sets were performed. The mean HEI over the entire sonication can be calculated to relate stable cavitation to the observed size of the BBB opening."

Briefly, the animals were sonicated for two minutes using a 500 kHz focused ultrasound transducer following the systemic injection of microbubbles. The opening location was then analyzed using contrast-enhanced T1 images (as shown in FIG. 2D) for details. Additional clinical scans were performed to detect potential damage. FIG. 2C illustrates a geometric ultrasound focus overlaid on a T1 structural scan in stereotaxic coordinate frame. Due to the geometry of the ultrasound transducer, the focal region was elongated along the axis of ultrasound propagation. The ultrasound was applied at an angle of 26\u00b0 from the upper right to provide a close to normal incidence angle of the ultrasound and skull. FIG. 2D illustrates a T1 structural scan in stereotaxic coordinate grame and illustrates increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability for the T1 contrast agent gadodiamide following a single sonication of left caudate. Brighter colors indicate regions where gadodiamide was able to diffuse across the BBB into the brain tissue. The remaining regions of increased T1 signal indicate asymmetric vasculature. Note the close alignment between intended (as shown in FIG. 2 C) and actual location (as shown in FIG. 2D)) of the BBB opening.

The image on the right renders regions where the T1 contrast agent gadodiamide was able to diffuse to the brain parenchyma as a result of BBB opening (as described herein).

The individual plots for lateral and axial targeting accuracy are depicted in FIG. 4 for caudate targets of both animals. FIGS. 5 and 6 provide identical plots for the putamen sonications in the two animals, respectively. These results illustrate the reproducibility and targeting precision of the FUS technique. First, the targeting accuracy was quantified by averaging the relative focal position for all sonications and animals. The mean focal point was 0.2\u00b11.0 mm posterior to the intended target (all results are reported as mean\u00b1standard deviation in mm). This difference did not reach significance (t-test, p>0.05). The observed focal point was significantly ventral to the intended target (1.9\u00b11.7 mm; t-test p<0.05). Further, the mean focal point was shifted towards the ultrasound transducer (1.4\u00b11.4 mm, t-test, p<0.05). Predicted focal depth was defined as the depth of the geometric ultrasound focus plus 5 mm (i.e., shifted towards the ultrasound transducer). The 5 mm shift was added to account for the shift of focal depth that was measured in vitro with immersed skull plates. Hence, the results demonstrate the correspondence between the in vitro and in vivo measurements. However, a stronger focal shift was observed in the in vivo experiments.",

The mean targeting error over all sonications in the lateral plane was 2.5+1.2 mm. Mean targeting error in the axial direction was 1.5\u00b11.3 mm. Combined lateral and axial error averaged 3.1\u00b11.3 mm.",
                                "During experiments, and according to some embodiments, the system was further configured to dissociate random errors due to day-to-day fluctuations from systematic targeting errors that could be specific to a particular animal and/or target. To quantify the systematic targeting error the location of the focal point for both targets and both animals were averaged separately. The mean systematic lateral targeting error was 1.8 mm. Mean systematic axial targeting error was 1.4 mm. Combining the lateral and axial error resulted in a mean systematic targeting error of 2.7 mm across all four targets (2 targets in 2 animals). An analysis of variance was utilized to test whether targeting accuracy differs as a function of the four different groups of sonications (two targets in two animals). Neither anterior-posterior nor axial position (relative to the intended target) differed as a function of the sonication group. However, dorso-ventral position depended on sonication group (ANOV A, p<O.OS). This can be due at least in part to the difference between the two caudate and the two putamen targets. In both animals, the sonications to putamen exhibited a systematic targeting error in the along the dorso-ventral axis. No such systematic targeting error was found in the caudate sonications.",

The mean random lateral error was 1.2\u00b10.6 mm. The mean random axial error was 0.6\u00b10.6 mm. Combining lateral and axial error, a mean random error of 1.5\u00b10.7 mm was found.",
                                "The size of the region in which the permeability of the BBB was increased was quantified. Averaged over all sonications, the volume of the BBB opening was estimated at 115\u00b144 mm3. Larger openings were observed at higher sonication pressures (e.g., 0.30 MPa). Moderate openings were observed at lower pressures (0.20 or 0.25 MPa). One sonication at 0.25 MPa failed to elicit any opening (as shown in FIG. 5). Another sonication at 0.20 MPa only elicited a minimal opening (as shown in FIG. 4).",

The lower rows in FIGS. 5-7 render the recorded real-time monitoring for the corresponding sonications. In all but one of the sonications, HEI increased by at least 15 dB during the sonication. This was indicative of stable cavitation of the bubbles in the focal region. The lack of an increase in broadband energy indicated the absence of potentially harmful inertial cavitation. A 6 dB threshold, corresponding approximately to two times average of the negative controls, had been set as a limit of potential damage and was never surpassed.",
                                "To characterize the dynamic range of the HEI and BE1 responses, acoustic emissions as a function of ultrasound pressure were measured using a series of brief ultrasound pulses of a wide range of pressures (as described herein). FIG. 7 illustrates HEI and BE1 as a function of ultrasound pressure. As expected, the HEI starts increasing for lower pressures (0.15 MPa). In contrast, the BE1 remains unchanged at 0 dB for pressures up to 0.35 MPa. The HEI seems to reach an asymptote of approximately 10 dB for pressures at and above 0.25 MPa. It is lower than what is shown in the real-time PCD monitoring since this PCD testing was done after the treatment sonication and part of the circulating bubbles were degraded. This analysis defines a window between 0.15 and 0.35 MPa that leads to a reliable increase of harmonic energy while avoiding potentially harmful broad-band energy increase. In this study, pressures were well within this window and ranged between 0.20 and 0.30 MPa.",

Data was acquired using a series of brief pulses of ultrasound after the main sonication while micro-bubbles were still circulating. The blue dash line corresponds to the lowest pressure at which BBB opening was achieved, and the. The light blue area highlights the pressure range used in this study. The red line corresponds to the ultrasound pressure that would cause BE1 to rise above levels that were found to be safe in the current set of sonications.",

To that aim, size of the BBB opening as a function of the mean HEI during the 2-minute sonication period were plotted (e.g., FIG. 8B). The results showed that stronger HEI responses are not indicative of larger BBB opening volume. However, in all but two cases, the presence of HEI went along with a successful BBB opening.",

Two targets in the putamen and the caudate for two animal subjects (0 and N) were marked separately. FIG. 8A illustrates the relationship between ultrasound pressure and opening size (r=0.41). Due to the narrow range of pressures and low number of sonications, this effect does not reach significance. The dashed line shows the mean value with standard deviation. As shown in FIG. 8B, there is no apparent relationship between average HEI and opening volume.",

Coronal and sagittal slices of these experiments are illustrated in FIG. 10. Standard T1 contrast enhanced imaging and subsequent analyses indicate a clearly visible, average-sized (126 mm3) BBB opening. FIG. 11 illustrates the opening volume decreased with time. The BBB was almost completely restored two days after sonication. Experiments in mice have shown that the duration of the BBB opening depends on acoustic and microbubble parameters.",

                                "Some of the above discussed experiments were aimed at testing whether a single spherical transducer at an intermediate frequency of 500 kHz can be used for accurate, repeatable and localized blood-brain barrier disruption in deep subcortical structures. The observed targeting error was sufficiently small (as embodied herein, 2.5\u00b11.2 mm laterally, 1.5\u00b11.3 mm along depth-axis, 3.1\u00b11.3 total) to enable the specific targeting of substructures of the basal ganglia such as the associative or oculomotor caudate.",
                                "To further reduce the targeting error potential sources of the error were analyzed. Three potential factors for error include: errors due to deviation of the geometric focus from the intended target (geometric errors), errors due to the analysis of the focal position (analysis errors), and errors due to deviation of actual ultrasound focus from the geometric focus (ultrasound aberration errors).",
                                "Over the course of the experiments, the stereotactic manipulator and the targeting routine were repeatedly calibrated. For these calibrations, a metal rod was used that was attached to the stereotaxic manipulator in the same way as the ultrasound transducer. The length of the rod was chosen to match the focal length of the transducer and hence its tip corresponded to the location of geometric ultrasound focus (assuming there were no ultrasound aberrations). This setup enabled targeting of various known positions, such as the interaural point of the stereotax. These measurements routinely found deviations from the intended target about 1-2 mm. Geometric error arises when the setting on the stereotactic manipulator that determines geometric focus is off. The position of the geometric focus can be determined by the 9 degrees of freedom of the stereotactic manipulator. Some of these settings are continuous and prone to error. The ml, ap, and dv settings have 1 mm scales in combination with a vernier scale to enable accuracy on the order of a tenth of a millimeter. The azimuth and elevation scales, however, are divided in steps of 5 and 2 degrees, respectively, without an additional vernier scale. This can enable accuracy of about 1 to 2 degrees. Even small angular deviations can have a big effect on the final position of the geometric focus.",
                                "The elevation setting should be correct for an additional reason: If the approach angle deviates from vertical, gravitational forces perpendicular to the approach angle will grow stronger. These gravitational forces can introduce systematic errors for angled approach vectors. The mislocalization in the dorso-ventral direction was strongest for the putamen target, and this target utilized a more angled approach. The ventral mislocalization decreases over time (as shown for example in FIGS. 7 and 8). As such, over the time-course of the experiments described herein, more force was used to fasten the set-screws to maintain the elevation angle against gravitational pull.",
                                "Further, the analysis pipeline used to infer the observed focal point can induce additional small errors. The analysis depends on alignment of pre- and post-contrast-enhanced T1 images to a stereotactically aligned reference image. Small errors can arise during the registration process of the pre- and post-images to the reference. Similarly, the alignment of the reference image can fail to perfectly match the intended stereotactic alignment. In addition, the actual position of the animal in the stereotax can vary slightly on a day-by-day basis. Together these factors can contribute up to 1 mm of the random and/or systematic targeting error. Further, the fractional enhancement of the post-relative to the pre-image can be based on noisy T1 MRI images, which can contribute to the overall targeting error.",
                                "Mislocalization in the axial direction can occur due to ultrasound aberrations based on in vitro measurements with immersed skull plates. The results herein correspond to the in vitro findings. On average, a 6.5 mm focal shift was observed, compared to the predicted 5 mm focal shift. The additional 1.5 mm can be due at least in part to different ultrasound aberrations in vivo or can be due to geometric and analysis error.",
                                "Real-time monitoring based on the frequency content of the backscattered signal was performed to classify the cavitation behavior and hence establish the success and safety of the sonication. Measuring the cavitation spectrum can verify that the microbubbles are correctly excited in situ, i.e., non-linear resonance along the ultrasonic frequency without broadband noise signature of bubbles collapsing or micro-jet streaming (inertial cavitation). This can correspond to a significant HEI (between 15 dB and 25 dB) and no BET. During all experiments performed, (pressures at or below 0.3 MPa) only stable cavitation was observed. Therefore, the PCD monitoring indicated that the procedure can be considered safe and successful. In addition, the HEI can be indicator of the success of the BBB opening in these initial findings. For the cases with an average HEI higher than 5 dB, there was 94% (15/16) of success. The correlation between the HEI and the opening volume in FIG. 8B was not high since the focus was on a small range of pressures (0.20-0.30 MPa).",
                                "Focused ultrasound can be used to temporarily disrupt the integrity of the blood brain-barrier in specifically targeted brain regions of rodents and monkeys. Focused ultrasound can also allow clinicians to deliver drugs to specific neural targets. However, certain clinical ultrasound setups can include multiphased ultrasound transducer arrays located inside an MR scanner. This can restrict the use of ultrasound to highly specialized clinical settings. Here, a low-tech single-element 500 kHz spherical transducer ultrasound setup was used that can overcome this challenge. The system is portable, and can use a stereotactic targeting technique independent of MR guided targeting. The systems and techniques of the disclosed subject matter can thus use independent of an MR scanner. The stereotactic targeting procedure is accurate and reliable, and for purpose of illustration and confirmation, the success of the sonication can reliably be inferred using real-time passive cavitation spectral analysis. While successful sonications were usually accompanied by a 10-15 dB HEI, no correlation was found between HEI and opening volume.",
                                "As such, the systems and techniques according to the disclosed subject matter can be used to open the BBB in specific brain regions of a subject, largely independent of MRI-guided targeting and/or verification. Hence, in operation, the systems and techniques can provide noninvasive targeted brain-drug delivery to a subject in less specialized clinical settings (e.g., outpatient clinics; community hospitals). Targeting accuracy can be increased by using an individual stereotactically aligned T1 image. However, subsequent sonications can be performed completely independent of MRI.",
                                "The results and analyses outlined described herein illustrate that the single-element FUS systems and techniques can be used to accurately and reliably target sub-structures of the basal ganglia. Additionally, it can be desirable to know how long the BBB will stay open before it regenerates and prevents the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain. This can be desirable for at least the following two reasons: the window of opportunity during which drugs can be delivered can be determined and, how long the brain region in question will be exposed to other substances that usually would not cross the intact BBB can also be determined. The duration of the BBB opening can depend at least in part on the precise sonication parameters such as ultrasound pressure and microbubble size. The duration of the BBB opening can range between 12 hours and 5 days. First, the time course of the BBB closing for a single sonication in one of the macaque subjects was measured. Due to the closer similarity between brain structures of the macaque and human species, these measurements can correspond to a time course expected in the human brain. The results from a single exploratory analysis indicated that an average-sized BBB opening (\u02dc126 mm3) with moderate in situ ultrasound pressures (0.30 MPa) and 4-5 \u03bcm monodisperse microbubbles takes between 2 and 4 days to close."

By monitoring the SCDh, the time for microbubbles perfuse to the sonicated region as well as the microbubble persistence during the entire treatment can be monitored at pressures as low as 250 kPa. By monitoring the ICD, the safety of the treatment can be determined in real time at least in part because low or no inertial cavitation was detected in the cases of safe BBB opening. Low or no ICD obtained during BBB opening experiments (FIGS. 19A-19D) compared to the in vivo skull effect (FIG. 17A-17C) was due at least in part to lower number of microbubbles circulating during BBB opening, at least in part because increase of ICD was obtained in the same animal after a second bolus injection of microbubbles for in vivo skull effect.",
                                "Safe BBB opening was achieved at low pressures (250-600 kPa) in both the putamen and the thalamus (FIGS. 19A-19D). No differences were observed in the putamen and the thalamus in terms of cavitation doses or opening threshold, as described herein. The opening volume varied across animals, and increased with pressure in the same macaque comparing the 350-kPa example (FIG. 19B) with the 600-kPa example (FIG. 19D). The 450-kPa case had a smaller opening volume than the 350-kPa case from the slightly decreasing SCDh, which can be due at least in part to the animal's physiological effect to the circulating microbubbles. The average SCDh at different pressures was at the same level, which can be due at least in part to the cavitation characteristics using long pulses and the high variation between examples, as illustrated for example in FIGS. 16A-16C.",
                                "For purpose of illustration, as embodied herein, the positive correlation of the ICD to pressure can be considered independent of the pulse length, which can affect cavitation characteristics. The ICD in the examples herein was not affected by the nonlinear ultrasound scattering due to the skull (as illustrated for example in the human skull results in FIGS. 15D-15F. The ICD can also provides a safety assessment. Improved ICD detection can be achieved by increasing the cavitation SNR. Additionally or alternatively, passive cavitation mapping, including spatial information of cavitation, can improve estimation of opening volume and safety assessment using both the SCDh and ICD.",
