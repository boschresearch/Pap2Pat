    "abstract": "Data subsampling is widely used to speed up the training of large-scale recommendation systems. Most subsampling methods are model-based and often require a pre-trained pilot model to measure data importance via e.g. sample hardness. However, when the pilot model is misspecified, model-based subsampling methods deteriorate. Since model misspecification is persistent in real recommendation systems, we instead propose model-agnostic data subsampling methods by only exploring input data structure represented by graphs. Specifically, we study the topology of the user-item graph to estimate the importance of each user-item interaction (an edge in the user-item graph) via graph conductance, followed by a propagation step on the network to smooth out the estimated importance value. Since our proposed method is model-agnostic, we can marry the merits of both model-agnostic and model-based subsampling methods. Empirically, we show that combing the two consistently improves over any single method on the used datasets. Experimental results on KuaiRec and MIND datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior results compared to baseline approaches.",

                "Recommendation systems learn user preferences through user-item interactions such as user clicks. Usually, a user click is considered as a positive sample that indicates the user's interest in the clicked item while a no-click between a user-item pair is considered as a negative sample. A click-through rate (CTR) prediction model outputs click probabilities of user-item pairs, and such probabilities can be used to rank items upon a user's request. A CTR model is trained using data collected from online platforms, where user-item pairs with no-clicks dominate. The imbalance of the dataset [4] justifies negative sampling (NS), which down-samples negative samples and significantly reduces model training costs.",
                "In contrast to treating all data points as equally important, nonuniform subsampling aims to obtain more informative samples. Previous model-based methods [8,9,14,32,34,35,40] utilize a pilot model to assess the importance of data. When the pilot model is correctly pre-trained, one can achieve the optimal sampling rate: the method is measuring the importance of data using pilot prediction scores together with first and second-order derivatives of the loss function [35]. Since optimal negative sampling rates are proportional to the pilot model's prediction score, a high sampling rate indicates an inaccurate model prediction. Thus, one can interpret the sampling strategy as using hard negative samples (HNS) [8,40].",
                "We find that model-based sampling algorithms may not be applicable in real industrial scenarios. Figure 1 demonstrates how a real recommendation system deploys data subsampling. A user initiates a request to the online serving model and receives recommendations returned by the server. If the user clicks the recommended item, then a positive instance is collected. Otherwise, if the user does not click the item within a period of time, a negative instance is collected. Note that the pilot prediction score and other statistics are recorded in the instance to calculate the sampling rate. All instances are filtered by the data subsampling module before I/O to reduce the I/O and network bandwidth bottleneck. Offline models are trained with historical data before being deployed online.",
                "In these scenarios, there are two unavoidable obstacles to the application of model-based sampling. First, offline model training Figure 1: A simplified recommendation system. A user initiates a request to the online serving model and receives recommendations returned by the server. User clicks will trigger positive instances, while non-clicks will trigger negative instances. All instances are filtered by the data subsampling module. For model-based methods, subsampling rates are determined by online models (e.g. model v1), thus sub-optimal for offline training (e.g. model v2) purposes. When model v2 is deployed online, data subsampling is affected, producing inconsistent subsampling rates.",
                "is vulnerable to model misspecification, which leads to inferior results. Unfortunately, model misspecification is persistent due to online-offline discrepancy, especially in continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) [28] in real systems. Second, coupling data subsampling and model training introduces extra dependencies across system modules, which increases system maintenance cost and brings about extra technical debt [27].",
                "To maintain a scalable and sustainable data subsampling service, we propose model-agnostic data subsampling methods based on user-item bipartite graphs. In the bipartite graph, two sets of nodes represent users and items separately, and each edge represent interactions between a user and an item. Then we treat edges as instances to consider subsampling. In the context of a bipartite graph, we reinterpret the idea of HNS using effective conductance [7]. An edge is considered a hard instance if the effective conductance over its two nodes is high. With this notion of hardness, we assign high sampling rates to edges with high effective conductance. Additionally, we exploit the bipartite graph to propagate and refine the sampling rates. Since our proposed method is model-agnostic, we can marry the merits of both model-agnostic and model-based subsampling methods. Empirically, we show that combing the two consistently improves over any single method on the widely used datasets. To summarize our contribution:",

We advocate this model-agnostic sampling method due to the dilemma of unavoidable model misspecification in the online-offline discrepancy setup. a correctly specified pilot model is needed to derive a theoretically efficient data subsampling method. Under pilot model misspecifications, it is even non-trivial to guarantee model consistency (the subsampled estimator has the same limit as the full data estimator) for the log odds correction estimator (Eqn. 3) [9,14,29]. Therefore, pilot model misspecification is a realistic but underexplored problem in statistics."

We consider two baselines -the first baseline is the model-agnostic uniform negative sampling; the second is a model-based near-optimal sampling method (Opt-Sampling) [35], which relies on the prediction scores of a pilot model as the hardness score to calculate sample rates.  We study the scenario where data subsampling rates are pre-computed and do not change during model training. This scenario is aligned with industrial applications such as recommendation systems, where negative data are subsampled before saving in distributed storage to get rid of huge saving costs. Our method contrasts previous studies to re-compute and subsample data on the fly. For example, SRNS [8] quantifies sample hardness by estimating the variance of the model prediction along training epochs, which is dynamically updated each time model sees the sample. IRGAN [36] uses a GAN model where the generator draws negative samples from the negative pool and mixes them with positive samples. A discriminator classifies data and guides the generator to learn to sample hard negatives. These methods are not comparable to our work. To the best of our knowledge, Opt-Sampling [35] is the only representative method that allows for a fair comparison in the specific scenario considered by this work."

We observe that the maximum strategy consistently gives comparable or better results than Opt-Sampling and MA-EC. While in mean and product strategies, we do not observe significant improvement. For the product strategy, the model performance even deteriorates. MA-EC needs to compute effective conductance to calculate subsampling rates. Effective conductance computation is not our bottleneck since it can be reused once computed. MA-EC is model-agnostic, and thus can support training with different target models. Score correction. We investigate the effectiveness of correcting the hardness scores via graph propagation. We are interested in applying score correction in Opt-Sampling and MA-EC and their ensemble. Additionally, in applying both score correction and score ensemble, we can try either ensembling corrected scores or correcting ensemble scores. As we find the latter consistently results in worse performance, we only present the result of the former in this work. Figure 7(b) reports the model performance of our ablation study. For the experiments of correcting scores estimated from Opt-Sampling and MA-EC, we explore the propagation coefficient \ud835\udefe \u2208 {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}. For each coefficient, we iterate to smooth the scores until convergence. Uncertainty propagation significantly improves model performance for both subsampling approaches. In score propagation, which runs on scores corrected by uncertainty propagation, model performance slightly improves in Opt-Sampling and worsens in MA-EC. In the ensemble of corrected scores, we combine the hardness scores from the best configurations of both methods via maximum strategy. The reported result demonstrates that the ensemble strategy improves model performance over not only the original scores but also the corrected scores."

An edge with high effective resistance is considered important in maintaining graph topology. Since the definitions of edge importance using effective conductance and effective resistance run against each other, we demonstrate that defining edge importance with effective resistance is not applicable in our scenario. We compare two model-agnostic (MA) subsampling methods with effective resistance (MA-ER) and effective conductance (MA-EC) as the hardness scores. The effective resistance is computed on the graph where all edges have unit resistances. We demonstrate that MA-ER fails to capture hard negative instances. On the KuaiRec dataset, MA-ER yields an average test AUC of 0.8535, which is worse than uniform sampling (0.8553). To unravel how MA-ER and MA-EC affect model training, we randomly select a run from each method to visualize the model training metrics. In Figure 8, when using MA-ER, training AUC remains the same as testing AUC before convergence. Besides, the model converges earlier. In sharp contrast, in MA-EC, there is a huge gap between training AUC and testing AUC. The gap shows that training instances are overall harder than those in the test set. This verifies that MA-EC discovers hard negatives while MA-ER does not."
