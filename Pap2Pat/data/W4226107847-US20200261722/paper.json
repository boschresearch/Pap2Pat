    "title": "Effects of sub-threshold transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on cerebral blood flow",
    "date": "2021-12-15",
    "abstract": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise as a non-invasive alternative to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with implantable devices, which has been used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. Prior work has used functional MRI to investigate the brain response to taVNS, and more recent work has also demonstrated potential therapeutic effects of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS in rheumatoid arthritis. However, no studies to date have measured the effects of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS on cerebral blood flow (CBF). The objective of this study was to determine whether high-frequency (20 kHz) sub-threshold taVNS induces significant changes in CBF, a promising metric for the assessment of the sustained effects of taVNS. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans were performed on 20 healthy subjects in a single-blind placebo-controlled repeated measures experimental design. The ASL scans were performed before and after 15 min of either sub-threshold taVNS treatment or a sham control. taVNS induced significant changes in CBF in the superior posterior cerebellum that were largely localized to bilateral Crus I and Crus II. Post hoc analyses showed that the changes were driven by a treatment-related decrease in CBF. Fifteen minutes of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS can induce sustained CBF decreases in the bilateral posterior cerebellum in a cohort of healthy subjects. This study lays the foundation for future studies in clinical populations, and also supports the use of ASL measures of CBF for the assessment of the sustained effects of taVNS.",

                "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with implantable devices is currently used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. However the cost and complications associated with implantation have limited the application of invasive VNS to a broader range of health conditions1\u20134 and spurred growing interest in non-invasive approaches, such as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)4\u20137. In taVNS, an electrode on the surface of the ear delivers a small electrical current across the skin to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Stimulation of the auricular branch in turn activates other areas of the brain through connected pathways8,9, including regions involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The theory behind the therapeutic efficacy of taVNS is that stimulating the vagus nerve can correct maladaptive processing within the nervous system as well as neuro-immune communications that are associated with negative health outcomes. Building upon prior work that suggests a link between ANS dysfunction and inflammation10, a recent open-label study of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated clinically relevant changes in both disease biomarkers and symptoms after 12\u00a0weeks of sub-threshold taVNS treatment11. The therapeutic benefits of taVNS have also been reported in the context of depression5,10,12 and migraine13, with mounting evidence linking these clinical effects to neural responses4,6,14.",
                "While the mechanisms through which taVNS causes changes are not completely understood, a number of recent studies have used blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) to characterize the acute brain response to taVNS1,4,6,14\u201316. While BOLD fMRI is an effective approach for measuring evoked brain responses, its susceptibility to low-frequency noise sources makes it less effective for measuring changes that occur with time periods greater than several minutes17. In contrast, measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF), a well-defined physiological quantity, can be used to characterize changes in brain physiology occurring over periods ranging from seconds to years18, and therefore constitute a promising metric for the assessment of the sustained effects of VNS.",
                "In prior work, both SPECT and PET have been used to characterize the CBF response to VNS applied using implantable devices in patients with either major depression (MD) or epilepsy. In MD patients, SPECT has been used to demonstrate regionally dependent increases and decreases in CBF due to 4 to 10\u00a0weeks of chronic VNS19,20. In a PET study with MD patients, Conway et al.21,22 reported regionally dependent increases and decreases in the evoked CBF response to short duration (90\u00a0s) VNS. For epilepsy patients, Henry et al.23,24 reported PET-based CBF increases and decreases in the evoked CBF reponse to 30\u00a0s of VNS, with the effects diminishing after 12\u00a0weeks of chronic VNS. In addition, two earlier pilot studies25,26 reported VNS evoked changes in PET CBF measures.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the CBF response to taVNS. In this study, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to measure changes in CBF induced by 15\u00a0min of taVNS in healthy subjects, employing a high-frequency 20\u00a0kHz stimulus similar to that employed by Marsal et al.11. In contrast to SPECT and PET, ASL MRI does not require the injection of radioactive tracers, making it especially suitable for repeated measures in a healthy population27,28. Furthermore, in this study the taVNS is applied at a sub-threshold level, such that subjects cannot readily determine if they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. In contrast to prior studies where the perceptible sensations associated with VNS may have complicated the interpretation of the results, the sub-threshold stimulus used in this study removes somatosensory confounds and is therefore compatible with a single-blind placebo-controlled design. The goal of this study was to determine whether a single course of taVNS with duration similar to that of the daily dose employed in11 could lead to detectable changes in CBF."

Criteria for perceiving the stimulation include sensations of stinging, pricking, or warmth. This procedure was repeated until the subject reported feeling the stimulation at the same level three times. The sensation test was followed by a 15-min stimulation period. The stimulation was delivered continuously at 20\u00a0kHz, using biphasic square waves with pulse width of 20us. The stimulation amplitude was set at 75% of a subject\u2019s perceptual threshold (1.5\u20133.8\u00a0mA; impedance 3\u20139.5 k\u03a9 at 20\u00a0kHz) on the \"active\" stimulation day and was set to zero on the control day (\u201csham\u201d condition). The order of \u201cactive\u201d and \u201csham\u201d stimulation days was randomized across subjects. To verify that the subthreshold stimulation did not cause any local heating, we used a DTT-1372 Thermometer (Ames InstrumentsTM, Harbor Freight Tools USA. Inc., Calabasas, CA) to measure temperature changes over a 15-min period in both the active and sham conditions for one of the subjects. The probe was placed on the medial surface of the external ear, directly across from the earpiece that was positioned at the cymba concha on the lateral surface of the external ear. Minimal temperature increases were observed for active (0.20\u00a0\u00b0C) and sham (0.25\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions with no significant difference (p\u2009=\u20090.46) in the slope of the changes over the 15-min period.",

The SCORE algorithm31 was used on a per-slice basis to censor outlier timepoints in the CBF time series before computing the average CBF map.

For a specified voxelwise threshold, a permutation-based method (as implemented in AFNI 3dttest++\u2009with the -Clustsim option) was used to estimate the false positive rates associated with detecting clusters with varying cluster-size thresholds. Additional details and background on this approach are provided in Cox et al. 201733.

                "Our findings reveal a significant bilateral decrease in cerebellar CBF as a result of 15\u00a0min of sub-threshold taVNS, reflecting physiological changes that persisted for many minutes after the treatment. These effects were observed using a stimulus paradigm and duration similar to those of the daily dose employed in the recent open label clinical trial of11.",
                "In contrast to the current findings, prior studies have reported both unilateral26 and bilateral21,23,24 increases in cerebellar CBF. However, there are several key methodological differences that are worth noting. First and foremost, the prior studies examined evoked CBF changes in response to the concurrent application of 30 to 90\u00a0s of VNS, whereas the current study assessed resting-state CBF measures obtained before and after the application of taVNS. Thus, the prior findings are limited to characterizing the acute cerebellar CBF response to VNS, while the current findings offer evidence of a sustained decrease in cerebellar CBF in reponse to taVNS. Second, VNS consists of an implantable device targeting the cervical vagus nerve, while taVNS is non-invasive and applied to a branch originating from the superior ganglion of the vagus nerve. This difference in neural targets may be expected to produce different physiological responses. Third, the use of a sub-threshold high frequency (20\u00a0kHz) stimulus in the current study enabled the use of a single-blind placebo controlled design, in contrast to the open-label design with the super-threshold low frequency (20 to 30\u00a0Hz) stimuli employed in prior studies. The placebo control in the current study enabled a clean isolation of the direct vagal stimulation effects from those associated with stimulus-associated sensations and responses, a separation that was not possible with prior designs. In addition, there are likely to be frequency dependent neurophysiological mechanisms that lead to differences in the effects between the high (20\u00a0kHz) versus low (20 to 30\u00a0Hz) frequency stimulus paradigms. Finally, the current findings were obtained in healthy subjects who were na\u00efve to taVNS, whereas the prior results characterized the responses in MD or epilepsy patients at a time point that was hours to months after the commencement of continuous VNS therapy. Thus, the current study provides critical information about the effect of taVNS on the healthy brain that can serve as a baseline for the future assessment of effects in clinical populations.",
                "Stimulus-induced changes in cerebellar activity have also been observed with BOLD fMRI, but the experimental methods and results greatly vary across studies with reports of both evoked activations in healthy subjects1,15,16 and epileptic patients36 and deactivations in healthy subjects2 and MD subjects37,38. As the BOLD signal exhibits a complex dependence on neural, vascular, and metabolic factors, a definitive link between observed BOLD changes and underlying CBF changes cannot be established without additional experimental measures39. However for most conditions, task-evoked increases and decreases in the BOLD signal are generally thought to reflect concomitant CBF increases and decreases. Thus, while the fMRI findings cannot resolve whether VNS induces increases or decreases in cerebellar CBF, they offer general support for the potential of VNS to modulate CBF levels in the cerebellum.",
                "In this study, significant CBF changes were limited to the cerebellum. The prior PET and SPECT studies reported CBF changes in additional brain regions, although the results were highly variable across studies. As noted above, a number of these studies considered the evoked CBF response as compared to the sustained response reported here. Two SPECT studies examined the effects of 4 to 10\u00a0weeks of chronic VNS19,20 and reported increases and decreases in CBF in multiple brain regions, but there were differences between the two studies in the regions that were identified and neither study reported cerebellar CBF changes. In light of the variability observed in prior studies and the significant methodological differences discussed above, discrepancies between the prior and current findings are to be expected. In particular, the interpretation of the changes observed in the prior studies typically discussed the potential modulation of activity in regions that were thought to be associated with the disease state. These brain regions would not necessarily show an effect in healthy subjects. Nevertheless, a future study examining the effects of sub-threshold taVNS over a longer period (e.g. weeks) would be of interest to determine if CBF changes can be detected in areas beyond the cerebellum.",
                "While the cerebellum has traditionally been viewed as a motor control region, a wealth of evidence suggests that it also plays important roles in cognitive, affective, and social processing40\u201342. In particular, the cerebellar regions Crus I and Crus II, which exhibited the greatest overlap with significant CBF changes in this study, are considered to be primarily associated with non-motor functions, such as working memory, executive function, language processing, social mentalizing, and emotional cognition41,43,44. Interestingly, the cerebellum has a purported role in conditions for which taVNS has beneficial effects. For example, cerebellar dysfunction has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD)45, and a preliminary clinical study found that a multi-week regime of taVNS (relative to sham) can alleviate depression severity as assessed via the Hamilton Depression Scale in MDD patients5. TaVNS-induced cerebellar activation has also been reported in an fMRI study of MDD patients, though individual differences in activation were not related to clinical outcomes46. Furthermore, taVNS has shown promise as a treatment for migraine13, another disorder that has been linked to functional and structural alterations within the posterior cerebellum, namely Crus I and Crus II47,48. Finally, a recent study found that a 12-week regime of taVNS treatment (with parameters similar to those used in this study) improved symptoms for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)11. Reduced gray matter of the cerebellum has been associated with higher levels of peripheral inflammation in RA patients49. Together, these findings suggest that the link between taVNS therapeutic efficacy and cerebellar function should be further explored.",
                "There are limitations to the study that would be important to address in future follow-up work. First, the analysis required that all four ASL scans (Precontrol, Postcontrol, Pretreatment, and Posttreatment) were free from artifacts, as issues in any run could affect the main contrast. However, this strict approach makes the study sensitive to any issues like subject motion that can cause artifacts in the CBF maps, leading us to exclude five out of twenty-five subjects, even though a much lower fraction (10 out of 100) of the scans exhibited artifacts. For future work using ASL to probe taVNS effects, one improvement would be to use ASL sequences with higher SNR, such as 3D PCASL with background suppression to reduce motion sensitivity50,51. The increased SNR can be used to shorten the scan lengths while maintaining similar image quality, mitigating the risk of motion associated with longer scan times. The higher SNR also increases the ability to detect CBF changes in a group analysis, so that fewer subjects would be needed to detect the same effects, increasing the study robustness to subject exclusions. Second, there is a small possibility of a thermo-regulatory vascular confound in response to local energy deposition from taVNS. We believe this to be unlikely, as no subjects reported sensations of heating at the stimulation site. Furthermore, an in-situ thermal test of the device found minimal (<\u20090.3\u00a0\u00b0C) changes in temperature over a 15-min period in both active and sham conditions. However, we cannot completely rule out a vascular response that quickly dissipates heat and could prevent any detection of warmth despite an underlying change in neural response.",
                "In this study, the taVNS was applied at the cymba concha, which is 100% innervated by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve8. However, given the overlapping innervation by the greater auricular nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve of auricular regions proximal to the cymba concha8, it is not possible to completely rule out the effects on CBF through these pathways. For example, the auriculotemporal nerve lies within the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, and prior work indicates that stimulation of the trigeminal nerve can cause changes in CBF52.",
                "In conclusion, the present results indicate that 15\u00a0min of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS can induce sustained CBF decreases in the bilateral posterior cerebellum in a sample of healthy subjects. Further work is needed to determine if similar changes can be observed in clinical populations and to assess if the measures can provide greater insight into the mechanisms underlying treatment outcomes. In addition, future research should also address how stimulation parameters such as frequency, duration, and electrode location impact the response."
