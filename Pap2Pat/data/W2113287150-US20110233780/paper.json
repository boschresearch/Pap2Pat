    "abstract": "An interlayer of face centered cubic (fcc) Co4N has demonstrated significant improvements in adhesion between copper and diffusion barrier layers. This fcc phase of Co4N was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using bis(N-tert-butyl-N'-ethyl-propionamidinato)cobalt(II) and a reactant mixture of NH3 and H2 at substrate temperatures from 100 to 180\u00b0C. The Co/N atomic ratio and the phase of cobalt nitride film can be modified by adjusting the ratio of NH3 and H2 in the gas feedstock. The cobalt nitride films prepared by CVD are smooth, highly conformal, and stable against intermixing with copper up to at least 400\u00b0C. This fcc cobalt nitride material has very strong adhesion to copper due to the small lattice mismatch (\u22121 to 2%) between fcc-Co4N and fcc Cu. Copper wires should be stabilized against failure by electromigration when fcc cobalt nitride interlayers are placed between the copper and surrounding diffusion barriers.",

                "The chemical vapor deposition of Co x N was carried out in a hot wall, tube-furnace reactor. The schematic of the CVD system is as shown in Figure 1. The substrate holder is a half cylinder made of aluminum which was inserted into a stainless steel reactor tube. A cartridge heater and a thermocouple (not shown) are embedded in the substrate holder in order to heat the substrate to a temperature higher than the reactor wall by 10-20 \u2022 C. This arrangement favors deposition of desired film on the substrate rather than the wall and is suitable for a CVD process with a thermally activated rate. The reactor pressure during deposition was controlled automatically by a throttle valve (MKS Instruments) located downstream to the substrate holder. The metal precursors were loaded in U-shaped bubblers and ultra high purity N 2 was used as a carrier gas. The bubblers and their associated gas lines were plumbed inside ovens with suitable temperature set points for efficient vaporization and delivery of precursor vapors to the reactor tube. The gas flow rates were established using metalsealed mass flow controllers (MKS Instruments).",
                "CVD of Co x N was carried out from bis(N-tert-butyl-N -ethylpropionamidinato)cobalt(II), Co[Bu t NC(Et)NEt] 2 , precursor. The synthesis of Co[Bu t NC(Et)NEt] 2 has been described elsewhere. 21 This Co precursor is a dark green liquid at room temperature with melting point of -17 \u2022 C. The vapor pressure of this precursor may be approximated by log 10 (P, torr) = 5.424 -2151/T, giving 0.14 torr at 70 \u2022 C and 0.26 torr at 85 \u2022 C. Within this temperature range, the evaporation rate is about 0.1 nmol \u00d7 min -1 \u00d7 cm -2 of liquid surface, as measured by isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). No decomposition  was noted when bubblers were used in this temperature range over a period of several months. TGA with a linear temperature ramp of 10 K min -1 showed clean evaporation with no residue up to 200 \u2022 C, by which temperature the liquid had completely evaporated. 21 This result showed that no significant decomposition occurs within time periods of minutes even at temperatures as high as 200 \u2022 C. Another test of thermal stability was done by heating the neat liquid in contact with various surfaces: glass (presumably with little or no surface catalytic activity); oxidized stainless steel (to mimic a typical bubbler surface); and stainless steel from which the native oxide had been removed by acid etching. The viscosity of the precursor was also measured with flow tubes inside a glove box, in order to protect it from oxidation. Accelerated rate calorimetry (ARC) testing involves heating a closed sample at a series of increasing temperatures 10 K apart, with a dwell time of 50 minutes at each temperature. During this heating the pressure was measured to see if any gases are being generated by decomposition. If a significant pressure rise is detected, the dwell time is lengthened to see if the pressure rise is transient or if a self-sustained exotherm occurs.",
                "The ranges of CVD conditions in which Co x N films were deposited are shown in Table II. NH 3 gas was used as the nitrogen source and H 2 as the reducing agent. Although the ratio of NH 3 to H 2 gas flow was varied, the total flow rate of the mixture was always maintained at 60 sccm. 60 sccm of N 2 carrier gas passed through the bubbler to carry the precursor vapor into the deposition chamber. We assumed that an equilibrium vapor pressure of the Co precursor was achieved while the N 2 bubbled up through about 10 cm of the liquid. A total pressure drop of 6.3 torr was estimated between the bubbler and the reactor tube, most of it arising from the pressures required to open the three spring-loaded check valves installed downstream to the bubbler. The check valves (not shown in Fig. 1) were used to separate multiple precursors installed in two ovens and to avoid back flow of vapor to cooler parts of the system. The high total pressure in the bubbler reduces the partial pressure of the precursors in the reactor, thereby limiting the overall growth rate and the step coverage inside features with high-aspect ratios. The estimated partial pressures for the reacting species are presented in Table III. \u223c0.5 nm/min \u223c1 nm/min CVD WN was deposited from bis(tertbutylimido)bis(dimethylamido)tungsten(VI) vaporized from a bubbler at 85 \u2022 C and NH 3 gas. The deposition conditions for WN were 390 \u2022 C substrate temperature and 1 torr total pressure. The N 2 carrier gas and NH 3 flow rates were both set at 20 sccm. Cu metal or CuON was deposited from (N,N -di-sec-butylacetamidinato)copper (I). For Cu deposition, 40 sccm of H 2 was used as the reducing agent and 40 sccm of N 2 was bubbled through the molten precursor at 95 \u2022 C. The Cu deposition was carried out at 180 \u2022 C and 1 torr total pressure. An alternate route adopted to make smoother Cu films was to deposit CuON and reduce it after deposition at room temperature by hydrogen plasma. This process is discussed in detail elsewhere. 6 Multilayer films were deposited without air break in order to prevent any oxidation of the films.",
                "Substrates used in these experiments were 300 nm of thermally oxidized SiO 2 supported on Si wafers. Before deposition, the substrates were exposed to a mercury UV lamp in air for 10 min to remove any organic contamination. The substrates were then dipped briefly in 5% HF solution and rinsed in distilled water to expose fresh oxide surface by etching 20-30 nm of SiO 2 .",
                "The surface morphologies of the films were characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM, Asylum MFP-3D). The thicknesses of smoother films were measured by X-ray reflection (XRR, Scintag XDS 2000). For metals with rough surfaces, the films were patterned into stripes using photolithography and techniques, and the resulting thickness profiles were measured using AFM. The film composition and density were measured using 2 Mev He + Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The areal density of individual elements was determined by using a reference of Harwell Bi standard 22 and by using a glassy carbon substrate. The phases of as-deposited films were evaluated by electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEL2010), using as substrates a 50nm thick silicon nitride membrane suspended in a 3mm Si wafer (TEM grid, Ted Pella.) Cross-section electron imaging of thin films was carried using TEM (JEOL 2100) and SEM (Zeiss Supra55VP) to study epitaxy and step coverage, respectively, of as-deposited thin films. The sheet resistance was measured by a four point probe station (Miller Design & Equipment, FPP-500). The atomic concentrations of elements were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA SSX-100.) The interfacial adhesion energies were evaluated by the four-point bend test, as described elsewhere. 23 "

                "Properties of the liquid cobalt precursor.-Some additional properties of the cobalt precursor were measured. The viscosity as a function of temperature is given by ln \u03bc(cP) = 3365.5/T(K) -8.1694 and plotted in Fig. 2. Within the range of bubbler temperatures used, 70 to 85 \u2022 C, the viscosity is low, just 3 to 5 times that of water. Thus bubbling is not impeded by the viscosity of this precursor.  Heating the neat precursor at 120 \u2022 C in contact with glass, etched stainless steel or oxidized stainless steel for 60 hours did not generate any diamagnetic decomposition products in the NMR spectrum, indicating that thermal stability is not compromised by contact with these surfaces. An ARC test of stability was carried out. Slow, nonsustaining, transient exotherms were observed at 180, 210, and 219 \u2022 C. This test shows that little or no decomposition takes place at temperatures below 180 \u2022 C over periods of hours. These thermal stability tests have important implications for the vaporization of this cobalt precursor in a direct liquid injection (DLI) system. 24 In such a system, vaporization takes place within seconds, so that temperatures up to about 180 \u2022 C could be used without significant decomposition of the precursor. Thus much higher vapor pressures can be produced in a DLI system than in a traditional bubbler. Much higher precursor partial pressures translates into the ability to coat much narrower features conformally. 25 Chemical vapor deposition of Co x N.-Co x N films were deposited without an air-break on freshly-deposited WN in order to increase the adhesion energy of the films to substrates. Table IV shows RBS data for the composition of Co x N films deposited at 180 \u2022 C with various feed rates of NH 3 and H 2 . The area density of nitrogen atoms in Co x N was found by subtracting the area density of N in control samples of WN from the total number of N atoms per unit area detected by RBS in Co x N/WN/C. It is clear that N was incorporated into the asdeposited films only when NH 3 was introduced, irrespective of its flow rate. All of the films show metallic conduction, with resistivity increasing with nitrogen content.",
                "When Co x N was deposited with just NH 3 and no H 2 gas, a composition Co 2.3 N was obtained. Figure 3 shows an electron diffraction pattern for a Co 2.3 N film that corresponds to a Co 3 N phase with a hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure. The only phase that resulted from NH 3 alone as a co-reactant is the hcp (Co 3 N) phase.",
                "When H 2 was introduced along with NH 3 in different proportions, while maintaining the total flow rate of the two gases at 60 sccm, the as-deposited Co x N films became richer in cobalt (x > 2.3). Co precursor and H 2 gas alone (no NH 3 ) showed no reactivity at 180 \u2022 C because no film growth was detected at that temperature. Thus H 2 acts as a reducing agent during some stage of the reaction of the Co precursor with NH 3 at 180 \u2022 C even though it shows no direct reactivity with the Co precursor itself. The Co/N atomic ratio increases as the H 2 /NH 3 feed-ratio is increased.",
                "These cobalt-rich films exhibit a fcc structure as shown in Figure 3 for the NH 3 /H 2 = 20/40 sccm condition. A fcc Co 4 N phase has been reported by other groups 26,27 using sputtering. This is the first report of Co 4 N material with the fcc phase prepared using CVD. The crystal geometry of the Co 4 N phase can be considered to be made of Co atoms placed in a fcc lattice and a nitrogen atom trapped interstitially in the center of a unit cell. As a result, the introduction of N atoms should show expansion from the fcc Co lattice (a = 3.545 \u00c5). Theoretical studies of the Co 4 N phase 27 have shown that lattice expands as a function of interstitial nitrogen trapped per unit cell. Therefore it might be possible to adjust the lattice parameter of Co 4 N experimentally by controlling the amount of nitrogen in the film. The polycrystalline Co 4 N films have a relatively smooth morphology even when deposited on SiO 2 without WN underneath. The AFM image shown in Fig. 4a for a 20 nm Co 4 N film has a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness Hetero-epitaxial relation between Co 4 N and Cu.-During the processing of copper interconnects, it is critical for Cu to adhere strongly to the underlying barrier material. The minimum adhesion energy recommended between Cu and the barrier material in order to survive the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is 5 J \u00d7 m -2 . 28 Amorphous WN is a well-studied barrier material for copper interconnects application but exhibits poor adhesion with CVD copper (<2 J \u00d7 m -2 ). 3 In order to improve adhesion between Cu and WN, an interlayer of Co 4 N was tested. A stack of CVD Cu/Co 4 N/WN was deposited on SiO 2 /Si without breaking the vacuum. Fig. 5 shows the TEM cross section of the as-deposited film stack with sharp interfaces between the film stacks. The four-point bend test evaluation of the stack revealed adhesion energy of 10-13 J \u00d7 m -2 between Cu and Co 4 N, which is stronger than the reported adhesion energy 6 J \u00d7 m -2 of Ru glue layer. 11 The high resolution TEM image (Fig. 5) shows that Cu grew epitaxially on the Co 4 N. The lattice spacing seen in Figure 6 matches the 111 planes. The hetero-epitaxial relation between the two poly crystalline metals was discontinuous along the interface but was sufficient to promote strong adhesion.",
                "The lattice parameters of Co 4 N films with different amounts of nitrogen were evaluated by carrying out selected area electron diffraction (SAD) on thin films deposited on Si 3 N 4 TEM grids. Measurement of absolute lattice parameters from SAD diffraction patterns involved careful elimination of the instrumental errors. Cu was deposited on top of Co 4 N film to form a Cu/Co 4 N stack, where the lattice parameter of Cu (a = 3.615 \u00c5) served as an internal standard. For comparison, copper was also deposited directly on the TEM grids. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of diffraction patterns from Cu/Co 4 N stack, Cu and Co 4 N on TEM grids. The diffraction pattern on all three samples show three major rings that correspond to the 111 , 200 , 220 and 311   Step coverage of Co 4 N.-The step coverage of CVD Co 4 N was tested by depositing film on a silicon substrate with holes having an aspect ratio of 30:1 with a diameter 336 nm. The CVD conditions tested are tabulated in Table III. In the initial design of the system, there were 3 check valves between the cobalt bubbler and the reactor tube. The Co 4 N deposition with three check valves in the system had low step coverage, even with aspect ratio lower than 10:1, the step coverage was not satisfactory. After removal of two check valves, it is found that step coverage on structures with aspect ratio of 30:1 is achieved with only a 20% reduction in film thickness on the bottom of the hole (\u223c23.5 nm) compared with the top of the hole (\u223c30 nm). The step coverage tends to be poor when the CVD reaction is operating in transport-limited conditions of low partial pressure of the precursor inside the reactor and high surface reaction rate. Table III presents the partial pressures of different gases before and after removal of check valves. After the removal of two check valves, the partial pressure of cobalt precursor is 0.04 torr compared to 0.02 torr before the system optimization. The growth rate of the cobalt nitride film increased to 1nm/min from 0.5nm/min. Fig. 9 shows an SEM image of nearly conformal deposition of Co 4 N down to an aspect ratio of 30:1 in a hole. The overall step coverage can be improved by eliminating the back pressure from the check valves, increasing the vaporization temperature of the Co bubbler or by using DLI to make higher partial pressures of the precursor vapor. 25 "

                "In this article we report Chemical Vapor Deposition synthesis of smooth, continuous and conformal Co 4 N thin films using a cobalt amidinate, Co[Bu t NC(Et)NEt] 2 , as the cobalt source and a combination of NH 3 and H 2 gases. Although H 2 shows no reactivity with the Co precursor at 180 \u2022 C, it stabilizes Co 4 N into a face centered cubic structure in the presence of NH 3 feed. In the absence of H 2 , the reaction between Co precursor and NH 3 yields the Co 3 N phase, which has a hexagonal close packed structure. The fcc structure of the Co 4 N phase exhibits low (-1%) mismatch with that of Cu and therefore shows a strong bonding (adhesion energy: 10-13 Joules m -2 ) at the Co 4 N/Cu interface. The stability of the interface was tested up to 400 \u2022 C with no evidence of intermixing. Thus Co 4 N, which has a fcc structure, is a good choice for an adhesion-promoting under-layer for conformal methods of forming the Cu seed layers for advanced copper interconnects."
