                        "The development of gene recombination techniques has rapidly expanded the market of protein-based pharmaceutical products such as therapeutic proteins and antibody drugs. Among them, antibody drugs do not cause adverse immune responses when administered to the human body and are under active development because of their high specificity.",
                        "Examples of hosts to produce the protein-based pharmaceutical products typified by antibody drugs can include microorganisms, yeasts, insects, animal and plant cells, and transgenic animals and plants. Posttranslational modification such as folding or sugar chain modification is essential for the physiological activity or antigenicity of the protein-based pharmaceutical products. Therefore, microorganisms which cannot perform complicated posttranslational modification, or plants which differ significantly in sugar chain structure from humans are not suitable as hosts. Cultured mammalian cells, such as CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, are currently mainstream due to their having a sugar chain structure similar to that of humans and permitting posttranslational modification, and further in consideration of safety.",
                        "Use of cultured mammalian cells as a host presents problems such as low growth rates, low productivity and high cost as compared with microorganisms or the like (Non Patent Literature 1). Furthermore, clinical utilization of protein-based pharmaceutical products requires administering the pharmaceutical products at large doses. Therefore, a lack of sufficient production capacity thereof has been a global issue. In the case of producing a protein-based pharmaceutical product in a cultured mammalian cell expression system, reduction in production cost has been attempted by making improvements to each production step, because the production cost is higher than that of synthetic low-molecular weight pharmaceutical products. However, increasing the amount of protein produced in the cultured mammalian cell expression system is also a promising method for reduction in production cost (Non Patent Literature 2 and 3). Accordingly, in order to increase the productivity of foreign genes in cultured mammalian cells, many approaches such as promoters, enhancers, drug selection markers, gene amplification and culture engineering approaches have been practiced so far through trial and error. In the case of using CHO cells as host cells, a human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (hereinafter, referred to as a CMV promoter) derived from a virus is generally used for the expression of foreign genes, i.e., the production of protein-based pharmaceutical products (Non Patent Literature 4, 5 and 6). It is also known that a polynucleotide upstream of the transcription start site of the gene (promoter region) of elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1\u03b1) (Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 7) or a human ribosomal protein RPL32 or RPS11 can be used alone or in combination with an additional heterologous promoter in protein expression in CHO cells (Non Patent Literature 8 and Patent Literature 2). However, these promoters regulate the expression of their downstream foreign genes in response to the intracellular physiological conditions of the cultured mammalian cells serving as a host, and often exhibit the maximum activity in the logarithmic growth phase in which the cultured mammalian cells actively proliferate. Thus, the activity of such a promoter is often attenuated in the stationary phase after the cell density reaches its maximum level. Hence, there is a demand for the development of a promoter that permits strong expression of a foreign gene throughout the culture period of cultured mammalian cells."

The DNA element for combined use can be obtained by interaction with acetylated histone H3 as an indicator. In general, the acetylation of histone (H3, H4) is reportedly involved in the activation of transcription on the basis of two main hypotheses: that conformational change of the nucleosome is involved such that histone tail acetylation neutralizes the charge thereof to loosen the binding between the DNA and the histone (Mellor J. (2006) Dynamic nucleosomes and gene transcription. Trends Genet. 22 (6): 320-329); and that the acetylation is involved in the recruitment of various transcription factors (Nakatani Y. (2001) Histone acetylases\u2014versatile players. Genes Cells. 6 (2): 79-86). Both of the hypotheses strongly suggest that the acetylation of histone is involved in transcriptional activation. Thus, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody is capable of enriching a sample for a DNA element that interacts with acetylated histone H3.",

The polynucleotide can be isolated, for example, by screening a cDNA library derived from cells or tissues expressing the foreign gene, using a DNA probe synthesized on the basis of the gene fragment. mRNA can be prepared by an approach usually used in the art. For example, the cells or the tissues are treated with a guanidine reagent, a phenol reagent, or the like to obtain total RNA. Then, poly(A)+RNA (mRNA) is obtained therefrom by the affinity column method using an oligo(dT) cellulose column, polyU-Sepharose with Sepharose 2B as a carrier, or the like, or by the batch method. The poly(A)+RNA may be further fractionated by the sucrose density gradient centrifugation method or the like. Subsequently, single-stranded cDNA is synthesized with the obtained mRNA as a template using an oligo dT primer and reverse transcriptase. Double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from the single-stranded cDNA using DNA synthetase I, DNA ligase and RNase H, etc. The synthesized double-stranded cDNA is blunt-ended with T4 DNA synthetase, then subjected to the linkage of an adaptor (e.g., an EcoRI adaptor), phosphorylation, etc., and incorporated into a X phage such as \u03bbgt11 for in vivo packaging to prepare a cDNA library. Alternatively, the cDNA library may be prepared using a plasmid vector instead of the X phage. Then, a clone having the DNA of interest (positive clone) can be selected from the cDNA library.",

The extraction of the genomic DNA can be performed according to, for example, the method of Cryer et al. (Methods in Cell Biology, 12, 39-44 (1975)) and the method of P. Philippsen et al. (Methods Enzymol., 194, 169-182 (1991)).",
                        "The obtaining of the polynucleotide of interest comprising the promoter, the DNA element, or a foreign gene can also be performed by, for example, PCR (PCR Technology. Henry A. Erlich, Atockton press (1989)). The amplification of the polynucleotide by PCR employs 20 to 30 mer synthetic single-stranded DNA as a primer and genomic DNA as a template. The amplified gene is used after its polynucleotide sequence is confirmed. A genomic DNA library such as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library may be used as a template for PCR.",
                        "On the other hand, a polynucleotide comprising a foreign gene having an unknown sequence can be obtained by (a) preparing a gene library according to a common method, (b) selecting the desired polynucleotide from the prepared gene library, and amplifying the polynucleotide. The gene library can be prepared by partially digesting chromosomal DNA obtained by a common method from a cell line of an organism serving as a source, with an appropriate restriction enzyme to prepare fragments, ligating the obtained fragments to an appropriate vector, and introducing the vector into an appropriate host. Alternatively, the gene library may be prepared by extracting mRNA from the cells, synthesizing cDNA therefrom, then ligating the cDNA to an appropriate vector, and introducing the vector into an appropriate host. In this respect, a plasmid known as a well known vector for gene library preparation can be used as the vector, and a phage vector or a cosmid, etc. can also be widely used. The host to be transformed or transduced can be used according to the type of vector. The polynucleotide comprising a foreign gene is selected from the gene library by colony hybridization, plaque hybridization, or the like using a labeled probe comprising a sequence unique to the foreign gene.",
                        "The polynucleotide comprising a foreign gene can also be synthesized entirely chemically. The gene can be synthesized by, for example, a method of preparing one pair of complementary oligonucleotides and annealing these, a method of ligating several annealed DNAs using DNA ligase, or a method of preparing several partially complementary oligonucleotides and filling gaps therein by PCR.",

The foreign gene expression vector for use in the method for producing a foreign gene-derived protein according to the present invention may comprise one of the DNA elements described in the preceding section 3., two or more copies of one DNA element, or a combination of two or more DNA elements. When a foreign gene is expressed in host cells using the foreign gene expression vector, the DNA element may be located immediately preceding or immediately following the gene expression unit, or may be located at a position distant from the gene expression unit. Alternatively, one foreign gene expression vector comprising a plurality of DNA elements may be used.

Also, Fab\u2032, which is a monovalent fragment of antibody variable regions obtained by the treatment of F(ab\u2032)2 under reductive conditions is included in the antigen-binding fragment of the antibody. However, the antigen-binding fragment is not limited to these molecules as long as it has antigen-binding ability.

Alternatively, the transformant may be selected by using, as a marker, a gene that confers, for example, solvent resistance to ethanol or the like, osmotic pressure resistance to glycerol, a salt, or the like, or metal ion resistance to copper or the like.",
                        "The foreign gene expression vector for use in the method for producing a foreign gene-derived protein according to the present invention may be a vector that is not integrated into chromosomal DNA. In general, the foreign gene expression vector is randomly integrated into the chromosome after transfection of host cells. By contrast, use of a constituent derived from a mammalian virus such as simian virus 40 (SV40), papillomavirus (BPV, HPV), or EBV allows the foreign gene expression vector to be used as an episomal vector capable of replicating autonomously in the transfected host cells. For example, a vector having a sequence encoding a SV40-derived replication origin and a trans-acting factor SV40 large T antigen, or a vector having a sequence encoding EBV-derived oriP and EBNA-1 is widely used. The DNA element is capable of exhibiting foreign gene expression-enhancing activity, regardless of the type of vector or the presence or absence of integration into the chromosome.",

The antibody protein is a tetramer protein consisting of two molecules of a heavy chain polypeptide and two molecules of a light chain polypeptide. Thus, for obtaining an antibody protein in a form that maintains antigen-binding ability, it is necessary to introduce both heavy chain and light chain genes into the transformed cells described in the preceding section 6.
