                        "Doping of bulk semiconductors, the process of intentional introduction of impurity atoms into a crystal discovered back in the 1940s, is a key route for tuning their properties. Its introduction allowed the wide-spread application of semiconductors in electronic and electro-optic components [1]. Controlling the size and dimensionality of semiconductor structures is an additional powerful way to tune their properties via quantum confinement effects. In this respect, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals have emerged as a family of materials with size dependent optical and electronic properties. Combined with their capability for wet-chemical processing, this has led to nanocrystal-based light emitting diodes, solar cells and transistor devices prepared via facile and scalable bottom-up approaches. Impurity doping in such colloidal nanocrystals still remains an open challenge [2]. From the synthesis side, the introduction of a few impurity atoms into a nanocrystal which contains only a few hundred atoms may lead to their expulsion to the surface [3-5] or compromise the crystal structure. This inherently creates a highly doped nanocrystal under strong quantum confinement, and the electronic and optical properties in such circumstances are still unresolved.",
                        "Several strategies have been employed so far for doping nanocrystals. Binding ligands on the nanoparticle surface, which can donate carriers, or electrochemical carrier injection, have been shown to yield n-type doping in semiconductor nanocrystal superlattices [6-8]. While of great interest, such remote doping differs from substitutional doping, which has been studied mainly for color center impurities [9] and magnetic impurities, notably Mn atoms [10,11], providing insight to the challenging chemistry [12]. It should be noted, that despite efforts to concentrate such doping solely in the nanocrystal, significant amounts of the dopant materials were found associated with the nanocrystals surface.",
                        "Introduction of dopant precursors at specific stages of nanoparticle growth were effective in controlling the impurity location [13]. More recently, some progress has been made towards producing n-type CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) using tin and indium impurities [14, 15], and p-type InP using Cu impurities [16]."

However, for strongly confined colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, doping has proven elusive. This arises both from the synthetic challenge of how to introduce single impurities and from a lack of fundamental understanding of this heavily doped limit under strong quantum confinement.

In a bulk semiconductor this is already within an exceedingly highly-doped limit, where metallic (\u2018degenerate\u2019) behavior is expected. Doping at this level in bulk semiconductors leads to the several effects summarized in FIG. 1A. First, at high doping levels the impurities interact with each other and an impurity sub-band emerges near the edge of the respective band (conduction or valence for n- or p-type, respectively). Often, tail states (Urbach tail) also develop due to distortions in the crystal structure. Effectively, the band gap, Eg, is narrowed. This may be probed by optical means where for highly doped n-type semiconductor (left frame in FIG. 1A) the absorption is blue shifted due to conduction band filling by the donated electrons (Moss-Burstein effect), and the emission emanating from the bottom of the conduction band is red-shifted. For high p-type doping, both absorption and emission are typically seen to be red-shifted due to the complexity of the valence band dominated by the band-tailing effect.",
                        "A dramatically different situation arises for electronic impurity doping of nanocrystals due to the discrete nature of the quantum confined states (FIG. 1B, for n-type doping). In this case the addition of a single dopant (left frame) significantly alters the density of states (DOS) due to the introduction of the impurity levels, a situation which is not expected for prior remote surface doping strategies. This has been described by a hydrogenic model under spherical confinement, leading to S- and P-like impurity states denoted by Ed1S and Ed2P that are several tens of meVs (\u0394) below the corresponding dot levels, effectively doubling the DOS near those energies. Even more intriguing is the system of the present invention, of multiple impurities in a single nanocrystal, which are inherently interacting due to the small volume and experience the effect of confining potential (FIG. 1B, right frame). Under these conditions of heavily doped semiconductor nanocrystals, the nature of delocalization and interaction of the impurity charge carriers may be greatly modified as compared to the bulk case. In addition, multiple impurities in a small confined nanocrystal can enhance disorder effects, altering the electronic structure via a quantum-confined Urbach tail mechanism.",
                        "To dope InAs nanocrystals with different impurity atoms, the inventors of the present invention have modified a reaction used for gold growth onto semiconductor nanoparticles [17], demonstrating phase separation between InAs and impurity metal regions (domains). As FIG. 2A shows, for nanoparticles prepared according to the present invention, at the impurity levels recited herein, it was not possible to identify the presence of metal regions (domains). This clearly indicates that the dopant atoms were dispersed. It should be noted that this was not the case for very high metal atom concentrations (\u02dc3000 atoms per QD in the reaction solution) prepared in accordance with prior processes [17], where TEM analysis clearly showed phase separation between InAs and impurity metal regions.",
                        "Further support for the dispersion of impurities is provided by X-ray diffraction (data not shown), where no fingerprints of metal domains were detected while the InAs crystal structure was generally maintained. Some broadening of the peaks was observed, ascribed to a small degree of structural disorder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of these samples were also performed indicating the presence of dopant atoms (Ag, Au or Cu) in the respective samples (data not shown). This suggests successful addition of these atoms to the InAs QDs. Indeed, extrapolating the diffusion parameter values to room temperature gives a diffusion length scale for Au in InAs of \u02dc104 nm/24 h, far greater than the QD diameter, and large values are also extrapolated for Ag and Cu in InAs at room temperature.",
                        "FIG. 2B shows the absorption and emission (inset) spectra of undoped and doped InAs QDs. The addition of Ag atoms resulted in a red-shift of both the first exciton absorption and the emission peaks. The addition of Cu resulted in a blue-shift of the first exciton absorption peak whereas the emission was not shifted. Addition of Au at similar concentrations did not significantly alter the observed optical gap neither in absorption nor in emission. The addition of any of these impurity atoms resulted in the gradual quenching of the emission from the QDs, yet the three impurities led to qualitatively different effects on the optical spectra and hence on the electronic properties of the doped QDs.",
                        "The effect of varying amounts of impurities on the first absorption peak and on the emission is shown in FIG. 2C for InAs QDs with different diameters, FIGS. 3 and 4 represents the individual spectra. The treatment of the InAs nanocrystals with the Cu solution led to an increase in the first exciton energy (Error! Reference source not found.Error! Reference source not found.Error! Reference source not found.Error! Reference source not found.A-C) while the emission energy was unchanged (FIG. 3D-F). Ag treatment led to a decrease in both the first exciton energy (FIG. 4A-B) and in the emission energy (FIG. 4C-D). All metal treatments resulted in some quenching of the emission. This was totally quenched after precipitation.",
                        "The amount of impurities in the QDs was estimated by the analytical method of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, FIGS. 5-6). To perform this analysis, the doping reaction was carried out as described above on a range of NC sizes and at different metal precursors concentrations. The NCs were then precipitated using a non-solvent added to the solution and separated by centrifugation, dissolved using concentrated HNO3 and diluted with triply distilled water. The relative quantities of In, As, Cu, Ag and Au in these solutions was measured by ICP-AES. The amount of Cu/Ag/Au per NC was extrapolated using the ratio of In and As to Cu/Ag/Au atoms together with the estimated number of In and As atoms per NC estimated from the NC size. The results are shown for Cu and Ag in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. These graphs represent the number of metal atoms per NC extrapolated from the ICP measurements against the metal:NC solution ratio. FIG. 5 shows the dependence of the number of Cu atoms per NC on the Cu:NC solution ratio. For each size the results were fitted and the interpolated relationship was used to calibrate the number of Cu atoms per NC reported here. The number of Ag atoms per NC on the Ag:NC solution ratio showed two regimes as can be seen in FIG. 6.",
                        "A first possible source of optical spectral shifts in such quantum confined particles may be related to size changes upon doping, but this was excluded by detailed sizing analysis (data not shown). An alternative source of the spectral shifts can be associated with electronic doping by the impurities. In FIG. 7 shown are the tunneling spectra measured by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at T=4.2K for undoped, Au-doped, Cu-doped and Ag-doped InAs QDs 4.2 nm in diameter. Starting from the reference case of the undoped QD shown in the lower panel, the dI/dV curves, which are proportional to the DOS (density of states), match earlier studies of InAs QDs. The gap region is clearly identified, while on the positive bias side a doublet of peaks associated with tunneling through the doubly degenerate 1S, nanocrystal confined conduction band state is seen at the onset of the current, followed by higher order multiplet at higher bias corresponding to tunneling through the 1P, conduction band state. A more complex peak structure is seen on the negative bias side, resulting from tunneling through the closely spaced and intricate valence band states of the InAs nanocrystal.",
                        "Several changes were seen upon doping the QDs. Starting with the case of Au, the gap was similar to the undoped NC, consistent with the optical measurements. However, the features in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) spectra were washed out, suggesting that indeed Au entered the nanocrystal, perturbing the pristine level structure. More significant changes were seen for both the Cu and Ag cases, presented in the upper panel. Significant band-tailing into the gap and emergence of in-gap states in regions covering nearly 40% of the gap region were observed. In particular, in the Cu case, a shoulder on a tail-state structure was seen at bias values just below the 1Sc conduction band doublet (which is remarkably preserved). Additionally, the doublet was superimposed on a notable rising background that increased to the region of the 1Pe peaks that are not well resolved. For the Ag-doped QDs, there was a significant broadening and merging of features on the positive bias side, and on the negative bias side a background signal develops.",
                        "A clear result of doping in bulk semiconductors was the shift of the Fermi level, which for n-type doping was close to the conduction band, and conversely, shifts to a lower energy close to the valence band, for p-type impurities. Remarkably, such shifts were clearly identified in the STS of the Cu and Ag doped QDs measured by the positions of the band edges relative to zero bias. While the zero bias position for the undoped case, as well as the Au doped case, was nearly centered in between the valence band and conduction band onsets, in the Cu-case the onset of the conduction band states nearly merges with the zero bias position. Considering that this relative shift corresponds to a relative measure of the Fermi level of the nanoparticle, this shift is clearly indicating n-type doping in this case. In contrast, for the Ag case, the zero bias was much closer to the onset of the valence band states. Therefore the Fermi level is now close to the valence band signifying p-type doping in this case.",
                        "Chemical considerations for the doping of InAs with the different metal atom impurities can help to understand these observations. Cu can have a formal oxidation state of either Cu2+/1+. Moreover, its ionic radius is the smallest of the three impurities and therefore may be accommodated in interstitial sites within the InAs lattice. In such a case, one can expect that the Cu will partly donate its valence electrons to the QD (quantum dot) leading to n-type doping, consistent with the shift in the Fermi energy observed by STS. The incorporation of multiple impurities is expected to lead to the development of closely spaced impurity states, akin to the impurity band formed in the bulk. This band forms asymmetrically due to the disordered arrangement of the impurities in the QD, surpassing the energy of the 1Se NC state. The observed rising background in the STS curve signifies the presence of such an impurity band. This is a direct indication of the substantial modification of the DOS induced by the impurities in small QDs, corresponding to very highly doped behavior in the bulk. Revisiting the observed blue shift in the absorption, this is in line with the filling of the conduction and asymmetric impurity-band levels in heavily n-type doped QD, leading to a Moss-Burstein blue-shift in the absorption spectrum and minor shifts in the emission (FIG. 2).",
                        "Ag has a large radius, and is considered to be a substitutional impurity in III-V semiconductors. The replacement of an In atom, which possesses three valence electrons, with a Ag atom, which has only one valence electron, leads to an electron deficiency in the bonding orbitals causing p-type doping. This is reflected in the shift of the Fermi level, as seen in the STS data (FIG. 7, dotted trace). In this case, the rising background in the spectrum at negative bias, indicates the formation of an impurity band near the valence band. Since Ag has the largest ionic radius of the three impurities, it distorts the crystal structure most significantly; this results in band-tailing analogous to the Urbach tail known for highly doped bulk semiconductors, and leading to the red shifts observed in the absorption onset as well as the emission (FIG. 2). Au may adopt a +3 valence state, which makes it isovalent with In and hence doping is not expected to lead to the introduction of charge carriers. Moreover, its size is comparable to that of the In, allowing for substitutional doping without significant lattice distortions. These features of Au are consistent with the absence of significant shifts in absorption, emission and Fermi energy, as observed in both optical and tunneling spectra."
