                        "Hemipteran insects are devastating pests of crops due to their wide host range, rapid reproduction, and ability to transmit numerous plant-infecting phytopathogens as vectors. While the field of plant-virus-vector interactions has flourished in recent years, plant-bacteria-vector interactions remain poorly understood. Leafhoppers and psyllids are by far the most important vectors of bacterial pathogens, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of their feeding behavior, salivary secretions, and plant responses as compared to important viral vectors, such as whiteflies and aphids.",
                        "Hemipteran pests, such as whiteflies, aphids, psyllids, and leafhoppers have specialized mouthparts, known as stylets, allow hemipterans to penetrate the plant's epidermal tissues and reach their preferred tissue. Some hemipterans feed from the mesophyll and vascular system, while others only probe the mesophyll and feed exclusively from the phloem or xylem. As a result of this specialized feeding, hemipterans interact with microbes colonizing the plant vascular system and can serve as vectors for devastating plant viruses and bacteria.",
                        "For example, the bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2032 carried by hemipteran insects cause severe yield losses in the Solanaceae such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), tomato (S. lycopersicum L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) as well as Rutaceae (Citrus spp.) families. Potato zebra chip (ZC) disease, is also caused by Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum\u2032 (CLso); its insect vector is the tomato potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli (\u0160ulc); [Hemiptera: Triozidae]).",
                        "Since its discovery in 1994, ZC has been documented in several commercial potato-growing regions of the United States, Mexico, Central America, Australia and New Zealand, causing yield losses of up to 94%. Similarly, citrus greening or huanglongbing (HLB), putatively caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas), Candidatus Liberibacter africanus, or Candidatus Liberibacter americanus, is the most devastating disease threatening citrus production worldwide; its insect vector is the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama [Hemiptera: Liviidae]).",
                        "Between 2006 and 2011, HLB caused losses of more than US$4.5 billion in the US state of Florida alone. CLas and CLso share some commonalities, such as their unculturable nature, genomic attributes and lifestyles as psyllid-vectored and phloem-limited bacteria. These and other diseases caused by fastidious plant pathogens are major threats to global agriculture and food security.",

Chlorpropamide is in a class of medications called sulfonylureas. Chlorpropamide lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Chlorpropamide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated)."

It is commonly used as an eye drop during pediatric eye examinations to dilate the eye (mydriatic) and prevent the eye from focusing/accommodating (cycloplegic). Cyclopentolate or atropine can also be administered to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration. Cyclopentolate was first synthesized in as a chemical analogue of atropine. It was one of several derivatives of an analogue to tropic acid which were tested for pharmacological action in a search for new and better antisposmodic agents.",

Candidatus Liberibacter are Gram-negative bacteria that live as phloem-limited obligate parasites in plants. These bacteria are transmitted by psyllids, which feed on plant phloem sap. Citrus huanglongbing (yellow shoot) or citrus greening disease is associated with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, Candidatus liberibacter africanus, or Candidatus Liberibacter americanus. Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus is the most severe pathogen, spread by Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri and causing devastating epidemics in several countries. Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum is associated with diseases in several solanaceous plants and transmitted by potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli. Zebra chip disease is causing large damage in potato crops in North America. In Europe Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum is associated with diseases of the Apiaceae family of plants, carrot and celery, and transmitted by psyllids Trioza apicalis and Bactericera trigonica."

Specifically, since Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2032 (CLso and CLas) are phloem-limited pathogens, the method includes the use of plant hairy roots, which possess intact vasculature, to support their growth.",
                                "Hairy roots are functional plant tissues that mimic the pathogen's native host root environment. Hence, we leveraged them to conduct functional screening as a means to identify novel therapies that can inhibit Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2032 Because CLas and CLso are closely related to each other, we focused mainly on CLso hairy root cultures for functional screening due to faster growth of potato hairy roots compared to citrus hairy roots.",
                                "We sought to find short- to intermediate-term solutions, and we therefore conducted high-throughput screening of small-molecule inhibitors among a diverse collection of bioactive compounds approved for use in United States and other countries (Microsource Discovery Systems, Inc.). For this, we developed an in vitro multi-well plate assay using the microbial hairy root cultures, which is scalable from 12- to 48- to 96-well layout. Briefly, we generated hairy root cultures, transferred them to a multi-well plate containing growth medium to maintain the hairy root cultures, and then added small molecules of interest to the assay plates and incubated the cultures for 72 h (FIG. 1a). We performed a primary screening with \u02dc220 compounds in CLso hairy root cultures, using two biological replicates per compound (10 \u03bcM) along with untreated or solvent-alone controls (DMSO, 0.1% v/v). By molecular diagnostics, we identified nine molecules that inhibited CLso titers by >50-70% when compared to the untreated controls (Supplementary Dataset 1). We re-tested these nine molecules using five biological replicates, alongside a reference antibiotic, tetracycline (TC, 250 ppm), that was previously reported to inhibit CLas in planta. We also screened the efficacy of the nine compounds (25 \u03bcM) and tetracycline (TC, 500 ppm) in CLas hairy root cultures. Seven out of the nine test compounds, as well as tetracycline, consistently showed statistically significant (P\u22640.05 or 0.01) inhibition of CLso (FIG. 1b). Four compounds showed statistically significant (P\u22640.05 or 0.01) inhibition of CLas, on par with tetracycline (FIG. 1c). Three compounds inhibited both CLso and CLas (#3, #8 and #9) (FIGS. 1b, c). In general, the active compounds appear to possess diverse structures and bioactive profiles (FIG. 1-m): three of them were indexed as antibacterial, whereas others were classified as antifungal, antiprotozoal, hemostatic, antihistaminic, antidiabetic and mydriactic drugs targeting various biological processes. Note that since the re-tested nine molecules were originally pre-screened in CLso cultures (Supplementary Dataset 1), it is very likely that further re-screening of the entire library using CLas hairy root cultures would identify additional hits.",
                                "Delivery of small molecules into the plant phloem, especially in hardy perennial citrus trees, is a major challenge. The most practical and common approach is foliar spraying; however, this was shown to be relatively ineffective in citrus as a means to deliver bactericides such as oxytetracycline to inhibit CLas. Multiple research groups are evaluating alternative approaches, such as trunk injection, laser ablation and/or nanoparticle-based systems. Potato plants are relatively easier to handle and are amenable to foliar spraying techniques. Thus, to determine the in-planta efficacy of the three new molecules that showed good inhibitory activity against both CLso and CLas (#3, #8 and #9) in the hairy root assays (FIG. 1), we used the CLso\u2014potato plant system. First, we repeated efficacy assays in CLso\u2014potato microbial hairy root cultures, testing a broader range of concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25 and 50 \u03bcM) (FIG. 2) to establish a general dose-response curve. Based on these results, 10 and 25 \u03bcM concentrations were chosen for in planta foliar spraying experiments. Plants were sprayed with each compound twice a week, alongside untreated plants and tetracycline (250 ppm)-treated plants as negative and positive controls, respectively. Disease progression was monitored for 28 days post-infection (dpi), by which time untreated plants showed the typical foliar disease symptoms such as chlorosis, necrosis, leaf curling and wilting, and were quite close to dying (FIG. 2). In contrast, potatoes sprayed with any of the three test molecules showed a clearly lower level of disease symptoms that was also dose-dependent, i.e., plants sprayed with 25 \u03bcM showed the least symptoms, followed by those sprayed with 10 \u03bcM and untreated plants, and the level of protection was on par with that from tetracycline treatment (FIG. 2a). The attenuated symptoms also correlated with lowered CLso titers in the respective treatment groups when compared to untreated controls (FIG. 2b). Together, these experiments demonstrate that the newly identified compounds can inhibit Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2032 in planta, and the efficacy results conform with the results of the hairy root bioassays.",
                                "A recent consensus study by the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the status of the citrus greening research and development concluded that there is no single effective therapy to fight the disease. This holds true not only for citrus greening, but also for other insect-vectored diseases caused by Candidatus Liberibacter spp. The NAS report also suggested deployment of a combination of therapies and management practices to combat the disease. However, a major challenge in finding new therapies has been the unculturable nature of \u2018Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2019, which makes conventional gene- or chemical-therapy evaluation are laborious and time-consuming. For instance, evaluating the efficacy of an antimicrobial peptide using either stable transformation or transient viral vectors (e.g., tobacco rattle virus and citrus tristeza virus) followed by disease challenges in mature plants could take from 6 months to several years. Similarly, screening of small-molecule inhibitors or active ingredients by foliar spraying, by stem injection or by grafting using mature plants is inherently variable due to the challenges associated with delivery of the inhibitors to the bacteria that reside unevenly within the plant vasculature. Furthermore, the latter approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and hence not suitable for high-throughput studies. Researchers have also resorted to using distantly related microbes as surrogates. However, these results may or may not be reliable or extrapolatable to the target pathogen, owing to differences in pathosystems and virulence mechanisms (or lack thereof).",
                                "In a manner similar to the classical culture strategies for mammalian viruses in host cells, tissues and embryonated eggs, our experiments demonstrate that plant hairy roots can be used for ex vivo culture and propagation of fastidious pathogens like \u2018Candidatus Liberibacter spp.\u2019 As short-term therapies, we identified eight new bioactive compounds that are quite diverse in their chemical structures and modes of action (FIG. 1). All these, either individually or in combinations, could be further deployed in the host plants to develop robust resistance against these phytopathogens.",
                                "Another advantage of using the microbial hairy root system is that the screening can be accomplished four to six times faster than with conventional approaches. For instance, small molecules or peptides can be screened using in vitro hairy root assays in \u02dc72 h (FIG. 1), vs. several weeks to months when using conventional in planta approaches (FIG. 2).",

The presence and haplotype of CLso in the psyllid colonies were periodically confirmed using PCR, with primers specific to the single sequence repeat (SSR) loci of CLso. To generate CLso-infected plants, 1-month-old potato and tomato plants were challenged with \u02dc20 psyllids harboring CLso. The psyllids were released onto the plants in an enclosed organza bag tied to a lower branch with fully expanded leaves and were allowed to feed for 1 week. Subsequently, the bags and psyllids were removed from the plant, and the unchallenged upper branches were sampled periodically using PCR, as described below, to confirm the systemic spread of CLso in the plants, which typically could be detected at around 14 days post-challenge.",

Newly formed hairy roots were monitored regularly and confirmed using GFP visualization with fluorescence microscopy (Olympus Corporation, Japan). The hairy root transformation efficiency was calculated using the following formula: number of GFP-positive roots/total number of roots\u00d7100.",
                                "The transformation of the hairy roots was further confirmed using PCR amplification of either the GFP or rolB/rolC genes encoded on the binary and Ri T-DNA plasmids, respectively, which were transformed into the hairy root cultures. The Solanaceae RPL2 and citrus GAPC2 endogenous genes were used as the PCR controls. The presence and estimated titers of CLso in the infected hairy root cultures were assessed by amplification of CLso 16s rDNA using specific primers (OA2-F/OI2c-R and Lso-F/HLB-R)35,36, whereas CLas was estimated using specific markers for genes encoding ribosomal protein (rp1A, A2-F/J5-R) and ribonucleotide reductase \u03b2-subunit gene (nrdB, RNR-F/RNR-R). Sanger sequencing and BLAST analysis further confirmed the identity of CLso and CLas PCR amplicons. The temporal growth patterns of CLso and CLas in the hairy roots were assessed by determining the titers at various days after hairy root culture initiation (dpi). CLso samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 dpi, whereas CLas samples were collected at 0, 30, 90, 120 and 180 dpi. To estimate the copy number, we generated standard curves for CLso and CLas and used the regression equation to determine the genome equivalents.",

                                "High-throughput screening of small molecules was performed using \u02dc220 compounds from the Spectrum bioactives collection (Microsource Discovery Systems, Inc., Conn., USA). Primary screening was performed with two biological replicates of each compound (10 \u03bcM), along with untreated and solvent-alone negative controls (DMSO, 0.1% v/v). Briefly, \u02dc200 mg of the CLso hairy root cultures was surface sterilized with 2% bleach and then washed five times with sterile distilled water. The hairy roots were transferred into multi-well plates containing Gamborg's B-5 medium with 1% sucrose. The compounds were then added to the plate, and the medium was vacuum infiltrated at \u02dc200 kPa to facilitate the penetration of the molecules into the hairy root matrices. The cultures were incubated on an end-on shaker at 60 rpm in the dark at 21\u00b0 C. for 72 h. The hairy root tissues were sampled after 72 h, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. in preparation for further processing. The most effective compounds identified in the primary screening were re-tested at both at 10 and 25 \u03bcM, using five biological replicates each, in both CLso and CLas hairy root cultures, respectively, along with tetracycline as a positive control. The structures of the different chemical compounds were determined using ChemSpider (chemspider.com).",

                                "Three-week-old potato (var. Atlantic) plants were challenged with CLso-containing to psyllids. Briefly, five psyllids carrying CLso were restricted to the lowest branch of the plant and contained using an organza drawstring bag tied around the branch. After 1 week, the bags containing psyllids were clipped off the plant to prevent the escape of the newly emerging psyllids and/or nymphs. All the challenged plants were treated with either 0 (untreated), 10 or 25 \u03bcM of the selected compounds and tetracycline (250 ppm) twice a week for up to 4 weeks. To enhance penetration into leaf tissues, all the compounds were mixed with R-11 non-ionic surfactant, which improves the activity and efficacy of the spray application by reducing surface tension and increasing penetration into the plant surface. Four biological replicate plants were included for each treatment. The visual disease symptoms on the plants were monitored weekly, and tissue samples were collected (as described above) at 28 dpi for molecular diagnostics as described below.",
                                "To determine the effects of small molecules on the CLso and CLas titers within the hairy root cultures and plants, qPCR analysis was performed using DNA isolated from the various samples. DNA was isolated from \u02dc200 mg of tissue homogenized using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), as described previously. The quality and quantity of DNA were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Approximately 50 ng total DNA was used for the qPCR analysis, which was performed on a CFX384\u2122 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using iTaq\u2122 universal SYBR\u00ae Green supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories), following the manufacturer's instructions. The CLso 16S rDNA-specific primers (OA2-F/OI2c-R and Lso-F/HLB-R) were used to detect CLso, whereas primers for the CLas genes encoding ribosomal protein (rp1A, A2-F/J5-R) and ribonucleotide reductase \u03b2-subunit (nrdB, RNR-F/RNR-R) were used to detect CLas. A dissociation or melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the lack of nonspecific amplification and primer-dimers. For the antimicrobial treatments, the relative CLso titers were estimated using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method. The CLso Ct values were normalized to RPL2 to correct for concentration differences in the DNA templates among the samples and were plotted relative to the level in the control (DMSO-treated) CLso hairy root samples, which was set to 100%. Student's t-test was used to determine statistically significant (P\u22640.05 or 0.01) differences among the controls and treatments.",
