                        "Localization of plasminogen and plasminogen activators on cell surfaces arms cells with the proteolytic activity of plasmin. Cell surface proteolysis by plasmin is an essential feature of physiological and pathological processes requiring extracellular matrix degradation for cell migration 2,3, notably macrophage recruitment during the inflammatory response 4, as well as tissue remodeling 5, wound healing 6,7, tumor cell invasion and metastasis 8 and skeletal myogenesis 9, neurite outgrowth 10 and apoptosis 11. Furthermore, localization of plasminogen on the cell surface is required to facilitate macrophage recruitment in vivo 12. However, the specific molecules that account for the increased plasminogen binding capacity of the cells following differentiation to macrophages have not been elucidated.",
                        "Proteins exposing carboxyl-terminal lysines on cell surfaces are responsible for the ability of eukaryotic cells to bind plasminogen and enhance plasminogen activation because carboxypeptidase B (CpB) only partially reduces the plasminogen binding capacity of cells but completely blocks the cell-dependent stimulation of plasminogen activation 13. Thus, a specific subset of plasminogen binding sites, with carboxyl terminal lysines, is entirely responsible for the ability of cells to promote plasminogen activation. [These binding sites also interact with tissue plasminogen activator 14, lipoprotein(a) 15 and plasminogen fragments such as angiostatin 1.] Also in vivo results show that CpB-sensitive plasminogen receptors mediate monocyte recruitment in response to inflammatory stimuli 12. Therefore, the ideal candidate for a plasmin(ogen) receptor is an integral membrane protein that exposes a carboxyl terminal lysine on the cell surface. Such a protein has not been identified, to our knowledge.",
                        "A number of cell surface proteins with carboxyl terminal lysines have been identified as plasminogen binding proteins on cell surfaces of a variety of cell types 16. However, most proteins that have been identified do not have signal sequences and are known to be expressed intracellularly. No integral membrane protein with a carboxyl terminal lysine has been identified as a plasminogen receptor. A major difficulty in the field is that isolation and charcterizations have been performed using SDS gels that are not ideal for resolution of integral membrane proteins.",
                        "Therefore, in order to search for an integral membrane protein with a carboxyl terminal lysine we employed a novel purification procedure followed by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). Intact cells were biotinylated and then either untreated or treated with CpB (to remove carboxyl terminal lysines). Then membrane fractions were prepared and isolated by affinity chromatography on plasminogen-Sepharose. The proteins that bound specifically to plasminogen-Sepharose were then captured on avidin-Sepharose, digested with trypsin and subjected to multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). (Proteins that were not detected following treatment of intact cells with CpB were plasminogen binding proteins exposing C-terminal basic residues on the cell surface.) We identified a novel protein, C9orf46 homolog, that is predicted to be a Type II transmembrane protein that exposes a carboxyl terminal lysine on the cell surface, the first such candidate plasminogen receptor with this structure. We named the protein Plg-RKT, to refer to murine, human and all other orthologs. Furthermore, Plg-RKT expression was markedly upregulated when progenitor monocytes were differentiated with macrophage colony stimulating factor.",
                        "Our identification of peptides corresponding to Plg-RKT is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the existence of a protein encoded by the C9orf46 homolog gene present in the murine genome. The C9orf46 homolog DNA sequence encodes a protein of 147 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 17,261 Da. Notably, a carboxyl terminal lysine is present, consistent with the CpB sensitivity of this protein (on intact cells) in our isolation method and consistent with Plg-RKT as a candidate profibrinolytic plasminogen receptor. The Plg-RKT sequence is predicted to be a Type II (multipass) transmembrane protein with two predicted transmembrane domains from F53-L73 and P78-Y99. Hence, a 27 amino acid carboxyl terminal tail with a carboxyl terminal lysine is predicted to be exposed on the cell surface, again, consistent with our identification method, and placing the carboxyl terminal lysine in an orientation to bind plasminogen on the cell surface. We blasted the C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT sequence against all species using NCBI Blast and obtained unique human, rat, dog and cow orthologs, with high homology (e.g. human versus mouse=96% homology), high identity and no gaps in the sequence. Of key importance, a C-terminal lysine is predicted for all of the mammalian orthologs obtained in the blast search. In a query of the Ensembl Gene Report, DNA sequences of all other available mammalian orthologs (armadillo, lesser Madagascar hedgehog, rhesus monkey, gray short tailed opossom, domestic rabbit and chimpanzee) encoded C-terminal lysines, supporting functional importance of this residue.",
                        "The C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT transcript is broadly expressed in normal human and mouse tissues, [as determined using high-throughput gene expression profiling in which RNA samples from human and murine tissues were hybridized to high-density gene expression arrays 17,18] including spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, intestine, bone marrow, as well as endocrine tissue, adrenal, pituitary vascular tissue, kidney, liver, stomach, bladder, and neuronal tissue (hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and dorsal root ganglion).",
                        "We searched for C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT mRNA microarray expression data at http.www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/aew/. 9orf46 homolog mRNA is present in monocytes, leukocytes, NK cells, T cells, myeloid, dendritic, and plasmacytoid cells, breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Molt-4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. These data are consistent with previous reports documenting expression of plasminogen binding sites on peripheral blood leukocytes 19, breast cancer cells 8,20 and other tissues [reviewed in 16]. In addition, results obtained by searching the ArrayExpress Warehouse (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray) indicated that the C9orf46 homolog gene is also regulated in other tissues by lipopolysaccharide, aldosterone, canrenoate, H2O2, and dexaamethasone. The broad distribution and regulation in tissues that express plasminogen binding sites, suggest that Plg-RKT provides plasminogen receptor function that may serve to modulate plasmin proteolytic functions in these tissues, as well. In genome-scale quantitative image analysis, overexpression of more than 86 cDNAs, including C9orf46 homolog, conferred dramatic increases in cell proliferation, while knockdown of C9orf46 homolog mRNA resulted in apoptosis 21. In microarray studies, C9orf46 homolog mRNA expression has a high power to predict cervical lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma",
                        "It is likely that Plg-RKT has not been identified previously because, being a membrane protein, it did not resolve well in SDS gel electrophoresis, the technique that has been used predominantly in the plasminogen receptor field for protein discovery. Furthermore, Plg-RKT represents the first plasminogen-binding protein that is a Type II membrane protein with a carboxyl terminal lysine on the extracellular face of the membrane in an orientation available to interact with plasminogen and in a location that can serve to localize plasminogen and plasmin to the cell surface."

However, other methods well known in the art for preparing conjugates can also be used. Exemplary additional linking procedures include the use of Michael addition reaction products, di-aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, Klipstein, et al., J. Infect. Dis., 147:318-326 (1983) and the like, or the use of carbodiimide technology as in the use of a water-soluble carbodiimide to form amide links to the carrier. For a review of protein conjugation or coupling through activated functional groups, see Aurameas, et al., Scand. J. Immunol., 1:7-23 (1978). Alternatively, the heterobifunctional cross-linker SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate)) can be used to conjugate peptides, in which a carboxy-terminal cysteine has been introduced.",

Inocula typically contain polypeptide concentrations of about 10 micrograms to about 500 milligrams per inoculation (dose), preferably about 50 micrograms to about 50 milligrams per dose.",

The specifications for the novel unit dose of an inoculum of this invention are dictated by and are directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular immunologic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such active material for immunologic use in animals, as disclosed in detail herein, these being features of the present invention.",

In addition, a site directed coupling reaction can be carried out so that any loss of activity due to polypeptide orientation after coupling can be minimized See, for example, Rodwell et al., Biotech., 3:889-894 (1985), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,958.",

A monoclonal antibody thus typically displays a single binding affinity for any epitope with which it immunoreacts. A monoclonal antibody may therefore contain an antibody molecule having a plurality of antibody combining sites, each immunospecific for a different epitope, e.g., a bispecific monoclonal antibody.",

The preparation of such antibodies was first described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975), which description is incorporated by reference. The hybridoma supernates so prepared can be screened for the presence of antibody molecules that immunoreact with a Plg-RKT polypeptide, or for inhibition of the binding of plasminogen, plasminogen fragments, tissue plasminogen activator or lipoprotein(a) to Plg-RKT as described further herein.",

The polypeptide-induced hybridoma technology is described by Niman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 80:4949-4953 (1983), which description is incorporated herein by reference.",

In such cases where the principal indicating group is an enzyme such as HRP or glucose oxidase, additional reagents are required to visualize the fact that a receptor-ligand complex (immunoreactant) has formed. Such additional reagents for HRP include hydrogen peroxide and an oxidation dye precursor such as diaminobenzidine. An additional reagent useful with glucose oxidase is 2,2\u2032-amino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-G-sulfonic acid) (ABTS).",

An exemplary radiolabeling agent is a radioactive element that produces gamma ray emissions. Elements which themselves emit gamma rays, such as 124I, 125I, 128I, 132I and 51Cr represent one class of gamma ray emission-producing radioactive element indicating groups. Particularly preferred is 125I. Another group of useful labeling means are those elements such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N which themselves emit positrons. The positrons so emitted produce gamma rays upon encounters with electrons present in the animal's body. Also useful is a beta emitter, such 111 indium of 3H.",

A \u201cspecific binding agent\u201d is a molecular entity capable of selectively binding a reagent species of the present invention or a complex containing such a species, but is not itself a polypeptide or antibody molecule composition of the present invention. Exemplary specific binding agents are second antibody molecules, complement proteins or fragments thereof, S. aureus protein A, and the like. Preferably the specific binding agent binds the reagent species when that species is present as part of a complex.",

However, when the diagnostic system includes a specific binding agent that is not labeled, the agent is typically used as an amplifying means or reagent. In these embodiments, the labeled specific binding agent is capable of specifically binding the amplifying means when the amplifying means is bound to a reagent species-containing complex.",

Detection of the expression of tumor markers, such as, for example, that of Plg-RKT expression in the enriched cells, can be employed directly as tumor marker. In staging investigations it is possible to correlate the number of detected disseminated tumor cells with the clinical picture, and establish an individual tumor staging. After removal of the primary tumor, the patient can undergo regular checks for recurrence and be immediately treated if there is a positive finding. Further possible uses are the detection of residual tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients who must undergo high-dose radiotherapy, or of disseminated tumor cells within the framework of new therapeutic approaches, and ex vivo and in vivo gene therapeutic approaches.",

Because Plg-RKT expression is observed on breast cancer and other lymphoid cancers, for example, increased expression of Plg-RKT should reflect increased risk for metastasis in a patient. Detection of the expression of tumor markers, such as, for example, that of Plg-RKT expression in the enriched cells, can be employed directly as tumor marker. In staging investigations it is possible to correlate the number of detected disseminated tumor cells with the clinical picture, and establish an individual tumor staging. After removal of the primary tumor, the patient can undergo regular checks for recurrence and be immediately treated if there is a positive finding. Further possible uses are the detection of residual tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients who must undergo high-dose radiotherapy, or of disseminated tumor cells within the framework of new therapeutic approaches, and ex vivo and in vivo gene therapeutic approaches.",

                        "Progenitor and M-CSF-differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells22 (5\u00d7108) were separately biotinylated, using EZ-Link Biotin-LCPEO-Amine (Pierce). The cells were then subjected to dead cell removal on annexin V-coated magnetic microspheres (Miltenyi) that resulted in a 99% enrichment of viable cells (as determined in FACS analysis with PI and annexin V). Membrane fractions were prepared from the viable cells by dounce homogenization in the presence of Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Palo Alto, Calif.) in Invitrosol (Invitrogen), followed by centrifugation steps as used in our laboratory 23,24 and 3 mg were applied to a 1 ml plasminogen-Sepharose affinity column as described 25. The column was washed in phosphate buffered saline containing 1 X Invitrosol until no protein was detected at 280 nm followed by elution with 0.2 M epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). The eluant from the plasminogen-Sepharose column was incubated with 50 \u03bcl of immobilized avidin for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Proteins bound to the immobilized avidin were resuspended in 5 \u03bcl of Invitrosol and heated at 60\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. Then, 45 \u03bcl 80% acetonitrile were added and the samples were digested by trypsin at 37\u00b0 C. for 18 h. After 24 h, the solvent was evaporated in a speedvac, and peptides were dissolved in 500 of buffer A (95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid).",
                        "The protein digest was subjected to multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) [reviewed in 26]. Peptide mixtures were resolved by strong cation exchange liquid chromatography upstream of reversed phase liquid chromatography 27-30. Eluting peptides were electrosprayed into an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, Calif.). Full MS spectra were recorded over a 400-1600 m/z range, followed by three tandem mass (MS/MS) events sequentially generated in a data-dependent manner on the first, second, and third most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum (at 35% collision energy). Mass spectrometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system (ThermoFinnigan).",
                        "Tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw files, and a binary classifier 31, previously trained on a manually validated data set, was used to remove low quality MS/MS spectra. Remaining spectra were searched against a Mus Musculus protein database containing 50,370 protein sequences downloaded as FASTA-formatted sequences from EBI-IPI (database version 3.23, released on Nov. 2, 2006), and 124 common contaminant proteins, for a total of 66,743 target database sequences 32. To calculate confidence levels and false positive rates, we used a decoy database containing the reverse sequences of the 66,743 proteins appended to the target database, and the SEQUEST algorithm 33 to find the best matching sequences from the combined database.",
                        "SEQUEST searches were done on an Intel Xeon 80-processor cluster running under the Linux operating system. The peptide mass search tolerance was set to 3 Da. No differential modifications were considered. No enzymatic cleavage conditions were imposed on the database search, so the search space included all candidate peptides whose theoretical mass fell within the 3 Da mass tolerance window, despite their tryptic status.",
                        "The validity of peptide/spectrum matches was assessed in DTASelect2 34 using SEQUEST-defined parameters, the cross-correlation score (XCorr) and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCN). The search results were grouped by charge state (+1, +2, and +3) and tryptic status (fully tryptic, half-tryptic, and non-tryptic), resulting in 9 distinct sub-groups. In each one of the sub-groups, the distribution of XCorr and DeltaCN values for direct and decoy database hits was obtained, and the two subsets were separated by quadratic discriminant analysis. Outlier points in the two distributions (for example, matches with very low Xcorr but very high DeltaCN) were discarded. Full separation of the direct and decoy subsets is not generally possible; therefore, the discriminant score was set such that a false positive rate of 5% was determined based on the number of accepted decoy database peptides. This procedure was independently performed on each data subset, resulting in a false positive rate independent of tryptic status or charge state.",
                        "Initially, we probed the membrane proteome of M-CSF-differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells for the presence of a regulated integral membrane plasminogen receptor(s), exposing a C-terminal basic residue on the cell surface. Intact M-CSF-differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells were biotinylated as described above. Initially, using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis we verified that 1) viable cells were effectively biotinylated using anti-biotin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled monoclonal antibodies, 2) specific plasminogen binding by the cells was not decreased when cells were treated with the biotinylating reagent and, 3) that biotinylated cells exhibited the same reduction in plasminogen binding capacity in response to carboxypeptidae B (CpB) as non-biotinylated cells, as criteria that the biotinylated plasminogen receptors were behaving as native plasminogen receptors. The membranes were isolated, subjected to affinity chromatography on plasminogen-Sepharose, digested with trypsin and subjected to MudPIT analysis, as described above. Using this method, only one protein with a predicted transmembrane sequence and a C-terminal basic residue was identified: the hypothetical protein, C9orf46 homolog (IPI00136293), homologous to the protein predicted to be encoded by human chromosome 9, open reading frame 46. Table 2 lists the peptides corresponding to C9orf46 homolog that were obtained when the membrane fraction from M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 cells was subjected to MudPIT. Our isolation of peptides corresponding to C9orf46 homolog is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the existence of this protein. We have designated the protein, Plg-RKT, to indicate a plasminogen receptor with a C-terminal lysine and having a transmembrane domain (see below). No peptides corresponding to C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT were detected when biotinylated membrane fractions from undifferentiated progenitor Hoxa9-ER4 cells were subjected to the same purification method, suggesting that membrane expression of Plg-RKT was markedly upregulated by M-CSF treatment.",
                        "The C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT DNA sequence encodes a protein of 147 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 17,261 Da. The murine sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:1. Notably, a carboxyl-terminal lysine is encoded. Correspondingly, when intact M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 cells were incubated with CpB prior to subcellular fractionation and purification, no peptides corresponding to C9orf46 homolog were detected. These data are consistent with exposure of the C-terminal lysine of Plg-RKT on the cell surface and, hence, accessibility to CpB 23,24 so that carboxypeptidase B treatment of intact cells resulted in loss of the ability of Plg-RKT to bind to the plasminogen-Sepharose column.",
                        "(Plasminogen binding to carboxyl terminal lysines on the cell surface is an important concept for understanding the identification of Plg-RKT. The binding of plasminogen to cell surface proteins occurs via binding sites exposing carboxyl terminal lysines to the extracellular environment. Cell surface proteins with carboxyl terminal lysines that are masked or in other inaccessible orientations on the cell surface, or membrane-associated proteins with carboxyl terminal lysines that are located in the inner face of the membrane, cannot serve as plasminogen receptors. Carboxypeptidase B treatment of intact cells removes carboxyl terminal lysines from plasminogen receptors, and plasminogen binding to the cell surface is reduced.)",
                        "2. Amino Acid Sequence of Plg-RKT",
                        "We blasted the C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT sequence against all species using NCBI Blast and obtained unique human, rat, dog and cow orthologs, with high homology (e.g. human versus mouse=96% homology), high identity and no gaps in the sequence Tables 3 and 4). Of key importance, a carboxyl-terminal lysine is predicted for all of the mammalian orthologs obtained in the blast search (Table 4). In a query of the Ensembl Gene Report, DNA sequences of all other available mammalian orthologs (armadillo, lesser Madagascar hedgehog, rhesus monkey, gray short tailed opossom, domestic rabbit and chimpanzee) encoded carboxyl-terminal lysines, supporting functional importance of this residue.",
                        "3. Cell and Tissue Distribution of Plg-RKT",
                        "The C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT transcript is broadly expressed in normal human and mouse tissues, [as determined using high-throughput gene expression profiling in which RNA samples from human and murine tissues were hybridized to high-density gene expression arrays 17,18] including spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, intestine, bone marrow, as well as endocrine tissue, adrenal, pituitary vascular tissue, kidney, liver, stomach, bladder, and neuronal tissue (hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and dorsal root ganglion). In western blotting, we detected Plg-RKT in rat hippocampal neurons, bovine and mouse adrenal tissue and in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in addition to expression in differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells in the current study.",
                        "We searched for C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT mRNA microarray expression data at http.www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/aew/. C9orf46 homolog mRNA is present in monocytes, leukocytes, NK cells, T cells, myeloid, dendritic, and plasmacytoid cells, breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Molt-4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. These data are consistent with previous reports documenting expression of plasminogen binding sites on peripheral blood leukocytes 19, breast cancer cells 8,20 and other tissues [reviewed in 16]. In addition, results obtained by searching the ArrayExpress Warehouse (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray) indicated that the C9orf46 homolog gene is also regulated in other tissues by lipopolysaccharide, aldosterone, canrenoate, H2O2, and dexaamethasone. The broad distribution and regulation in tissues that express plasminogen binding sites, suggest that C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT provides plasminogen receptor function that may serve to modulate plasmin proteolytic functions in these tissues, as well. In genome-scale quantitative image analysis, overexpression of more than 86 cDNAs, including C9orf46 homolog, conferred dramatic increases in cell proliferation, while knockdown of C9orf46 homolog mRNA resulted in apoptosis 21. In microarray studies, C9orf46 homolog mRNA expression has a high power to predict cervical lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma 35.",

                        "Our isolation method was consistent with exposure of the carboxyl-terminus of Plg-RKT (with its carboxyl-terminal lysine) on the cell surface and also with the ability of the carboxyl-terminal domain to bind to plasminogen. For verification, we tested whether a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the C-terminus of Plg-RKT could bind plasminogen. The peptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33) corresponding to the ten C-terminal amino acids of Plg-RKT with cysteine substituted for R138) was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then coated onto wells of microtiter plates at 10 \u03bcg/ml. The wells were blocked with 5% BSA. Plasminogen (0.2 \u03bcM) was incubated with the wells, followed by our anti-plasminogen MAb 36 and detection with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Biosource, Camarillo, Calif.). Plasminogen bound to the peptide in a concentration dependent manner with 50% maximal binding achieved at a plasminogen concentration of \u02dc10 nM. The binding was specific because it was blocked in the presence of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), consistent with the ability of EACA to inhibit plasminogen binding to differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells. In additional controls, nonspecific binding to either BSA, or to the reverse peptide, KDSFLKSQEC (SEQ ID NO: 32), was <10% of binding to CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33). In controls for the detection method, O.D.490 values obtained using an isotype control antibody or in the absence of added plasminogen were <5% of the values for plasminogen binding to the BSA-coupled peptide detected with anti-plasminogen MAb.",

                        "We raised an antiserum in rabbits against the synthetic peptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33). Membrane and cytoplasmic fractions from either untreated Hoxa9-ER4 cells or M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 cells (30 \u03bcg/lane) were electrophoresed and western blotted with either anti-peptide antiserum or preimmune serum. A specific immunoreactive band migrating with an Mrapp of \u02dc17,000 was detected by the antiserum in membranes from M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 cells. The band was not detected in membrane fractions from undifferentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells or in cytoplasmic fractions from either undifferentiated or M-CSF-differentiated cells. The band was not detected in western blotting with pre-immune serum. These data further support the M-CSF-responsiveness and membrane localization of Plg-RKT.",
                        "6. Partitioning Partitions to the Detergent Phase",
                        "To experimentally test the prediction that Plg-RKT is an integral membrane protein, M-CSF-differentiated Hoxa9ER-4 cells were subjected to phase separation in Triton X-114 as described 37,38. In this technique, integral membrane proteins form mixed micelles with the nonionic detergent, and are recovered in the Triton X-114 detergent phase, whereas hydrophilic proteins remain in the aqueous phase. M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 cell membranes were solubilized in 3% Triton X-114. After heating at 37\u00b0 C. and separation of the phases by centrifugation, an aliquot of both phases was electrophoresed and western blotted with anti-CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33). antiserum. An immunoreactive band migrating with a Mrapp of \u02dc17,000, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of C9orf46 homolog/Plg-RKT was detected in the detergent phase, but was not detected in the aqueous phase, consistent with Plg-RKT being an integral membrane protein. In controls for the method, when the cell lysates were spiked with BSA and subjected to phase partitioning, BSA was detected in the aqueous, but not the detergent phase.",

                        "We raised a monoclonal antibody in rats against the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33). Hybridomas were selected by the ability to bind directly to the same peptide coated on wells of microtiter plates, but not with the reverse peptide, KDSFLKSQEC (SEQ ID NO: 32). Hybridomas were further screened and selected for the ability to inhibit plasminogen binding to the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33) and for the ability to react with a protein migrating at \u02dc17 kDA in western blotting of M-CSF-treated Hoxa9-ER4 membranes. We identified several highly reactive hybridoma supernatants, and one of these, was subsequently cloned and developed as anti-Plg-RKT Mab36Al2. Microtiter wells were coated with the Plg-RKT carboxyl-terminal peptide CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33) coupled to BSA at 10 \u03bcg/ml. The wells were blocked with 5% BSA. Increasing concentrations of Mab36Al2 or isotype control were added to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 22\u00b0 C. Bound antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti rat IgG. Mab36Al2 bound to the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33) in a dose-dependent fashion and binding of the isotype control was not detected.",
                        "In addition Mab36Al2 inhibited plasminogen binding to the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33). Mab36Al2 or control rat IgG2A was incubated with the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33), coupled to BSA and immobilized on microtiter wells. In these assays, 200 nM biotinylated plasminogen was then added and plasminogen binding was detected with streptavidin-HRP. [Plasminogen directly bound to the peptide in a concentration-dependent manner and in controls for specificity, biotinylated-Plg binding was competed by unlabeled Plg and no biotinylated-Plg binding to the reverse peptide was detected.) Mab36Al2 fully inhibited plasminogen binding to the Plg-RKT polypeptide, CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33), with an IC50 of 20 nM.",

In the presence of 20 \u03bcg/ml of the monoclonal antibody, Mab36Al2, plasminogen activation was decreased by 30%, relative to the isotype control.",

                        "We tested the ability of a peptide, CEQSRFFIDK (SEQ ID NO: 34), corresponding to the C terminus of human Plg-RKT (residues 139-147), to inhibit the binding of biotinylated-plasminogen to the C-terminal peptide CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33), of mouse Plg-RKT when CEQSKLFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 33), was coupled to BSA and immobilized to microtiter plates as described above. Plasminogen binding to the immobilized C-terminal peptide of Plg-RKT was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the peptide, CEQSRFFIDK (SEQ ID NO: 34), (IC50=1 \u03bcM), but was not affected by a mutant peptide with the C-terminal K replaced with A, CEQSRFFIDA (SEQ ID NO: 35). Thus, the interaction of plasminogen with the C-terminal peptide of Plg-RKT requires the presence of a C-terminal lysine residue. In addition, a peptide with R142 replaced with K CEQSRFFIDK (SEQ ID NO: 34), was a more effective competitor of biotinylated-plasminogen binding than the wild type peptide.",

Plasminogen was directly biotinylated and then incubated with the immobilized peptide and detected with streptavidin-HRP, as above. (Plasminogen bound to the peptide in a concentration-dependent manner. In controls for specificity, biotinylated-Plg binding was competed by unlabeled Plg and no biotinylated-Plg binding to the reverse peptide was detected.)

For this experiment, a core from a case of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (Female 47: T3N3aMO: IIIC) from the Imgenex tissue array IMG-MH-364 was stained with MAb 7H1 using paraffin immunocytochemistry as described 40. Staining was very high in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma tissue and was minimal in the normal adjacent tissue from this core. Correspondingly, minimal antibody staining was detected in normal breast ducts and lobules from a 60-year-old female control subject. In specificity control in which MAb 7H1 was absorbed with the Plg-RKT peptide used for immunization, [CEQSKFFSDK (SEQ ID NO: 36]), staining was not detectable.
