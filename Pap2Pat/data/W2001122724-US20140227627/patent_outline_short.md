## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce PEGylated quaternary ammonium polysulfone AEM
- describe design rationale for promoting phase separation
- synthesize QA PSf-g-PEGx via three-step process
- characterize morphology of PEGylated membranes using SAXS
- analyze SAXS data using Teubner-Strey bi-continuous model
- measure hydroxide conductivity using four-point probe cyclic voltammetry
- fabricate membrane electrode assemblies and assess fuel cell performance
- attribute increased conductivity and device performance to local heterogeneity
- compare ion exchange capacities of PEGylated and un-PEGylated membranes
- discuss variations of the invention, including alternative backbones and side chains
