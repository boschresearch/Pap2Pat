    "title": "Facilitating hydroxide transport in anion exchange membranes via hydrophilic grafts",
    "date": "2014-01-01",
    "abstract": "Alkaline exchange membranes (AEMs) are a promising class of polyelectrolytes whose alkaline operating environment enables the use of non-precious metal catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells. However, their poor ionic conductivities, which are often an order of magnitude lower than traditional acidic membranes (e.g., Nafion), have limited their practicality. The performance problem can partially be ascribed to the poorly-defined morphologies of typical random copolymer AEMs, leading to tortuous ion transport pathways. Here, we show the ability to form nanoscale (5 to 10 nm diameter) anion transport channels by grafting hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) side-chains along a model benzyltrimethylammonium polysulfone-based AEM. Concomitant with the structure formation is a 100% increase in the IEC-normalized hydroxide conductivity from 20.2 mS g cm\u22121 mmol\u22121 to 40.3 mS g cm\u22121 mmol\u22121 as well as a 50% increase in the peak power density from 118 mW cm\u22122 to 180 mW cm\u22122 when incorporated into a fuel cell.",

                "Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have been gaining scienti\ue103c and commercial traction over the past several years owing to their promise of clean energy and high scalability. The most prominent devices employ proton exchange membranes (PEMs) operating under low pH conditions; however, this corrosive, acidic environment necessitates the use of platinumgroup catalysts, severely limiting commercial feasibility. A potential solution is to use an anion exchange membrane (AEM) that transports hydroxide ions instead of protons, thereby creating an alkaline operating environment in which earthabundant catalysts, such as nickel and manganese derivatives, exhibit suitable activity and stability. 1,2 Although AEM technology has improved immensely in the past decade, AEM fuel cells continue to perform unfavorably compared to their PEM counterparts. The performance gap can be partially attributed to the lower ionic conductivities of AEMs, whose typical literature-reported values are o\ue09den an order of magnitude lower than Na\ue103on, the de facto standard PEM. 3,4 Given the high performance of acidic proton exchange membranes (PEM), it is no surprise that their structure and chemistry have heavily in\ue104uenced AEM design. As in PEMs, the general motif for synthesizing AEMs has been to attach pendant ionic salts along a robust hydrophobic polymer backbone. This approach typically manifests as aryl-or benzyl-substituted cations along an aromatic polymer chain. Whereas sulfonate is the pendant counter-anion of choice for PEMs, the pendant counter-cation in AEMs has been more varied, with the aim of improving hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability. Recent approaches have involved membranes based on quaternary ammonium, [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] imidazolium, 12 guanidinium, 13 triazole, 14 phosphonium 15 and sulfonium cations, 16 amongst others. Quaternary ammonium based on trimethylamine is by far the most widely studied of these pendant cation groups and has been introduced on an assortment of different polyaromatic backbones, including polysulfone, [5][6][7][8] poly(phenylene oxide) 9,10 and polyetheretherketone. 11 However, in these systems, the close proximity of the pendant cation to the rigid polymer backbone inhibits the formation of strongly segregated hydrophilic-hydrophobic domains. 17,18 Consequently, these membranes are o\ue09den characterized by poorly de\ue103ned water-rich phases, leading to ion transport occurring in highly constricted and tortuous pathways. A natural approach for improving AEM performance, then, is to design ionomers with better-de\ue103ned ion transport domains 19,20 by promoting strong microphase separation between the pendant counterion and the polymer backbone. Indeed, several groups have recently implemented this concept by introducing linear spacers either between the backbone and the counterion (a la Na\ue103on) 21 or as a side-chain of the counterion. 9,22 Another avenue for modi\ue103cation is to gra\ue09d side-chains along the same backbone as the pendant counterion. A recent study by Pan et al. 23 showed that gra\ue09ding alkyl chains along a model AEM polymer material facilitated clustering of the hydrophobic species, resulting in a interstitial water-rich ion transport \"highway\". In this work, we show that structure formation in these random gra\ue09d copolymer systems can be achieved through a different mechanism. Speci\ue103cally, we show that introducing \ue104exible, hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gra\ue09ds along a typical pendant counterion-hydrophobic polyaromatic backbone ionomer can induce local phase separation and leads to enhanced hydroxide conductivity.",
                "The synthetic approach we adopt is applicable to several AEMs previously reported in the literature. As a model system, we gra\ue09ded PEG moieties along the highly-studied benzyltrimethylammonium-functionalized polysulfone (QA PSf) AEM to yield quaternary ammonium polysulfone-gra\ue09d-poly(ethylene glycol) (QA PSf-g-PEGx) (Scheme 1). The design rationale for promoting phase separation is two-fold. First, the hydrophilic PEG gra\ue09d has a repulsive c interaction parameter with the hydrophobic polysulfone backbone and favorable interaction with water (highlighted by its reported use as a PEM humidifying agent 24 ). Moreover, PEG's electron-rich ether groups have been shown to complex with cationic quaternary ammonium salts 25,26 and are expected to interact favorably with the pendant benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) species along the polysulfone backbone. The culmination of these effects leads to colocalization and concentration of the quaternary ammonium groups into efficient, water-rich hydroxide transport domains, resulting in increased ionic conductivity."

The values of these length scales derived from the TS \ue103t are listed in Table 1. The scattering data can be rationalized by the chain architecture for both QA PSf-g-PEG350 and QA PSf-g-PEG750. The larger domain size for QA PSf-g-PEG750 is ascribed to the longer contour length of the higher molecular weight PEG750 (5.8 nm) compared to PEG350 (2.8 nm). Water uptake in these hydrophilic channels results in swelling and domain sizes exceeding the contour length of the PEG gra\ue09ds. An illustration of our morphological interpretation of the SAXS data is provided in Fig. 2b. The weaker domain correlation (as manifest in the lower x) of QA PSf-g-PEG750 can be explained by its lower PEG gra\ue09ding density, which is roughly half that of QA PSf-g-PEG350 given the same PEG weight composition in the two systems. The larger average spacing between the PEG chains coupled with their random placement leads to decreased gra\ue09ding regularity and diminished long-range interactions. This effect is again evidenced in the polydispersity of the domain sizes, as re\ue104ected by the x/d ratio, where a lower value corresponds to higher polydispersity. The ratio for QA PSf-g-PEG750 (0.20) is two-thirds of that for QA PSf-g-PEG350 (0.31), suggesting a broader distribution of hydrophilic domain sizes. In summary, PEGylation of QA PSf gives rise to a broad scattering feature analogous to that of a bi-continuous microemulsion; this scattering is attributed to microphase separation of hydrophilic, PEG-rich ionomer channels from the hydrophobic polysulfone matrix. Given the same weight composition, QA PSf-g-PEG350 has narrower, but less disperse domain sizes compared to QA PSf-g-PEG750.",

                "The close conformity between the empirical scattering data and the Alexander-de Gennes scaling theory suggests that the PEG side-chains adopt a brush-like conformation in the ionomer channels.

                "Hydroxide conductivity is a critical performance metric for AEMs. The hydroxide conductivity of un-PEGylated QA PSf was 40.0 mS cm \u00c01 at 60 C, consistent with previously reported data in the literature. 36 The introduction of 12% w/w PEG350 and PEG750 gra\ue09ds increased the conductivity to 48.2 mS cm \u00c01 and 63.2 mS cm \u00c01 , respectively. The temperature dependence of the hydroxide conductivities followed an Arrhenius trend (Fig. 4). Concomitant with the higher hydroxide conductivity was a decrease in the apparent Arrhenius activation energy, from 17.5 kJ mol \u00c01 (QA PSf) to 15 kJ mol \u00c01 (QA PSf-g-PEG350) and 11.2 kJ mol \u00c01 (QA PSf-g-PEG750). The enhanced performance with PEGylation supports the notion that a microphase-separated structure is bene\ue103cial to ion transport.",
                "The structural in\ue104uence on the enhanced performance is underscored by comparing the ion exchange capacities (IEC) of the materials (Table 1). Of particular interest is that the PEGylated membranes have lower IECs than QA PSf. While a decrease in IEC typically manifests in decreased ionic conductivity as a result of lower charge content, both QA PSf-g-PEG350 and QA PSf-g-PEG750 show increased performance. Hydroxide conductivity normalized by the IEC has been used as a qualitative metric for assessing ion transport efficacy 16,37,38 and is presented in Table 1. PEGylation increases the IEC normalized conductivity by 81% and 100% for QA PSf-g-PEG350 and QA PSfg-PEG750, respectively, highlighting the in\ue104uence of structure formation on ion transport properties.

Generally, under moderate water uptake conditions (e.g., barring notable dilution of ion concentration, mechanical degradation of the membrane, etc.), ionic conductivity scales directly with water content. 3 Table 2 presents the water uptake data for the prepared membranes.",
                "Despite the presence of hydrophilic PEG gra\ue09ds, the PEGylated membranes nonetheless exhibit lower water uptake compared to bare QA PSf due to their signi\ue103cantly lower IECs. That the in\ue104uence of ion concentration on water uptake outweighs that of PEG incorporation is unsurprising given that the ion-dipole interaction associated with quaternary ammonium cation solvation is stronger than the hydrogen-bonding interaction involved in PEG hydration. This effect is evident in the hydration numbers of their small molecule analogs. The tetramethylammonium cation has been calculated to have a hydration number of approximately 23; 39 in comparison, PEG is estimated to contain a maximum of one bound water molecule per ethylene oxide repeat unit via hydrogen bonding at the ether position. 40 The l parameter denotes the average number of water molecules per pendant BTMA group. Whereas bare QA PSf has l \u00bc 41, QA PSf-g-PEG350 and QA PSf-g-PEG750 have l \u00bc 33 and 34, respectively. Juxtaposing the l values for the different samples against their conductivities, it becomes clear that PEGylation yields higher conductivities at lower water content. This effect is highlighted by the l-normalized conductivities, where QA PSf-g-PEG350 and QA PSf-g-PEG750 show 77% and 133% improvements over QA PSf. This increase in efficiency again corroborates the idea that PEGylation-induced structure formation is facilitating hydroxide transport."

                "Quaternary ammonium polysulfone AEMs are known to have questionable alkaline stability. It is well established that the benzyltrimethylammonium cations in these AEMs are subject to nucleophilic attack by hydroxide anions, resulting in decreases in ion concentration and conductivity. 41 Moreover, Arges et al. have shown that the polysulfone backbone, otherwise stable at high pH, becomes vulnerable to hydrolytic cleavage upon quaternary ammonium functionalization, leading to embrittlement and mechanical degradation. 42 In practice, the extent and rate of degradation is subject to environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, etc.) and chemical makeup (e.g., gra\ue09ding degree, IEC, etc.). Here we aim to assess the effects, if any, that PEGylation may have on alkaline stability, again using QA PSf as a baseline for comparison. Speci\ue103cally, we exposed all three membranes to accelerated degradation conditions (1 M and 6 M KOH solutions at 60 C) and monitored changes in both the mass (Fig. 5a) and ionic conductivity (Fig. 5b) over time.",
                "Exposure to extremely caustic conditions (6 M KOH) resulted in the rapid degradation of all membranes. The signi\ue103cant mass loss (>20%) for all samples a\ue09der 24 hours of exposure is attributed primarily to the degradation of the quaternary ammonium-functionalized polysulfone backbone. This effect was manifest physically in the embrittlement and discoloration (yellowing) of the samples. Ultimately, all samples shattered into several pieces a\ue09der removal from the conductivity cell at the 24 hour mark. It has been suggested that the primary mechanism for quaternary ammonium polysulfone backbone degradation under these conditions is hydrolytic cleavage of the ether bond which is weakened by the electron withdrawing  effects of the quaternary ammonium and sulfone functionalities. 42 Hence, a priori we had expected that the PEG gra\ue09d would stabilize this ether bond via the electron donating potential of the PEG ether oxygen. However, the rapid degradation for all samples indicates that PEGylation had minimal effect on the mechanical robustness of the samples under these accelerated conditions. Similarly, the conductivity of all samples dropped precipitously (>40%) within 24 hours attributed to a combination of severe mechanical degradation (via attack on the polysulfone backbone) and decrease in ion concentration (via attack on the quaternary ammonium cation).",
                "Testing under mild alkaline conditions (1 M KOH) revealed slight stability differences between QA PSf and QA PSf-g-PEGx.",
                "Whereas QA PSf lost nearly a quarter of its mass and became brittle over a 5 day period, the PEGylated membranes retained 85-90% of their initial mass and remained \ue104exible, suggesting improved backbone stability. Although differences in cation stability, as inferred by the conductivity drop, were notable a\ue09der a 5 day exposure period (e.g., 12% retained conductivity for QA PSf vs. 29% for QA PSf-g-PEG350), they were nonetheless pragmatically insufficient given that all membranes lost more than 70% of their initial conductivity. We note that the degradation rate of the membranes were directly related to their IECs, with QA PSf-g-PEG350 showing the highest stability with an initial IEC of 1.36 mmol OH \u00c0 g \u00c01 and QA PSf showing the lowest stability with an initial IEC of 1.98 mmol OH \u00c0 g \u00c01 . As such, the moderate stability improvement of the PEGylated membranes under these conditions is likely due to their lower charge concentrations (i.e., IEC).",
                "Ultimately, our data suggests that the PEG gra\ue09ds had marginal in\ue104uence on overall alkaline stability. While the PEG side-chains do not accelerate the degradation of the membranes, they nevertheless do not resolve the inherent robustness issues associated with both the polysulfone backbone and the benzyltrimethylammonium cation. As noted previously, while we used QA PSf as a platform for testing our design strategy, the synthesis is inherently adaptable to other aromatic backbones and cationic functional groups. Thus, using a more stable backbone (e.g., poly(phenylene oxide) 43 ) and/or cation (e.g., phosphonium 37 or sulfonium 16 ) may yield more practical materials."

Co-localization and concentration of the ion conducting quaternary ammonium moieties as a result of this phase separation results in the formation of a percolating, water-rich anion transport phase, leading to more efficient hydroxide transport as demonstrated by increased in-plane conductivity and device performance.",
                "A scaling analysis suggests that the local, nanoscale structure is characterized by a brush-like conformation of the poly(ethylene glycol) gra\ue09ds; this architecture is rationalized by the thermodynamic propensity of the hydrophilic sidechains to repel themselves from the hydrophobic backbone and extend into water-rich regions upon hydration. Energetic frustrations arising from the random gra\ue09ding of the sidechains result in a lack of structures at length-scales greater than that of the nanometer-sized domains. Consequently, as demonstrated by a close agreement of the SAXS data with the Teubner-Strey model, the mesoscale morphology is characterized by a percolating network of these nanoscale anion transport domains within a continuous hydrophobic matrix.",
                "We chose benzyltrimethylammonium polysulfone as a model system for our study due to the availability of several literature sources against which we could benchmark and verify our data. However, we believe the same thermodynamic considerations and design rationale can be applied to similar polyaromatic backbones (e.g., polyphenylsulfone) as well as to other ion exchange groups (e.g., imidazolium). Moreover, because the PEGylation chemistry shares the same alkyl halide reactive site that is commonly used to quaternize tertiary amines, the synthesis is inherently adaptable to several polyaromatic systems reported in the literature. Ultimately, we hope that this gra\ue09ding approach offers new design considerations for future polyelectrolyte membranes."
