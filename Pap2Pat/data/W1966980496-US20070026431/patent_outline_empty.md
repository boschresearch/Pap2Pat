## DEFINITIONS

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### FBXW8 Protein (F-BOX WD-40 Domain Protein 8)

### MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase)

### CULLIN 1 (CUL1)

### Cullin 7 (CUL7)

### SKP1 (S-Phase Kinase-associated Protein 1)

### Cyclin D1

### Nucleic Acid Molecules, Polypeptide Production Methods, Expression Vectors, Fusion Proteins

### Covalently Modified Proteins

### Components for Polyubitquitination Assays

## EXAMPLES

### Cyclin D1 Protein is Destabilized Specifically in S Phase in Cancer Cells

### Cyclin D1 Protein is Degraded During the S Phase Through the Ubiquitin-proteasome Pathway in Cancer Cells

### Expression of Cyclin D1 Protein in the Nucleus Decreases Through the G1-S Transition in Tumor Cells

### Phosphorylation of Cyclin D1 Protein is Mediated by the Same Mechanism as Cyclin D1 Gene Expression, V1A the MAPK Signaling Pathway

### Example 5
