                        "Cyclin D1 plays a key role in regulation of G1 progression of the cell cycle in cancer cells, and is over-expressed in various kinds of cancers. Increased expression of cyclin D1 is achieved by different mechanisms, including chromosomal rearrangements, gene amplifications, and mRNA stabilization. In addition, uterine leiomyosarcomas and endometrial cancers, and breast cancers are reported to have defects in the proteolysis of cyclin D1 protein. These observations have led to increased interest to understand the mechanism that confer increased levels of cyclin D1 in cells.",
                        "Transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 has been extensively studied and is well understood. Various mitogenic signals that activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade, resulting in cyclin D1 synthesis and its assembly with CDK4/6 in the presence or absence of assembly factors p21 Cip1 or p27 Kip1. Cyclin D1 is also a major transcriptional target of the APC/\u03b2-catenin/TCF signaling pathway. Indeed, cancers having mutations either APC or \u03b2-catenin exhibit high levels of cyclin D1 expression. Further confirming the role of cyclin D1 in cancer progression, mice lacking cyclin D1 are resistant to colon cancers induced by hyperactivation of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF signaling pathway.",
                        "Other mechanisms for increasing cyclin D1 in a cell are not as well characterized. Cyclin D1 is polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway, a process that requires phosphorylating cyclin D1 at threonine (Thr)-286, located near its C terminus (Diehl et al. (1997) Genes Dev 1:957-72; Diehl et al. (1997) Mol Cell Biol. 17: 7362-74). Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 promotes its nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution, indicating a role of cyclin D1 phosphorylation in cell cycle regulation. The cyclin D1 mutant T286A is resistant to ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo and is a highly stable protein. However, the cell components responsible for cyclin D1 phosphorylation, and for degradation of phosphorylated cyclin D1, has been an area of continued research and conflicting reports.",
                        "For example, GSK3\u03b2 has been implicated as having a role in cyclin D1 phosphorylation and stability (Diehl et al. (1998) Genes Dev 12: 3499-511; Alt et al. (2000) Genes Dev. 14: 3102-14), but this role was later questioned (Shao et al. (2000) J Biol Chem. 275: 22916-24; Guo et al. (2005) Oncogene 24: 2599-612). Others have reported that p38 SAPK2 is involved in proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 following osmotic shock (Casanovas et al. (2000) J Biol Chem. 275:35091-7). Mitogen signals or Ras activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (P13K) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) kinases, which in turn inhibit activity of GSK3\u03b2. Therefore Ras signals may contribute to stabilization of the cyclin D1 protein. However, in Rat-1 cells, Ras signals have the opposite effect on cyclin D1 protein: they promote cyclin D1 degradation but not stabilization, suggesting that in these cells cyclin D1 turnover is totally independent of GSK3\u03b2.",
                        "While ubiquitin-mediated degradation is a well understood process, the ubiquitin pathway enzymes that mediate degradation of Cyclin D1 were also not understood. In general, polyubiquitin-protein conjugates are formed by shuttling three components that participate in sequential ubiquitin transfer reactions: 1) E1, an activating enzyme, 2) E2/Ubc, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and 3) an E3 protein ligase, which specifically binds to the target protein substrate (Hershko et al. (1998) Annu Rev Biochem. 67:425-79). This process facilitates E2-dependent addition of a multiubiquitin chain to lysine residues in a substrate protein.",
                        "The multicomponent SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate ubiquitination of substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Deshaies (1999) Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 15: 435-67). The SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases are a highly diverse family of complexes named for its components, the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1), Cullin 1 (CUL1/Cdc53), F-box proteins, and RBX1/ROC1 (Cardozo et al. (2004) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 5: 739-51; Jin et al. (2004) Genes Dev. 18: 2573-80). SKP1 is an adaptor subunit and selectively interacts with a scaffold protein CUL1 or CUL7 to promote the ubiquitination of targeted substrates. Association of CUL7 with SKP1 depends on FBXW8 (also known as Fbx29, FBXO29, or Fbw6; Jin et al., 2004) and forms a specific SCF-like complex (Dias et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 99: 16601-6; Arai (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 100: 9855-60). Currently it is thought that CUL1, and perhaps CUL7 as well, are covalently modified by NeddS, a ubiquitin-like molecule involving recruitment of the RTNG-containing protein RJBX1, which in turn recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the SCF, and may also facilitate recruitment of the SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Lammer et al. (1998) Genes Dev. 12: 914-26; Osaka et al. (1998) Genes Dev. 12: 2263-8; Kawakami et al. (2001) EMBO J. 20: 4003-12).",
                        "There is a need for compounds that modulate cellular proliferation, particularly compounds that inhibitor cellular proliferation of cancer cells. Identification of the cellular proteins involved in phosphorylation and/or ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 would provide for interesting targets for modulation of cellular proliferation through modulation of cyclin D1 levels in the cell cytoplasm. The invention is at least in part based on the discovery of these targets."

Interaction can be detected directly (e.g., by detecting binding of FBXW8 and phosphorylated cyclin D1, or binding of cyclin D1 and MAPK) or indirectly by assaying a product of a reaction that occurs as a result of the interaction (e.g., ubiquitinated cyclin D1 as a result of FBXW8 and phosphorylated cyclin D1; phosphorylated cyclin D1 as a result of interaction of MAPK and cyclin D1).",

For example, a cell having a defect in a FBXW8 polypeptide has decreased or no detectable activity in ubiquitination of phosphorylated cyclin D1. In another example, a cell having a defect in a MAPK polypeptide has decreased or no detectable activity in phosphorylation of cyclin D1. The defect in the polypeptide may be due to, for example, decreased expression of a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide, expression of a modified polypeptide (e.g., as in a polypeptide fragment lacking all or a portion of a functional domain required for activity, a polypeptide mutant having reduced or no detectable activity (including dominant negative mutants), and the like). The dominant negative mutant of FBXW8 as described herein is an example of a defective polypeptide.",

Further exemplary test agents are described herein.",

The context of use of the term will make it apparent as to whether increase or decrease in the relevant phenomenon is desired. For example, in the context of inhibiting cellular proliferation (e.g., as in inhibition of growth of cancerous cells) through modulating MAPK phosphorylation of cyclin D1 and/or FBXW8-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin D1, a desired \u201cmodulator\u201d is one that inhibits cellular proliferation by inhibiting MAPK phosphorylation and/or inhibiting FBXW8-mediated cyclin D1 degradation (e.g., by inhibiting cyclin D1 ubiquitination).",

In general, an inhibitory agent generally reduces an activity of interest (e.g., cellular proliferation, an enzymatic activity (e.g., cyclin D1 phosphorylation or ubiquitination), expression of a target gene) by at least 20%, e.g., at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, up to about 99% or 100% in an assay, as compared to the same assay performed in the absence of the compound. In some embodiments, e.g., where inhibition of cellular proliferation using an siNA is involved, inhibition, down-regulation or reduction with an siNA molecule is below that level observed in the absence of the siNA molecule or in the presence of a negative control (e.g., an inactive or attenuated molecule, or an siNA molecule with scrambled sequence and/or mismatches).",

The nucleic acids include genomic DNA, cDNA and oligonucleotides including sense and anti-sense nucleic acids. Also siNAs, such as siRNAs, are included. Such nucleic acids may also contain modifications in the ribose-phosphate backbone to increase stability and half life of such molecules in physiological environments.",
                        "The nucleic acid may be double stranded, single stranded, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the depiction of a single strand (\u201cWatson\u201d) also defines the sequence of the other strand (\u201cCrick\u201d). By the term \u201crecombinant nucleic acid\u201d herein is meant nucleic acid, originally formed in vitro, in general, by the manipulation of nucleic acid by endonucleases, in a form not normally found in nature. Thus an isolated nucleic acid, in a linear form, or an expression vector formed in vitro by ligating DNA molecules that are not normally joined, are both considered recombinant for the purposes of this invention. It is understood that once a recombinant nucleic acid is made and reintroduced into a host cell or organism, it will replicate non-recombinantly, i.e. using the in vivo cellular machinery of the host cell rather than in vitro manipulations; however, such nucleic acids, once produced recombinantly, although subsequently replicated non-recombinantly, are still considered recombinant for the purposes of the invention.",
                        "Nucleic acid sequence identity (as well as amino acid sequence identity) is calculated based on a reference sequence, which may be a subset of a larger sequence, such as a conserved motif, coding region, flanking region, etc. A reference sequence will usually be at least about 18 residues long, more usually at least about 30 residues long, and may extend to the complete sequence that is being compared. Algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art, such as BLAST, described in Altschul et al. (1990), J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10 (using default settings, i.e. parameters w=4 and T=17).",
                        "Where a nucleic acid is said to hybridize to a recited nucleic acid sequence, hybridization is under stringent conditions. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization at 50\u00b0 C. or higher and 0.1\u00d7SSC (15 mM sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Another example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubation at 42\u00b0 C. in a solution: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH7.6), 5\u00d7 Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65\u00b0 C. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as stringent as the above representative conditions, where conditions are considered to be at least as stringent if they are at least about 80% as stringent, typically at least about 90% as stringent as the above specific stringent conditions. Other stringent hybridization conditions are known in the art and may also be employed to identify nucleic acids of this particular embodiment of the invention.",

In general, fragments or variants retain a biological activity of the parent polypeptide from which their sequence is derived (e.g., activity in phosphorylating cyclin D1 where the parent polypeptide is MAPK; activity in ubiquitination of cyclin D1 where the parent polypeptide is FBXW8). It should be noted that, as will be clear from the context, reference to cyclin D1, FBXW8, MAPK, CUL1, CUL7 and SKP1 is intended to refer to cyclin D1 polypeptide, FBXW8 polypeptide, MAPK polypeptide, CUL1 polypeptide, CUL7 polypeptide, and SKP1 polypeptide.",

In general, polypeptides comprising a sequence of a human polypeptide are of particular interest. For example, \u201cHuman FBXW8 polypeptide\u201d refers to the amino acid sequences of isolated human FBXW8 polypeptide obtained from a human, and is meant to include all naturally-occurring allelic variants, and is not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete, native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule.",
                        "A \u201cvariant\u201d of a polypeptide is defined as an amino acid sequence that is altered by one or more amino acids (e.g., by deletion, addition, insertion and/or substitution). Generally, \u201caddition\u201d refers to nucleotide or amino acid residues added to an end of the molecule, while \u201cinsertion\u201d refers to nucleotide or amino acid residues between residues of a naturally-occurring molecule. The variant can have \u201cconservative\u201d changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. More rarely, a variant can have \u201cnonconservative\u201d changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Similar minor variations can also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which and how many amino acid residues may be substituted, added, inserted or deleted without abolishing biological or immunological activity can be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DNAStar software.",

                        "Cyclin D1 degradation is required for cell proliferation, including proliferation of cancer cells. The inventors have demonstrated that the MAPK signaling cascade promotes cyclin D1 phosphorylation at Thr-286 and that MAPK is the major kinase which specifically phosphorylates cyclin D1 at Thr-286. Phosphorylated cyclin D1 is polyubiquitinated and degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway. (for a schematic, see FIG. 1)",
                        "Furthermore, the inventors have demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase which specifically interacts with cyclin D1 contains FBXW8 F-box protein. The FBXW8 F-box protein associates with either CUL1 or CUL7 (referred to herein as \u201cCUL1/CUL7\u201d) and SKP1 to form an SCF-like complex which recognizes cyclin D1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The ubiquitination of cyclin D1 is regulated by the FBXW8-CUL1/CUL7-SKP1 complex. The inventors have further demonstrated that inhibiting activity of FBXW8 F-box protein or either of CUL1 or CUL7 through RNA interference or a dominant-negative mutant causes accumulation of stabilized cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm, which results in the reduction of cancer cell proliferation."

The consensus sequence of an F-box motif is described in Bai et al., 1996, Cell 86:263, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FBXW8 protein interacts with SKP1 and either CUL1 or CUL7 to form an ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to ubiquitinate phosphorylated cyclin D1, which then leads to degradation.",

In one embodiment, the subject FBXW8 protein is made by performing a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total RNA from cells, for example, HEK 293, HCT 116 or WI-38 cells to obtain the FBXW8 F-box protein gene. The retrieved full-length cDNA is then cloned into pFB retrovirus expression vector (Stratagene) and transfected to amphotropic phoenix cells. The supernatant was harvested for 48-72 hrs after transfection, filtered, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Cells were infected with a virus media containing 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene for 4 hours then subsequently replaced with fresh media and cultured for further 48 hours.",

Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.",
                                "Nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. As another example, operably linked refers to DNA sequences linked so as to be contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adapters or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. The transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid will generally be appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein; for example, transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid sequences from Bacillus can be used to express the protein in Bacillus. Numerous types of appropriate expression vectors, and suitable regulatory sequences are known in the art for a variety of host cells.",
                                "In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include, but are not limited to, promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. In one embodiment, the regulatory sequences include a promoter and transcriptional start and stop sequences.",

For example, the expression vector may have two replication systems, thus allowing it to be maintained in two organisms, for example in mammalian or insect cells for expression and in a prokaryotic host for cloning and amplification. Furthermore, for integrating expression vectors, the expression vector contains at least one sequence homologous to the host cell genome, and preferably two homologous sequences which flank the expression construct. The integrating vector may be directed to a specific locus in the host cell by selecting the appropriate homologous sequence for inclusion in the vector. Constructs for integrating vectors are well known in the art.",

The choice of vector will depend on the type of cell in which propagation is desired and the purpose of propagation. Certain vectors are useful for amplifying and making large amounts of the desired DNA sequence. Other vectors are suitable for expression in cells in culture. Still other vectors are suitable for transformation and expression in cells in a whole animal or person. The choice of appropriate vector is well within the skill of the art. Many such vectors are available commercially. To prepare the constructs, the partial or full-length polynucleotide is inserted into a vector typically by means of DNA ligase attachment to a cleaved restriction enzyme site in the vector.",
                                "Alternatively, the desired nucleotide sequence can be inserted by homologous recombination in a cell. Typically this is accomplished by attaching regions of homology to the vector on the flanks of the desired nucleotide sequence. Regions of homology are added by ligation of oligonucleotides, or by polymerase chain reaction using primers comprising both the region of homology and a portion of the desired nucleotide sequence, for example.",

For expression, the gene product encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention is expressed in any convenient expression system, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, insect, amphibian and mammalian systems. In the expression vector, a subject polynucleotide is linked to a regulatory sequence as appropriate to obtain the desired expression properties. These regulatory sequences can include promoters (attached either at the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand or at the 3\u2032 end of the antisense strand), enhancers, terminators, operators, repressors, and inducers. The promoters can be regulated or constitutive.",

Sequences encoding metabolic pathway enzymes provide particularly useful promoter sequences. Examples include promoter sequences derived from sugar metabolizing enzymes, such as galactose, lactose and maltose, and sequences derived from biosynthetic enzymes such as tryptophan. Promoters from bacteriophage may also be used and are known in the art. In addition, synthetic promoters and hybrid promoters are also useful; for example, the tac promoter is a hybrid of the trp and lac promoter sequences.

In E. coli, the ribosome binding site is called the Shine-Delgarno (SD) sequence and includes an initiation codon and a sequence 3-9 nucleotides in length located 3-11 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. Bacterial expression vectors may also include a signal peptide sequence that provides for secretion of the protein in bacteria. The signal sequence typically encodes a signal peptide comprised of hydrophobic amino acids which direct the secretion of the protein from the cell, as is well known in the art. The protein is either secreted into the growth media (gram-positive bacteria) or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell (gram-negative bacteria).",

Mammalian expression systems are also known in the art, and include retroviral systems. A mammalian promoter (i.e., a promoter functional in a mammalian cell) is any DNA sequence capable of binding mammalian RNA polymerase and initiating the downstream (3\u2032) transcription of a coding sequence for a protein into mRNA. A promoter will have a transcription initiating region, which is usually placed proximal to the 5\u2032 end of the coding sequence, and a TATA box, using a located 25-30 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. The TATA box is thought to direct RNA polymerase II to begin RNA synthesis at the correct site. A mammalian promoter will also contain an upstream promoter element (enhancer element), typically located within 100 to 200 base pairs upstream of the TATA box. An upstream promoter element determines the rate at which transcription is initiated and can act in either orientation. Of particular use as mammalian promoters are the promoters from mammalian viral genes, since the viral genes are often highly expressed and have a broad host range. Examples include the SV40 early promoter, mouse mammary tumor virus LTR promoter, adenovirus major late promoter, herpes simplex virus promoter, and the CMV promoter.",

Similarly, proteins of the invention can be linked to tags that are protein labels, such as an immunodetectable label (e.g., FLAG), a enzymatically detectable label (e.g., GST), and/or an optically detectable label (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), blue fluorescent protein (BFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), luciferase, etc.)",

For example, the ubiquitinated cyclin D1 may be isolated using a standard anti-ubiquitin antibody column. Phosphorylated cyclin D1 may be isolatd using an antibody specific for phosphorylated cyclin D1. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Scopes, R., Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, NY (1982).

A FRET pair consists of a donor fluorophore and an acceptor fluorophore (where the acceptor fluorophore may be a quencher molecule). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor and the fluorescence absorption spectrum of the acceptor must overlap, and the two molecules must be in close proximity. The distance between donor and acceptor at which 50% of donors are deactivated (transfer energy to the acceptor) is defined by the Forster radius, which is typically 10-100 angstroms. Changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum comprising FRET pairs can be detected, indicating changes in the number of that are in close proximity (i.e., within 100 angstroms of each other). This will typically result from the binding or dissociation of two molecules, one of which is labeled with a FRET donor and the other of which is labeled with a FRET acceptor, wherein such binding brings the FRET pair in close proximity.",

See, e.g., DEQOR: Design and Quality Control of RNAi (available on the internet at cluster-1.mpi-cbg.de/Deqor/deqor.html). See also, Henschel et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jul. 1;32(Web Server issue):W113-20. DEQOR is a web-based program which uses a scoring system based on state-of-the-art parameters for siRNA design to evaluate the inhibitory potency of siRNAs. DEQOR, therefore, can help to predict (i) regions in a gene that show high silencing capacity based on the base pair composition and (ii) siRNAs with high silencing potential for chemical synthesis. In addition, each siRNA arising from the input query is evaluated for possible cross-silencing activities by performing BLAST searches against the transcriptome or genome of a selected organism. DEQOR can therefore predict the probability that an mRNA fragment will cross-react with other genes in the cell and helps researchers to design experiments to test the specificity of siRNAs or chemically designed siRNAs.",

                                "siNA molecules can be of any of a variety of forms. For example the siNA can be a double-stranded polynucleotide molecule comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. siNA can also be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary. In this embodiment, each strand generally comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand; such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure, for example wherein the double stranded region is about 15 to about 30, e.g., about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 base pairs; the antisense strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense strand comprises nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof (e.g., about 15 to about 25 or more nucleotides of the siNA molecule are complementary to the target nucleic acid or a portion thereof).",

The siNA can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof.",

The siNA can also comprise a single stranded polynucleotide having nucleotide sequence complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (e.g., where such siNA molecule does not require the presence within the siNA molecule of nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof), wherein the single stranded polynucleotide can further comprise a terminal phosphate group, such as a 5\u2032-phosphate (see for example Martinez et al., 2002, Cell., 110, 563-574 and Schwarz et al., 2002, Molecular Cell, 10, 537-568), or 5\u2032,3\u2032-diphosphate.",

In certain embodiments, the siNA molecules comprise nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence of a target gene. In another embodiment, the siNA molecule interacts with nucleotide sequence of a target gene in a manner that causes inhibition of expression of the target gene.",
                                "As used herein, siNA molecules need not be limited to those molecules containing only RNA, but further encompasses chemically-modified nucleotides and non-nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the invention lack 2\u2032-hydroxy (2\u2032-OH) containing nucleotides. siNAs do not necessarily require the presence of nucleotides having a 2\u2032-hydroxy group for mediating RNAi and as such, siNA molecules of the invention optionally do not include any ribonucleotides (e.g., nucleotides having a 2\u2032-OH group). Such siNA molecules that do not require the presence of ribonucleotides within the siNA molecule to support RNAi can however have an attached linker or linkers or other attached or associated groups, moieties, or chains containing one or more nucleotides with 2\u2032-OH groups. Optionally, siNA molecules can comprise ribonucleotides at about 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% of the nucleotide positions.

In addition, as used herein, the term RNAi is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe sequence specific RNA interference, such as post transcriptional gene silencing, translational inhibition, or epigenetics. For example, siNA molecules of the invention can be used to epigenetically silence a target gene at both the post-transcriptional level or the pre-transcriptional level. In a non-limiting example, epigenetic regulation of gene expression by siNA molecules of the invention can result from siNA mediated modification of chromatin structure or methylation pattern to alter gene expression (see, for example, Verdel et al., 2004, Science, 303, 672-676; Pal-Bhadra et al., 2004, Science, 303, 669-672; Allshire, 2002, Science, 297, 1818-1819; Volpe et al., 2002, Science, 297, 1833-1837; Jenuwein, 2002, Science, 297, 2215-2218; and Hall et al., 2002, Science, 297, 2232-2237).",

For example, an asymmetric hairpin siNA molecule can comprise an antisense region having length sufficient to mediate RNAi in a cell or in vitro system (e.g. about 15 to about 30, or about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleotides) and a loop region comprising about 4 to about 12 (e.g., about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12) nucleotides, and a sense region having about 3 to about 25 (e.g., about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25) nucleotides that are complementary to the antisense region.

Several cancers have been characterized as having elevated cyclin D1 expression and/or elevated cyclin D1 degradation which mediates a tumorigenic phenotype. As discussed in the Examples below, elevated cyclin D1 degradation in a cancerous cell relative to a normal cell of the same tissue type indicates that tumorigenesis is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation, and thus the cancer is amenable to treatment by inhibition of cyclin D1 degradation (e.g., by inhibition of cyclin D1 phosphorylation by MAPK and/or inhibiton of ubiquitination of cyclin D1 by an FBXW8-containin E3 ligase.",

A group of slower migrating bands was detected by the HA antibody exclusively in the anti-cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates in the presence of ubiquitin (lane 2 and 3). The reduced mobility bands were enhanced further after exposure to MG132 (lane 3), indicating that these bands included polyubiquitinated cyclin D1. These results demonstrate that cyclin D1 protein is degraded during the S phase through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cancer cells.",
                                "To determine the cellular fraction where cyclin D1 degradation is accelerated during S phase, we extracted nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) protein from cell lysates. Histone HI was exclusively detected in the nuclear fraction, whereas MEK1 totally expressed in the cytoplasmic extract, suggesting that we successfully fractionated cell lysates (FIG. 4, Panel A). As we observed above, the majority of cyclin D1 was localized in the cytoplasm (FIG. 4, Panel A). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to cyclin D1 (lanes 1 and 2) or IgG (lane 3) and immunoblotted with a HA antibody. Because polyubiquitinated cyclin D1 bands were predominantly detected in the cytoplasmic extracts and because inhibition of nuclear-to cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 through Leptomycin B (LMB) did not enhance these bands significantly in the nucleus (FIG. 4, Panel B), we concluded that cyclin D1 protein is degraded in the cytoplasm specifically in S phase by a proteasome-dependent mechanism in cancer cells."

T98G cells contain mutations in PTEN, which confer inhibition of GSK3\u03b2. A recent report questioned the role of GSK3\u03b2 for cyclin D1 phosphorylation. The Ras pathway activates P13K/PKB/Akt kinases, which in turn inhibit GSK3\u03b2: therefore Ras should stabilize cyclin D1 protein (Diehl et al., 1998. Genes Dev. 12, 3499-511). However, Ras shows a completely opposite effect on cyclin D1 protein (Shao et al., 2000. J Biol Chem. 275, 22916-24). Ras signals facilitate cyclin D1 proteolysis but not stabilization which indicates that cyclin D1 turnover is independent of GSK3\u03b2 and that GSK3\u03b2 is probably not a major cyclin D1 kinase in vivo.",
                                "In order to investigate the role of GSK3\u03b2, immunoblot analysis was performed using a GSK3\u03b2 antibody and a phosphorylation specific antibody to GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2. A phosphorylation specific antibody to GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 was used to measure their endogenous activities because phosphorylations of GSK3\u03b1 at Tyr279 and GSK3\u03b2 at Tyr216 are intramolecular autophosphorylation events in the cells and thereby phosphorylation status reflects their activities (Cole et al., 2004. Biochem J. 377, 249-55). There was no correlation between expression and activities of GSK3\u03b2 and the cell cycle progression in tumorigenic cells because GSK3\u03b2 and its phosphorylated form were ubiquitously expressed throughout the cell cycle and not linked to any specific phase of cell cycle in the examined cancer cells (FIG. 5, Panel B). The phosphorylation status of cyclin D1 protein was shown to be related to total cyclin D1 expression (FIG. 5, Panel B). These results indicate that cyclin D1 phosphorylation is mediated either by auto-phosphorylation through CDK4/6 kinases or by the same regulation mechanism as cyclin D1 gene expression via the MAPK signaling pathway.",

Rb was phosphorylated throughout a complete cycle after re-entry into the cell cycle. In contrast, a dramatic induction of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the nucleus was observed at 12 hrs and its gradual reduction after 12 hrs. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between cyclin D1 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation status, which indicates that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 protein can be mediated by the same regulation mechanism as cyclin D1 gene expression, via the MAPK signaling pathway."

Ectopically expressed WT cyclin D1 protein was used to assess the stability of cyclin D1 protein. The endogenous expression was not assessed because transcription of cyclin D1 is regulated by the Ras/MAPK signaling. Therefore, endogenous expression of cyclin D1 is unable to be detected following inhibition of MAPK activities through the MEK/MAPK inhibitors or serum starvation (Tetsu et al., 2003. Cancer Cell. 3, 233-45). Ectopic expression was distinguished from endogenous expression by the reduced mobility of the HA epitope tagged WT cyclin D1 protein as shown in FIG. 5, Panel A. The following inhibitors were used: LiCl and BIO for GSK3 inhibition (Meijer et al., 2003. Chem Biol. 10, 1255-66; Sato et al., 2004. Nat Med. 10, 55-63; Cohen et al., 2004. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 3, 479-87), AG12275 for CDK4 inhibition (Toogood, 2001. Med Res Rev 6, 487-98; Tetsu et al., 2003. Cancer Cell. 3, 233-45), and U0126 for MEK/MAPK inhibition (Favata et al., 1998. J. Bio. Chem. 273, 18623-32; Tetsu et al., 2003. Cancer Cell. 3, 233-45).",
                                "After 24 hours of treatment with these highly specific small molecule inhibitors, expression levels of cyclin D1 and its phosphorylated form were analyzed (FIG. 5, Panel C). Levels of phosphorylated cyclin D1 were estimated by quantitative scanning with Quantity One (Bio Rad) software and were normalized to levels of total cyclin D1 protein (FIG. 5, Panel C bottom graphs). The inhibition of the kinase activities were assessed using phosphorylation-specific antibodies for GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, Rb and ERK1/2 in the same membrane (Cole et al., 2004. Biochem J. 377, 249-55; Kitagawa et al., 1996. EMBO J. 15, 7060-9; Tetsu et al., 2003. Cancer Cell. 3, 233-45). After 24 hours of treatment with the GSK3 inhibitors (LiCl or BIO) or the CDK4 inhibitor (AG12275), the phosphorylated forms of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 and Rb had disappeared, indicating that the kinase activities of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 or Rb were completely inhibited. However, there was no significant difference in both total cyclin D1 expression and its phosphorylated protein. Thus, the ratios of phosphorylated cyclin D1 protein at Thr286 to total cyclin D1 expression were not changed, which indicates that cyclin D1 phosphorylation was not mediated by GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 or CDK4 activities.",

Twenty-four hours after the exposure to U0126, phosphorylated ERK had disappeared, demonstrating that MAPK activities were totally inhibited. A dramatic induction of cyclin D1 expression was observed after U0126 treatment resulting in a significant reduction in the ratio although the phosphorylated cyclin D1 protein had not completely disappeared within the range of MEK/MAPK inhibitions through U0126. These results demonstrate that cyclin D1 protein is phosphorylated and destabilized by MAPK in cultured cells.",
                                "In order to rule-out the possibility that other phosphorylation sites within cyclin D1 protein might be involved with cyclin D1 stability, the cell line ectopically expressing cyclin D1 T286A was treated with U0126 (FIG. 5, Panel D). The ectopic expression of cyclin D1 T286A protein did not accumulate after drug treatment. These results indicate that MAPK-mediated cyclin D1 ubiquitination and degradation depend on Thr286 and not any other residue within the protein.",

Biochem J. 351, 95-105), endogenous MAPK activity was depleted by serum-starvation. Cell lines expressing either HA-WT or HA-T286A cyclin D1 (FIG. 5, Panel E) were tested. After 24 hours of serum depletion, MAPK activity was completely inhibited. Consequently, endogenous expression of cyclin D1 protein had significantly diminished. A dramatic induction of ectopically expressed WT cyclin D1 protein was observed without increasing the phosphorylated-cyclin D1 protein at Thr286. These results demonstrate that the majority of increased expression of cyclin D1 was not phosphorylated.",
                                "In contrast, there was no increase of ectopic expression of cyclin D1 T286A protein after serum starvation (FIG. 5, Panel E, lanes 1 and 2). To confirm WT cyclin D1 protein was accumulated through an inhibition of MAPK activities after serum depletion, an active form of MEK1 was transfected in the exponentially growing cells (FIG. 5, Panel E lane 3 and 6; Mansour et al., 1994. Science. 265, 966-70). After 24 hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 hours. Panel E shows that phosphorylated-ERK, endogenous cyclin D1 and ectopic expression of WT were completely reversed. However, T286A cyclin D1 was not, which indicates that the effects of serum starvation were clearly via the Ras/MEK/MAPK signals.",

The addition of LiCl resulted in little enhancement indicating that GSK3 does not contribute to phosphorylation and stability of cyclin D1 protein in vivo.

Trends Biochem Sci. 25, 448-53). Through a series of searches, a highly stringent (within 0.041 percentile) D-domain in amino acids 179-193 of cyclin D1 protein (FIG. 6, Panel A) was identified, which indicates that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling cascade is responsible for cyclin D1 phosphorylation.",
                                "In order to determine whether purified ERK/MAPK phosphorylates recombinant cyclin D1, p42 ERK2-associated GST-cyclin D1 in vitro kinase assays were performed (FIG. 6, Panels B and C). Kinase reactions performed in vitro demonstrated that purified ERK2 efficiently phosphorylated GST-full-length wild type (WT) cyclin D1 (FIG. 6, Panel B, lane 2). In contrast, ERK2 failed to phosphorylate the cyclin D1 mutant protein T286A (FIG. 6, Panel B, lane 4), indicating that Thr286 is the major phosphorylation site of ERK/MAPK. Identical results were obtained in the presence of purified CDK4 wherein ERK was shown to phosphorylate cyclin D1 at Thr286, not only in the monomeric form but also within CDK4-cyclin D1 complexes (data not shown).",

FIG. 6, Panel C shows that purified ERK2 effectively phosphorylated WT cyclin D1 (lane 2). However, this did not occur with the T286A (lane 3) and \u0394D (lane 4) mutants. These results indicate that MAPK interacts with cyclin D1 protein through the D-domain to phosphorylate Thr286. Additionally, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis were performed following ectopic expression of Flag-tagged ERK2 with either HA-tagged WT or \u0394D cyclin D1 in HCT 116 colon cancer cells (FIG. 6, Panel D). The ERK2 associated with WT cyclin D1 (lane 2) but associated poorly to \u0394D cyclin D1 (lane 3).

The phosphorylation status of exogenous cyclin D1 expression was analyzed at Thr286.

Exponentially growing HA-WT cyclin D1 SW480 cells were exposed to U0126 for 24 hours and subsequently treated with CHX and chased for 3 hours. Cells were harvested at different times and a protein blot was performed (FIG. 8, Panel A). FIG. 8, Panel B shows that MAPK activity was completely inhibited by U0126. Cyclin D1 expression was quantified and the half-life was calculated (FIG. 8, Panel A bottom graph). In U0126-treated cells, the half-life of cyclin D1 protein was extended (T1/2=60.3 min) from control DMSO-treated cells (T1/2=14.2 min). These results confirmed that the accumulation of WT cyclin D1 protein following MAPK inhibition was due to an increase of the protein stability which indicates that activation of the MAPK signals accelerates cyclin D1 proteolysis in tumorigenic cells.",

The expression profile of cyclin D1 was examined during cell cycle progression from quiescence (FIG. 8, Panel D). Cells were serum starved for 48 hours and then stimulated by the addition of 10% FBS containing media with or without 4-HT. In the presence of 4-HT, a dramatic reduction of cyclin D1 expression was observed specifically in the S phase (FIG. 8, Panel D). In order to investigate whether this was due to accelerated turnover of the cyclin D1 protein, the half-life of endogenous expression of cyclin D1 protein (FIG. 8, Panel E) was assessed. Exponentially growing cells were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of 10 nM 4-HT and subsequently treated with CHX and a half-life was calculated respectively. The half-life of cyclin D1 protein decreased significantly (T1/2=20.6 min) from control DMSO-treated cells (T1/2=59.2 min).

Western blot analysis was performed in mock-infected, DN FBXW8, and DN SKP2 cells to assess production of cyclin D1, p27 Kip1, CDK4 and either DN FBXW8 or DN SKP2 (where the latter were detected using an antibody that specifically binds the FLAG tag). Ectopic expression of \u0394F FBXW8 reduced the number and size of colonies formed relative to the control. (FIG. 19, Panels A-B) However, \u0394F SKP2 had little effect on cell growth because its major target p27 Kip1 (Nakayama et al., 2004) does not play any significant role in the growth control of HCT 116 cells (Tetsu et al., 2003. Cancer Cell. 3, 233-45). (FIGS. 19, Panels A-B) These results indicate that cyclin D1 proteolysis is crucial for proliferation of cancer cells.",
                                "Cyclin D1 degradation was next inhibited by using siRNA to knock down E3 ligase components such as FBXW8, CUL1 or CUL7 in HCT 116 cells. The cell numbers were counted for five days (FIG. 20, Panel A) resulting in significantly reduced cell numbers in siRNA for FBXW8, CUL1, or CUL7. These results deomonstrate that the rapid turnover of cyclin D1 is required for proliferation of cancer cells.",
                                "The reduction of cell proliferation was tested through knockdown of FBXW8 expression is caused by accumulation of cyclin D1, and subsequent sequestration of CDK4 into the cytoplasm (FIG. 20, Panel B). HCT 116 cells were treated either with control (Cont) or FBXW8 (W8) siRNA for 72 hours. Inhibition of FBXW8 expression was verified by a RT-PCR. More than 95% inhibition of FBXW8 mRNA was observed compared to control samples. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were fractioned. Panel B shows that depleting FBXW8 caused a significant accumulation of cyclin D1 protein in the cytoplasm, which was mostly phosphorylated at Thr286. This process resulted in relocalization of CDK4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This caused dramatic reduction of the nuclear CDK4 kinase activities assessed by both phosphorylation status of Rb protein (pRb) and CDK4-associated GST-Rb in vitro kinase assay (FIG. 20, Panel B bottom). These observations show that inhibiting rapid turnover of cyclin D1 induced growth arrest in an Rb-dependent process.",
                                "The constitutive expression of the nuclear protein cyclin D1 T286A-CDK4 was examined to determine whether the complex could abrogate to block cell proliferation caused by siRNA against FBXW8 (FIG. 20, Panels C-D). Cyclin D1 mutant was tested because it is not only resistant to polyubiquitination but also prevents the nuclear export of cyclin D1 during S phase, resulting in its constitutive nuclear localization (Alt et al., 2000. Genes Dev. 14, 3102-14). Importantly, this mutant is functional; ectopically expressed T286A assembled with CDK4 in cultured cells and showed similar levels of kinase activities to wild type cyclin D1 as others demonstrated previously (data not shown; Cheng et al., 1999. EMBO J. 18, 1571-83).",
                                "A cyclin D1 ecdysone-inducible (IND) system in HCT 116 cells was generated. Pon A induced ectopic expression of HA-tagged T286A in physiological levels (FIG. 20, Panel C). A colony formation assay (FIG. 20, Panel D) was then performed. One hundred single cells from T286A IND HCT 116 were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of Pon A, and control (Cont) or FBXW8 siRNA. Cells were cultured for 2 weeks, and stained with crystal violet. FIG. 20, Panel D shows that ectopically expressed physiological levels of nuclear protein cyclin D1 T286A dramatically rescued cells from growth arrest. These results demonstrate that FBXWS-mediated cyclin D1 degradation is essential for proliferation of cancer cells.",

SKP1 interacts with FBXW8 together with CUL1 or CUL7 via a domain called F-box in the N-terminus. CUL1 or CUL7 recruits RBX1, which in turn conscripts an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 to add a multiubiquitin chain to cyclin D1.",
