    "title": "Immunomagnetic Sequential Ultrafiltration (iSUF) Platform for Enrichment and Purification of Extracellular Vesicles from Biofluids",
    "date": "2020-05-15",
    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from tumor cells have the potential to provide a much-needed source of non-invasive molecular biomarkers for liquid biopsies. However, current methods for EV isolation have limited specificity towards tumor-derived EVs that limit their clinical use. Here, we present an approach called immunomagnetic sequential ultrafiltration (iSUF) that consists of sequential stages of purification and enrichment of EVs (nonspecifically and specifically) in approximately 2 h. In iSUF, EVs present in different volumes of biofluids (0.5 mL to 100 mL) can be significantly enriched (up to 1000 times), with up to 99 % removal of contaminating proteins (e.g., albumin). The EV recovery rate by iSUF for cell culture media (CCM), serum, and urine corresponded to 98.0% \u00b1 3.6%, 96.0% \u00b1 2.0% and 94.0% \u00b1 1.9%, respectively (p > 0.05). The final step of iSUF enables the separation of tumor-specific EVs by incorporating immunomagnetic beads specific to a target subpopulation of EVs. Serum from a small cohort of clinical samples from metastatic breast cancer (BC) patients and healthy donors were processed by the iSUF platform and the isolated EVs from patients showed significantly higher expression levels of BC biomarkers (i.e., HER2, CD24, and miR21).",

                "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as relevant diagnostic and therapeutic entities present in different biofluids1. EVs are lipid particles with sizes that vary from 30\u00a0nm to a few microns2. EVs are endogenously shed from the surface of cells through distinct mechanisms, leading to different types of vesicles3. Multivesicular bodies that contain smaller vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their internal vesicles (i.e., exosomes)4. Larger lipid vesicles can directly bud from the plasma membrane as microvesicles5. EVs carry various biological cargo, including proteins, RNA, and DNA fragments, giving EVs unique roles in regulating cell\u2013cell communication6. Moreover, it has been shown that tumor EVs (tEVs) can tune cellular microenvironments at distant sites to promote angiogenesis, invasiveness, immunosuppression, and metastasis7\u201310.",
                "Different proof of concept studies have used tEVs to develop liquid biopsy assays to diagnose and monitor cancer at different stages11,12. EVs are more abundant than other circulating biomarkers (e.g., circulating tumor cells), and they are structurally more robust13. However, tEVs present in biofluids are surrounded by massive amounts of normal EVs (nEVs; secreted by healthy cells), and other biomolecules (e.g., albumin, lipoproteins, ribonucleoproteins, globulins)14, thus novel purification methods are required to isolate tEVs15. A recent survey on the methods used for isolation and characterization of EVs from research laboratories around the world reveals that more than 80% of researchers use ultracentrifugation (UC) for the isolation of EVs and western blotting for protein characterization16. Although UC and density gradient methods can be used to process different biofluids, they are labor-intensive, produce protein aggregate contaminants, and are nonspecific towards EV type (derived from a tumor or normal cells)17\u201319. Other EV isolation methods, including polymeric or salt precipitation kits20, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns (e.g., qEVs)21, and nano/microdevices have limitations22. Precipitation kits have low EV recovery rates, lack specificity, and have low purity23. qEVs can separate EVs into different size fractions with high purity and low protein contamination, but have low EV recovery rates and are nonspecific for EV subpopulation24. Recently, immunoaffinity methods that were developed for cell separation have been adapted for specific EV isolation25. Microfluidic and plasmonic devices have been functionalized with antibodies to target different EV populations26,27. However, the majority of these approaches target tetraspanins and annexins, which are ubiquitous proteins present in all EVs28. Other attempts used epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM); however, this antigen is also expressed on normal epithelial EVs29. Recently, we demonstrated the use of nanostructured polymeric brushes conjugated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrated into a microfluidic channel to enhance specificity towards tumor-derived EVs isolated from glioblastoma (GBM) patients30. Although this approach can achieve a remarkable 94% specificity towards tEVs, the limited amount of biofluid processed (1\u20131.5\u00a0mL of serum or plasma) and the retention of albumin, significantly limits its use for proteomics31.",
                "Here, we present a novel approach termed immunomagnetic sequential ultrafiltration (iSUF) that overcomes current limitations for EV enrichment and purification. iSUF combines three stages of ultrafiltration and immunoaffinity separation: a tangential flow filtration (TFF) step, a standard centrifugal enrichment step, and a magnetic-bead antibody-based EV capture step. Using iSUF, we demonstrate that small or large volumes of biofluid can be processed (~\u20090.5\u00a0mL or 100\u00a0mL) while concomitantly removing up to 99% of contaminating proteins (e.g., albumin). We have demonstrated the use of iSUF to enrich EVs present in three different types of biofluids: cell culture media (CCM), serum, and urine for which the sample processing time was approximately 2\u00a0h. Another feature of iSUF is that it can enrich EVs up to 1000 times with an EV recovery rate higher than 94%, which overcomes the limitations of other commercially available methods. To further validate the clinical utility of iSUF, we have processed serum samples from 10 metastatic breast cancer (BC) patients and demonstrated the presence of HER2, CD24 and miR21 biomarkers at significantly higher levels compared to healthy controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05)."

                        "The schematic workflow of the iSUF platform is shown in Fig.\u00a01. In stage 1, TFF was used to enrich and diafiltrate EVs from the biofluid. Thus, biofluid from the sample feed reservoir was removed as filtrate/permeate from the TFF filter. Diafiltration is a fractionation process that removes smaller molecules (filtrate/permeate) through the filter and leaves larger molecules in the reservoir by adding a diafiltration solution into the reservoir at the same rate as the filtrate is generated. Briefly, a TFF pump circulates the biofluid through a hollow fiber filter cartridge at a controlled flow rate. Sample fractionation depends on the hollow fiber membrane pore size (MWCO), which should be large enough to permeate proteins and free nucleic acids while small enough to retain EVs. During the enrichment step, freely permeable molecules are partially removed. To remove the remaining contaminants, a diafiltration step with PBS is necessary. The diafiltration processing time is proportional to the biofluid volume in the system35, so diafiltration started with a total biofluid volume of 7\u00a0mL, which was the sum of the dead volume of the self-build TFF system (2\u00a0mL in the product container) and 5\u00a0mL remaining in the different tubing of the setup. Liquid in the tubing was necessary to protect the EVs from drying out and to enable constant volume diafiltration. Hence, CCM and urine were pre-enriched to a total volume of 7\u00a0mL. For the processing of serum, 0.5\u00a0mL of sample was diluted to a total volume of 7\u00a0mL in PBS and then processed with diafiltration. The input flow rate was kept at 35\u00a0mL/min using a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). The sample volume after stage 1 was approximately 2\u00a0mL (dead volume of the TFF system). At stage 2, ultra-centrifugal units with 10\u00a0kDa MWCO were used to further enrich the samples to 100\u00a0\u03bcL at 3000\u00d7g for 20\u00a0min. For specific isolation of subpopulations of EVs, stage 3 of iSUF, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were functionalized with biotinylated antibodies (e.g., EGFR, EpCAM, HER2) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to target tEVs. 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the processed sample (after stage 2) was incubated with the antibody-coated beads for 1\u00a0h at RT. The efficiency of the iSUF platform for isolating tEVs was evaluated using flow cytometry and total internal reflection\u00a0fluorescent (TIRF) microscopy. EVs were also characterized for their size, concentration, morphology, and molecular content (e.g., protein, RNA).Figure 1The Immunomagnetic sequential ultrafiltration (iSUF) platform. (A) Schematic representation of iSUF stages 1, 2, 3, including tangential flow filtration (TFF) purification, centrifugal unit enrichment, and tEV immunoaffinity isolation, respectively. In stage 1, biofluids were processed using a 500\u00a0kDa TFF filter, EVs were retained in the retentate and enriched in 7\u00a0mL while free proteins and nucleic acids permeated through the TFF filter. Then the PBS valve was opened to start TFF diafiltration until removing up to 99% of free proteins. Finally, EVs were recovered in 2\u00a0mL of PBS after flushing the TFF system with air. In stage 2, EVs were centrifuged using a 10\u00a0kDa centrifugal unit at 3000\u00d7g and enriched in 100\u00a0\u03bcL. In stage 3, tEVs were captured using antibodies immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (i.e., EGFR) and subsequently pulled out with a magnet. (B) iSUF stage 1 purification performance for different biofluids. Cell supernatant (CCM), urine, and serum took 80, 100, and 120\u00a0min to obtain up to 99% efficiency of free protein and nucleic acid removal."

                        "To overcome current limitations of the enrichment and purification of EVs and on-demand EV subpopulation characterization, we developed the iSUF platform (Fig.\u00a01 A) which includes three stages: (1) tangential flow filtration (TFF) for the enrichment and purification of EVs, (2) centrifugation for further enrichment of EVs, and (3) immunomagnetic affinity selection for desired EV subpopulation isolation. We used the iSUF platform to process various volumes (0.5\u2013100\u00a0mL) of different biofluids (CCM, serum, and urine).",
                        "To design stage 1, many parameters of TFF processing required optimization, including the selection of membrane pore size (MWCO), sample processing temperature, sample flow rate, pressure, and sample protein concentration. We tested membrane filters with two MWCO sizes (300 and 500\u00a0kDa) to determine the optimal MWCO that maximizes the removal of free proteins and nucleic acids while reducing processing time. Our experiments showed that 500\u00a0kDa filter membranes were able to remove up to 99% of free proteins with over 99% EV recovery rate (Eq.\u00a01, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). When a 300\u00a0kDa membrane filter was used, only 80% of free proteins were removed. Moreover, a 500\u00a0kDa membrane filter was chosen since it processed samples 2\u20133 times faster than a 300\u00a0kDa membrane filter (Supplementary Table 1). The TFF stage 1 of iSUF ran at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to minimize EV degradation37. We further tried to optimize sample processing time, which was highly dependent on the flow rate. The flow rate was linearly associated with the shear rate generated by the filter based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Repligen), which exerted a shear force on the EVs. Then, we used a flow rate of 35\u00a0mL/min to maintain a shear rate below 5000/s38. High flow rates increased the system pressure, mainly when the protein concentration of the sample was high (>\u200915\u00a0mg/mL). We kept the pressure of the system below 68.9\u00a0kPa to avoid leakage and maximize the lifespan of the 500\u00a0kDa filter. We used dilutions of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to test the effect of protein concentration on system pressure at 35\u00a0mL/min. Our results showed that protein concentration must be equal or lower than 15\u00a0mg/mL to maintain the pressure of the system below 68.9\u00a0kPa to protect the filter (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02).Figure 2iSUF enrichment performance and characterization of EVs separated from CCM, serum and urine using iSUF.

Enrichment factors (EFs) were calculated as the ratio of EV concentration in biofluids present before and after iSUF processing. CCM was processed for U-251, MCF-7 and A375 cell lines.

                        "At stage 2 of iSUF, EVs were loaded into centrifugal filter units and were spun down at 3000\u00d7g. We compared the recovery rates of EVs and processing time for different filter pore sizes. A 3\u00a0kDa filter unit obtained over 99% recovery rate and took 60\u00a0min to spin down, while a 10\u00a0kDa unit obtained a 95% recovery rate in 20\u00a0min, and a 30\u00a0kDa filter obtained only a 70% recovery rate and took 15\u00a0min to spin down (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). We selected the 10\u00a0kDa filter unit to maintain a high recovery rate while reducing sample processing time. To enrich tEVs (stage 3 of iSUF), we tested incubation of 3\u00a0\u03bcm magnetic beads with different concentrations of biotinylated antibodies (10, 20, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 1\u00a0h, 2\u00a0h, and 12\u00a0h at RT, and 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Overnight incubation with 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of antibody was able to yield an optimal bead-antibody coverage. Then, we examined the volume ratio of beads to EVs at 5 \u03bcL/100 \u03bcL, 20 \u03bcL/100 \u03bcL, and 80 \u03bcL/100 \u03bcL during the bead/tEVs incubation step. The 20/100 \u03bcL ratio achieved the highest bead-tEVs capture efficiency (>\u200990%).Figure 3Comparison of size distribution and purity of EVs isolated with different platforms.

We tested the ability of our platform to purify and enrich EVs from three different biofluids (i.e., CCM, serum, and urine; Fig.\u00a01B). 50\u00a0mL of CCM, and 100\u00a0mL of urine were enriched to 7\u00a0mL. Subsequently, PBS diafiltration buffer was used to remove the remaining protein contaminants from CCM and urine in 80\u00a0min and 100\u00a0min, respectively. The percentage of remaining protein is defined as the mass of free proteins in the TFF retentate at a specified time divided by their initial mass in the sample (Eq.\u00a02). For serum, the initial high concentration of proteins (>\u200980\u00a0mg/mL) required an initial dilution of 0.5\u00a0mL of the sample in 7\u00a0mL of PBS. Subsequently, PBS diafiltration buffer was used to remove the remaining protein contaminants from serum in 120\u00a0min. We first tested iSUF with a 10% BSA solution for which an SDS-PAGE gel showed extensive removal of albumin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Moreover, analysis of the purified samples by an SDS-PAGE gel indicated that iSUF removed BSA from CCM, human serum albumin (HSA) and globulins from serum, and Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THF) and HSA from urine.

Accordingly, the EV recovery rate (the ratio of the total number of EVs post-processing by iSUF to the total number of EVs pre-processing) was 98%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6%, 96%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0% and 94%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9% for CCM, serum, and urine, respectively (Eq.\u00a04). Considering that EVs are heterogeneous in size, we also tested the\u00a0enrichment factor across a wide size range of EVs (70\u00a0nm\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm) in CCM with similar results (n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009>\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a02B). Moreover, the EV concentrations obtained by iSUF was greater than the concentrations obtained by UC. This difference was consistent across the 70\u00a0nm\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm size range (n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a02C), with iSUF enriching EVs at two to three orders of magnitude higher than UC (approximately 1011 EVs concentrated by iSUF and 109 for UC). Similar results were obtained with comparisons for the enrichment of EVs present in serum and urine. With iSUF, EVs from serum and urine were enriched almost at the same level (1012 EVs/mL; Fig.\u00a02D). We confirmed the presence of EVs by using atomic force and electron microscopy on the different biofluids processed. The majority of isolated EVs exhibited a round morphology with heterogeneous size distribution. Cryo transmission electron microscopy images (TEM) images of isolated EVs showed the presence of a double-layered lipid membrane, a representative characteristic of EVs39 (Fig.\u00a02E, F).",
                        "To further test our iSUF platform, we performed comparative studies with different commercially available EV isolation methods: qEV, TEI, and UC. 0.5\u00a0mL of serum from healthy donors were processed with different EV isolation platforms. EVs have shown a comparable size range for all platforms, but iSUF obtained a higher EV concentration within the 70\u00a0nm\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm size range (Fig.\u00a03A, Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Notice that all plots presented a right-skewed distribution. Moreover, we plotted the probability distribution as reported previously (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09)40, which showed an exponential decay trend for all the isolation methods that were verified by the Kolmogorov D test (p\u2009>\u20090.05)40. However, qEV, TEI, and UC did not show this trend clearly (Fig.\u00a03A) due to large losses of EVs during the isolation process. Following the MISEV2018 guidelines, subpopulations of EVs can be described independently of the EV biogenesis pathway36. Such that subpopulations of small EVs (sEVs) and medium/large EVs (m/l-EVs) can be defined based on size, with EVs smaller than 100\u00a0nm or 200\u00a0nm as sEVs and EVs larger than 200\u00a0nm as m/l-EVs. Considering that the stretchable nanopore membranes NP150 and NP300 cover the corresponding size range for sEVs and m/l-EVs, respectively41. we compared the mean size of these EV subpopulations by different EV isolation methods (Fig.\u00a03B). For sEVs, EVs processed by iSUF were significantly smaller than UC (n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.05). For m/l-EVs, EVs purified by UC were larger than all other techniques (n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Then, we compared the total concentration and purity of isolated EVs using different methods. iSUF enriched EVs significantly more efficiently than all the tested methods (n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a03C). The concentration of EVs enriched by iSUF was on average 51, 7, and 56 times higher than qEV, TEI, and UC. The purity of isolated EVs was normalized and evaluated in terms of the ratio between EV concentration and remaining contaminating protein concentration present in samples after purification using the different methods (Eq.\u00a05). The purity of the isolated EVs by iSUF was 100\u201310,000 times higher than the different tested methods (Fig.\u00a03D).",
                        "Repeatability experiments for the EV recovery rate and protein removal efficiency from samples processed by iSUF were also conducted (CCM, n\u2009=\u200910; serum, n\u2009=\u200910; Urine, n\u2009=\u200910). Both sEVs and m/l-EVs in all biofluids demonstrated a mean value above 94% for the EV recovery rate. The recovery rate of sEVs in CCM, serum, and urine exhibited 4.2%, 3.7%, and 2.4% coefficient variations, respectively, while m/l-EVs showed 3.7%, 3.3%, and 2.5% coefficient variations (Eq.\u00a06).

For protein analysis, the protein concentration was 6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, almost eightfold more protein obtained than when the same biofluid was processed by UC (Fig.\u00a04B). Total RNA and protein quantification were carried out for serum and urine from 5 healthy donors. 0.5\u00a0mL of serum and 100\u00a0mL of urine processed by iSUF produced 54\u2009\u00b1\u200940\u00a0ng/mL and 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0ng/mL of RNA, respectively (Fig.\u00a04C).

                        "tEVs are outnumbered by EVs from non-tumor cells that require removal to perform accurate molecular analysis42. One way to isolate tEVs is to exploit the presence of specific surface markers43. Our iSUF platform enables the separation of subpopulations of EVs by capturing them on magnetic beads through immunoaffinity. To demonstrate our approach, we used a model system that consisted of spiking fluorescently labeled tEVs from a cancer cell line (i.e., U251 EVs) in 0.5\u00a0mL of serum and 100\u00a0mL of urine from healthy donors (n\u2009=\u20093). 3-\u03bcm magnetic beads were functionalized with EGFR as the capture antibody. All samples were processed through all stages of iSUF, and the captured subpopulation of EVs was characterized and quantified using TIRF and imaging flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a05A). A comparable fluorescent signal was obtained between the positive control (tEVs from U251 cells) and spiked samples processed in serum and urine (88%\u2009\u00b1\u20091% for serum, and 93%\u2009\u00b1\u20092% for urine), which verified the high recovery efficiency and their purity of tEVs. The biofluids spiked with tEVs were also processed by UC, which yielded a significantly lower fluorescent signal (3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 times lower, Fig.\u00a05A). Furthermore, to determine tEV RNA isolation efficiency by iSUF, lysed U251-EVs (positive control) and bead-isolated U251-EVs were extracted. iSUF showed over 90% RNA isolation efficiency for the EGFR+ tEVs (Fig.\u00a05B). Moreover, the RNA content of bead-extracted tEVs from serum using the iSUF platform was sevenfold higher than UC, which was mainly attributed to the high yield of total EVs recovered in iSUF (Fig.\u00a05C). The high RNA content of tEVs from serum isolated using iSUF also confirmed the ability of iSUF to enrich and retrieve tumor targets from mixed populations of EVs."

                        "The emergence of targeted therapies require a precise characterization of the molecular subtypes of a patient\u2019s tumor44. For BC patients (e.g., luminal A/B, triple-negative), the molecular subtype is typically determined by testing a tissue biopsy for the presence or absence of three essential proteins: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)45. However, a tissue-based tumor profile is subject to sampling bias, provides only a snapshot of tumor heterogeneity, and cannot be obtained repeatedly46. These limitations restrict early cancer detection and significantly contribute to the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of BC patients47. The analysis of EVs present in cancer patients biofluids provides a minimally invasive method to quantify different biomarkers that would enable precise diagnosis or response to treatment48. To test the potential use of the iSUF platform in screening biomarkers for BC, we processed 0.5\u00a0mL of serum from 10 metastatic BC patients and quantified the expression levels of HER2, CD24, and miR21 on patient isolated EVs49\u201351. After stage 3 of iSUF, magnetic beads were isolated using a magnet and incubated with detection antibodies and MBs. Then, the magnetic beads were processed with imaging flow cytometry and TIRF microscopy. Similar volumes of serum from healthy donors were processed and analyzed. The age of the healthy donors was between 21 and 68\u00a0years old. Although the age range was wider than from our BC patient cohort, a comparison of levels of expression for HER2, CD24, and miR21 between healthy donors samples did not show statistically significant differences (p\u2009>\u20090.05, Supplementary Fig.\u00a013. We obtained representative images and histograms that quantify the number of beads and their corresponding fluorescent intensities (Fig.\u00a06A, B) for BC patient and healthy donor samples. Both protein and miRNA show significantly higher expression in BC patient samples (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06B), which suggested that iSUF can differentiate tumor biomarkers (Supplementary Table 4). Moreover, we have characterized the CD9 and CD63 levels of protein expression in serum samples from both cohort of samples. Although in this case, similar levels of expression were obtained (p\u2009>\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a06A, B)."

                "Recently, EVs have been explored for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, including liquid biopsy assays for cancer diagnostics, and nanocarriers for drugs and nucleic acids52,53. The large number of tEVs compared to other rare biomarkers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, CTCs) makes them more statistical reliable54. Innovative methods developed for the enrichment and purification of EVs should remove all contaminants (e.g., free proteins), have a high yield, work amongst different biofluids, and maintain the integrity of the EVs. We have engineered a new platform that includes a TFF enrichment and purification stage, a centrifugal-unit enrichment stage, and a magnetic separation stage for specific isolation of subpopulations of EVs (e.g., tEVs). In stages 1 and 2, iSUF performs enrichment and purification of all EVs (e.g., tEVs and nEVs). In stage 3, tEVs are isolated based on their tumor-specific surface markers. 300\u00a0kDa and 500\u00a0kDa TFF filters were initially selected for this study because the molecular weights of the major free proteins in CCM (e.g., BSA, 65\u00a0kDa), serum (e.g., HSA, 65\u00a0kDa) and urine (e.g., THP, 98\u00a0kDa) were below 300\u00a0kDa55\u201357. After testing, a 500\u00a0kDa TFF filter was finally chosen for subsequent experiments because of its minimal EV loss and faster processing time (~\u20092\u00a0h).",
                "Different biofluids required different TFF diafiltration buffer volumes and different scale of TFF hollow fiber filters to remove most contaminants. CCM and urine contain relatively low concentrations of protein contaminants58,59, so a small total diafiltration buffer volume was required to remove the majority of free proteins. Unlike CCM and urine, the serum has a significant amount of free proteins60. Therefore, a large total diafiltration buffer was necessary to remove the free protein in serum. iSUF was able to achieve up to 99% of free protein removal efficiency. Free proteins removed by iSUF were shown as decreased bands on the SDS-PAGE gel. Other bands were increasing on the SDS-PAGE gel because those correspond to different proteins present on EVs, which were enriched by the iSUF61\u201365. Also, there are very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)) that overlap in size with EVs that also might be enriched2,66,67.",
                "Although TFF can concentrate and purify samples, the final product volume is mostly dependent on the dead volume of the specific TFF system. Therefore, further enrichment is necessary to concentrate the samples (e.g., spin down to\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcL) for applications such as the diagnosis of rare biomarkers68. Centrifugal units with different MWCOs (3, 10, and 30\u00a0kDa) were evaluated in terms of processing time and yield in our study. A larger MWCO size required shorter centrifugation time, but more EVs were lost because prolonged high-speed centrifugation elongated EVs into an oval shape which made them squeeze through the filter membrane69,70. The centrifugal unit with the 10\u00a0kDa MWCO was optimal with the shortest processing time and highest yield.",
                "We also compared EVs purified from serum and urine samples of healthy donors. EVs from urine and serum can serve as prognosis biomarkers for clinical analysis71,72. Serum is the most commonly used biofluid in the clinical setting with the highest EV concentration73. Compared to serum, urine collection is minimally invasive and can be obtained in larger volumes74, but it usually suffers from much lower EV concentration75. Interestingly, using our iSUF platform, the EV RNA concentration in the final products of urine samples (originating from ~\u2009100\u00a0mL of collected sample volume) were comparable to those of serum samples (originating from 0.5\u00a0mL of collected sample volume). This suggests that clinical diagnosis by urinary EVs is possible. However, there is still a concern towards urinary EV collection because of large variabilities in the urine volume and its EV concentration. More efforts are needed to come up with a gold standard protocol for urine collection and processing. For protein in urinary EVs, we found that the amount of protein was lower than the amount of protein obtained from serum EVs, which might be explained by the degradation of EV membrane proteins by urine proteases76.",
                "In this study, we compared the performance of iSUF with three different EV isolation techniques (TEI, qEV, and UC) to determine EV concentration, purity, and quantity of RNA recovered. As other authors have discussed77,78, we found that UC, a traditional method for EV isolation, has raised concerns about the integrity, yield, and purity of EVs after purification. Interestingly, we found UC-isolated EVs were larger than other platforms, one possible explanation is the presence of extensive levels of protein aggregates that cause bias. For our UC method, washing steps using multi-rounds ultracentrifugation were not applied, since it was shown that purity of the samples did not increase significantly when adding washing steps, and a significant loss of enriched EVs could occur55,79\u201383. Moreover, although qEV obtained a relatively pure product, its recovery rate was low; TEI obtained a relatively higher EV number, while retaining massive amounts of free protein (Fig.\u00a03C, D). Therefore, low EV concentration and purity will impact the accuracy of molecular analysis of EVs84.",
                "We used the MISEV 2018 guidelines to define EVs: small EVs (sEVs) and medium and large EVs (m/l-EVs)36. Following these definitions, we found that the concentration and average size of EVs in patient samples and healthy controls varied (Supplementary Table 4). Different factors may explain these differences. Subtypes and stages of BC in the patient cohort, may contribute to the difference in the metrics. Moreover, we obtained our patient samples from a biobank, we had minimal control of the storage conditions, thus it was possible that some degradation of the samples could occur. It is known that factors such as material of the container, temperature of storage, and cycles of freezing and thawing may also influence the concentration and mean size of EVs85\u201388. Considering all these aspects, the size distributions and concentrations of EVs that we obtained for the different samples are within the reported values in the literature. Previously concentrations of EVs in serum from cancer patients are between 109 and 1011 particles/mL89\u201392.",
                "Differentiating EV particles and other non-EV particles (e.g., lipoproteins) when measuring size distribution and concentration is challenging for all current methods, including TRPS and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)66,93\u201397. This is because the size range of different lipoproteins [e.g., 7\u201313\u00a0nm (HDL); 21\u201327\u00a0nm (LDL); and 30\u201390\u00a0nm (VLDL)]98 may overlap with the reported size ranges for sEVs and m/l-EVs36. Thus, current methods for EV size characterization and concentration have certain limitations88,99\u2013101. For iSUF, we used the TRPS method to measure size distribution and concentration of EVs. Different nanopore stretchable membranes (NP150, NP300, NP600, NP800, and NP1000) were selected, covering a broad size range of EVs such as 70\u20131000\u00a0nm102. The 70\u00a0nm cut-off were chosen since EVs in samples processed by iSUF, exhibited a range above 70\u00a0nm. Choosing a small stretchable membrane such as NP100 and NP80 that have limits of detection of 50\u00a0nm and 40\u00a0nm, respectively, did not change the size ranges of EVs in our samples after iSUF (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). Thus, iSUF intrinsically filters out the majority of lipoproteins and EVs that overlap in size. This effect is beneficial since we are trying to characterize EVs with minimal contribution of lipoproteins. We consider the 70\u00a0nm cut-off used for the TRPS measurements as appropriate. Moreover, above this value the different characterization metrics are considered accurate. The particle count measurements can verify this for each one of the methods used in our study (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015). A linear relationship indicates an accurate measurement30. In Fig.\u00a03, we found that the lower limit of detection varies for the different methods, indicating an intrinsic loss of EVs during processing samples with different methods. However, iSUF shows better recovery for sEVs and m/l-EVs. The wide upper range showed by UC could be indicative that we measure aggregates of EVs103\u2013106. Our measurements are in agreement with MISEV 2018 since sEVs, and m/l-EVs are in the 100\u2013150\u00a0nm and larger than 200\u00a0nm, respectively36,63,107\u2013111.",
                "We are interested in the enrichment and isolation of tEVs to characterize tumor-related proteins and RNAs. Like other immunoaffinity methods112\u2013114, iSUF captured and isolated EVs using specific tumor surface proteins. iSUF differentiated metastatic BC patients from healthy donors by detecting significantly higher expression levels of proteins and RNA biomarkers present in EVs (e.g., HER2, CD24, and miR21). Based on previous reports, HER2 and miR21 are cancer-associated protein and microRNA species, and are known to be overexpressed in metastatic BCs115,116. Compared to miR21 and HER2, CD24 is relatively less investigated in BC but was previously identified as being released from BC stem cells117. Furthermore, a recent study indicated that serum CD24 is elevated among BC patients118. Moreover, it is important to note that one of these biomarkers may not be a reliable predictor of BC alone. However, the combination of several biomarkers can serve as a tool for BC risk assessment.",
                "In conclusion, iSUF was proposed for rapid, efficient, and specific isolation of EVs from different biofluids. The EV recovery rate mean value was above 94%, with 90% tumor RNA isolation efficiency and negligible concentrations of free proteins and nucleic acids. Although iSUF does not process a sample in the shortest time (80\u2013120\u00a0min), its versatility working with different biofluids, sample volumes, and high purity after sample processing constitutes unmatched advantages over current methods used in the field. Overall, we found that the iSUF platform isolated and enriched EVs from a scaled-up sample volume with high purity and yield in a sterile and quick manner simultaneously, and isolated tEVs with high specificity, while other current methods could not guarantee all of those conditions at the same time. Furthermore, we recognize that the iSUF platform has potentially broad clinical applications beyond liquid biopsies for cancer diagnosis or monitoring."
