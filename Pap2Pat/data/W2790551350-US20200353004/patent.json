                        "Conventional T cells (Tcon) can be manipulated to improve recognition and destruction of pathogens or tumors. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) comprise a subset of T cells with immunosuppressive function. Treg can be manipulated to prevent or treat autoimmunity, transplant rejection, allergy and chronic inflammatory diseases.",
                        "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) emerge as promising alternative for the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs). Other than TCRs, CARs are artificial receptors that contain an antibody-type specificity that can bind surface antigens independent of MHC. The specific recognition of particular antigens by CAR-T cells is mediated by antibody-derived single chain variable fragments (scFv) with an extracellular spacer domain that are coupled via a transmembrane region to an intracellular TCR-derived signaling domain (Gross et al. 1989; Kuwana et al. 1987). In murine models, redirected CAR-Tregs reactive against myelin basic protein were able to ameliorate EAE (Mekala and Geiger 2005) and also CAR-Tregs specific for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were successfully redirected to the colon where they were highly potent in suppressing colitis and development of its associated colorectal cancer (Blat et al. 2014; Elinav et al. 2009; Elinav et al. 2008). More recently, human CAR-Tregs were redirected toward HLA-A2 as commonly mismatched antigen in transplantation and have been shown to suppress xenogeneic GvHD (MacDonald et al. 2016; Noyan et al. 2017; Boardman et al. 2017). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CAR-Tregs have the potential to ameliorate allergic airway inflammation (Skuljec et al. 2017) and to prevent neutralizing immune responses against Factor VIII in mice (Yoon et al. 2017). McGovern et al (2017, Frontiers in Immunology, Vol. 8, Art. 1517 pp:1-6) reviews the current state of the art for Tregs expressing CARs.",
                        "To our knowledge the CAR constructs which have been used so far in Tregs have a CD28 co-stimulatory domain.",
                        "The identification of disease-relevant target antigens as prerequisite for the in vitro generation of antigen-specific Tregs remains a major challenge. Furthermore, functional assays for the analysis of CAR-Treg efficacy are limited due to a lack of markers that allow to specifically identify Treg and to test their specific activation requirements. This is important for the generation of optimal Treg CAR constructs and for generation of optimized Treg transplants, that is maximal CAR-related Treg functional activity and minimal contamination with effector T cells. Therefore, requirements for the activation and expansion of CAR-Tregs which can significantly differ from Tcons remain poorly understood.",

                        "It is crucial to have pure populations of Treg cells for therapeutic application and to be able to evaluate the effects of the CAR constructs on Treg function which might differ from the requirement of Tcon. However, in-vitro Treg populations are in general contaminated with Tcon cells and both populations are not easily separated from each other. To identify and isolate true activated Tregs from a sample comprising activated regulatory T cells and activated conventional T cells is a requirement for the analysis of effects of specific CAR constructs for Tregs in vitro and subsequently their functionality in vivo. Therefore the task to define the conditions for optimal CAR-mediated activation of Treg functional activity and to generate optimized CAR Treg has not been solved so far.",
                        "Such an identification and separation can be performed by the method as disclosed in EP2306191B1.",
                        "Here we show, by comparing different signaling domains, which are known to activate conventional T cells (Tcon) that surprisingly the use of the CD137 (4-1BB) co-stimulatory domain has a selective advantage for stimulating and expanding human regulatory T cells. This is important to optimize Treg function for adoptive Treg therapies.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows that surprisingly in-vitro Tregs are better activated via the CAR (as shown by CAR-ligand (antigen) induced expression of CD137 and expansion) when the CAR contains a CD137 (4-1BB) co-stimulatory signaling domain (herein also referred to as \u201cCD137 CAR\u201d) as compared to a CAR with a CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domain (herein also referred to as \u201cCD28 CAR\u201d), whereas the opposite is true in Tcons. Thus the use of the CD137 CAR allows optimal stimulation of Tregs, which can be exploited for in vitro selection of activated Tregs following CAR-ligand (antigen) stimulation to generate highly purified CAR-ligand (antigen) reactive Treg. It is also expected that in-vivo CD137 CARs are better activated and expanded by the CAR ligand (antigen) than Tregs with CD28 CARs, since Treg function in vivo is strictly dependent on functional antigen-receptor activation, which is mimicked by the CAR constructs. The transduction or transfection of Tregs with a CAR as disclosed herein (a CAR with a CD137 co-stimulatory domain) allows the efficient in vitro activation of said engineered Treg cell via the CAR and provides a mean for the subsequent sorting of the activated Treg that express the CAR. This allows to generate a pure and functional Treg CAR population with benefits for the therapeutic use in a subject in need thereof because in vivo it will provide better safety due to less contaminants and improved therapeutic activity due to better CAR-ligand (antigen) induced activation and expansion. Furthermore in a specific embodiment of the invention the CD137 CAR provides improved in vivo activation of Treg in response to the soluble antigen such as dextran that is applied as external stimulus to the subject as compared to CD28 CAR or CARs with other signaling domains that do not react to such external stimuli, which in addition enhances the in vivo activity of the transferred Tregs, since it leads to the expansion of Tregs and increased Treg activity will also result in improved reactivity to the endogenous TCR or the Treg. In this way the CAR activation can be used to boost the natural regulatory or suppressive activity of the Treg to endogenous Treg antigens, without the need to know the specific Treg antigen targets.",
                        "The Tregs as disclosed herein are well suited for prevention or treatment of a subject suffering from immune-mediated diseases, such as autoimmunity, transplant rejection, allergy or chronic inflammatory diseases.",
                        "In one embodiment of the invention the CD137 CAR expressed in the Treg is specific for the exogenous soluble antigen dextran. The administration of dextran to a subject in need to be treated with said CAR specific for dextran may allow for a controlled and sustained immune response of the Treg cell expressing said CAR for prevention or treatment against autoimmunity, transplant rejection, allergy or chronic inflammatory diseases."

The extracellular domain may be linked to the transmembrane domain by a linker. The extracellular domain may also comprise a signal peptide. In some embodiments of the invention the antigen binding domain of a CAR binds a hapten that is coupled to a polypeptide (\u201chaptenylated\u201d or \u201ctagged\u201d polypeptide), wherein the polypeptide may bind to a disease-associated antigen such as an autoantigen or an antigen derived from harmless exogenous substances, e.g. microbiota, airborne particles, such as plant pollen, fungal spores. Such a CAR may be also named \u201canti-tag\u201d CAR as disclosed e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 9,233,125B2. In other embodiments of the invention, the extracellular part of the CAR may comprise a linker/label epitope (LLE) binding domain as antigen binding domain that binds to a linker/label epitope (LLE) that is part of a TCBM. Such a CAR may be named anti-LLE CAR as disclosed in the European patent application no. EP16196487.9. Both types of CARs are universal and/or adaptable CAR.

In other embodiments of the invention the antigen binding domain of the CAR binds to a soluble antigen as disclosed herein.",

The CARs of the invention may comprise one or more antigen binding domains. Generally, the targeting regions on the CAR are extracellular. The antigen binding domain may comprise an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof. The antigen binding domain may comprise, for example, full length heavy chain, Fab fragments, single chain Fv (scFv) fragments, divalent single chain antibodies or diabodies. Any molecule that binds specifically to a given antigen such as affibodies or ligand binding domains from naturally occurring receptors may be used as an antigen binding domain. Often the antigen binding domain is a scFv. Normally, in a scFv the variable regions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain are fused by a flexible linker to form a scFv. Such a linker may be for example the \u201c(G4/S)3-linker\u201d.",

The spacer may include e.g. Fc fragments of antibodies or fragments thereof, hinge regions of antibodies or fragments thereof, CH2 or CH3 regions of antibodies, accessory proteins, artificial spacer sequences or combinations thereof. A prominent example of a spacer is the CD8alpha hinge. The transmembrane domain of the CAR may be derived from any desired natural or synthetic source for such domain. When the source is natural the domain may be derived from any membrane-bound or transmembrane protein. The transmembrane domain may be derived for example from CD8alpha or CD28. When the key signaling and antigen recognition modules (domains) are on two (or even more) polypeptides then the CAR may have two (or more) transmembrane domains. The splitting key signaling and antigen recognition modules enable for a small molecule-dependent, titratable and reversible control over CAR cell expression (Wu et al, 2015, Science 350: 293-303) due to small molecule-dependent heterodimerizing domains in each polypeptide of the CAR.",

The intracellular signaling domain refers to the part of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell expressing the CAR to perform a specialized function. The intracellular signaling domain may include any complete, mutated or truncated part of the intracellular signaling domain of a given protein sufficient to transduce a signal which initiates or blocks immune cell effector functions.",

Therefore, an intracellular signaling domain of a CAR may comprise one or more primary cytoplasmic signaling domains and/or one or more secondary cytoplasmic signaling domains.",
