## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Optimal Microneedle Geometries for Extracting IF In-Vivo while Minimizing Discomfort

### Identification of Stress/Fatigue Biomarkers that are Extractable from IF Using Microneedles and Correlation of Interstitial Levels with Known, Clinically-Relevant Blood/Plasma Levels that are Indicative of Metabolic Stress or Fatigue

### Sensing Transducers to Monitor IF Biomarkers and Assess Levels of Biomarkers in Human Subjects Undergoing Physical Exertion with Focus on Lactate as a Model
