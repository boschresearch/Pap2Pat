    "abstract": "Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is an underutilized information-rich biofluid potentially useful in health status monitoring applications whose contents remain challenging to characterize. Here, we present a facile microneedle approach for dermal ISF extraction with minimal pain and no blistering for human subjects and rats. Extracted ISF volumes were sufficient for determining transcriptome, and proteome signatures. We noted similar profiles in ISF, serum, and plasma samples, suggesting that ISF can be a proxy for direct blood sampling. Dynamic changes in RNA-seq were recorded in ISF from induced hypoxia conditions. Finally, we report the first isolation and characterization, to our knowledge, of exosomes from dermal ISF. The ISF exosome concentration is 12-13 times more enriched when compared to plasma and serum and represents a previously unexplored biofluid for exosome isolation. This minimally invasive extraction approach can enable mechanistic studies of ISF and demonstrates the potential of ISF for real-time health monitoring applications.",

                "Standard clinical testing typically involves collecting biological fluid samples such as blood, urine, sweat, saliva, and sputum for laboratory analysis1. With the growing need for non-invasive sampling and real-time physiological monitoring, interest in exploring the skin as a reservoir of information has grown in recent years2\u20134. Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) holds promise as a potentially rich and accessible source of information, but minimally invasive collection of ISF has proved challenging. Additionally, there is a paucity of knowledge on the presence of useful physiological markers in ISF.",
                "Numerous publications have attempted to elucidate the biomolecular content of dermal ISF without wide agreement on contents, particularly with respect to protein markers5\u20139. Many of these used extraction methods (i.e. suction blister, effusion, dialysis, or sonication) that alter the composition of ISF, due to the local trauma caused by the extraction process. For instance, the suction blister fluid (SBF) method likely causes extensive cell lysis, destabilization of the stratum corneum, and separation of the dermal layers10. Additionally, previously reported extraction methods do not appear to be compatible with practical real-time monitoring of physiological changes with the exception of glucose monitoring such as the GlucoWatch Biographer, which uses reverse iontophoresis to extract glucose from the skin.",
                "Microneedle-enabled ISF extraction has been proposed for minimally invasive monitoring and diagnostic applications11. While microneedles provide very precise skin penetration, extraction of sufficient ISF (10\u201320\u2009\u00b5l) for transcriptomic or proteomic analysis has not been reported12\u201314 (http://www.rsc.org/images/LOC/2015/PDFs/Papers/0912_W.201c.pdf)15. Herein, we report a facile method that uses an array of hollow microneedles to extract large quantities (up to 20\u2009\u00b5l and 60 microliters from humans and rats, respectively) of dermal ISF, with no need for blistering of the skin and uses widely available materials for easy construction. We extract ISF volumes sufficient for common downstream analyses, such as transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, and exosome isolation. Exosomes are increasingly being shown to be effective for liquid biopsy applications, however, their isolation from blood is difficult due to its complicated matrix making ISF an intriguing substitute. Additionally, we find that dermal ISF possesses transcriptomic and proteomic content highly similar to serum and plasma. ISF could therefore constitute an informative proxy for blood in health monitoring, and microneedle-enabled sampling could advance wearable, real-time sensing devices."

                        "Microneedle insertion and ISF extraction is complicated by the dynamic properties and elasticity of skin. Stretching and tenting of skin impedes the placement of single and arrayed microneedles16,17. After skin puncture, dermal compaction around the microneedle insertion site is believed to increase fluidic resistance in drug delivery studies. Wang et al. showed that reducing the amount of dermal compaction results in higher flow rates during drug delivery18. Many groups have attempted ISF collection with microneedles, but limited volumes (<2\u2009\u00b5l) were collected, limiting characterization and analysis12\u201314 (http://www.rsc.org/images/LOC/2015/PDFs/Papers/0912_W.201c.pdf)19,49. We present a needle substrate that minimize dermal compaction at insertion site(s), allowing extraction of higher ISF volumes.",
                        "Traditional needle substrates are almost exclusively flat planar projections (Fig.\u00a01a). We believe this planar arrangement causes tissue compaction and displacement of ISF from the skin, which can contain 15\u201340% ISF by volume depending on the layer20. To test this hypothesis, we created an alternative needle substrate that creates a concentric opening about the microneedle (Fig.\u00a01b), such that the skin surrounding the needle was not compressed and that also results in an inherent pumping mechanism for ISF extraction.Fig. 1Microneedle configurations. Planar (a) and cylinder concentric (b) microneedle substrates"

                        "Microneedles were created from Single BD 32\u2009G 4\u2009mm Ultra-Fine Pen needles (Becton Dickinson) using a CO2 laser cutter with a three-axis stage to cut the protective plastic housing and precisely control needle lengths (Supplementary Figure\u00a01). The cutting of the housing produces a concentric opening around the microneedle when pressed to skin. A glass capillary was then attached to the backing of the microneedle (Fig.\u00a02a) for ISF collection. After application a 30\u2013120\u2009s lag time was observed for ISF flow to enter the capillary that would continue for 10\u201315\u2009min, on average. Figure 2b shows collected ISF inside the capillary after removal from the microneedle. The extracted fluid was colorless (no red blood cells) while visible microscope analysis and electron microscopy staining showed no cellular components that would indicate the presence of excess tissue from insertion damage. It is important to note that the flow of fluid into the glass capillary is not attributed to capillary action. No wicking of liquid into the needle/capillary sets occurred when placed into deionized water control droplets. Abe et al. previously characterized the same commercial pen needle system, and noted that hydrophobicity of the inner bore was slightly decreased by cleaning with UV-ozone21, however in our experience, this cleaning step was not sufficient to induce capillary flow. Therefore, we attribute the ISF flow to the local pressure induced from ring edges at tissue surrounding the insertion point from the unique concentric microneedle opening geometry. In contrast to other methods used to collect dermal interstitial fluid (i.e. blister and dialysis), no separate instrumentation is required (i.e. vacuum pump).Fig. 2Microneedle assembly and arrays. a Single microneedle (length of 1500\u2009\u00b5m) within polymer housing with glass capillary collection tube. b Glass capillary collection tube with ISF collected from a human subject using a 1500\u2009\u00b5m microneedle length. c 3D printed microneedle holder for 1500\u2009\u00b5m needle length; inner diameter of concentric ring surrounding microneedles are ~2.8\u2009mm. d Two 3D microneedle holders adhered to a human subject for ISF extraction and collection in glass capillary tubes.

                        "Three different microneedle lengths (1000\u2009\u00b5m, 1500\u2009\u00b5m, and 2000 \u00b5m) were initially studied for their ability to extract fluid from a human forearm with minimal pain response. In this pilot study, ISF extraction was successful in four of seven human subjects. Fluid was extracted with each microneedle length, with 1500\u2009\u00b5m needles eliciting a higher percentage of extraction success compared to the other lengths (31% vs. 14 and 16%, respectively); average total volume was 1.51\u2009\u00b5l for single microneedles (n\u2009=\u200910). For each needle length, we recorded pain scores on insertion (pain scale of 0\u201310 with 0 indicating absence of pain). Scores of 0.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0, 0.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49, and 0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.11 were reported for the 1000\u2009\u00b5m, 1500\u2009\u00b5m, and 2000 \u00b5m microneedle lengths, respectively. A length of 1500\u2009\u00b5m was therefore selected for subsequent studies of arrayed microneedles. Histology of excised rat skin to determine tissue penetration depths was attempted but ultimately inconclusive. The insulin delivery PEN needles used are pre-coated with a silicone lubricant and have an engineered five grind bevel tip geometry to reduce insertion penetration force, and limit pain response which likely contribute to the inability of effectively imaging the excised tissues for damage. We also believe that these same design properties, engineered to minimize tissue trauma, also preclude rupturing of capillaries which allowed extraction of ISF with no blood contamination for tested needle lengths up to 1500\u2009\u00b5m.",
                        "Arrays were then fabricated to increase extraction volumes of ISF. Each array was 3D printed to contain up to five needles in parallel while maintaining the open concentric design at the base of each needle (Fig.\u00a02c and d). Using the 5-microneedle arrays, up to 16\u2009\u00b5l of ISF was extracted in 1\u20132-h periods in human subjects. This represents a 4\u20135 increase in extraction efficiency over previous attempts which report on average ~1\u2009\u00b5l for 30\u2009min of extraction12\u201314 (http://www.rsc.org/images/LOC/2015/PDFs/Papers/0912_W.201c.pdf)15. Overall the success rate of ISF extraction was 92.9%, and more than 10\u2009\u00b5l was extracted in 64% of subjects (n\u2009=\u200914). No observed blockage of the needle pores was observed visually after removal, and needles remained open to fluid flow with syringe testing. Further arrangements of needle density and spacings have not been attempted.",
                        "Participants were asked to score the pain at array insertion, after placement for 5\u201310\u2009min., and upon removal of the arrays. Scores of 1.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75, 0.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70, and 0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27 were reported for the start, middle, and end of the procedure, respectively (n\u2009=\u200914). No bruising of the skin or other adverse events were witnessed by investigators or disclosed by participants."

                        "Exosomes are recently described, cell-derived vesicles containing high concentrations of proteins and nucleic acid22,23. Exosomes appear to play important roles in intercellular signaling, and contain clinically relevant biomarkers for cancer and other illnesses23\u201325. We report here the first description to our knowledge of exosome content in dermal ISF, to our knowledge. Exosomes from rat and human ISF and serum were isolated using standard exosome isolation kits from Invitrogen and visualized using TEM (Fig.\u00a03). Using ImageJ Software25, exosome diameters purified from rat and human ISF were 140.4\u2009\u00b1\u200974.8\u2009nm and 101.2\u2009\u00b1\u200943.9\u2009nm, respectively, while exosomes purified from rat and human serum had diameters of 105.5\u2009\u00b1\u200942.0\u2009nm and 103.2\u2009\u00b1\u200937.2\u2009nm, respectively. Measured exosomes diameters agree with those established in the literature (30\u2013150\u2009nm)23\u201327. Using a nanoDrop spectrophotometer, we quantified the protein equivalent of purified exosome preparations from the ISF and serum of rats and humans. We found that, in rats, there were 1643\u2009\u00b5g per ml and 122\u2009\u00b5g per ml protein equivalents of exosomes in ISF and serum, respectively (Fig.\u00a03c). In a human subject, spectrophotometric analysis revealed that there were 2,786\u2009\u00b5g per ml and 228\u2009\u00b5g per ml protein equivalents of exosomes in ISF and serum, respectively (Fig.\u00a03c). Interestingly, both rat and human ISF was found to be highly enriched for exosomes, with ISF having 12\u201313 times more exosomes (protein equivalents) than serum (Fig.\u00a03f). The size of exosomes limits their ability to cross venous capillaries, thus they are logically surmised to be derived from local tissue mostly (the skin is the largest organ in the human body with a high concentration of immune cells). Slow diffusion rates in the high density of collagen matrix likely contribute to the enriched presence in ISF compared to plasma. Dermal ISF does not benefit from a pumping mechanism (like blood) that induces flow and its clearance is dependent on drainage into the lymphatic system, which should also introduce the exosomes into systemic circulation. Proteomic results (described below) support the conclusion of an enriched exosome presence in ISF. This points to exosomes in dermal ISF as a potentially rich source of biomolecular information previously unexplored.Fig. 3Rat and human characterization. TEM images of rat (a, b) and human (d, e) exosomes purified from ISF (a, d) and serum (b, e). Exosome concentration (protein equivalent) was measured using a nanoDrop spectrophotometer and is shown in (c). The exosome ratio of ISF vs. serum in rat and human samples is shown in (f).

                        "Qualitative and quantitative proteomic comparison of ISF with plasma and serum was studied on three rats by combining a two-dimensional LC/MS analysis with a stable heavy isotopic labeling technique (TMT tags). The analysis resulted in the identification of 1976 protein groups containing a total of 2855 individual proteins. Nearly 100% of the proteins identified in the blood-derived samples of rat #1 were also detected in ISF, and just a couple dozen other proteins (<1%) were specific to ISF as depicted in Fig.\u00a04a. Similar results were observed for two other examined rats (Supplementary Figure\u00a02). Reproducibility of the ISF protein identifications was extremely high for the small sample size used, as demonstrated by the fact that 99.9% proteins were found to be in common among all three rats examined (Fig.\u00a04b).Fig. 4Sample overlap. a Venn diagram demonstrating distribution of 2852 proteins identified in plasma, serum and ISF of rat #1. b Complete ISF proteome distribution of rats 1, 2 and 3, with 99.9% proteins were consistently identified in all three rats",
                        "Nearly all proteins detected in the ISF were also detected in serum and plasma, suggesting that ISF-unique proteins previously detected through profiling of blister-derived ISF may be related to tissue damage or inflammatory response (although a direct comparison to SBF was not done in this study). In a previously reported proteomic study of SBF, Kool et al. demonstrated the content of human SBF was more diverse than serum, with 46% of the 442 proteins identified unique to SBF27. Given our findings, the diversity of SBF proteome could be attributed to protein leakage from tissue proximal to the blister site, due to tissue damage caused by the vacuum force applied during sampling. This also suggests that the ISF collected in our technique is a purer filtrate of plasma. Proteomics on plasma and serum is particularly challenging due to the large dynamic range of proteins within the blood which makes the sampling in ISF more attractive for clinical diagnosis.",
                        "Although the qualitative analysis was identical between ISF proteins and those of plasma and serum, the relative abundance expression of proteins in these fluid types were highly distinctive. A stringent criterion was applied for quantitation, which resulted in 862 proteins that were unambiguously identified and had valid counts of reporter ion intensity in all three replicates of at least one of the three fluids. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of these proteins identified 560 proteins with notable differences in abundance, and ISF was clearly distinguishable from serum and plasma (Fig.\u00a05a). Among the ANOVA significant proteins, 330 proteins (38%) belonged to ISF and were detected at a (+/\u2212) two fold minimum difference in abundance relative to levels in plasma or serum; 29 of these proteins were detected at lower levels in ISF, and 301 at higher levels in ISF (Fig.\u00a05b). A large portion (70%) of the proteins that were detected at higher levels in ISF are known to be associated with the exosome, as determined by annotation enrichment analysis (Supplementary Table\u00a01). This observation is consistent with the finding that exosomes were 12\u201313 times more concentrated in ISF than in serum, as seen in the TEM imaging and exosome concentration measurement section presented in Fig.\u00a03.Fig. 5a Protein quantification and clustering.

Higher expression is red and lower expression is green",
                        "In summary, we find consistent signatures of protein abundance in ISF. The ISF proteome is essentially identical to the serum and plasma proteomes with regard to constituent proteins detected, but characteristically different with regard to the relative abundances of those proteins. The ISF also contains higher concentrations of exosomes than detected in serum and plasma."

In any case, our results indicate that ISF, like serum and plasma, contains a wide variety of potentially informative RNA species; and that the different types of RNA present in ISF are found in roughly the same proportions in serum and plasma.",
                        "Given that protein-coding transcripts comprised the majority of RNA species detected in all of the sample types analyzed, we sought to determine whether the set of transcripts consistently detected in the ISF samples resembled those consistently detected in the serum and plasma samples. For each sample type, only the transcripts detected in all examples of the type (e.g., all four ISF samples) were included in the analysis. We found that a total of 7049 transcripts were detected in all examples of at least one sample type (Fig.\u00a06). Remarkably, 5,314 of these transcripts (75.7%) were detected in all samples analyzed, indicating that most of the transcripts consistently detected in one sample type were also consistently detected in the other sample types. Conversely, we found that few transcripts were consistently detected in one sample type but not in the others. For example, only 219 transcripts (3.1% of the total analyzed) were consistently detected in ISF but not in serum or plasma; 231 (3.3%) were consistently detected in serum only; and 53 (0.8%) were consistently detected in plasma only. In total, only 503 transcripts (7.1%) were consistently detected in only one of the three sample types analyzed. These results indicate that ISF, serum, and plasma share a core transcriptome that includes most of the transcripts consistently detected in the individual sample types. It is also interesting to note that only 312 transcripts (4.4%) were consistently detected in serum and/or plasma but not in ISF, which further suggests that the transcript content of ISF is very similar to serum and plasma.Fig. 6Similarity of RNA species detected in ISF, serum, and plasma samples.

                        "While ISF, serum, and plasma appeared similar with respect to their transcript content, we wondered whether this similarity extended to the relative abundances of their transcripts. As shown in Fig.\u00a07, pairwise comparison of transcript abundances in ISF, serum, and plasma samples drawn from the same rat indicated close correlations in transcript abundances, such that most of the points in each scatter plot roughly followed the diagonal (marked out as a red line), and the R2 value (a measure of overall similarity between transcript abundances) was\u2009\u2265\u20090.90. Comparison of the two plasma samples yielded the highest R2 value (0.93), as expected; but the fact that ISF vs. serum or plasma yielded R2 values of 0.90, comparable to those of serum vs. plasma (0.90\u20130.92), underscored the similarity between ISF, serum, and plasma with respect to both transcript content and relative abundances of transcripts. Analysis of the sample sets from the other three rats supported this conclusion (Supplementary Figure\u00a03, 4 and 5)Fig. 7Pairwise comparison of ISF, serum, and plasma transcriptomes.

While the preceding analyses highlighted the similarity between the ISF, serum, and plasma transcriptomes, the global view provided by PCA, presented in Fig.\u00a08, suggests that the ISF transcriptome is related to, but ultimately distinct from, the serum and plasma transcriptomes, which more closely resemble one another (Fig.\u00a06). We found that the ISF samples loosely clustered together within a horizontal plane (PC2 x PC3); the serum and plasma samples loosely clustered together within a vertical plane (PC1 x PC3); and the two planes intersected and partially overlapped, with the ISF samples from Rats A and D appearing to belong to both clusters/planes. Taken together, our results indicate that in terms of its constituents and their relative abundances, the ISF transcriptome is highly similar to serum and plasma transcriptomes, but the latter two are slightly more closely related to one another.Fig. 8All-against-all comparison of ISF, serum, and plasma transcriptomes. Shown are principal component analysis (PCA) results that indicate the degree to which the samples\u2019 transcriptomes (both content and relative abundances) resemble one another.

Therefore, miRNA changes in ISF vs plasma in rats subjected to acute hypoxia was examined. Acute hypoxia affects individuals exposed to environments with frequent altitude changes, such as mountainous terrain, which can cause physiological alterations affecting pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and hematologic systems, as well as declines in overall performance30\u201332 and health conditions such as heart disease32,33 and tumor microenvironment34,35.",
                        "We used our microneedle technology to extract ISF from three CD Hairless rats exposed to normoxia (21% O2) and three exposed to acute hypoxia (10% O2). We then performed RNA-Seq to identify and enumerate the transcripts present in each ISF sample. Figure\u00a09 shows the average relative abundances of the transcripts most enriched (Fig.\u00a09a) or depleted (Fig.\u00a09b) in ISF collected from rats experiencing hypoxia (10% oxygen), as compared to those experiencing normoxia (21% oxygen). Previous studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as well as chemokines and their receptors, are frequently differentially expressed under conditions of hypoxia, potentially as a mechanism by which leukocyte migration is inhibited, leading to accumulation of leukocytes at hypoxic sites. Consistent with these previous studies, we found that transcripts encoding metalloproteinases (Mmp8, Mmp14/Mt1), chemokines and their receptors, (Cxcl13, Ccr1), and a known regulator of leukocyte migration (Stk10) were enriched in ISF samples collected from rats experiencing hypoxia, as compared to those collected from rats experiencing normoxia (Fig.\u00a09a and Supplementary Table\u00a02). Additionally, we found that transcripts encoding proteins mediating other aspects of innate immunity (Hmgb1-ps3, Lacc1, Bnip1), transcriptional regulation (Mecp2, Sertad2, Tada2b, Tle1), and mitochondrial protein import (Tomm40, Mtx1) were depleted in ISF samples collected from rats experiencing hypoxia (Fig.\u00a07b and Supplementary Table\u00a02). Our results indicate that hypoxia-associated changes to the ISF transcriptome can be readily detected via RNA-Seq, consistent with the idea that the ISF transcriptome may serve as an accessible source of molecular biomarkers that reflect changes in a subject\u2019s physiological or disease state36,37.Fig. 9Protein-coding transcript quantification. Protein-coding transcripts enriched (a) and depleted (b) in the ISF of hypoxic (10% O2, red), as compared to normoxic (21% O2, gray), rats. The relative abundance of each transcript was measured in each of three rats per oxygen condition (six measurements per transcript in total, represented as three red and three gray data points). For each transcript, the mean of its relative abundance in the three hypoxic rats is indicated by a red bar; and the mean of its relative abundance in the three normoxic rats is indicated by a gray bar. For all of the transcripts shown, the difference in means is significant by Student\u2019s t-test (p\u2009<\u20090.05)"

                "In conclusion, we describe a microneedle-based extraction method for ISF fluid in both single and microneedle array formats in both humans and rats. The technique causes minimal discomfort in human subjects and uses materials widely available to average laboratories without expensive or complicated instruments. Analysis of the extracted fluid was performed for transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures. We noted similar transcriptomic and proteomic signature profiles between ISF, serum, and plasma as well as dynamic responses of RNA-seq under hypoxia-induced conditions showing utility of ISF as a blood proxy for clinical diagnosis. Differences between ISF and blood fraction signatures noted in previous reports is likely due to localized trauma and inflammation inherent to prior ISF collection methods. We also demonstrate that dermal ISF is significantly enriched with exosomes compared to serum or plasma.",
                "Overall, this work supports ISF sampling as a minimally invasive alternative to blood fraction analysis. It also introduces a new tool for monitoring of the dermal interstitium, allowing for further characterization of skin physiology and pathophysiology. Finally, this microneedle array prototype can be further matured and serve as the foundation for developing real-time wearable sensing technologies."

Eluent was collected in four \u2018beginning\u2019 fractions of 2\u2009min44, then 84 fractions of 0.5\u2009min, and 5 \u2018end\u2019 fractions of 2\u2009min. Both the beginning and end fractions were pooled into two separate fractions. The 84 fractions were concatenated into 28 fractions making for a total of 30 fractions to be analyzed. Each fraction was speedvac to dryness and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until mass spectrometric analysis."
