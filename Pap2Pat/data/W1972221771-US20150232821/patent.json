                        "PCR is one of the most widely used nucleic acid detection methods. It has various applications in the fields of research and molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Among the many applications, blood-based PCR diagnoses are particularly ire demand.",
                        "On the one hand, the blood is a vital part of the circulatory system for the human body. It includes many types of host cells, including normal cells, diseased cells (e.g., circulating tumor cells), and, if the host is a pregnant mother, fetal cells, as well as genetic materials from such cells, such as microRNAs. Indeed, due to the minimum invasive nature, blood-based PCR is advantageous in some situations such as foetal diagnosis using a maternal blood sample without the risk of abortion associated with conventional amniotic fluid tests. Under certain circumstances, the blood also contains pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Accordingly, blood-based diagnoses can provide an immediate picture of what is happening in the human body at any given time. On the other hand, blood is the source for various pharmaceutical and blood products (e.g., whole blood, plasma, antibodies, and stem cells) that are used to improve the quality of life and to save lives in a variety of traumatic or pathological situations. These therapeutic uses of blood, plasma, and other blood-derived materials require that donations of these materials be as free as possible from contamination of diseased cells (e.g., tumor cells) or pathogens (e.g., HIV, HBV, and HCV). See, e.g., US Applications 20130316925, 20130157253, 20120329061, 20120070827, 20120034614, 20070281307, and 20070105121.",
                        "However, blood-based PCR diagnoses have been limited by a number of logistic and technical challenges. The challenges associated with nucleic acid diagnostics from biological samples are many folds. Complex biological samples, such as blood and cell lysates, have various components that can inhibit DNA polymerases used in PCR reactions. These components include hemoglobin, immunoglobulin G, lactoferrin, and proteases in blood. Although various procedures have been developed to purify samples before attempting PCR reactions, these steps are generally time-consuming, labor-intensive, and might not achieve the purification required for the subsequent PCR. In addition, nucleic acid-containing cells (e.g., white blood cells and fetal cells) account for only a small fraction of a blood sample, precious nucleic acid can be lost from the sample before the PCR reaction step.",
                        "When working with blood, one key point is that a blood sample should be collected in anticoagulants to prevent clotting since isolation of nucleic acids from clotted blood is not efficient and most of the cells will be lost in the clot. However, anticoagulants routinely used in blood sample collection, such as EDTA and heparin, interfere with or inhibit PCR. For example, heparin is highly negatively charged and will co-extract with DNA and thereby inhibit PCR reactions. See e.g., Garcia et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. April 2002 vol. 40 no. 4 1567-1568, and Yokota et al., Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis, Volume 13, Issue 3, pages 133-140, 1999.",
                        "Thus, there is a need for reagents, such as DNA polymerases, that are more resistant to the above-mentioned inhibitors and suitable for PCR reactions using blood samples."

                        "This invention relates to thermostable Type A DNA polymerase mutants that have increased resistance to inhibitors in whole blood, which include natural components of blood (hemoglobin in erythrocytes, lactoferrin in leukocytes) or plasma (immunoglobulin G), or added anticoagulants, such as EDTA and heparin.",
                        "Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides an isolated, mutant thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase. The mutant polymerase comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a first mutation at residue 507 of a wild-type Taq DNA polymerase (SEQ ID NO: 4) or at a residue corresponding to residue 507 of the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase in another thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase; and additional mutations at residues 59, 155, 245, and 749 of the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase, or at corresponding residues in the another thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase. The mutant polymerase possesses (i) DNA polymerase activity and (ii) a higher resistance to a polymerization activity inhibitor (e.g., natural components of blood or anticoagulants such as EDTA or heparin) than the wild-type DNA polymerase from which it is derived. The mutant polymerase is free of mutation at residue 375 or 734 of the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase, or at corresponding residues in the another thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase. The mutant can also possess a faster polymerization rate as compared with the wild-type DNA polymerase.",
                        "In some embodiments, the wild-type Type-A DNA polymerase comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-10. The mutant DNA polymerase is at least 70% (e.g., 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99%) identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-10. In one example, the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4. In other words, the mutant polymerase is a mutant Taq DNA polymerase.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the first mutation in the mutant is an E507K mutation based on the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4. In a more preferred embodiment, the mutant contains the following five mutations: G59W, V1551, L245M, E507K, and F749I. For example, the mutant can be one comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11. In other embodiments, the mutant can be a DNA polymerase that has the above-described five mutations and is at least 70% (e.g., 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99%) identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11.",
                        "The invention further provides a composition (e.g., a master mix for PCR reactions) comprising (i) the mutant DNA polymerase described above and (ii) one or more reagents selected from the group consisting of an aqueous buffer, a divalent metal (e.g., magnesium), extension nucleotides, primers, a detergent, a detection agent (e.g., specific or non-specific dyes or fluorescent molecules), and a target nucleic acid template. Also provided is a kit containing the mutant DNA polymerase or composition described above, and packaging materials therefor. The kit can include one or more reagents selected from the group consisting of an aqueous buffer, a divalent metal, an extension nucleotide, a primer, a probe, a detergent, a detection agent, a dye, a fluorescent molecule, an anticoagulant, and a cell lysis agent.",
                        "The above-described mutant DNA polymerase can be used in a method of primer-extending or a method of amplifying a target nucleic acid. The method includes the steps of: providing a test sample (e.g., a blood sample) suspected of containing the target nucleic acid; contacting the test sample with the mutant polymerase, a primer that specifically binds or hybridizes to a strand of the target nucleic acid, and extension nucleotides to form a mixture; and incubating the mixture under conditions permitting extension of the primer by the polymerase using the sequence of the target nucleic acid as a template for incorporation of the extension nucleotides. The method can be a method of PCR, and in that case, a second primer that specifically binds or hybridizes to the complement of the target nucleic acid strand mentioned above can be used. The test sample can be a blood sample, which can account for at least 1% (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50%) v/v of the mixture.",
                        "The above-described mutant DNA polymerases, compositions (e.g., master mixes for PCR reactions), and methods are particularly useful for blood sample-based PCR reactions. For example, they can be used for real-time PCR from whole blood spotted on Guthrie cards (with no anticoagulants) or from plasma, which is made from whole blood treated with anticoagulants by removing cells by centrifugation. In this application, the whole blood samples can be partially purified (by attachment to Guthrie cards or by centrifugation to remove red blood cells) to remove heme and other factors that quench florescence detection.",
                        "Another aspect of this invention provides an isolated nucleic acid that encodes the above-mentioned mutant DNA polymerase polypeptide. The nucleic acid can contain a sequence that is at least 70% (e.g., 80, 85, 90, 95, or 99%) identical to SEQ ID NO: 12. The invention also provides a vector, such as an expression vector, comprising the nucleic acid and a host cell comprising the nucleic acid. The nucleic acid, vector, and host cell can be used for producing a mutant DNA polymerase polypeptide of this invention. Accordingly, this invention also provides a method for producing the polypeptide. The method includes culturing the host cell in a medium under conditions permitting expression of a polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid, and purifying the polypeptide from the cultured cell or the medium of the cell.",

                                "As disclosed herein, the engineered DNA polymerases of the invention are resistant to one or more inhibitors of a particular DNA polymerase. More specifically, a DNA polymerase according to this aspect of the present invention comprises at least one mutation, as compared to the wild-type DNA polymerase from which it derives, that allows for acceptable levels of DNA polymerization or correct amplification of a desired product during PCR in the presence of one or more inhibitors that reduce the polymerization rate of the wild-type DNA polymerase to a level that does not permit successful product formation in a PCR reaction. Any assay known in the art for determining polymerase activity and/or product formation can be used, for example, an assay as described in the examples below.",
                                "The DNA polymerases of this aspect of the invention typically have (i) a first mutation at residue 507 of SEQ ID NO: 4 (a wild-type Thermus aquaticus Taq DNA polymerase) or at a residue corresponding to residue 507 of the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase in another thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase; and (ii) additional mutations at residues 59, 155, 245, and 749 of the wild-type Taq DNA polymerase, or at corresponding residues in the another thermostable Type-A DNA polymerase. FIG. 1 lists ten examples of such a wild-type DNA polymerase and an alignment of their primary amino acid sequences. Residues corresponding to 59, 155, 245, 507, and 749 of SEQ ID NO: 4 in each polymerase can be located in FIG. 1. In exemplary embodiments, the following mutations are present in the Taq DNA polymerase, or at residues corresponding to these residues at G59W, V1551, L245M, E507K, and F749I of SEQ ID NO: 4. Shown below are the amino acid sequence of one exemplary mutant, Taq 1C2, where the five mutations are underlined, and its coding sequence (SEQ ID NOs 11 and 12, respectively):",
                                "The DNA polymerases of this aspect of the invention are more resistant to blood treated with heparin or EDTA than their wild-type counterparts. The DNA polymerases can also be more resistant to other inhibitors of Taq DNA polymerase. Examples of these other inhibitors include whole blood (with or without anticoagulants), fractions of whole blood (such as those collected using Guthrie card spots), or components of blood, such as blood plasma, hemoglobin, heme, immunoglobulin G, and lactoferrin; cell lysates, such as ones containing inhibitory concentrations of polysaccharides; plant substances, such as pectin, xylan, and acidic polysaccharides; substances found in soil samples, such as humic acid, fulvic acid, and metal ions, including heavy metals and heavy metal ions; and certain organic solvents. Additional non-limiting examples of the inhibitors include urea, organic and phenolic compounds (e.g., phenol), glycogen, fats, calcium, cellulose, nitrocellulose, mineral oil, pollen, glove powder, SDS, and detergents. Various other inhibitors are known in the art, including without limitation those discussed in Kermekchiev, et al., \u201cMutants of Taq DNA polymerase resistant to PCR inhibitors allow DNA amplification from whole blood and crude soil samples\u201d, Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 1, p. 14, 2008; and Abu Al-Soud, W., et al., \u201cCapacity of Nine Thermostable DNA Polymerases To Mediate DNA Amplification in the Presence of PCR-Inhibiting Samples\u201d, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Vol. 64, No. 10, October 1998. As the analysis of blood samples from a subject is of importance in medical and forensic analyses, resistance to inhibitors found in blood or blood fractions, including inhibitors that are commonly added to blood to stabilize it and prevent coagulation (e.g., EDTA and/or heparin) is a characteristic of the mutant enzymes according to this invention.",

Such polymerases thus are capable of polymerizing a nucleic acid strand from a primed DNA template at an increased rate even in the presence of substances that are widely known to be inhibitory to the polymerization rate of the wild-type DNA polymerase.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d is used interchangeably with \u201cmutant\u201d to indicate a protein or nucleic acid that has been altered in its sequence from the wild-type sequence to include an amino acid residue or nucleotide that is different from the corresponding residue or nucleotide in the wild-type protein or nucleic acid, respectively, from which it is derived. Mutants according to the invention thus include site-directed mutants in which specific residues have been intentionally changed, including deletions of one or more residues; insertions of one or more residues, and replacement of one or more residues of one Type-A DNA polymerase with an exogenous sequence, such as a corresponding sequence of another Type-A DNA polymerase. In situations where a replacement/substitution of one or very few residues is made to create a mutant, it is a straightforward matter to identify the DNA polymerase \u201cfrom which the mutant is derived.\u201d However, in situations where regions of sequences are replaced by other regions of sequences, it is sufficient to understand that the mutant can be considered \u201cderived\u201d from either/any of the wild-type thermostable Type-A DNA polymerases from which sequences of the mutant show identity, particularly any one of the exemplary wild-type DNA polymerases shown below in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NOs: 1-10).",

However, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments discussed in detail below. For example, the invention includes mutants of polymerases other than Taq DNA polymerase, such as mutants of any thermostable Type-A family DNA polymerase. These mutants can be mutants of the polymerases, including but not limited to those, from species of Thermus or Thermatoga. It is well documented and well understood by those of skill in the art that thermostable Type-A DNA polymerases show high levels of sequence identity and conservation. Thus, it is a simple matter for one of skill in the art to identify residues of one particular Type-A DNA polymerase that correspond to residues of another. Thus, reference herein to specific mutations in wild-type Taq DNA polymerase can easily be correlated to corresponding mutations in other polymerases.",
                                "FIG. 1 presents an alignment of the primary amino acid sequences of several non-limiting exemplary thermostable Type-A DNA polymerases. As shown in FIG. 1, various regions of thermostable Type-A DNA polymerases are highly conserved while other regions are variable. Those of skill in the art will immediately recognize and understand that mutations in addition to those specifically identified and discussed herein may be made in the variable regions of Type-A DNA polymerases without altering, or without substantially altering, the polymerase activity of the mutated enzyme. Likewise, conservative mutations at conserved residues may be made without altering, or substantially altering, the polymerase activity of the mutated enzyme. Mutating enzymes based on comparative structure analysis with other related enzymes is a common and useful technique in the molecular biology field that allows a person of skill to reasonably predict the effect of a given mutation on the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Using the structural data and known physical properties of amino acids, those of skill in the art can mutate enzymes, such as the DNA polymerases encompassed by the present invention, without altering, or without substantially altering, the essential enzymatic characteristics of the enzymes.",

The polypeptide can constitute at least 10% (i.e., any percentage between 10% and 100% inclusive, e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%) by dry weight of the purified preparation. Purity can be measured by any appropriate standard method, for example, by column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or HPLC analysis.

                                "The amino acid composition of the above-mentioned DNA polymerase peptide/polypeptide/protein may vary without disrupting the ability to catalyze the replication of DNA under primer extension reaction conditions and/or PCR reaction conditions as described herein in the presence of EDTA- or heparin-treated blood. For example, it can contain one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), \u03b2-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in the above-mentioned sequences, such as SEQ ID NO: 11, is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the sequences, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for the ability to catalyze the replication of DNA under PCR conditions described herein to identify mutants that retain the activity as descried below in, e.g., US 20110027833.",

In exemplary embodiments, the conditions that allow polymerization of nucleic acids from the primer(s) are conditions for a PCR reaction. As will be recognized by those of skill in the art, the step of exposing the substances to conditions for polymerization can be considered as a step of polymerizing, such as a step of amplifying a nucleic acid template.",
                                "The polymerases are advantageously used in any variation or type of PCR reaction for amplification of nucleic acids, including both DNA and RNA amplifications. For amplification of RNA templates (e.g., mRNAs or microRNAs), an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (e.g., a reverse transcriptase; RT) can be used to make a DNA strand complementary to the RNA template, and a DNA polymerase of the invention can be used to amplify the DNA complementary strand.",
                                "In some exemplary embodiments, the PCR method is conducted on \u201cdirty\u201d samples, such as blood. In general, as used herein, a \u201cdirty\u201d sample is one that includes undefined substances, typically present originally in the environment where the target nucleic acid was present. Thus, a dirty sample in general is a sample in which the target nucleic acid was not purified prior to inclusion in the polymerization reaction.",
                                "Accordingly, the polymerase mutants and related methods can be used in various ways. For examples, they can be used for detecting blood infections at an early stage of infection with a pathogen and more particularly for detecting pathogens at low concentrations in circulation from a volume of blood from a subject (e.g., a patient) or in a biological product. Examples of such pathogens include fungi, bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and H. pylori) and viruses (e.g., HIV, HBV, and HCV). They also can be used for detecting genetic mutations, markers or polymorphisms (e.g., Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) associated with cancer or genetic disorders. Furthermore, they can be used for analysis of rare cells, such as foetal cells in a maternal blood sample or micrometastatic tumor cells, the detection of which is often complicated by the low abundance of such cells and because the biological sample often will comprise a majority of other cells or tissue material besides the rare cell of interest. The ability to analyze rare cells and other biological material of limited availability allows the development of new diagnostic methods with a less invasive character. See, e.g., US Applications 20130316925, 20130157253, 20120329061, 20120070827, 20120034614, 20070281307, 20070105121, 20050009108, and 20020155519. All of these references are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.",
                                "Due to their increased polymerization rate, the polymerase enzymes of the present invention are also well suited for \u201cfast PCR\u201d reactions, such as those described in, e.g., US20110027833, the content of which is incorporated by reference. Further, due to their resistance to inhibitors found in blood and blood products, they are particularly well suited for \u201cfast PCR\u201d reactions in samples that contain blood or fractions of blood. Preferably, they are well suited for \u201cfast PCR\u201d reactions in \u201cdirty\u201d samples, such as those containing blood or fractions of blood that have been treated with anticoagulants such as EDTA and heparin.",
                                "In some embodiments, two or more primers having different sequences are used in the method. For example, in some embodiments two primers are used, where one primer specifically binds to one strand of the template DNA and the other binds to the other strand of the template DNA, allowing for production of a double-stranded polymerization product. In some embodiments, one primer is specific for a sequence present on a single-stranded RNA template, such as an mRNA. Polymerization of a first complementary strand of the RNA from the first primer provides a template for the second primer. Subsequent to a first polymerization, the first primer can prime polymerization from either the template RNA or the DNA complement. One or more nucleic acid probes having sequence specificity for the target nucleic acid (including a complementary strand of the target, where the target is single-stranded) can be included in the method to provide a means for detection.",
                                "Many PCR methods include probes, dyes, or other substances that allow for detection of polymerization (e.g., amplification) products. One example of such methods is Real-Time PCR. Accordingly, the method can include a step of including in the polymerization reaction a substance that allows for detection of polymerization products. Furthermore, the method of the invention encompasses methods that include one or more control reactions to determine if the methods, or particular method steps, have been performed successfully. The control reactions can be positive control reactions or negative control reactions. Those of skill in the art are fully capable of devising appropriate control reaction conditions without the need for particular steps to be detailed herein."

Amplification of a given template can result in the generation of a population of polynucleotide amplification products, collectively referred to as an \u201camplicon.\u201d The polynucleotides of the amplicon can be single stranded or double stranded, or a mixture of both. Typically, the template will include a target sequence, and the resulting amplicon will include polynucleotides having a sequence that is either substantially identical or substantially complementary to the target sequence. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of a particular amplicon are substantially identical, or substantially complementary, to each other; alternatively, in some embodiments the polynucleotides within a given amplicon can have nucleotide sequences that vary from each other. Amplification can proceed in linear or exponential fashion, and can involve repeated and consecutive replications of a given template to form two or more amplification products. Some typical amplification reactions involve successive and repeated cycles of template-based nucleic acid synthesis, resulting in the formation of a plurality of daughter polynucleotides containing at least some portion of the nucleotide sequence of the template and sharing at least some degree of nucleotide sequence identity (or complementarity) with the template. In some embodiments, each instance of nucleic acid synthesis, which can be referred to as a \u201ccycle\u201d of amplification, includes creating free 3\u2032 end (e.g., by nicking one strand of a dsDNA) thereby generating a primer and primer extension steps; optionally, an additional denaturation step can also be included wherein the template is partially or completely denatured. In some embodiments, one round of amplification includes a given number of repetitions of a single cycle of amplification. For example, a round of amplification can include 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 75, 100 or more repetitions of a particular cycle. In one exemplary embodiment, amplification includes any reaction wherein a particular polynucleotide template is subjected to two consecutive cycles of nucleic acid synthesis.
