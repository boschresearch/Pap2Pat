Bone marrow biopsy cores are rich in data concerning the state of a bone disease. However, little is known about how to correlate observed morphological features in bone marrow biopsy data with clinical course of a bone disease such as multiple myeloma with respect to the development of skeletal-related events or the response to a treatment. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to spatial relationships observed amongst plasma cells, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and stromal cells in bone marrow biopsy data. These and other shortcomings are addressed by the present disclosure."

FIG. 15 and FIG. 16 illustrate computational results for the level set function (3) for normal bone remodeling in one remodeling cycle. Parameters are the same as the level set function (2), with the replacement of scaling constants with \u03ba1=0.0748, and \u03ba2=0.0006395. Specifically, FIG. 15 illustrates aggregation across space of the dynamics under normal bone remodeling (r11=r12=r21=r22=0) of the spatially explicit model. FIG. 16 illustrates bone and bone marrow interface snapshots in time in the case of normal bone remodeling. FIG. 16 begins with an idealized circular geometry for the bone and bone marrow interface (the interior of the circle is trabecular bone). After an area of bone is resorbed and reformed, the bone and bone marrow interface returns to its original shape, absent of anything that would indicate an osteolytic lesion.",

Specifically, FIG. 17 illustrates aggregation across space of the dynamics under multiple myeloma dysregulated bone remodeling (r11=0.005, r12=0, r21=0, r22=0.2) of the spatially explicit model. FIG. 18 illustrates bone and bone marrow interface snapshots in time in the case of multiple myeloma dysregulated bone remodeling. FIG. 18 begins with an idealized circular geometry for the bone and bone marrow interface (the interior of the circle is trabecular bone). The effects of multiple myeloma can manifest themselves as a net loss of bone mass at the remodeling site over a remodeling cycle. The section of remodeled bone is not fully restored and development of an osteolytic lesion can be seen.",
                        "In an aspect, using an idealized geometry for the set level set function (3) can help visualize the formation of an osteolytic lesion more clearly than using a more complicated geometry. The use of an idealized circular geometry can show clearly the formation of an osteolytic lesion in computations with tumor load (FIG. 18), and the absence of such lesions in the case of normal bone remodeling (FIG. 17). In an aspect, actual geometries can be used to replace an idealized circular geometry.",

In an aspect, information obtained in step 1410 can provide insight into the pathological relationship between tumor cells and the sounding bone marrow environment, and improved understanding of morbidity of a bone disease. As an example, bisphosphonate therapy is used to treat multiple myeloma. In an aspect, bisphosphonate therapy can inhibit osteoclast activity and decrease the incidence of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma. However, bisphosphonate therapy can have a variety of side effects. In an aspect, information obtained in step 1410 can allow physicians to identify patients with varying degrees of derangement in bone remodeling, thereby determined whether an immediate treatment with bisphosphonate therapy is needed for a patient and when to initiate bisphosphonate therapy. As another example, information obtained in step 1410 can also be used to determine when to terminate a bisphosphonate therapy based on evidence of increasing derangement in bone homeostasis despite continued bisphosphonate use, thereby decreasing the risk of adverse side effects.",

In an aspect, determining the bone marrow interface can comprise determining one or more of area of marrow space, area of mineralized bone, area of bone, area of cartilage, area of interstitial fluid, and boundaries of trabeculae. For example, morphological and cellular features associated with marrow space, area of mineralized bone, area of bone, area of cartilage, area of interstitial fluid, and boundaries of trabeculae can be identified and quantified in one or more H&E stained biopsy cores by using a combination of edge detection, color-based thresholding and texture analysis.

In an aspect, a level set can represent an interface implicitly as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function. For example, a circle of radius 1 centered at (0; 0) can be described explicitly using one independent variable as (cos t, sin t) for 0\u2266t<2\u03c0 or implicitly using two independent variables by setting \u03c6(x1, x2)=1\u2212x12\u2212x22. In an aspect, there can be advantages in moving an interface defined implicitly using a level set function over moving an interface defined by an explicit representation. Moreover, a level set function can provide a natural extension of the local model by replacing the term for change of bone mass in the level set function (2) with the velocity term of the interface by respective scaling constants. For example, the scaling constants can be used to convert the concept of local bone mass to change in the position of the level set function through fits to the bone marrow biopsy data.
