    "title": "Targeting O-Glycosyltransferase (OGT) to Promote Healing of Diabetic Skin Wounds",
    "date": "2014-02-01",
    "abstract": "Non-healing wounds are a significant source of morbidity. This is particularly true for diabetic patients, who tend to develop chronic skin wounds. O-GlcNAc modification of serine and threonine residues is a common regulatory post-translational modification analogous to protein phosphorylation; increased intracellular protein O-GlcNAc modification has been observed in diabetic and hyperglycemic states. Two intracellular enzymes, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-polypeptide \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc-selective N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (OGA), mediate addition and removal, respectively, of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from intracellular protein substrates. Alterations in O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins is linked to diabetes, and the increased levels of protein O-GlcNAc modification observed in diabetic tissues may in part explain some of the observed underlying pathophysiology that contributes to delayed wound healing. We have previously shown that increasing protein O-GlcNAc modification by overexpression of OGT in murine keratinocytes results in elevated protein O-GlcNAc modification and a hyperadhesive phenotype. This study was undertaken to explore the hypothesis that increased O-GlcNAc modification of cellular proteins in diabetic skin could contribute to the delayed wound healing observed in patients with diabetic skin ulcers. In the present study, we show that human keratinocytes cultured under hyperglycemic conditions display increased levels of O-GlcNAc modification as well as a delay in the rate of wound closure in vitro. We further show that specific knockdown of OGT by RNA interference (RNAi) reverses this effect, thereby opening up the opportunity for OGT-targeted therapies to promote wound healing in diabetic patients.",

Scratch wounds were performed by making a linear scratch across monolayers of confluent cells in 24-well culture plates followed by one wash with 1\u03eb PBS and the addition of fresh culture medium. Pictures were taken on a Nikon TE2000-U spinning disk microscope using a 10\u03eb magnification immediately after scratching and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for the amount of time stated in the figure legends before another set of pictures was taken.

Immunoblot of cell lysates shows that increased levels of glucose indeed resulted in more O-GlcNAc modification in keratinocyte lysates, as detected by the O-GlcNAc-specific antibody RL2 (Fig. 1, A andB).

                        "Human Keratinocyte Culture-The apparent link between delayed wound closure and elevated levels of O-GlcNAc modification in HaCaT cells led us to further investigate the role of the enzymes responsible for the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc protein modification (OGT and OGA, respectively) in more detail. To do this, we stably transduced HaCaT cells with shRNAs against either enzyme and analyzed cell lysates by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2, A andB). Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates confirmed the impact of RNAi on O-GlcNAc levels, with shOGT displaying significantly reduced levels of O-GlcNAc modification. The shOGA transduced cells displayed levels of O-GlcNAc modification similar to both the untransduced cells and the shGFP controls (Fig. 2B). Scratchwounding assays of shRNA-transduced cells show that knocking down OGT significantly increases the rate of wound closure (Fig. 2, C andD). shOGA transduced cells were not significantly different from shGFP transduced controls despite evidence that targeting OGA with shRNA reduced total OGA protein levels (data not shown). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that decreasing the amount of O-GlcNAc (via shOGT) accelerates wound healing, providing additional support for the relationship between O-GlcNAc protein modification and wound healing.",

A 19-mer siRNA directed against the OGT mRNA sequence was synthesized, and HaCaT cells were transfected with the OGT-specific silencing RNA as well as a control siRNA with a scrambled sequence. 2 days after transfection, cell lysates were probed for RL2 and OGT immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, A andB). The results show that siRNA against OGT results in a marked knockdown in both OGT levels and RL2 immunoreactivity as quantified from immunoblots.",

These results further support the hypothesis that the level of intracellular O-GlcNAc modification in human keratinocytes is linked to wound closure rate and that this may be manipulated using OGT knockdown."

                "Increasing evidence from the literature suggests that alterations in the hexosamine pathway play a key role in the pathophysiology of diabetes. For example, overexpression of OGT in mice results in a diabetic phenotype (8), and increased levels of O-GlcNAc modification have been observed in cells and tissue from type 2 diabetes patients relative to healthy controls (9,15). Previously, we had reported that overexpression of OGT in keratinocytes (i) increases GlcNAc modification of cellular proteins and (ii) markedly enhances cell-cell adhesion (12). Consistent with these observations, we observed a dose-dependent increase in protein O-GlcNAc modification in human keratinocyte cultures grown in increasing concentrations of glucose. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of glucose and O-GlcNAc protein modification were associated with delayed wound closure in a dose-dependent fashion. Significantly, silencing OGT activity with either OGT-specific shRNA or OGT-specific siRNA decreases GlcNAc modification of keratinocyte proteins and promotes wound healing in a scratch model assay, even in the presence of elevated glucose concen- trations. Collectively, these observations suggest that increased intracellular O-GlcNAc modification, mediated by the enzyme OGT, likely contributes to delayed wound healing in non-healing diabetic skin wounds.",
                "The effects of increased OGT activity on promoting cell adhesion and delaying wound healing may in part be due to regulation of keratinocyte cell adhesion components, including desmosomes, adherens junctions, and cytoskeletal elements as we have previously reported (12). In this context, we previously showed that plakoglobin, a component of both adherens junction and desmosome cell-cell adhesion complexes, is posttranslationally stabilized by increased O-GlcNAc modification in OGT-overexpressing keratinocytes. This increased plakoglobin protein level drove formation of desmosomes and plakoglobin-based adherens junctions and markedly enhanced cell-cell adhesion (12). These observations indicate that in keratinocytes, O-GlcNAc modification functions in part to regulate the post-translational stability of plakoglobin, and significantly, to regulate keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. During wound healing, keratinocytes migrate into the wound to promote re-epithelialization. Keratinocytes at the wound margin must down-regulate adhesion to adjacent cells at the trailing margin to permit movement away from the edge and into the wound. By increasing cell-cell adhesion, we suggest that increased intracellular protein O-GlcNAc modification retards wound healing, whereas down-regulation of intracellular protein O-GlcNAc modification promotes wound healing.",
                "It is worth noting that O-GlcNAc is a ubiquitous intracellular modification. In addition to modifying cell adhesion and structural proteins, transcription factors and regulatory enzymes are also modified by OGT-catalyzed addition of GlcNAc to serine and threonine residues. Thus, the effects of OGT activity are likely to be pleiotropic. In addition to its effects on adhesion, altering levels of intracellular protein O-GlcNAc modification may also impact cell proliferation and chemotaxis, and it may be the combination of these effects that contributes to the observed delayed wound healing.",
                "Diabetic wounds represent a significant health care burden. The incidence and social and financial cost of treating these wounds are likely to increase as the incidence of diabetes rises due to the obesity epidemic and aging populations. We have demonstrated that decreasing the global level of O-GlcNAc modification through knockdown of OGT using RNAi accelerates wound healing in a hyperglycemic keratinocyte culture model. Collectively, these data show that locally targeting OGT may prove an effective approach to promote healing in diabetic ulcers. As it has previously been demonstrated that the impaired barrier function in wounds allows for transfection with oligonucleotides (16), we suggest that topical administration of siRNAs or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against OGT may be an effective treatment to promote healing of diabetic skin wounds.
