                                "Acropora (Scleractinia, Acroporidae) is a common, emblematic genus of reef-building corals. It is also one of the most widespread coral genera, ranging from the Red Sea through the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean, and has the largest number of extant species (113) (Wallace, 1999). The fossil record suggests that the genus probably originated about 50 million years ago (MYR) (Veron, 1995). There are two distinct groups of Acropora corals: mass spawning acroporids and \u201cearly spawners,\u201d that spawn 1.5-3 h earlier than other mass-spawning species (Hatta et al., 1999; Fukami et al., 2000). The two groups are believed to have diverged 6.6 MYA (Fukami et al., 2000). Major diversification within these groups has occurred more recently (2 MYR) (Veron, 1995). In addition, molecular phylogenetic analyses using a single copy gene PaxC intron and mitochondrial markers show that Acropora corals can be divided into four major clades (van Oppen et al., 2001; Marquez et al., 2002) (FIG. 1). Early spawning species, including A. tenuis, belong to the most basal Glade (Clade I) (Fukami et al., 2000; van Oppen et al., 2001), while most of mass-spawning species belong to Clade III. Clade IV has relatively small number of species, including A. digitifera (van Oppen et al., 2001).",
                                "Coral reefs are estimated to harbor around one-third of all described marine species (Knowlton et al., 2010); however, they face a range of anthropogenic challenges, including ocean acidification and increasing seawater temperatures (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Although Acropora species are major components of coral reefs worldwide, they are the most sensitive to increased water temperatures (Loya et al., 2001) and are expected to decline in the near future (Alvarez-Filip et al., 2013). For proper maintenance and conservation of Acropora corals, it is important to understand genetic diversity and connectivity among populations. High-resolution genetic markers, such as microsatellites, are essential for such studies. Previous studies have succeeded in developing microsatellite markers specific to several Acropora species, e.g. A. palmata (Baums et al., 2005), A. millepora (Van Oppen et al., 2007), A. cytherea (Concepcion et al., 2010), and Acropora sp1 and A. digitifera (Nakajima et al., 2009). However, cross-species amplification was confirmed for several markers (Nakajima et al., 2009). Because microsatellite markers are currently available for only about 5 of the 113 Acropora species, an increased number of \u201cuniversal\u201d Acropora microsatellite markers would be extremely useful. In this study we developed cross-species microsatellite markers that can be applied to a variety of Acropora species. To achieve this we used two Acropora species that belong to taxonomically distant clades (I: A. tenuis, IV: A. digitifera) and we took advantage of next-generation sequencing technology to design novel microsatellite primer pairs that can be used for both species."

For each of the particular species of Acropora, a reference pattern of PCR fragment size polymorphism for the one or more of microsatellite loci of the present invention is determined. PCR amplification using, as template, genomic DNA of a coral sample to be identified is carried out for each of the microsatellite loci to obtain a sample pattern of PCR fragment size polymorphism. When the sample pattern matches with one of the reference pattern, then the coral sample is identified to belong to the same species as the species of the referenced pattern.",

                        "The phrase \u201chaving at least 90% sequence identity to a sequence,\u201d as used herein, means that the primer of the present invention has 90% or more, for example, 93, 95, 97, 99% or more, or 100% sequence identity to a particular nucleotide sequence associated with a particular sequence identifier. The sequence identity is determined by aligning the two sequences to be compared as described below, determining the number of identical bases in the aligned portion, dividing that number by the total number of bases in the inventive (queried) sequence, and multiplying the result by 100. Polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences may be aligned, and the percentage of identical residues in a specified region may be determined against another polynucleotide or polypeptide, using a publicly available computer algorithm. Two exemplary algorithms for aligning and identifying the similarity of polynucleotide sequences are the BLASTN and FASTA algorithms. The computer algorithms BLASTN and FASTA are available on the Internet such as The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the U.S. The use of the BLASTN algorithm is described in the publication of Altschul, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402, 1997. The use of the FASTA algorithm is described in Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-2448, 1988; and Pearson, Methods in Enzymol. 183: 63-98, 1990.",

A pair of primers defined with the phrase \u201chaving a nucleotide sequence wherein one or a few nucleotides are deleted, substituted, or added to a particular nucleotide sequence associated with a particular sequence identifier\u201d may also be defined so that the primers amplify DNA of a microsatellite locus disclosed in the present application.",
                        "The phrase \u201cidentifying an allele of a microsatellite locus which exhibits PCR size polymorphism in different genotypes of an Acropora species,\u201d as used herein, means that the size of PCR fragment amplified with genomic DNA of cells derived from a gamete of an Acropora species is distinct from the size of PCR fragment amplified with genomic DNA of cells derived from a different gamete of the Acropora. The particular microsatellite locus which exhibits PCR fragment size polymorphism in a particular combination of coral colonies of interest may be called as an \u201cinformative\u201d locus. Thus, the informative locus may exhibit PCR size polymorphism between one colony of an Acropora species and another colony of the Acropora species may be employed to determine whether the colony is composed of cells derived from a single gamete or the colony is chimeric, that is, composed of cells derived from a plurality of gametes.",
                        "The phrase \u201cdetermining a PCR size polymorphic allele of a microsatellite locus of an Acropora species,\u201d as used herein, means that a coral sample is analysed by PCR amplification to determine whether the coral sample has a particular allele of the microsatellite locus that has a specific PCR fragment size which is distinct from other allele of the same microsatellite locus. A method and kit for determining a PCR size polymorphic allele of a microsatellite locus of an Acropora species comprises a primer pair that is selected by the method of present invention for identifying an allele of a microsatellite locus which exhibits PCR size polymorphism in different genotypes of an Acropora species. The method and kit for determining a PCR size polymorphic allele of a microsatellite locus of an Acropora species is useful in determining whether an entire colony of an Acropora species is composed of cells derived from a single gamete or the colony is chimeric. The method and kit is also useful in quantifying an index of chimeric status of a coral colony. The method and kit is also useful in analyzing genetic composition of coral colony or coral population in a wild or artificial habitat.",
                        "The phrase \u201can index of chimeric level\u201d means for a quantitative parameter of relative contribution of descendent cells of a first coral colony, or a donor colony, in the entire transplanted colony that is comprised of the descendents of the first coral colony and a second coral colony, or a recipient colony, which had been in need of restoration. Alternatively, the index of chimeric level means for relative percentage of cells derived from the first colony in the total cells of the transplanted colony which is comprised of cells derived from the second colony and which may also be comprised of successfully engrafted cells derived from the first colony. The index of chimeric level is determined quantitatively by identifying an informative microsatellite locus for a particular combination of donor and recipient colonies of the same coral species of Acropora genus, determining the molar percentage of the genomic DNA for the alleles representing the first and second coral colonies, and providing the molar percentage of the PCR fragment representing the first coral colony as the index of level of chimerism of the chimeric coral colony restored. The amplification of the genomic DNA for the alleles representing the first and second coral colonies may be carried out with any PCR technique well-known to those skilled in the art, such as Wang L.-J. (2002), with a reaction condition by which the molar percentage of the genomic DNA for the alleles is reproducibly determined with reference to a calibration curve, or a mixing DNA curve. Based on the size of the PCR fragments amplified from the particular alleles of the informative microsatellite locus, the PCR fragments amplified from each allele may be separated with any well-known technique for size separation such as conventional gel electrophoresis, or a capillary electrophoresis with, but not limited to, agarose or polyacrylamide gel as separation media. The amounts of the PCR fragments of each allele may be measured with fluorescence or laser-induced fluorescence based detection system in conjunction with fluor labeling systems. The calibration curve is produced by plotting relative amounts of the PCR fragments amplified with a mixture of genomic DNAs of the first and second colonies at different ratios. Typically, the ratios of the first and second colonies are set as any combination of ratios selected from the group consisting of 0:100, 5:95, 10:90, 15:85, 20:80, . . . , 40:60, 45:55, 50:50, 55:45, . . . , 80:20, 85:15, 90:10, 95:5, and 100:0. The molar percentage of the genomic DNA for the alleles are determined from the relative amounts of the PCR fragments amplified representing the first and second colonies with reference to the calibration curve. The molar percentage of the genomic DNA for the allele representing the first colony is calculated as 100\u00d7 (relative molar content of PCR fragment representing the first colony)/(sum of relative molar contents of PCR fragments representing the first and second colonies). The molar percentages of the genomic DNA for the allele representing the second colony is calculated as 100\u00d7 (relative molar content of PCR fragment representing the second colony)/(sum of relative molar contents of PCR fragments representing the first and second colonies).",

                        "Materials and Methods",
                        "Genomic DNA was isolated from an A. tenuis colony collected at Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan, under Okinawa prefectural permit (Number: 24-48), using the guanidinium reagent, CHAOS (Fukami et al., 2000). We sequenced 250 bp paired end reads using a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) according to manufacturer's instructions. Low quality bases (Phred quality value, QV\u226720) were trimmed from raw data and read pairs of at least 80 bp were retained using SolexaQA (Cox et al., 2010). We used PAL_FINDER (Castoe et al., 2012) for detection of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and PCR primer design from paired end sequencing data. In order to select microsatellite loci that may be highly variable, we selected primer pairs amplifying longer repeat stretches (thresholds: 2 mer; 15 repeats more, 3 mer; 10, 4 mer; 7, 5 mer; 5 and 6 mer; 4, respectively). To remove primers originating from DNA of the symbiotic Symbiodinium, nucleotide sequences of both primers in each pair were mapped to the recently decoded A. digitifera genome (Shinzato et al., 2011), using Symbiodinium-free sperm DNA, and employing BLASTN software (Altschul et al., 1990). In addition, primer pairs from which at least one primer was mapped uniquely to the A. digitifera genome were selected in order to avoid selecting primer pairs that could produce nonspecific PCR amplification.",
                        "For fragment analyses, 30 colonies of A. tenuis were collected at Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan, and 45 colonies of A. digitifera were collected in the Kerama Islands, Okinawa, Japan, respectively (Okinawa prefecture permit number: 24-48). To avoid multiple collections of colonies that could have been produced through asexual fragmentation or propagation, only colonies that were physically distinct and at least 2 m from other colonies were sampled. Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy kit (QIAGEN). The reaction mixture (10 \u03bcL) contained template DNA (<1 ng/L), AmpliTaq Gold 360 Master Mix (Qiagen), and three primers for each locus: a non-tailed reverse primer (0.1 \u03bcM), a forward primer with an M13 Reverse (5\u2032-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3\u2032) sequence tail (0.5 \u03bcM), and an M13 Reverse primer (0.5 \u03bcM) fluorescently labeled with FAM, based on the method of Schuelke (2000). PCR cycling conditions were 15 min at 95\u00b0 C., followed by 32 cycles of 30 s at 94\u00b0 C., 90 s at 58\u00b0 C. (all loci), and 60 s at 72\u00b0 C., with an extension of 30 min at 60\u00b0 C. in the final cycle. In addition to A. tenuis and A. digitifera, we also used A. hyacinthus (Clade III) (FIG. 1) (Marquez et al., 2002) genomic DNA to confirm PCR amplification (data not shown). PCR products from A. tenuis and A. digitifera were identified and analyzed with the ABI 3130 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and GeneMapper v4.1 (Applied Biosystems). The number of alleles and observed and expected heterozygosities were calculated and the probability of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested for each locus and species, using GenAlEx ver. 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse, 2012). Linkage disequilibrium between the loci was tested after Bonferroni correction (P<0.05) using Genepop v4.2 at http://genepop.curtin.edu.au/index.html (Raymond and Rousset, 1995; Rousset, 2008).",
                        "Results and Discussion",
                        "We obtained 6,327,391,737 bp (12,802,836 read pairs) of raw sequence data from A. tenuis genomic DNA. From those we selected high quality 2,534,049,158 bp (6,783,510 read pairs), which were used for microsatellite detection and primer design. Primer pairs (7,200) were produced by PAL_FINDER. In order to eliminate primer pairs that could have produced non-specific PCR amplification and that originated from symbiotic Symbiodinium, we selected pairs from which at least one primer sequence was unique to the A. digitifera genome sequence. Subsequently 141 primer pairs were selected. Among those, we confirmed that 74 pairs could produce PCR amplicons in three Acropora species (A. tenuis, A. digitifera and A. hyacinthus) and performed fragment analyses. We identified fourteen polymorphic nuclear microsatellite DNA makers that did not show significant deviation from HWE after applying Bonferroni correction (P<0.05) in both A. tenuis and A. digitifera. Four markers (9079m3, 11192m4, 8010m6 and 12198m3) showed significant deviation from HWE in A. digitifera, but not in A. tenuis, and one marker (7805m4) showed significant deviation from HWE in A. tenuis, but not in A. digitifera (Table 1). We confirmed that no previously reported Acropora microsatellite primer sequences (Baums et al., 2005; Van Oppen et al., 2007; Nakajima et al., 2009; Concepcion et al., 2010) were detected in the PCR amplicon sequences, indicating that all microsatellite loci identified in this study are novel. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 14 in A. tenuis and 2 to 13 in A. digitifera, respectively (Table 1). Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.192 to 0.933 and 0.341 to 0.892 in A. tenuis and 0.200 to 0.911 and 0.241 to 0.862 in A. digitifera, respectively (Table 1). Although only the linkage disequilibrium between 11401m4 and 11745m3 was significant in A. digitifera, linkage disequilibrium between 11 loci combinations (11401m4-11745m3, 11401m4-11543m5, 11401m4-7203m5, 11401m4-12406m3, 11745m3-12406m3, 12406m3-10366m5, 441m6-12406m3, 530m4-11543m5, 530m4-8346m3, 7203m5-11745m3 and 8346m3-11543m5) was significant in A. tenuis. Alignment of the A. tenuis nucleotide sequences to the A. digitifera genome revealed high nucleotide conservation between A. tenuis and A. digitifera (about 93%, BLASTN, 1e-5, alignment length longer than 100 bp), indicating high genomic similarity between the two species. In addition, all microsatellite loci are located in different scaffold sequences in the A. digitifera genome (Table 1), suggesting that the loci are evenly distributed across these Acropora genomes.",
                        "Table 1 shows characteristics of the 19 developed polymorphic microsatellite loci from A. tenuis and A. digitifera: locus name, repeat motif, primers sequence, number of alleles, size range, observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygotes and GenBank accession number. Numbers of alleles and Ho and He were calculated using GenAlEx (ver. 6.5; Peakall and Smouse, 2012). Asterisks indicate significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after Bonferroni correction (P<0.05) using Genepop v4.2 (Raymond and Rousset, 1995; Rousset, 2008). Accession numbers in A. digitifera are the scaffold nucleotide sequence in which each locus is located.",
                        "Since genome structures of A. digitifera and A. tenuis should be similar, this may reflect the significant A. tenuis population decrease after a massive 1998 bleaching event around Sesoko island (Loya et al., 2001). Thus, the population used in this study was new and recently recruited, possibly resulting in more loci combinations with significant linkage disequilibrium. Although not tested on a large number of Acropora species, fourteen primer pairs were shown to have no significant deviation from HWE in two phylogenetically distant species. These can be used for a variety of Acropora species and may provide powerful tools for Acropora population genetic studies.",
                        "We have recently confirmed that we could detect PCR amplification of the all fourteen markers for, not only A. tenuis and A. digitifera but other 24 Acropora species (Table 2).",
                        "Table 2 shows summary of application of the 14 microsatellite markers for 26 Acropora species. Locus (marker) names, Acropora species that we used are shown. N represents the number of individuals for each species. A circle indicates that we confirmed PCR amplification using the marker. Gray indicate that differences of PCR fragment sizes between individuals were observed in the same species.",
