                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The present disclosure relates generally to training and using a machine learning (ML) model to predict how certain conditions will cause a particular battery pack to discharge, particularly a battery pack found in vehicles such as electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid gas-electric vehicles, and the like. The methods and systems described herein generally include obtaining data pertaining to the cells in battery packs installed in a fleet of currently-operating vehicles, data pertaining to discharge of the cells under real-world conditions, and/or data pertaining to discharge of the cells under simulated conditions. The data is then fed into a ML server, which generates a predictive model that can be used to establish discharge profiles for particular operating conditions.",
                        "Battery packs, particularly those used in vehicles such as EVs and hybrid gas-electric vehicles, consist of an arrangement of cells that contain stored energy. The cells are connected in parallel to form a module, and a plurality of modules are connected in series to form a pack. In some cases, the cells are merely arranged within the modules/the battery pack in a manner to maximize the number of cells. As such, every battery pack that is manufactured may not be exactly the same as others due to varying cell arrangements.",
                        "In addition, certain cells (including relatively low-quality cells and relatively high-quality cells), when placed next to each other or otherwise arranged in a particular manner, may operate sub-optimally under certain conditions. For example, various cells may release various levels of thermal energy (e.g., give off heat) during operation (including charging and discharging) due to the inherent impedance properties of the cells. When two cells that give off a relatively high amount of heat are placed next to each other (relative to two cells that give off a relatively lower amount of heat), the amount of heat that is released may be high enough to damage the cells and/or surrounding components of the battery pack, particularly when the vehicle is driven in hot weather, which can result in, for example, battery pack failure, reduced lifetime of the battery pack, quicker discharge times, slower charge times, and/or the like. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to space cells exhibiting high resistance apart from one another to maintain an overall temperature of the modules and the pack in general to avoid heat related issues, particularly when the vehicle is driven in hot weather. In another example, it may be preferable to avoid placing a cells having a relative higher capacity adjacent one another in a module or in a pack so as to avoid stressing the relative lower capacity cells also present in the module or in the pack, particularly when the rate of discharge is higher than a typical rate of discharge (e.g., when the vehicle is driven at a higher speed, up a slope, and/or the like). Accordingly, it becomes necessary to space the relative higher capacity cells apart from one another to avoid stress on the relative lower capacity cells under certain operating conditions.",
                        "Some systems and methods merely monitor battery pack operation at a pack level (e.g., the battery pack as a whole). Monitoring in this manner is not sufficiently granular to obtain the data that is necessary for machine learning and generation of a model that can be used for configuring cells and modules within a pack.",
                        "Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative network, generally designated 100, of devices and systems for predicting a discharge profile of a battery pack under particular operating conditions according to embodiments shown and described herein. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the network 100 may include a wide area network, such as the internet, a local area network (LAN), a mobile communications network, a public service telephone network (PSTN) and/or other network and may be configured to electronically connect a battery configuration system 110, one or more vehicles 122 in a fleet of vehicles 120, one or more user computing devices 130, one or more mobile devices 140, one or more machine learning servers 150, and/or one or more battery testing devices 160.",
                        "The battery configuration system 110 is generally a computing device that carries out various processes for determining an arrangement of cells in a battery pack (including a module thereof) and directs placement of the cells accordingly, as described in greater detail herein. The battery configuration system 110 contains one or more hardware components, as will be discussed herein with respect to FIGS. 3A and 3B.",

For example, each vehicle 122 in the fleet of vehicles 120 may be an electric vehicle, a gas-electric hybrid vehicle, or the like. Each vehicle 122 in the fleet of vehicles 120 can be communicatively coupled to any of the components within the network 100 to transmit data corresponding to the battery pack, and can further receive instructions for utilizing the battery pack therein, as described in greater detail herein. Accordingly, each vehicle 122 in the fleet of vehicles 120 includes one or more hardware components that are used for generating data, communicating data, receiving commands, and executing commands, as described herein with respect to FIG. 4.",
                        "Still referring to FIG. 1, the one or more user computing devices 130 and the one or more mobile devices 140 may generally be devices that are used by a user to transmit information from at least one vehicle 122 in the fleet of vehicles 120 (if the vehicle within the fleet of vehicle is not directly coupled to the network 100) and/or receive information from the battery configuration system 110 (e.g., directions) that is used to arrange the cells within a battery pack (or a module thereof) during manufacture of the battery pack. For example, the one or more user computing devices 130 and/or the one or more mobile devices 140 may be communicatively coupled to a vehicle 122 from the fleet of vehicles 120 to receive data from the vehicle (e.g., via the vehicle's on-board diagnostics (OBD) port) and transmit the data via the network 100 to another device (e.g., the battery configuration system 110). In another example, the one or more user computing devices 130 and/or the one or more mobile devices 140 may be integrated with an electric vehicle charging station such that, when the vehicle 122 is connected to the charging station for a charge, a data connection is created between the vehicle 122 and the charging station (e.g., at least one of the user computing device 130 and the mobile device 140) such that data can be transmitted to one or more other components connected to the network 100 via the charging station. In yet another example, the one or more user computing devices 130 and/or the one or more mobile devices 140 may be located in a vehicle repair facility, vehicle dealership, and/or the like. In yet another example, the one or more user computing devices 130 and/or the one or more mobile devices 140 may be located in a battery manufacturing facility, and may receive instructions that are either displayed to a person assembling a battery pack or provided to a robot assembling a battery pack. The instructions may direct the user or the robot to pick certain cells exhibiting characteristics, place the cells in a particular location or in a particular relation to other cells or other battery components (e.g., sensors, cooling devices, or the like), bend the cells in a particular manner, and/or the like when a particular battery pack is intended to be used for a particular purpose. Each of the one or more user computing devices 130 may generally be any computing device that includes components that allow the device to perform any user-facing functions (e.g., a display, a user input device, memory, processing device, communications ports, and/or the like), and is otherwise not limited by the present disclosure. Similarly, each of the one or more mobile devices 140 may generally be any computing device that includes components that allow the device to perform any user-facing functions (e.g., a display, a user input device, memory, processing device, communications ports, and/or the like), and is otherwise not limited by the present disclosure.",

That is, data from full diagnostic cycles may be obtained during vehicle services (e.g., when the vehicle is at the dealership, a repair shop, or the like). In such embodiments, additional external hardware associated with the one or more user computing devices 130 and/or the one or more mobile devices 140 may be used to obtain the data, such as, for example, a connection between the vehicle and a computer that is configured to cause a controlled charge or discharge of the battery while at the same time receiving data from one or more sensors.",
                        "The one or more machine learning servers 150 are generally computing devices that store one or more machine learning algorithms thereon and are particularly configured to receive data pertaining to the cells in batteries and generate a model therefrom, the model being useable by the battery configuration system 110 to predict one or more discharge profiles for any battery pack (including battery packs having different arrangements of cells therein) for a one or more operating conditions, as described in greater detail herein. The machine learning algorithms utilized by the one or more machine learning servers 150 are not limited by the present disclosure, and may generally be any algorithm now known or later developed, particularly those that are specifically adapted for generating a predictive model that can be used for estimating electrical characteristics of cells. That is, the machine learning algorithms may be supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, semi-supervised learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Specific examples of machine learning algorithms may include, but are not limited to, nearest neighbor algorithms, na\u00efve Bayes algorithms, decision tree algorithms, linear regression algorithms, supervised vector machines, neural networks, clustering algorithms, association rule learning algorithms, Q-learning algorithms, temporal difference algorithms, and deep adversarial networks. One particular algorithm may utilize dynamic time warping (DTW). Another particular algorithm may utilize reinforcement, such as a QV-learning algorithm.

The battery testing devices 160 may generally test batteries or components thereof (e.g., modules, cells, or the like) that are not installed in vehicles (i.e., not contained within one of the vehicles 122). The battery testing devices 160 may test a battery or component thereof for charge, voltage, discharge rate, charging time, life span, physical characteristics, chemical composition, cranking amps, internal battery management systems functionality, and/or the like. The battery testing devices 160 may also simulate various discharge conditions. For example, the battery testing devices 160 may complete an EV Drive Cycle Simulation (e.g., Federal Urban Drive Schedule\u2014FUDS), a Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) test, and/or the like. In embodiments with respect to testing of individual cells, the battery testing devices 160 may be used for electrochemistry, battery, and supercapacitor testing, HPCE measurements, electrochemical research and development, half-cell testing, life cycle testing, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and/or the like.

Examples of data that may be obtained and/or generated by the one or more battery testing devices 160 based on a testing of particular battery packs include, but is not limited to, relaxation after high rate pulse discharge data, diagnostic cycle data, and charge cycle data. As described herein, each of the aforementioned data can be linked to higher quality features determined from the one or more battery testing devices 160 (e.g., EIS spectra, C-V curves, and/or the like). Relaxation data may be obtained by the one or more battery testing devices 160 either with a deliberate high current discharge pulse controlled by a motor controller or from a high current discharge (i.e., during acceleration). Charging cycles may yield data that is closest to galvanostatic cycling since the charging typically occurs at constant current or constant power.",

For example, the operational data may include voltage information for each of the modules 210 and/or cells 220 within the battery pack 200, impedance information for each of the modules 210 and/or cells 220 within the battery pack 200, operating temperatures within the battery pack 200, including operating temperatures of various modules 210 and/or cells 220, an amount of time necessary to discharge each module 210 and/or cell 220 in particular operating conditions, an amount of time necessary to charge each module 210 and/or cell 220 in particular operating conditions, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the operational data may be obtained from various ones of the vehicle sensor hardware 430 such that operating conditions of the vehicle 122 can be determined. For example, the data received from the vehicle sensor hardware 430 may be indicative of an environmental temperature outside the vehicle 122, the type of terrain the vehicle 122 is traversing, whether the vehicle 122 is in stop-and-go traffic, the gradation of the road the vehicle 122 is traversing, how fast the vehicle 122 drives, how quickly the vehicle 122 accelerates and/or decelerates, and/or the like.",
                        "The operational data may generally be received directly from the vehicle 122 containing the battery pack 200 (e.g., via a data connection between the vehicle 122 and the battery configuration system 110), from at least one of the one or more user computing devices 130, and/or from at least one of the one or more mobile devices 140 (e.g., when the vehicle 122 is connected to a user computing device 130 or a mobile computing device by the OBD port in the vehicle 122). For example, if the vehicle 122 has a constant data connection (or is connected to a mobile device 140 that provides a constant data connection), data from the battery pack 200 installed therein may be continuously transmitted according to block 502, or may be transmitted at particular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or the like). In another example, data from the vehicle 122 may be transmitted when the vehicle is in a technician's shop or other location containing a user computing device 130 or a mobile device 140 that obtains the data from the vehicle and relays the data to the battery configuration system 110. In yet another example, in embodiments where the user computing device 130 or the mobile computing device is a charging station, the data may be offloaded from the vehicle 122 to the battery configuration system 110 when the vehicle is connected to the charging station for charging.",
                        "It should be understood that in some embodiments, the cell configuration data received according to block 502 and the operational data received according to block 504 may occur substantially simultaneously. That is, the data stream received by the battery configuration system 110 may include both cell configuration data and operational data in some embodiments.",
                        "At block 506, the operating conditions in which the vehicle 122 is operating may be determined from the operational data. For example, data from one or more sensors may be used to determine one or more operating condition segments, a terrain for each segment, an amount of traffic in each segment, an ambient temperature outside the vehicle for each segment, length of time the vehicle 122 is driven, the speed (or average speed) the vehicle 122 is driven, the temperature of the battery pack 200, components thereof, the operating temperature of various vehicle components, and/or the like.",
                        "At block 508, diagnostic cycling data and/or other data is obtained from the one or more battery testing devices 160. That is, the one or more battery testing devices 160 mimic one or more driving patterns when applying a load to a battery pack 200 being tested, collect data regarding the discharge of the battery pack 200 in response to the one or more mimicked driving patterns, and transmit the data to the battery configuration system 110. In some embodiments, the one or more battery testing devices 160 transforms an amount of time that would normally occur to fully cycle a cell into a plurality of cells being cycled such that the total amount of time necessary to do a cycle of learning is shortened, relative to a vehicle 122 cycling cells in a battery pack 200. As such, the one or more battery testing devices 160 are able to generate significantly more data regarding battery pack discharge for a plurality of operating conditions relative to the amount of data that is generated from each vehicle 122 in the fleet of vehicles 120. For example, the one or more battery testing devices 160, instead of taking the full amount of time to cycle cells, explores all of the possible cycling conditions that may be encountered in a vehicle and test a plurality of cells substantially simultaneously instead of a single cycle or a plurality of cycles on a particular cell. In some embodiments, the one or more battery testing devices 160 may mimic the one or more driving patterns based on the cell configuration data received at block 502 and the operational data received at block 504.",
                        "It should be understood that the term \u201cdiagnostic cycling\u201d generally refers to an intentional cycling of a particular battery pack 200 in a particular standardized way, rather than a dynamic cycling that the same battery pack 200 would experience if used in a driven vehicle 122. That is, under real-world conditions, such as the conditions that result in the operational data received in block 504, the current or power being drawn from the battery pack 200 or placed into the battery pack 200 varies with time. As a result, the battery pack 200 may not be fully charged and/or fully discharged every time it is cycled. In contrast, with diagnostic cycling, the battery pack 200 may be fully charged and fully discharged in every cycle.",
                        "At block 510, all of the data obtained may be provided to the one or more machine learning servers 150. That is, the cell configuration data received at block 502, the operational data received at block 506, data pertaining to determined operating conditions pursuant to block 506, and diagnostic cycling data from the one or more battery testing devices 160 received at block 508 may be provided to the one or more machine learning servers 150. In some embodiments, the data may be transmitted from the various devices (e.g., the vehicles 122, the one or more user computing devices 130, the one or more mobile devices 140, the one or more battery testing devices 160, and/or the like) directly to the one or more machine learning servers 150 via the network 100. In other embodiments, the data may be collected by the battery configuration system 110 and then transmitted to the one or more machine learning servers 150 via the network 100.",
                        "Once the one or more machine learning servers 150 receive the data, the one or more machine learning servers 150 may be directed by the battery configuration system 110 to generate a predictive model at block 512. That is, a signal may be transmitted from the battery configuration system 110 to the one or more machine learning servers 150 (e.g., via the network 100) that causes the machine learning servers 150 to feed the received data (e.g., the cell configuration data, the operational data, data pertaining to operating conditions, and/or data from the one or more battery testing devices 160 (e.g., cell configuration data and/or other data)) into a predictive model and/or generate a predictive model from the data. The predictive model may generally be any machine learning model now known or later developed, particularly one that provides resulting information that can be used to determine optimum battery pack configuration for a particular use. Illustrative general examples of machine learning models include, but are not limited to, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a neural network (NN) model, a dynamic time warping (DTW) model, or the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, descriptor-based models and LFTM models, as described herein.",
                        "Various machine learning implementations of Q-V based early prediction strategies may be used. For example, the one or more battery testing devices 160 may follow a dynamic/stochastic (driving inspired) discharge profile and features in that data that represent early failure may be discovered. In another example, a diagnostic discharge cycle for a module 210 approximately every nth cycle (e.g., 100, 500, 1000, or the like) and fill-in between may be completed, with driving-inspired discharge/charge profiles in between, which allows use of an early-prediction method (or any future Q-V based feature-engineered ML method). In yet another example, completing the diagnostics during a charge step for every nth cycle (e.g., every 100th cycle for a module), which is already controlled, and complete the driving-inspired charge/discharge in between.",
                        "From the data, it may be possible to determine how a particular battery pack discharges over a known terrain with traffic (e.g., rush hour traffic) versus the same terrain without traffic. The data may also indicate how the battery pack 200 discharges when fully charged (e.g., having 100% charge) versus when it is less than fully charged (e.g., about 30% charged, about 50% charged, or the like). In each of these situations, different loads may be sensed for the battery, different requirements in terms of current, different operating conditions, different temperature, and/or the like are imposed on the battery pack 200.",
                        "Since the data is collected for a large number of vehicles 122/battery packs 200, each with their own particular driving characteristics (e.g., due to different drivers in each vehicle 122, locations where the vehicle 122 is driven, different driving conditions, different simulated conditions, and/or the like), the ML algorithms can be utilized to determine a predicted discharge based on a given set of driving/vehicle characteristics.",
                        "The predictive model may be transmitted to the battery configuration system 110 for further use as described hereinbelow. In some embodiments, the predictive model may be stored in a battery database or the like such that it can be subsequently retrieved for updating, subsequent use by the battery configuration system 110, accessed by a vehicle 122 from the fleet of vehicles 120, and/or the like. For example, the predictive model may be stored as part of the machine learning model data 352 within the data storage component 350 of the battery configuration system 110.",
                        "At block 514, the battery configuration system 110 may receive the predictive model from the one or more machine learning servers 150 (or retrieve the predictive model from data storage). The battery configuration system 110 may generate one or more predicted discharge profiles based on the predictive model for each of one or more operating conditions at block 516. For example, a representative profile may be established for a drive whereby the vehicle 122 is driven on surface streets for 10 minutes, another representative profile may be established for another driver whereby the vehicle 122 is driven on a freeway for 20 minutes, or the like. Data relating to the discharge of the battery pack 200 for each of these profiles is also obtained and can be fed back to the one or more machine learning servers 150 to update the predictive model and predict how the battery pack 200 will discharge under certain other arbitrary conditions.",
                        "At block 518, one or more subspaces in each discharge profile may be generated. Each subspace is created out of principal components using dynamic time warping (DTW), ECW, distance, and/or the like to compare or extract relevant information from different battery packs 200 or different cycles to forecast (e.g., cycles to failure, capacity, fade, and/or the like). As such, a particular driving profile can be categorized into different bins.",
                        "At block 520, each discharge profile (and any subspaces thereof) are provided to one or more external devices. For example, one or more discharge profiles may be provided to the battery configuration system 110 for further use, the one or more machine learning servers 150 for further use, the one or more battery testing devices 160 for further use, and/or the like. In another example, one or more discharge profiles may be stored in a storage device, such as, for example, the data storage component 350. In yet another example, one or more discharge profiles may be transmitted to an external computing device, such as a manufacturing computing device or the like that uses the one or more discharge profiles to construct a battery pack in a particular manner such that the battery pack is suited for a particular intended use. In embodiments where one or more discharge profiles (and any subspaces thereof) are transmitted to the one or more battery testing devices 160, additional controlled testing may be completed on battery packs 200 to ascertain how a particular battery pack will respond, given a set of particular driving profile or subspace thereof.",

The methods and systems generally include obtaining data pertaining to the cells in battery packs installed in a fleet of currently-operating vehicles, data pertaining to discharge of the cells under real-world conditions, and/or data pertaining to discharge of the cells under simulated conditions. The data is then fed into a ML server, which generates a predictive model that can be used to establish discharge profiles for particular operating conditions.",
