    "title": "Western Blotting via Proximity Ligation for High Performance Protein Analysis",
    "date": "2011-11-01",
    "abstract": "Western blotting is a powerful and widely used method, but limitations in detection sensitivity and specificity, and dependence upon high quality antibodies to detect targeted proteins, are hurdles to overcome. The in situ proximity ligation assay, based on dual antibody recognition and powerful localized signal amplification, offers increased detection sensitivity and specificity, along with an ability to identify complex targets such as phosphorylated or interacting proteins. Here we have applied the in situ proximity ligation assay mechanism in Western blotting. This combination allowed the use of isothermal rolling circle amplification of DNA molecules formed in target-specific ligation reaction, for 16-fold or greater increase in detection sensitivity. The increased specificity because of dual antibody recognition ensured highly selective assays, detecting the specific band when combinations of two cross-reactive antitubulin antibodies were used (i.e. both producing distinct nonspecific bands in traditional Western blotting). We also demonstrated detection of phosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 by proximity ligation with one antibody directed against the receptor and another directed against the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. This avoided the need for stripping and re-probing the membrane or aligning two separate traditional blots. We demonstrate that the high-performance in situ proximity ligation-based Western blotting described herein is compatible with detection via enhanced chemiluminescence and fluorescence detection systems, and can thus be readily employed in any laboratory.",

                "Antibodies and Their Specificities-The following antibodies were used for both traditional WB and PLA WB: Polyclonal rabbit antihuman transferrin antibody (Dako) specific for human transferrin, mouse FIG. 1. The probing steps of single-and dual-recognition PLA WB. Protein samples are first separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking, the blotted membrane is incubated with primary antibodies to probe target proteins, as in a standard two-step WB protocol. Instead of adding a secondary antibody with a detectable function, a pair of PLA probes are then added. These two reagents are composed of species-specific anti-Ig secondary antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides of two different sequences. Both PLA probes can recognize one protein in reactions depending on target recognition by single primary antibodies (A) or the secondary reagents can be used to bind two primary antibodies directed against different epitopes (B) and against post-translational modifications (C) in reactions dependent on dual recognition of target molecules. Only when both PLA probes bind in close proximity to each other can a circular DNA strand be formed by ligation of the two added oligonucleotides (yellow and black) using a DNA ligase (step 2). The circularized oligonucleotide template formed by ligation triggers isothermal RCA from the 3\u0408 end of an oligonucleotide on one of the PLA probes, giving rise to a long single stranded DNA concatemer containing around 1000 complements of the DNA circle (step 3). Hybridization of HRP-or fluorophore-labeled detection probes to the concatemers results in dramatically amplified ECL or fluorescence signals specific for the target protein (step 4).",

A 2-fold dilution series of transferrin from 2.5 ng to 0.08 pg was analyzed using the CCD camera and the integrated signal intensities were quantified using the ImageQuant TL image analysis software (Fig. 2). After the sequential exposures from 10 s to 2 min, detection limits of 10 pg and 5 pg transferrin, respectively, were reached for traditional WB (Fig. 2A). To avoid signal saturation, only a 10 s exposure was used for PLA WB to detect the full dilution series. With this shorter exposure time, a detection limit of as little as 0.08 pg transferrin was reached, corresponding to around 60-fold increase in sensitivity over traditional WB (Fig. 2B). The dynamic range was similar for both PLA WB and traditional WB and was close to 2.4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 2C).",

Compared with traditional WB detection an \u03f38 -21-fold increase in signal intensity was achieved that enabled PLA WB to detect two further serially diluted target bands, corresponding to a 16fold increase in sensitivity (Fig. 3A). The signal intensity for PLA WB resulted in saturation for the highest protein concentration with 1 min film exposure. This suggested that the true signal amplification can be much larger. Similar results were obtained for PDGFR\u2424 (Fig. 3B). The PLA WB signal was 25-fold stronger when an amount of lysate corresponding to 10 5 cells was applied and three further serial dilutions were detectable, representing a 64-fold increase in sensitivity compared with traditional WB. For detection of PDGFR\u2424 phosphorylated on tyrosine751, the PLA WB provided an \u03f370-fold signal increase (Fig. 3C). Only a weak signal was visible for samples containing 10 5 cells by traditional WB, PLA WB enabled detection of the phosphorylated receptor from as little as 6000 cells using PLA WB with a pair of primary antibodies.",

Fig. 4 shows the dramatic increases of signals using PLA WB, ranging from 25-to 50-fold, for all sample concentrations compared with stan-dard WB detection. The relative sensitivity was greater for the lower sample concentrations.",
                        "Detection Specificity-In order to determine if also the specificity of detection can be improved by using PLA WB assays where two primary antibodies rather than one must bind the target molecules, human fibroblast BJ hTert cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and WB. \u2424-tubulin was targeted using three different probing approaches, all visualized via ECL detection (Fig. 5). Traditional WB using rabbit antitubulin primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies resulted in detection of several unspecific protein bands, in addition to the expected band at a molecular weight close to 55 kDa (Fig. 5A, top). Another, less unspecific mouse anti-\u2424-tubulin primary antibody resulted in a single weak unspecific extra band corresponding to a molecular weight lower than 55 kDa, in addition to the specific \u2424-tubulin band (Fig. 5A,middle). In this approach two secondary antimouse IgG PLA probes were used to reveal the binding by mouse anti-\u2424-tubulin antibodies via PLA WB for single primary antibodies. By contrast, in a dual recognition PLA WB experiment, simultaneous binding by both primary antibodies was required for detection via secondary antirabbit IgG and antimouse IgG antibodies with attached DNA strands as PLA probes. Under these conditions only the specific \u2424-tubulin band was detected and no non-overlapping cross reactive bands appeared (Fig. 5A,bottom). The experiment in Fig. 5B produced similar results using unspecific chicken and rabbit antitubulin in traditional WB (Fig. 5B, top and middle), compared with the dual recognition PLA WB where both primary antibodies must recognize the target (Fig. 5B, bottom). The dual recognition PLA WB produced one specific \u2424-tubulin signal, and thus avoided detection of the unspecific bands that appeared when each of the primary antibodies was used individually. These results illustrate the improved detection specificity resulting from dual recognition PLA using two relatively unspecific primary antibodies, as the PLA WB requires that both primary antibodies bind to the same or closely proximal target molecules in order to produce a signal.",
                        "Detection of Post-translational Modifications-The requirement for dual recognition by PLA can also be of value to investigate more complex targets, e.g. interacting proteins or post-translational modifications. In order to investigate this point, lysates from human fibroblast control cells or cells stimulated with PDGF-BB were subjected to WB. A pair of antibodies directed against PDGFR\u2424 and against the specific phosphorylation of tyrosine751 of the receptor were applied separately in traditional WB (Fig. 6A, top). In order to determine if the two antibodies bind to targets of the same approximate molecular weight, two parallel blots of the same sample need to be probed for ECL readout. Alternatively, the same blot can be investigated sequentially. Phosphorylation on ty-rosine751 of PDGFR\u2424 in the lysate from stimulated cells was detected as a weak signal by traditional WB after 1 min film exposure. Using dual recognition PLA WB, simultaneous probing with both primary antibodies from different species produced one single band, indicating the presence of the tyrosine751-phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 6A,bottom). With only 10 s film exposure, the resulting PLA signals were already considerably stronger than the corresponding signals produced by traditional WB. In the absence of stimulation no PDGFR\u2424 phosphorylation was observed and accordingly no clear signal was detected for control cells (Fig. 6A, bottom). PLA WB thus allows confident detection of a post-translationally modified protein in a single assay, whereas two separate or sequential probings are commonly undertaken in traditional WB. Also, PLA WB reveals molecular proximity between the binding sites for the two primary antibodies, rather than the more poorly resolved comigration of proteins on gels. Another example of detection of PDGF receptor modification is shown in Fig. 6B using lysates from PDGF-induced CCD-1064sk cells. This time another pair of primary antibodies was used for dual recognition PLA WB to specifically detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR\u2424. A mouse anti-PDGFR\u2424 (2B3) targeted PDGFR\u2424 and a rabbit antiphospho-PDGFR \u2423/\u2424 (C43E9) was specific for Tyr849 phosphorylation on PDGFR\u2423 and for Tyr857 phosphorylation on PDGFR\u2424. Using traditional WB with 10 min exposure to film, separate probings with these antibodies gave rise to several unspecific bands in addition to the expected bands (Fig. 6B, top and middle). In dual recognition PLA WB assay, only a specific band with the approximate molecular weight of 190 kDa was detected after 1 min film exposure indicating the phosphorylation on PDGFR\u2424 (Fig. 6B, bottom)."

The ECL signals were captured by film with 1 min exposure for traditional WB and 10 s for PLA WB. pared with reaction conditions for in situ PLA detection for microscopy, reagent concentrations in general must be lowered, and robust reaction mixing must be applied for detection of proteins on the highly adsorptive membranes in order to achieve optimal signal-to-noise ratios.",
                "We show herein that PLA WB provides improved detection sensitivity compared with traditional WB, because of the specific recognition and the potent signal amplification via RCA. This offers a valuable opportunity to investigate molecules present in very few copies per cell, or in only a minority of cells within a heterogeneous population, and the improved sensitivity can also permit analysis of small amounts of sample, reducing consumption of precious samples.",
                "It is well known that so-called sandwich immunoreactions, where antigens are detected via binding by two antibodies, generally provide greater specificity of detection compared with single binder assays. This dependence on dual binding serves to discriminate against cross reactive recognition that is not shared between two antibodies. In traditional WB, detection depends on recognition by single antibodies, whereas the molecular weight of the targeted protein provides an additional criterion for identification. Frequently, nonspecific bands are observed in WB. In such cases PLA WB can facilitate identification of the correct protein. For the pairs of antibodies tested herein PLA WB eliminated the nonspecific bands and the assay may thus also enable the use of antibodies that would give rise to cross reactivity in traditional WB. This feature of PLA WB can help reduce dependence on high-quality antibodies and molecular weight confirmation in WB analysis. However, any irrelevant protein detected by both antibodies will still appear in PLA WB. FIG. 6. Detection of phosphorylated PDGFR\u2424 using traditional WB and PLA WB. Phosphorylated PDGFR\u2424 in the control and PDGF-BBstimulated lysates from 5 \u03eb 10 5 human fibroblast BJ hTert cells was targeted by traditional WB or dual recognition PLA WB with ECL readout. A, For traditional WB detection the receptor and the phosphorylated tyrosine751 were separately targeted using primary rabbit anti-PDGFR\u2424 or mouse antiphospho-PDGFR\u2424 (Tyr751) antibodies, respectively, and the corresponding antispecies IgG secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (top image). PLA WB was performed using a combination of the same two primary antibodies, followed by secondary antirabbit and antimouse PLA probes to detect the phosphorylated receptor (bottom image). The traditional and PLA WB signals were captured by film exposure of 1 min and 10 s, respectively. B, PDGFR\u2424 phosphorylation was also investigated using another pair of primary antibodies in lysate (1.9 g) from PDGF-BB stimulated CCD 1064sk cells using traditional WB, probing with two antibodies in separate reactions (top and middle image) and by dual recognition PLA WB using the two antibodies in a single reaction (bottom image). Readout was via ECL. Rabbit antiphosphor-PDGFR\u2423 (Tyr849)/PDGFR\u2424 (Tyr857) primary antibody was followed by a secondary antirabbit HRP (top image). Mouse anti-PDGFR\u2424 primary antibody was revealed by a secondary antimouse HRP (middle image). A combination of these two primary antibodies were applied with secondary antirabbit and antimouse PLA probes (bottom image). The traditional and PLA WB signals were captured by the film exposure for 10 and 1 min, respectively. So far, in situ PLA has mainly been used to interrogate more complex targets such as protein interactions and post-translational modification of proteins, but we illustrate here that the technique brings a valuable increase of detection specificity to localized protein detection via the requirement for dual recognition. The assay could also be used to distinguish closely similar proteins, such as splice variants that share some but not all epitopes. We demonstrate herein that PLA WB facilitates detection of post-translationally modified proteins, exemplified by the detection of phosphorylated PDGFR\u2424. The assay could also be used to demonstrate protein interactions such as receptor dimerization and aggregation products using native gel electrophoresis.",
                "Compared with traditional WB, PLA WB requires more reaction steps and about 2 more hours. Work is in progress to simplify the process.",
                "In conclusion, the PLA WB method presented herein provides several distinct advantages compared with traditional WB in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and the ability to distinguish closely similar protein variants. By visualizing detected proteins in blots as locally amplified DNA sequences it will also be possible to use the coding potential of DNA to detect multiple different targets on the same blot in one assay by simultaneous or sequential hybridization with detection probes specific for distinct RCA products."
