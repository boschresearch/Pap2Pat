    "title": "Regeneration of severely damaged lungs using an interventional cross-circulation platform",
    "date": "2019-05-07",
    "abstract": "The number of available donor organs limits lung transplantation, the only lifesaving therapy for the increasing population of patients with end-stage lung disease. A prevalent etiology of injury that renders lungs unacceptable for transplantation is gastric aspiration, a deleterious insult to the pulmonary epithelium. Currently, severely damaged donor lungs cannot be salvaged with existing devices or methods. Here we report the regeneration of severely damaged lungs repaired to meet transplantation criteria by utilizing an interventional cross-circulation platform in a clinically relevant swine model of gastric aspiration injury. Enabled by cross-circulation with a living swine, prolonged extracorporeal support of damaged lungs results in significant improvements in lung function, cellular regeneration, and the development of diagnostic tools for non-invasive organ evaluation and repair. We therefore propose that the use of an interventional cross-circulation platform could enable recovery of otherwise unsalvageable lungs and thus expand the donor organ pool.",

                "Organ transplantation has overcome significant technical, immunological, and ethical hurdles to become a lifesaving treatment1. The full potential of organ transplantation remains constrained by the global shortage of organs\u2014a problem that has been described as \u201cthe greatest crisis facing biomedicine today\u201d2. Notably, up to 80% of donated lungs are not utilized3, often as a result of injury at the time of death (e.g., trauma, pulmonary contusion, aspiration, ventilator-associated lung injury). Major efforts to expand the donor pool are underway4\u20136, including ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), which is under clinical investigation as a means to evaluate and improve marginal quality donor lungs7. With the use of hyperosmotic and blood-based perfusates, EVLP has been shown to decrease pulmonary edema and enable ~6\u2009h of normothermic perfusion prior to transplantation8,9. EVLP is also used as an investigational platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents including antibiotics10, pulmonary surfactant11,12, immunomodulatory viral vectors13,14, and mesenchymal stem cells15,16.",
                "Despite the clinical use of EVLP since its introduction in 2012 and expansion of criteria for donor lungs, the annual number of lung transplants in the United States has not dramatically increased17. Consequently, there is a compelling need to extend organ recovery capabilities beyond the limited category of marginal lungs to severely damaged lungs, such as those injured by aspiration of gastric contents (hydrochloric acid, bile acids, gastric enzymes, and food particulates18,19). Gastric aspiration results in damage to the pulmonary epithelium, leading to pneumonitis and respiratory insufficiency18. Previous attempts to recover lungs injured by gastric aspiration using EVLP have been unsuccessful20, having resulted in increased edema21 and failure to reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines22 or improve tissue morphology23 (Supplementary Table\u00a01\u20133).",
                "We previously reported the development of an extracorporeal organ support platform that utilized cross-circulation to radically extend the duration of time that lungs can be maintained outside the body (normothermic perfusion time 37.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009h; total extracorporeal preservation time 56.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009h)24. Following these prolonged extracorporeal preservation times, lungs met all transplantation criteria and showed maintenance of pulmonary vasoregulation, microvascular and bronchial epithelial tight junctions, alveolar type II pneumocyte surfactant recycling, airway submucosal gland secretory activity, and a coordinated mucociliary escalator. Based on these results, we hypothesized that normothermic perfusion via cross-circulation could enable therapeutic interventions leading to functional recovery and regeneration of severely damaged lungs.",
                "In this study, we use an established clinically relevant large animal model of gastric aspiration to recapitulate severe injury that currently renders a large number of donated lungs unsalvageable for clinical transplantation. We investigate the ability of the cross-circulation platform to: (i) provide prolonged normothermic extracorporeal support of severely damaged lungs outside the body, and (ii) enable continuous assessment of lung regeneration at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Severely damaged lungs are subjected to multiple therapeutic interventions\u2014bronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar recruitment\u2014on an interventional cross-circulation platform that provided physiologic systemic regulation. We also apply non-invasive diagnostics (exosomes, surface thermography) in extracorporeal lungs on cross-circulation support, and establish benchmarks of lung repair and regeneration and corresponding scope of analyses (Supplementary Table\u00a04)."

                        "To induce lung injury, gastric contents (2\u2009mL\u2009kg\u22121; pH 2) were delivered into a single lung of an anesthetized swine via flexible video bronchoscopy, and an acute injury was allowed to develop for 6\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01a; Supplementary Movie\u00a02). Progression of lung injury was assessed every 2\u2009h by radiography, bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis, and serologic and hemogas analyses (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Table\u00a05). Upon explant, extensive lung consolidation, cellular derangement, peribronchial edema, and regions of alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and pervasive infiltration of leukocytes were observed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Lungs were cannulated, and pulmonary venous drainage was managed with cannulas placed through a vascular bio-bridge to enable single lung functional assessment (i.e., gas exchange in injured and control lungs; Fig.\u00a01c\u2013g; Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a\u2013h). An endotracheal tube was inserted and secured in the extracorporeal lungs to enable continuous ventilation throughout the duration of the study. Periodic use of bronchial blockers enabled single lung assessment of compliance of injured and control lungs (Fig.\u00a01h\u2013j; Supplementary Fig.\u00a02i\u2013m). Following cannulation of the internal jugular veins of the recipient, lungs were connected to the extracorporeal circuit and cross-circulation was established. All cross-circulation procedures were conducted in an operating room and utilized clinical equipment and supporting devices (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 1Experimental overview and technique for single lung functional assessment. a Setup of interventional cross-circulation procedures.

Six hours after in vivo delivery of gastric contents, chest X-rays showed marked unilateral lung injury characterized by increased radiopacity, basilar atelectasis, and areas of consolidation with air bronchograms (Fig.\u00a02a). Bronchoscopy revealed severe unilateral airway inflammation, edema, and mucus secretions (Fig.\u00a02b) resulting from the insult of gastric contents. Lung donors experienced hemodynamic instability (increased heart rate, decreased MAP; Fig.\u00a02c, d), significantly decreased gas exchange capacity (Fig.\u00a02f\u2013h), and developed a severe inflammatory response (significant elevation in levels of IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, p\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a02i), consistent with previously described effects of large volume aspiration25.

Immunostaining for caspase 3, a marker of early apoptosis, showed numerous apoptotic cells throughout injured lungs 6\u2009h after gastric aspiration, while apoptotic cells were very rarely observed in control lungs (Fig.\u00a02m). Pathologic assessments were performed in a randomized and blinded fashion according to a previously established protocol24,26,27 (Supplementary Table\u00a06) to obtain lung injury scores of injured and control lungs at baseline and 6\u2009h after gastric aspiration. Injured lungs received significantly higher injury scores than control lungs across all injury categories (Fig.\u00a02n; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01k)."

Analysis of BAL fluid from injured lungs demonstrated significant decreases in turbidity, sediment (gastric contents, airway secretions, and debris), proteinaceous contents, and cell counts (0\u2009h, 1816\u2009\u00b1\u2009244 cells; 36\u2009h, 120\u2009\u00b1\u200931 cells; p\u2009<\u20090.001) over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013c). The concentration of pepsin in BAL fluid from injured lungs also decreased significantly over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (0\u2009h, 111.9\u2009\u00b1\u200943.2\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121; 36\u2009h, 5.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while the pH (0\u2009h, 4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2) normalized to the pH of BAL fluid from control lungs (5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1) by 12\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03d, e).

                        "Interestingly, the concentration of exosomes in BAL fluid from injured lungs was significantly elevated at 12\u2009h of cross-circulation (injured, 8.96\u2009\u00d7\u20091015\u2009\u00b1\u20092.24\u2009\u00d7\u20091015 particles mL\u22121; control, 4.88\u2009\u00d7\u20091014\u2009\u00b1\u20093.90\u2009\u00d7\u20091014 particles mL\u22121; p\u2009<\u20090.01) but trended downward between 12 and 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03g). Correlation between injury/inflammation and exosome concentration has been previously reported in other pathologic conditions28,29, and these results suggest that the concentration of exosomes in BAL fluid may serve as a diagnostic marker of extracorporeal lung injury and recovery. Exosomes in BAL fluids from injured and control lungs had comparable mean diameters and size distributions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f). In parallel, the effect of interventional cross-circulation on the inflammatory response in injured lungs was analyzed by quantification of cytokines in BAL fluid. GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, M30, and TNF\u03b1 all decreased over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03h, Supplementary Table\u00a09, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c).",
                        "Following airway lavage, exogenous surfactant was delivered via video bronchoscopy into each lobe of injured lungs (Fig.\u00a03i, j; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08g), and was observed advancing distally through the airway tree during positive pressure ventilation, consistent with the transport and deposition of liquid plugs through small airways30,31 (Supplementary Movie\u00a05). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of abundant surfactant in distal airspaces (Fig.\u00a03k; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08h). Dynamic compliance of injured lungs consistently increased after surfactant delivery and throughout the duration of interventional cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03l). Following surfactant replacement, alveolar recruitment maneuvers were performed by adjusting ventilator settings to recruit additional lung volumes32,33. Gross imaging of the lung surface (Fig.\u00a03m, Supplementary Movie\u00a06) and histologic analysis (Fig.\u00a03n) showed that atelectatic regions throughout the injured lung were successfully recruited over 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation. Peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) during standard ventilation gradually decreased from 20.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 cmH2O to 11.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 cmH2O over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03o), consistent with lung recovery and recruitment of additional lung volumes."

                        "Injured lungs had sizable areas of consolidation and discoloration suggestive of pulmonary edema and hemorrhage that were reduced after 18\u2009h and resolved after 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a05a; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c). Radiography revealed severe unilateral injury with marked lobar and multi-focal opacities and the presence of air bronchograms throughout injured lungs (Fig.\u00a05b; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d), while contralateral control lungs maintained normal radiographic appearance. Progressive clearance was observed throughout interventional cross-circulation, with recovery of aerated lung volume in injured lungs after 36\u2009h.Fig. 5Multi-scale analysis of extracorporeal lung recovery.

                        "Thermography was used to assess global and local changes in lung surface temperatures throughout 36\u2009h of cross-circulation. Injured and contralateral control lungs were rewarmed in the normothermic organ chamber and achieved steady state surface temperatures within 30\u2009min of reperfusion (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03l, m; Supplementary Movie\u00a03). Notably, through 18\u2009h of cross-circulation, injured lungs showed more heterogeneous and elevated surface temperatures compared to contralateral regions of control lungs (Fig.\u00a05c; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a). Regions of injured lungs with elevated surface temperatures correlated with areas of consolidation and hemorrhage, consistent with perfused parenchyma with diminished ventilation. After 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, no significant differences in surface temperatures were observed across injured lungs or between injured and control lungs (Fig.\u00a05c, d; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a, b). These results suggest that surface thermography is a useful diagnostic imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of extracorporeal lung recovery.",
                        "Lung surface regions (diameter: 8\u2009mm) were topically cooled by contact with a hypothermic probe (Fig.\u00a05f; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c, d). In control lungs, surface temperatures returned to baseline within 20\u2009s (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08e), while injured lungs consistently demonstrated protracted recovery, requiring more than 45\u2009s to return to baseline (Fig.\u00a05g; Supplementary Movie\u00a07). Differences in surface temperatures between topically cooled regions and surrounding areas were quantified using video thermography and image analysis software. Temperature differences decreased exponentially over time (Fig.\u00a05e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a08f), with time constants for injured lungs (0\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200971.4\u2009s; 12\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200939.1\u2009s; 24\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200938.5\u2009s; 36\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200936.2\u2009s) gradually decreasing to values of time constants for control lungs (0\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200933.3\u2009s; 12\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200930.3\u2009s; 24\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200932.2\u2009s; 36\u2009h, \u03c4\u2009=\u200930.3\u2009s). These results suggest that in addition to global surface thermography, regional thermodynamic imaging may be a useful diagnostic tool for real-time, non-invasive assessment of extracorporeal organs to identify and monitor injury resulting in ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch.",
                        "The airways of injured lungs were inflamed and clearly distinguishable from airways of control lungs. After 18\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation, airway bronchoscopy showed reduced erythema of injured airways, with resolving inflammation of the bronchial mucosa (Fig.\u00a05k). After 36\u2009h, only minimal residual inflammation was observed in airways of injured lungs. Histologic analyses of control lungs revealed normal tissue histomorphology with intact columnar bronchial epithelium and alveolar architecture, and no evidence of pulmonary edema or inflammation throughout 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f, 7c), consistent with previous studies wherein our group demonstrated robust maintenance of healthy lungs over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation support24.",
                        "In contrast, injured lungs displayed pervasive inflammation and disruption of the lung parenchyma, with extensive airway congestion, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, leukocyte infiltration, leakage of lymphatic and plasma proteins, and cellular debris (Fig.\u00a05h, 0\u2009h). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed severe tissue derangement, exudation, and loss of stereotypical saccular structures (Fig.\u00a05i, 0\u2009h), with alveolar spaces containing particulate debris, extravascular erythrocytes consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar septal thickening, neutrophil extravasation, and an impaired blood\u2013gas barrier with severely compromised respiratory epithelium, disruption of type I pneumocyte cell membranes, and atypical cytomorphology of type II pneumocytes (Fig.\u00a05j, 0\u2009h; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). Markers of injury were drastically reduced after 18\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation, with evidence of partial restoration of the alveolar epithelial lining, and complete resolution by 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a05h\u2013j, 36\u2009h; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b).",
                        "Pathologic assessment of injured and control lungs was performed in a randomized blinded fashion to obtain categorical and composite lung injury scores according to a previously established scoring rubric24 (Supplementary Table\u00a06). Lung injury was evaluated by quantification of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells in airways and alveoli, early and late apoptotic cells, interstitial and alveolar edema, and interstitial infiltrates (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Lung injury scores trended downward in all categories over 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a05l; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05g). Apoptosis was the lung injury category with the most significant reduction in injury score, decreasing from 3.0 at initiation to 0.3 after 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation. Control lungs showed no changes in categorical or composite lung injury scores across 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a05l; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05h). The difference in composite lung injury scores between injured and control lungs decreased throughout 36\u2009h of cross-circulation from 12.1 to 5.7 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05i), suggesting a high degree of lung recovery."

                        "Silver reticulin staining of injured lungs demonstrated dense cellular debris and mucus within the bronchial lumen, peribronchial edema, and consolidation of alveoli, consistent with severe acute lung injury and disruption of the pulmonary epithelium. Alcian blue staining showed abundant trans-epithelial migration of neutrophils into the airway lumen through pseudostratified airway epithelium, and apparent loss of secretory vesicles containing mucus in goblet cells. Periodic acid-Schiff and pentachrome staining showed damaged, discontinuous columnar epithelium with exposed basement membrane, inflammatory cells, and loss of airway cilia (Fig.\u00a06a). After 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, conducting airways of injured lungs exhibited resolution of edema and inflammation, clearance of luminal debris consistent with the histologic appearance of proximal airways in control lungs, trace evidence of neutrophil infiltration, presence of mucus-filled granules in goblet cells, and intact columnar epithelium with reconstituted ciliated brush border (Fig.\u00a06a). In the respiratory zone of injured lungs, retention of structural fibers in the alveolar extracellular matrix, clearance of alveolar edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, absence of extravascular erythrocytes, reduced perivascular edema, and restored vascular histomorphology were observed (Fig.\u00a06b, c).Fig. 6Cellular recovery and regeneration of injured lungs.

                        "Injured lungs also contained significantly more neutrophils than control lungs, with significantly greater myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in injured lung parenchyma (Fig.\u00a06d, e). By 18\u2009h of cross-circulation, neutrophil numbers and MPO activity were significantly decreased and maintained within normal ranges through 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, consistent with histologic evaluations (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c). Additionally, the number of CD163+ macrophages in injured lungs decreased to normal (control) levels by 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06f). Over the same period, the high initial levels of caspase 3 and TUNEL significantly decreased, and apoptotic cells were rarely observed in injured lungs, indicating clearance of dying and dead cells (Fig.\u00a06g; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a, b). Interestingly, mitochondrial activity showed no significant differences in metabolism of injured or control lungs during 36\u2009h of cross-circulation support (Fig.\u00a06h).",
                        "As aspiration of gastric contents incurs a severe chemical injury to the respiratory epithelium, especially to the type I pneumocytes that comprise the majority of the alveolar surface34, the integrity of the alveolar epithelium was assessed. Expression of aquaporin 5, an integral membrane protein that functions as a water channel and marker of type I pneumocytes, was largely lost following aspiration of gastric contents but recovered during interventional cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a06i; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). Initially, total depletion of epithelial tight junctions (zonula occludens-3, ZO-3) and loss of barrier function was observed in injured lungs, but the number of tight junctions increased by 18\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a06j; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d). Expression of surfactant protein C (SPC), a marker of type II pneumocytes, was negligible in injured lungs but became increasingly abundant by 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, with clear punctate distributions suggesting normal intracellular localization within lamellar bodies (Fig.\u00a06k; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07e). Viability and function of type II pneumocytes after 36\u2009h of cross-circulation were confirmed by uptake of BODIPY-labeled surfactant protein B (BODIPY-SPB) delivered into distal regions of injured lungs (Fig.\u00a06m).",
                        "Regeneration of pulmonary endothelium after aspiration of gastric contents was also assessed by analysis of the injured pulmonary vascular network, including microvascular tight and gap junctions. Immunostaining for zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) revealed dramatic loss of tight junctions throughout the pulmonary microvasculature following injury, but recovery to normal expression levels24 after 36\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a06n; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d). Quantification of gap junction alpha-1 protein (connexin 43), a component of gap junctions that enables critical intercellular interactions, showed a similar trend of recovery to previously reported expression levels in healthy controls35 (Fig.\u00a06o). Disruption of the alveolar epithelial lining and the presence of inflammatory cells, extravascular erythrocytes, and extracellular debris confirmed lung injury and a compromised blood\u2013gas barrier (Fig.\u00a06r; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). After 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, the pulmonary microvasculature of injured lungs appeared intact by immunostaining for CD31 (Fig.\u00a06q), and the transmission electron micrographs (Fig.\u00a06r; Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b) resembled those of control lungs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c), with clear restoration of the alveolar epithelial lining and intraseptal capillary geometry and architecture (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). Viability of the pulmonary endothelium after 36\u2009h of cross-circulation was confirmed by uptake of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Fig.\u00a06s) and acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL; Fig.\u00a06t)."

                "We describe the application of interventional cross-circulation\u2014a strategy for prolonged, systemically regulated normothermic extracorporeal organ support\u2014to regenerate severely damaged lungs (Supplementary Movie\u00a01). Our results suggest that lungs injured by gastric aspiration, a common lung injury rendering donor lungs unsuitable for transplantation: (i) can be maintained on cross-circulation support without decline in lung function or tissue integrity, (ii) are amenable to repeated therapeutic interventions, and (iii) display evidence of cellular regeneration and improved function over the course of 36\u2009h.",
                "Aspiration of gastric contents was used as an injury model due to its: (i) reproducibility and established protocols21,36, (ii) severity of functional decline and tissue derangement, and (iii) clinical relevance in the context of acute lung injury and lung transplantation. Lung injury occurs in two distinct phases37. In the first phase (0\u20132\u2009h after aspiration), damage results in the disruption of alveolar type I cell membranes and increased microvascular permeability. Alterations in the blood\u2013gas barrier lead to extravasation of fluid and protein into the airways and alveoli, leading to pulmonary edema, decreased compliance, and progressive hypoxia38. In the second phase (2\u20136\u2009h after aspiration), an inflammatory cascade results in neutrophil migration and the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 by activated alveolar macrophages39,40. These processes in conjunction with the release of reactive oxygen species, free radicals, and proteases by infiltrating immune cells41,42 exacerbate lung injury.",
                "Normothermic cross-circulation allowed for 36\u2009h of repeated therapeutic interventions (Fig.\u00a01b) that aided in the recovery of damaged lungs. Airway lavage was effective in ameliorating the caustic effects of gastric aspiration by removing particulate and cellular debris43 and by neutralizing pH, thereby decreasing proteolytic enzyme concentration and activity (Fig.\u00a03, a\u2013h). While the delivery of exogenous surfactants effectively replenishes depleted and degraded endogenous surfactants and improves compliance44, beneficial effects only occur after inhibitory plasma proteins and fluid are removed by lavage45. Accordingly, in our therapeutic intervention regimen, surfactant replacement was performed after bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers improve ventilation\u2013perfusion matching and arterial oxygenation46, and have been shown to improve clinical outcomes47. Administration of surfactant enhances the spatial distribution of lung ventilation via recruitment, which recovers gas exchange48 through restoration of ventilation\u2013perfusion match.",
                "Pepsin, a biomarker of gastric aspiration49,50, has recently been linked to allograft injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in transplant patients51. Pepsin-induced cytotoxicity and release of IL-6 and IL-8 peaks at pH 1.5\u20132.552. After 12\u2009h of cross-circulation and repeated bronchoalveolar lavage, pepsin concentrations in BAL fluid significantly decreased, pH of BAL fluid normalized to pH\u2009>\u20095, and IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations decreased significantly (Fig.\u00a03, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Elevated levels of IL-8 in BAL fluid perpetuate aspiration injury via IL-8 dependent mechanisms53,54. Notably, initially high levels of IL-8 in injured lungs normalized to control levels after 12\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation. Similarly, levels of other key inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1) decreased significantly in BAL fluid from injured lungs over the course of 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a03h, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c, Supplementary Table\u00a09). Gastric aspiration also increases susceptibility to respiratory pathogens and bacterial infections55,56. Microbial cultures of BAL fluids from injured and control lungs contained normal respiratory flora and were negative for pathologic growth, demonstrating that repeated interventions in extracorporeal lungs can be performed without introducing pathogens.",
                "Over 36\u2009h of cross-circulation, injured lungs showed recovery of mechanical compliance to 68% of the average compliance of control lungs\u2014a more than six-fold improvement. Significant changes in pressure\u2013volume (PV) loops were consistent with this degree of recovery and did not resemble stereotypical PV loop hysteresis until after 24\u2009h of cross-circulation (Fig.\u00a04a, b). The initial average PaO2/FiO2 of injured lungs was <90\u2009mmHg (11% of the average PaO2/FiO2 in control lungs) and increased to >640\u2009mmHg (83% of the average PaO2/FiO2 in control lungs). Notably, following 36\u2009h of cross-circulation there was no significant difference between the PaO2/FiO2 of injured and control lungs (Fig.\u00a04c).",
                "Lung injury scores consistently decreased across all categories, with the greatest reductions in alveolar PMN cells, edema, and apoptosis (Fig.\u00a05l, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05g\u2013i; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Notably, we demonstrated: (i) longitudinal expression and regeneration of cell surface markers of the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium, and tight and gap junction proteins, (ii) recovery of functional subcellular structures (e.g., intracellular vesicles), and (iii) cellular function and integrity throughout 36\u2009h of extracorporeal support (Fig.\u00a06).",
                "Acute lung injury affects the alveolar epithelium and microvascular endothelium, and specifically reduces the expression of aquaporin 5, which plays an essential role in water transport57. Following aspiration, aquaporin 5 was drastically reduced in injured lungs. After 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation, aquaporin 5 expression was similar in injured and control lungs (Fig.\u00a06i, Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). Additionally, epithelial tight junction protein ZO-3 and microvascular tight junction protein ZO-1 displayed similar expression patterns of recovery, with very low initial levels and significantly higher levels reaching those in control lungs after 36\u2009h of cross-circulation. These data, along with decreased lung weight (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05e), improved gas exchange and compliance (Fig.\u00a04), and decreased alveolar edema observed by light and electron microscopy (Figs.\u00a05, 6), strongly suggest that interventional cross-circulation enabled significant cellular regeneration in the airway and vascular compartments, resulting in functional restoration of the alveolar-capillary membrane in extracorporeal lungs.",
                "Decrease in surfactant protein C, a marker of type II pneumocytes58, in distal regions of injured lungs resulted in the loss of surfactant-filled lamellar bodies in type II cells. After 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation, significant increases in SPC expression and restoration of intracellular surfactant-filled lamellar bodies were observed (Fig.\u00a06k, l). Airway regeneration was demonstrated by the restoration of: (i) contiguous type I cell membranes, (ii) a ciliated epithelial brush border, and (iii) subcellular structures including mucus-filled vesicles in airway goblet cells and surfactant-filled lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells. These data suggest extensive epithelial cellular regeneration in the airway that has not been demonstrated by other lung support systems (Supplementary Table\u00a01\u20133). In addition, increased expression of connexin 43 (Fig.\u00a06o, p) correlated with the recovery of severely damaged lungs over 36\u2009h of support, during which the injured pulmonary vascular network not only remained viable but also substantially regenerated. We hypothesize that the degree of cellular regeneration achieved is the result of the beneficial effects of therapeutic interventions, physiologic homeostatic maintenance and prolonged support provided by cross-circulation with a living host.",
                "The present study has several limitations: (1) While the use of inbred swine enabled recovery and regeneration of injured lungs with minimal donor\u2013recipient immunologic cross-reactivity, future studies will need to assess the effects of immunosuppression (necessary for lung transplantation) on lung recovery. (2) This study assessed recovery from lung injury 6\u2009h after gastric aspiration, a period within which a severe inflammatory response develops. Clinically, aspiration events often precede interventional recovery by more than 6\u2009h, and additional studies are needed to extend this approach to lungs enduring a longer exposure to aspiration pneumonitis. Nevertheless, the injury model and therapeutic regimen used in this study may also represent an opportunity to inform clinical practice in cases of known or suspected gastric aspiration (e.g., in trauma patients, patients found down prior to admission to the hospital, or patients intubated in the field by first responders). (3) To maintain appropriate controls, only a single lung was injured in each experiment, while in the clinical setting, patients frequently develop bilateral aspiration pneumonitis. (4) According to multiple assessment criteria, including radiography, pressure\u2013volume loops, compliance, histologic analyses, lung injury scores, and cell-specific functional markers such as aquaporin 5 and surfactant protein C, injured lungs improved to reach transplantation criteria, but did not achieve full recovery. Future studies should investigate the functional capacity of lungs following transplantation, and if longer support and recovery times would be of greater benefit.",
                "Beyond demonstrating extracorporeal regeneration of severely damaged lungs, this study resulted in the development of technical methodologies. During ex vivo organ perfusion, advanced thermography59 can be used for the identification of flow and circuit failures60, and enable real-time visualization of rewarming during lung reperfusion24. We extended thermography to assessing global surface temperatures and conducting localized thermal recovery tests as a diagnostic for non-invasive evaluations of injured extracorporeal lungs. We also found that exosome concentrations in BAL fluids from injured lungs were elevated and increased over the first 12\u2009h of cross-circulation. As injured lungs recovered, exosome concentrations decreased and approached levels in control lungs (Fig.\u00a03g). Profiling of exosome surface markers and cargo was beyond the scope of this study but represents an opportunity for future investigation, as exosomes in BAL fluid may represent a biomarker to diagnose, grade, and monitor the trajectory of lung injury and recovery.",
                "Envisioned clinical applications of an interventional cross-circulation platform are motivated by the thousands of patients who die every year awaiting suitable organs for transplantation. The recovery of an unsuitable organ may represent their only chance for transplantation and survival. We envision that prolonged extracorporeal support by interventional cross-circulation could be used to recover and regenerate severely damaged organs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). Furthermore, as humanized swine and immunosuppressive regimens are being developed for applications in xenotransplantation, the utility of a non-human host should also be assessed in a xenogeneic cross-circulation system for the recovery of human donor organs unacceptable for transplantation.",
                "In summary, we report: (i) the development of an interventional extracorporeal organ support platform capable of systemic regulation, (ii) the use of non-invasive diagnostics (dynamic surface thermography, exosomes), and (iii) evidence of cellular regeneration of severely damaged extracorporeal lungs. Furthermore, we demonstrate: longitudinal expression and regeneration of cell markers of the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium, recovery of functional subcellular structures, and cellular function and integrity throughout 36\u2009h of interventional cross-circulation. Our results also establish a benchmark for molecular and cellular analytics of extracorporeal lung regeneration (Supplementary Table\u00a04). We envision that interventional cross-circulation may be used to investigate regeneration of other damaged organs (e.g., hearts, kidneys, livers), where expansion of donor pools through the salvage of severely damaged organs could lead to more organ transplantations."

Temporary changes in ventilation settings (minute ventilation and FiO2) were made according to a lung performance challenge protocol in order to further assess extracorporeal lung performance every 6\u2009h. Immediately following the challenge, a subsequent set of blood samples were drawn from the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein cannulas. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn\u2009=\u2009TV/(PIP \u2013 PEEP); mL cmH2O\u22121) of extracorporeal lungs was calculated every 6\u2009h. Pressure and volume recordings of lungs were measured using a custom measurement system consisting of sensors for pressure and airflow and a data acquisition device (Arduino Uno). Data collected with this system were processed, and pressure\u2013volume loops were generated using MATLAB v. R2016b (Mathworks). Lung weight was obtained every 6\u2009h using the top-loading scale (Denver Instrument Company) within the organ chamber. To ensure accurate recordings, the basin and contents were tared (zeroed) at each time point. X-ray images of lungs were obtained using a PXP-16HF portable X-ray unit (United Radiology Systems) at 2.2 mAs and 90 kVp."

Next, lung samples were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in Sorenson\u2019s buffer for 1\u2009h, and following dehydration, tissues were embedded in Lx-112 (Ladd Research Industries). Sectioning was performed on a PT-XL ultramicrotome (60\u2009nm thickness). Samples were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Images capture was performed using an ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu) and recorded with AMT Image Capture Engine v.602.569."

Our hypothesis was that cross-circulation could provide a sufficiently robust level of extracorporeal support to enable multiple therapeutic interventions and recovery of extracorporeal lung function. The study was conducted with the minimum number of animals needed to demonstrate reproducibility and achieve statistical significance between time points. Data from this initial study will be used to conduct power analysis for subsequent investigations. Collection of all samples was performed as technical replicates in triplicate."
