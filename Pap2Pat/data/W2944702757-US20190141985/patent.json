    "abstract": "Described are systems, methods, and devices relating to normothermic extracorporeal support of an organ, tissue, or bioengineered graft comprising cross-circulation (XC) perfusion for prolonged periods (days to weeks) via an XC perfusion circuit in connection with an extracorporeal host (e.g., animal, patient, organ transplant recipient) are disclosed. The XC perfusion circuit comprises auto-regulation of blood flow based on the trans-organ blood pressure difference between arterial and venous pressure. Recipient support enabled 36 h of normothermic perfusion that maintained healthy lungs with no significant changes in physiologic parameters and allowed for the recovery of injured lungs. Extended support enabled multiscale therapeutic interventions in all extracorporeal lungs. Lungs exceeded transplantation criteria.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Since about 1970, organ transplantation to treat terminal illnesses has become routine, although still rare. Transplants procedures for heart, lung, kidney, liver, small intestine and pancreas organs have been developed. For example, end-stage lung disease has a profound socioeconomic impact and remains the third leading cause of death worldwide. Twenty-five million Americans suffer from end-stage lung disease and 400,000 patients die every year. Lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment, but the number of transplants is limited by shortage of transplantable donor lungs. However, donor organ demand far exceeds supply, and due to stringent listing criteria, the actual demand is probably underestimated. Currently, four out of five donor lungs are deemed unacceptable for transplantation at the time of donation, making lung the least utilized solid organ and necessitating the increasing use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge-to-transplant for critically ill patients. In 2015 there were only 1,854 lung transplants in the U.S.A.",
                        "To address these challenges, there are major initiatives worldwide to increase the number of transplantable lungs, including the following: (1) Criteria expansion: the use of donors older than 55 years, or lungs donated following cardiac deaths; (2) Extracorporeal devices: ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) to recondition marginally unacceptable donor lungs; (3) Bioengineered lungs: tissue-engineering strategies utilizing stem cells and fully decellularized or bioartificial scaffolds to develop functional lungs de novo; (4) Xenogeneic lungs: genomic and immunologic alterations to enable the xenotransplantation of swine or non-human primate lungs, thereby providing a constant supply of donor organs. However, despite these efforts, the annual number of lung transplantations remains steady, and waitlist mortality continues to rise. Among current approaches, EVLP may hold the greatest promise for immediate clinical impact. The utility of commercially available EVLP systems for recovery of marginally unacceptable donor lungs is under investigation in clinical trials, and several have already employed EVLP before lung transplantation. Nevertheless, the number of lungs recovered using EVLP remains limited, and may be insufficient to meet the growing demand.",
                        "Current organ preservation techniques typically involve hypothermic storage of the organ in a chemical preservation solution on ice. These techniques utilize a variety of solutions, none of which sufficiently protect the organ from damage resulting from ischemia. Such injuries are particularly undesirable when an organ is intended to be transplanted from a donor into a recipient.",
                        "Effective physiologic preservation of an ex vivo or extracorporeal organ would provide important benefits compared to conventional approaches. For instance, physiologic ex vivo preservation would permit more careful monitoring, functional testing, assessment, and therapy of the harvested organ. This would in turn allow earlier detection and potential repair of defects in the harvested organ, further reducing the likelihood of post-transplant organ failure. The ability to perform and assess simple repairs on the organ would also allow many organs with minor defects to be saved, whereas current transplantation techniques require them to be discarded. This may be critically important when harvesting lungs because lungs are easily compromised even before harvesting within the donor's body.",
                        "In addition, more effective matching between the organ and a particular recipient may be achieved, further reducing the likelihood of eventual organ rejection. Current transplantation techniques rely mainly on matching donor and recipient blood types, which by itself is a relatively unreliable indicator of whether or not the organ will be rejected by the recipient. A more preferred test for organ compatibility is a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching test, but current cold ischemic organ preservation approaches preclude the use of this test, which can often require 12 hours or more to complete.",
                        "Using conventional approaches, injuries caused by ischemia increase as a function of the length of time an organ is maintained ex vivo. For example, a lung may typically be preserved ex vivo for only about 6 to about 8 hours before it becomes unusable for transplantation. A heart typically may be preserved ex vivo for only about 4 to about 6 hours before it becomes unusable for transplantation. These relatively brief time periods limit the number of recipients who can be reached from a given donor site, thereby restricting the recipient pool for a harvested organ. Even within the time limits, the organs may nevertheless be significantly damaged. A significant issue is that there may not be any observable indication of the damage. Because of this, less-than-optimal organs may be transplanted, resulting in post-transplant organ dysfunction or other injuries. Thus, it would be desirable to develop techniques that can extend the time during which an organ can be preserved in a healthy state ex vivo. Such techniques would reduce the risk of post-transplant organ failure and enlarge potential donor and recipient pools.",
                        "Prolonged and reliable ex vivo organ care would also provide benefits outside the context of organ transplantation. For example, a patient's body, as a whole, can typically tolerate much lower levels of chemo-, bio- and radiation therapy than many particular organs. An ex vivo organ care system would permit an organ to be removed from the body and treated in isolation, reducing the risk of damage to other parts of the body.",
                        "Conventional extracorporeal organ support systems are closed circuits that rely on re-circulation of a perfused fluid (e.g., blood, organ preservation solution). Closed re-perfusion systems lack the ability to maintain physiologic homeostasis, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites and waste products that have deleterious effects on organ function and viability. Such effects strictly limit the duration of extracorporeal organ support to approximately 12 hours\u2014a prohibitively short duration of time to intervene (e.g., to treat infections with antibiotics, improve organ function by clearing inflammation or repairing injuries, regenerate organ with gene or cell therapies) in an extracorporeal organ or tissue. Extended duration of extracorporeal support (greater than 24 hours) allows for intervention and recovery of otherwise unusable donor organs, thereby significantly expanding the pool of transplantable donor organs, as well providing a means for modifying the donor organ.",
                        "In view of the foregoing, improved systems, methods, and devices for caring for an organ ex vivo are needed.",
                        "Notably, clinical EVLP systems are approved to support lungs for up to 6 h, a time too short for recovery of lungs beyond the marginally unacceptable range and for advanced therapeutic interventions (for example, pharmacotherapy, immunomodulation and gene/cell therapy). The physiologic limitations of EVLP can be attributed to the absence of systemic regulation (for example, renal, hepatic, pancreatic, neurohormonal). Even with repeated exchanges of perfusate, the loss of homeostasis in the extracorporeal lung inevitably leads to cellular damage, pulmonary oedema, impaired gas exchange and deterioration of lung function."

                        "Most donor lungs and many other organs are rejected for transplant after operative assessment during harvest. This invention enables long term preservation (days to weeks) of organs with the maintenance of viability and function with direct donor-host assessment. Such capability is provided for a number of different organs using essentially the same technology. The times are sufficient for various types of intervention (conditioning, oxygenation, cell removal and delivery, gene correction and many others). The invention may enable an increased pool of organs for transplant by allowing for recovery, regeneration, and maintenance of viable and functional donor organs and tissues over times sufficient for therapeutic intervention, including but not limited to: conditioning prior to transplant, gene transfer to correct disease, cell removal/delivery. Additional applications include but are not limited to studies in xenotransplantation and drug therapy.",

Additional research applications include but are not limited to studies in xenotransplantation, theranostics, organ physiology, drug therapy and stem cell therapy.",
                        "The system may be used for cross-circulation between the organ recipient and the donor organ. The system may also be applied using a healthy animal (e.g. a normal animal for research uses or an optionally humanized animal for clinical uses) in place of the organ recipient (patient) as the cross-circulation host.",
                        "The system provides for the functional recovery of donor lungs injured by ischemia reperfusion (in a large animal model), and may be used to recover lungs more severely damaged by gastric aspiration or other physical or physiologic insults. Applications of the system disclosed herein may provide for the recovery of injured human donor organs specifically using an animal (e.g., pig) genetically modified to have reduced immunologic interaction with human organs or tissues, i.e., a humanized animal \u2018bioreactor\u2019 or human-xenogeneic bioreactor.",

The benefits conferred to the extracorporeal organ by cross-circulation with a porcine organ-porcine recipient system or human organ-human recipient system may be similar for a human organ-xenogeneic recipient system. This human-xenogeneic bioreactor support system would also be applicable to other transplantable organs, grafts, and bioengineered tissues.",
                        "The human-xenogeneic bioreactor may provide significantly expanded ability to recover a greater number of injured donor organs.

Envisioned uses of cross-circulation between an organ recipient and extracorporeal organ include rescue of donor organs unacceptable for transplantation, salvage of traumatized limbs, or support of bioengineered or xenogeneic organ grafts. Both conventional EVLP and cross-circulation allow for administration of energy substrates, maintenance of barrier integrity, organ function assessment and oedema clearance. Cross circulation infusion offers extended extracorporeal support (greater than 24 hours and a greater range of therapies compared to conventional isolated ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), providing an extended period of extracorporeal organ viability for organs prior to transplant. Benefits that cross-circulation of a recipient's blood confers to the extracorporeal organ include increased recovery time, the ability to provide energy substrates, circulating repair factors, metabolic clearance, and allow for extended immunological and graft performance assessment.",
                        "Cross circulation perfusion also enables a variety of therapeutic interventions, including medication, drug nanoparticles, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, decellularization cell replacement and inflammatory modulation, in donor organs unacceptable for transplantation, which could significantly expand donor organ pools by allowing recovery of organs and tissues that were previously unacceptable for transplantation. For example, this is the first technology that allows the maintenance of human lungs outside the body without oedema for days to weeks, which provides a viable platform for genetic and phenotypic modification of the organ to improve compatibility matching. Delivery of bioactive or therapeutic agents to the extracorporeal lung can be by intratracheal delivery of CFSE, microbeads, and stem cells (including mesenchymal stem cells) for example. Native cells can be harvested, de-epithelilialized and recellularized for decellularization cell replacement therapy. Transpleural imaging can be used to examine the extracorporeal lung and/or guide delivery of agents to specific portions of the lung.",
                        "The present embodiments demonstrated successful maintenance of organ function, tissue architecture, and cellular/microscopic integrity of an extracorporeal organ (lung) for at least 36 hours. Such results were enabled by the system (i.e., setup and circuit) of cross-circulation between a host and an extracorporeal organ described herein. This represents unprecedented results with respect to quality and duration of organ preservation and performance after 36 hours outside the body. After 36 hours, all lungs were shown to meet transplant criteria.",
                        "To overcome the limitations of EVLP, we developed a \u2018cross-circulation\u2019 platform using a clinically relevant swine model. Early attempts at cross-circulation between two humans utilized a healthy individual to support and augment the organ function of a patient suffering from a critical but potentially reversible illness given sufficient time for recovery (for example, hepatic insufficiency, uraemia, eclampsia).",

The clamps are capable of occluding blood and/or plasma flow, effectively isolating the recipient from the extracorporeal circuit, to protect the safety of the patient in the event of the detection of unsafe pressures, flows, or bubbles in the extracorporeal circuit. The clamps may be configured on the outside of the flexible tubing or fluid conduit of the cross-circulation circuit to squeeze or pinch the tubing to occlude blood and/or plasma flow. Alternatively the clamping function may be achieved by valves in the fluid conduit. The clamps are preferably operated automatically by actuators controlled by electronic processor(s) that determines whether an unsafe condition occurs by processing signals from the sensors. The processor may be configured to report conditions in the cross-circulation circuit to a remote device such as a computer or database.

Lungs were explanted and, before cross-circulation, they were subjected to either isolated EVLP (prolonged maintenance group) or static cold ischaemia (ischaemic recovery group). The table shows timelines of prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery experimental groups.",
                        "Donor lungs were collected in the standard fashion, and the pulmonary artery (PA), pulmonary vein (PV) and trachea were cannulated as shown in FIG. 7C. The challenge of collecting venous return from multiple pulmonary veins following removal of the left atrium (FIG. 7B) was managed via the implementation of a vascular bio-bridge (7E) and a custom crenellated cannula (FIG. 10B). In the prolonged maintenance group, a conventional EVLP circuit was primed with donor blood collected during lung harvest, and EVLP was initiated. In the ischaemic recovery group, lungs were maintained at 4\u00b0 C. for 18 h before initiation of EVLP. In both experimental groups, a recipient swine was placed under general anaesthesia, and the internal jugular veins were cannulated and connected to the EVLP circuit to achieve cross-circulation between the recipient and the extracorporeal lung. After 24 h of normothermic cross-circulation support, multiple experimental interventions were demonstrated until procedures were terminated as planned at 36 h of cross-circulation support.",
                        "Target parameters were defined for extracorporeal lung perfusion and ventilation for both experimental groups. Extracorporeal lung perfusion and ventilation target parameters include: PA pressure, <20 mmHg; PV pressure, 3-5 mmHg; flow, 0.2-0.4 lmin\u22121 (5-10% of cardiac output); temperature, 36-38C; respiratory rate, 6-8 bpm; fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), 40%. FIG. 6B shows the use of height differences to modulate extracorporeal blood flow (arrows) by circuit hydrostatic pressure differences. Integrated circuit elements (FIG. 2A) enabled real-time monitoring and maintenance of pressure, flow and temperature. In addition to feedback-regulated pressure-limited flow, modulation of the trans-pulmonary pressure gradient was achieved by precisely maintaining hydrostatic pressures by regulating the heights of the lung, blood reservoir and recipient. Thermal imaging confirmed that warm, freshly explanted lungs placed on ice were efficiently cooled with cold flush (in keeping with standard transplantation protocol, and warmed to normothermia following reperfusion after transfer to the warm, humidified organ chamber.",

Biochemical analysis included measurement of white blood cells, platelets Hemoglobin/Hematocrit levels, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate and glucose. Haemolytic markers measured included lactate dehydrogenase, activated clotting time, D-dimer, fibrinogen and plasma-free haemoglobin. Pro-inflammatory markers included IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 TNF\u03b1 and Angiotensin II. Anti-inflammatory markers included IL-10 and activation markers P-selectin and M30 were also measured for recipients during prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery. No significant changes (p>0.05) in serum levels of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines or activation markers were detected between 0 and 36 h of cross-circulation for recipients in the prolonged maintenance or ischaemic recovery groups.",
                        "The median weight of recipient animals (n=6) was 41.4 kg (range: 38.0-70.4 kg). Recipients were under general anaesthesia for an average of 40.1\u00b11.5 h. All recipients remained haemodynamically stable throughout the duration of cross-circulation support, in normal sinus rhythm, and without the need for vasopressor support. There were no significant differences between the respective baseline and end-point values for lactate (1.52\u00b10.49 mM and 0.71\u00b10.31 mM), pH (7.48\u00b10.07 and 7.36\u00b10.05), or the oxygen partial pressure, pO2 (530\u00b162 mmHg and 520\u00b181 mmHg). Haemolytic markers (lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, fibrinogen, plasma free haemoglobin) remained within normal ranges. Within each experimental group, no significant changes in serum levels of pro- or anti-inflammatorycytokines were detected between 0 and 36 h of cross-circulation. P-selectin, an indicator of platelet activation and endothelial injury, remained in the normal range throughout the entire procedure for both groups. M30, a marker of epithelial cell death, did not increase significantly in either experimental group. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were initially higher in the ischaemic recovery group and, with the exception of interleukin 1\u03b2 (1\u03b2) and tumor-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), trended downward over time (IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, angiotensin II). Although elevated in the ischaemic recovery group, all cytokine levels were within previously reported normal ranges. While the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased over the first 12 h of cross-circulation before trending downward in the prolonged maintenance group, IL-10 levels were initially higher and remained elevated throughout the 36 h of cross-circulation in the ischaemic recovery group.",

                        "The percentage change of extracorporeal lung weight was monitored throughout cross-circulation procedure. Trans-pulmonary pressure gradient (TPG), the difference between PA and PV pressures was measured. Pressure volume loops during prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery were measured. Dynamic compliance (ml cmH2O\u22121) during prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery was monitored. Clearance of lactate over 36 h of cross-circulation (XC) was observed. Lactate accumulated over the course of 1, 2 and 4 h of EVLP before initiation of cross-circulation. Lactate was cleared within 12 hours of cross circulation perfusion. PaO2/FiO2 ratios during prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery were used to assess the functional capacity of the lungs to oxygenate. The oxygenation ratios were well above the threshold for mild to moderate or severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Blood sampling before and after extracorporeal lung performance challenges, which were defined by adjustments made to ventilation (100% FiO2 and 2\u00d7 minute ventilation) every 4 h for 10-min periods was used to assess changes in pO2 and pCO2 in blood entering and exiting the extracorporeal lung. Responses in \u0394pO2 (4H) and \u0394pCO2 (41) to 10-minute challenges during prolonged maintenance and ischaemic recovery were measured.",
                        "Lung weight in the prolonged maintenance group did not change significantly (0 h, 0.48\u00b10.09 kg; 36 h, 0.43\u00b10.04 kg; p>0.05), whereas lung weight in the ischaemic recovery group decreased significantly over the first 4 h of cross-circulation (0 h, 0.70\u00b10.05 kg; 4 h, 0.53\u00b10.08 kg; p<0.05) and then remained stable over the remaining 32 h (4 h, 0.53\u00b10.08 kg; 36 h, 0.57\u00b10.04 kg; p>0.05). The trans-pulmonary pressure gradient was tightly maintained at 5-15 mm Hg throughout all procedures. No significant changes in pressure-volume loops or dynamic compliance were observed over 36 h of cross-circulation support in the prolonged maintenance group. However, in the ischaemic recovery group, derangement in pressure-volume loops and a corresponding decrease in dynamic compliance was seen at 12 h, followed by normalization of pressure-volume loops by 24 h and compliance values exceeding those at baseline by 36 h. Notably, the build-up of lactate that occurred during the initial EVLP phase (before initiation of cross-circulation) of each experiment in the prolonged maintenance group (1.85 mM at 1 h, 8.20 mM at 2 h and 12.38 mM at 4 h) quickly normalized (<2.5 mM) following initiation of cross-circulation and remained within the normal range. In the prolonged maintenance group, extracorporeal lungs kept at a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% maintained a partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 315\u00b134 mmHg corresponding to a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 821\u00b1102 mmHg. In the ischaemic recovery group, lungs had an initial average PaO2 of 245.6\u00b1133.7 mmHg corresponding to a P/F ratio of 614.16\u00b1334.30 mmHg. Following an initial increase, all lungs experienced a slight decline in function until normalizing after 18 h. In response to the performance challenges of (1) increasing minute ventilation by 100% and (2) increasing FiO2 from 40% to 100%, extracorporeal lungs demonstrated the ability to exchange gas as shown by differences (\u0394) in baseline and challenge levels of pulmonary artery and vein haemogases: ApO2 (oxygenation) and \u0394pCO2 (ventilation). Notably, lungs in the ischaemic recovery group did not achieve \u0394pO2 and \u0394pCO2 values equivalent to lungs in the prolonged maintenance group until after 24 h of cross-circulation.",

                        "Following 18 h of cold ischaemia, lungs demonstrated gross, radiographic and thermographic evidence of consolidation, atelectasis and non-uniform perfusion. Bronchoscopy at the initiation of cross-circulation revealed mild airway oedema and abundant cellular content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. By 24 h of cross-circulation, airway oedema resolved, atelectatic lung was recruited, and lungs were uniformly perfused and remained normal up to 36 h, at which time fewer cells were observed in the BAL fluid. Myeloperoxidase activity, an indicator of neutrophil activation, was elevated at 12 h but was significantly reduced by 36 h (p<0.001). Histologic analysis revealed neutrophil migration and extravasation into the interstitial space surrounding vessels and large airways from 0-12 h, with resolution by 36 h. Following ischaemia-reperfusion, metabolism of extracorporeal lungs significantly increased over 24 h. Microscopic analysis revealed derangements in lung architecture at 0, 6 and 12 h, and intact structural and cellular architecture at 24 and 36 h. Transmission electron microscopy showed denuded basement membrane with gaps between type I pneumocyte cell membranes at 0 and 12 h. By 24 and 36 h, the alveolar blood-gas barrier was shown to be intact. A decrease in ZO-1 was observed at 0 and 12 h, with recovery by 36 h.

Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy of airway casts confirmed the maintenance of a large-airway, bronchiolar and alveolar architecture, pseudostratified epithelium, and secretory function of submucosal mucous glands. Pentachrome staining revealed the presence of fully intact ciliated brush borders in large airways. Live imaging of airway biopsies demonstrated viable cilia with coordinated beating, confirming functional preservation of the mucociliary escalator after 36 h of cross-circulation. Type II pneumocytes were visualized by transmission electron microscopy, and their viability and function at 36 h was confirmed by the uptake of fluorescently labelled BODIPY-SPB. Viability of pseudostratified epithelium in large airways was confirmed by the uptake of bronchoscopically delivered carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE) at 36 h. Immunostaining for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) demonstrated maintenance of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, and epithelial tight junction protein 3 (ZO-3) immunostaining suggested intact barrier function after 36 h of cross-circulation. The pulmonary vasculature was visualized by the injection of a radiocontrast dye at 36 h. Viability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells was confirmed by the uptake of CSFE, and smooth muscle actin immunostaining showed preservation of airway and vascular smooth muscle after 36 h of cross-circulation.

Delivery and uptake of a cell viability marker (CFSE) in target regions of the distal lung was determined. No uptake was observed in blood vessels (bv), interstitium (int) or non-targeted proximal airways (aw). Transpleural imaging setup allowed for non-invasive in situ imaging of microbeads and stem cells delivered to distal lung. Transpleural imaging following therapeutic delivery of microbeads and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was conducted and histologic analysis of delivered MSCs was performed. Global distribution of MSCs throughout lung was observed. MSCs delivered in single cell suspension were localized in alveoli and interstitium. MSCs delivered in aggregate clusters, co-localized with integrin-\u03b2 1. Histologic comparison of native and de-epithelialized lung using H&E staining showing removal of pseudostratified and squamous epithelium in conducting airways and alveoli, with retention of intact pulmonary vasculature. Pentachrome stain showed preservation of airway and alveolar basement membrane and extracellular matrix components including glycosaminoglycans (GAG), collagen and elastic fibers in de-epithelialized regions. Cell replacement by targeted delivery of airway epithelial cells (AEC) into large airways was performed using a lung matrix hydrogel carrier, and lung stem cells (LSC) into alveoli.",

IFN\u03b3 was not detected at any time point in either experimental group. In the prolonged maintenance group, markers with no significant changes over 24 h of cross-circulation were total protein, IL-6 and M30. Significant increases were measured for IL-8 and IL-10, and significant decreases were measured for IL-1\u03b2, IL-17 and TNF\u03b1 over 24 h of cross-circulation. In the ischaemic recovery group, total protein and inflammatory cytokine levels were initially higher relative to the prolonged maintenance group, with the exception of IL-17.

After 36 h of cross-circulation, a fluorescent cell viability marker (CFSE) was delivered with bronchoscopic guidance to targeted regions of the distal lung. Uptake of CFSE observed in all target regions confirmed cell viability at 36 h and demonstrated the potential for targeted delivery of therapeutics into the extracorporeal lung during cross-circulation.",
                        "The size of commercially available bronchoscopes limits their ability to access and visualize the distal lung. Because of the growing number of bronchopulmonary therapeutics and the need to measure improvements in lung function, we developed a compact transpleural imaging system that enabled non-invasive, real-time surveillance of the lung and guided delivery of microbeads and fluorescently labelled porcine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the distal lung. Labelled MSCs were widely distributed throughout targeted regions of lung and clearly seen in the alveoli and pulmonary interstitium. Post-procedural analysis of MSCs showed co-localization with integrin-\u03b21, an adhesion molecule known to mediate the migration of MSCs into the interstitium in multiple tissues.",
                        "To demonstrate the feasibility of replacing lung epithelium during cross-circulation, targeted bronchopulmonary segments were decellularized by micro-catheter delivery of 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), a reagent previously used for lung decellularization. Histologic comparison of intact and de-epithelialized airways confirmed the removal of epithelium in large airways and alveoli, without disruption of adjacent large arteries, microvasculature or capillaries. Pentachrome staining suggested retention of extracellular matrix proteins including collagens and glycosaminoglycans, critical structural and biochemical factors for the proper attachment and function of newly delivered cells. The absence of haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis suggests that the regional decellularization process was well tolerated, and the stability and performance of the lung was unaffected. Decellularization was followed by delivery of pulmonary epithelial cells: heterogeneous populations of small airway epithelial cells and embryonic-stem-cell-derived alveolar progenitor cells were delivered to the large airways and distal alveoli, respectively, to replace the cells removed by decellularization. Small airway epithelial cells, delivered in a hydrogel made of lung extracellular matrix, were distributed across the airway surface and attached to the denuded basement membrane, while alveolar progenitors were observed throughout the alveoli.",
                        "This first application of cross-circulation as a platform for prolonged normothermic extracorporeal organ support resulted in (1) the maintenance of viable extracorporeal lungs and stable recipients after 36 h of cross-circulation, and (2) the recovery of lungs subjected to ischaemia reperfusion injury.",
                        "The cross-circulation platform provided important benefits to the extracorporeal lung, and significantly extended the duration of normothermic support beyond what is currently achievable with EVLP. Recently published reports of prolonged preservation times include periods of cold ischaemia, and normothermic perfusion remains limited to a mean of 5.00\u00b10.93 h, with a mean total preservation time of 14.60\u00b11.82 h. In the present study, we demonstrate that normothermic perfusion (EVLP +cross-circulation) can be extended to 37.67\u00b11.21 h, with total preservation time (cold ischaemia+normothermic perfusion) extending to 56.24\u00b10.11 h. Although cross-circulation support was terminated at 36 h to adhere to prescribed animal protocols, we postulate that cross-circulation could be extended to days or even weeks, an assumption currently being tested. Prolonging the duration further would allow for advanced therapeutic interventions not currently feasible; for example, gene/stem cell therapy, targeted cell removal/replacement, airway microbiome manipulation, bacterofection and donor-recipient immune modulation. Cross-circulation could serve as a platform for the recovery of organs that are unacceptable for transplantation, and could enable the assessment of graft function and modulation of the recipient response. This capability would allow for early recognition of primary graft dysfunction and for interventions prior to transplantation. Because this platform allows for continuous organ and recipient monitoring, it is well suited for studies of lung physiology, immunology and xenotransplantation.",
                        "Establishment of cross-circulation required the development of strategies to address challenges unique to prolonged extracorporeal organ support. Pulmonary venous drainage was managed using an endothelialized (that is, non-thrombogenic) bio-bridge between the pulmonary veins and the extracorporeal circuit, offering several key features as an alternative to artificial cuffs and gravity collection systems. Pressure-limited flow allowed tight maintenance of a physiologic trans-pulmonary pressure gradient of between 5 and 15 mmHg throughout the duration of extracorporeal support, while height differences allowed for modulation of PV pressures via hydrostatic pressure differentials.",
                        "In this study, the prolonged maintenance group consisted of healthy lungs that (1) served as proof that cross-circulation could support lungs outside the body at normothermia while preserving cell viability and global function for 36 h and (2) established recipient safety. In addition, lungs in the prolonged maintenance group served as healthy controls providing baseline values and trends over time for uninjured lungs on cross-circulation. To assess the ability of cross-circulation to recover damaged lungs in a clinically relevant injury model, lungs were subjected to ischaemia reperfusion injury followed by 36 h of cross-circulation (ischaemic recovery group). Lungs in the ischaemic recovery group were subjected to 18 h of static cold ischaemia, a period that is two to three times longer than what is accepted by most centers. Histologic evidence of cell and tissue derangement as a result of cold ischaemia was observed in separate injury validation studies and confirmed in blinded pathologic assessment of injured lungs.",
                        "Inflammation was assessed by analysis of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and BAL fluid. For markers of inflammation, lung pathologic scoring, lung metabolism and macrophage quantification, our analyses included time points up to 24 h to assess the effects of cross-circulation alone before any intervention in the extracorporeal lung (for example, decellularization and cell replacement). Preservation of lung integrity and function was demonstrated in the prolonged maintenance group throughout the entire duration of cross-circulation. For recipient serum markers, there were no significant differences over 24 h of cross-circulation, underscoring the maintenance of homeostatic stability. Notably, BAL fluid analysis in the extracorporeal lung demonstrated a significant increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 and significant decreases in pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17. TNF\u03b1 did not decrease significantly until after 12 h of cross-circulation, highlighting the value of prolonged recovery time. Although IL-8 increased, endpoint concentrations were 6-400 times lower than previously reported values.",
                        "In the ischaemic recovery group, lung weight and airway oedema were significantly reduced after 4-6 h of cross-circulation support (results that would be expected with an equivalent duration of EVLP. However, a downward trend in several indicators of lung quality and function, such as dynamic compliance, P/F ratio and ZO-1, continued to decline in the first 12 h of cross-circulation before recovering to baseline values by 24 to 36 h; thus highlighting the developmental nature of reperfusion injury and the importance of prolonged support time to enable recovery. Reperfusion injury is partly initiated by activated macrophages known to play a role in surfactant degradation and in the rapid release of cytokines, most notably TNF\u03b1. In the ischaemic recovery group, alveolar macrophages were highest at 12 h, corresponding to a decrease in lung compliance and a significant increase in BAL levels of TNF\u03b1 at the same time. By 24 h macrophages and TNF\u03b1 levels were significantly decreased, and compliance improved.",
                        "Neutrophils perpetuate the late phase of reperfusion injury (after 4 h of reperfusion) by increasing oxidative stress. In the ischaemic recovery group, the increased presence of marginated neutrophils between 0 and12 h, and the subsequent decrease between 24 and 36 h, was confirmed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and blinded pathologic assessment, quantified by neutrophil elastase immunostaining, and assessed via myeloperoxidase activity. Furthermore, decreased ventilatory function, blinded pathologic assessment, analysis by transmission electron microscopy and reduced ZO-1 immunostaining all indicated that cellular derangement occurred throughout the first 12 h.",
                        "Beyond 12 h of cross-circulation, injured lungs recovered cellular and structural integrity and showed significant improvements at the cell and tissue level as well as in global function. Comprehensive analyses of recovered lungs revealed the following: gross appearance, radiography and thermography consistent with healthy lungs; absence of airway secretions, and interstitial and alveolar oedema; restoration of barrier function with intact alveolar epithelium and epithelial and vascular tight junctions; recovery of cellular and structural integrity that was histologically consistent with healthy lungs; maintenance of airway structures including cartilage, smooth muscle and submucosal glands; and viability and function of the mucociliary escalator, pulmonary epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. Taken together, these data underlie a global lung function that resulted in P/F ratios >800 mmHg (values similar to those in healthy lungs) after 56 h outside the body.",
                        "Beyond prolonged normothermic extracorporeal support, cross-circulation may also enable interventions not currently feasible ex vivo. Targeted micro-volume delivery techniques and the development of a radiation-free, real-time transpleural imaging systems enabled directed region-specific interventions rather than whole lung decellularization or treatment strategies. We demonstrated global, single-lobe and subsegmental delivery and engraftment of MSCs in both single-cell and aggregate suspensions. Given the large number of clinical trials of MSC therapy, cross-circulation may offer opportunities to improve delivery techniques and further investigate the engraftment and function of therapeutic stem cells over time.",
                        "While the use of inbred swine reduced immunological interactions enabled this initial proof-of-concept study, future work will investigate prolonged cross-circulation between unrelated donor and recipient swine kept on immunosuppression. This study investigated lungs subjected to ischaemia reperfusion injury, ongoing studies are assessing the ability of cross-circulation to rescue severely damaged lungs in a gastric aspiration model. Swine recipients were healthy at baseline. We envision that patients with end-stage lung disease on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support awaiting lung transplantation may be candidates for clinical applications of cross-circulation. Initial candidates will probably be those with isolated lung disease (for example, interstitial lung disease) capable of handling the additional metabolic demand of an extracorporeal lung (-5% of total body metabolism). Before the implementation of cross-circulation, ethical considerations such as patient safety, informed consent, training and credentialing of providers, and outcome analysis would need to be addressed in a manner that is consistent with medical standards. While flow in the extracorporeal lung was maintained at 5-10% of cardiac output, future studies should include ramp-up strategies to reach 40% of cardiac output. Lungs maintained and recovered by cross-circulation were not transplanted. Future studies will investigate the effect of extended cross-circulation support on early and late outcomes following lung transplantation.",
                        "An intervention of increasing interest is cell replacement, whereby damaged or diseased cells are removed and replaced with healthy cell progenitors or differentiated cells. We demonstrated removal and replacement of the pulmonary epithelium in a targeted region-specific manner while maintaining the overall function and integrity of the lung. To better control cell delivery into proximal airways, a hydrogel prepared from lung extracellular matrix was used as a natural carrier of airway cells. Our novel transpleural imaging system enabled real-time visualization of cells during delivery and confirmed distribution, localization, and enabled monitoring over time without tissue sampling. Notably, this device has the potential to facilitate basic research and translational applications and to direct clinical interventions as a theranostic for image-guided delivery of therapeutic agents to distal regions of the lung not accessible by conventional bronchoscopy.",
                        "Patient-derived cell therapies offer exciting opportunities for the engineering of chimeric organs and may ultimately reduce the burden of immunosuppressive therapy and the incidence of chronic rejection.
