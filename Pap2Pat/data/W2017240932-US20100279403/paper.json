    "title": "Derivation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Human Peripheral Blood T Lymphocytes",
    "date": "2010-06-29",
    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold enormous potential for the development of personalized in vitro disease models, genomic health analyses, and autologous cell therapy. Here we describe the generation of T lymphocyte-derived iPSCs from small, clinically advantageous volumes of non-mobilized peripheral blood. These T-cell derived iPSCs (\u201cTiPS\u201d) retain a normal karyotype and genetic identity to the donor. They share common characteristics with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with respect to morphology, pluripotency-associated marker expression and capacity to generate neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Additionally, they retain their characteristic T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, a property which could be exploited for iPSC clone tracking and T-cell development studies. Reprogramming T-cells procured in a minimally invasive manner can be used to characterize and expand donor specific iPSCs, and control their differentiation into specific lineages.",

                "In vitro reprogramming of somatic cells to an undifferentiated pluripotent state by viral transfer of defined factors such as SOX2, OCT4, NANOG and LIN28 or SOX2, OCT4, c-Myc, and KLF4 [1], [2] has opened the way for the generation of patient-specific human iPSCs using multiple cell types [3], [4]. This premise has been further advanced by derivation of iPSCs via transient expression of genes or by using protein transduction of appropriate transcription factors [5], [6]. To date, the majority of iPSC research in humans has focused on fibroblasts as a cell source. While fibroblasts offer certain advantages as a starting material due to their commercial availability and ease of gene delivery, they are suboptimal for large-scale clinical derivation of iPSC lines due to the need for invasive skin biopsies and the difficulty of establishing stable lines from primary tissue. Non-mobilized peripheral blood is perhaps the ideal cell source for reprogramming due to the ease of obtaining patient samples [7]. Additionally, large numbers of frozen blood samples, from living and deceased donors, are stored in biorepositories worldwide [8].",
                "Investigators have recently reported successful reprogramming of primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from both mobilized and non-mobilized blood donors [3], [9]. These findings represent an important advance in iPSC research, however, non-mobilized adult peripheral blood contains approximately 100\u20131000 CD34+ cells/ml [10], [11] making these rare progenitors a challenging cell source for iPSC line derivation from small blood volumes. As an alternative, more abundant and tractable blood cell source we report the derivation of iPSCs from T lymphocytes obtained from the equivalent of 1 ml whole blood. These T-cell derived iPSCs (\u201cTiPS\u201d) share essential characteristics with hESCs as well as fibroblast-derived iPSC lines. Additionally, they retain their characteristic T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, a property which could be exploited, for example, as a genetic tracking marker or in re-differentiation experiments to study human T-cell development."

            "paragraphs": [
                "T-cells are well suited as a starting material for reprogramming due to their abundance in whole blood (\u223c6.5\u00d7105\u20133.1\u00d7106/ml in healthy adults) [12] and ease of culture using well-established protocols [13], [14]. To facilitate T-cell proliferation and efficient retroviral transduction, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a leukapheresis or a standard venipuncture (Vacutainer\u00a9 CPT tube) and cultured in serum-free media with IL-2 and anti-CD3 antibody (Figure 1). This led to preferential expansion of mature CD3+ T-cells consisting of an average day 3 CD3+ purity of 90% +/\u2212 7% (Figure 2A).",
                "Activated T-cell enriched populations containing 1\u00d7106 cells were subjected to two rounds (at day 0 and 1) of retroviral transduction with four separate vectors, each encoding one of the reprogramming factors (SOX2, OCT4, c-Myc, or KLF4) linked to a fluorescent marker gene. Transduction efficiency was assessed at day 3 by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Staining for CD3 showed the transduced population to be 99% +/\u2212 1% CD3+ (Figure 2A).",
                "The population of cells containing the transduced T-cells was placed on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in hESC medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). iPSC colonies were observed beginning at day 23. Reprogramming efficiencies of T-cells were estimated by dividing the number of colonies with hESC-like morphology by the input number of transduced cells and determined to be approximately 0.01%, similar to published fibroblast and CD34+ cell efficiencies [1], [3].",
                "TiPS were generated from both leukapheresis samples (from a male Hispanic adult, lines denoted \u201cTiPS-L\u201d) and whole blood Vacutainer samples (from a male Caucasian adult, lines denoted \u201cTiPS-V\u201d). In each case, reprogramming was achieved using an input cell number equivalent to the amount of T-cells in 1 ml whole blood. Colonies displaying hESC morphology were expanded on MEFs and the clones were successfully maintained under feeder-free conditions using mTeSR media and Matrigel coated plates.",
                "We performed DNA fingerprinting to verify that TiPS shared a genetic background with the starting donor T-cell population and to rule out cell line cross-contamination (Figure S1). Pluripotency was verified by expression of hESC pluripotency markers SSEA-3, SSEA-4, Tra-1-81, and OCT4 using flow cytometry (Figure 2B) and alkaline phosphatase staining (Figure S2). We confirmed the TiPS lines' T-cell origin via multiplex PCR detection of TCR \u03b2 chain rearrangements (Figure 2C).",
                "RT-PCR was performed to confirm expression of hESC genetic markers DNMT38, LEFT8, NODAL, REX1, ESG1, TERT, GDF3, and UTF1 (Figure 3A). Further characterization demonstrated integration of the transgenes into the host genome as well as their silencing following successful reprogramming (Figures 3B, C). TiPS were similar to both the hESC line H1 and to fibroblast-derived iPSC line controls in all of the above assays. Additionally, lines were karyotypically normal after multiple passages and have been propagated for over 30 passages in culture while retaining a normal karyotype (Figure S3).",
                "Finally, the TiPS cell lines were evaluated to determine their in vivo and in vitro differentiation potential. All TiPS clones formed teratomas. The teratomas contained tissue consistent with derivation from all three primary germ layers (Figures 4A). The cell lines were also assessed for their capability to differentiate in vitro into ectodermal and mesodermal lineages in various directed differentiation protocols. The clones were able to generate neurons, beating cardiac troponin T-positive cardiomyocytes and multipotent granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte (GEMM) hematopoietic cells (Figures 4B, C, D, E).",
                "A potential concern of T-cell derived iPSCs is the persistence of TCR gene rearrangements in the iPSC genome and their potential effect on subsequent differentiation. Though we did not observe any significant differences in differentiation potential between TiPS clones and hESC lines or fibroblast-derived iPSC lines (Figure 4D,E, additional data not shown) the effects of these genomic rearrangements on lymphoid differentiation remain to be investigated. TCR rearrangements may in fact prove advantageous in certain contexts, such as for iPSC clone tracking, as demonstrated by the detection of parent line clonal TCR \u03b2 chain rearrangements in derivative teratomas (Figure 5). Further, upon re-differentiation into T-cells TiPS cells may bypass key steps in the canonical thymic development sequence due to the mechanism of TCR allelic exclusion caused by the expression of their pre-rearranged TCR genes. This phenomenon could be explored in T-cell development studies.",
                "It should be noted that insertional mutagenesis and other potential disruptions of cellular function are possible when using a retroviral reprogramming protocol [15]. Recent advances in using episomal reprogramming methods may address these issues and efforts are in progress to reprogram T-cells via these alternative methods [5], [6]. Further, an interesting example of a potential therapeutic use for such episomally reprogrammed TiPS cells is as a source to differentiate integration-free hematopoietic stem cells bearing endogenous TCR genes specific for tumor-associated antigens [16].",
                "Previous reports of reprogramming terminally differentiated B lymphocytes in mice required the addition, or knock-down, of cellular identity-associated transcription factors and used a doxycycline-inducible expression system [17]. Recently, a description of reprogramming murine T-cells was published necessitating a p53 gene knock-out for successful iPSC generation [18]. Experiments involving manipulation of anti-proliferative pathways [19], [20], [21], [22] offer insights into the mechanisms of reprogramming and may significantly augment reprogramming efficiencies. However, none of the above mentioned manipulations appear to be a requirement for successful viral reprogramming of human T-cells. Additionally, our data, coupled with methodologies used in reprogramming adult CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells [3], [9], now afford a primary, human system to examine recent observations in the mouse system correlating differentiation stage of input cells with reprogramming efficiency [23].",
                "We describe the derivation of iPSCs from small, clinically advantageous volumes of non-mobilized human peripheral blood. T-cells represent an abundant cell source for reprogramming which can be harvested from large numbers of donors in a minimally invasive manner and cultured via well-established protocols. In the experiments we have detailed, TiPS have similar characteristics and differentiation potential as hESC lines and fibroblast-derived iPSC lines. Additionally, TiPS provide a novel model with which to explore iPSC clone tracking, T-cell development and therapeutic applications of iPSC technology."

                        "Cardiogenesis was induced via a cell aggregate method. Briefly, TiPS cells grown on MEFs were harvested with collagenase IV (Invitrogren) and cells grown on Matrigel were dissociated into single cell suspension using Sodium Citrate. The cell suspension was allowed to form aggregates in ultra-low attachment flasks in the presence of recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and/or zbFGF. Additionally, ROCK inhibitor H1152 was added to Matrigel-sourced cell suspensions. Beating aggregates were dissociated and stained for cardiac troponin T (cTnT) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, clone 1C11) on days 14 to 15."

                        "The neural differentiation of TiPS cells was performed as previously described [29]. Briefly, TiPS grown on MEFs were partially dissociated with collagenase IV and cultured in suspension as aggregates in Stemline Neural Stem Cell Expansion Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), bFGF (100 ng/ml) and epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml, Chemicon, Billerica, MA). Cultures were passaged weekly using a McIlwain tissue chopper. To induce neural differentiation, spheres were grown in neural induction medium (DMEM/F12 plus N2 supplement, Invitrogen) for one week and then plated onto poly-ornithine/laminin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated coverslips in the same neural induction medium supplemented with cAMP (1 uM, Sigma-Aldrich), ascorbic acid (200 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (both 10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for a further 3 weeks. The expression of neuronal maker beta III-tubulin was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining as previously described [30]."
