    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the magnetic properties of Si-gradient steel sheet produced by CVD (chemical vapor deposition) siliconizing process, comparing with 6.5% Si steel sheet. The Si-gradient steel sheet having silicon concentration gradient in the thickness direction, has larger hysteresis loss and smaller eddy current loss than the 6.5% Si steel sheet. In such a loss configuration, the iron loss of the Si-gradient steel sheet becomes lower than that of the 6.5% Si steel sheet at high frequencies. The experiment suggests that tensile stress is formed at the surface layer and compressive stress is formed at the inner layer in the Si gradient steel sheet. The magnetic anisotropy is induced by the internal stress and it is considered to affect the magnetization behavior of the Si-gradient steel sheet. The small eddy current loss of Si-gradient steel sheet can be explained as an effect of magnetic flux concentration on the surface layer.",

                "Si is one of the most effective elements for improving the magnetic properties of steel. Resistivity of the steel increases with Si content. The high resistivity is helpful to reduce eddy current losses caused by AC magnetization. When the Si content is further increased to 6.5%, the saturation magnetostriction falling to 0 and the permeability becomes maximal. However, when the Si content exceeds 4%, the ductility of the steel significantly decreases, making it difficult to produce a thin steel sheet by ordinary rolling process. In recent years, industrial production of 6.5%Si steel sheet became possible by CVD siliconizing process. 1,2 6.5% Si steel sheet is mainly used as core material effective for low noise transformer and reactor at audible frequency. 3 Furthermore, Si-gradient steel sheets are also being developed by CVD siliconizing process. 4,5 At high frequency, the Si-gradient steel sheet shows lower iron loss than 6.5% Si steel sheet despite the average Si content being less than 6.5%. 5 The developed steel sheet is mainly used as a core material of a high frequency reactor driven at 10 kHz or more. It was also found that the loss deterioration of the Si-gradient steel sheet under compressive stress is very small as compared with ordinary steel sheets. 6 Such feature is desirable as a core material. However, there are few reports of fundamental research on Si-gradient steel sheets, [7][8][9] and the characteristics are not yet fully clarified.",

The relationship between the magnetic properties of steel and stress has been investigated from various viewpoints [11][12][13] and it is well known that permeability deteriorates markedly under compressive stress. Under compressive stress, the magnetization vector of steel tends to be aligned with the  <100> axis away from the compression direction because it suppresses the increase in magnetoelastic energy. Due to this stress-induced magnetic anisotropy, the magnetic permeability in the compression direction decreases. Conversely, under tensile stress, the magnetization vector of the steel tends to be aligned with the <100> axis close to the tensile direction.",

This energy is smaller than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy by about two orders of magnitude, and it cannot exert influence strong enough to deflect the crystal magnetization vectors from <100> axis.

In the magnetization rotation region, the influence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is so large that the difference in magnetoelastic energy is considered to be negligible.

On the other hand, in the case of the Si-gradient steel sheet, the magnetization vectors of the inner layer stabilize toward the <100> axis close to the thickness direction, and these magnetization vectors hardly contribute to the value of B r .",

Moreover hysteresis loss is caused by irreversible domain wall displacement, so it is difficult to predict the value of k h theoretically. In this study, we assume that both samples are the same metallographic structure except Si concentration distribution. Since k h means the area of the hysteresis loop, k h increases with the coercive force. In the case of Si-gradient steel sheet, the magnetoelastic energy increases due to the Si concentration difference between the surface and the center, and as a result, H c and k h increase.

In high magnetic field, the effect of Si distribution is not observed. Simple loss relationship is observed between Si-gradient steel sheet and 6.5%Si steel sheet. On the low frequency side, 6.5%Si steel sheet shows lower iron loss, and on the high frequency side, Si-gradient steel sheet shows lower iron loss.

Since the surface layer of the Si-gradient steel sheet has higher permeability than the inner layer, the magnetic flux concentrates on the surface layer.
