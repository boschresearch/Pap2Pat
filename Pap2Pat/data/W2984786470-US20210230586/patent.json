While a diverse repertoire of chemical substrates can be used in ribosome-mediated polymerization, flexizyme (Fx)-mediated tRNA-charging and incorporation of amino acid analogues with long-carbon chains and cyclic structures into sequence based polymers using a genetic code reprogramming approach have remained inaccessible.",
                        "Here, we demonstrate preparation and in vitro site-specific incorporation of novel substrates into sequence based polymers using a wild type and an engineered ribosome. To achieve this goal, we synthesized new substrates based on 2 scaffolds (long carbon chain and cyclic amino acids) and found that most could be acylated onto tRNA under optimized reaction conditions. Of these acylated substrates, all could be incorporated into ribosomal peptides at the N-terminus with the wildtype ribosome using in vitro translation. Notably, some cyclic amino acids could be incorporated at the C-terminus using an engineered ribosome. Our work expands the range of chemical substrates and demonstrates that such substrates can be incorporated into a peptide with an engineered translation apparatus in vitro."

Hybridization can occur between fully complementary nucleic acid strands or between \u201csubstantially complementary\u201d nucleic acid strands that contain minor regions of mismatch. Conditions under which hybridization of fully complementary nucleic acid strands is strongly preferred are referred to as \u201cstringent hybridization conditions\u201d or \u201csequence-specific hybridization conditions\u201d. Stable duplexes of substantially complementary sequences can be achieved under less stringent hybridization conditions; the degree of mismatch tolerated can be controlled by suitable adjustment of the hybridization conditions. Those skilled in the art of nucleic acid technology can determine duplex stability empirically considering a number of variables including, for example, the length and base pair composition of the oligonucleotides, ionic strength, and incidence of mismatched base pairs, following the guidance provided by the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning\u2014A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Wetmur, 1991, Critical Review in Biochem. and Mol.

Such conditions include those in which synthesis of a primer extension product complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced in the presence of four different nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for extension (for example, a DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase) in an appropriate buffer and at a suitable temperature.",
                                "A primer is preferably a single-stranded DNA. The appropriate length of a primer depends on the intended use of the primer but typically ranges from about 6 to about 225 nucleotides, including intermediate ranges, such as from 15 to 35 nucleotides, from 18 to 75 nucleotides and from 25 to 150 nucleotides. Short primer molecules generally require cooler temperatures to form sufficiently stable hybrid complexes with the template. A primer need not reflect the exact sequence of the template nucleic acid, but must be sufficiently complementary to hybridize with the template. The design of suitable primers for the amplification of a given target sequence is well known in the art and described in the literature cited herein.",
                                "Primers can incorporate additional features which allow for the detection or immobilization of the primer but do not alter the basic property of the primer, that of acting as a point of initiation of DNA synthesis. For example, primers may contain an additional nucleic acid sequence at the 5\u2032 end which does not hybridize to the target nucleic acid, but which facilitates cloning or detection of the amplified product, or which enables transcription of RNA (for example, by inclusion of a promoter) or translation of protein (for example, by inclusion of a 5\u2032-UTR, such as an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) or a 3\u2032-UTR element, such as a poly(A)n sequence, where n is in the range from about 20 to about 200). The region of the primer that is sufficiently complementary to the template to hybridize is referred to herein as the hybridizing region.",
                                "As used herein, a primer is \u201cspecific,\u201d for a target sequence if, when used in an amplification reaction under sufficiently stringent conditions, the primer hybridizes primarily to the target nucleic acid. Typically, a primer is specific for a target sequence if the primer-target duplex stability is greater than the stability of a duplex formed between the primer and any other sequence found in the sample. One of skill in the art will recognize that various factors, such as salt conditions as well as base composition of the primer and the location of the mismatches, will affect the specificity of the primer, and that routine experimental confirmation of the primer specificity will be needed in many cases. Hybridization conditions can be chosen under which the primer can form stable duplexes only with a target sequence. Thus, the use of target-specific primers under suitably stringent amplification conditions enables the selective amplification of those target sequences that contain the target primer binding sites.",
                                "As used herein, a \u201cpolymerase\u201d refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides. \u201cDNA polymerase\u201d catalyzes the polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides.

For example, coupled transcription/translation of a given sequence defined biopolymer can arise in an extract containing an expression template and a polymerase capable of generating a translation template from the expression template. Coupled transcription/translation can occur using a cognate expression template and polymerase from the organism used to prepare the extract. Coupled transcription/translation can also occur using exogenously-supplied expression template and polymerase from an orthogonal host organism different from the organism used to prepare the extract.

                                "Through the development of flexizymes, ribozymes that promiscuously charge arbitrary amino acid monomers to tRNAs, traditional amino acid-tRNA assignments have been expanded to include nonstandard chemical substrate-tRNA pairs that are subsequently incorporated into ribosomal peptides in a site-directed manner. However, the majority of substrates utilized with flexizymes have so far been confined to amino and hydroxy acids, which fundamentally limits the extent of sequence-defined polymers that can be synthesized using the genetic code reprogramming approach. In the present work, we provide extensive empirical data for a wide variety of non-canonical substrates in flexizyme-catalyzed acylation reactions. Upon our results, we expand the range of such substrates into six different types such as phenylalanine analogues, benzoic acid derivatives containing electron-withdrawing or -donating groups, heteroatom rings, and aliphatic chains. From this data, we hypothesize design rules that may play an essential role in expanding the flexizyme-compatible substrates. Furthermore, using wild-type translational machinery in a cell-free protein synthesis system and the reprogrammed fMet-tRNA, we demonstrate the incorporation of 32 non-canonical substrates into ribosomal peptides. Engineered translational machinery might enable the introduction of additional chemical compounds, thereby significantly extending the scope of functionalized polymers that can be produced by the translation apparatus of the cell.",

                                "Description of the Technology",
                                "While current studies have reported more than 150 non-canonical substrates are charged into tRNA and incorporated into a peptide by the Fx approach, and multiple strategies have been devised to synthesize tRNAs charged with non-canonical amino acid, there still exist limitations and gaps in the range of substrates. Mis-acylated tRNAs can be synthesized using protected pdCpA followed by enzymatic ligation (e.g., T4 RNA ligase) with a truncated tRNA that lacks its 3\u2032-terminal CA nucleotides. However, the method is synthetically laborious and often gives poor results due to the generation of a cyclic tRNA by-product that inhibits ribosomal peptide synthesis. The ester linkage for mis-acylated tRNAs can also be obtained by use of engineered synthetase/orthogonal tRNA pairs. However, high specificity of the synthetase toward an amino acid substrate only allows charging a narrow range of substrate pool, which often requires extensive work (e.g., directed evolution) for the development of a new synthetase.",
                                "Another means to form a mis-acylated tRNA is through the use of flexizymes (Fx). Fx is an artificial ribozyme with the ability to aminoacylate an arbitrary tRNA. The Fx system has seen widespread success over the last decade in which a wide range (>150) of chemical substrates (\u03b1-amino acids, \u03b2-amino acids, \u03b3-amino acids, D-amino acids, nonstandard amino acids, N-protected (alkylated) amino acids, and hydroxy acids) have been incorporated into ribosomal peptide chain through mis-acylated tRNAs.",
                                "Here, we systematically expand the range of substrates toward a variety of non-canonical substrates (Phe analogues, benzoic acid derivatives, heteroatomic molecules, and aliphatic chain), which are still acceptable by Fx and the WT translation apparatus, and moreover demonstrate that using E. coli translational machinery through a purified reconstituted system (PURExpress) allows producing numerous functionalized peptide. For comparison to our study, previous studies mostly focus on amino acid variants as a Fx-compatible substrate. Second, hydroxy acid variants were only discovered as a possible substitute for a non-amino acid substrate. Third, no rationale has been developed on designing the Fx-compatible chemical substrate, which allows expanding the boundary of the substrate pool significantly. And finally, no computational research identifying the molecular interaction in the Fx binding pocket exists, which permits and facilitates the efficient design of the monomer for novel polymer synthesis.",
                                "Our rationale for designing the substrate for the Fx-catalyzed acylation has the potential to reduce process development and testing timelines for monomer that can provide novel functionality. Further, because we currently lack information on the molecular interaction of substrate to the binding pocket of Fx, our computational modeling result on the intermediate formed during the Fx-catalyzed acylation reaction can be leveraged as a foundational resource for chemists, biochemists, and molecular biologists as well as protein engineers to select a proper non-canonical substrate. Specifically, computational efforts would greatly benefit from our result, as it may aid the efficient mutational study within the Fx's active site.",
                                "Additionally, because the discovery of 32 non-canonical substrates on the five different subsets outlines diversity of substrates and characterizes its impact on peptide synthesis, this finding could be used to prototype other non-canonical chemical substrates. Finally, our substrate variants set could be readily applied to chemical substrate variants for the synthesis of various peptides, including precursors for therapeutic medicines and macrocyclic materials. This novel and comprehensive study have advantages for fundamental and synthetic/engineering biology.",

Although many pioneering works have expanded the genetic code to more than 150 nonstandard amino acids for protein synthesis, the covalent linkage of polymers synthesized by ribosomes has been confined to polypeptide bonds (amides) or polyester bonds. Herein, we explored new environments and monomer templates that allow production of organic sequence-defined polymers (SDPs) with a wide variety of covalent chemical bonds.

                                "Protein synthesis by ribosomes is achieved via polymerization of amino acids that are covalently linked to transfer RNAs (tRNAs) via aminoacylation (i.e., \u201ccharging\u201d). Thus, a tRNA that is aminoacylated with an amino acid is referred to as a \u201ccharged tRNA.\u201d A ribosome translates codons that are present in an mRNA via matching a corresponding anticodons present on charged tRNAs. The amino acid of a charged tRNA is thus incorporated via the ribosome into a nascent polypeptide corresponding to the translated mRNA.",
                                "In modern organisms, protein-based enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze aminoacylation of tRNA. However, ribozymes that aminoacylate tRNA by using activated amino acids have been discovered in vitro, which have been termed \u201cflexizymes.\u201d Flexizymes and their use for genetic reprogramming are known in the art.

Flexizymes can be evolved and selected in vitro to catalyze aminoacylation of tRNA with nonstandard amino acids, and tRNAs thus charged with nonstandard amino acids can be utilized to incorporate nonstandard amino acids in nascent polypeptides. Flexizyme systems thus enable reprogramming of the genetic code by reassigning the codons that are generally assigned to natural amino acids to nonstandard amino acids or other residues, and thus mRNA-directed synthesis of non-natural polypeptides can be achieved.",

While a diverse repertoire of chemical substrates can be used in ribosome-mediated polymerization, most have been limited to amino- and hydroxy-acids. Here, we set out to identify design rules for flexizyme-mediated charging of noncanonical monomers to tRNAs that would expand substrate scope for ribosome mediated polymerization. To achieve this goal, we synthesized 38 new substrates based on 4 scaffolds (phenylalanine derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives, heteroaromatic monomers, and aliphatic monomers) and found that 32 could be acylated onto tRNA using under optimized reaction conditions. Of these substrates, all could be incorporated into ribosomal peptides at the N-terminus using in vitro translation. Our work provides design rules for flexizyme catalyzed acylation and expands the range of chemical substrates for repurposing the translation apparatus.",
                                "Introduction",
                                "The translation apparatus is the cell's factory for protein synthesis, stitching together L-\u03b1-amino acid substrates into sequence-defined polymers (proteins) from a defined genetic template. With protein elongation rates of up to 20 amino acids per second and remarkable precision (fidelity of 99.99%)1-3, the Escherichia coli protein biosynthesis system (the ribosome and associated factors necessary for polymerization) possesses an incredible catalytic capability. This has long motivated efforts to understand and harness artificial versions for biotechnology. In nature, however, only limited sets of protein monomers are utilized, thereby resulting in limited sets of biopolymers (i.e., proteins). Expanding nature's repertoire of ribosomal monomers4-12 could yield new kinds of bio-based products with diverse genetically encoded chemistry. So far, the natural ribosome has been shown capable of selectively incorporating a wide range chemical substrates into an elongating polymer chain, especially in vitro where greater control and freedom of design is possible.13 These include \u03b1-1, \u03b2-15, \u03b3-16, D-17,18, N-alkylated19, 20, noncanonical amino acids21, hydroxy acids22,23, peptides24, oligomeric foldamer-peptide hybrids25, and non-amino carboxylic acids26, 27. The impact of incorporating such a broad and diverse set of monomers, especially for the site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids into peptides and proteins, has been the production of novel therapeutics, enzymes, and materials28-34.",
                                "For ribosomal monomers to be selectively incorporated into a growing chain by the ribosome, they must be covalently attached (or charged) to transfer RNAs (tRNAs), making aminoacyl-tRNA substrates. Multiple strategies have been devised to synthesize such noncanonical aminoacyl-tRNAs, or \u2018mis-acylated\u2019 tRNAs. The classical strategy is chemical aminoacylation, which requires the synthesis of a 5\u2032-phospho-2\u2032-deoxyribocytidylyriboadenosine (pdCpA) dinucleotide, ester coupling with the amino acid substrate, and enzymatic ligation (e.g., T4 RNA ligase) with a truncated tRNA35-39. Unfortunately, chemical aminoacylations are laborious and technically difficult, often giving poor results in translation due to the generation of a cyclic tRNA by-product which inhibits ribosomal peptide synthesis.40 Another strategy is to engineer protein enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which naturally charge canonical amino acids to tRNAs, by directed evolution.41-50 However, aaRSs have limited promiscuity for noncanonical chemical substrates, and are generally confined to a narrow range of amino acid analogues that resemble natural ones.",
                                "More recently, an alternative approach to produce mis-acylated tRNAs that uses an RNA enzyme known as flexizyme (Fx) was developed. This flexible and powerful approach, pioneered by Suga and colleagues, is capable of exclusively aminoacylating the 3\u2032-OH of an arbitrary tRNA51 (FIG. 8a) with activated esters.52-55 Through directed evolution and sequence optimization, three different flexizymes (eFx, dFx, and aFx)5 have been developed to recognize specific combinations of substrate:activating groups. A crystallographic study56 elucidated that an aryl group either on the substrate side chain or leaving group is crucial for substrate interaction with the catalytic binding pocket of Fx. For example, eFx acylates tRNA with cyanomethyl ester (CME)-activated acids containing aryl functionality, while dFx recognizes dinitrobenzyl ester (DNBE)-activated non-aryl acids57. For substrates that lack an aryl group or have poor solubility due to the presence of DNBE, aFx has been developed recognizing a (2-aminoethyl)amidocarboxybenzyl thioester (ABT)58 leaving group which provides the required aryl group and better aqueous solubility (FIG. 8a, bottom panel).",
                                "The unique potential of the flexizyme approach is that virtually any amino acid can be charged to any tRNA, as long as the side chain is stable toward the conditions of the acylation reaction (or suitably protected/deprotected in the case of reactive side chains), enabling the reassignment of a specific codon to an amino acid de novo. As such, the development of flexizyme has significantly expanded the known permissible space of monomers used in translation by genetic code reprogramming. The range of monomers incorporated has so far, however, mainly been limited to amino23 and hydroxy acids33. Design rules for flexizyme mediated charging, which may more effectively guide the search for noncanonical monomers, are still being identified. To expand the available design space for template guided polymerization by the ribosome to polymers beyond polypeptides or polyesters, new efforts to explore constraints that limit the scope of noncanonical monomer diversity permissible to both flexizyme mediated charging and translation by the ribosome are needed.",
                                "Here, we set out to fill this gap in knowledge by systematically expanding the range of chemical substrates for flexizyme-mediated charging followed by translation using natural ribosomes (FIG. 8). Specifically, we synthesized a repertoire of 38 phenylalanine derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives, heteroaromatic monomers, and aliphatic monomers that were designed based on known compatible scaffolds. We deliberately chose potential substrates that feature chemical moieties inaccessible to native ribosomally synthesized peptides or their post-translationally modified derivatives, or that could support novel A-B polycondensation reactions (rather than amide and ester bonds). After chemical synthesis of the activated esters, we assessed the ability of flexizyme charging of these substrates to tRNAs by varying pH and time to create optimized acylation conditions. We found that 32 of the 38 substrates are charged to tRNAs from which trends emerged that will help to more effectively guide the search for novel monomers. To gain insights into the substrate-flexizyme compatibility, we also used computational modeling for studying the molecular interaction of the nucleic acid residues in the binding pocket of flexizyme with the substrates showing high or low acylation yield. Finally, we asked if the novel tRNA-monomers could be used by the wild type ribosome in the commercially available PURExpress\u2122 cell-free translation system. While N-terminal incorporation of novel monomers into peptides from substrate-tRNAfMet complexes was possible for 32 of the substrates, incorporation into the C-terminus of peptides was not possible by wild type ribosomes.",

                                "To expand the substrate scope for Fx-catalyzed tRNA mis-acylation, we initially determined compatible substrate scaffolds. For this, we benchmarked the molecular structure of CME-activated phenylalanine (Phe-CME, A, FIG. 9a, middle panel) as the optimal substrate for eFx51, 56, 59, 61 and investigated eFx's substrate flexibility toward a series of five substrates with increasing degree of modification from the parent structure, A (B-F, FIG. 9a, middle panel). These include: B (hydrocinnamic acid): amine excluded from A; C (cinnamic acid): the unsaturated form of B; D and E (benzoic and phenylacetic acid, respectively): two or one carbon excluded from B; and F (propanoic acid): aryl replaced with aliphatic group in B.",
                                "First, we determined the acylation efficiency of A to a small tRNA mimic, microhelix tRNA (mihx, 22 nt) by eFx using the previously reported standard acylation conditions (pH 7.5, 0\u00b0 C.)62 (FIG. 9a, top panel). Analysis of the reaction mixture by denaturing acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) indicated that 67% of mihx was acylated with A (FIG. 9b, lane 1). With this benchmark established, we then screened substrate-eFx compatibility of the five substrates. eFx successfully acylated mihx with B in 77% yield, indicating that an amine functional group is not required for aminoacylation (FIG. 9b, lane 2). Moving further from the Phe structure proved difficult, as \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated substrate C was incompatible for mihx acylation via flexizyme under standard reaction conditions (FIG. 9b, lane 3). However, as we increased reaction pH and time (pH 7.5 to pH 8.8 and 16 h to 120 h, see FIGS. 13 and 14 for full details), mihx acylation with C improved yielding 44% and 74% after 16 and 120 h, respectively (FIG. 9b, lanes 6, 7). Notably, the newly established pH of 8.8 increased the yields for A and B to 82% and 100%, respectively (FIG. 9b, lanes 4, 5). Although to a minor extent, D and E were also acylated to the mihx in 16% and 40% yield, respectively (FIG. 9b, lane 8, 9). As expected, the aliphatic substrate F was not charged to the mihx by eFx, as the substrate does not contain an aryl group for substrate recognition by eFx (FIG. 9b, lane 10). However, changing the substrate's leaving group from CME to ABT and employing aFx in place of eFx enabled charging of the same aliphatic substrate G in 55% yield after 120 h (FIG. 9b, lane 11). Hence, using the newly established acylation conditions and utilizing the appropriate leaving group and Fx, all five substrates are successfully charged to the tRNA mimic.",
                                "Next, we sought to further expand the substrate scope by elaborating the scaffolds of B, C, D, and G, to teach us about permissible substrates. Not only substrates that could be used by the Fx system, but also, later, the ribosome (see below). For this, we determined the mihx-acylation efficiency of eFx and aFx with four sets of scaffold analogues: Phe analogues harboring saturated and unsaturated aliphatic scaffolds with an aryl group, benzoic acid derivatives with a variety of functional groups, heteroaromatic scaffolds with different electronic properties, as well as aliphatic scaffolds with various steric hindrances (FIG. 10).",
                                "To investigate saturated and unsaturated aliphatic scaffolds containing an aryl group, we explored Phe analogues derived to bear a variety of functionalities (1-6) from the Fx substrates B and C.",
                                "Under optimal conditions, the substrates 1-4 were charged to the mihx by eFx in yields of 50-100% after 16 h and 100% after 120 h (FIGS. 15 and 16). Substrate 5 and 6 containing \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated scaffolds showed similar yield to their parent structure C. Both were charged by eFx at lower efficiencies (30% and 22% yield, respectively) than the saturated substrates, likely due to their increased structural rigidity hindering interaction with the Fx binding pocket.",
                                "To further understand the substrate compatibility of eFx toward benzoic acid (D), we prepared a series of derivatives with altering electronic character (electron-poor: 7-14, electron-rich: 15-18) as well as substituent position (ortho, meta, para), performed Fx-catalyzed acylation reactions, and determined the acylation efficiency by acid denaturing PAGE and densiometric analysis (FIGS. 15, 17, and 18). For p-nitro-substituted substrate (7), determined acylation yield of eFx were 30% yield after 16 h and 76% after 120 h, and for unsubstituted substrate (D) 0% at 16 h, 16% at 120 h.",
                                "Similarly, high yields (28-48% at 16 h, 78-100% at 120 h) were observed for the electron-poor substrates (8-11) bearing a p-nitrile, p-azide, m-formyl group, and m-nitromethyl group, respectively. In contrast, the substrate with moderate electron-donating groups such as p-methoxy (15), p-ethynyl (16), and p-hydroxymethyl (17) showed lower reaction rate; no acylation was observed after 16 h and only with moderate yields after 120 h (19-63%). We observed no conversion after 120 h for electron-rich p-amino substrate 18. These results indicate a significant electronic effect; reaction rates generally increased for electron-poor substrates and decreased for electron-rich substrates.",
                                "We tested this hypothesis by installing an electron-withdrawing nitro-group at the meta position of the poor Fx substrate, 18, leading to substrate 21. As predicted, a slight improvement of 10% yield was observed after 120 h. Swapping the substituent pattern leading to substrate 20 (p-nitro and m-amine) further improved the reaction efficiency to 55% yield after 120 h, supporting the reactivity trend based on electronic character. In addition, we observed that ortho-substituent tolerance was governed by steric effects as o-fluoro 12 resulted in 82% yield after 120 h, while substrates with larger ortho substituents (o-iodo 13, o-formyl 14) were not charged to the mihx. The correlation between electronic character and Fx-catalyzed acylation was further confirmed by investigating the electron-poor heteroaromatic substrates pyridine 22, fluoro-pyridine 23, and coumarin 24. All three substrates were charged with high yields (45-100% at 16 h and 100% at 120 h) following the electronic trend. In contrast, five-membered electron-rich heteroaromatic substrates (pyrrole 25, 25a and thiophene 26, 26a; see FIG. 19 for 25a and 26a) did not show any reactivity in the Fx-catalyzed tRNA acylation reaction.",
                                "Finally, we investigated the substrate compatibility of aFx by exploring its catalytic activity toward aliphatic variants derived from its substrate G. We found that straight chain aliphatic acids are highly favored substrates; alkenyl (27), cyano (28) and ester (29) analogues were charged with 100% yield after 16 h. Nitroalkane (30) was a competent substrate, albeit in diminished yield (25%, 16 h and 30%, 120 h). In contrast, sterically hindered cyclohexyl (31) were charged at a slower rate (30% yield, 120 h). Moreover, bromopropane (32) was charged to only 10% after 120 h, indicating that increased steric bulk further decreases Fx-catalyzed acylation.",
                                "In summary, from the 38 tested analogues, 32 hitherto unknown Fx substrates were identified, significantly expanding the scope of the Fx-catalyzed aminoacylation reaction. Based on their molecular characteristics and efficiencies in Fx-catalyzed acylation, general design rules for potential Fx substrates are deduced with greatest success for: i) higher structural similarity to Phe for eFx, ii) electron-decreasing characteristics from the carbonyl region, and iii) less steric hindrance at the acylation site.",
                                "To gain further insights about possible constraints for using flexizyme to charge noncanonical chemical substrates onto tRNAs, we next used computational modeling to better understand our data. A previous crystallographic study56 suggests that when an aromatic amino acid such as Phe is charged by Fx, the phenyl ring of the substrate stacks against the terminal J1a/3 base pair of Fx. Notably, the structure as crystallized (PDB: 3CUL and 3CUN) contains only residual density for a phenylalanyl-ethyl ester ligand, which is suggestive of a possible location for substrate conformation at the active site. To elucidate the molecular interaction of substrates in the binding pocket of Fx, using Rosetta63, we generated models (data not shown) of the tetrahedral intermediates formed with tRNA by five representative substrates (A-E) as well as pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (25, 25a) and 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (26, 26a) that gives no acylation yield on Fx-catalysis (FIG. 11). The modeling supports either T-stacked interaction for Phe and hydrocinnamic acid (B) or parallel stacked interactions for cinnamic acid (C), benzoic acid (D), and phenylacetic acid (E). In contrast, pyrrole and thiophene groups are unable to form particularly favorable interactions with the terminal J1a/3 base pair. The absence of these interactions may explain our empirical observation that 25, 25a and 26, 26a containing an electron-rich heteroaromatic group are poor substrates for eFx.",

                                "Next, we investigated whether the newly found Fx substrates that can be charged onto tRNAs are accepted by the natural protein translation machinery. Based on our optimized conditions, we performed Fx-catalyzed acylation reactions using Fx-optimized tRNAs62 instead of the mihx. Then, we purified the tRNA-monomers and added them to a cell-free protein synthesis reaction, allowed translation to proceed, and determined the incorporation of the new substrates into a small reporter peptide by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (FIG. 12 and data not shown).",
                                "Initially, we attempted to use a well-established crude extract-based Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS)34, 64-67 which is capable of high-level incorporation of noncanonical amino acids. However, we were not able to characterize the reporter peptide, presumably because active peptidases in the extract digested the peptide. In order to circumvent possible undesired degradation, we turned to the commercially available (Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements) PURExpress\u2122 system68. The PURExpress\u2122 system contains the minimal set of components required for protein translation, thereby minimizing any undesired peptide degradation, and allows addition of custom sets of amino acids and tRNAs of interest.",
                                "Previous works from the Suga lab, among others, have shown this platform to be suitable for assessing peptide synthesis69, especially for N-terminal incorporation of noncanonical monomers25, 60. As a reporter peptide, we designed a T7 promoter-controlled DNA template (pJL1_StrepII) encoding the translation initiation codon AUG for N-terminal incorporation of the novel Fx substrates, a Streptavidin (Strep) tag and a Ser and Thr codon (XMWHSPQFEKST (SEQ ID NO:15) (strep-tag: italicized), and where X indicates the position of the novel Fx substrate, for details, see SI). Peptide synthesis was performed using only the 9 amino acids that decode the initiation codon AUG and the purification tag (data not shown). We excluded the other 11 amino acids to prevent corresponding endogenous tRNAs from being aminoacylated and used in translation, thereby, eliminated competition between endogenous tRNAs and Fx-charged tRNAs during peptide synthesis. For this, PURExpress\u2122 reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 h. The synthesized peptides were then purified using Strep-Tactin\u00ae-coated magnetic beads (IBA), denatured with SDS, and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (FIG. 12a).",
                                "As a positive control experiment, we prepared a peptide in the presence of all 20 natural amino acids and absence of any Fx-charged tRNA, so that the reporter mRNA would be translated into MWHSPQFEKST (SEQ ID NO:16) according to the standard genetic code. Indeed, we detected two major peaks corresponding to the theoretical mass of the peptide ions. The Met residue at the N-terminus was found to be formylated (fM) (fMWHSPQFEKST, SEQ ID NO:17) by a formylase present in the PURE system70; [M+H]+=1405 (observed, obs), 1405 Da (calculated, cal), [M+Na]+=1427 (obs), 1427 Da (cal) (FIG. 12b).",
                                "As a negative control experiment, we performed a PURExpress\u2122 reaction in the presence of only 9 amino acids encoding the residues downstream of the initiating codon (W, S, H, P, Q, F, E, K, and T); no Met or mis-acylated tRNAfMet was added to the reaction mixture. The MALDI spectrum shows only a single species for the synthesized peptide giving a mass of 1246 ([M+H]+) and 1268 Da ([M+Na]+) (FIG. 12c). The observed peaks correspond to the theoretical mass of a peptide with sequence WHSPQFEKST (SEQ ID NO:18), indicating that translation initiation can occur on the succeeding mRNA codon if the amino acid for the initiating codon is not present in CFPS system, a phenomenon previously reported71.",
                                "For incorporation of the noncanonical substrates (B-E, and G) at the start codon, we used the tRNAfMet containing the CAU anticodon, corresponding to the AUG codon on the mRNA and charged all five substrates onto the tRNA separately. The same amount of precipitated tRNA containing a mixture of substrate-charged/uncharged tRNA was added to the PURExpress' reaction. Methionine was not added to the reaction so as to avoid the incorporation of Met at the start codon by Met-charged endogenous tRNAfMet produced in the PURE system. We discovered that all the peaks found in the MALDI spectra corresponded to a theoretical mass of peptide that contains the substrate on the N-terminus (FIG. 12d-i). It is notable that N-terminal Trp was found to be unformylated (FIG. 12c) in comparison with that the N-terminal Met in FIG. 12b, which was found to be completely formylated. The N-terminus Phe (FIG. 12d) was found to with formylation (f) and without formylation (F), suggesting that a larger side chain may prohibit the formylase from efficiently formylating the residue.",
                                "We carried out the same acylation reaction onto a tRNAfMet for the other noncanonical substrates (B-G and 1-32, except for the 6 substrates that showed no acylation; F, 13, 14, 18, 25, and 26) and subsequently synthesized 32 different peptides with each substrate on the N-terminus, indicating all the noncanonical substrates were incorporated into a peptide. MALDI spectra were generated for the purified peptide (data not shown). The substrates with higher acylation yields tend to show higher translation efficiency (data not shown), representing the concentration of mis-acylated tRNA is a limiting factor for the translation. To more rigorously characterize the N-terminal peptides, we additionally quantified peptide yields (data not shown). These data support our hypothesis that the system is limited by mis-acylated tRNA.",
                                "Ribosome-mediated polymerization of alternative A-B polycondensation reactions (i.e., non-ester and non-amide bonds) may offer new classes of sequence-defined polymers. Using a mis-acylated tRNAGluE2(GGU) recognizing an ACC codon (Thr) on the mRNA, we tested incorporation of a few substrates at the C-terminus of a peptide, which would require formation of a covalent carbon-carbon bond. Unfortunately, our attempt to produce a biopolymer with such a bond was unsuccessful.",
                                "Conclusion",
                                "In this work, we set out to systematically expand the range of chemical substrates for translation though the identification of design rules for flexizyme-mediated charging of noncanonical monomers to tRNAs. Beyond commonly used amino- and hydroxy-acids, we showed that a diverse repertoire of substrates built from elaborating upon phenylalanine, benzoic acid, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic scaffolds could be acylated to tRNAs. Our rational approach to scaffold design allowed us to better identify design rules for using flexizymes to charge novel monomers onto tRNA. We found, as expected, that substrates that look more like phenylalanine are favorable for Fx catalyzed acylation reactions. We also found new guiding principles, for examples, that electron-poor substrates are favored over electron rich, and certain bulky groups are poorly not well tolerated near the acylation site. Additionally, by investigating the molecular interaction of key substrates in the binding pocket of flexizyme using computational modeling, we found that either T-stacked or parallel-stacked interactions seem to be key features that enable charging by flexizyme. Beyond these design rules, we also showed that tRNA-monomers from our expanded substrates successfully yield a wide variety of N-functionalized peptides in a PURExpress\u2122 system through genetic code reprogramming. This is important because our data joins an emerging number of studies showing that the ribosome is capable of polymerizing a wide array of substrates, especially at the N-terminus. While the production of novel N-terminal peptides themselves was not our focus, they might be used directly by others in the field in multiple ways. For example, the peptides containing 4 and 27 at the N-terminus have the potential to combine the advantages of synthetic polymers and sequence-defined peptides by chemically attaching a molecule with a polymerizable unit, which could lead to novel hybrid materials. Looking forward, we anticipate that our work will enable the design and selection of new classes of noncanonical monomers for use in translation. For example, the monomers we describe also begin the march towards novel classes of sequenced defined polymers that are not polyesters or polyamides, perhaps even those with carbon-carbon bonds. However, since the shape, physiochemical, and dynamic properties of the ribosome and its active site have been evolutionarily optimized to operate with proteins built of \u02dc20 canonical amino acids, such advances will need to be supported by additional efforts in engineering the translation apparatus72,73.",
