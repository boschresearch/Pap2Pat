    "abstract": "A targeting method is described that allows precise cassette replacement at a previously characterized genetic locus. A target DNA construct containing a pair of incompatible FRT sites flanking a target cassette was introduced into soybean by regular biolistic transformation. Transgenic events containing a single complete copy of the target site were then selected and retransformed with a donor DNA construct containing the identical pair of incompatible FRT sites flanking a donor cassette. Precise DNA cassette exchange happened between the target cassette and the donor cassette via recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) so that the donor cassette was introduced at the exact genomic site previously occupied by the target cassette. Through repeated RMCE using additional incompatible FRT sites, multiple groups of transgenes can be stacked at the same genomic locus.",

                        "Current transformation methods using Agrobacterium or biolistic bombardment have challenges such as random integration, multiple transgene copies, and unpredicted integration sites. Acting alone or combined, these challenges could lead to unpredictable expression or silencing of introduced transgenes. Though homologous recombination can be explored to address these challenges (lida and Terada, (2005) Plant Mol. Biol. 59:205-219; Wright et al. (2005) Plant J. 44:693-705), site-specific integration (SSI) mediated by DNA recombinase is practically a more promising approach to eliminate random integration of unpredictable copies of a transgene by placing single copy transgene into a pre-characterized site in plant genome.",
                        "Several site-specific DNA recombination systems, such as the Cre/lox of bacteriophage P1, the FLP/FRT of Sacchromyces cerevisiae, and the R/RS of Zygosacchromyces rouxii have been used in site-specific gene integration studies (Groth and Calos, (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 335:667-678; Ow, (2003) Plant Mol. Biol. 48:183-200). A common feature of these systems is that each system consists of a single polypeptide recombinase Cre, FLP, or R, and two identical or almost identical palindromic recognition sites lox, FRT, or RS. Each recognition site contains a short asymmetric spacer sequence where DNA strand exchange takes place, flanked on each side by an inverted repeat sequence where the corresponding recombinase specifically binds. If two recognitions sites are located in cis on the same DNA molecule, DNA segment flanked by the two sites can be excised if the two sites are in the same orientation, or be inverted if the two sites are in opposite orientations. If two recognitions sites are each located in trans on two different DNA molecules, a reciprocal translocation can happen between the two linear DNA molecules, or the two molecules can integrate if at least one of them is a circular DNA (Groth and Calos, J. Mol. Biol. 335:667-678 (2003); Ow, Plant Mol. Biol. 48:183-200 (2003)).",
                        "A simple SSI can target DNA into single recombination site previously placed in a plant genome. Improvement of the single site integration approach involved transient Cre expression and the use of mutant lox sites to recreate two less compatible lox sites after integration to reduce subsequent excision of the integrated gene in tobacco (Albert et al. (1995) Plant J. 7:649-659; Day et al. (2000) Genes Dev. 14:2869-2880). Similar approach was used to produce SSI events in rice by biolistic bombardment transformation method and the transgene was proven to be stable and consistently expressed over generations (Srivastava and Ow, (2001) Mol. Breed. 8:345-350; Srivastava et al. (2004) Plant Biotechnol. J. 2:169-179). Using Agrobacterium T-DNA for donor DNA delivery and a promoter trap to activate selectable marker gene and to displace Cre expression upon DNA recombination, \u02dc2% single lox site SSI was achieved in Arabidopsis (Vergunst et al. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26:2729-2734). The process of SSI is basically irreversible and thus the genomic site can not be recovered for repeated use. Additionally, since SSI will integrate the entire circular DNA, unwanted components such as the vector backbone is also integrated unless the integration DNA can be circulated by Cre recombinase to remove unwanted DNA prior to SSI (Srivastava et al. (2004) Plant Biotechnol J. 2:169-179; Chawla et al. (2006) Plant Biotechnol. J. 4:209-218; Vergunst et al. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26:2729-2734). To achieve marker-free site-specific gene integration, a two-step approach was proposed to combine gene integration using one recombinase system such as Cre/lox followed by gene excision using another system such as FLP/FRT that is also conditionally controlled by an inducible promoter (Srivastava and Ow, (2004) Trends Biotech. 22:627-629).",
                        "If two incompatible recognition sites, which are similar enough to be recognized by the same recombinase but also different enough to prevent DNA recombination from happening between them, are located on a linear DNA molecule, DNA segment between the two sites will not be either excised or inverted. When a circular DNA molecule carrying an identical pair of the incompatible sites is introduced, the circular DNA can integrate by the corresponding recombinase at either site on the linear DNA to create a collinear DNA molecule with four recognition sites, two from the original linear DNA and two from the circular DNA. DNA excision can subsequently happen between any pair of compatible sites and result in the restoration of the original two DNA molecules or the exchange of the intervening DNA segments between the two DNA molecules. The latter process termed recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) can be employed to integrate transgenes directionally into predefined genome sites (Baer and Bode, (2001) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 12:473-480; Trinh and Morrision, (2000) J. Immunol. Methods 244:185-193).",
                        "RMCE using two identical but oppositely orientated RS sites resulted in donor cassette exchange into the previously placed target site in tobacco (Nanto et al. (2005) Plant Biotechnol. J. 3:203-214). The donor vector containing the R recombinase gene and a third RS site to help eliminating random integration was delivered by Agrobacterium transformation. RMCE utilizing both the Cre/lox and FLP/FRT systems was used in animal cell cultures to improve RMCE frequency (Lauth et al. (2002) Nucleic Acids Res. 30:e115). RMCE using two directional incompatible FRT sites was used in Drosophila to achieve cassette exchange by transiently expressed FLP recombinase between a target DNA previously placed in the genome and a donor introduced as a circular DNA (Horn and Handler, (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102:12483-12488). A complex gene conversion approach involving Cre/lox and FLP/FRT mediated site-specific integration, RMCE, and homologous recombination was explored in maize (Djukanovic et al. (2006) Plant Biotechnol. J. 4:345-357)."

Cells can be transformed with an appropriate gene, such that expression of that transgene confers resistance to the corresponding selection agent, via de-toxification or another mechanism, so that these cells continue to grow and are subsequently able to regenerate plants. The gene conferring resistance to the selection agent is termed the \u201cselectable marker gene\u201d, \u201cselectable marker\u201d or \u201cresistance gene\u201d. Transgenic cells that lack a functional selectable marker gene will be killed by the selection agent. Selectable marker genes include genes conferring resistance to herbicidal compounds. Herbicide resistance genes generally code for a modified target protein insensitive to the herbicide or for an enzyme that degrades or detoxifies the herbicide in the plant before it can act (DeBlock et al.

Resistance to glufosinate ammonium, bromoxynil and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) has been obtained by using bacterial genes encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, a nitrilase, or a 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate monooxygenase, respectively, which detoxify the respective herbicide. \u201cSulfonylurea herbicides\u201d include but are not limited to chlorsulfuron, rimsulfuron, nicosulfuron, Classic\u00ae, and Oust\u00ae.

It is appreciated by one skilled in the art that a selection agent may not be toxic to all plant species or to all cell types within a given plant. For a plant species susceptible to a given selection agent, it is also appreciated that resistance cells, tissues or whole plants may be obtained independent of the transformation process, e.g., through chemical mutagenesis of the target gene or gene amplification of the target gene during tissue culture.",

The RMCE approach employs a transgenic plant which comprises a first sequence encoding a first recombination site and a second sequence comprising a second non-identical recombination site. A transfer cassette is then introduced into the transgenic plant, wherein the transfer cassette comprises the same first sequence encoding the same first recombination site and the same second sequence comprising the same second non-identical recombination site. Recombination is then accomplished by a recombinase that recognizes and implements recombination at the non-identical recombination sites. An advantage of the directional RMCE is that DNA cassette exchange is reversible so the RMCE product can be used as new target for next round RMCE using additional recombination sites to successively stack multiple transgenes at the same locus to generate allelic transgenes. Furthermore, since RMCE places only one copy of a transgene at a selected locus, only one transgenic event is needed for each locus. The cost associated with the production, maintenance, and characterization of large numbers of transgenic events with the transgene at unpredicted multiple loci can be eliminated.",

Homozygous target lines were obtained and retransformed with a donor DNA containing a chlorsulfuron selection gene flanked by the same pair of FRT sites. A FLP expression DNA construct was co-bombarded with the donor DNA to transiently provide FLP recombinase required for DNA recombination between the target and donor DNA molecules. RMCE events were produced from multiple target lines and confirmed at both somatic embryo and plant stages by extensive molecular characterizations.",

By engineering more FRT sites in specific arrangements in target or donor constructs, multiple genes can be stacked reversibly at the same genetic locus by repeated RMCE.

                                "The target QC288A and donor QC329 constructs were designed each containing a FRT1 site (solid triangle) and a FRT87 site (open triangle) in the same orientation (FIG. 1A, FIG. 2A, FIG. 1B, FIG. 2B). FRT1 is the wild-type recombination site for FLP recombinase and FRT87 is a modified recombination site (PCT Publication No. WO2007011733 published on Jan. 25, 2007). The circular QC329 DNA could integrate into the linear QC288A DNA previously placed in soybean genome by FLP recombinase mediated DNA recombination at either the FRT1 site or the FRT87 site to form collinear intermediates that contained two FRT1 sites and two FRT87 sites. FLP recombinase mediated excision could occur to excise the intervening fragment either between the two FRT1 sites or between the FRT87 sites. The net result of the integration via recombination between one identical pair of FRT sites and subsequent excision via recombination between the other pair of FRT sites would be the replacement the target DNA with the recombined RMCE DNA QC288A329 (FIG. 1C, FIG. 3A). If the gene excision step failed to occur, the intermediates would remain as SSI events containing all the components of both the target and donor constructs (FIG. 3B, FIG. 3C).",
                                "The target construct QC288A contained a selectable marker gene hpt driven by a constitutive promoter scp1 and transgenic events were selected with hygromycin. The donor construct QC329 contained a promoter-less selectable marker gene als that would not be expressed unless a promoter was placed in front of it. During retransformation the promoter-less als gene of QC329 could be brought downstream of the scp1 promoter by RMCE and the resulted QC288A329 DNA would enable retransformation events to be selected with chlorsulfuron due to the als gene activation. SSI events with QC329 integrated at the FRT1 site would also be similarly selected. However, random integration events of QC329 would not be able to survive chlorsulfuron selection unless the promoter-less als gene happened to insert downstream of a native promoter. A yellow fluorescent reporter gene cassette ubiq10:yfp was included in QC288A and a cyan fluorescent reporter gene cassette ubq:cfp was included in QC329 to facilitate transgenic events characterization (FIG. 1A, FIG. 1B, FIG. 2A, FIG. 2B).",

Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes such as DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and DNA ligase were used according to manufacturers' recommendations (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass., USA; Promega, Madison, Wis., USA; or Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). The FRT87 recombination site DNA fragment was released from construct PHP20234 with BamHI/SmaI digestion and cloned into BamHI/PvuII sites of pZSL141 to make QC278 consisted of als-FRT87. The FRT1 recombination site was made by annealing two 92 by complementary oligos SEQ ID NO:6 and 7 engineered with multiple cloning sites (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, Tex., USA). The BamHI/HpaI FRT1 DNA fragment was cloned into the BamHI/SmaI sites of construct pZSL90 to make QC280 consisted of scp1-FRT1:yfp:nos. The DNA fragment containing hpt coding sequence and nos terminator was release from pZSL93 with SpeI/XmaI digestion and cloned into the SpeI/XmaI sites of QC280 to make QC282 consisted of scp1-FRT1:hpt:nos+yfp:nos. The scp1-FRT1:hpt:nos+yfp:nos fragment was released from QC282 with Hind III/EcoRV digestion and cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of QC278 (the BamHI site was completely filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase) to make QC284 consisted of scp1-FRT1:hpt:nos+yfp:nos-FRT87. The ubiq10 promoter fragment was released from construct QC257i with BamHI/XmaI digestion and cloned into the BamHI/XmaI sites of QC282 to make QC286 consisted of scp1-FRT1:hpt:nos+ubiq10:yfp:nos. The final target construct QC288 consisted of scp1-FRT1:hpt:nos+ubiq10:yfp:nos-FRT87 was made by cloning BamHI/SphI fragment from QC286 into the BamHI/SphI sites of QC284 (FIG. 2A).",

The FRT87 site was added by cloning the AflII SpeI fragment of the above QC284 (the SpeI site was completely filled with Klenow DNA polymerase) into the AflII/EcoRI sites of QC281 (the EcoRI site was completely filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase) to make QC283 consisted of FRT1:cfp:nos-FRT87. The ubiq10 promoter fragment was released from QC257i with BamHI/XmaI digestion and cloned into the BamHI/XmaI sites of QC283 to make QC285 consisted of FRT1-ubiq10:cfp:nos-FRT87. Separately, the als:pinII fragment was released from QC257i with BglII/KpnI digestion (the BglII site was completely filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase) and cloned into the EcoCRI/KpnI sites of pZSL81 to make QC279 consisted of als:pinII. The SpeI/XmaI fragment of QC279 was then cloned into the SpeI/Xmal sites of QC285 to make QC287 consisted of FRT1-als:pinII+ubiq10:cfp:nos-FRT87.

Globular stage somatic embryos, which produced secondary embryos, were then excised and placed into flasks containing liquid MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D (10 mg/ml) and cultured in the light on a rotary shaker. After repeated selection for clusters of somatic embryos that multiplied as early, globular staged embryos, the soybean embryogenic suspension cultures were maintained in 35 ml liquid media on a rotary shaker, 150 rpm, at 26\u00b0 C. with fluorescent lights on a 16:8 hour day/night schedule.

This selective media was refreshed weekly. Seven to eight weeks post bombardment, green, transformed tissue was observed growing from untransformed, necrotic embryogenic clusters. Isolated green tissue was removed and inoculated into individual flasks to generate new, clonally propagated, transformed embryogenic suspension cultures. Each clonally propagated culture was treated as an independent transformation event and subcultured in the same liquid MS media supplemented with 2,4-D (10 mg/ml) and 30 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin selection agent to increase mass.

Endogenous controls were used to normalize different samples and a calibrator containing single copy of the transgene component was included for calculating the relative transgene copy numbers of the samples by comparing their relative quantifications to that of the calibrator. Since the relative quantification values contained fractions, copy numbers were considered to be 0, 1, or 2 for values of <0.3, 0.4-1.4, or 1.5-2.4, respectively.

RMCE would only occur in cells containing all three DNA QC288A, QC329, and QC292 and would bring the promoter-less als coding region of QC329 downstream of the scp1 promoter of QC288A previously placed in soybean genome for expression and thus chlorsulfuron resistance.",

An unrelated construct QC165 was used as a positive control for RMCE DNA QC288A329 since they both contain the same scp1:als cassette (FIG. 1C, FIG. 1E).

Five events M-1, A-1, B-1, B-2, and N-1 were positive and two events M-2 and M-3 were negative (FIG. 4A). The results suggested that the two negative events no longer contained the hpt component of QC288A. Event B-1 produced a much weaker QC288A-specific PCR band suggesting that it contained less QC288A DNA than other positive events. QC288A329-specific PCR was done using primers SEQ ID NO:11 and SEQ ID NO:27 to give a 497 by band. The same primers would give a 426 by band to the RMCE positive control construct QC165 (FIG. 1E). The same two events M-2 and M-3, while negative for QC288A, were positive for QC288A329 suggesting that they were complete RMCE events. The weak QC288A positive event B-1 was also positive for QC288A329, suggesting that this event was a chimeric RMCE event that still contained some original target cells. The other four QC288A positive events M-1, A-1, B-2, and N-1 were negative for QC288A329, suggesting that they were the original target events that had escaped the chlorsulfuron selection as false retransformation events.

RMCE could only occur in cells containing all three DNAs, QC288A, QC329, and QC292, and would bring the promoter-less als coding region of QC329 downstream of the scp1 promoter of QC288A previously placed in soybean genome through DNA recombination for expression and thus chlorsulfuron resistance.",
                                "Putative retransformation events were selected by chlorsulfuron resistance and checked for reporter gene cfp expression under a fluorescent microscope. CFP positive events were sampled at somatic embryo stage and screened by a common PCR with primers 35S-277F (SEQ ID NO:11) and Als-3 (SEQ ID NO:27) to amplify a RMCE-specific 497 by band to check for DNA recombination around the FRT1 site. Then the events were analyzed by construct-specific qPCR to confirm DNA recombination at FRT1 site and to check for the presence of target, donor, and Flp DNA. RMCE, target, and donor-specific qPCR assays were designed around the FRT1 recombination site in each DNA construct. RMCE-specific qPCR employed 288A-1F (SEQ ID NO:71), Als-163R (SEQ ID NO:72) primers and FAM-labeled BHQ1 probe Als-110T (SEQ ID NO:73). Target-specific qPCR employed 288A-1F (SEQ ID NO:71), Hygro-116R (SEQ ID NO:74) primers and FAM-labeled BHQ1 probe Hygro-79T (SEQ ID NO:75). Donor-specific qPCR employed 329-1F (SEQ ID NO:76), Als-163R (SEQ ID NO:72) primers and FAM-labeled BHQ1 probe Als-110T (SEQ ID NO:73). Another qPCR assay specific to the Flp construct QC292 employed Ucp3-57F (SEQ ID NO:77), Flp-A (SEQ ID NO:78) primers and FAM-labeled BHQ1 probe OMEGA5UTR-87T (SEQ ID NO:79).",

The RMCE 5\u2032 border-specific PCR employed the common antisense primer Als3 (SEQ ID NO:27) and a target line 5\u2032 border sequence-specific sense primer, 53-151 (SEQ ID NO:80) for target line A, 70-1S (SEQ ID NO:81) for target line B, and 8H-ScaS1 (SEQ ID NO:82) for target line C. The RMCE 3\u2032 border-specific PCR employed the common sense primer Cyan-1 (SEQ ID NO:83) and a target line 3\u2032 border sequence-specific antisense primer, 53-1A (SEQ ID NO:84) for target line A, 70-1A (SEQ ID NO:85) for target line B, and 8H-VecA (SEQ ID NO:86) for target line C. The target 5\u2032 border-specific PCR employed the same target line 5\u2032 border sequence-specific sense primers but a target cassette-specific common antisense primer Hygro-A (SEQ ID NO:24). The target 3\u2032 border-specific PCR employed the same target line 3\u2032 border sequence-specific antisense primers but a target cassette-specific common sense primer Yfp-3 (SEQ ID NO:25). The full length PCR employed the same target line 5\u2032 border sequence-specific sense primer and the same target line 3\u2032 border sequence-specific antisense primer for each of the three target lines to simultaneously amplify a small excision band, the full target transgene band, and the full RMCE transgene band.

For example, event A1 was positive for CFP expression and positive for DNA recombination at FRT1 site as determined by the common PCR. For construct-specific qPCR analyses, event A1 was positive for RMCE, contained one copy of donor DNA, and was free of either target or Flp DNA. For border-specific PCR analyses, event A1 was positive for both the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end assays specific to RMCE, and negative for both the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end assays specific to the target. Full length PCR from the 5\u2032 end border to the 3\u2032 end border amplified a small band specific to excision and failed to amplify any band specific to the target or RMCE. The excision was the outcome of DNA recombination between the FRT1 and FRT87 sites of either the target DNA QC288A, RMCE DNA QC288A329, or the intermediates SSI DNA QC288A329FRT1 and QC288A329FRT87 with all components flanked by the border FRT1 and FRT87 sites excised (FIG. 3D). The restored FRT site could be either FRT1 or FRT87 depending on the DNA strands crossing over position. Based on the above analyses, event A1 was a RMCE/Excision event contaminated with one randomly integrated copy of the donor DNA. Target DNA on two homologous chromosomes of the homozygous target line was replaced by RMCE on one chromosome and by excision on the other since target DNA was no longer detectable by either target-specific qPCR or target 5\u2032 border, 3\u2032 border, and full length border-specific PCR analyses.",
                                "Following similar analyses described above for event A1, the following conclusions were made for the other nine events listed in FIG. 6. Event A2 was a RMCE/Excision containing a randomly integrated copy of donor and a randomly integrated copy of Flp DNA. Event A3 was a homozygous Target escape carrying about five randomly integrated copies of the donor DNA. Events B1, B2, and B4 were all RMCE/Excision events with no randomly integrated copies of donor or Flp DNA. Event B3 was a RMCE/Excision containing randomly integrated donor DNA. Event C1 was an incomplete RMCE/Excision still containing the target DNA as detected by the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end border-specific PCR analyses. The target-specific qPCR detected only 0.01 copy of target DNA for event C1. Events C2 and C3 were RMCE/RMCE (homozygous RMCE) with both the targets on homologous chromosomes being converted to RMCE since the RMCE-specific qPCR detected two copies while the target-specific qPCR as well as three border-specific PCR analyses failed to detect either any target-specific or excision-specific band. Both C2 and C3 events also contained randomly integrated donor DNA.",
                                "As examples, border-specific PCR analyses on events A1, A2, and A3 are shown in FIGS. 7A-7E. Genomic DNA samples extracted from somatic embryos of the three events were analyzed by RMCE-specific PCR specific to the 5\u2032 end border (FIG. 7A), and specific to the 3\u2032 end border (FIG. 7B). Events A1 and A2 were positive for the 1117 by RMCE 5\u2032 end border-specific band and also positive for the 1351 by RMCE 3\u2032 end border-specific band. Event A3 was negative for either the 5\u2032 end border or 3\u2032 end border band (FIG. 7A, FIG. 7B). When the same DNA samples were analyzed by Target-specific PCR specific to the 5\u2032 end border (FIG. 7C), and specific to the 3\u2032 end border (FIG. 7D), events A1 and A2 failed to produce any band. In contrast, event A3 was positive for the 1036 by Target 5\u2032 end border-specific band and also positive for the 732 by Target 3\u2032 end border-specific band (FIG. 7C, FIG. 7D). The full length 5\u2032 end border to 3\u2032 end border PCR amplified only the 1307 by Excision-specific band for events A1 and A2 but not for event A3 (FIG. 7E). The expected 6652 by RMCE-specific band that should exist in events A1 and A2 failed to be amplified due to the dominant competition advantage of the small Excision-specific products in the same PCR reactions. The same full length border-specific PCR amplified the 5063 by Target-specific band from event A3 (FIG. 7E). Wild type DNA and water templates were included as negative controls in all the analyses.",

Since A2 and its T0 plants A2-1, A2-2, A2-3, and A2-4 are all heterozygous RMCE/Excision, the full length PCR only amplified the small Excision-specific band but not the expected 6652 by large RMCE band, since PCR amplification favored the small band. In contrast, the full length PCR amplified the 6496 by RMCE band from homozygous RMCE events C2, C3 (not shown in FIGS. 9A-9E) and their T0 plants C2-1, C2-2, C2-3, C3-1, and C3-2 in the absence of the otherwise expected 1151 by Excision-band.

The predicted sequences surrounding the FRT1 site were aligned to show the differences among Target, RMCE, and Excision downstream of the FRT1 site (FIG. 10A). Depending on the crossing-over position, Excision resulted from the recombination between FRT1 and FRT87 sites could restore either the FRT87 site or the FRT1 site (Groth, A. G. and Calos, M. P., J. Mol. Biol. 335:667-678 (2003)). The predicted sequences surrounding the FRT87 site were aligned to show the differences between Target and RMCE upstream of the nos terminator on the 5\u2032 end of the FRT87 site (FIG. 10B). The sequences of the genomic DNA part upstream of the scp1 promoter on the 5\u2032 end or downstream of the QC288A 3\u2032 end, though not shown, were different between Target line A and line C and were included in the alignment analyses described below.",

The transgenic gene sequences were aligned with predicted sequences of Target, RMCE, and Excision to confirm accurate DNA recombination around the FRT1 and FRT87 sites. Sequences obtained from the border-specific PCR DNA fragments were identical to their predicted corresponding sequences. The 5\u2032 end border-specific PCR fragments sequences of RMCE samples A2-1, A2, C2-1, C3-1, and C2 (FIG. 9A) matched the RMCE sequences surrounding the FRT1 site (FIG. 10A).

Since all four A2 T0 plants were confirmed to be heterozygous for RMCE/Excision and contaminated with Donor and Flp DNA (FIG. 8), the Excision should segregate away from RMCE, and the Donor and Flp should also segregate if they were in a different site that was not linked to the RMCE/Excision target site. The RMCE-specific qPCR would detect two copies, one copy, or null of RMCE for plants that are RMCE/RMCE, RMCE/Excision, and Excision/Excision, respectively.

Seven plants were RMCE/Excision and free of any Donor or Flp. One plant was clean homozygous RMCE/RMCE and free of any Donor or Flp DNA. Consistent with previous analyses at T0 generation, all A2 T1 plants were free of the Target gene. All forty-eight C3 T1 plants were homozygous RMCE/RMCE and free of any Target or Flp consistent with the conclusion that the C3 T0 parent plants were homozygous RMCE/RMCE free of any Target or Flp (FIG. 8).

The process may take several years and require as much effort as developing a trait-containing transgenic product line. If the process of creating a target line can be combined with the development of a trait-containing transgenic product line, a target site will be obtained as a by-product once the transgenic product line is selected and well characterized. Furthermore, a trait gene or a group of genes responsible for the trait is already placed at the site making it convenient to stack new traits through RMCE. A common selectable marker gene cassette is usually used for plant transformation to facilitate the selection of transformed events, such as the 35S:hpt and sams:als cassettes used in soybean transformation (US patent publication WO 00/37662) and the 35S:bar and ubiq:gat cassettes used in maize transformation. Consequently, two incompatible recombinase recognition sites such as FRT1 and FRT87 can be incorporated in the selectable marker gene cassette which can then be linked to any trait gene of interest for transformation. Once integrated in a plant genome the incorporated FRT1 and FRT87 sites can be used for RMCE.",

To remove a few extra base pairs between the FRT1 and the als gene, the 888 by KpnI/EcoRI fragment of pZSL91 was moved to the SpeI/EcoRI sites of QC446 to form QC474. Both the SpeI and KpnI sites were first treated with mung bean nuclease to become blunt. The sams-FRT1:als:als term:FRT87 fragment of QC474 was released with NotI complete digestion and HpaI partial digestion and cloned into the NcoI and NotI sites of QC431 to form QC475, the NcoI site was first blunted with mung bean nuclease. ORFSOPTA-B (SEQ ID NO:88), with stop codons in all open reading frames, was synthesized as an oligo duplex with appropriate cloning sites incorporated on the ends and in the middle (MWG-Biotech AG). The duplex was digested with XhoI/SpeI and cloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of pZSL141 to form QC476. Finally, the 4128 by NotI/SpeI sams-FRT1:als:als term:FRT87 fragment of QC475 was moved to the NotI/SpeI sites of QC476 to form QC477 (FIG. 16A).",

Another Gateway\u00ae conversion DNA fragment containing the attR3 and attR4 recombination sites (Invitrogen) was inserted into the PmeI sites of QC477 by blunt end ligation with T4 DNA ligase to make construct QC479 and QC479i, with the Gateway\u00ae DNA fragment inverted, as the destination vectors (FIG. 16D, FIG. 16E).

                                "**Stacking of Fatty Acid Modifying Genes and Amino Acid Modifying Genes at the Target B Site by Two Rounds of SSI**",
                                "A retransformation event designated \u201cB-5\u201d, produced from the retransformation of the target B culture with the donor DNA QC329 (EXAMPLE 3), was confirmed by multiple PCR and qPCR analyses to be a RMCE event. The B-5 event containing the QC288A329 (FIG. 1C) transgenes was regenerated into fertile T0 plants. Homozygous T1 plants of B-5 were identified by qPCR and their developing embryos were used to initiate new embryogenic cultures for gene stacking experiments using donor DNA QC436 for the first round of SSI. The QC436 construct contains a promoter-less selectable marker gene HPT between the FRT1 and FRT12 sites, and between the FRT12 and FRT87 sites inverted repeats of the soybean delta 9 desaturase gene fragment (GM-FAD2-1 (TR1)) and thioesterase gene fragment (GM-THIOESTERASE 2 (TR4)) controlled by a common promoter KTI3 (FIG. 17A). Since the target DNA QC288A329 does not contain a FRT12 site, RMCE between the target QC288A329 and the donor QC436 DNA can only happen between the two FRT1 sites and the two FRT87 sites. Consequently, all the components between the FRT1 and FRT87 sites of QC288A329 can be replaced by the components between the FRT1 and FRT87 sites of QC436. The third recombination site FRT12 of QC436 is simultaneously introduced into the target B locus. Multiple retransformation events were produced and confirmed to be RMCE events by PCR and qPCR analyses (similar to EXAMPLES 3 and 4). Fatty acid profiling on somatic embryos of the QC288A436 (FIG. 17C) retransformation events revealed significantly elevated oleic acid (18:1) content, which is the phenotype expected for suppression of the endogenous delta9 desaturase and thioesterase 2 genes. One QC288A436 RMCE event culture, designated \u201cB-5-3\u201d, was selected as the new target for next round SSI using the second donor DNA QC438.",
                                "The B-5-3 culture was directly retransformed with the donor DNA QC438 as similarly described in EXAMPLE 3. QC438 contains only two recombination sites, FRT1 and FRT12. The promoter-less selectable gene ALS and four other complete transgenes are flanked by the same FRT1 and FRT12 sites (FIG. 17B). The expression of the Yarrowia diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene (YL-DGAT1) is useful for the conversion of fatty acids to triacylglycerol to increase overall oil content. The expression of the other three genes, barley high lysine (BHL8), Corynebacterium glutamicum dihydrodipicolinate synthetase gene (CORYNE DAP A), and soybean cysteine synthase gene (GM-CGS (TR1)), are useful to increase the content of essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine. Retransformation events were selected by their resistance to chlorsulfuron and analyzed by multiple PCR and qPCR analyses (similar to EXAMPLES 3 and 4, with more gene-specific primers). One event, designated \u201cB-5-3-2\u201d, was confirmed to be a RMCE stacking event containing the ALS selectable marker gene and the four traits genes YL-DGAT1, BHL8, CORYNE DAP A, and GM-CGS (TR1) of the donor QC438. The FAD2-1 and thioesterase 2 cosuppression cassette delivered by donor QC436 during the previous SSI remained intact. Fatty acid profiling of somatic embryo samples of B-5-3-2 detected the expected phenotypes of high oleic acid and high oil contents. Western analysis of somatic embryo or T0 plant leaf samples indicated the expression of all three genes, BHL8, CORYNE DAP A, and GM-CGS (TR1), which are designed to improve lysine and methionine contents."
