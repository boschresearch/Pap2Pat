    "abstract": "Dynamic, color-changing surfaces have many applications including but not limited to displays, wearables, and active camouflage. Plasmonic nanostructures can fill this role with the advantages of ultra-small pixels, high reflectivity, and post-fabrication tuning through control of the surrounding media. However, while post-fabrication tuning have yet to cover a full red-green-blue (RGB) color basis set with a single nanostructure of singular dimensions, the present invention contemplates a novel LC-based apparatus and methods that enable such tuning and demonstrates a liquid crystal-plasmonic system that covers the full red/green/blue (RGB) color basis set, as a function only of voltage. This is accomplished through a surface morphology-induced, polarization dependent, plasmonic resonance and a combination of bulk and surface liquid crystal effects that manifest at different voltages. The resulting LC-plasmonic system provides an unprecedented color range for a single plasmonic nanostructure, eliminating the need for the three spatially static sub-pixels of current displays. The system's compatibility with existing LCD technology is possible by integrating it with a commercially available thin-film-transistor (TFT) array. The imprinted surface readily interfaces with computers to display images as well as video.",

The drive to commercialize these systems has led to significant improvements in color quality, angle independence, brightness, and post-fabrication tunability. However, while most of these advances struggle to replace present commercially available technologies, the ability to change color, post-fabrication, is a distinct advantage of plasmonic systems, which may allow them to advantageously fill niche applications. For example, traditional transmissive and reflective displays typically have three sub-pixel regions with static red, green and blue color filters. These sub-pixels control the amount of each basis color transmitted or absorbed to create arbitrary colors through a process called color mixing.",

This is achieved through the onset of surface roughness-induced polarization dependence and a combination of interfacial and bulk LC effects. Each of these phenomenon dictates the color of the surface within different voltage regimes: bulk LC reorientation leading to polarization rotation in the low voltage regime, and surface LC reorientation leading to plasmonic resonance shifting at higher voltages. This hybrid LC-plasmonic tuning mechanism is modeled through a combination of finite element (FEM), Jones calculus, and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation techniques. Lastly, the scalability and compatability of this system with existing LCD technology through integration with a TFT array is demonstrated. The resultant device is then interfaced with a computer to display arbitrary images and video. This work demonstrates the potential of hybrid LC-plasmonic systems for single pixel, full-color, high resolution displays and color changing surfaces."

                                "A schematic of the liquid crystal-plasmonic apparatus is shown in FIG. 1. At the top of the device, unpolarized ambient light passes through a linear polarizer, glass superstrate, indium tin oxide (ITO), and a rubbed polyimide film. The ITO serves as a transparent electrode for applying electric fields across the liquid crystal, and the rubbed polyimide aligns the LC parallel to the axis it is rubbed (homogeneous alignment). The polarized light continues through a high birefringence LC layer (LCM1107, LC Matter Corp.) and excites grating coupled surface plasmons (GSCP) on the nanostructured aluminum surface. The LC orientation near the plasmonic surface determines the effective refractive index of the GCSP modes and, therefore, the resonant wavelength. Light that is not absorbed by the nanostructure is reflected back from the device resulting in a perceived color. The plasmonic surface constitutes the second half of the LC cell and is fabricated through the nanoimprint lithography of a 300 nm period nanowell array with an impression depth of 80 nm, which is followed by a 30 nm-thick aluminum electron beam evaporation. By changing deposition conditions and substrate temperatures the surface quality and oxide content of the film can be greatly varied. This creates a relatively rough aluminum surface (\u02dc35 nm rms), which induces a polarization dependence on the GSCP resonance in the presence of an anisotropic media, whereas it was shown in Applicant's previous work (id.) that a smooth surface (\u02dc10 nm rms) results in near polarization independence. This results in the device having two orthogonal color states in the \u201cvoltage off\u201d state (Voff), depending on the polarization of exciting light either parallel (blue) or perpendicular (red) to the LC director near the nanostructure. Also from this previous work, we found the periodic nanowell structure imparts a weak diagonal alignment on the LC with respect to the structure's grating vectors. We use this to create a 45\u00b0 twisted nematic cell by aligning the top rubbed polyimide layer with one of the grating vectors of the nanostructure. By applying a voltage across the plasmonic film and the top ITO, the orientation of the LC throughout the cell is controlled. At intermediate voltages, the bulk LC reorients and retards the incident light resulting in a partial excitation of the surface's two orthogonal \u201coff-state\u201d modes. At a specific voltage (Vth), however, the polarization is effectively rotated to excite the opposite plasmonic mode, marking a transition in color from red to blue or blue to red. This birefringent effect is wavelength dependent and can add an oscillatory absorption to the reflection spectra as light is partially absorbed on the second pass through the polarizer. However, we will show below that when the polarizer is aligned in parallel with the LC director, the color of the surface is independent of this effect. At higher voltages the bulk LC saturates vertically while the LC near the aluminum surface begins to reorient, which increases the effective refractive index experienced by the plasmonic nanostructure. This results in a continuously tunable red shift of the GCSP resonance, eventually saturating when the LC near the surface is also completely reoriented by the electric field. In this state (Vs), the surface turns green and loses its polarization dependence."

                                "Surface plasmon resonances depend greatly on the local morphology of the metallic surface and behavior can vary drastically with surface roughness and oxide content. An increase in the roughness of a metal film causes a red-shift in the resonant plasmon wavelengths and is commonly attributed to an increase in scattering. Having a distribution of roughness and grain size within a film will then have a broadening effect on the resonance. While this is normally considered detrimental for plasmonic applications like biomolecular sensing and SERS enhancement, this effect can be used advantageously for plasmonic structural color as structures that absorb broad wavelengths of light are able to produce colors not possible from those with only narrow absorption resonances. To demonstrate the impact of surface roughness on the color reflected from the nanostructure, we perform FDTD simulations of the periodic nanowell array as a function of rms roughness of the aluminum film and use the spectra to predict a reflected color using the CIE color matching functions. Here, we approximate the liquid crystal region as a perfect anisotropic crystal with the slow axis parallel to the surface and at 45\u00b0 with respect to a periodicity vector of the nanowell array (homogeneous LC alignment). This isolates the fundamental modes of the plasmonic film from the bulk retardation/polarization rotation effects of the LC. The results for incident light polarized perpendicular to the liquid crystal long-axis (90\u00b0) is shown in FIG. 2(a), while incident light polarized parallel (0\u00b0) to the liquid crystal orientation is shown in FIG. 2(b). Line colors are determined by the CIE color matching functions and are cascaded to show the influence of surface roughness on resonance location (solid black lines) and full-width-half-maximum (dotted black lines). At low values of surface roughness the plasmonic resonance shifts less than 20 nm upon incident polarization rotation, resulting in a minute color change. However, as the roughness of the aluminum increases the parallel resonance red shifts more than the perpendicular case causing a greater color shift between the two polarization states as can be seen from FIG. 2a-b. We explain this phenomenon with the following argument: as plasmonic resonances depend on the surface normal component of the surrounding refractive index, a rough film will have local regions where the surface norm has an increased x or y component compared to the global norm. This gives the in-plane components of the surrounding media a greater contribution to the effective refractive index of the GSCP resonance. In the current case, where the surrounding media is a uniaxial crystal oriented parallel to the aluminum surface, this creates a surface roughness induced polarization dependence of the plasmonic resonance. This effect has been experimentally demonstrated with two surface morphologies labelled as A and B that are obtained by controlling deposition parameters and substrate temperatures, detailed descriptions of which can be found in the Methods section herein below. The corresponding top and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images of the 30 nm aluminum films on the imprinted polymer are shown in FIG. 2(c-d). A watershed-based image segmentation method is used to find the distribution of grain diameters from the top-view SEM images (FIG. 2(c-d)). This method is described in detail in FIG. 7. In FIG. 7, the input SEM images for the \u201crough\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d aluminum thin film are shown at various steps in the watershed-based image segmentation method. The method results in a list of regions with the number of pixels contained therein. The area of each region is then converted into an approximate grain diameter. Thereafter, the regions are mapped back onto the image in the form of white lines to confirm the methods functionality. Histograms of the two surfaces show a mean grain diameter of 12 nm for the \u201cA\u201d surface (FIGS. 2(c)) and 33 nm for the \u201cB\u201d aluminum surface (FIG. 2(d)). The surfaces are then made into LC cells and infiltrated with LCM1107. FIG. 2(e-f) shows the resulting reflection spectra of the respective surfaces (solid lines) compared to simulated spectra (dotted lines) for incident polarizations parallel (0\u00b0) and perpendicular (90\u00b0) to the top rubbed polyimide alignment layer. Output light of all polarizations is collected to ensure the spectra originate purely from the plasmonic surface. Line colors of the spectra are generated by the CIE color matching method while the microscope image insets show the experimentally achieved colors. The histograms of the respective aluminum surfaces are used in a weighted average of the FDTD spectra of FIG. 2(a-b) and result in a close matching to the experimental spectra. The relief depth of the structure in FDTD simulations has also been varied between 80-90 nm to provide a better matching to experimental spectra and account for small variances in the imprinting process. The relatively smooth aluminum film, A, gives a small change in color upon polarization rotation, from an orange to a reddish-orange, associated with a 20 nm shift in GCSP resonance. On the contrary, the aluminum surface, B, with higher surface roughness gives a more drastic color change upon polarization rotation, from blue to red (FIG. 2(f)) and is the result of a 60 nm shift in resonant wavelength. Hence, by controlling the surface morphology via deposition conditions, the degree of polarization dependence of the resultant color can be controlled. Exciting the surface with polarization angles between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 or unpolarized light results in a superposition of these two spectra (FIG. 8(a-b)). An example of this is that the surface B when excited with unpolarized light results in a purple color (FIG. 8(c))."

                                "To achieve all three basis colors (RGB) as a function only of voltage a combination of bulk and surface liquid crystal effects are utilized. The periodic nanowell structure imparts a weak diagonal alignment on the LC with respect to the structure's grating vectors, which is used to create a 45\u00b0 twisted nematic cell by aligning the top rubbed polyimide layer with one of the grating vectors of the nanostructure. A cell gap of 8.5 \u03bcm ensures the alignment of the top polyimide does not overpower that of the nanostructure to result in a homogeneous cell. These boundary conditions, along with the LC material parameters are used in FEM simulations (TechWiz LCD 3D, Sanayi) to find the LC director throughout the cell as a function of voltage. A Jones matrix approach is then used to find the polarization of light as it propagates through the cell. This is done by approximating the LC cell as a stack of N number of phase plates with a continuous variation in retardation. The LC director at that cell location determines the anisotropic refractive index of each layer. A detailed description of the process is provided herein below. The resulting LC directors and polarization ellipse throughout the cell for three selected voltages are represented in FIG. 3(a). While the FEM and Jones matrix calculations are found to converge with N=100, the figures in FIG. 3(a) depict a gridded subsampling for graphical purposes. The top row shows incident polarized light parallel to the top LC director as it propagates down towards the nanostructure, while the bottom row depicts the light after reflection and as it propagates out of the cell. At V=0 (A), the LC creates a 45\u00b0 twisted nematic cell where the propagating light maintains its linear polarization and is rotated by the LC director in what's known as the Maugin (or Waveguiding) regime. This is given by the following condition:",
                                "\\({\\varphi \ue89e{\\operatorname{<<}\\; \ue89e\\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi}}\ue89e\\Delta \ue89e\\; \ue89e{nd}},\\)",
                                "where \u03d5 is the twist angle of the cell, An is the birefringence of the LC, \u03bb is the wavelength of light, and d is the thickness of the LC cell. Here we can see that light exits the cell with the same polarization as input and is, therefore, unaffected by a second pass through the polarizer. As voltage is increased, the Fredericks transition marks the initial tilt of the LC from their voltage-off state and is followed by a continuous change in tilt along the applied electric field. This tilting reduces the effective \u0394n of the cell, which eventually breaks the Maugin condition and begins changing the ellipticity of the light, as can be seen in (B) and (C) of FIG. 3(a). To verify this LC mode, we use the experimental setup illustrated in FIG. 3(b) and compare with simulations from the combined FEM-Jones approach. The experiment consists of light from a He\u2014Ne laser that passes through a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and is incident upon the plasmonic-LC device. In this case, the polarization of incident light is parallel to the rubbing of the top alignment layer. Light is reflected from the device and back into the PBS, which reflects the orthogonal polarization of light to a silicon photodiode. A voltage is then adiabatically applied to the sample at a rate of 0.01 Vs\u22121, well below that of the cell's transient optical effects. The results of the experiment are shown in FIG. 3(c) and represent the degree of polarization rotation imparted on the light as a function of voltage. Jones matrix simulations of a 45\u00b0 twisted nematic cell with a parallel input polarizer and perpendicular output analyzer (both with respect to the top LC director) match well with the experimental curve. A close to zero reflection indicates that the light is leaving the cell with the same polarization as it entered. This can only occur if the light reflects off the plasmonic surface in a linear polarization state, as can be seen in the selected voltage cases (A) and (B). On the contrary, peaks in the curve indicate voltages at which light leaves the cell at a perpendicular polarization than as it entered, which occurs due to the change in hand of reflected circular polarized light (C). While this verifies the bulk LC mechanics of the cell, to understand this effect's impact on the color of reflected light we look at the polarization of light as it excites the plasmonic surface. The two orthogonal modes of the surface-B are shown in FIG. 3(d). These spectra are obtained at 0 V and when the polarization of incident light is parallel (0\u00b0) and perpendicular (90\u00b0) to the top polyimide alignment layer, respectively. Since the cell is in the Maugin regime at this state, the incident light remains either parallel or perpendicular to the LC director as it excites the plasmonic surface. Within a low-voltage regime, where only the bulk LC changes orientation and the LC near the surface remains constant, the spectra is a linear combination of the two orthogonal basis spectra with a wavelength dependent weighting, \u03b1 and \u03b2. These weighting terms are given by the projection of the electric field exciting the nanostructure on the axes parallel and perpendicular to the LC director, respectively. FIG. 3(e) shows experimentally obtained reflection spectra of the surface with a voltage of 3.5 V (Vth) where, for a given incident polarization, the spectra flips to the orthogonal state's color. Using the Jones Matrix method to find \u03b1 and \u03b2, the resulting spectra closely match with experiment. Detailed steps for obtaining \u03b1 and \u03b2, as well as their exact values for this case are provided herein below.",
                                "As voltage is increased, the LC near the nanostructure and within the plasmonic fields of the surface begins to tilt. This increases the effective refractive index of the GCSP modes and continuously red-shifts their resonant wavelengths. Once this occurs, the two state approach used above is no longer valid, but also not needed to predict the device's end-state reflection spectra. At saturation voltage (Vs), the LC near the surface becomes asymptotically vertical, which results in the loss of the nanostructure's polarization dependence, as well as the bulk LC's birefringent properties. This is demonstrated in FIG. 4(a) where the voltage and polarization dependent reflection spectra of the device is shown. Again, line colors are generated by overlap integration between the measured spectra and the CIE color matching functions and insets show optical microscope images of the surface. The two top rows of spectra are of the surface when excited with polarized light parallel and perpendicular to the LC alignment director, respectively, and light of all polarizations are collected. While this confirms that the color is generated purely by the plasmonic surface, light from a practical device, in which the polarizer is laminated to the top, would pass through the polarizer a second time. The bottom-most row of spectra in FIG. 4(a) shows the influence of this second pass on the color of the surface as an analyzer is added in parallel with the polarizer. In the off-state, the spectra are invariant to the addition of an analyzer as the LC is in the waveguiding regime as described in FIG. 3(a). For this state, the experimental spectra match closely with the histogram-weighted FDTD spectra. At an applied voltage of 3.5 V, the reflected color flips due to the polarization rotation of incident light as it passes through the LC cell. The simulated spectra for this applied field is obtained by using the wavelength dependent weighting factors, \u03b1 and \u03b2, on the FDTD results at V=0. The second pass through the polarizer is simulated by adding an analyzer to the Jones calculus method. Here, there is a slight change in spectra with the addition of the analyzer, however, the changes do not greatly impact the reflected spectra and color. At saturation voltage (LC on state), the first order plasmonic resonance shifts to 600 nm and a second order resonance moves to 500 nm. This results in a green color reflected from the surface, which can be confirmed by FDTD with an anisotropic media where nz=ne and nx=ny=no of the LC. Here, we also see that the effect of the analyzer is minimal, which is consistent with the LC being nearly vertical throughout the cell. To demonstrate this phenomenon without a microscope we show camera images of a large area sample through a polarizing film in FIG. 4(b) for selected polarizations and voltages. Here, our devices are 1 in2 in area and limited by the size and quality of our existing stamp, however, large area (36 in2) and roll-to-roll nanoimprinting has been demonstrated that could allow scaling of the device to hand-held and notebook dimensions with high pattern fidelity. Another critical aspect of the resultant device is color quality. FIG. 4(c) shows the CIE chromaticity diagram and microscope images of the surface as a function of voltage when the polarizer, LC director and analyzer are parallel. Black dots indicate the coordinates of the reflection spectra and a dotted black line shows the total area the surface could span if integrated in a color-mixing scheme. Due to the absorptive nature of the color generating phenomenon, the color gamut is less than that of the NTSC standard, but comparable in area to that of high quality print magazine (AAAS Science)."

A schematic is shown in FIG. 5(a) and depicts the case where incident light is polarized parallel to the LC director. Two angles of incidence are defined: \u03c6, where the polarization of light is parallel to the axis of rotation (TE, s-polarized), and \u03b8, when the polarization of light is perpendicular to the axis of rotation (TM, p-polarized). For the incident angle \u03c6, there is an expected angle independence from the experimental measurements in FIG. 5(b).

Black lines depict this GCSP dispersion relation when corrected for refraction at the top glass and LC interfaces. The results of these figures clearly show an area of improvement for a display utilizing this phenomenon. While an ideal display has little dependence on viewing position, this device has an angle independence in one axis of rotation but a dependence in the other. However, by orienting the display along the preferred viewing angle, the display can be made almost angle independent. Furthermore, through the use of a compensation film or a nanostructure with alternative plasmonic modes, the viewing angle dependence could be improved and optimized."

                                "Once a color gamut is obtained the system can be combined with various addressing schemes. A critical advantage of the proposed LC-plasmonic system is its facile integration with pre-existing display technologies. To demonstrate this capability, a conventional transmissive TN LCD panel was used (Adafruit, ID: 1680) and isolated the thin film transistor array by removing the back light, polarizers, diffusers and ITO glass. The nanostructured aluminum surface is UV cured onto the TFT glass plate with 8.5 \u03bcm spacers and then filled with LCM1107. FIG. 6(a) shows a microscope image of the resulting device (10\u00d7) in which the electrical components of the TFT can be clearly seen. Light passes through a polarizer, ITO windows and LC to reflect off the plasmonic surface and back out of the device. The white areas are due to reflection off the metal lines of the TFT. In the voltage-off state, the entire surface is either blue or red, depending on the polarization of incident light with respect to the top LC alignment director. By keeping the electronics of the TFT intact, the device is interfaced with a computer through a HDMI-to-TTL converter. Individual pixels are then controlled through images the computer outputs to the display. FIG. 6(b) shows how the surface changes color by applying a voltage to every 3rd and 4th row of the TFT. Full images can be displayed as shown in FIG. 6(c). While this shows the ease at which LC-plasmonic systems can be integrated with existing TFTs, the prototype device has several engineering challenges to overcome. The white reflection from the TFT metal lines, meant for use in transmissive displays, tends to wash out color from the underlying plasmonic surface. A black matrix needs to be superimposed on TFT metal lines to mitigate this. Alternatively, fabrication of the plasmonic surface on the TFT glass itself will solve this unwanted reflection problem. Secondly, the off-the-shelf TFT drivers only source \u02dc10 Vrms; not enough for the surface's transition to green for the present cell gap of 8.5 \u03bcm. TFT drivers capable of sourcing 15-20 V are needed in conjunction with a reduction in cell gap. The voltage needed for saturation is proportional to the thickness of the LC layer, but changes in this gap will alter the intermediate-voltage optical properties of the device. With proper engineering of these parameters we believe the max operating voltage of the cell can be greatly reduced while maintaining its color changing functionality. In absence of the required TFT in present academic setting, a passively addressed device is shown in FIG. 6(d). Here, UV lithography is performed to macroscopically pattern the nanostructured surface, which is followed by a blanket deposition of aluminum. Treating this surface as the \u201ccommon,\u201d we pattern the top ITO glass to have individual control of each letter in \u201cUCF.\u201d Furthermore, we utilize a UV photoalignment material (PAAD-22, Beam Co.) instead of a physically rubbed polyimide to demonstrate how the off-state colors can be varied throughout a single device and with a single laminated polarizer. This azobenzene based material, when exposed with linearly polarized UV light, aligns the LC homogeneously and perpendicularly to the polarization of exposure. Here, the alignment layer above the \u201cU\u201d is exposed orthogonally with respect to the polarization of exposure above the \u201cCF.\u201d The segmented top ITO/photoalignment substrate is then aligned with the \u201cUCF\u201d plasmonic surface and the resulting cell is infiltrated with LCM1107. By changing the orientation of the LC alignment director with respect to the top polarizer, the \u201cU\u201d and the \u201cCF\u201d change between orthogonal colors. Lastly, we apply a field across the \u201cC\u201d to obtain a green and demonstrate how the three RGB basis colors can be obtained from a single nanostructure/pixel. Lastly, the unoptimized switching characteristics of the device are shown in Supplementary FIG. 5 and show voltage dependent rise and fall times. Full cycling times are somewhat invariant to voltage and in the 70 ms range, which equates to \u02dc14 Hz. While it is believed that this can be improved to standard display frame rates, it remains orders of magnitude faster than other reported color changing technologies such as electrochemical or translocation based methods, which take seconds to tens of seconds to change."

This is achieved using a single, continuous, aluminum nanostructure in conjunction with a high birefringence LC. By controlling the deposition conditions of the aluminum, a surface roughness induced polarization dependence is realized in the presence of a surrounding anisotropic media. This phenomena is then exploited through its integration with a LC cell that performs as a polarization rotator at low voltages while shifting the plasmonic resonance of the aluminum nanostructure at higher voltages. Large area nanoimprint lithography based scalable fabrication of the nanostructure combined with its ready integration with LC technology can lead to a new class of LC-plasmonic devices."
