    "abstract": "Simul-seq profiles genomes and transcriptomes by uniquely barcoding DNA and RNA reads from the same material. Paired DNA and RNA profiling is increasingly employed in genomics research to uncover molecular mechanisms of disease and to explore personal genotype and phenotype correlations. Here, we introduce Simul-seq, a technique for the production of high-quality whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing libraries from small quantities of cells or tissues. We apply the method to laser-capture-microdissected esophageal adenocarcinoma tissue, revealing a highly aneuploid tumor genome with extensive blocks of increased homozygosity and corresponding increases in allele-specific expression. Among this widespread allele-specific expression, we identify germline polymorphisms that are associated with response to cancer therapies. We further leverage this integrative data to uncover expressed mutations in several known cancer genes as well as a recurrent mutation in the motor domain of KIF3B that significantly affects kinesin\u2013microtubule interactions. Simul-seq provides a new streamlined approach for generating comprehensive genome and transcriptome profiles from limited quantities of clinically relevant samples.",

                        "To rigorously assess the specificity of the Simul-seq method, we first produced libraries derived from a mixture of 50 ng of human genomic DNA and 100 ng of yeast mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We quantified the presence of both DNA-seq and RNA-seq libraries in the pool using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR; Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Subsequent sequencing and alignment of the dual-indexed reads to the yeast and human genomes revealed cross-species mapping rates that were similar to those observed in yeast RNA-seq and human DNA-seq libraries produced independently (Fig. 1b), indicating that the Simul-seq method specifically barcodes the DNA and RNA with distinct adapters. Next, we leveraged these adapters to optimize read outputs for various applications and starting material inputs using differential PCR. To verify this approach, we varied the number of PCR cycles with RNA primers alone while holding the number of cycles with both DNA and RNA primers constant. Inclusion of RNA-specific cycles increased the fraction of the total library derived from RNA, as measured by ddPCR (Fig. 1c). Moreover, ddPCR quantification of the DNA and RNA constituents before sequencing was also highly correlated with subsequent read outputs (Fig. 1d), enabling users to perform quality control on the mixed libraries before high-throughput sequencing."

In parallel, we also prepared independent RNA-seq libraries from these cells using an analogous RNA-ligase-based protocol. For the Simul-seq library, we obtained 560,218,621 and 57,091,162 dual-indexed DNA and RNA 101-bp paired-end reads, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). 93% of Simul-seq DNA reads mapped to the genome, producing an average genomic depth of 31.9 \u00d7 (Fig. 2a). Although the Simul-seq coverage distribution was consistent with the distribution obtained from a library previously generated using an established DNA-seq method11 (Fig. 2a), the distribution exhibited some sequencing bias characteristic of the Tn5 transposase12. To further explore potential coverage biases, we generated Lorenz curves comparing the cumulative fraction of mapped bases with the cumulative fraction of the genome covered. Both the Simul-seq and the DNA-seq control genomes exhibited comparable read distributions (Fig. 2b), indicating that pooled DNA and RNA library preparation and sequencing does not introduce sequencing bias in excess of standard methods.",
                        "Whole-genome sequencing is generally performed to identify variants that are polymorphic among populations or associated with disease. Therefore, we next compared variant calls between the Simul-seq and control DNA-seq genomes. Of the 3,635,954 SNVs determined in the Simul-seq genome, 95.6% were concordant with SNVs called in the standard DNA-seq genome (Fig. 2c). In addition, the identity and size distribution of small insertions and deletions (indels) identified in the Simul-seq genome were similar to those obtained from the DNA-seq genome, with 87.5% of Simul-seq-derived indels exhibiting concordance with the standard genome (Fig. 2d). These degrees of concordance were comparable to those observed from previously published biologic replicates using a standard DNA-seq approach11 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), demonstrating that Simul-seq produces high-quality whole-genome data."

                        "Next, we examined the quality of the RNA sequencing data. Similar to RNA-seq control data, Simul-seq RNA reads were effectively depleted for ribosomal sequences and mapped primarily to transcribed regions of the genome (Fig. 3a). Simul-seq RNA reads were also highly strand specific and evenly distributed across the length of transcripts (Fig. 3b,c), enabling accurate transcriptome quantification and isoform analysis. As a control, Simul-seq DNA reads mapped primarily to intronic and intergenic regions of the genome and were evenly distributed between each DNA strand, as expected (Fig. 3a,b). To rigorously assess the technical variation of transcript quantification, External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) RNA standards13 were spiked into the total nucleic acid mixture. Simul-seq produced ERCC transcript measurements that were both highly correlated with the known ERCC concentrations as well as with RNA-seq control ERCC measurements (Fig. 3d). The Simul-seq-derived transcriptome contained 7,992 protein-coding genes as well as an additional 1,123 noncoding genes that would be largely undetected with poly-A enrichment (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) measurements were both reproducible and well correlated with RNA-seq control FPKMs (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the Simul-seq protocol efficiently produces high-quality whole-genome sequencing data and RNA sequencing data, allowing for the comprehensive profiling of genomic and transcriptomic variation from the same cell population. In addition, we have applied the method to as few as 50,000 fibroblasts, obtaining coverage distributions and variant calls (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b) as well as FPKM and ERCC expression data (Supplementary Fig. 5c,d) that were both reproducible and well correlated with our previous results."

                        "Integrative DNA and RNA profiling is increasingly employed in cancer genomics to distinguish driver mutations of various types (e.g., protein coding, regulatory, structural variants, etc.) from the multitude of passenger mutations1,14,15. To test Simul-seq in this tissue context, we applied the method to laser-capture-microdissected material (\u223c150 \u03bcg) isolated from a male subject with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Deep sequencing of the Simul-seq EAC library produced 727,341,682 DNA and 191,398,961 RNA 101-bp dual-indexed paired-end reads, with 95.1% and 79.4% of the reads mapping to the genome and transcriptome, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly to the data acquired from fibroblasts, the Simul-seq RNA reads primarily mapped to transcribed regions, were highly strand specific and evenly distributed over transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). However, the percentage of reads mapping to introns was increased for this library, suggesting an increased rate of intron retention and/or number of unspliced transcripts in this tumor specimen (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The tumor genome was sequenced to an average coverage of 38\u00d7 and displayed a skewed coverage distribution indicative of large-scale copy-number alterations (Fig. 4a).",
                        "Comparing the Simul-seq tumor genome with a DNA-seq paired normal genome revealed a highly aneuploid genomic landscape, with somatic evidence for 142 structural variants and 9 expressed gene fusions as well as 15,607 SNVs and 2,904 indels (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 2\u20135). Globally, the ratio of heterozygous to homozygous SNPs for the tumor genome was 0.49, an exceptional deviation from the typically observed ratio of \u223c1.5 (Fig. 2c) that indicated widespread loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (Fig. 4c). Analysis of allele-specific expression using the Simul-seq EAC transcriptome data provided further support for extensive LOH, with 92.9% of the identified allele-specific transcripts exhibiting average major allele frequencies of greater than or equal to 0.9 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 6). Given the high levels of LOH-induced allele-specific expression (ASE) in the tumor, we hypothesized that damaging germline variants in tumor suppressor genes might be specifically expressed in the tumor. Indeed, we identified eight nonsynonymous variants in tumor suppressor genes (as defined by the TSGene 2.0 database16) where a PolyPhen-2 (ref. 17)- and SIFT18-predicted damaging allele was predominantly expressed (Supplementary Table 7).",
                        "To distill the 15,607 somatic SNVs into potential oncogenic mutations, we integrated the Simul-seq DNA and RNA data to identify 29 expressed nonsynonymous somatic mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). In addition to representing potential driver mutations, these expressed protein-altering mutations are also possible neoantigens from which patient-specific immunotherapies may be derived19\u201321. Notably, three Cosmic Cancer census genes22 (TP53, ATM and ESWR1) were found to harbor expressed somatic missense mutations. While ESWR1 is typically a constituent of an oncogenic fusion protein, and the R45W mutation in the ATM serine/threonine kinase tumor suppressor is not yet characterized, the Y220C mutation is a known TP53 hotspot that decreases protein stability23,24. Moreover, we found that the TP53 locus exclusively expressed the damaging allele (Table 1), exacerbating the loss of TP53 function and likely underpinning the widespread genomic instability observed in this tumor specimen. Interestingly, this patient also exhibited ASE for common germline polymorphisms in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR, rs2227983) as well as the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1, rs9344) (Supplementary Table 6), polymorphisms that are associated with response to chemotherapeutic treatments25\u201328."

                        "In addition to discovering clinically relevant alterations in known cancer genes, we observed an expressed arginine-to-tryptophan mutation in KIF3B (R293W), a type II kinesin motor protein. Although several kinesin family members have established roles in cancer29, KIF3B somatic coding mutations have not been previously described. KIF3B has been linked to the intracellular trafficking of several tumor suppressor genes29,30, and biochemical data have shown that substitution of specific arginine and lysine residues within the kinesin motor domain negatively impacts kinesin-microtubule association31. To further explore KIF3B mutation frequency in EAC, we performed targeted resequencing of the KIF3B locus in a cohort of 49 EAC samples, with 25 paired normals. Overall, KIF3B harbored verified nonsynonymous mutations in \u223c6% of the tumor samples, and the R293W mutation was observed in a second independent patient (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). To investigate the functional consequences of this recurrent R293W mutation, we purified recombinant wild-type and mutant KIF3B motor domains (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). When compared with the wild-type domain, the mutant motor domain displayed a significantly reduced rate of ATP hydrolysis upon incubation with various concentrations of microtubules, suggesting that the R293W mutation abrogates kinesin\u2013microtubule binding (Fig. 5b). Together, these results demonstrate the benefits of Simul-seq in providing comprehensive DNA and RNA data sets, leading to the annotation of several clinically important variants as well as the description of a functionally significant recurrent mutation."

                "As sequencing technologies advance and more individuals are profiled in both clinical and research settings, straightforward methods for generating comprehensive and accurate whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data will become increasingly valuable. The combined sequencing of both DNA and RNA from single cells was recently enabled by the development of two methods, DR-seq32 and G&T-seq33. Simul-seq provides a complementary approach that focuses on producing comprehensive DNA and RNA profiles from limited quantities of tissues or cells rather than single cells. In contrast to previous dual-sequencing approaches, Simul-seq generates a single pooled library, and thus both reduces the library preparation time and keeps paired data sets physically linked. Importantly, whereas DR-seq and G&T-seq depend upon polyadenylation to distinguish RNA transcripts from genomic DNA, the use of RNA ligase in Simul-seq allows for a ribosomal RNA depletion step. Therefore, Simul-seq retains biologically and clinically important nonpolyadenylated RNA transcripts and may reduce 3\u2032 bias for samples with lower RNA quality34,35. Overall, Simul-seq produces high-quality DNA and RNA sequencing data, enabling genotype and phenotype comparisons in a single workflow.",
                "Cancer genome interpretation is one scenario where integration of precise and comprehensive DNA and RNA landscapes has proven useful but can be challenging on account of limited starting material. Moreover, tumor heterogeneity increases the likelihood of discrepancies between genome and transcriptome profiles prepared in parallel on separate cell populations. Applying Simul-seq to laser-capture-microdissected tumor tissue revealed a highly aneuploid somatic landscape, including a recurrent R293W mutation in KIF3B that dramatically reduced kinesin\u2013microtubule interaction. Although the \u223c6% mutation frequency that we observed is consistent with recently published data from whole-genome sequencing of 22 esophageal adenocarcinomas36, KIF3B has not been classified as a cancer gene in large-scale EAC exome sequencing studies37,38. These efforts, however, are still largely statistically underpowered14. Intriguingly, overexpression of C-terminal truncations of KIF3B-induced aneuploidy in NIH3T3 cells39. Moreover, KIF3B has been linked to the intracellular trafficking of several tumor suppressors, including the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)30 and von Hippel\u2013Lindau (VHL)29 proteins. Together, our findings suggest that additional experiments are warranted to delineate specific functional roles for KIF3B mutation in esophageal tumorigenesis.",
                "In addition to the novel KIF3B mutation, we also identified a number of clinically relevant variants in this EAC patient sample. We observed a known TP53 hotspot mutation (Y220C) that destabilizes the TP53 protein at body temperatures24 and is also a target of several small molecules designed to restore TP53 function in tumors23,40. TP53 inactivation followed by whole-genome duplication and chromosomal catastrophe is a frequent trajectory for EAC development36,41 and is consistent with our observations for this tumor. Among the widespread LOH induced by this genomic instability, we detected ASE for germline variants with pharmacogenomic links to the efficacy of cancer therapies used in EAC. The EGFR polymorphism (rs2227983) observed in this patient is associated with increased survival of colorectal cancer patients treated with Cetuximab27,28, perhaps via attenuation of EGFR pathway signaling42. In contrast, the patient harbored a second variant in CCND1 (rs9344) that is inversely correlated with overall survival in colorectal cancer patients treated with Cetuximab43. In both cases, however, the beneficial allele was predominantly expressed in the tumor, suggesting a positive overall response. Taken together, our results in this EAC patient both highlight the utility of Simul-seq as well as the many benefits of acquiring combined DNA and RNA profiles for genome interpretation and personalized medicine."

This reaction was incubated for 5 min at 55 \u00b0C, and the thermocycler was cooled to 10 \u00b0C before the reaction was placed on ice. 100 \u03bcl Ampure XP RNAclean beads (Beckman Coulter: A63987), or 2\u00d7 the reaction volume, were then added to the reaction and incubated for 10\u201315 min to bind the nucleic acids. The beads were placed on a magnet stand until clear, washed twice with 400 \u03bcl of 80% ethanol and dried for 10 min at room temperature The total nucleic acids were eluted from the dried beads using 7 \u03bcl of H2O. To remove secondary RNA structure, 6 \u03bcl of the eluate and 1 \u03bcl of the 3\u2032 ligation adapter were first heated to 65 \u00b0C for 5 min and then immediately placed on ice. For ligation of the 3\u2032 adapter to the RNA molecules, 10 \u03bcl of 3\u2032 ligation buffer and 3 \u03bcl of 3\u2032 ligation enzyme mix were added and incubated for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C in a thermal cycler with the lid heated to 50 \u00b0C. To reduce adapter\u2013adapter ligation products, 1 \u03bcl of the reverse transcription primer (SR RT primer) and 4.5 \u03bcl of H2O were added to the 3\u2032 adapter ligation reaction and incubated in a PCR machine for 5 min at 65 \u00b0C, 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, 15 min at 25 \u00b0C and held at 4 \u00b0C until the next step.

This reaction was incubated for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C with the lid heated to 50 \u00b0C and then placed on ice. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by adding 8 \u03bcl of first-strand reaction buffer, 1 \u03bcl of murine RNase inhibitor and 1\u03bcl of ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase to the previous mixture and incubating the reaction for 1 h at 42 \u00b0C with the lid heated to 50 \u00b0C. 48 \u03bcl of Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter: A63880), or 1.2\u00d7 of the reaction volume, were then used to clean up the cDNA and transposed genomic DNA. The beads were incubated for 5\u201310 min with the DNA, washed twice with 80% ethanol and mixed with 26.5 \u03bcl of H2O to elute the DNA. PCR conditions varied depending on whether differential PCR was performed. DNA libraries were amplified using standard Nextera indexing primers. RNA libraries were amplified with a custom I5 indexing primer AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTA CACTATCCTCTGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCG-s-A, where -s- indicates a phosphorothioate bond, and a standard I7 indexing primer. For differential PCR, 25.5 \u03bcl of the eluate was combined with 1.25 \u03bcl of each RNA indexing primer (10 mM stock) and 12 \u03bcl Nextera PCR Master Mix (NPM) and then thermocycled as follows: 72 \u00b0C for 3 min; 98 \u00b0C for 30 s; then two to seven cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 62 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 3 min; before a final hold at 4 \u00b0C. After this hold, the reaction was removed from the thermocycler and combined with 12.5 \u03bcl of a master mix comprising 2.5 \u03bcl of each DNA indexing PCR primer (5 mM stock), 5 \u03bcl of PPC and 5 \u03bcl NPM. This combined reaction was then subjected to five additional cycles using the same program described above. The fibroblast, LCM and 50,000 fibroblast Simul-seq libraries used two, four and seven cycles of RNA-specific PCR, respectively. The final libraries were cleaned using 66 \u03bcl Ampure XP beads as described above and eluted in 12 \u03bcl of H20. To quality control the dual-indexed libraries, we performed high-sensitivity Qubit DNA and Bioanalyzer assays prior to sequencing of paired-end 101 bp reads on Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq machines. A typical Simul-seq library will be approximately 10 ng/ml, with an average size distribution of \u223c350 bp (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
