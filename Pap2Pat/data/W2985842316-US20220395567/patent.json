                        "The sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea, is a commonly reported communicable disease and poses a worldwide risk. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) which is a gram-negative diplococcus. Although N. gonorrhoeae primarily infects mucous membranes, it is capable of invading tissues and evading host defenses. N. gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of a spectrum of sequelae. These sequelae range from asymptomatic mucosal infections to significant disease syndromes in both sexes, for example, disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) in men and women, as well as salpingitis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women. Other sequelae include, recurrent infection, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, pelvic adhesions and other lasting inflammatory effects.",
                        "N. gonorrhoeae has multiple virulence factors. The surface components of this pathogen play an important role in attaching to and invading host cells, while providing potential targets for the host immune response. Gonococcal infections elicit local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses to several components which are exhibited as surface exposed antigens of the bacterium, particularly pili, porin (Por) or protein I (PI), opacity associated proteins (Opas) or protein Hs, Rmp or protein III, and lipooligosaccharides (LOS). Pili, Opa, Por, and LOS are all implicated in attachment to and invasion of the host and all display considerable variation on their surface exposed regions.",
                        "In both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, gonococcal infections have been shown to stimulate increased levels of anti-gonococcal serum immunoglobulins. The peripheral humoral response is predominately IgG (mostly subclass IgG3), with lesser amounts of IgM and IgA. Quantitatively, the antibody response is primarily directed against the pili, Opa proteins, and LOS. Local antibodies are present in genital secretions, but in reduced amounts, and may be directed against different antigenic targets than those in serum. The predominant class of antibodies present in secretions is also IgG (mostly IgG3) and not secretory IgA (sigA). Antibodies against LOS are present as well, but in lesser amounts than those against pili, Por, and Opa. Although patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae may show an antibody response to many gonococcal antigens, N. gonorrhoeae isolated from patients with disseminated infection (DGI) are resistant to the bactericidal action of normal human serum (NHS) and of most convalescent sera. This serum-resistant phenotype, termed stable serum resistance (SR), may enable the organism to evade local defenses, penetrate mucosal barriers and disseminate via the bloodstream.",
                        "Attempts to use individual surface components of the pathogen as targets for conventional vaccines have been unsuccessful because of their antigenic variability. Pilus vaccines have been protective only against infection with the homologous strain (used to make the pilus vaccine) and Por vaccination has been unsuccessful even in human experimental challenge. In addition, N. gonorrhoeae express marked phenotypic heterogeneity, typically shifting from one antigenic form to another at a frequency of >1 in 103 organisms making the surface of this organism a moving target for most vaccine strategies. Although the vaccine candidates have provoked antibody responses, the antibodies and immune responses produced have not been broadly protective."

                        "Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae), the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, has become resistant to almost every antibiotic in clinical use. Currently, the combination of the antibiotics ceftriaxone and azithromycin is the first-line of treatment for gonorrhea recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, resistance to each of these antibiotics has been reported in several countries, which further limits treatment options. In addition, the number of cases of gonorrhea is increasing rapidly. In 2017, 555,608 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC, a 67% increase in the number of cases in five years (www.cdc.gov/std/statsl7/Gonorrhea.htm).

In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.",

                                "Activation of the classical pathway of complement requires engagement of the C1 complex (subunits of C1q, C1r, and C1s), triggered by Fc antibody domains. Upon binding to surfaces, Fc domains of proximate IgG molecules form ordered hexamers through non-covalent interactions, which then simultaneously engage multiple globular heads of C1q, also a hexameric molecule. Multimeric interactions between globular domains of C1q and Fc convert otherwise low-affinity monomeric IgG Fc-C1q associations to interactions of high avidity, which permits autocatalysis of C1r and further complement activation. An effective bactericidal antibody requires a critical density of surface targets to engage C1q and permit complement activation. On a molar basis, LOS is the most abundant gonococcal outer membrane molecule and serves as a convenient target for binding of closely spaced antibody molecules whose Fc domains can then readily engage the Cl complex an activate complement. An intact complement pathway is necessary and sufficient for efficacy of mAb 2C7 in the mouse vaginal colonization model (Gulati S et al. PLoS Biol. 2019 Jun 19;17(6):e3000323. PMID:). The importance of complement in host defenses against gonorrhea, is highlighted by the observation that both congenital and acquired defects of individual terminal components of complement are associated with an increased incidence of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). Based on the data with mAb 2C7, it is proposed that attenuation of colonization by antibodies elicited by TMCP2 vaccine also occurs via complement-dependent bactericidal antibody activity. A vaccine candidate that comprises gonococcal outer membrane vesicles plus microencapsulated IL-12 given intravaginally requires B cell activity, presumably to produce antibodies, however, a requirement for complement has not been shown.",
                                "No other gonococcal vaccine candidates tested in the cervico-vaginal colonization model in estradiol-treated mice show sterilizing immunity. Immunomodulatory effects of estrogen may curb immune defenses that are important to clear N. gonorrhoeae. Seminal studies showed that the activity of terminal complement components in male mice exceeds, by 8-to 10-fold, activity in female mice. Administration of testosterone increases complement activity; estrogen has the opposite effect. Therefore, a vaccine antibody response that utilizes terminal complement to act in concert with the bactericidal action of antibody may also require waning of the suppressive effects of estrogen on terminal complement components before full bactericidal activity is restored.",
                                "A retrospective epidemiologic analysis showed that a detergent extracted meningococcal outer membrane vesicle (dOMV) vaccine called MeNZB designed and implemented in a widespread vaccination program to control an epidemic of group B meningococcal disease in New Zealand, showed diminished coverage in populations subsequently infected with N. gonorrhoeae\u2014calculated as 31% effectiveness of MenZB in decreasing gonococcal infection\u2014reduced to 14% in populations co-infected with N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia, a frequent clinical occurrence. Meningococci and gonococci share several similarities and it is possible that one or more proteins in MeNZB that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae may elicit protective immune responses. Subjects administered a licensed group B meningococcal vaccine, BEXSERO\u00ae, which contains 5 recombinant meningococcal protein antigens in addition to the same dOMV that constitutes MeNZB, elicit antibodies, immunochemically, that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae. However, in a separate study, bactericidal antibody activity against N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 in immune sera from subjects vaccinated with BEXSERO\u00ae was not observed. How MeNZB provides protection against gonorrhea remains unclear. Currently, several gonococcal vaccine candidates are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation, some of which elicit bactericidal activity. Knowledge of the immune defenses responsible for clearing gonococcal infection is an important aspect of developing effective vaccines against this disease.",
                                "Three glycosyltransferase genes\u2014lgtA, lgtC, lgtD\u2014involved in LOS biosynthesis are phase-variable because of slipped-strand mispairing of homopolymeric poly-G tracts in their open reading frames; a fourth, lgtG, containing a poly-C tract is also phase variable. Expression of the 2C7 epitope requires lgtG to be phase-varied \u2018on\u2019; expression status of the three other lgt genes modulate binding of mAb 2C7 to LOS. As discussed above, the 2C7 LOS epitope is expressed almost universally in vivo and by minimally passaged isolates. The 2C7 epitope was identified in 64 of 68 (94%) gonococcal isolates examined directly in cervical secretions from women in a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Boston in the early 1990s and 96 of 101 (95%) of randomly chosen minimally (second-passage) isolates. Recently, it was reported that 100% of 75 minimally passaged isolates from China also expressed the 2C7 epitope. Importantly, mAb 2C7 was bactericidal (>50% killing) against each (100%) of the 62 isolates tested in complement-dependent bactericidal assays, including strains that expressed very low levels of the epitope. Because LOS is the most abundant outer membrane molecule on gonococci, expression of the 2C7 epitope on even a small fraction of LOS may permit binding of antibody at a density sufficient to engage the C1 complex and activate the classical pathway. It is speculated that widespread expression of this epitope results from gonococci's ability to sialylate lactose expressed from Hep II, which facilitates engagement of Siglec receptors. Many Siglec receptors signal through their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) tails to dampen host inflammatory responses that otherwise sense invading pathogens. Neu5Ac (sialic acid) that caps lactose from Hep II also inhibits complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface. Genetic deletion of lgtG markedly attenuates the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to colonize the vagina of estradiol-treated mice. Additional evidence for the importance of lgtG expression was provided by Lam and Gray-Owen, who showed that serial passage of N. gonorrhoeae in mice was accompanied by increased fitness of bacteria with each generation\u2014i.e., an increasing fraction of mice could be infected with bacteria recovered from each successive mouse passage. Intriguingly, there was a reproducible positive selection for gonococcal variants with lgtG \u2018on\u2019. Resistance to antibodies elicited by a \u20182C7 vaccine\u2019 would require lgtG to be turned completely \u2018off\u2019. Based on the accumulated evidence from: studies of minimally passaged isolates; bacteria examined directly ex vivo from humans (without passage on media) and studies in mice\u2014as discussed above, it is proposed that mutations in gonococci that eliminate 2C7 LOS epitope would render the organism less fit and avirulent. From a public health perspective, translation to a decrease in burden and duration of infection can have profound effects on disease pathology and transmission.

At the completion of assembly of the protected linear peptide sequence: H-Gly-Pro-(Ile-Pro-Val-Leu-Asp-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Phe-Ala-Pro)-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys-OH (SEQ ID NO: 7)-, bromoacetic acid was coupled to the N-terminus via symmetric anhydride coupling. The peptide Br-Ac-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Val-Leu-Asp-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Phe-Ala-Pro-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys-OH (SEQ ID NO: 7) was cleaved from the solid support and simultaneously de-protected using trifluoroacetic acid containing H2O and triisopropyl silane as cationic scavengers. The crude linear peptide was purified using preparative HPLC and subsequently cyclized by dilution into 1% Na2CO3 buffer to a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Cyclization was completed at 18 hour and the cyclic thioether peptide (structure indicated \u2018peptide mimic Core Peptide 2\u2019 in FIG. 1A) was purified via preparative RP-HPLC.

In order to synthesize a stable homogenous compound, potentially suitable for clinical use, several strategies were undertaken, further documented in Tables 1A-1H, Table 2, FIG. 9, FIG. 10 and FIG. 11). A final stable compound that circularized the mimitope via a stable non-reducible (covalent) thioether bond between the terminal cysteines in linear PEP1, formed the cyclized peptide (renamed monomeric Cyclic Peptide 2 [CP2]) that was linked to each of four lysines in a scaffold where\u2014NH2 groups on lysines, in turn, were linked to \u2014COOH groups on glutamate molecules in a core that formed the basis of the tetrameric CP2 structure (termed TMCP2) (FIG. 1A). The purity of TMCP2 determined by high-performance reverse-phase (RP-HPLC) separation showed a major peak (99% of the total area) at 13.155 min (FIG. 7).

                                "A candidate gonococcal peptide vaccine, which elicits bactericidal antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae, significantly reduces the duration and burden of gonococcal cervicovaginal colonization in BALB/c mice. Combining TMCP2 with the Th1-biased adjuvant GLA-SE evoked 2C7 epitope-specific IgG antibody responses after immunization with three intramuscular doses. Studies in mice also suggest that a Th1 response clears infection and induces a memory response (35), which lends support to using Th1-inducing adjuvants for gonococcal vaccines.",
                                "A limitation of an octameric peptide vaccine used in a previous study (13) was heterogeneity of the molecular mass of the preparation, likely the result of formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds. To circumvent this problem, a novel synthetic method in which each peptide subunit was first circularized with a covalent, non-reducible thioether bond was devised; each of the circularized subunits was then linked to a dendrimeric Glu backbone. Attempts to synthesize an octameric peptide using this method were technically challenging; instead, a tetrapeptide multiple antigenic peptide was synthesized for evaluation. The resulting compound, TMCP2, showed a single peak on mass spectroscopy. This relatively facile synthesis process yielded a compound of greater than 95% purity, which is suitable for scale-up and production of an inexpensive gonococcal vaccine candidate.",
                                "Activation of the classical pathway of complement requires engagement of the Cl complex (subunits of C1q, C1r and C1s), triggered by Fc antibody domains. Upon binding to surfaces, Fc domains of proximate IgG molecules form ordered hexamers through non-covalent interactions (29), which then simultaneously engage multiple globular heads of C1q, also a hexameric molecule. Multimeric interactions between globular domains of C1q and Fc convert otherwise low-affinity monomeric IgG Fc-C1q associations to interactions of high avidity, which permits autocatalysis of C1r and further complement activation. An effective bactericidal antibody requires a critical density of surface targets to engage C1q and permit complement activation. On a molar basis, LOS is the most abundant gonococcal outer membrane molecule and serves as a convenient target for binding of closely spaced antibody molecules whose Fc domains can then readily engage the C1 complex an activate complement. It has been shown that an intact complement system is necessary and sufficient for efficacy of passively administered bactericidal mAb 2C7\u2014given either systemically or intravaginally\u2014in the mouse vaginal colonization model (58). The importance of complement in host defenses against gonorrhea, is highlighted by the observation that both congenital and acquired defects of individual terminal components of complement are associated with an increased incidence of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) (30-33). Based the data with mAb 2C7, it is proposed that attenuation of colonization by antibodies elicited by TMCP2 vaccine also occurs via complement-dependent bactericidal antibody activity. A vaccine candidate that comprises gonococcal outer membrane vesicles plus microencapsulated IL-12 given intravaginally requires B cell activity, presumably to produce antibodies (34), however, a requirement for complement has not been shown.",
                                "Similar to the research findings, no other gonococcal vaccine candidates tested in the cervicovaginal colonization model in estradiol-treated mice show sterilizing immunity (34, 35, 36). Immunomodulatory effects of estrogen (37) may curb immune defenses that are important to clear N. gonorrhoeae. Seminal studies over 50 years ago (38) showed that the activity of terminal complement components in male mice exceeds, by 8- to 10-fold, activity in female mice. Administration of testosterone increases complement activity; estrogen has the opposite effect (39). Therefore, a vaccine antibody response that utilizes terminal complement to act in concert with the bactericidal action of antibody may also require waning of the suppressive effects of estrogen on terminal complement components before full bactericidal activity is restored.",
                                "A retrospective epidemiologic analysis showed that a detergent extracted meningococcal outer membrane vesicle (dOMV) vaccine called MeNZB designed and implemented in a widespread vaccination program to control an epidemic of group B meningococcal disease in New Zealand, showed diminished coverage in populations subsequently infected with N. gonorrhoeae\u2014calculated as 31% effectiveness of MenZB in decreasing gonococcal infection\u2014reduced to 14% in populations co-infected with N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia, a frequent clinical occurrence (40-42). Meningococci and gonococci share several similarities and it is possible that one or more proteins in MeNZB that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae may elicit protective immune responses. Individuals administered a licensed group B meningococcal vaccine, Bexsero\u00ae, which contains 5 recombinant meningococcal protein antigens in addition to the same dOMV that constitutes MeNZB (43), elicit antibodies, immunochemically, that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae (44). Antibodies elicited by immunizing mice with Bexsero\u00ae or MeNZB were reported to support bactericidal activity against N. gonorrhoeae (59). However, a separate study did not reveal bactericidal antibody activity against N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 in immune sera from individuals vaccinated with Bexsero\u00ae (28). How MeNZB provides protection against gonorrhea remains unclear; possible mechanisms may include reduction of adhesion of Ng to human cervical cells, as demonstrated with murine antibodies elicited by Bexsero\u00ae or MeNZB (59). Currently, several gonococcal vaccine candidates are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation (reviewed in Ref. (5)), some of which elicit bactericidal activity (45-47). Knowledge of the immune defenses responsible for clearing gonococcal infection is an important aspect of developing effective vaccines against this disease.",
                                "Three glycosyltransferase genes\u2014lgtA, lgtC, lgtD\u2014nvolved in LOS biosynthesis are phase-variable because of slipped-strand mispairing of homopolymeric poly-G tracts in their open reading frames (48, 49); a fourth, lgtG, containing a poly-C tract is also phase variable (12, 50-53). Expression of the 2C7 epitope requires lgtG to be phase-varied \u2018on\u2019; expression status of the three other lgt genes modulate binding of mAb 2C7 to LOS (11). As discussed above, the 2C7 LOS epitope is expressed almost universally in vivo and by minimally passaged isolates. The 2C7 epitope was identified in 64 of 68 (94%) gonococcal isolates examined directly in cervical secretions from women in a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Boston in the early 1990s and 96 of 101 (95%) of randomly chosen minimally (second-passage) isolates (7). Recently, it was reported that 100% of 75 minimally passaged isolates from China also expressed the 2C7 epitope (16). Importantly, mAb 2C7 was bactericidal (>50% killing) against each (100%) of the 62 isolates tested in complement-dependent bactericidal assays, including strains that expressed low levels of the epitope (13). Because LOS is the most abundant outer membrane molecule on gonococci, expression of the 2C7 epitope on even a small fraction of LOS may permit binding of antibody at a density sufficient to engage the C1 complex and activate the classical pathway. It is speculated that widespread expression of this epitope results from gonococci's ability to sialylate lactose expressed from HepII, which facilitates engagement of Siglec receptors (17). Many Siglec receptors signal through their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) tails (54) to dampen host inflammatory responses that otherwise sense invading pathogens (55, 56). Neu5Ac (sialic acid) that caps lactose from HepII also inhibits complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface (16). Genetic deletion of lgtG or lst (sialyltransferase) from a strain whose only site for sialylation is the terminal Gal of HepII lactose markedly attenuates the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to colonize the vagina of estradiol-treated mice (13, 16). Additional evidence for the importance of lgtG expression was provided by Lam and Gray-Owen, who showed that serial passage of N. gonorrhoeae in mice was accompanied by increased fitness of bacteria with each generation\u2014i.e., an increasing fraction of mice could be infected with bacteria recovered from each successive mouse passage. Intriguingly, there was a reproducible positive selection for gonococcal variants with lgtG \u2018on\u2019 (57). Resistance to antibodies elicited by a \u20182C7 vaccine\u2019 would require lgtG to be turned completely \u2018off\u2019. Based on the accumulated evidence from: studies of minimally passaged isolates; bacteria examined directly ex vivo from humans (without passage on media) and studies in mice\u2014as discussed above, it is proposed that mutations in gonococci that eliminate 2C7 LOS epitope would render the organism less fit and avirulent. From a public health perspective, translation to a decrease in burden and duration of infection can have profound effects on disease pathology and transmission. In conclusion, TMCP2 represents an important step forward in the development of a safe, economical and effective gonococcal vaccine, or subcomponent thereof.",

The reactive N-hydrosuccinimide (NHS) at the N-terminus was displaced and PEP1-MAL-PEG4 molecules were amide-linked to each of 8 Lys residues of a Poly-Lys backbone. Polyethylene glycol (PEG4) was included to ensure a water-soluble product.

Mod 3, the most antigenic, was used to make 4 different Tetra-MAP derivatives (Tetra MAP 3.1 [11], TetraMAP 3.2 [12], TetraMAP 3.3 [13] and TetraMAP 3.4 [14]) (Table 1E) each of which, used singly, was poorly immunogenic in BALB/c mice (FIG. 18; TetraMAP 1.1 [3] and TetraMAP 1.2 [4] were also tested for immunogenicity). Two linear concatemers of Mod 3, containing 2 copies of the nominal peptide using different length spacers were also non-immunogenic (Table 1H, [15] and [16]).",

One of the preparations, Tetra-MAP Cyclic Peptide 2 (TMCP2) [22], was modified at the N-terminus of the monomeric peptide (PEP1) so a stable non-reducible (covalent) thioether bond formed a cyclized peptide with the C-terminal Cys of the peptide (Table 1H). The two other peptides, TMCP3 [23] and TMCP4, [24] each contained internal disulfide bonds when cyclized leading, potentially, to the formation of heterogenous molecules (Table 1H). TMCP3 bound best to mAb 2C7 as determined by inhibition ELISA (FIG. 9). TMCP2 and TMCP3 yielded higher anti-LOS titers than TMCP4 in immunization experiments that used the tetrapeptides plus Sigma MPL adjuvant (FIG. 10). Anti-TMCP2 antisera showed maximal complement-dependent bactericidal activity against N. gonorrhoeae strain 15253 in immunized mice (FIG. 11) and was chosen for further development. It is worth noting that affinity of binding to mAb 2C7 did not correlate with the functional antibody response. In light of its stability and performance in functional studies, TMCP2 was chosen as the lead candidate and was characterized further.",
