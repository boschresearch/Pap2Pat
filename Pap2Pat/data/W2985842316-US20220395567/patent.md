# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

The sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhea, is a commonly reported communicable disease and poses a worldwide risk. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) which is a gram-negative diplococcus. Although N. gonorrhoeae primarily infects mucous membranes, it is capable of invading tissues and evading host defenses. N. gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of a spectrum of sequelae. These sequelae range from asymptomatic mucosal infections to significant disease syndromes in both sexes, for example, disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) in men and women, as well as salpingitis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women. Other sequelae include, recurrent infection, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, pelvic adhesions and other lasting inflammatory effects.

N. gonorrhoeae has multiple virulence factors. The surface components of this pathogen play an important role in attaching to and invading host cells, while providing potential targets for the host immune response. Gonococcal infections elicit local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses to several components which are exhibited as surface exposed antigens of the bacterium, particularly pili, porin (Por) or protein I (PI), opacity associated proteins (Opas) or protein Hs, Rmp or protein III, and lipooligosaccharides (LOS). Pili, Opa, Por, and LOS are all implicated in attachment to and invasion of the host and all display considerable variation on their surface exposed regions.

In both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, gonococcal infections have been shown to stimulate increased levels of anti-gonococcal serum immunoglobulins. The peripheral humoral response is predominately IgG (mostly subclass IgG3), with lesser amounts of IgM and IgA. Quantitatively, the antibody response is primarily directed against the pili, Opa proteins, and LOS. Local antibodies are present in genital secretions, but in reduced amounts, and may be directed against different antigenic targets than those in serum. The predominant class of antibodies present in secretions is also IgG (mostly IgG3) and not secretory IgA (sigA). Antibodies against LOS are present as well, but in lesser amounts than those against pili, Por, and Opa. Although patients infected with N. gonorrhoeae may show an antibody response to many gonococcal antigens, N. gonorrhoeae isolated from patients with disseminated infection (DGI) are resistant to the bactericidal action of normal human serum (NHS) and of most convalescent sera. This serum-resistant phenotype, termed stable serum resistance (SR), may enable the organism to evade local defenses, penetrate mucosal barriers and disseminate via the bloodstream.

Attempts to use individual surface components of the pathogen as targets for conventional vaccines have been unsuccessful because of their antigenic variability. Pilus vaccines have been protective only against infection with the homologous strain (used to make the pilus vaccine) and Por vaccination has been unsuccessful even in human experimental challenge. In addition, N. gonorrhoeae express marked phenotypic heterogeneity, typically shifting from one antigenic form to another at a frequency of >1 in 103 organisms making the surface of this organism a moving target for most vaccine strategies. Although the vaccine candidates have provoked antibody responses, the antibodies and immune responses produced have not been broadly protective.

## SUMMARY

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae), the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, has become resistant to almost every antibiotic in clinical use. Currently, the combination of the antibiotics ceftriaxone and azithromycin is the first-line of treatment for gonorrhea recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, resistance to each of these antibiotics has been reported in several countries, which further limits treatment options. In addition, the number of cases of gonorrhea is increasing rapidly. In 2017, 555,608 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC, a 67% increase in the number of cases in five years (www.cdc.gov/std/statsl7/Gonorrhea.htm). Therefore, there is an urgent need for safe and effective vaccines against gonorrhea to prevent the global spread of multidrug-resistant organisms.

An increased binding affinity corresponds to a decreased KD. Higher affinity binding of an antibody to a first target relative to a second target can be indicated by a higher KA (or a smaller numerical value KD) for binding the first target than the KA (or numerical value KD) for binding the second target. In such cases, the antibody has specificity for the first target relative to the second target. Differences in binding affinity (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be greater than 1, for example at least 1.1; 1.5; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 15; 20; 37.5; 50; 70; 80; 91; 100; 500; 1,000; 10,000, 100,000 fold, or more.

For example, in some embodiments, an effective amount of a peptide mimic may refer to the amount of the peptide mimic that is sufficient to treat a disorder (e.g., N. gonorrhoeae). In some embodiments, an effective amount of a peptide mimic provided herein, may refer to the amount of the peptide mimic that is sufficient to induce a therapeutic effect. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the effective amount of an agent (e.g., peptide mimic), may vary depending on various factors as, for example, on the subject to be treated (e.g., age, gender, severity of infection) or on the concentration and route of administration of the agent being used.

The term “linker,” as used herein, refers to a chemical moiety linking two molecules or moieties (e.g., components of a peptide mimic as disclosed herein). Typically, the linker is positioned between, or flanked by, two groups, molecules, or other moieties and connected to each one via a covalent bond, thus connecting the two, however a linker may connect to ends of a molecule (e.g., nucleic acid, peptidyl sequence, peptide). In some embodiments, the linker comprises an amino acid or a plurality of amino acids (e.g., a peptide or protein). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a nucleotide (e.g., DNA or RNA) or a plurality of nucleotides (e.g., a nucleic acid). In some embodiments, the linker is an organic molecule, functional group, group, polymer, or other chemical moiety. In some embodiments, the linker is a cleavable linker, e.g., the linker comprises a bond that can be cleaved upon exposure to, for example, UV light or a hydrolytic enzyme, such as a protease or esterase. In some embodiments, the linker is any stretch of amino acids having at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, or more amino acids (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 amino acids). In other embodiments, the linker is a chemical bond (e.g., a covalent bond, amide bond, disulfide bond, ester bond, carbon-carbon bond, carbon heteroatom bond).

As used herein, “monoclonal antibodies” are monospecific antibodies produced initially by a single clone of antibody forming cells.

As used herein a “peptide mimic” refers to a peptide which presents in a similar manner and which has a profile similar to that of an epitope, of which it is a mimic. By presenting and having a profile similar to that of an epitope, a peptide mimic may elicit an immunological response in a similar fashion as the epitope of which it mimics.

A “leaving group” (LG) is an art-understood term referring to an atomic or molecular fragment that departs with a pair of electrons in heterolytic bond cleavage, wherein the molecular fragment is an anion or neutral molecule. As used herein, a leaving group can be an atom or a group capable of being displaced by a nucleophile. See e.g., Smith, March Advanced Organic Chemistry 6th ed. (501-502). Exemplary leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halo (e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo) and activated substituted hydroxyl groups (e.g., —OC(═O)SRaa, —OC(═O)Raa, —OCO2Raa, —OC(═O)N(Rbb)2, OC(═NRbb)Raa, OC(═NRbb)ORaa, OC(═NRbb)N(Rbb)2, —OS (═O)Raa, —OSO2Raa, —OP(Rcc)2, —OP(Rcc)3, —OP(═O)2Raa, —OP(═O)(Raa)2, —OP(═O)(ORcc)2, OP(═O)2N(Rbb)2, and —OP(═O)(NRbb)2, wherein Raa, Rbb, and Rcc are as defined herein). Additional examples of suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, alkanesulfonyloxy, arenesulfonyloxy, alkyl-carbonyloxy (e.g., acetoxy), arylcarbonyloxy, aryloxy, methoxy, N,O-dimethylhydroxylamino, pixyl, and haloformates.

In some embodiments, the leaving group is a brosylate, such as p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy. In some embodiments, the leaving group is a nosylate, such as 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy. In some embodiments, the leaving group is a sulfonate-containing group. In some embodiments, the leaving group is a tosylate group. In some embodiments, the leaving group is a phosphineoxide (e.g., formed during a Mitsunobu reaction) or an internal leaving group such as an epoxide or cyclic sulfate. Other non-limiting examples of leaving groups are water, ammonia, alcohols, ether moieties, thioether moieties, zinc halides, magnesium moieties, diazonium salts, and copper moieties.

In general, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen present on a group is replaced with a permissible substituent, e.g., a substituent which upon substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, or other reaction. Unless otherwise indicated, a “substituted” group has a substituent at one or more substitutable positions of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure is substituted, the substituent is either the same or different at each position. The term “substituted” is contemplated to include substitution with all permissible substituents of organic compounds, and includes any of the substituents described herein that results in the formation of a stable compound. The present invention contemplates any and all such combinations in order to arrive at a stable compound. For purposes of this invention, heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any suitable substituent as described herein which satisfy the valencies of the heteroatoms and results in the formation of a stable moiety. The invention is not limited in any manner by the exemplary substituents described herein.

The terms “protein,” “peptide,” “peptidyl sequence,” and “polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a polymer of amino acid residues linked together by peptide (amide) bonds. The terms refer to a protein, peptide, or polypeptide of any size, structure, or function. Typically, a protein, peptide, or polypeptide will be at least three amino acids long. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may refer to an individual protein or a collection of proteins. One or more of the amino acids in a protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be modified, for example, by the addition of a chemical entity such as a carbohydrate group, a hydroxyl group, a phosphate group, a farnesyl group, an isofarnesyl group, a fatty acid group, a linker for conjugation, functionalization, or other modification, etc. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may also be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide may be just a fragment of a naturally occurring protein or peptide. A protein, peptide, or polypeptide (e.g., peptide mimic) may be naturally occurring, recombinant, or synthetic, or any combination thereof. Any of the proteins provided herein may be produced by any method known in the art. For example, the proteins provided herein may be produced via recombinant protein expression and purification, which is especially suited for fusion proteins comprising a peptide linker. Methods for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known, and include those described by Green and Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (4th ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2012)), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The terms “percent identity,” “sequence identity,” “% identity,” “% sequence identity,” and “% identical,” as they may be interchangeably used herein, refer to a quantitative measurement of the similarity between two sequences (e.g., nucleic acid or amino acid). The percent identity of genomic DNA sequence, intron and exon sequence, and amino acid sequence between humans and other species varies by species type, with chimpanzee having the highest percent identity with humans of all species in each category.

Calculation of the percent identity of two nucleic acid sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and second nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non- identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.

The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using methods such as those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 1989, 4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can, alternatively, be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using an NWSgapdna.CMP matrix. Methods commonly employed to determine percent identity between sequences include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988); incorporated herein by reference. Techniques for determining identity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Exemplary computer software to determine homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG program package, Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 12(1), 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA Atschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215, 403 (1990)).

When a percent identity is stated, or a range thereof (e.g., at least, more than, etc.), unless otherwise specified, the endpoints shall be inclusive and the range (e.g., at least 70% identity) shall include all ranges within the cited range (e.g., at least 71%, at least 72%, at least 73%, at least 74%, at least 75%, at least 76%, at least 77%, at least 78%, at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 95.5%,at least 96%, at least 96.5%,at least 97%, at least 97.5%,at least 98%, at least 98.5%,at least 99%, at least 99.5%, at least 99.6%, at least 99.7%, at least 99.8%, at least 99.9% identity) and all increments thereof (e.g., tenths of a percent (e.g., 0.1%), hundredths of a percent (e.g., 0.01%), etc.).

The term “polymorph” refers to a crystalline form of a compound (or a salt, hydrate, or solvate thereof). All polymorphs have the same elemental composition. Different crystalline forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Various polymorphs of a compound can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.

### CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS

LOS is an important virulence determinant of N. gonorrhoeae. Considerable evidence supports the role of LOS as a major target of bactericidal antibody directed to the surface of N. gonorrhoeae. Antibodies to LOS have several important functions: bactericidal activity; complement activation through the classical or alternative complement pathways; and opsonic activity. Additionally, LOS has been shown to be the most effective gonococcal antigen to induce a functional antibody response to homologous and heterologous gonococci.

The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C7, detects a LOS derived oligosaccharide (OS) epitope that appears to be widely conserved and expressed amongst clinical isolates of gonococci. Typically, saccharides are T-cell independent antigens. When administered alone as immunogens, they generally elicit only a primary antibody response. In addition, oligosaccharides are small (<10 saccharide units), and would likely require additional biochemical derivatization to render them immunogenic. The use of such oligosaccharides as vaccine candidates, therefore, is limited in several respects.

The instant disclosure generally solves the problems referred to above by providing peptide mimics of widely conserved oligosaccharide epitopes of N. gonorrhoeae which are not present in human blood group antigens. Such peptide mimics elicit bactericidal antibody responses against a conserved oligosaccharide epitope of N. gonorrhoeae to significantly reduce the duration and burden of gonococcal cervico-vaginal colonization and methods of use. Such peptide mimics can be used as described herein as well as according to methods described in the art, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,476,784 and 6,099,839 (both incorporated herein by reference), as a surrogate antigen to elicit a T cell-dependent immune response against an oligosaccharide epitope of N. gonorrhoeae. 


- Peptide Mimics

The instant disclosure is directed to peptide mimics that immune-specifically (e.g., reacts, binds, or generates an immune reaction to a specific antigen or molecule) react with an antibody directed to a conserved oligosaccharide epitope of N. gonorrhoeae, which oligosaccharide epitope is not present in human blood group antigens. Such peptide mimics can be used in a manner similar to the anti-idiotypic antibodies described, as a surrogate antigen to elicit a T cell-dependent immune response against an oligosaccharide epitope of N. gonorrhoeae. The peptide mimic may be administered to uninfected subjects to induce a specific immune response directed against gonococcal organisms or cells bearing said oligosaccharide antigen. Such an immune response can be immune-prophylactic (e.g., eliciting an immune response or priming the immune system to respond in the event of an exposure) in character, in that it would prevent, and/or reduce the severity of, an infection should the recipient be exposed to the gonococcal organism or cells bearing said oligosaccharide antigen.

**EXAMPLES**

Activation of the classical pathway of complement requires engagement of the C1 complex (subunits of C1q, C1r, and C1s), triggered by Fc antibody domains. Upon binding to surfaces, Fc domains of proximate IgG molecules form ordered hexamers through non-covalent interactions, which then simultaneously engage multiple globular heads of C1q, also a hexameric molecule. Multimeric interactions between globular domains of C1q and Fc convert otherwise low-affinity monomeric IgG Fc-C1q associations to interactions of high avidity, which permits autocatalysis of C1r and further complement activation. An effective bactericidal antibody requires a critical density of surface targets to engage C1q and permit complement activation. On a molar basis, LOS is the most abundant gonococcal outer membrane molecule and serves as a convenient target for binding of closely spaced antibody molecules whose Fc domains can then readily engage the Cl complex an activate complement. An intact complement pathway is necessary and sufficient for efficacy of mAb 2C7 in the mouse vaginal colonization model (Gulati S et al. PLoS Biol. 2019 Jun 19;17(6):e3000323. PMID:). The importance of complement in host defenses against gonorrhea, is highlighted by the observation that both congenital and acquired defects of individual terminal components of complement are associated with an increased incidence of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). Based on the data with mAb 2C7, it is proposed that attenuation of colonization by antibodies elicited by TMCP2 vaccine also occurs via complement-dependent bactericidal antibody activity. A vaccine candidate that comprises gonococcal outer membrane vesicles plus microencapsulated IL-12 given intravaginally requires B cell activity, presumably to produce antibodies, however, a requirement for complement has not been shown.

No other gonococcal vaccine candidates tested in the cervico-vaginal colonization model in estradiol-treated mice show sterilizing immunity. Immunomodulatory effects of estrogen may curb immune defenses that are important to clear N. gonorrhoeae. Seminal studies showed that the activity of terminal complement components in male mice exceeds, by 8-to 10-fold, activity in female mice. Administration of testosterone increases complement activity; estrogen has the opposite effect. Therefore, a vaccine antibody response that utilizes terminal complement to act in concert with the bactericidal action of antibody may also require waning of the suppressive effects of estrogen on terminal complement components before full bactericidal activity is restored.

A retrospective epidemiologic analysis showed that a detergent extracted meningococcal outer membrane vesicle (dOMV) vaccine called MeNZB designed and implemented in a widespread vaccination program to control an epidemic of group B meningococcal disease in New Zealand, showed diminished coverage in populations subsequently infected with N. gonorrhoeae—calculated as 31% effectiveness of MenZB in decreasing gonococcal infection—reduced to 14% in populations co-infected with N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia, a frequent clinical occurrence. Meningococci and gonococci share several similarities and it is possible that one or more proteins in MeNZB that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae may elicit protective immune responses. Subjects administered a licensed group B meningococcal vaccine, BEXSERO®, which contains 5 recombinant meningococcal protein antigens in addition to the same dOMV that constitutes MeNZB, elicit antibodies, immunochemically, that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae. However, in a separate study, bactericidal antibody activity against N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 in immune sera from subjects vaccinated with BEXSERO® was not observed. How MeNZB provides protection against gonorrhea remains unclear. Currently, several gonococcal vaccine candidates are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation, some of which elicit bactericidal activity. Knowledge of the immune defenses responsible for clearing gonococcal infection is an important aspect of developing effective vaccines against this disease.

Three glycosyltransferase genes—lgtA, lgtC, lgtD—involved in LOS biosynthesis are phase-variable because of slipped-strand mispairing of homopolymeric poly-G tracts in their open reading frames; a fourth, lgtG, containing a poly-C tract is also phase variable. Expression of the 2C7 epitope requires lgtG to be phase-varied ‘on’; expression status of the three other lgt genes modulate binding of mAb 2C7 to LOS. As discussed above, the 2C7 LOS epitope is expressed almost universally in vivo and by minimally passaged isolates. The 2C7 epitope was identified in 64 of 68 (94%) gonococcal isolates examined directly in cervical secretions from women in a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Boston in the early 1990s and 96 of 101 (95%) of randomly chosen minimally (second-passage) isolates. Recently, it was reported that 100% of 75 minimally passaged isolates from China also expressed the 2C7 epitope. Importantly, mAb 2C7 was bactericidal (>50% killing) against each (100%) of the 62 isolates tested in complement-dependent bactericidal assays, including strains that expressed very low levels of the epitope. Because LOS is the most abundant outer membrane molecule on gonococci, expression of the 2C7 epitope on even a small fraction of LOS may permit binding of antibody at a density sufficient to engage the C1 complex and activate the classical pathway. It is speculated that widespread expression of this epitope results from gonococci's ability to sialylate lactose expressed from Hep II, which facilitates engagement of Siglec receptors. Many Siglec receptors signal through their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) tails to dampen host inflammatory responses that otherwise sense invading pathogens. Neu5Ac (sialic acid) that caps lactose from Hep II also inhibits complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface. Genetic deletion of lgtG markedly attenuates the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to colonize the vagina of estradiol-treated mice. Additional evidence for the importance of lgtG expression was provided by Lam and Gray-Owen, who showed that serial passage of N. gonorrhoeae in mice was accompanied by increased fitness of bacteria with each generation—i.e., an increasing fraction of mice could be infected with bacteria recovered from each successive mouse passage. Intriguingly, there was a reproducible positive selection for gonococcal variants with lgtG ‘on’. Resistance to antibodies elicited by a ‘2C7 vaccine’ would require lgtG to be turned completely ‘off’. Based on the accumulated evidence from: studies of minimally passaged isolates; bacteria examined directly ex vivo from humans (without passage on media) and studies in mice—as discussed above, it is proposed that mutations in gonococci that eliminate 2C7 LOS epitope would render the organism less fit and avirulent. From a public health perspective, translation to a decrease in burden and duration of infection can have profound effects on disease pathology and transmission. In conclusion, TMCP2 represents an important step forward in the development of a safe, economical and effective gonococcal vaccine, or subcomponent thereof.

In order that this disclosure may be better understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure in any manner.

**Example 1: Peptide Mimics Elicit Immunogenic Response**

**Bacterial Strains**

N. gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 (Opa+, Pil+) (20), MS11 (Opa+, Pil+) (21), 15253 (22) and 15253 ΔlgtG (isogenic mutant of 15253 with lgtG deleted; does not react with mAb 2C7) (16).

**Purification of LOS**

LOS was purified from strains 15253 and 15253 ΔlgtG using the hot water phenol extraction method (23).

**Materials for Production of TMCP-2**

The peptide mimic (also referred to herein as TMCP2) was synthesized using a solid phase approach for the thioether peptide component and a classical solution phase method for production of the reverse peptide mimic core and final tetra peptide mimic construct. Briefly, the thioether monomer was synthesized on a Fmoc-Lys-Wang resin using standard Fmoc-tBu amino acid derivatives. At the completion of assembly of the protected linear peptide sequence: H-Gly-Pro-(Ile-Pro-Val-Leu-Asp-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Phe-Ala-Pro)-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys-OH (SEQ ID NO: 7)-, bromoacetic acid was coupled to the N-terminus via symmetric anhydride coupling. The peptide Br-Ac-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Val-Leu-Asp-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Phe-Ala-Pro-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys-OH (SEQ ID NO: 7) was cleaved from the solid support and simultaneously de-protected using trifluoroacetic acid containing H2O and triisopropyl silane as cationic scavengers. The crude linear peptide was purified using preparative HPLC and subsequently cyclized by dilution into 1% Na2CO3 buffer to a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Cyclization was completed at 18 hour and the cyclic thioether peptide (structure indicated ‘peptide mimic Core Peptide 2’ in FIG. 1A) was purified via preparative RP-HPLC. Fractions which had a purity of >90% by analytical HPLC were pooled and lyophilized. The cyclic thioether monomer peptide was characterized using ESI-MS (calculated m/z=1864.17; found m/z=1864.88).

The reverse peptide mimic core construct was synthesized starting with Ac-β-Ala-OH. H-Glu(OBzl)2was coupled to the Ac-β-Ala-OH using diphenylphosphoryl azide. The benzyl groups were liberated via catalytic hydrogenation. Ac-β-Ala-Glu-OH was subsequently reacted with 2 equivalents of H-Glu(OBzl)2. The benzyl groups were removed again via catalytic hydrogenation. The final reverse tetra peptide mimic core peptide Ac-β-Ala-Glu[Glu-OH]2 (‘Reverse peptide mimic Core’ in FIG. 1A) was isolated and characterized by ESI MS: calculated m/z=519.19; found m/z=519.22. This compound was subsequently activated to the tetra NHS ester in the presence of diisopropyl carbodiimide.

TCMP-2 was synthesized by adding 4.2 equivalents of the cyclic thioether peptide mimic Core Peptide 2 to the Reverse peptide mimic Core (Ac-β-Ala-Glu[Glu(OSu)2]2). Following coupling for 20 hours, the crude peptide tetra peptide mimic TMCP-2 was isolated by preparative RP-HPLC. The resulting fractions with a purity >95% were pooled and lyophilized. The final product TCMP-2 was isolated and characterized by ESI-MS (resulting TMCP-2 structure shown in FIG. 1A). FIG. 6 shows a summary of the synthesis procedure.

**Immunization of Mice**

Six week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with TMCP2 (dose specified for each experiment) and GLA-SE (5 μg) as the adjuvant. Control mice received GLA-SE adjuvant alone. Sera were collected two weeks after each immunization.

**ELISA to Measure Anti-LOS Antibody Levels**

Microtiter wells were coated with LOS purified from 15253 or 15253 ΔlgtG (80 μg/ml) in PBS as described previously. Serial dilutions of immune sera were dispensed into wells and bound anti-LOS Ab was disclosed with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. A standard curve for mouse IgG was generated by coating wells with anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and pure mouse IgG (Sigma) also as described previously.

**Inhibition ELISA**

In order to compare antigenicity of peptide mimic Core Peptide 2 (monomeric cyclic CP2) and composite TMCP2 compounds with LOS that expresses the 2C7 epitope, inhibition ELISA was performed using mAb 2C7 reacted with the individual compounds to assess inhibition of binding (residual binding) of mAb to LOS by each compound. Microtiter wells were coated with LOS (80 μg/ml in PBS) purified from strain FA1090. Wells were washed and blocked with PBS-0.05% Tween 20. mAb 2C7 (0.04 μg/ml) either alone or containing monomeric cyclic peptide CP2 (1.07 to 1070 μM) or composite TMCP2 (concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 μM) was dispended into LOS coated wells. Residual binding of 2C7 mAb was measured with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Bound IgG was quantitated using a mouse IgG standard curve and percent inhibition determined compared to reaction mixtures that contained LOS (full inhibition).

**Depletion of Mouse IgM**

Because earlier it was observed that sera from naïve and mice given adjuvant alone manifest bactericidal activity mediated by IgM, mouse IgM was depleted from all sera collected as part of immunization studies. Sera from mice diluted 1:1 in PBS was mixed with anti-mouse IgM agarose (Sigma; binding capacity >0.4 mg/ml) (1 volume of packed agarose to 1 volume of serum diluted 1:1) in a 2.0 ml microspin filter column (Costar) with a pore size of 0.22 μM) for 15 min at 22 ° C. Filter-sterilized IgM depleted sera were collected by centrifugation of the mixture at 1000 g for 2 min and heat-inactivated (56 ° C. for 30 min) to eliminate intrinsic complement activity in mouse serum prior to use in serum bactericidal assays where human complement was substituted.

**Serum Bactericidal Assays**

Serum bactericidal assays were performed. Bacteria that had been harvested from an overnight culture on chocolate agar plates were repassaged onto fresh chocolate agar and allowed to grow for 6 h at 37° C. in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Bacteria were then suspended in HBSS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.15 mM CaCl2 (HBSS++) for use in serum bactericidal assays. Briefly, about 2000 colony forming units (CFUs) of N. gonorrhoeae FA090 were incubated with serial dilutions of immune mouse sera (heat-inactivated and IgM-depleted) in the presence or absence of 20% normal human serum (NHS) as a source of human complement. Serum bactericidal assays with strain MS11 were performed with IgG and IgM depleted NHS (Human complement; Pel-Freez) because this strain is susceptible to killing by NHS. Final volumes of bactericidal reaction mixtures were 150 μl. Aliquots of 25-μl reaction mixtures were plated onto chocolate agar in duplicate at the beginning of the assay (to) and again after incubation at 37° C. for 30 min (t30). Survival was calculated as the number of viable colonies at t30 relative to t0.

**Mouse Protection Experiments**

Use of animals in this study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The BALB/c mouse model of vaginal colonization described by Jerse was used (25). Two weeks after the last immunization, mice in the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle were started on treatment (that day) with 0.1 mg PREMARIN® (Pfizer; a mixture of sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate also containing sodium sulfate conjugates of 17a-dihydroequilin, 17a-estradiol and 17β-dihydroequilin) in 200 μl of water, given subcutaneously on each of three days; —2, 0 and +2 days (before, the day of and after gonococcal inoculation) to prolong the estrus phase of the reproductive cycle and promote susceptibility to N. gonorrhoeae infection. Antibiotics (vancomycin and streptomycin) ineffective against N. gonorrhoeae were also used to reduce competitive microflora (26). Mice were infected on Day 0 with either strain FA1090 or MS11 (inoculum specified for each experiment). Vaginas were swabbed daily to enumerate gonococcal CFU.

**Statistical Analyses**

Experiments that compared clearance of N. gonorrhoeae in independent groups of mice estimated and tested three characteristics of the data (13): 1) time to clearance; 2) longitudinal trends in mean logio CFU; 3) and the cumulative CFU as area under the curve (AUC). Statistical analyses were performed using mice that initially yielded bacterial colonies on Days 1 and/or 2. Median time to clearance was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves; times to clearance were compared between groups using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Mean logio CFU trends over time were compared between groups using a linear mixed model with mouse as the random effect using both a random intercept and a random slope. A quadratic or cubic function in time was determined to provide the best fit; random slopes were linear in time. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare nested models (with and without the interaction term of group and time) to test whether the trend differed over time between the two groups. The mean AUC (logio CFU versus time) was computed for each mouse to estimate the bacterial burden over time (cumulative infection); the means under the curves were compared between groups using the nonparametric two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test because distributions were skewed or kurtotic. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test was also applied to compare more than two groups in an experiment.

**Characterization of TMCP2**

Initial synthesis of the multivalent antigenic peptide (Octa-MAP) as a vaccine candidate that encompassed 8 copies of the mimitope of the 2C7 epitope (termed PEP1) onto a lysine core (13), yielded a heterogeneous compound because of reversible disulfide bonding between the terminally located Cys residues on PEP1 Internal bonding within the same molecule and externally to other like molecules resulted in a pattern of extreme MW heterogeneity (Table 1A and FIG. 15). In order to synthesize a stable homogenous compound, potentially suitable for clinical use, several strategies were undertaken, further documented in Tables 1A-1H, Table 2, FIG. 9, FIG. 10 and FIG. 11). A final stable compound that circularized the mimitope via a stable non-reducible (covalent) thioether bond between the terminal cysteines in linear PEP1, formed the cyclized peptide (renamed monomeric Cyclic Peptide 2 [CP2]) that was linked to each of four lysines in a scaffold where—NH2 groups on lysines, in turn, were linked to —COOH groups on glutamate molecules in a core that formed the basis of the tetrameric CP2 structure (termed TMCP2) (FIG. 1A). The purity of TMCP2 determined by high-performance reverse-phase (RP-HPLC) separation showed a major peak (99% of the total area) at 13.155 min (FIG. 7). The identity of TMCP2 was verified with positive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS ES+) (FIG. 8) that showed multicharged ions at M+4 (m/z=1976.62), M+5 (m/z=1581.68), and M+6 (m/z=1318.56). The TMCP2 tetra MAP peptide was highly homogeneous as determined by RP-HPLC; ESI-MS supporting the validity of this conclusion.

Attempts to measure mAb 2C7 (7) binding directly to immobilized peptide mimic Core Peptide 2 (abbreviated CP2 in FIG. 1A) and composite TMCP2 by ELISA were not successful. The possibility of poor capture of the peptides by the microtiter wells was considered and therefore used an ELISA to measure inhibition of binding (residual binding) of mAb 2C7 to immobilized gonococcal LOS that had been reacted with increasing concentrations of the peptides (FIG. 1B). 50% inhibition of mAb 2C7 binding to immobilized 15253 LOS in the presence of 25 μM and 107 μM of TMCP2 and CP2, respectively, was observed; the —4-fold lower molar concentration of TMCP2 (compared to CP2) required to achieve 50% inhibition is consistent with its tetrameric nature; overall higher avidity and maintenance of the 4:1 molar ratio in binding experiments ensured that linking CP2 to the ‘peptide mimic’ Core did not alter antigenicity of the final compound. Purified LOS, used as a positive control, completely inhibited mAb 2C7 binding to immobilized LOS even at the lowest concentration (0.178 μM) tested.

**Choice of Lead Adjuvant**

TMCP2 was tested with three additional adjuvants with properties similar to Sigma MPL: (i) Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) in a stable oil-in-water nanoemulsion (SE) (GLA-SE); (ii) GLA-Liposome QS21 (GLA-LSQ; QS-21 is a water-soluble extract of the Quillaja saponaria [soap bark] tree) and (iii) GLA-Aqueous formulation (GLA-AF) (FIGS. 12A-12B). Sigma MPL adjuvant was a control. Alum (Alhydrogel) and the stable oil-in-water nanoemulsion (SE) were also tested. GLA-SE and GLA-SQ yielded the highest anti-LOS IgG titers, similar to those elicited by Sigma MPL; GLA-AF gave intermediate titers, while Alum and SE yielded low titers (FIG. 12A).

In light of the importance of complement-dependent killing for the activity of mAb 2C7 in vivo (58), serum bactericidal assays were performed to assess functionality of immune antibodies. During the course of the antigen optimization and adjuvant selection studies (performed between mid-2016 and early-2018), heat-inactivated (56° C. for 30 min) mouse sera (used to deplete endogenous complement) from naïve mice or mice given adjuvant alone (control mice sera) supported complement-dependent bactericidal activity against strain FA1090 when normal human serum (NHS) was added as the source of complement; FA1090 is highly resistant to the bactericidal action of NHS alone (27). Control mouse sera plus heat-inactivated (56° C. for 30 min) NHS failed to kill gonococci, suggesting that observed killing was complement dependent. A systematic analysis of the bactericidal activity of heat-inactivated sera with added NHS from several strains of naïve mice from different sources was carried out (Table 3). Except for Rag-/- and JhD mice that both lack antibody, heat-inactivated sera from all other mice tested supported human complement-dependent killing of N. gonorrhoeae. Similarly, bactericidal activity was supported by sera from CD1 mice housed at the Childrens Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, Calif. given Alum adjuvant (28).

Absorption of naïve or adjuvant control mouse sera against anti-mouse IgM-linked agarose, but not protein A/G agarose (depletes IgG), abrogated bactericidal activity (survival >80%), revealing IgM as the antibody subclass responsible for the underlying bactericidal activity. Mouse sera used in (human) complement-dependent bactericidal assays in adjuvant selection studies was depleted of IgM. Anti-LOS IgG levels in 5 immune sera before and after passage through anti-mouse IgM agarose were measured, and it was noted that absorption resulted in a mean decrease in IgG concentration of 13.6% (range 9.2-18.5%).

Serum bactericidal assays with IgM-depleted immune and adjuvant control sera performed using normal human serum (NHS) as the source of complement (FIG. 12B) showed that killing of gonococci mirrored anti-LOS IgG titers. Based on these data, GLA-SE was chosen as the lead adjuvant because it has received approval for human use.

Immunogenicity and Bactericidal Activity of Anti-sera from Mice Immunized with TMCP2 and GLA-30 SE Adjuvant

Immunization (initial inoculation plus boosting at 3 and 6 weeks [3 doses]) of mice with 50 μg (5 mice), 100 μg (5 mice), or 200 μg (4 mice) of TMCP2 combined with GLA-SE adjuvant. Immunization elicited anti-LOS IgG responses, measured two weeks after final boosting, that exceeded 2 μg/ml in every mouse (FIG. 2A). Responses in 3 of 5 mice given the 50 μg dose exceeded 10 μg/ml. The reasons for these high responses are not clear. Mice immunized with GLA-SE alone did not elicit detectable IgG responses against LOS. Specificity was demonstrated by non-reactivity of any of the sera with 15253 ΔlgtG LOS.

The ‘natural’ bactericidal IgM antibodies noted in naïve mice or mice given adjuvants alone seen in the adjuvant selection studies were not observed in subsequent experiments (performed after June 2018). Intact immune sera taken two weeks after the last immunization were tested for bactericidal activity against strain FA1090 (FIG. 2B; numerical data are shown in Table 3). All immune sera showed >50% killing when tested at a final dilution of 1:6 (immune serum concentration of 16.7%). Four of 5, 3 of 5, and 3 of 4 immune sera in the 50, 100, and 200 μg/dose groups, respectively, showed <50% survival (>50% killing) when immune serum was tested a concentration of 3.3% (1:30 dilution). Mice that received GLA-SE alone did not show IgG responses against LOS and did not support complement-dependent bactericidal activity of FA1090 (Table 4). Depleting IgM in these sera did not reduce bactericidal activity significantly (increase survival), indicating that IgG was responsible for the bactericidal activity in immune sera (Table 4).

During studies to develop TMCP2, it was noted that heat-inactivated sera from naïve mice or mice given adjuvant alone (control mice sera), depleted of endogenous complement, supported complement-dependent bactericidal activity against strains FA1090 and 15253 when normal human serum (NHS) was added; both strains are highly resistant to the bactericidal action of NHS alone. In addition, heat-inactivated (56 ° C. for 30 min) NHS added to control mouse sera failed to kill gonococci, suggesting that the observed killing was complement dependent. A systematic analysis of the bactericidal activity of heat-inactivated sera with added NHS from several strains of naïve mice from different sources was carried out (Table 1A-1H). Except for Rag-/- and JHD mice that both lack antibody, heat-inactivated sera from all other mice tested supported human complement-dependent killing of N. gonorrhoeae. Similarly, bactericidal activity was also supported by sera from CD1 mice housed at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, Calif. given Alum adjuvant. Absorption of naïve or adjuvant control mouse sera against anti-mouse IgM agarose, but not protein A/G agarose (depletes IgG), abrogated bactericidal activity (survival >80%), revealing IgM as the antibody subclass responsible for the bactericidal activity. All mouse sera used in (human) complement-dependent bactericidal assays in this study have been depleted of IgM.

Post-dose 3 immune sera (IgM depleted) were tested for bactericidal activity against strain FA1090. Except for one serum sample in the group immunized with 50 μg of TMCP2/dose that showed 47% killing, all immune sera showed >50% killing when tested at a final dilution of 1:6 (immune serum concentration of 16.7%). Three of five immune sera in the 100 μg/dose group and three of four immune sera in the 200 μg/dose group showed >50% killing at greater dilutions (1:30; 3.3% immune serum). Mice that received GLA-SE alone did not show IgG response against LOS and did not support bactericidal activity following IgM depletion.

**In Vitro and In Vivo Efficacy of TMCP2 Tested at Various Doses**

Three groups of female BALB/c mice (n=25 per group) were immunized with three doses of TMCP2 (50, 100, or 200 μg/dose, with GLA-SE adjuvant, 5 μg) given 3 weeks apart. A fourth group (n=25) received GLA-SE alone. Two weeks after the third immunization, mice in the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle were treated with PREMARIN® and challenged with N. gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 (n=6/group) or MS11 (n=6/group). Sera from mice not used for challenge (n=13 in each group) were collected by cardiac bleeding for immunologic studies (IgG LOS ELISA and serum bactericidal assays).

Anti-LOS IgG levels were measured in immune sera (n=13 in each group) from mice not used for challenge experiments. As shown in FIG. 4A, anti-LOS IgG levels in intact immune sera exceeded 2 μg/ml in all mice. The mean anti-LOS IgG levels in the 50, 100, and 200 μg/dose groups were 4.98, 4.06 and 3.8 μg/ml, respectively. None of the sera from mice immunized with GLA-SE alone (adjuvant control) showed detectable anti-gonococcal LOS IgG levels. Anti-LOS IgM levels in pooled immune and pooled adjuvant sera were also measured (FIGS. 13A-13B). Similar IgM binding was measured to 15253 LOS (2C7-positive) and 15253 ΔlgtG LOS (2C7-negative) in immune sera and adjuvant sera indicating no apparent IgM response to the 2C7 epitope in mice (FIG. 13A). Predictably, passage of sera over anti-mouse IgM agarose abrogated IgM detection in both immune and adjuvant control sera. IgG binding to LOS in the same sera were also compared (FIG. 13B); only immune serum, but not adjuvant control serum bound 15253 LOS; no IgG binding to 15253 ΔlgtG LOS was detected.

The 13 individual immune sera in each group collected after the 3rd dose of TMCP2 were tested for ability to kill FA1090 and MS11 in complement-dependent serum bactericidal assays. Dose-dependent killing of N. gonorrhoeae was seen in all three groups. Notably, all sera in each group, when tested at a final concentration of 16.7% (⅙ dilution), resulted >50% complement-dependent killing (<50% survival) of FA1090 (FIG. 4B) and MS11. Strain MS11 was more susceptible than FA1090 to complement-dependent killing by sera from mice that had been immunized with a 50 μg/dose schedule. All 13 immune sera, when used at final concentrations of 3.3%, killed MS11, >60%; 6.7% immune serum concentrations resulted in >98% killing (FIG. 4C). Consistent with the observation that post-dose 3 sera did not possess specific IgM against the 2C7 epitope (FIGS. 13A-13B), significant decreases in killing of either FA1090 (Table 5) or MS11 (Table 6) when IgM was depleted were not noted. None of the antisera from adjuvant control (GLA-SE alone) mice showed any bactericidal activity (>100% survival; Table 5 and Table 6).

FIGS. 3A-3B show experimental challenge data with FA1090 and MS11, respectively, all three doses of TMCP2 accelerated clearance and diminished colonization with each of the gonococcal strains over the 11-day course of the experiments, compared to the adjuvant control. Mice challenged with FA1090 showed a transient ‘reappearance’ of bacteria on day 7 (MS11 ‘reappeared’ on day 6); in the case of FA1090, reappearance of the organism resulted in delayed clearance compared to MS11 (Kaplan Meier curves; left graphs). The rate of decline of CFU with time (middle graphs) and the Area Under Curve analyses (right graphs) showed similar vaccine efficacy at all three doses and against both isolates.

Efficacy of TMCP2 using a Biweekly Schedule

A more compressed schedule of immunization (dosing at 2 week instead of 3 week intervals) was also examined using the lower dose (50 μg of TMCP2), the latter as an approximation of the dose that might be used in human immunization. Mice were immunized with 50 μg of TMCP2 plus GLA-SE using 3, 50 μg doses, each given 2 weeks apart. Two weeks after the third dose, mice (n=14/group) were challenged with strain FA1090 (107 CFU). This immunization regimen also effectively attenuated gonococcal colonization (FIG. 5A). The mean anti-LOS level in the 11 immunized post-dose 3 immune sera obtained from non-infected mice was 2.31 μg/ml (standard deviation 0.68; range 1.33-3.59 μg/ml) (FIG. 5B). All sera showed bactericidal activity (>50% killing at 1:6 dilution [16.7% antiserum concentration]) (FIG. 5B) and similar to that achieved by similar/higher TMCP2 dosing and administration at longer intervals (FIGS. 3A-3B). Again, IgM depletion from sera did not significantly impact bactericidal activity (Table 7).

In a separate experiment, 5 mice were immunized with TMCP2 (50m/dose) plus GLA-SE, or GLA-SE alone at 0, 2 and 4 weeks and collected serum and vaginal swabs 2 weeks after the third dose for measurement of anti-LOS IgG. Anti-LOS IgG was detected in vaginal swabs of all 5 mice given TMCP2 (Table 8).

**Discussion**

A candidate gonococcal peptide vaccine, which elicits bactericidal antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae, significantly reduces the duration and burden of gonococcal cervicovaginal colonization in BALB/c mice. Combining TMCP2 with the Th1-biased adjuvant GLA-SE evoked 2C7 epitope-specific IgG antibody responses after immunization with three intramuscular doses. Studies in mice also suggest that a Th1 response clears infection and induces a memory response (35), which lends support to using Th1-inducing adjuvants for gonococcal vaccines.

A limitation of an octameric peptide vaccine used in a previous study (13) was heterogeneity of the molecular mass of the preparation, likely the result of formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds. To circumvent this problem, a novel synthetic method in which each peptide subunit was first circularized with a covalent, non-reducible thioether bond was devised; each of the circularized subunits was then linked to a dendrimeric Glu backbone. Attempts to synthesize an octameric peptide using this method were technically challenging; instead, a tetrapeptide multiple antigenic peptide was synthesized for evaluation. The resulting compound, TMCP2, showed a single peak on mass spectroscopy. This relatively facile synthesis process yielded a compound of greater than 95% purity, which is suitable for scale-up and production of an inexpensive gonococcal vaccine candidate.

Activation of the classical pathway of complement requires engagement of the Cl complex (subunits of C1q, C1r and C1s), triggered by Fc antibody domains. Upon binding to surfaces, Fc domains of proximate IgG molecules form ordered hexamers through non-covalent interactions (29), which then simultaneously engage multiple globular heads of C1q, also a hexameric molecule. Multimeric interactions between globular domains of C1q and Fc convert otherwise low-affinity monomeric IgG Fc-C1q associations to interactions of high avidity, which permits autocatalysis of C1r and further complement activation. An effective bactericidal antibody requires a critical density of surface targets to engage C1q and permit complement activation. On a molar basis, LOS is the most abundant gonococcal outer membrane molecule and serves as a convenient target for binding of closely spaced antibody molecules whose Fc domains can then readily engage the C1 complex an activate complement. It has been shown that an intact complement system is necessary and sufficient for efficacy of passively administered bactericidal mAb 2C7—given either systemically or intravaginally—in the mouse vaginal colonization model (58). The importance of complement in host defenses against gonorrhea, is highlighted by the observation that both congenital and acquired defects of individual terminal components of complement are associated with an increased incidence of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) (30-33). Based the data with mAb 2C7, it is proposed that attenuation of colonization by antibodies elicited by TMCP2 vaccine also occurs via complement-dependent bactericidal antibody activity. A vaccine candidate that comprises gonococcal outer membrane vesicles plus microencapsulated IL-12 given intravaginally requires B cell activity, presumably to produce antibodies (34), however, a requirement for complement has not been shown.

Similar to the research findings, no other gonococcal vaccine candidates tested in the cervicovaginal colonization model in estradiol-treated mice show sterilizing immunity (34, 35, 36). Immunomodulatory effects of estrogen (37) may curb immune defenses that are important to clear N. gonorrhoeae. Seminal studies over 50 years ago (38) showed that the activity of terminal complement components in male mice exceeds, by 8- to 10-fold, activity in female mice. Administration of testosterone increases complement activity; estrogen has the opposite effect (39). Therefore, a vaccine antibody response that utilizes terminal complement to act in concert with the bactericidal action of antibody may also require waning of the suppressive effects of estrogen on terminal complement components before full bactericidal activity is restored.

A retrospective epidemiologic analysis showed that a detergent extracted meningococcal outer membrane vesicle (dOMV) vaccine called MeNZB designed and implemented in a widespread vaccination program to control an epidemic of group B meningococcal disease in New Zealand, showed diminished coverage in populations subsequently infected with N. gonorrhoeae—calculated as 31% effectiveness of MenZB in decreasing gonococcal infection—reduced to 14% in populations co-infected with N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia, a frequent clinical occurrence (40-42). Meningococci and gonococci share several similarities and it is possible that one or more proteins in MeNZB that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae may elicit protective immune responses. Individuals administered a licensed group B meningococcal vaccine, Bexsero®, which contains 5 recombinant meningococcal protein antigens in addition to the same dOMV that constitutes MeNZB (43), elicit antibodies, immunochemically, that cross-react with N. gonorrhoeae (44). Antibodies elicited by immunizing mice with Bexsero® or MeNZB were reported to support bactericidal activity against N. gonorrhoeae (59). However, a separate study did not reveal bactericidal antibody activity against N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 in immune sera from individuals vaccinated with Bexsero® (28). How MeNZB provides protection against gonorrhea remains unclear; possible mechanisms may include reduction of adhesion of Ng to human cervical cells, as demonstrated with murine antibodies elicited by Bexsero® or MeNZB (59). Currently, several gonococcal vaccine candidates are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation (reviewed in Ref. (5)), some of which elicit bactericidal activity (45-47). Knowledge of the immune defenses responsible for clearing gonococcal infection is an important aspect of developing effective vaccines against this disease.

Three glycosyltransferase genes—lgtA, lgtC, lgtD—nvolved in LOS biosynthesis are phase-variable because of slipped-strand mispairing of homopolymeric poly-G tracts in their open reading frames (48, 49); a fourth, lgtG, containing a poly-C tract is also phase variable (12, 50-53). Expression of the 2C7 epitope requires lgtG to be phase-varied ‘on’; expression status of the three other lgt genes modulate binding of mAb 2C7 to LOS (11). As discussed above, the 2C7 LOS epitope is expressed almost universally in vivo and by minimally passaged isolates. The 2C7 epitope was identified in 64 of 68 (94%) gonococcal isolates examined directly in cervical secretions from women in a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Boston in the early 1990s and 96 of 101 (95%) of randomly chosen minimally (second-passage) isolates (7). Recently, it was reported that 100% of 75 minimally passaged isolates from China also expressed the 2C7 epitope (16). Importantly, mAb 2C7 was bactericidal (>50% killing) against each (100%) of the 62 isolates tested in complement-dependent bactericidal assays, including strains that expressed low levels of the epitope (13). Because LOS is the most abundant outer membrane molecule on gonococci, expression of the 2C7 epitope on even a small fraction of LOS may permit binding of antibody at a density sufficient to engage the C1 complex and activate the classical pathway. It is speculated that widespread expression of this epitope results from gonococci's ability to sialylate lactose expressed from HepII, which facilitates engagement of Siglec receptors (17). Many Siglec receptors signal through their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) tails (54) to dampen host inflammatory responses that otherwise sense invading pathogens (55, 56). Neu5Ac (sialic acid) that caps lactose from HepII also inhibits complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface (16). Genetic deletion of lgtG or lst (sialyltransferase) from a strain whose only site for sialylation is the terminal Gal of HepII lactose markedly attenuates the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to colonize the vagina of estradiol-treated mice (13, 16). Additional evidence for the importance of lgtG expression was provided by Lam and Gray-Owen, who showed that serial passage of N. gonorrhoeae in mice was accompanied by increased fitness of bacteria with each generation—i.e., an increasing fraction of mice could be infected with bacteria recovered from each successive mouse passage. Intriguingly, there was a reproducible positive selection for gonococcal variants with lgtG ‘on’ (57). Resistance to antibodies elicited by a ‘2C7 vaccine’ would require lgtG to be turned completely ‘off’. Based on the accumulated evidence from: studies of minimally passaged isolates; bacteria examined directly ex vivo from humans (without passage on media) and studies in mice—as discussed above, it is proposed that mutations in gonococci that eliminate 2C7 LOS epitope would render the organism less fit and avirulent. From a public health perspective, translation to a decrease in burden and duration of infection can have profound effects on disease pathology and transmission. In conclusion, TMCP2 represents an important step forward in the development of a safe, economical and effective gonococcal vaccine, or subcomponent thereof.

Peptide constructs prior to derivation of the Lead Candidate (Numbers in Brackets Refer to Compounds Listed in Table 2 that Indicate Chemical Structures Screened for Use in this Study)

The Tetra-MAP preparation (termed Tetra MAP 1 [1]; and an Octa-MAP preparation (termed Octa MAP1 [2]) that had been used in a previous immunization/challenge study (--challenge performed with Octa-MAP 1 only) (Gulati S, Zheng B, Reed G W, Su X, Cox A D, St Michael F, Stupak J, Lewis L A, Ram S, Rice P A. 2013. PLoS Pathog 9:e1003559) was synthesized by ‘step-wise’ addition of amino acids to a poly-lysine core. This resulted in a heterogenous preparation (Table 1A; western blot showed for the Octa-MAP preparation only) that while effective in immunization/challenge studies, was not suitable for further clinical development.

To overcome heterogeneity of the immunogen, all further attempts used a ‘modular’ synthesis approach, where highly purified (and cyclized where indicated) peptides were added ‘en bloc’ to the core. Synthesis of Tetra-MAP (termed Tetra MAP 1.1 [3]) using the ‘modular’ approach and the original core yielded the same compound as the ‘step-wise’ prepared material. A 2nd compound that substituted serine for Cys at the N-terminal Cys residue (termed Tetra MAP 1.2 [4]) to reduce internal disulfide formation was also produced. Neither compound was superior to ‘step-wise’ produced material in immunogenicity studies (shown below in FIG. 18).

Construction of a Tetra-MAP was attempted utilizing 4 maleimide (MAL) residues from a Lys dendrimer core (Table 1B) that would link sulfydryl groups (-SH) of the N-terminal cysteine directly to the (poly) lysine core. However, additional reaction of the maleimide residues with primary amines in the monomeric peptide in this reaction resulted in a product that was poorly soluble and highly heterogeneous; this approach was also abandoned.

In experiments to modify linkages of the monomeric peptide mimitope (PEP1) to the core, an Octa-MAP was made by first protecting the N-terminal Cys of the mimitope (PEP1) with a tert-butylsulfinyl (StBu) group [5] or replacing the N-terminal Cys with serine [6] and then linking the C-terminal Cys of the monomeric peptide to a heterobifunctional cross-linker intermediary molecule (MAL-PEG4-NHS), through the maleimide (MAL) reactive group (Table 1C). The reactive N-hydrosuccinimide (NHS) at the N-terminus was displaced and PEP1-MAL-PEG4 molecules were amide-linked to each of 8 Lys residues of a Poly-Lys backbone. Polyethylene glycol (PEG4) was included to ensure a water-soluble product. Unfortunately, this synthetic process, although yielding a homogenous compound (FIG. 16), was too inefficient and expensive for production and scale-up.

In order to eliminate heterogeneity, three processes were considered to modify the monomeric peptides: (i) elimination or replacement of terminal cysteines, (ii) use of Click chemistry as means to link peptide to the core and (iii) use of Reverse MAP synthesis (Reverse MAP entails positioning carboxyl groups in the core for modification by amine components from the peptide monomers) to link several versions of the initial peptides in stable cyclic forms using either disulfide or thioether bonds resulting in stable cyclic peptides that would be easier to purify, simplify chemical synthesis and increase the yield of the multiantigenic peptide (MAP).

In the first process, PEP1 preparations were modified at the termini, also to eliminate Cys (labeled Mod 1 [7], Mod 2 [8], Mod 3 [9] and Mod 4 [10] [Table 1D and FIG. 17]) and tested for comparative antigenicity using mAb 2C7 as the probe. Mod 3, the most antigenic, was used to make 4 different Tetra-MAP derivatives (Tetra MAP 3.1 [11], TetraMAP 3.2 [12], TetraMAP 3.3 [13] and TetraMAP 3.4 [14]) (Table 1E) each of which, used singly, was poorly immunogenic in BALB/c mice (FIG. 18; TetraMAP 1.1 [3] and TetraMAP 1.2 [4] were also tested for immunogenicity). Two linear concatemers of Mod 3, containing 2 copies of the nominal peptide using different length spacers were also non-immunogenic (Table 1H, [15] and [16]).

A second approach to conjugate the peptide mimitope (cyclic) to the core using Click chemistry (copper-catalyzed reaction of an azide with an alkyne to form a 5-membered heteroatom ring) was then used. Several cyclic monomeric mimotope peptides were constructed (Click pep#1 through Click pep#4; Table 1G and [17] and [18]) and used in the Click chemistry approach to couple them to Click Core 4 (Table 1G and FIGS. 20A-20B) but this approach yielded low amounts of product with excess residual substrate (FIGS. 20A-20B; [17] and [18]); this approach was therefore abandoned.

Finally, use of a reverse MAP core, where conjugation of monomers ([19], [20] and [21]) were carried out through the C-terminus of the core structure. One of the preparations, Tetra-MAP Cyclic Peptide 2 (TMCP2) [22], was modified at the N-terminus of the monomeric peptide (PEP1) so a stable non-reducible (covalent) thioether bond formed a cyclized peptide with the C-terminal Cys of the peptide (Table 1H). The two other peptides, TMCP3 [23] and TMCP4, [24] each contained internal disulfide bonds when cyclized leading, potentially, to the formation of heterogenous molecules (Table 1H). TMCP3 bound best to mAb 2C7 as determined by inhibition ELISA (FIG. 9). TMCP2 and TMCP3 yielded higher anti-LOS titers than TMCP4 in immunization experiments that used the tetrapeptides plus Sigma MPL adjuvant (FIG. 10). Anti-TMCP2 antisera showed maximal complement-dependent bactericidal activity against N. gonorrhoeae strain 15253 in immunized mice (FIG. 11) and was chosen for further development. It is worth noting that affinity of binding to mAb 2C7 did not correlate with the functional antibody response. In light of its stability and performance in functional studies, TMCP2 was chosen as the lead candidate and was characterized further.
