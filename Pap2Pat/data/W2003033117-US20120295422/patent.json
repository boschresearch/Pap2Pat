                        "The present invention relates to the manufacturing of semiconductor light-emitting devices using indium gallium nitride (InGaN) semiconductor material. More specifically, the present invention relates to a technique for epitaxially growing high-quality semiconductor material with a multi-quantum well (MQW) structure.",
                        "2. Related Art",
                        "Group III-V nitride compounds (e.g., GaN, InN, and AIN) and alloy-compounds (e.g., AlGaN, InGaN, and AlGAlnN) have demonstrated efficient luminescence in the blue-green spectrum. This efficiency has been the driving force for their recent application in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes, which in turn has changed the market for color displays. Using group III-V nitride materials for high-brightness LEDs has opened the door to many applications previously deemed unfeasible, such as in traffic lights and in flat-panel display as white light sources. In addition, ultra-violet laser diodes using group III-V nitride materials are now widely used in scientific instrumentation, laboratories, and commercial products.",
                        "The active region of an LED is the area where light is generated. It typically includes a multi-quantum well (MQW) structure, which includes multiple periods of quantum well structures. A single quantum well structure may include, for example, an indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based potential well (well) sandwiched between potential barriers (barriers) based on gallium nitride (GaN) or aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) materials. Carriers are trapped in the well between the barriers. An MQW structure allows higher carrier density and hence increases the carrier recombination rate. The faster the carriers recombine, the more efficient a light-emitting device becomes.",
                        "One of the factors that determine the color of the light emitted by an LED is the concentration of indium (In) in the MQW structure. Specifically, the color of the light emitted by an LED can vary with different InGaN concentration or InGaN-to-GaN ratios in the MQW structure. The higher the concentration of In or InGaN-to-GaN ratio, the longer the wavelength of the visible light. For instance, an LED emitting green light may exhibit a higher concentration of In in the MQW structure than one emitting blue light because the wavelength of green light is longer than that of blue light. One of the challenges of producing light with longer wavelengths is to increase the concentration of In in the MQW structure while maintaining the quality of the MQW structure.",
                        "Typically, the LED-fabrication process involves subjecting the structure to a relatively high temperature to obtain a high-quality MQW structure. In a conventional method, the InGaN well in an MQW structure is grown at a moderate temperature to increase the concentration of In, and the temperature is subsequently raised at least 100\u00b0 C. for the growth of GaN barriers.",
                        "The temperature for fabricating an MQW structure is ideally lower than 800\u00b0 C. to avoid the breaking of the indium-nitrogen bond in the InGaN well. However, fabricating an MQW structure at a lower temperature could result in a low-quality MQW structure."

This process is divided into five periods, denoted as periods 110, 120, 130, 140, and 150, respectively. An InGaN well is grown during period 110 at temperature t1. Subsequently, during period 120, the temperature is raised from t1 to t2. The quantum well grown in period 110 is then annealed and stabilized at temperature t2 during period 130. Next, a GaN barrier is grown during period 140 at temperature t2. The temperature is subsequently lowered during period 150 in preparation of the growth of another quantum well or other structures.",

The flow of TMGa is turned on and the flow rate is increased from 1.4 to 8 sccm. Note that the active region fabricated using the conventional method when forward-biased can produce visible light with a wavelength of approximately 470 nm. The temperature is reduced when operation 310 is completed. After operations 304 to 310 are repeated for a predetermined number of times, a group III-V p-type nitride layer is then formed above the active region, and ohmic contacts are constructed.",

Meanwhile, during the annealing process, the fabricated InGaN semiconductor material is exposed in a temperature that is 100\u00b0 C. higher than the initial growth temperature. This higher temperature can break the In\u2014N bond in the potential well, which results in the vaporization of In. Consequently, the concentration of In is reduced. Although increasing the ratio of In to Ga can increase the concentration of In, the effect is minimal, because during the subsequent annealing process a substantial amount of In can still escape from the grown potential well.",

In one embodiment, In is fabricated at a relatively low temperature. The structure subsequently undergoes an annealing process in an In-rich environment at a higher temperature. During the annealing process, the precursor flow of TMIn remains on. The flow rate of TMIn is predetermined based on the desired color of the emitted light.",

However, the In precursor flows continue while the temperature in the reactor chamber is gradually increased to a second temperature. In one embodiment, the flow rate of TMIn increases gradually at a predetermined rate so as to reduce the rate of the vaporization of In.

The first temperature is higher than that in a conventional method. This higher temperature results in a better-quality quantum well, compared with that fabricated using the conventional method. Nitrogen is used as the carrier gas, and TMIn and TMGa are used as precursors. The flow rate of TMIn is approximately 260 sccm and that of TMGa is approximately 1.4 sccm.",
                        "The temperature in the reactor chamber is gradually raised from 830\u00b0 C. to approximately 950\u00b0 C. The semiconductor material remains in the chamber at 950\u00b0 C. for approximately 100 seconds. The TMGa flow is shut off, but the flow rate of TMIn is increased gradually from 50 to 150 sccm so as to reduce the rate of the vaporization of In.",
                        "The reactor chamber remains at 950\u00b0 C. for approximately 60 seconds for the fabricated material to anneal and stabilize. This 60-second settling time stabilizes the MQW structure and prevents defect formation. The flow of TMIn continues at 150 sccm while TMGa remains off",
                        "After the completion of the InGaN potential well, a GaN barrier is epitaxially grown at 950\u00b0 C. for approximately 60 seconds. The flow of TMGa is turned on and the flow rate is set at 8 sccm. The fabricated active region produces light with a wavelength of approximately 470 nm and with a power output of 7 mW. Subsequently, the temperature in the reactor chamber is lowered in preparation for the growth of the next quantum-well period.",
