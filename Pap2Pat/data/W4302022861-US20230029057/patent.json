                        "Typical iBCIs require implanting electrodes in the brain to acquire brain data for developing decoders. The biggest challenge in developing decoders is recruiting people willing to undergo this highly invasive implantation procedure. In order to solve this problem, embodiments of the subject invention use human operators (with no implanted electrodes required; i.e., the procedure is non-invasive) interacting with machine learning techniques to generate abundant emulated brain data to develop decoders.",
                        "The emulated brain data can be generated via the interaction of a healthy human operator (with no implanted electrodes required; i.e., the procedure is non-invasive) interacting with an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN can be trained with kinematics (e.g., hand kinematics or any other type, including imagined kinematics) and real brain data recorded by invasive sensors. The ANN can learn the relationship between the hand kinematics data and the real brain data. After training, the ANN can generate emulated brain data by processing new hand kinematics data given to it as an input. The ANN has been validated (see Example 1) to ensure the emulated brain data are similar to real brain data.",
                        "The ANN can generate emulated brain data by taking hand kinematics data as input. The kinematics data can be acquired by different devices (e.g., a data glove or a motion capture system).",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention provide alternative options (i.e., alternative to invasive options) for developing iBCI decoders. This is accomplished non-invasively by using emulated brain data. A process of using this technology to develop an iBCI decoder for controlling a computer cursor can include the following. First, the task can be defined (e.g., moving the cursor to click a shortcut icon on a display). Second, the task performance metric(s) can be defined (e.g., time to finish the task). Third, at least one type of decoder can be selected (e.g., two types of decoders, such as comparing position Kalman filter and velocity Kalman filter). Fourth, an experiment can be designed (e.g., 30 participants in each group, with each participant performing 100 trials of the task). Fifth, the experiment can be performed with emulated brain data. Sixth, the results can be interpreted to get to the finding (e.g., the average time is shorter when using velocity Kalman filter). Seventh, the decoder (e.g., velocity Kalman filter) can be applied to a real iBCI.",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention allow an iBCI developer to perform experiments with more participants, which is not possible for conventional iBCIs. This not only speeds up the development process but also lets the developer test many decoders. Embodiments therefore help to advance the application of iBCIs.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of a system for developing a brain computer interface, according to an embodiment of the subject invention. Referring to FIG. 1, element 1 and element 2 are two of the main components of the system. An important contribution of the system is to provide an efficient protocol to develop the decoder (labeled \u201c3\u201d). Element 1 is a data glove or a motion capture system, which can have sensors (e.g., 19 sensors or at least 19 sensors) to register real-time hand gesture kinematics and send to the ANN (labeled \u201c2\u201d). Though FIG. 1 shows a data glove, this is for exemplary purposes only and should not be construed as limiting. The ANN can be trained (e.g., before being connected with the data glove) on hand kinematics and/or real neuron firing rate. The ANN can take hand kinematics as input (e.g., while connected to the data glove) and generate emulated neuron firing rates. The decoder (labeled \u201c3\u201d) can translate real-time emulated neuron firing rates to control command(s). A main innovation of embodiments is to provide an efficient protocol to test different algorithms for the decoder. The external device (labeled \u201c4\u201d) is the end effector of the brain computer interface. The external device can be, for example, a robot arm, a wheelchair, a keyboard, or a computer (e.g., a laptop). Though FIG. 1 shows a laptop as the external device, this is for exemplary purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.",
                        "Referring still to FIG. 1, reference \u201cA\u201d represents hand gesture kinematics (e.g., multi-dimensional time series hand gesture kinematics of the hand). Hand gesture kinematics can be recorded by the data glove (or other motion capture system) and sent to the ANN as the input. Reference \u201cB\u201d represents emulated neuron firing rates (e.g., emulated firing rate(s) of the primary motor cortex). Reference \u201cC\u201d represents control command (e.g., the command to control the external device). For example, to control a computer cursor, the command can be a 2-vector of velocity in the x direction and velocity in the y direction. The format of the command depends on the external device.",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention can use hand gesture kinematics to generate emulated neuron firing rates. The ANN can be trained (e.g., on a plurality of different hand gestures (e.g., 8 different hand gestures). In real-time application, the ANN can take any hand gesture(s) and generate emulated neuron firing rates. The ANN can learn the general mapping between the hand gestures and neuron firing rates. The selected different hand gestures (e.g., 8 different hand gestures) can be verified if desired (e.g., through principal component analysis) to make sure the hand gestures are distinctive.",
                        "The input data of the ANN can be recorded (e.g., from one or more mammalian subjects, such as human subjects and/or primate subjects (e.g., one or more rhesus monkeys (e.g., two rhesus monkeys))). Multiple sessions (e.g., 22 sessions) can be performed with different numbers of neurons recorded (e.g., ranging from 23-93 neurons). Neuron firing rates can be recorded when the subject(s) perform different arm movements (e.g., 8 different arm movements) for multiple trials in each session. Each arm movement can be paired with a hand gesture as the input-output to train the ANN.",
                        "FIG. 2 shows the architecture of an ANN, according to an embodiment of the subject invention. At time t, the input layer had the data from time t plus four previous time steps. The total number of nodes is 19\u00d75=95 nodes, and each node is connected to all the nodes in hidden layer-1. There are 4 hidden layers of 150, 100, 50, and 30 nodes, respectively. Hidden layer-1 and hidden layer-2 are shared across all sessions. Hidden layer-3 and hidden layer-4 are transfer learning layers that are unique to each session. The input layer of the ANN can be the time series of hand gestures with 19 dimensions. The output of the ANN can be the neuron firing rates (e.g., monkey neuron firing rates if monkeys are used as the subjects for which the ANN training data were gathered). There can be four hidden layers between the input and output (e.g., with 150, 100, 50, and 30 nodes, respectively). All the hidden layers can be fully connected. The activation function in each layer can be, for example, a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function.",
                        "Because the numbers and types of neurons in each session were different (and are different for the end-user in practice across many days of iBCI use), the ANN can emulate firing rates of various dimensions from different sessions. Instead of training one network for one session, the ANN can be trained with the technique of transfer learning. The first two hidden layers can be used as the shared layers to capture the general dynamics and replace the last two hidden layers to capture the session specific dynamics. The first two hidden layers can be trained constantly, and the last two hidden layers may be only trained with the associated session. The weights of hidden layer-1 and hidden layer-2 can be updated in the training of all the sessions whereas the weights of hidden layer-3 and hidden layer-4 may be only updated in the training of the associated session. Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation can be used to train the ANN on the loss function of mean absolute error. The training of one session can be terminated when the performance gradient is smaller than a predetermined value (e.g., 10\u22126) or after a predetermined training epoch (e.g., after training 200 epochs). A round of training can be to train all sessions (e.g., 22 sessions) at once, and the order of the sessions can be randomized in one round. The network can be trained for many rounds (e.g., 1000 rounds or at least 1000 rounds), and the round with the minimum mean absolute error can be selected as the final ANN. All the hyper parameters reported were tuned by grid search to have the best training performance.",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention address the technical problem of developing decoders for iBCIs that do not require invasive implantation in the subject(s) by providing systems, methods, and protocols that utilize a motion capture system (e.g., a data glove) and an ANN to develop iBCI decoders non-invasively by using emulated brain data.",
