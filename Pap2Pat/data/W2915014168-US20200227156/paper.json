    "title": "Personalized Nutrient Profiling of Food Patterns: Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Nutrition Algorithm Applied to Dietary Intakes from NHANES",
    "date": "2019-02-12",
    "abstract": "Nutrient profiling (NP) models have been used to assess the nutritional quality of single foods. NP methodologies can also serve to assess the quality of total food patterns. The objective of this study was to construct a personalized nutrient-based scoring system for diet quality and optimal calories. The new Nestl\u00e9 Nutrition Algorithm (NNA) is based on age and gender-specific healthy ranges for energy and nutrient intakes over a 24 h period. To promote nutrient balance, energy and nutrient intakes either below or above pre-defined healthy ranges are assigned lower diet quality scores. NNA-generated diet quality scores for female 2007\u207b2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants were compared to their Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010 scores. Comparisons involved correlations, joint contingency tables, and Bland Altman plots. The NNA approach showed good correlations with the HEI 2010 scores. NNA mean scores for 7 days of two exemplary menu plans (MyPlate and DASH) were 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 (SD) and 0.91 \u00b1 0.02 (SD), respectively. By contrast, diets of NHANES participants scored 0.45 \u00b1 0.14 (SD) and 0.48 \u00b1 0.14 on first and second days, respectively. The NNA successfully captured the high quality of MyPlate and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) menu plans and the lower quality of diets actually consumed in the US.",

                "Nutrient profiling (NP) models were developed to assess nutrient density of individual foods [1] expressed per 100 kcal, 100 g, or per serving [2]. Favorable nutrient profiles have provided the scientific basis for the adjudication of nutrition and health claims and for front-of-pack labels and logos [3]. Unfavorable nutrient profiles, largely linked to excessive food content of calories, fat, sugar, and salt, have been used to develop warning labels and to limit marketing and advertising to children [4,5,6,7]. The food industry has also used NP modeling methods to evaluate and (re)formulate product portfolios [8].",
                "While most of the existing NP models apply to single foods, the current emphasis in public health nutrition is on nutrient density of habitual food patterns [9,10]. NP methods, often based on nutrients-to-calories ratio, were recently used to evaluate the nutrient balance of MyPlate meals [11]. Most recently, the Nutrient Rich Food (NRF9.3) index was used for a standardized analysis of diet quality for children and adults in nationally representative nutrition surveys from Canada, Denmark, France, Spain, UK, and the US [12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. NP modeling was used to assess diet quality across countries in preference to alternative diet quality measures, such as the Healthy Eating Index (HEI).",
                "Initially developed in 1995 [19], the HEI is a 100 point scale that measures compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are revised and reissued every 5 years [20]. Following the Dietary Guidelines, the HEI incorporates concepts of adequacy and moderation. The most recent versions have incorporated food groups to encourage (e.g., leafy green vegetables, whole fruit), food groups to limit (refined grains) as well as desirable nutrients (plant protein) and desirable nutrient ratios (saturated to unsaturated fat). Adjusting the HEI for 1000 kcal means that diet quality scores do not increase with higher energy intakes.",
                "Given that the HEI is a hybrid tool, inclusive of both nutrients and food groups, its calculations critically depend on the availability of the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) formerly known as the MyPyramid Equivalents Database (MPED). The FPED converts the foods and beverages in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies to the 37 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Patterns components that are used to calculate HEI. While FPED data are available from the USDA, they have not been calculated by agencies in Canada, Denmark, France, Spain, or the UK. For that reason, the HEI measure cannot be used outside the US.",
                "Some countries have developed similar indices to monitor compliance with local dietary guidelines. Examples include Canada [21], Spain [22], Brazil [23], and Australia [24]. However, those approaches are far from standardized. In all cases, better compliance with dietary guidelines\u2014variously assessed through food or nutrient consumption thresholds, ranges, or daily amounts\u2014led to a higher diet quality scores.",
                "The NNA is a new nutrient-based model that assesses the nutrient density of dietary patterns with no need of MPED or FPED databases. As such, the present NNA model can be applied worldwide, wherever population energy and nutrient intake data are available. Unlike the HEI approach, the NNA model is energy adjusted. Therefore, in contrast to the HEI model, under- or over-consumption of energy and nutrients leads to lower scores. This paper provides the scoring system, together with the steps taken to demonstrate its validity and reliability."

This suggests that the dimensionality cannot be substantially reduced. Principal component analysis confirmed that a number of components (nutrients) independently contribute to the overall score. In other words, the PCA provides evidence that no one single linear combination of the components of the NNA accounts for a substantial proportion of the covariation in dietary patterns. In order to explain at least 90% of the variance, one needs at least nine or 10 factors. It should be noted that the principal components are linear combinations of nutrient scores, and not just nutrient scores."

                "The data analysis presented in this paper supports the reliability and validity of the new Nestl\u00e9 Nutrition Algorithm. Exemplary menu plans are a useful way of testing the construct validity of a diet score, and has been used previously with the HEI [34]. The NNA algorithm could differentiate between the nutritional quality of two exemplary menu plans (as proxies for healthy diets) and the nutritional quality of NHANES participants (with similar energy intakes). The score is derived from 16 nutrients, as well as energy, meaning that no single nutrient influences the overall score. Rather, it is the overall nutrient signature that influences the score, with maximal scores being obtained for exemplary menu plans. Although the scoring system is based on nutrients, it can predict all of the food groups that we looked at, except for refined grains. This means that low NNA scores can be improved by increasing the diversity of food groups.",
                "The internal consistency of the nutrition algorithm is good, as indicated by a Cronbach\u2019s Alpha score of 0.73 using NHANES data. However, the correlation matrix indicates that there are associations between numbers of nutrients. The associations between potassium, magnesium, folate, and fiber might be explained by the coexistence of these nutrients in vegetables. The associations between vitamin A, vitamin D, and calcium could be explained by the coexistence of these nutrients in dairy products.",
                "This paper has shown that higher scores are obtained for the diets of women of middle and high socio-economic status versus women of low socio-economic status. This is expected, as it is consistent with previous findings of a positive association between indices of socio-economic status and micronutrient intake and status [35].",
                "The NNA approach is to award maximum scores when both energy and nutrients fall within an ideal healthy range. Lower scores are given when nutrients are either above or below this range. This approach differs from other dietary scoring methods in which a maximal micronutrient score is capped at 100% of the nutrient requirements [3,11]. Nevertheless, the idea of an optimal range for nutrients is not new. Twenty years ago, Wirsam and Uthus (1996) proposed a new mathematical approach for scoring the nutritional quality of diets based on fuzzy logic [36]. They assigned values to the intake of nutrients, with values increasing from zero to a maximum of 1.0 when the optimal level was reached, and thereafter falling when the amount exceeded the optimal level and became harmful to health. By creating and combining sets of scores for numerous nutrients, the authors could demonstrate how closely a diet met the national recommendations [36]. Their model included all nutrients (i.e., they were not specifically selected) and there was no consideration of energy. This approach has more recently been applied to food groups for a range of energy levels as means of developing healthy diets [37].",
                "An important point of differentiation between the present algorithm, and others, is the energy adjustment. This novel adjustment means that when a 24 h diet is within 15% of energy needs, the score reflects only dietary quality. When energy intake falls outside this ideal range, the score starts to fall, reaching zero when implausibly low or excessive energy levels are reached. NNA scores are not correlated with HEI 2010 scores because HEI measures diet quality independently of quantity. However, when the analysis of NHANES data was restricted caloric intakes between 1700 and 2300 kcal then we observed statistically significant correlations between the HEI 2010 and NNA. The more energy intake is outside the healthy range, the greater is the negative impact of energy on the overall score. The goal is to encourage the consumption of nutrient dense foods and optimize calories, consistent with food-based dietary guidelines.",
                "Consequently, it could be interesting to explore the potential for the NNA to serve as a tool for tracking diet quality and quantity at the population level. Tracking dietary quality over time is problematic using the HEI because the algorithm is regularly modified in line with updates to the US dietary guidelines. An advantage of the NNA is that it effectively distinguishes a healthy eating pattern from an unhealthy one, and could therefore be used in other countries with similar nutrient requirements, even though the foods and beverages consumed may be different. The NNA could potentially also be used by individuals interested in tracking their own diet scores. Such an application could include using portable devices (phone, laptop).",
                "A potential limitation for the use of the algorithm is the availability of nutrient information. Nutrient information is available for a wide range of foods and beverages in relevant nutrient databases, but inevitably, there are many foods and beverages that are not documented in these databases. The nutrition label of packaged foods provides many of the nutrients required, but not all. Added sugars can be a particular problem, since values are not readily available in public databases. However, the introduction of newly-revised labelling information in the US will mean that added sugars as well as vitamin D will be included on the label, although potassium and vitamins A and C will no longer appear. At the same time, databases are increasingly reporting added sugars (e.g., the Australian nutrient database). This has been facilitated by the introduction of robust algorithms for estimating added sugars [38].",
                "An additional limitation of this, or any other diet score, is the quality of food intake data. The measurement of food intake is thwarted by well-known methodological problems such as underreporting, and variability in food intake on different days of the week. Theoretically, dietary recalls, or analyzing the nutrient content of a duplicate diet, would be the most reliable ways of generating food intake data [39]. The advent of new technologies that can be used with hand held devices such as Smartphones, will help individuals to capture food intake in real-time more reliably. Such technologies include the use of photographs, [40] barcodes, and voice [41]."
