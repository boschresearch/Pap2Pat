                        "Despite recent progress in combating the malaria parasite, nearly 200 million people are infected and around 600,000 deaths are recorded every year, mostly young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Besides reducing mortality in areas of high malaria transmission, new goals laid out by the WHO aim to eliminate malaria in low endemicity countries through a combination of interventions targeting both the parasite and mosquito vector. Even with new drugs and vaccines in the pipeline, control of Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria remains the cornerstone of malaria prevention and transmission reduction efforts. Of the four classes of insecticides available for mosquito control, pyrethroids are the only compounds approved for use on long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bed nets (LLINs) due to low toxicity, and are heavily used in indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs. This is a major limitation, as the increased application of both interventions over the last decade has inevitably led to the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in natural mosquito populations. Indeed, fully susceptible Anopheles populations cannot be found in any African country, making the identification of alternative compounds that are non-toxic to humans and that can reduce disease transmission a high priority in the malaria control agenda.",
                        "Insecticide-based interventions impact malaria transmission by increasing the mortality rate of exposed females and, in the case of LLINs, by preventing mosquitoes from biting humans. Mathematical models developed to aid in the design of malaria elimination programs during the first global eradication campaign showed the importance of increasing mosquito mortality, which reduces the probability that mosquitoes survive for the 12-14 day incubation period of the malaria parasite. However, other aspects of mosquito biology that determine vectorial capacity for malaria transmission, such as host preferences for blood-feeding, immune responses to the parasites, and mosquito population densities, have not yet been exploited for malaria control.",
                        "Anopheles population densities are driven by the complex mosquito lifecycle involving multiple gonotrophic cycles in fertilized females, who lay hundreds of eggs following successive blood meals. Each egg batch is fertilized by sperm that is stored by the female for her lifetime following a single insemination event. Many of the processes characterizing this reproductive cycle are regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), a steroid hormone originally studied in insects for its fundamental role in larval molting. Besides an essential function of female-produced 20E in triggering egg development after blood feeding, in Anopheles gambiae as well as in other important anopheline vector species, sexual transfer of this hormone by the male induces a dramatic series of molecular events that culminate in increased oogenesis, induction of egg laying and loss of the female's susceptibility to further mating."

                        "Reference will now be made in detail to certain embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. While the disclosed subject matter will be described in conjunction with the enumerated claims, it will be understood that the exemplified subject matter is not intended to limit the claims to the disclosed subject matter.",
                        "Based on 20E's multiple physiological effects, the inventors have found that 20E non-ecdysteroidal agonists such as dibenzoylhydrazines (DBHs) can be utilized to manipulate reproductive success and other aspects of mosquito biology that are relevant for vectorial capacity. While not being bound by any specific theory, DBH compounds are believed to mimic the action of 20E by competitively binding to the ecdysteroid receptor, resulting in high ecdysteroid activity. Indeed when provided to larvae, DBHs induce precocious and incomplete molting, leading to death by starvation and desiccation. However, their potential use against adult mosquito stages, those responsible for parasite transmission, has never been tested.",
                        "The inventors have shown, for example, that topical application of the DBH compound methoxyfenozide significantly limits the reproductive success of adult An. gambiae females and greatly increases their mortality. Moreover they show that methoxyfenozide impairs the development of Plasmodium parasites in the Anopheles mosquito. In addition, the inventors have incorporated their experimental findings into a mathematical model of the mosquito life cycle to determine the potential impact of the compound on mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. They predict that application of DBH in impregnated bed nets or in indoor spray programs would significantly reduce malaria transmission. In their model DBH treatment achieves comparable results to the use of insecticides, and enhances insecticide effectiveness when used in combination, regardless of the level of coverage. They also predict that the impact of DBH on malaria transmission is primarily due to a shift in the mosquito age distribution, such that even when there are a similar number of adult females in the population, the older females capable of transmitting malaria are rare. The use of these steroid hormone agonists against Anopheles mosquitoes therefore provides a new strategy for malaria control.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention are therefore directed to a method for at least one of substantially reducing Plasmodium and/or oocyst development, substantially reducing mating success, substantially abolishing egg development after blood feeding, and substantially reducing the mean survival rate of adult, female mosquitoes. The method comprises contacting the adult, female mosquitoes with a composition comprising an effective amount of one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially reducing Plasmodium and/or oocyst development\u201d generally refers to reducing the number of oocysts per midgut of adult, female mosquitoes by about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 97%, about 99%, about 100% or from about 50% to about 100% (e.g., from about 60% to about 90%, about 70% to about 99%, about 80% to about 100% or about 90% to about 100%) relative to a control (e.g., methoxyfenozide relative to acetone). An \u201ceffective amount of one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists\u201d is one that achieves these reductions.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially reducing mating success\u201d generally refers to reducing the ratio of the percentages of \u201cmated\u201d to \u201cnot mated\u201d adult, female mosquitoes from about 7 to about 0.1 (e.g., about 7 to about 0.4, about 6 to about 0.5, about 5 to about 0.4 or about 4 to about 0.4) relative to control (e.g., no DBH relative to DBH). An \u201ceffective amount of one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists\u201d is one that achieves these reductions. As used herein, the term \u201cmated\u201d includes females that become inseminated during mating and females that, for one reason or another, (e.g., females exposed to DBH treatment) do not become inseminated, even though they have mated.",
                        "For example, in a control group, the percentages of mated to not mated adult, female mosquitoes might be 86% and 14%, respectively. And in the DBH group, the percentages of mated to not mated adult, female mosquitoes might be 29% and 71%, respectively. The ratio of the percentages of mated to not mated adult, female mosquitoes in the control group is therefore about 6. And the ratio of the percentages of mated to not mated adult, female mosquitoes in the DBH group is about 0.4. The ratio of the percentages of mated to not mated adult, female mosquitoes has therefore been reduced from about 6 to about 0.4 in the DBH group, relative to the control group.",
                        "In some embodiments, the substantially reducing mating success comprises a substantial reduction in number of eggs produced by the adult, female mosquitoes or a substantial reduction in the success of insemination of the adult, female mosquitoes.",

                                "Current malaria control and elimination programs are severely jeopardized by emerging resistance to insecticides and drugs, a lack of an effective vaccine, and a paucity of tools for mosquito control. Development of active compounds targeting the mosquito vector with novel modes of action that can be safely employed alone or together with insecticides will be essential for achieving malaria elimination goals. Informed by empirical findings described herein of the multiple effects of the 20E agonist DBH on mosquito reproduction and lifespan, the model discussed herein shows that effective malaria control and elimination can be achieved when DBH is used alone and in combination with insecticides, regardless of the mode of application. This combined synergistic effect allows for dramatic transmission reduction even at very low insecticide efficacies, a particularly relevant finding considering the degree of insecticide resistance emerging in natural mosquito populations. Moreover, when DBH application occurs at low coverage malaria elimination can be achieved whilst maintaining mosquito populations, thus minimizing the impact of DBH on ecosystem stability.",
                                "A striking impact of DBH was observed on insemination rates, egg development, and adult female longevity in experimental applications. These results are in agreement with studies linking high 20E activity to premature aging and apoptosis of ovarian follicles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and to the loss of mating receptivity observed in An. gambiae females receiving male 20E during copulation. Interestingly, recent studies targeting another insect hormone, the sesquiterpene juvenile hormone, have shown life shortening and sterilizing activity against adult Anopheles species. Pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone analog is currently being tested in LLINs for its combined efficacy with insecticides. Upon optimization and testing of DBH tarsal uptake, alternating the use of DBH and pyriproxyfen alone or in combination with insecticides may provide the key to reducing infectious mosquito numbers while preventing the spread of resistance mechanisms in the population.",
                                "As DBH is not toxic to mammals unless used at extremely high concentrations and is non-carcinogenic, this compound is suitable for bed net-based strategies where low toxicity is an essential requisite, and could represent an effective alternative to the only insecticides currently used on LLINs, namely, pyrethroids. Importantly, given the multiple essential roles of the steroid hormone 20E during larval development and adult life, emergence of resistance mechanisms to DBH may be costly for the mosquito. Although instances of oxidative metabolism of DBH compounds have been observed in Lepidopteran larvae, cross-resistance to other insecticide groups has not been reported. Moreover, selective pressures may be partially relieved or completely lifted by using DBH compounds in rotation, mosaics or combination with insecticides, as these have completely different modes of action. Given the conserved role of 20E in regulating female physiology in multiple anopheline species, it is expected that DBH will be effective against effective malaria vectors such as An. arabiensis, An. funestus and An. stephensi. DBH-based approaches may therefore be pivotal for successful malaria control in Africa and other regions of the world affected by this disease."

Upon emerging as adults, females rest before either mating or feeding, and those who feed as virgins but do not encounter DBH, subsequently mate.

As 20E injections in virgin females completely abolish insemination in a number of Anopheles species, it was reasoned that topical application of DBH to the female's thorax might achieve the same result. Moreover, although 20E is essential for egg development, levels above a critical threshold can induce apoptosis of ovarian follicles and this effect may be recapitulated by DBH treatment.

Only 29% of females treated once with DBH were successfully inseminated by males, as determined by the presence of sperm in the spermatheca, compared to 86% of controls (Fisher's exact text, p<0.0001). Furthermore, egg development was completely abolished in these females after blood feeding, whereas oogenesis was fully successful in controls (Fisher's exact text, p<0.0001). Finally, DBH-treated females showed significantly increased mortality, with a median survival time of 8 days and nearly 100% mortality over 14 days, compared to only 10% mortality detected in controls over the same period (Log-rank test, p<0.0001). These combined effects demonstrate a strong impact of DBH application on mosquito survival and reproductive success, with possible consequences for malaria transmission.",

                                "Egg laying, mating, and lifespan were all significantly altered in a DBH dose-dependent manner. Mated females were tested for their ability to develop and lay eggs when exposed to DBH 24 hours prior to blood feeding at 5 different doses ranging in a 2-fold dilution series from about 2 \u03bcg to about 0.125 \u03bcg per mosquito, respectively. One hundred percent (100%) of the control females oviposited after a blood meal. Females exposed to DBH showed a dose-dependent reduction in oviposition, with 47.4% of individuals laying eggs at the median dose (0.5 \u03bcg) and only 10.9% at the highest dose (2 \u03bcg). An ED50 dose of 0.5 \u03bcg (0.08-0.13 95% CI) was determined from the dose-response curve (slope of 2.32, R=0.993). Moreover, even in cases where females oviposited, a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid was detected at the three highest doses (e.g., 2 \u03bcg; 1 \u03bcg; and 0.5 \u03bcg), with a median egg number of zero compared to a median of 91.5 eggs in the control group. Upon dissection of individuals in all DBH-exposed groups, 98.7% of females were found to have no eggs developed in the ovaries despite fully engorging on blood.",
                                "While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, these results appear to demonstrate that the reduction in oviposition rates may be due to impaired oogenesis. Induction of autogenous egg development after exposure was not observed. Microscopic analysis of ovaries after terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays detected extensive fragmentation of chromatin, indicative of apoptosis, limited to the primary ovarian follicles of treated females 24 hours after DBH exposure, while control females had no observable apoptosis and had otherwise normal follicular morphology. Similar apoptotic follicles were observed after 20E injections, showing that the phenotype induced by DBH application recapitulates the effects induced by 20E.",
                                "Mating and female longevity were also significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls as a result of DBH exposure. After treating virgin females with 3 DBH doses (2 \u03bcg (high), 0.5 \u03bcg (median), and 0.125 \u03bcg (low), corresponding to approximately ED90, ED50 and ED10)) and placing them with males for 2 days, a 65-25% reduction in insemination rates, as determined by the presence of sperm in the spermatheca was observed.",
                                "In addition, DBH-treated females showed an eight-day reduction in median survival time at the highest dose compared to controls (median survival time in 2 \u03bcg DBH: 11 days; Control: 19 days), and lifespan was reduced even at the lowest dose (median survival time in 0.125 \u03bcg DBH: 16 days). P. falciparum prevalence (NF54 strain) was significantly reduced 7 days post-infectious blood meal at the two higher DBH doses relative to the control. At the highest dose (2 \u03bcg), only 7.5% of females who fully engorged on an infectious blood meal were positive for oocysts, corresponding to an 87% reduction in infection prevalence relative to controls. When using the median dose (0.5 \u03bcg), 25.8% of females failed to develop an infection, providing a 56% reduction in prevalence. Limited effects were observed in the low dose treatment group (0.125 \u03bcg), where oocyst prevalence (50.7%) was similar to the control group (58.5%). In those females that developed oocysts, the intensity of infection was not significantly affected. While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, these results appear to demonstrate a strong, dose-dependent effect of DBH on four important determinants of vectorial capacity which in turn may be an indication that DBH exposure affects adult, female mosquitoes in a predictable and reproducible manner.",
                                "Modeling the Impact of DBH on Mosquito Populations Predicts a Dramatic Shift Towards Younger Females",
                                "A discrete-time deterministic mathematical model of the mosquito life cycle was developed to predict the impact of DBH on Anopheles population dynamics. Individual mosquitoes were modeled through their life cycle, starting with the development of juvenile aquatic stages (eggs and larvae), followed by mating and four gonotrophic cycles consisting of feeding, resting and ovipositing. Experimental findings were used to define the efficacy of DBH and included the three effects of DBH in the model as follows: reduced mating success (67% reduction, with 68% CI of 58-73% reduction), impaired egg development (98% reduction, with 68% CI of 94-99% reduction), and enhanced daily mortality rate (with maximum 60% increase in mortality at day 8 post exposure, with 68% CI of 37-72% increased mortality).",
                                "The impact of DBH was explicitly modeled on its own, either delivered via DBH-impregnated bed nets to target females as they attempt to blood feed, or in DBH indoor sprays to target females as they rest after feeding. In addition, the application of DBH was considered in combination with insecticides, to examine the possible synergistic impact of incorporating DBH in LLINs or IRS in both high (with 65% malaria prevalence pre-intervention) and low (with 5% malaria prevalence pre-intervention) transmission settings. Varying levels of coverage were examined, e.g., the percentage of the human population protected by DBH and/or insecticide, as 100% coverage is unlikely to be achieved in most field settings due to factors such as isolation of human populations and lack of resources. A single well-mixed mosquito population without spatial structure was used to quantitatively examine the relative efficacy and general mechanisms of transmission reduction following a DBH-based intervention.",
                                "The modeled mosquito population and its composition were significantly altered under the application of DBH. The total adult mosquito population increased at low coverage, driven by reduced density-dependent larval mortality, but coverage above 30% resulted in a dramatic decrease in population size due to increased adult mortality and reduced egg batch sizes, with extinction occurring above 50% coverage. This non-linear relationship between DBH coverage and adult population size was accompanied by a dramatic shift in the age distribution of adult females towards younger individuals. Importantly, even when adult mosquito populations increased, as in the case of DBH coverage below 30%, the relative proportion of adults that could potentially transmit malaria (females over 12 days old) was reduced at all levels of coverage compared to no intervention. This maintenance of overall mosquito numbers at low coverage may minimize the ecological impact of DBH.",
                                "When DBH was applied in combination with insecticide, adult mosquito populations were rapidly driven to extinction even at coverage as low as 35%. Exposure through indoor spraying showed similar effects on the mosquito population including the age shift of the population. To determine how each individual effect produced by DBH exposure (e.g., mating success, egg development and mortality) alters the mosquito population, these effects were also considered independently in the model.",
                                "DBH is Predicted to Achieve Malaria Elimination Alone or in Combination with Insecticides",
                                "The mathematical framework was extended to include malaria transmission and feedback between infectious human and mosquito populations to estimate the impact of DBH on malaria. For simplicity, the human population using a susceptible-infectious framework was modeled. Mosquitoes could acquire infection upon feeding, and required 12 days to become infectious to humans. The reduction in adult population size due to DBH exposure, coupled with the predicted decline in older adult mosquitoes, dramatically reduced the prevalence of malaria. DBH alone had a similar impact to insecticide in the model described herein, with elimination being achieved when coverage was above 40%. In combination with insecticide, however, even modest bed net coverage of 25% led to elimination. Furthermore, elimination was more frequently attained, and was achieved more rapidly, when DBH and insecticides were used in combination. Similar dynamics were observed when modeling DBH use in indoor sprays. How each individual effect of DBH altered malaria prevalence when applied via bed nets was also examined. In low transmission settings, elimination was achieved at any coverage above 15%.",
                                "Equilibrium prevalence and time to elimination were affected at varying levels of coverage and for different degrees of DBH and insecticide efficacy. DBH alone had a similar impact as insecticide on malaria transmission. However, DBH in combination with even weakly effective insecticides (as low as 10% efficacy) and at relatively low coverage of bed nets (as low as 40%) were sufficient to eliminate malaria using the empirically determined DBH efficacy. With a coverage above 50%, malaria was predicted to be driven to elimination within six months regardless of the insecticide efficacy and method of application. A well-mixed, simple model was used in order to examine the relative efficacy of interventions. In the field, spatial heterogeneities are expected and multitude of mosquito species to play an important role in determining the precise outcome of control programs."

        "1. A method for at least one of substantially reducing Plasmodium and/or oocyst development, substantially reducing mating success, substantially abolishing egg development after blood feeding, and substantially reducing the mean survival rate of adult, female mosquitoes, the method comprising:\ncontacting the adult, female mosquitoes with a composition comprising an effective amount of one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists.",
        "2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists is at least one diacylhydrazine derivative non-steroidal ecdysone agonist.",
        "3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonist is at least one of halofenozide, methoxyfenozide, tebufenozide, chromafenozide, fufenozide, RH5849, and KU-106.",
        "4. The method of claim 1, wherein the contacting comprises topical contacting.",
        "5. The method of claim 4, wherein the topical contacting comprises tarsal contact.",
        "6. The method of claim 5, wherein the tarsal contact comprises tarsal absorption of the one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists.",
        "7. The method of claim 1, wherein the adult, female mosquitoes comprise Anopheles spp, Aedes spp or Culex spp.",
        "8. The method of claim 1, wherein the substantially reducing mating success comprises a substantial reduction in number of eggs produced by the adult, female mosquitoes or a substantial reduction in the success of insemination of the adult, female mosquitoes.",
        "9. The method of claim 1, wherein the composition comprising an effective amount of one or more non-steroidal ecdysone agonists further comprises an insecticide that is not a non-steroidal ecdysone agonist.",
        "10. The method of claim 9, wherein the insecticide is pyrethroid, a carbamate, an organophosphate or a juvenile hormone analog.",
        "11. The method of claim 10, wherein the insecticide comprises permethrin, bendiocarb, pirimiphos-methyl, pyriproxyfen or combinations thereof.",
