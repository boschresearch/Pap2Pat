                        "As such a plasma actuator, a sheet plasma actuator illustrated in FIG. 40 is typically known, for example. In this actuator, a front surface electrode 52 and a back surface electrode 53 are provided on the respective surfaces of a plate insulating body 51, which is made of a resin, a ceramic or the like and serves as a dielectric, such that the insulating body 51 is sandwiched between the front surface electrode 52 and the back surface electrode 53. When the front surface electrode 52 and the back surface electrode 53 are connected to an AC power source 54 and an AC electric field is generated, the plasma actuator generates a plasma jet 56 from an edge 55 of the front surface electrode 52 along the front surface of the insulating body 51.",
                        "The thus-generated surface plasma guides the neighboring gas to generate an induced gas flow 57. Accordingly, studies have been made to effectively apply the effects thereof in controlling the lifting power of wings and the like.",
                        "According to an exemplary study, as illustrated in FIG. 40(d), a surface plasma generator 59 as described above is provided on a front surface of a wing 58 at a position where the air flow tends to be separated from the wing surface. In the example illustrated in the same drawing, upper electrodes 52 are linearly aligned on the front surface of the wing.",
                        "The surface plasma generator 59 in use generates surface plasma from the edges 55 of the front surface electrodes 52 in accordance with the principle described above, and a plasma jet is generated. The generated plasma jet affects the gas flow flowing around the front surface of the wing 58 in accordance with the principle of the induced gas flow generation, and thus can prevent the separation of the gas flow which tends to take place at this position.",
                        "In particular, the surface plasma generator, which does not include any mechanical operative portions, is hardly damaged, and thus can be stably operated for a long time.",
                        "As described above, the plasma actuator is employed as a device for preventing the separation of the wing surface gas flow. In addition, in view of the characteristics of the plasma actuator, such as a characteristic that no operative portions are included and a characteristic that the plasma actuator is small and light-weight, the plasma actuator has been developed for preventing the separation or turbulence in various apparatus using fluid flow, or as a propulsion source for flight vehicles for flying through outer space.",
                        "Particularly as illustrated in FIG. 40(a), in the plasma actuator, the AC power source 54 can be controlled by a controller 60. Further, a sensor 61 detects the gas speed or the temperature. Based on the detection signal, the controller 60 controls the AC power source 94. By this operation, the plasma actuator generates the surface plasma corresponding to the conditions at this time.",
                        "According to the example illustrated in FIG. 40(b), at this time, an AC pulse is output as the control signal for 1/15 second. Then, after the pausing of 13/30 second, the same AC pulse is output. By conducting a duty ratio control to increase the pulse supply time as illustrated in FIG. 40(c), a stronger plasma jet is generated and a faster induced gas flow is generated around the plasma jet.",
                        "Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique to stably generate surface plasma of high speed by suitably setting the rising steed of a voltage applied to electrodes of a plasma actuator. Patent Literature 2 discloses a plasma actuator stably operable even under high temperature environment. Patent Literature 3 discloses a technique to apply a plasma actuator to an ozone generator. Patent Literature 4 discloses a technique to apply a plasma actuator to an anti-icing device.",
                        "In addition, Patent Literature 5 mentioned below discloses that the generation of a noise gas flow is reduced by accommodating primary components of a pantograph in a collector shoe shaped like a hollow box. Further, Patent Literature 6 mentioned below discloses that the generation of a noise gas flow is reduced by covering an arm of a pantograph with a cover.",
                        "Patent Literature 7 mentioned below discloses that a blade is protected from high temperature by injecting compressed air from an end of a turbine blade toward a tip clearance, and that the optimum tip clearance is maintained by providing a plate configured to reduce a tip clearance vortex.",
                        "Non-Patent Literature 1 mentioned below discloses the effects obtained by providing a plasma actuator to a distal end of a turbine blade lattice, by means of visualizing the flow within the tip clearance and measuring the pressure at the outlet of the blade lattice. According to this literature, the plasma actuator suppresses the generation of leakage vortex and reduces the loss by 9% at maximum."

                                "As described above, the sheet plasma actuator, in which the plate-shaped upper electrode 52 and the plate-shaped lower electrode 53 are provided to sandwich the plate-shaped insulator 51 therebetween, has adequate rigidity with three plates layered on one another. Therefore, when such a sheet plasma actuator is applied to a three dimensional curved surface such as a turbine blade of a gas turbine or a windmill, folds or unevenness is generated by twist, which may lead to a turbulence of gas flow. Accordingly, the desired effect of the plasma actuator cannot be obtained.",
                                "In addition, the three plates layered on one another occupy certain thickness and area, and thus may affect the high speed flow at a large area. This may cause the air resistance against the gas flow flowing around the wing front surface, and may lead to a turbulence of the gas flow. Thus, the sheet plasma actuator may be peeled off.",
                                "In order to solve the above problem, by cutting out only the neighborhood of the electrodes of the sheet plasma actuator, and attaching the same only to desired positions, the sheet plasma actuator can be applied to a three dimensional surface while avoiding the generation of folds or unevenness to some extent.",
                                "However, when the distance between the front surface electrode and the back surface electrode is not sufficiently maintained, short circuit may be caused due to creeping discharge. Therefore, while the insulating layer needs to be kept as wide as possible, the shortest distance between the electrodes needs to be kept as great as possible.",
                                "Even when the plasma actuator is used in typical dry air, i.e., in an environment where a short circuit is not likely to be caused, a short circuit may be caused easily particularly if the air is mixed with water drops or charged particles. Since ions are generated from the plasma actuator itself, a path to the back surface electrode may be created due to creeping discharge and cause a short circuit.",
                                "Further, when a casing upon which the sheet plasma actuator is disposed is made of an insulating material, the safety is secured by grounding the front surface electrode and applying the higher voltage onto the back surface electrode. At this time, in order to prevent the above creeping discharge, the casing needs to be covered with an insulating layer as much as possible. As a result, the weight of the sheet plasma actuator is increased.",
                                "When the casing upon which the sheet plasma actuator is disposed is made of a conductive material, i.e., the grounding casing is made of a conductive material (metal), the arc problem takes place more easily. When a high-voltage high-frequency signal is input onto the front surface electrode while the back surface electrode is grounded, the risk of short circuit is greatly increased due to charged particles and water drops (rain) unless the surface is covered with an insulating layer.",
                                "By grounding the front surface electrode and the casing, the safety is improved to some degree. However, the back surface electrode is required to be reliably kept insulated from the casing. Accordingly, an additional insulating layer is required to interpose between the casing and the back surface electrode. This insulating layer is required to be thickened in accordance with the required insulation. The weight is accordingly increased, and the adverse effect thereof on the gas flow is further increased.",
                                "In addition, when the casing is made of a conductive material, the entirety of the casing is grounded. Therefore, it becomes difficult to induce the plasma only from one side of the front surface electrode. Thus, further improvement is necessary for the inducement of a unidirectional jet flow. Besides, since the back surface electrode is positioned closely to the casing, the electric capacitance is increased even in wiring portions where no plasma is generated.",
                                "In order to prevent the short circuit from the back surface electrode, the surface of the sheet plasma actuator needs to be strongly attached and sealed to the casing. At this time, wiring to supply power to the sheet plasma actuator is required, and the insulating of the end surfaces at that position is also required.",
                                "Furthermore, by applying the plasma actuator to a heat exchanger or the like, the heat transmissibility is enhanced due to the prevention of the separation and the acceleration of the fluid mixture (acceleration of turbulent flow). However, by attaching the sheet plasma actuator to the heat exchanger, the heat exchange portion may be covered with the sheet plasma actuator, which deteriorates the heat exchange efficiency. Therefore, the application of the sheet plasma actuator may conversely deteriorate the performance of the heat exchanger.",
                                "The application of the sheet plasma actuator to a blade of a gas turbine may also become a hindrance to a cooler mechanism of the turbine and the like. In addition, the attachment of the sheet plasma actuator to the blade may change the shape of the blade, which is not favorable.",
                                "In order to flush mount the sheet plasma actuator by providing the casing with a recess or by other method for preventing such a problem, the front surface electrode requires wiring on its back side. Such wiring may lead to a local generation of turbulence.",
                                "When the sheet plasma actuator is attached to the entire wing surface, by covering the entire casing forming the wing with the sheet, the safety against the short circuit is enhanced while the curvature of the wing is maintained. However, the shape thereof is changed due to the sheet thickness. Further, even when the sheet plasma actuator is locally damaged, the entire sheet needs to be replaced. Therefore, it is not practically feasible to attach the sheet to the entire blade.",
                                "On the other hand, in an automobile having a stepped portion that is stepped down vertically with respect to the air flow generated during the travelling of the automobile, such as a truck having a cab whose back end is formed as a vertical wall, the air flow is separated from the stepped portion at a rear position. A low speed area is formed at a rear surface of the stepped portion, and a low pressure region where the pressure is lower than the stagnation point pressure of the automobile front side is formed.",
                                "The pressure difference generates a pressure drag (or a form drag) on the vehicle body, and the fuel efficiency is deteriorated.",
                                "Further, on the rear side of the stepped portion, a vibration flow of a large scale is generated. Such vibration flow, which may cause the vehicle body to wobble, not only adversely affects the stable travelling of the automobile, but also deteriorates the fuel efficiency like the pressure drag because such vibration flow generates a drag (induced drag) due to the vortex generation.",
                                "Accordingly, in order to effectively enhance the aerodynamic characteristics and environmental characteristics of the vehicle body, the low pressure region formed at the rear face of the stepped portion needs to be reduced, and the downstream vibration needs to be suppressed.",
                                "In order to realize the above, the plasma actuator is prominently effective. However, for reducing the low speed region and the vibration flow, the jet needs to be introduced in the flowing direction or the vertical direction near an electrode of the stepped portion. The plasma actuator needs to be disposed at the stepped portion, i.e., a rear end corner of a cab top plate in case of a truck.",
                                "Accordingly, the sheet plasma actuator needs to be bent to be attached to the rear end corner of the cab top plate. Therefore, the plate-shaped insulating body may be damaged to generate a dielectric breakdown. In addition, the insulating body may be easily damaged due to the vibration during the travelling.",
                                "In a current collector (pantograph) of a rapid train, the air flow is separated at the rear side of the collector shoe and a columnar arm configured to raise the collector shoe to bring the collector shoe into contact with the overhead wire, and the vibration flow and Karman vortex are generated. This phenomenon becomes more prominent when the train travels more rapidly, and the noise is increased. Accordingly, if the vibration flow and the Karman vortex are suppressed, the noise is greatly reducible.",
                                "With the above background, an object of the present invention is to enable a plasma actuator to be easily mounted to a three dimensional wing shape such as a wind power generator, aircraft and gas turbine, an outer wall of an automobile such as a truck, and a pantograph of a rapid train, and also to enhance aerodynamic characteristics and energy efficiency and prominently expand the utility of the plasma actuator by enabling the plasma actuator to be disposed exactly at the optimum position without causing folds or the like while minimizing the attaching area."

                                "(2) When the casing to which the wire plasma actuator is attached is made of a metal, the casing itself serves as an electrode to be grounded, and thus the safety is secured. Further, the electrode to which the high voltage is applied is coated with the insulating film in advance. Accordingly, the risk of short circuit is prominently reduced.",
                                "(3) By applying a conductive coating partially to the exterior of the conducting wire coated with the insulating film, or by applying thereto an insulating thin film configured to hinder the plasma generation, a unidirectional flow is generated.",
                                "(4) By using the conducting wire not coated with the insulating film as the front surface electrode separately from the casing, a jet stream is induced at various positions within a three dimensional space, which is applicable to the insulation casing.",
                                "For instance, when a flow is desirably induced only at a single portion, the dielectric barrier discharge can be generated by minimizing the distance between the conducting wire coated with the insulating film and the conducting wire not coated with the insulating film.",
                                "On the other hand, when the inducement of the dielectric barrier discharge and the flow is not desirable, such problem can be solved by increasing the distance between the conducting wires. In addition, since the electrostatic capacity is resultantly reduced, the driving power of the plasma actuator is reduced.",
                                "(5) At an end surface where the conducting wire serving as the electrode to be applied with the high voltage is exposed, a short circuit may be caused. Accordingly, the end surface needs to be insulated. For instance, by applying thereto silicon rubber, insulation coating or resist, the short circuit can be reliably prevented at low cost.",
                                "In a known two dimensional sheet plasma actuator, the end surface corresponds to the length of a cut edge. On the other hand, in the wire plasma actuator according to the aspect of the invention, the area to be insulated is only the cross-sectional area of the conducting wire and the insulating film, which is much smaller than the area in the sheet plasma actuator.",
                                "(6) When the electrode is embedded so as to be flush-mounted, the conductive wire coated with the insulating film, which has a small cross-sectional area, can be easily attached to the casing by providing the casing with a minimum necessary recess. Further, even when the conducting wire is damaged, the replacement is easy. Thus, further cost reduction is made possible."

In this example, the wire plasma actuator according to the aspect of the invention is attached to the conductive metal casing, and the principle of the induced flow generation will be described with reference to a basic configuration example.",
                                "In this example, a collector shoe 15 of a pantograph illustrated in FIG. 22 is made of a conductive metal. The collector shoe 15 is attached with the insulation coated conductor 3 of the wire plasma actuator. In FIG. 22, a railroad vehicle travels rightward.",
                                "A front wall of the collector shoe 15, which is located at the front side in the traveling direction, is provided with the recess 8 (see FIG. 6) at an upper position. The insulation coated conductor 3 is positioned on the inner upper end of the recess 8, and flush-mounted with use of the putty 4 filled in the clearance of the recess 8. A high voltage switch 16, which is connected to one end of the insulation coated conductor 3 and is configured to switch between the high voltage of approximately 20 kV supplied from the overhead wire and the grounded side, is disposed inside the collector shoe 15. The other end of the insulation coated conductor 3 is grounded.",
                                "With this configuration, when the insulation coated conductor 3 is grounded to a rail via a high voltage switch 16, a arm 17, a vehicle body and a vehicle wheel, the surface plasma generates an induced flow to flow in the direction indicated by the arrow.",
                                "It is widely known that, when the railroad vehicle travels at a rapid speed, a vibration flow and Karman vortex are generated in the downstream of the collector shoe 15 due to the separation of the gas flow, and the noise level is proportional to the sixth power of the traveling speed.",
                                "As illustrated in FIG. 12, by generating the induced flow to flow upward from a front edge of the collector shoe 15 in the traveling direction, the gas flow separation can be prevented from occurring in the downstream of the collector shoe 15. Accordingly, the generation of the vibration flow and the Karman vortex can be prevented, and the noise can be reduced.",
                                "As illustrated in FIG. 23, the high voltage switch 16 may be disposed within the vehicle body.",
                                "However, in either configuration, the high voltage switch 16 is required to be reliably insulated from the vehicle body. In this example, only the front wall of the collector shoe 15 at the front side in the traveling direction is embedded with the insulation coated conductor 3. Typically, the railroad vehicle shuttles back and forth at a terminal. Thus, a rear wall of the collector shoe 15, which is located on the left side in the drawing, is also embedded with the insulation coated conductor 3, and switching operation is made in accordance with the traveling direction.",
                                "The voltage applied to the insulation coated conductor 3 is between 20 kV of the overhead wire voltage and the grounding. Alternatively, the overhead wire voltage may be converted such that the voltage of \u00b110 kV is applied to the insulation coated conductor 3.",
                                "The high voltage switch 16 preferably conducts a rapid switching operation with use of a semiconductor device. The high voltage is preferably intermittently applied from the overhead wire to the insulation coated conductor 3 with a drive frequency of approximately 10 to 90% of a basic frequency, which is set, for instance, within the range of 100 Hz to 100 kHz.",
                                "For instance, when the basic frequency is set at 10 kHz and the drive frequency is set at 10% thereof, 1 kHz out of the basic frequency is used for switching to apply the high voltage from the overhead wire to the insulation coated conductor 3 for one second, and then the application of the high voltage from the overhead wire to the insulation coated conductor 3 is suspended with respect to the remainder of 9 kHz. Typically, the higher the basic frequency is, the faster the induced flow becomes, and the higher the ratio of the drive frequency becomes, the stronger the induced flow becomes. However, the higher the basic frequency and the ratio of the drive frequency become, the more the power consumption becomes. Accordingly, the basic frequency and the ratio of the drive frequency are optimally selected in accordance with the size and shape of the collector shoe 15 as well as the maximum traveling speed of the railroad vehicle during the traveling in order to effectively prevent the separation.",
                                "For instance, when the basic frequency is fixed at 10 kHz as described above, the drive frequency may be selected in the range of 55 Hz to 550 Hz if the train traveling speed is 100 km/h, in the range of 110 Hz to 1.1 kHz if the train traveling speed is 200 km/h, and in the range of 165 Hz to 1.7 kHz if the train traveling speed is 300 km/h, because the frequency of the Karman vortex is typically proportional to the speed.",

This configuration can prevent the separation of the gas flow on the entire upper surface of the collector shoe 15, and can stably control the uplifting power.",
                                "At this time, as illustrated in FIG. 10, an induced flow is generated from the upper side to the upper surface of the collector shoe 15 as seen in the axial direction of the insulation coated conductor 3-3, and the induced flow is divided into a right flow and a left flow. When the railroad vehicle travels at fast speed, a flow having a great momentum due to the induced flow is supplied from the upper side to the entire upper surface of the collector shoe 15. By uplifting the fluid having a small momentum near the upper surface, the separation can be effectively prevented.",

                                "The position and range where the separation takes place differ depending on the conditions such as the size and shape of the collector shoe 15 and the maximum traveling speed of the railroad vehicle during the traveling. Therefore, it is effective to optimally position the insulation coated conductors 3-1 to 3-3 in accordance with the simulation based on the design conditions.",
                                "For instance, it may be effective to dispose the insulation coated conductor onto the entire right and left end surfaces of the collector shoe 15 in a zigzag shape like the upper surface of the collector shoe 15, or to generate the induced flow to flow through the bottom side of the collector shoe 15 by attaching the insulation coated conductors to the lower sides of the front and rear end surfaces to extend in the vehicle body width direction of the railroad vehicle. Accordingly, the positioning may be adjusted in accordance with the design conditions. The insulation coated conductor does not require a space. Therefore, the insulation coated conductor may be attached to the upper surface, bottom surface, front and rear end surfaces, and right and left end surfaces of the collector shoe 15, and the optimum insulation coated conductor may be selected in accordance with the design conditions of the vehicle and the vehicle speed.",

This configuration can effectively prevent the separation of the gas flow generated at each end of the arm 17 during the rapid travelling, and also reduce the noise due to the vibration flow and the Karman vertex.",

                                "With this configuration, a strong induced flow is generated between the inner circumference of the casing and the outer end of the blade uniformly in the circumferential direction. Thus, the leakage vortex that is made through the tip clearance is more effectively suppressed.",
                                "In the examples described above, the gas turbine has been mainly described. However, the present invention is applicable not only to the gas turbine, but also to various fluid machines such as a centrifugal compressor and a radial turbine.",
                                "A centrifugal turbo machine such as a centrifugal compressor and a radial turbine is used as an automobile turbo charger and a power generating small gas turbine.",
                                "In such a centrifugal turbo machine, the flow direction is curved from the axis direction to the radial direction, and the diameter of the blade and the casing is changed. Even in such a case, as illustrated in FIG. 39, the pressure loss can be reduced to substantially the same degree as in an axial flow turbo machine, by forming a ring recess on the inner circumference of the casing opposed to the blade outer end and by disposing the insulation coated conductor within the recess.",
                                "In general, the amount of the leakage due to the leakage vortex is increased substantially in proportion to the tip clearance. Therefore, in order to enhance the efficiency of the gas turbine and the like to the maximum, it is required to enhance the design precision of the turbine blade 23 and the bearing as much as possible or to select an expensive material having a small thermal expansion coefficient, which is prominently costly.",
                                "However, the plasma actuator described above is attachable to various fluid machines with prominently low cost. Accordingly, by suppressing the leakage amount due to the leakage vortex to, for instance, approximately one third, sufficient cost effectiveness can be obtained.",
                                "When the casing of the gas turbine is made of an insulating material, the insulation coated conductor 24 may not necessarily be employed, and the conducting wire may be attached to the casing. However, the wing end of the turbine blade 23 is required to be grounded. In particular, when the turbine blade 23 itself is also made of an insulating material, the wing end needs to be attached, for instance, with a conductive metal chip, and grounded via bosses and bearings with use of a conductive wire.",
                                "The wire plasma actuator 25 may be attached not only to the turbine blade 23 rotated by high temperature combustion gas, but also to a compressor. In the example illustrated in FIG. 29, the wire plasma actuator 25 is attached to the inner circumference of the metal casing 21 at a position where the tip clearance is defined with the turbine blade 23."
