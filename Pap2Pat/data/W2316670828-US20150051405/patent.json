                        "Indolic alkaloids are among the natural compounds which comprise a vast series of derivatives, some of which show very interesting pharmacological activity and properties, especially as regards the treatment of tumours or neoplastic pathologies in general. In particular, among the indolic alkaloids with these properties, phidianidine B is a natural molecule recently isolated together with the brominated derivative, phidianidine A, from the opisthobranch mollusk Phidiana militaris (Carbone et al., Organic Letters, 2011, 13(10), 2516-2519), collected in the South China Sea.",
                        "Phidianidines are indolic alkaloids characterized by a 1,2,4-oxadiazol nucleus, a structural element never found in natural marine molecules, and they show an interesting, highly selective anti-proliferative activity on tumour cell lines at extremely low concentrations (nanomolar). In particular, phidianidine B has a high cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell line (uterine cervix cancer).",
                        "Although the 1,2,4-oxadiazol nucleus is extremely rare in nature, there is enormous interest in synthesizing compounds containing this scaffold, since they are extensively used in medicinal chemistry programs as pro-drugs, being metabolically stable and bioavailable compounds. In the literature numerous syntheses of 1,2,4-oxadiazol nuclei have been described (e.g. Pace & Pierro, Org. Biomol. Chem., 2009, 7, 4337-4348 and cited references; Cot\u00e9 et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 2011, 52, 5750-5751; Nishiwaki et al., Org. Biomol. Chem., 2011, 9, 6750-6754; Sanchit et al., IJRAP, 2011, 2, 459-468).",
                        "The majority of the syntheses reported use two principal methods (Scheme A):",
                        "1) dipolar 1,3 cycloaddition of nitriles to nitrile oxides;\n\n2) cyclization of amidoxime derivatives.",
                        "As said above, phidianidine A and B are isolated from a particular type of marine mollusk, which does not, however, enable large quantities of active ingredient to be obtained. It should be noted that the possibility of obtaining natural molecules with high pharmacological potential by chemical synthesis in the laboratory is without a doubt fundamental for gaining access to the high quantities of compound that are necessary for developing studies on biological activity.",
                        "The Applicant has found a new process for the preparation of a series of natural indolic alkaloid derivatives which, advantageously, enables the isolation of the products thereby obtained also in large quantities (in the order of tens of grams). The present process, in fact, comprises the preparation of a 1,2,4-oxadiazol key intermediate which, given its versatility, can be used to obtain a series of derivatives with potential antitumoural activity, including phidianidine A and B.",
                        "Moreover, the reaction for forming the 1,2,4-oxadiazol nucleus according to the present invention is carried out using an amidoxime, in particular a hydroxyguanidine, already containing the protected functional alkylamine group (4). In such a manner it is possible to avoid the problems connected to the subsequent introduction of the alkyl residue on a substrate containing two competing sites (indole NH and oxadiazole NH) as described in the literature."

Examples of suitable organic acids include: maleic, malic, fumaric, ascorbic, succinic and aspartic acid and the like. The employable inorganic acids can instead be selected from the group of: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric acid and the like.

                        "In particular, the starting amino alcohol, in which n is comprised between 1 and 8, is functionalized by halogenation, typically bromination, e.g. with hydrobromic acid, and subsequent protection of the amino nitrogen with a suitable protecting group R, so as to obtain the N-protected compound (2). The protecting group R for the amino nitrogen can be conveniently selected from among the protecting groups commonly used in organic chemistry, e.g.: tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz), and the like (for general reference see \u201cGreen's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d, 4th edition, Peter G. M. Wuts). Preferably, the protecting group is the tert-butoxycarbonyl group (BOC).",

                        "Typically, the starting acid indolic compound undergoes an esterification reaction with an alcohol, in the presence of an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid. Alcohols suitable for this purpose are selected from straight or branched C1-C6 alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the like. Preferably, the alcohol is methanol and the compound (5) is the methyl ester of the corresponding starting acid. Therefore, according to a particularly preferred embodiment, in the compound (5), R\u2032 is methyl and X is hydrogen. Equally preferred is an embodiment wherein in the compound (5), R\u2032 is methyl and X is bromine.",

The reaction solvent is an a polar aprotic solvent. Examples of the solvents that can be used are: dioxane, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF), the latter being particularly preferred. According to a preferred embodiment, the compound (4) is reacted with the compound (5), in the presence of THF as the solvent and NaH as the base. Generally, the selected base is suspended in the selected polar aprotic solvent, and the indolic compound of formula (5), dissolved in a suitable solvent, is initially added to this suspension. The base is used in a molar excess comprised between 1.5 and 3 equivalents over (5) and comprised between 0.1 and 1 equivalents over (4).",
                        "Generally, the compound (5) is dissolved in the same solvent in which the base is suspended, e.g. THF. The mixture comprising the compound (5) and the base is then heated to a temperature above 35\u00b0 C., more preferably to a temperature of at least 40\u00b0 C., even more preferably to a temperature comprised between 50 and 60\u00b0 C., so as to favour the solubilization of the reagents in the reaction environment. After a frame of time, generally comprised between 30 and 60 minutes, the compound (4), previously dissolved in a polar aprotic solvent, e.g. THF, is added to the reaction mixture containing (5), and the solution thus obtained is made to react, typically at the same reaction temperature at which the addition was made, for a variable amount of time which also depends on the quantities and experimental conditions used. By way of example, when the solvent is THF and the addition of (4) to the solution containing (5) and the base is made at a temperature of 50-60\u00b0 C., according to a preferred embodiment, the reaction mixture is maintained at that temperature for a period of time comprised between 1 and 2 hours. On completion of the reaction, the mixture is divided between water and a non-polar organic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, and the organic phase, containing the N-protected compound (7a), is purified using known techniques, e.g. chromatographic purification, thus enabling the compound (7a) to be isolated in pure form and with good yields (greater than 50%).",
                        "The compound (7a) can then be subjected to an N-deprotection reaction by removing the protecting group R to give the compound of formula (7b). The reaction conditions for the deprotection will typically depend on the type of protecting group used. Therefore, in accordance with the known technique, in the case of protection with a BOC group, the compound (7a) is deprotected in an acid environment, e.g. in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), in a non-polar organic solvent such as methylene chloride or the like.",
                        "Advantageously, the present process allows the preparation of a compound of formula (7b), corresponding to the compound of the aforesaid general formula (7) in a free form, i.e. in which R=hydrogen, with good overall yields (greater than 60%) and in a short period of time.",
                        "According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the N-protected compound (7a), preferably N-BOC protected, can also not be isolated from the reaction environment and be directly subjected to a deprotection reaction, thus enabling the compound (7b) to be obtained with a one-pot process according to scheme 3:",

Moreover, the present process makes it possible to form the 1,2,4-oxadiazol nucleus, characteristic of the compounds of the invention, using an amidoxime bearing the protected alkylamine functional group, thus avoiding the subsequent introduction of said alkyl group on a reaction site otherwise containing two competing reaction sites, i.e. indole NH and oxadiazole NH.",
                        "A further advantage of the present invention is the fact that the compound of the general formula (7) can be further functionalized, leading to the formation of a series of final compounds of formula (8), e.g. structural analogues of phidianidine A and B, and thus potentially useful as cytotoxic agents in the treatment of tumours, in particular in the treatment of uterine cervix cancer.",

                        "The amine base is an organic amine base selected from: triethylamine (TEA), diisopropylamine, and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). Preferably, the base is DIPEA. Practically, the amine base and the activated guanylating agent are added at room temperature (i.e. a temperature comprised between 15 and 35\u00b0 C.), generally in equimolar amounts, to the compound (7) previously dissolved in a polar solvent, e.g. anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide. The mixture is then made to react for a variable amount of time, generally longer than 6 hours. The solvent is then evaporated using known techniques, e.g. by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen or distillation, and the residue is purified, for example, using a chromatographic column so as to obtain the compound (8) in pure form and in good yields (>50%).",

The high yields and reproducibility of the synthetic steps, moreover, make the present process also suitable for a possible industrial application. To date, in fact, there are no known processes for preparing alkaloid derivatives such as phidianidine A and B which can be conveniently applied also on a large scale.",
