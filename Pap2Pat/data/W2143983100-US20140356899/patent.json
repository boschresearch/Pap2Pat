                        "The invention relates generally to predictive modeling of biological decontamination effectiveness. In particular, the invention relates to quantitative performance prediction of decontaminating treatments of surfaces exposed to hot humid air.",
                        "Deliberate attacks using pathogens have initiated interest in predictive capability for decontamination effectiveness. Lessons learned following the 2001 anthrax attacks highlighted the need to improve biological decontamination. For example, the three chemical fumigants employed for decontamination (vaporous hydrogen peroxide, paraformaldehyde and chlorine dioxide) were effective sporicides, but damaged many materials (Holwitt et al. 2000; Anon 2003, 2004; Buhr et al. 2011, 2012). As a result, post-decontamination disposal of destroyed materials was complicated (Canter 2005). The cost of decontamination following the 2001 attacks exceeded 300 million US dollars, and the total remediation took 34 months (Buhr et al. 2012).",
                        "Thermal decontamination is a potential chemical-free method of remediation that may be less damaging to materials (Decker et al. 1954; Ehrlich et al. 1970; Holwitt et al. 2000). The combined effect of heat, humidity and pressure in an autoclave is an example of thermal decontamination. Higher temperatures, higher humidity and higher pressures enable reduced sterilization times.",
                        "Previous work examining thermal spore inactivation suggests that low water content (0.6 gram of water per gram of dry protein), dipicolinic acid content and small acid-soluble spore proteins contribute to high heat resistance of spores (Murrell and Scott 1966; Alderton and Snell 1970; Gerhardt and Marquis 1989; Melly et al. 2002; Coleman et al. 2007; Sunde et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010). Spores could have additional mechanisms to resist heat such as expulsion of water from the protoplast as observed in Bacillus stearothermophilus (Prokop and Humphrey 1972). Active water removal may prevent irreversible protein aggregation and shield dry spores from harm, while the hydration achieved with humid conditions may promote irreversible protein aggregation and lead to spore death (Sunde et al. 2009). In addition, protein denaturation of heatlabile metabolic enzymes is also a generally accepted effect of thermal decontamination (Coleman et al. 2007).",
                        "The goals here were to develop test methods and justify a simulant in order to characterize and quantify the efficacy of hot, humid air inactivation of Bacillus spores dried on six different materials. Prior to testing, a spore preparation protocol was developed, useful for both B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam, to eliminate spore preparation methodology as a source of experimental variability. Test methods were developed to control temperature and relative humidity while safely containing spores.",
                        "The experimental design was guided by response surface methodology (RSM) in order to keep the number of tests manageable while producing meaningful data and conclusions. RSM integrates statistical design of experiments (DOE) fundamentals, regression modeling techniques and optimization methods. RSM is an iterative method widely used in industry where the aim is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response (Beauregard et al. 1992; Montgomery 2009; Myers et al. 2009)."

                        "There is a need, therefore, to develop effective decontaminants for biological agents with improved materials compatibility. To this end, test methods were developed to show that hot, humid air effectively inactivates B. anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores with similar kinetics. Spores (>7 logs) of both strains were dried on six different test materials. In particular, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to identify the limits of spore survival at optimal test combinations of temperature (60\u00b0 C., 68\u00b0 C., 77\u00b0 C.), relative humidity (60% HR, 75% HR, 90% HR) and time (1 day, 4 days, 7 days). No spores survived the harshest test run (77\u00b0 C., 90% HR, 7 days), while >6.5 logs of spores survived the mildest test run (60\u00b0 C., 60% HR, 1 day). Spores of both strains inoculated on nylon webbing and polypropylene had greater survival rates at 68\u00b0 C., 75% HR, 4 days than spores on other materials. Electron microscopy showed no obvious physical damage to spores using hot, humid air, which contrasted with pH-adjusted bleach decontamination. Hot, humid air is a potential alternative to conventional chemical decontamination.",
                        "In support of this effort, RSM has been employed using a face-centered cube design (FCD) to describe and predict spore inactivation of Bacillus anthracis \u0394Sterne and B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores after exposure to hot, humid air. For each strain-substrate pair, an attempt was made to fit a first or second order model. All three independent predictor variables (temperature, relative humidity, and time) were significant in the models except for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam on nylon where time was not significant.",
                        "Modeling could not be accomplished for wiring insulation and wet spores, cases with complete spore inactivation in the majority of the experimental space. In cases where a predictive equation could be fit, example response surface plots with time set to four days were generated. The survival of highly purified Bacillus spores can be predicted for most materials tested if given the settings for temperature, relative humidity, and time. Dependence of spore survival and predictability of this survival on material substrate was demonstrated.",
                        "Decontamination of materials, rooms and equipment contaminated with biological agents. This is especially applicable to sensitive equipment and aircraft. There is a need to develop new mild decontaminants with improved materials compatibility compared to existing decontaminants. Conventional operational decontamination procedures can and do destroy many pieces of sensitive equipment, including aircraft. Replacement decontaminants should preferably have properties of materials compatibility, little or no toxicity, little or no reagents, little or no environmental concerns. To this effect, this disclosure provides convenient and simple to use mathematical models based on time, temperature, and relative humidity for evaluation of such decontaminants for various environments.",

The assembly was fitted into a piece of 1.5-inch\u00d72-inch polyvinylchloride and placed through the side port of the environmental chamber using a custom-cut Styrofoam plug 150. This assembly enabled real-time monitoring of temperature and relative humidity inside the conical tube exactly where test coupons would be located. After assembly, temperature and relative humidity were recorded every 5 min and compared to recordings from the built-in environmental chamber sensors. Recordings continued until the hygrometer measurements matched the chamber readings, or until they remained stable for at least 15 min.",

Real-world limitations combined with RSM experimental design were used to select test combinations. The upper limit for temperature and relative humidity was initially set at 82\u00b0 C., 90% relativity humidity, but was adjusted to 77\u00b0 C., 90% relative humidity to comply with limits set by material manufacturers and because unpublished data already showed no spore survival at 82\u00b0 C., 90% relative humidity for 6 hrs.",

A replicate is defined as a substrate within a single test run which was inoculated with spores from an independent spore preparation. For each test run, five replicates of each substrate were inoculated with B. anthracis \u0394Sterne. The column identifies various materials for the substrate. Most of these materials were used to subject dry spores, and polypropylene was also employed for wet spores.",
                        "Quantification of spore survival: After exposure to specified temperature, relative humidity and time, spores were extracted from substrates and quantified for viability using dilution plating on tryptic soy agar (TSA) from Hardy Diagnostics of Santa Maria, Calif. An extraction medium was prepared, in particular: 3% tryptic soy broth (TSB) as T8907 from Fluka in Buchs, Switzerland; 0.25% buffered peptone water (BPW) as 1.07228.0500 from EMD in Darmstadt, Germany; 0.05% Tween 80 at pH 7 as BP338 from Fisher in Pittsburgh. Ten milliliterrs of preheated (37\u00b0 C.) was added to each conical tube with dried spores (polypropylene) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 30 min for spore extraction during the first iteration of testing. During the second iteration, 10 nil of preheated (37\u00b0 C.) extraction medium, including 1% glucose (G5767) from Sigma in St Louis, Mo.; 3% TSB, 0.25% BPW, 0.05% Tween 80 at pH 7, was added to each conical tube and incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 60 min for spore extraction.

Samples were then serially diluted and plated on TSA within 20 min of vortexing. The total time from the addition of extraction medium to plating was <60 min during the first iteration of testing and <90 min during the second iteration of testing. Plates were scored for growth after incubation at 37\u00b12\u00b0 C. for 16\u00b12 hrs. The conical tubes with the remaining 8.8 ml extraction medium, substrates and spores were also incubated at 37\u00b12\u00b0 C. for 16\u00b12 hrs to qualitatively assess the viability of all remaining spores, including those not removed from substrates. If there were no colonies on the plates and no growth in conical tubes, then the survival was scored as zero. If there was growth evident in the conical tube but no colonies observed on the plates, then this was scored as 0.1 CFU ml\u22121 because at least one viable spore had to be present for growth in the 8.8 ml of medium.",

The number of spores extracted from each spore extraction control coupon (i.e., spores dried on substrates and incubated at 22\u00b13\u00b0 C. and ambient relative humidity) was divided by the number from the wet spore controls to calculate spore extraction percentage. The number of surviving spores of colony forming units (CFU) in ml\u22121 from each hot, humid air-treated test substrate was then divided by the extraction percentage to determine the number of surviving spores in CFU m1\u22121. This spore concentration was then multiplied by 10 ml to give a total number of spores surviving (CFU) for each test sample. A log10 transformation of the total surviving spores was performed as log10 (total CFU+1).",

Spore extraction with non-nutrient solutions (0.1% Tween 80 and 1% morpholinopropane-sulfonic acid, pH 7) was highly variable on nylon and InsulFab (data not shown). In order to improve spore extraction efficiency, a nutrient-rich medium was used for spore extraction, similar to products from standardized methods ASTM E2414-05, ASTM E-2197-02, AOAC 966.04 and AOAC 2008.05 (Anon 2002, 2005; Tomasino and Hamilton 2006; Tomasino et al. 2008).

Addition of glucose delayed measurable cell division of B. thuringiensis Al Hakam to 2 hrs after the addition of extraction medium as indicated in view 840 (FIG. 8B) at Table 5.

However, seven logs (7-log or 107) of spores survived on nylon and more than five logs (>5-log or 105) of spores survived on polypropylene (oil-based materials).

The pH-adjusted bleachtreated macrobacillus spores were stripped of exosporia. The outer protein coat was damaged and often stripped as broken shards from the inner coat, which appeared intact. Exosporia and protein coats were less damaged after shorter 1-min treatments with pH-adjusted bleach (data not shown). All pH-adjusted bleach-treated B. atrophaeus spore images revealed gaps at the center of the outer coat, suggesting that the entire coat circumference was degraded at the longitudinal center. Both the inner coat and crust layers appeared intact around the B. atrophaeus spores, although all three outer layers were mostly separated from each other. Spore size measurements supported these observations: B. atrophaeus spore size was unchanged, while macrobacillus spores were smaller after pH-adjusted bleach treatment (Buhr et al. 2008; data not shown).",

Bacillus atrophaeus spore outgrowth was similar to that of B. subtilis (Santo and Doi 1974). Thus, species within the macrobacillus group manifested similar germination/outgrowth morphologies, and these differed from the microbacillus group. The single break in the exosporium and in each coat layer of outgrown B. cereus spores was markedly different than the disintegrated exosporium and broken shards of oxidizer-treated spores. Conversely, the oxidizer-generated gap in B. atrophaeus spores was observed only in the outer coat and appeared at the approximate location where the outer coat disintegrates during outgrowth.",
                        "Test method development represents a critical step towards developing and evaluating future decontaminants. This is especially true for mild technologies such as hot, humid air, where spore inactivation is explored at the limits of the decontamination technology. There has been a need in the current efforts to carefully control and reproduce data from test runs that partially inactivated spore populations. In order to increase data confidence, three test methods were developed: a spore preparation protocol useful for both B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis; a 0.2 \u03bcm filter-cap tube method for both testing of hot, humid air and spore extraction; and a control driven experimental design. The control driven experimental design included 140 substrates (not including sterile coupon controls) per test run. This was greater than ten times the recommended maximum of twelve samples per day for the AOAC 2008.05 decontamination test method (Tomasino et al. 2008; Buhr et al. 2011). The three methods were embedded within a statistical design of experiments, specifically RSM. In addition, spores were characterized by Coulter analysis and electron microscopy.",
                        "This disclosed effort has established test methods and satisfied the requirements for statistical design to show spore inactivation using hot, humid air decontamination. Such method advancements improve confidence in performance data, decrease test time, reduce test costs and support the transition of decontamination technologies from the laboratory to the field. The hot, humid air test methods were developed to translate to biosafety level three (BSL3) testing where safety and security requirements constrain test data output. This is highly applicable because existing and newly proposed regulations concerning possession or use of select agents or toxins limit the types of facilities and personnel that can perform BSL3 work (Anon 2011). The control-driven experimental design included 140 substrates (not including sterile coupon controls) per test run, or greater than ten times the recommended maximum of twelve samples per day for the AOAC 2008.05 decontamination test method (Tomasino et al. 2008).",
                        "The test methods and experimental design permitted the examination of spore inactivation in relationship to five variables: temperature, time, relative humidity, substrate and strain. Temperature, time and relative humidity are the three variables that can be controlled during hot, humid air decontamination. The conditions for those three variables were selected in order to explore the limits of spore inactivation for hot, humid air decontamination. The RSM directed experimental design also required three equally spaced conditions for each of the three decontamination variables. Test conditions were selected such that spore populations would survive the mildest conditions, be partially inactivated at the mid-point conditions and be fully inactivated at the harshest conditions. The data support the selection of the experimental conditions because spores were inactivated within the RSM-directed requirements.",
                        "End-user requirements will dictate the importance of each of the three decontamination variables on hot, humid air decontamination. For example, an end-user of sensitive equipment (electronics, aircraft, etc.) may have a different requirement for decontamination time compared with an end-user of a ground vehicle fleet. The RSM-directed experimental design permits a broad range of end-users to apply hot, humid air decontamination technology as adjustments can be made for the three critical decontamination variables based on the requirements set by the end-user.",
                        "Materials to be decontaminated can also influence the requirements set by an end-user. Spore inactivation on different substrates was significantly different at test conditions that were between the mildest and harshest test runs. The largest number of spores survived on nylon and polypropylene, while the fewest number of spores survived in solution (wet spores) and on wiring insulation. The exosporium is the outer spore structure that imparts hydrophobic characteristics, interacts with materials and likely impacted spore survival on different materials (Doyle et al. 1984; Koshikawa et al. 1989; Husmark and Ronner 1990; Ronner et al. 1990; Charlton et al. 1999; Todd et al. 2003; Redmond et al. 2004; Faille et al. 2002; Henriques and Moran 2007; Ball et al. 2008).",
                        "A hypothesis that may explain the differences in spore survival on different substrates was that porous substrates and hydrophobic, oil-based substrates repel water vapour. Thus, spore survival was highest on nylon because it was porous and hydrophobic, while spore survival on wiring insulation was lowest because this substrate had electrostatic properties. The exclusion of water vapor may have reduced heat transfer to the spores and/or reduced any effects of dissociated water molecules (H3O+ and OH\u2212). These hypothesized effects may be particularly pronounced at higher temperatures because the dissociation constant of water is more than 20-fold greater at 70\u00b0 C. than at 20\u00b0 C. (Fernandez-Prini et al. 2004).",
                        "Selection and justification of simulants is needed to achieve meaningful results and to accumulate sufficient data for confidence in a new technology, particularly for field testing (Buhr et al. 2012). Bacillus thuringiensis offers numerous advantages as a B. anthracis simulant over other candidate species (Greenberg et al. 2010). The Al Hakam strain of B. thuringiensis is genetically closer to B. anthracis than many other B. thuringiensis strains, has a fully sequenced genome and possesses no known toxin genes, and it was the suspected simulant from the Iraqi Al Hakam weapons-of-mass-destruction programme (Radnedge et al. 2003; Challacombe et al. 2007). Bacillus thuringiensis pesticidal strains (e.g., kurstaki) are commercially manufactured to favour the production of entomotoxin (Beegle and Yamamoto 1992; AvignoneRossa and Mignone 1995).",
                        "The crystal toxin, debris and fillers in such preparations vary in type and quantity to create a set of unknown variables that could impact decontamination kinetics and data interpretation. Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam is similar to B. anthracis because neither strain produces crystal toxin during sporulation. Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam spores survived similarly or slightly better than B. anthracis \u0394Sterne spores under the same hot, humid air conditions on the various substrates.",
                        "In total, these data support the justification of B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores as a stimulant, as there is a preference that a simulant be slightly more difficult to inactivate than the agent in order to mitigate the risk of insufficient decontamination. Conversely, the use of B. thuringiensis Al Hakam may be less critical for evaluating more aggressive decontamination technologies. For example, inactivation kinetics for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores were similar to that of B. subtilis spores under the traumatic conditions generated by a shock-wave reaching temperatures above 226\u00b0 C. (McCartt et al. 2011).",
                        "Coulter and TEM analysis showed morphological similarities among macrobacillus spores before decontamination, after decontamination and during spore outgrowth. Spores inactivated with hot, humid air remained intact with no noticeable changes to spore ultra-structure. The analyses revealed no obvious clues regarding the target(s) of hot, humid air. In contrast, morphological damage was seen in the outer layers of spores, particularly macrobacillus spores, after treatment with pH-adjusted bleach. Bleach is known to be a strong oxidizer with general chemical reactivity and high heat is a denaturant. These data support the idea that bleach has pleiotropic effects and damages multiple spore surface targets; that hot, humid air is a mild decontaminant relative to pH-adjusted bleach; and that macrobacillus spores are more appropriate simulants for B. anthracis. Comparison of relevant material surfaces treated with both decontaminants would be required to confirm this assessment for end-users.",
                        "Characterization of spore morphology before decontamination, after decontamination and during spore outgrowth also supports the identification of potential spore targets for both future decontamination development and characterization of the assembly of spore structures. The macrobacillus species show very similar mechanisms of exosporium and coat shedding during outgrowth that is visibly distinct from the microbacilli species (Steichen et al. 2007; Santo and Doi 1974). The morphological damage to the exosporia and outer coat layers of pH-adjusted bleach-treated macrobacillus spores also contrasted with the specific morphological target in the outer coat of B. atrophaeus spores. Despite the differences in the outer layers of spores from macrobacillus and microbacillus species, the inner coat and cortex of all species remained intact.

                        "The single preparation protocol was a necessary step forward to establish B. thuringiensis Al Hakam as a lead simulant for B. anthracis, due to B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores being more difficult to prepare than others, as they tended to clump, presumably due to their hydrophobicity. All spores produced in the Tier II effort are high-purity, laboratory-grade benchmark spores. Eventually, other grades of spores should be tested (e.g., preparations containing dirt, organic debris, or powdering additives) as the presence of debris or additives may affect decontamination kinetics.",
                        "FIGS. 22A and 22B show views 2200 of NSWCDD Coulter profiles of spore preparations for (A) B. anthracis \u0394Sterne as plot 2210 and (B) B. thuringiensis Al Hakam as plot 2220. FIG. 22A shows the plot 2210 with abscissa 2230 as spore particle diameter in \u03bcm and ordinate 2240 as number of spores, with curves 2250 of sample tests reaching a concentration of about 1.2 \u03bcm and a peak number of spores of about two-thousand. FIG. 22B shows the plot 2220 with abscissa 2260 as spore particle diameter in \u03bcm and ordinate 2270 as number of spores, with curves 2280 of sample tests reaching a concentration of about 1.3 \u03bcm diameter with a peak of more than about four-thousand spores.",
                        "The exemplary Hot Humid Air Decontamination Biological Test Design was achieved by environmental test chambers used to control temperature and relative humidity (HR) during testing. Test coupons (2\u00d72 cm) inoculated with 7.1 to 7.8 logs of spores were contained inside 50 mL polypropylene conical tubes capped with 0.2-\u03bcm filter-caps 140. These tubes permitted air exchange while preventing spores from escaping the conical tube and NIST-certified hygrometer/thermometers 170 showed that all temperature and HR targets were reached inside the filtered conical tubes within 40 minutes. Use of these tubes enabled pursuit of a test method with reduced handling of inoculated substrates. Also, a single-step extraction protocol with improved extraction efficiency useful for both strains on all substrates was developed. In the final protocol, spores were incubated in their original conical tubes for 60 minutes in an optimized nutrient-rich medium (1% glucose, 3% tryptic soy broth, 0.25% buffered peptone water, 0.05% Tween 80 at pH 7) prior to extraction via a multi-tube vortexer and plating on tryptic soy agar.",
                        "Also, the post-test conical tubes containing remaining extraction medium, substrates, and spores were incubated to qualitatively assess the viability of all remaining spores, including those not removed from the substrate. This method also introduced the use of wet spore controls. These control samples contained spores that were never dried, and served as the 100% recovery reference values. These data points were used to correct for extraction efficiency from different substrates. Five independent spore preparations for each strain were tested on six different materials: aircraft performance coating (APC), anti-skid, InsulFab, wiring insulation, nylon webbing, and the inside polypropylene surface of the conical test tubes.",
                        "No spores survived the harshest test run (77\u00b0 C., 90% HR, 7 days), while >6.5 logs of spores survived the mildest test run (60\u00b0 C., 60% HR, 1 day). Spores of both strains inoculated on nylon webbing and polypropylene (hydrophobic) had greater survival rates at 68\u00b0 C., 75% HR, 4 days compared to spores inoculated on other materials, particularly the hydrophilic substrate wiring insulation.",
                        "The exemplary Hot Humid Air Decontamination Design of Exerpiments (DOE)\u2014with Response Surface Modeling involves the experimental design for Tier II being guided by statistical design of experiments (DOE), specifically response surface methodology (RSM). The use of RSM permitted the modeling of the response data and therefore generated a predictive capability for each substrate tested. RSM is used to model a process, often with a second order polynomial, in order to understand the process and maximize or minimize the response for certain setting of predictors (Beauregard et al. 1992, Montgomery 2009). The three factors evaluated as predictors were temperature (\u00b0 C.), relative humidity (% HR), and time (days). A three factor face-centered cube test design with two randomized blocks (Phase I and Phase II experiments) was used for this work.",
                        "Under multiple conditions, there was no spore survival. Because the response measured was the average number of surviving spores, the function logit(x) trends toward infinity in cases of no survival, thereby becoming difficult to model mathematically. To alleviate this problem in a way that conservatively estimates the probability of spore inactivation, 0.1+(number of spores tested) was substituted for zero in conditions with no spore survival.",
                        "Significant effects were determined by ANOVA, and first and second order models were either rejected or accepted using the F-test for lack of fit. For observed outliers or overly influential data points, the corresponding run was omitted from further RSM analysis (Montgomery 2009, Myers et al. 2009, Lenth 2009, Hosmer & Lemeshow 2000, Agresti 1996, Agresti 2002). The responses for substrate-spore strain pairs were ultimately modeled using eqn. (1), which includes a blocking term b with coefficient \u03bb and coded variables for the predictors. The indicator variable b was used as a blocking parameter to account for any shift in the mean response that may have occurred between Phases I and II of the experiment. This blocking term is set to b=0 for observations taken in Phase I of the experiment. The blocking term is set to b=1 for observations taken in Phase II of the experiment.",
                        "The arithmetic average of block is usually used for the value of b in practical applications of the equation. These values are provided in view 2300 at Table 32 Average values to Substrate for the blocking variable in FIG. 23. The column 2310 lists substrate material, and the row 2320 identifies the Bacillus strain corresponding to the average blocking term. Alternatively, for blocking coefficient \u03bb>0, b=0 provides a conservative estimate of inactivation and b=1 provides a more optimistic estimate. The reverse is true for strain-substrate pairs where \u03bb<0.",
                        "The coefficients for all strain-substrate pairs are shown in view 2400 at Table 33 Coefficients for Fitted Equations for Average Log Odds of Inactivation in FIG. 24, similar to view 1700 at Table 31, but also including the coefficient \u03bb in the listing. The first array 2410 provides the values for eqn. (1) corresponding to B. anthracia \u0394Sterne for the listed substrate materials. The second array 2420 provides the corresponding values for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam for these materials.",
                        "In all modeled strain-substrate pairs but one, all three predictors (temperature, relative humidity, and time) were significant, and each had an effect on spore inactivation. The exception was B. thuringiensis Al Hakam spores dried onto nylon webbing material, where time was not significant. Interestingly, for B. anthracis \u0394Sterne on two materials (InsulFab and polypropylene), relative humidity was the most significant second order pure quadratic term. In line with the hot humid air decontamination data, the most difficult materials to model were nylon webbing and polypropylene (dried plastic tubes); with a piecewise modeling strategy required for B. thuringiensis Al Hakam on polypropylene. Additionally, nylon was the only material for which multiple runs were omitted based on observation of residual plots.",
                        "For wet spores and those dried onto wiring insulation, the majority of test runs showed complete inactivation and therefore these data sets could not be modeled (coefficients in table are listed as NA, or not applicable). Complete inactivation of wet spores occurred under all conditions except the lowest setting for temperature, with only one exception. For spores of both strains on wiring insulation, all conditions without complete inactivation had two or more predictors at the lowest settings.",
                        "These efforts present the current developments for modeling of pathogen neutralization. The comparative quantification using contour maps enables decontamination procedures to be employed with greater confidence of expectant success.",
                        "While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
