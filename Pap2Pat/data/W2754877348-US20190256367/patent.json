                        "Ammonia is one of the essential chemical substances that has been very widely used for chemical fertilizers, explosives, chemicals, and the like. A production volume of ammonia reaches 160 million tons per year mainly used for chemical fertilizers, and this production volume is still kept on increasing. Although a use of hydrogen as infrastructure has been a recent trend to make low-carbon society reality, storage and transportation of hydrogen is not easy and converting hydrogen to ammonia has thus been a growing trend. In addition to that, ammonia is used in extremely broad areas such as power generation by directly burning ammonia.",
                        "Ammonia as mentioned above is widely produced by the Haber-Bosch process at an industrial level. The Haber-Bosch process is a method for synthesizing ammonia using a doubly promoted iron catalyst through a reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen at 400\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C. under high pressures of 200 atmospheres to 400 atmospheres (see Non Patent Literature 1, for example). However, since the synthesis needs to be performed under high pressures of more than 200 atmospheres, an expensive apparatus capable of providing such a high-pressure condition is required, which therefore increases a production cost.",

According to Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 2, bringing a nitrogen gas in contact with a molten alkali metal causes its nitrogen to change into a nitrogen radical or a nitrogen ion which has an improved reactivity. By making use of this, single crystals of gallium nitride are produced in these literatures. However, studies on a technique of applying the above findings to a field other than the production of the single crystals of gallium nitride have not yet been well conducted."

By doing this, the gases supplied in the form of bubbles are brought in contact with the flowing molten metal and become extremely fine bubbles having the order of nanometers to micrometers (which is hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cfine bubbles\u201d). By forming such fine bubbles, internal pressures of the bubbles are increased and the above-described reaction is promoted. The fine bubbles not only have an increased surface area for reacting with the molten metal, but also remain in the molten metal for a longer time.

Accordingly, ammonia synthesis is further promoted. The gases are preferably supplied under pressure in a range from 1 atmosphere or more to 20 atmospheres or less. Thus, a specific high-pressure equipment that is necessary for the conventional method in which synthesis is performed under high pressures is not required, and thus ammonia can be synthesized at a low cost and in a highly efficient way. The gases are further preferably supplied under pressure in a range from more than 1 atmosphere to 20 atmospheres or less.",

This is particularly effective when the alkali metal is sodium. When the pressure is approximately from more than 1 atmosphere to 20 atmospheres or less, ammonia can be synthesized efficiently even if an upper limit of the temperature is set at 700\u00b0 C. or less. This is because as the pressure increases, the evaporation of sodium is inhibited and decomposition of the synthesized ammonia can be inhibited.",
                        "Accordingly, the heating temperature for the metal in Step S110 and the pressure in Step S120 are preferably set as appropriate within a temperature range from 100\u00b0 C. or higher to 880\u00b0 C. or lower and within a pressure range from 1 atmosphere or more to less than 200 atmospheres, respectively, to inhibit the evaporation of a selected metal and the decomposition of the synthesized ammonia.",
                        "The step of cooling and collecting the generated gas may be further performed subsequent to Step S120. Although ammonia is synthesized in the form of gas, the generated gas contains an unreacted hydrogen gas and/or nitrogen gas in addition to ammonia. When the gas containing these gases is cooled, ammonia is extracted in the form of liquid.",
                        "The step of recovering the evaporated alkali metal and/or the reaction product (specifically, an alkali metal hydride) of the alkali metal and the hydrogen gas may be performed subsequent to Step S120 at the same time as the above collecting step, or separately from the above collecting step. For example, a molten metal is partly vaporized (evaporated) and can be contained in the synthesized gas. However, when the gas is cooled down to about 200\u00b0 C. or less, only a metal component is collected and recovered in the form of liquid by a cold trap or the like. Therefore, the higher purity ammonia can be obtained. The liquid metal and the liquid ammonia have a different specific gravity, and thus can be easily separated from each other without being mixed. The alkali metal hydride is in the form of powder, and thus can be separated by filtration, for example.",

As the metal 201 is described with reference to FIG. 1 as above, a description thereof is omitted.",

The vessel 210 is made of, for example, an inorganic material selected from the group consisting of boron nitride (BN), alumina (Al2O3), calcia (CaO), and yttria (Y2O3), or iron, titanium, chromium, or a metal containing these. These materials have no reactivity or low reactivity with the metal 201. Among the above materials, boron nitride (BN) is preferable as it hardly breaks.",

These heating means are commercially available and easy to obtain, and also capable of heating up to approximately 1000\u00b0 C. to melt at least an alkali metal.",
                        "The vessel 210 can be housed in a high-pressure equipment (not shown) that controls pressures in the vessel 210. This allows the pressure in the vessel 210 to be controlled within the range from 1 atmosphere or more to less than 200 atmospheres, and the ammonia synthesis is therefore further promoted.",
                        "Preferably, the apparatus 200 further includes a stirring means (not shown) for stirring the metal 201 that has been melted by the heating means 220. Examples of the stirring means include a rotary shaker for shaking the vessel 210, a stirring blade or a stirring rod positioned in the molten metal 201, and the like. By stirring the molten metal, a flow is created in the molten metal 201, and the hydrogen gas and the nitrogen gas which are supplied from the gas supplying means 230 become small bubbles, thereby improving efficiency of ammonia production. For example, when the stirring blade is used, the supplying gas can be physically cut with the stirring blade to make it into small bubbles.",
                        "Preferably, the apparatus 200 further includes a bubbling means (not shown) for supplying a hydrogen gas and a nitrogen gas in the form of bubbles. The bubbling means can be used without a particular limitation as long as it is a bubbler that can blow the above-mentioned hydrogen gas and the above-mentioned nitrogen gas out as fine bubbles or a means for further micronizing bubbles of the hydrogen gas and the nitrogen gas, which generated in the molten metal 201. For example, when the bubbling means is a bubbler, the bubbler may be provided in the gas supplying means 230. With such a bubbling means, the hydrogen gas and the nitrogen gas in the form of bubbles are brought in contact with the flowing molten metal 201 and become extremely fine bubbles (fine bubbles) having the order from nanometers to micrometers. By generating such fine bubbles, internal pressures of the bubbles are increased and the above-described reaction is promoted. The fine bubbles not only have an increased surface area for reacting with the molten metal, but also remain in the molten metal for a longer time. Therefore, the overall reaction efficiency is improved.",

For example, a collecting pipe 240 for collecting a synthesized gas is included in FIG. 2. However, the collecting pipe 240 may be connected to a recovery tank (not shown). The synthesized gas contains an unreacted hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, and a vaporized metal in addition to ammonia. The synthesized gas containing the above are cooled in the recovery tank (not shown) and are then subjected to filtration, filtering, or pressurization, as necessary, so that only ammonia can be extracted. The recovered metal and the like may be reused.",
                        "As described above, in the method according to the present invention and the apparatus for synthesizing ammonia according to the present invention, ammonia can be synthesized even under atmospheric pressure by the use of at least an alkali metal as a catalyst without the need for using a specific high-pressure equipment that is necessary for performing the conventional method for synthesizing ammonia under high pressures, thereby reducing a production cost and an apparatus cost. Further, by the use of at least an alkali metal as a catalyst, oxygen and water like impurities easily react with the catalyst, and therefore high-purity ammonia can be synthesized.",

On the other hand, when the temperature was higher than 530\u00b0 C. as in Conditions 3 and 4, a peak of Na was substantially disappeared.

When the temperature was 620\u00b0 C. as in Condition 5 (not shown), an elevation of a Na peak was shown again.
