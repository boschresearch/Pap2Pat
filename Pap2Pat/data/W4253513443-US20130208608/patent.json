    "abstract": "Reconfigurable antennas in an ad-hoc network are provided where all nodes employ MIMO/SIMO/MISO communication techniques. Three types of reconfigurable antennas: Reconfigurable Printed Dipole Array (RPDA), Reconfigurable Circular Patch Antenna (RCPA) and Two-Port Reconfigurable CRLH Leaky Wave Antennas are used. The RPDA, RCPA and the CRLH Leaky Wave antennas have a different number of configurations as well as different degrees of pattern diversity between possible configurations. To effectively use these antennas in a network, the performance of centralized and decentralized antenna configuration selection schemes are quantified for reconfiguration at one or both link ends. The sum capacity of the network is used as a metric to quantify the performance of these antennas in measured and simulated network channels.",

These antennas have been demonstrated to increase channel capacity while reducing the space occupation of the antenna on the communication device. While this previous work has focused on the performance of reconfigurable antennas in single link communications, there has been no published work on implementing and field testing a system that employs reconfigurable antennas in multi-link MIMO/SIMO/MISO ad hoc networks."

The method is used to select an antenna configuration for at least one of the specified multi-element reconfigurable arrays. The antenna configuration is based on changes in the interference in a transmission over a transmission link including the antenna being configured, a transmission rate of the transmitter, a received signal strength of the receiver, an error vector magnitude of the receiver, a channel matrix of the receiver, and/or a packet error rate of the receiver or transmitter. The performance of the system is improved where the processor changes the antenna configuration of only the receiver in response to changes in the measured or estimated levels of the measured values over the transmission link. In the alternative, only the transmitting antenna can have its configuration changed. In this scenario, transmitters of different transmission links are allowed to change only after the levels of the values for the transmission link have adapted to the new antenna configuration at the transmitter of the transmission link. Reconfigurable circular patch antennas, two-port reconfigurable leaky wave antennas and/or reconfigurable printed dipole arrays can be used in MIMO/SIMO/MISO ad-hoc networks.",

The process of measuring and selecting is done for every transmission link in the ad-hoc network to allow every transmitter to respond to the new levels caused by the transmit configuration of the first transmitter in the link. On the other hand, antenna configurations can be done for receivers only in response to changes in measured or estimated levels in the transmission link.",

In an exemplary embodiment, the antenna configuration selection schemes are implemented in software implemented on one or more network processors. In a network scenario, the antenna configuration selection algorithm for a single link not only seeks the configuration combination (i.e., the configuration at the receiver and the configuration at the transmitter) that will provide a \u201crich\u201d channel between the receiver and the transmitter, but will also aim to mitigate the interference that the link is suffering from. This configuration selection process is made more complex by the fact that when the antenna configuration at a transmitter is modified, it changes the interference seen by the other links in the network. While directional antennas can perform interference mitigation by estimating the direction of the incoming signals at the receiver, it may be shown that reconfigurable MIMO/SIMO/MISO antennas can achieve a similar result, with lower system complexity, by only estimating the channel matrix.",
                        "In order to maximize network sum capacity without a centralized controller, a distributed selection algorithm is described below that can be used to efficiently select the antenna configuration at each node. The performance of this distributed selection scheme is compared to that of an ideal centralized approach that uses an exhaustive search process to assign the optimal antenna configuration to every node. It is assumed for both centralized and distributed antenna configuration control that all transmitters make use of the equal power allocation scheme proposed which requires no channel feedback from the receiver to the transmitter.",

As explained below, parameters like the number of antenna configurations, the spatial orthogonality between the array elements, and the level of antenna radiation efficiency can be used to predict the achievable performance with a particular reconfigurable antenna in an ad-hoc network."

A lower correlation coefficient between the two ports will lead to lower correlation between the communication channels from these ports, resulting in higher capacity. Similarly, spatial correlation coefficients relative to radiation patterns generated at the same port for different configurations give an indication of the increment in system diversity achievable using reconfigurable antennas with respect to standard non reconfigurable antenna systems.

Therefore the RCPA allows for higher decorrelation between signals at the receiver and it provides higher system diversity. In contrast, the RPDA allows for switching between double the number of radiation patterns offered by the RCPA. Thus, the RPDA and RCPA can be viewed as representing two different \u201cphilosophies\u201d for using reconfigurable antennas in wireless communications systems: i.) substantial changes in radiation pattern (e.g., RCPA), and ii.) a large number of radiation pattern states (e.g., RPDA).",

The assumption of such locally available channel information is commonly used in ad-hoc networks. Since each link does not have information about other channels in the network, the antenna configuration decision cannot be geared towards maximizing network sum capacity.

However, a change in transmit configuration for a particular link leads to a different amount of interference encountered by the other links. These other links, in turn, will have to respond to this change in interference levels by choosing their antenna configurations to maximize their own capacity. Thus, the Distributed technique is an iterative procedure where each link continually updates its configuration selection in response to changes in the interference. The procedure is very similar to the Iterative Waterfilling algorithm, but instead of using different power allocation matrices to respond to changes in the interference, the nodes will use different antenna configuration combinations. The distributed configuration selection process may also select the antenna configuration using transmission rate, received signal strength, error vector magnitude, channel matrix, and/or error packet rate for the transmission link including the antenna being configured.",

In other words, when a link changes its receive configuration, it affects only its own capacity, while when a link changes its transmit configuration it does not only affect its own capacity but the capacities of all the other links as well. So, in the case of distributed antenna configuration selection, when a link is allowed to change its transmit configuration there is the need for an iterative procedure, so as to allow for the other links to respond to the new interference levels caused by the change in the transmit configuration of one of them. But when only the receive configurations are allowed to change, a change of the configuration in one link will only affect this link and thus it is no longer needed to have iterations.",
                                "Apart from the inherit iterative nature of the configuration selection schemes which also involve changing the transmit configuration, allowing configuration changes in the receive side only has another positive merit: it removes the requirement of having to implement a feed-back loop needed for the receiver to notify the transmitter on which configuration it should be using. These two properties of the configuration selection scheme at the receiver only (not iterative and no need for feed-back) make the RXRA scheme much more appealing for a practical implementation due to its simplicity and its much less overhead.",
                                "The RXRA technique is also desirable in that the Distributed and Centralized schemes become equivalent; when a link maximizes its own capacity by changing reconfigurable antennas only at the receiver, it also maximizes network sum capacity. This is again true via the fact that a change in the receive configuration of a link will only affect the capacity of this link, while leaving the capacities of the rest of the links in the network the same. Distributed and Centralized schemes are not necessarily equivalent when reconfigurable antennas are used at the transmitters of ad-hoc network links as the \u201cselfish\u201d choice that each node makes to maximize its own capacity in the distributed schemes, is no longer guaranteed to have a positive impact on the overall network sum capacity, as it is achieved with the centralized schemes.",
                                "Configuration adaptation at a single side of the link also provides a smaller search space for the Centralized technique and less channel training for the Distributed technique. For example, in the case of RPDAs where there are four configurations available, a link has 16 different configuration combinations to choose from with DSRA. However, this number decreases to four configuration combinations for TXRA and RXRA. This difference in the number of available configurations, while reducing the degrees of freedom the network has, would also require less training. Less channel training may have a positive impact on the performance when the channel estimation errors are taken into account, depending on the total number of configuration combinations that need to be considered.",
                                "When assuming configuration adaptation at only one side of the link, it is still assumed that the other link end uses a reconfigurable antenna, since in an ad-hoc network any node can be either a receiver or a transmitter.

The CDFs of sum capacity resulting from the Distributed configuration selection schemes appear in FIG. 8 for the measurement results and in FIG. 9 for the simulation results. Both the simulation and measurement CDFs show that the increases in sum capacity, as compared to the case where all nodes are equipped with non-reconfigurable Mode 3 circular patch antennas, are considerable. For easier comparison, the expected sum capacity resulting from these CDFs along with the capacity percentage increase of using reconfigurable antennas, are summarized in Table III. From these tables, the measured sum capacity increases are greater than those predicted from the simulations. In particular, for the Centralized DSRA scheme, simulations show an increase of around 50% when using reconfigurable antennas, whereas for the measurements the percentage increase is around 75%. Note that both simulations and measurements show that relatively large sum capacity increases can be expected\u2014the minimum increase is 8:70% for the measured Distributed TXRA case, while for the more appealing Distributed RXRA technique, the percentage increase is 14% for the simulations and 31% for the measurements. The trends in selection technique performance are generally the same for both measured and simulated results.

It is noted that scenarios in which there was no convergence after 10 iterations were not included in the average shown in Table V. However, in both measurements and simulations more than 99% of the scenarios reached convergence before the 10th iteration.",

The corresponding sum capacity CDFs when the configuration selection is performed in a Distributed manner appear in FIG. 12 for the measurements and in FIG. 13(d) for the simulations. In Table IV the expected sum capacities resulting from these CDFs are gathered together with the percentage increase in expected network sum capacity versus the non-reconfigurable case, where all the nodes were equipped with dipoles in the S-S configuration. As in the RCPA results, it can again be seen that the simulations underestimated the performance increase that was observed using the measurement results. However for the RPDA results, the relative performance between the configuration selection schemes is maintained between measurements and simulations, with the Centralized DSRA technique performing the best and the Distributed TXRA technique performing the worst of all techniques using reconfigurable antennas. By comparing these results with the RCPA results in the previous section, it can be seen that in both simulations and measurements, RPDAs provide a larger percentage increase in capacity than RCPAs. Furthermore, it can be seen that the worst to be expected as a percentage increase in sum capacity relative to non-reconfigurable antennas is 10% for the simulated TXRA technique and 30% for the measured TXRA technique. For the desirable Distributed RXRA scheme discussed above, there is a simulated increase in capacity of 24% and an increase of 31% in measured capacity relative to non-reconfigurable antennas.",
                                "2) Convergence Properties: The two iterative configuration selection schemes using RPDAs needed on average more iterations before convergence than the RCPA case, as shown in Table V. This longer convergence time can be attributed to the fact that RPDAs have more configurations to choose from than the RCPAs. The greater number of configurations to choose from also increased the number of scenarios in which there was no convergence after 10 iterations. In particular, for the measurement data, in the Distributed DSRA case, 26% of the scenarios did not converge before 10 iterations. Similarly, in the Distributed TXRA case, 7% of the scenarios did not converge before 10 iterations. While it would certainly have been possible to continue the iterative process until convergence was achieved, the inventors chose to limit the number of iterations to 10 before stopping the configuration update process because a practical system would not have an indefinite amount of time for configuration selection before network information became outdated.",

The performance of a reconfigurable antenna array should be a function of the following factors: i.) the number of configurations available, ii.) the pattern diversity between different configurations and, iii.) the relative efficiency between the different configurations. While the relative radiation efficiency between RPDA and RCPA is important, the normalization process described above effectively sets the efficiency of RPDA configuration S-S equal to RPCA configuration Mode 3. If this normalization had not been performed, a direct comparison between the two architectures would not have been possible, since RPDA efficiency is much higher than that of the RCPA.",
                                "The superior performance of the RPDA, as compared to the RCPA, can be explained by the fact that the RPDA has more configurations available (4 configurations per array as opposed to 2 for the RCPA) and that its configurations are closer to each other in terms of efficiency (i.e., RPDA efficiency varies from 84% to 48% as opposed to the RCPA where the efficiency varies from 21% to 5%). On the other hand, the RCPA does have an advantage in that the radiation patterns of all available configurations show very low correlation (Table II(C)).",

In this case, the inventors were able to gain insight into the importance of having a large number of array configurations. In this situation, the RPDA has as many configuration settings as the RCPA, but with radiation patterns that are highly correlated (Table I(C)). Comparing Table VI with Table IV it can be seen that the percentage capacity increase relative to the non-reconfigurable case was almost halved for both measurements and simulations when the RPDA was restricted in switching only between the S-S and L-L configurations. These results highlight the importance of having a large number of antenna configurations to switch between, even if these configurations have radiation patterns that are relatively highly correlated.",

This result holds true even though the radiation efficiency difference between S-S configuration and L-L configuration is smaller than the radiation efficiency difference between Modes 3 and 4 of the RCPA. This result is due to the smaller correlation that exists between Mode 3 and 4 patterns in the RCPA, as compared to the correlation between S-S and L-L patterns in the RPDA. The effect of uncorrelated patterns will be considered in more detail below.",

In particular, each antenna configuration was normalized separately, so that the maximum expected squared Frobenious norm between the channels with the same configuration combination would be the same. Thus, there are four normalization factors for the \u201creduced\u201d RPDA discussed in the previous sub-section (i.e., one for (S-S)-(S-S), another for (S-S)-(L-L), etc). Similarly, there are four normalization factors for the RCPA (i.e., one for Mode 3-Mode 3, another for Mode 3-Mode 4, etc). In this way, the effects of radiation efficiency were removed, forcing all configuration combinations to \u201creceive\u201d the same power, while keeping the relative channel strengths of the different links in the topology.

The RCPA structure exhibits almost uncorrelated patterns (Table II(C)), while the RPDA configurations are highly correlated (Table I(C)). The calculated expected sum network capacities appear in Table VII.",
                                "From this table, it can be seen that the less correlated patterns that the RCPA offers significantly improves the expected sum capacity. It can also be observed that the capacity values for the RPDA do not change much with this new normalization, unlike the RCPA values, whose mean sum capacity values are significantly improved by forcing both modes to receive the same power. These results show that uncorrelated radiation patterns, as well as the number of configurations and relative radiation efficiency, can be a mechanism through which reconfigurable antennas enhance ad-hoc networks."

The cases where reconfigurable antennas are employed at both link ends, as well as at either the receiver or transmitter have been described and the performance of these cases has been quantified with both a Centralized and Distributed configuration selection scheme. For all of the investigated techniques, the great capacity increases that can be expected by using reconfigurable antennas in a MIMO/MISO/SIMO ad-hoc network have been quantified. Insight into the design of reconfigurable antenna arrays has been provided by quantifying the effects of the number of configurations available, the correlation between different configurations, as well as the effect of radiation efficiency differences between the different configurations. The Distributed technique in which only the receiver is allowed to switch configurations (i.e., RXRA) has been shown to strike a good balance between sum network capacity increases and practical channel feedback and network information constraints."
