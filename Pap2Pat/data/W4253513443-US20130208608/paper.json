    "abstract": "In this paper, we quantify the performance enhancements that can be provided by reconfigurable antennas in an ad hoc network where all nodes employ multiple input multiple output communication techniques. We present two types of reconfigurable antennas: a reconfigurable printed dipole array (RPDA), and a reconfigurable circular patch antenna (RCPA). The RPDA and RCPA have a different number of configurations as well as different degrees of pattern diversity between possible configurations. To effectively use these antennas in a network, we introduce and quantify the performance of centralized and decentralized antenna configuration selection schemes for reconfiguration at one or both link ends. We use the sum capacity of the network as a metric to quantify the performance of these antennas in measured and simulated network channels.",

                "Research in the area of ad hoc networks has yielded important advances, notably in the field of physical layer techniques. In particular, a lot of effort has been spent in (i) applying smart antennas and antenna diversity techniques to ad hoc networks (e.g., [1][2][3]), (ii) developing medium access control protocols suitable for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) ad hoc networks (e. g., [4][5][6]), and (iii) adaptive algorithms for antenna beamforming in ad hoc networks (e.g., [7][8][9]). Directional antennas, like phased arrays [10,11] and switchable parasitic elements antennas [12,13] have been proposed as a solution to reduce the interference of adjacent nodes, maximizing overall network throughput [1,3,14]. In order to further increase the network spectral efficiency, MIMO spatial multiplexing (SM) techniques and diversity techniques have been adopted [4,5,15]. However, directional arrays and MIMO SM/diversity techniques cannot be integrated on compact portable devices, where the limited space available renders mounting multiple directional antennas difficult.",
                "In order to overcome practical space limitations and merge the benefits of MIMO SM/diversity techniques with those of directional antennas, we propose to adopt electrically reconfigurable antennas as a key element of MIMO transceivers in ad hoc networks. These antennas have been demonstrated to increase channel capacity while reducing the space occupation of the antenna on the communication device [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Further, the study that aims to efficiently choose the configuration to be used has started emerging in the literature, like in [23,24]. While these previous studies have focused on the performance of reconfigurable antennas in single link communications, there has been no published study on implementing and field testing a system that employs reconfigurable antennas in multi-link MIMO ad hoc networks.",
                "Through this article, we aim to quantify the benefits achievable with reconfigurable antennas in MIMO ad hoc networks, while also investigating antenna configuration selection schemes at each node. In a network scenario, the antenna configuration selection algorithm for a single link not only seeks the configuration combination of both the configuration at the receiver and the configuration at the transmitter, which will provide a \"richness\", in terms of spatial diversity, channel between the receiver and the transmitter, but will also aim to mitigate the interference that the link is suffering from. This configuration selection process is made more complex by the fact that when the antenna configuration at a transmitter is modified, it changes the interference seen by the other links in the network. While directional antennas can perform interference mitigation by estimating the direction of the incoming signals at the receiver, we show that reconfigurable MIMO antennas can achieve a similar result, with lower system complexity, by only estimating the channel matrix.",
                "In order to maximize network sum capacity without a centralized controller, we propose a distributed selection algorithm that can be used to efficiently select the antenna configuration at each node. The performance of this distributed selection scheme is compared to that of an ideal centralized approach that uses an exhaustive search process to assign the optimal antenna configuration to every node. In this article, we assume, for both the centralized and distributed antenna configuration controls, that all transmitters make use of the equal power allocation scheme proposed in [25], which requires no channel feedback from the receiver to the transmitter.",
                "We determine the sum network capacity that can be achieved with MIMO reconfigurable antennas for different network topologies through channel measurements and electromagnetic ray-tracing simulations conducted in an indoor environment. We consider two prototype electrically reconfigurable antenna architectures in a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system employing SM: (i) a reconfigurable printed dipole array (RPDA) that makes use of two reconfigurable length dipole antennas, and (ii) a reconfigurable circular patch antenna (RCPA) that makes use of a single variable-radius circular patch antenna with two feedpoints. We show that parameters, like the number of antenna configurations, the spatial orthogonality between the array elements and the level of antenna radiation efficiency, can be used to predict the achievable performance with a particular reconfigurable antenna in an ad hoc network.",
                "This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the RPDA and RCPA used as a building block of a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO ad hoc network and compare and contrast the reconfigurable antenna architectures. In Section 3, the system model adopted to evaluate the performance of the reconfigurable antennas in MIMO ad hoc networks is presented. In Section 4, we propose the distributed and centralized antenna configuration selection scheme for MIMO ad hoc networks employing both reconfigurable antennas and the equal power allocation scheme. In Section 5, we describe the network used for both channel simulations and measurements. Section 6 quantifies the results of the centralized and distributed configuration selection algorithms in the measured and simulated 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO ad hoc network. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7."

In particular, the spatial correlation between radiation patterns excited at two different ports of the antenna array gives an indication of the level of decorrelation between the signals collected at the two array elements. A lower correlation coefficient between the two ports will lead to lower correlation between the communication channels from these ports. Similarly, spatial correlation coefficients for radiation patterns generated at the same port for different configurations give an indication of the increment in system diversity achievable using reconfigurable antennas with respect to standard non-reconfigurable antenna systems. The higher the diversity between different configurations, the higher the overall system diversity and the higher the probability of achieving greater channel capacity.",
                "Radiation efficiency is also an important performance measure for reconfigurable antennas. In particular, for a fixed transmitter power, the higher the radiation efficiency, the greater the received signal power and channel capacity. While MIMO channel normalizations sometimes completely remove the effects of antenna radiation efficiency when quantifying the \"richness\" of the multipath channel, this article does consider the relative efficiencies of the reconfigurable antennas when they are placed in different states."

In contrast to the correlation of the radiation patterns created at the different ports, Table 2 shows that the level of diversity between the different configurations generated at the same port is not high (r 1,k,1,m >0.8, [26]) and is much less than that of the RCPA discussed below.",

Therefore, the RCPA allows for higher decorrelation between signals at the receiver and provides higher system diversity. In contrast, the RPDA allows for switching between double the number of radiation patterns offered by the RCPA. Thus, the RPDA and RCPA can be viewed as representing two different \"philosophies\" for using reconfigurable antennas in wireless communications systems: (i) substantial changes in radiation pattern (e.g., RCPA) and (ii) a large number of radiation pattern states (e.g., RPDA).",

Closed-loop algorithms become even more challenging in a network using reconfigurable antennas because knowledge of the interference state of the network would be needed. This interference also depends on the specific antenna configurations used by all the transmitters in the network, and so it would be difficult to keep all the channel and interference estimates current.

Instead, each transmitter performs configuration selection to optimize individual link capacity. Mathematically, link l solves the following optimization problem:",

However, a change in transmit configuration for a particular link leads to a different amount of interference encountered by the other links. These other links, in turn, will have to respond to this change in interference levels by choosing their antenna configurations to maximize their own capacity. Thus, the Distributed technique is an iterative procedure where each link continually updates its configuration selection in response to changes in the interference. The procedure is very similar to the Iterative Waterfilling [32,35] algorithm, but instead of using different power allocation matrices to respond to changes in the interference, the nodes will use different antenna configuration combinations."

Looking at Equation 3, we note that a link's capacity is a function of receive and transmit configurations of it, as well as the transmit configurations of the other links (through the interference plus noise covariance matrix R) that coexist in the network. In other words, when a link changes its receive configuration, it affects only its own capacity, while when a link changes its transmit configuration, it does not only affect its own capacity but also the capacities of all the other links. Therefore, in the case of distributed antenna configuration selection, when a link is allowed to change its transmit configuration (i.e., TXRA and DSRA), there is the need for an iterative procedure, so as to allow for the other links to respond to the new interference levels caused by transmit configuration changes. However, when only the receive configurations are allowed to change (i.e., RXRA), a change of the configuration in one link will affect only this link, and thus iterations are no longer needed.",
                "Apart from the inherent iterative nature of the TXRA and DSRA configuration selection schemes, allowing configuration changes in the receive side only has another positive outcome: it removes the requirement of having to implement a feedback loop from the receiver to the transmitter, which communicates the configuration which it should be using. These two properties make the RXRA scheme much more appealing for a practical implementation because of its simplicity and lower overhead. The RXRA technique is also desirable in that the Distributed and Centralized schemes become equivalent; when a link maximizes its own capacity by changing reconfigurable antennas only at the receiver, it also maximizes network sum capacity. Distributed and Centralized schemes are not necessarily equivalent when reconfigurable antennas are used at the transmitters of ad hoc network links as the \"selfish\" choice that each node makes in a distributed scheme to maximize its own capacity, is no longer guaranteed to have a positive impact on the overall network sum capacity.",
                "Configuration adaptation at a single side of the link also provides a smaller search space for the Centralized technique and less channel training for the Distributed technique. For example, in the case of RPDAs where four configurations are available, a link has 16 different configuration combinations to choose from with DSRA. However, this number decreases to four configuration combinations for TXRA and RXRA. This difference in the number of available configurations, while reducing the degrees of freedom the network has, would also require less training. Less channel training may have a positive impact on the performance when the channel errors are taken into account [21], depending on the total number of configuration combinations that need to be considered.",

Although these modeling deficiencies did not allow for an exact match between measurements and simulations, there was still very good agreement in most of the cases as will be shown in Section 6."

However, when the Distributed TXRA and DSRA techniques did not converge, the iteration count was not included in the calculation of the average number of iterations discussed in Sections 6-A2 and 6-B2.

Both the simulation and measurement CDFs show that the increases in sum capacity, as compared with the case where all nodes are equipped with non-reconfigurable Mode 3 circular patch antennas, are considerable.

In particular, for the Centralized DSRA scheme, simulations show an increase of around 50% when using reconfigurable antennas, whereas for the measurements, the percentage increase is around 75%. Note that both simulations and measurements show that relatively large sum capacity increases can be expected-the minimum increase is 8.70% for the measured Distributed TXRA case, while for the more appealing Distributed RXRA technique (Section 4-C), the percentage increase is 14% for the simulations and 31% for the measurements. The trends in selection technique performance are generally the same for both the measured and simulated results. However, in the Distributed RXRA and TXRA techniques, the trends are   reversed: in the measurements Distributed RXRA outperforms Distributed TXRA, whereas, in simulations, the reverse is true."

The corresponding sum capacity CDFs when the configuration selection is performed in a Distributed manner appear in Figure 5c and 5d for the measurements and for the simulations, respectively. In Table 9, the expected sum capacities resulting from these CDFs are gathered together with the percentage increase in expected network sum capacity versus the non-reconfigurable case, where all the nodes were equipped with dipoles in the S-S configuration. As in the RCPA results, we again see that the simulations underestimated the performance increase that was observed using the measurement results. However, for the RPDA results, the relative performance between the configuration selection schemes is maintained between measurements and simulations, with the Centralized DSRA technique performing the best, and the Distributed TXRA technique performing the worst of all techniques using reconfigurable antennas. By comparing these results with the RCPA results in the previous section, we can see that in both simulations and measurements, RPDAs provide a larger percentage increase in capacity than RCPAs. Furthermore, we can see that the worst we can expect as a percentage increase in sum capacity relative to non-reconfigurable antennas is 10% for the simulated TXRA technique and 30% for the measured TXRA technique. For the desirable Distributed RXRA scheme discussed in Section 4-C, there is a simulated increase in capacity of 24% and an increase of 31% in measured capacity relative to nonreconfigurable antennas."

The greater number of configurations to choose from also increased the number of scenarios in which there was no convergence after 10 iterations.",

For the simulations, all of the scenarios reached convergence (0% did not converge) for both DSRA and TXRA. While it would certainly have been possible to continue the iterative process until convergence was achieved, we chose to limit the number of iterations to 10 before stopping the configuration update process because a practical system would not have an indefinite amount of time for configuration selection before network information became outdated."

The performance of a reconfigurable antenna array should be a function of the following factors: (i) the number of configurations available, (ii) the pattern diversity between different configurations, and (iii) the relative efficiency between the different configurations.",
                "While the relative radiation efficiency between RPDA and RCPA is important, the normalization process, described in Section 5, effectively sets the efficiency of RPDA configuration S-S equal to RPCA configuration Mode 3. If we had not performed this normalization, then a direct comparison between the two architectures would not have been possible, since RPDA efficiency is much higher than that of the RCPA. The superior performance of the RPDA, as compared with the RCPA, can be explained by the fact that the   RPDA has more configurations available (4 configurations per array as opposed to 2 for the RCPA) and that its configurations are closer to each other in terms of efficiency (i.e., RPDA efficiency varies from 84 to 48% as opposed to the RCPA, where the efficiency varies from 21 to 5%). On the other hand, the RCPA does have an advantage in that the radiation patterns of all the available configurations show very low correlation (Table 5)."

In this case, we are able to gain insight into the importance of having a large number of array configurations. In this situation, the RPDA has as many configuration settings as the RCPA, but with radiation patterns that are highly correlated (Table 2). Comparing Table 10 with Table 9 from Section 6-B1, we see that the percentage capacity increase relative to the nonreconfigurable case was almost halved for both measurements and simulations when the RPDA was restricted in switching only between the S-S and L-L configurations. These results highlight the importance of having a large number of antenna configurations to switch between, even if these configurations have radiation patterns that are relatively highly correlated. We can also observe that the RCPA performs better, in absolute numbers, than the RPDA when the RPDA is confined to using only two of the available configurations. This result holds true even though the radiation efficiency difference between S-S configuration and L-L configuration is smaller than the radiation efficiency difference between Modes 3 and 4 of the RCPA. This result is due to the smaller correlation that exists between Mode 3 and 4 patterns in the RCPA, as compared to the correlation between S-S and L-L patterns in the RPDA. The effect of uncorrelated patterns will be considered in more detail in the next section."

In particular, we normalized each antenna configuration separately, so that the maximum expected squared Frobenious norm between the channels with the same configuration combination would be the same. Thus, there are four normalization factors for the \"reduced\" RPDA discussed in the previous sub-section (i.e., one for (S-S)-(S-S), another for (S-S)-(L-L), etc). Similarly, there are four normalization factors for the RCPA (i.e., one for Mode 3-Mode 3, another for Mode 3-Mode 4, etc.). In this way, we removed the effects of radiation efficiency, forcing all configuration combinations to \"receive\" the same power, while keeping the relative channel strengths of the different links in the topology. Mathematically, the normalization parameter for the case where the receiver was using configuration rx and the transmitter was using configuration tx was chosen such that max  |H l r c,i t c | 2 F 4 \u2022 52 for measurements, with the expectation taken along the 40 points.",

In this way, we can compare the performance of two reconfigurable antenna array structures, with each having two configurations available and with all the configurations having the same radiation efficiency. The only difference between the two structures is the correlation between the available configurations. The RCPA structure exhibits almost uncorrelated patterns (Table 5), while the RPDA configurations are highly correlated (Table 2). The calculated expected sum network capacities are shown in Table 11.",
                "From this table, we can observe that the less-correlated patterns that the RCPA offers significantly improves the expected sum capacity. We can also observe that the capacity values for the RPDA do not change much with this new normalization, unlike the RCPA values, whose mean sum capacity values are significantly improved by forcing both modes to receive the same power. These results show that uncorrelated radiation patterns, as well as the number of configurations and relative radiation efficiency, can be a mechanism through which reconfigurable antennas enhance ad hoc networks."

                "In this study, we have studied the performance of two different reconfigurable antenna structures when employed in a MIMO ad hoc network. We have investigated the cases where reconfigurable antennas are employed at both link ends, as well as at either the receiver or transmitter. We quantified the performance of these cases with both a Centralized and Distributed configuration selection scheme. For all of the investigated techniques, we have quantified the great capacity increases that can be expected using reconfigurable antennas in a MIMO ad hoc network. We have also provided insight into the design of reconfigurable antenna arrays, by quantifying the effects of the number of configurations available, the correlation between different configurations, as well as the effect of radiation efficiency differences between the different configurations. Our results show that a reconfigurable antenna designer should aim at designing an antenna that can provide a relatively large number of available configurations with as high pattern diversity as possible, but should also aim at keeping the radiation efficiency of the different configurations balanced. The Distributed technique in which only the receiver is allowed to switch configurations (i.e., RXRA) was shown to strike a good balance between sum network capacity increases and practical channel feedback and network information constraints.
