    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to particles such as nanoparticles and, in particular, to targeted nanoparticles. In some cases, the particles may have a targeting moiety that is inhibited from recognizing a target, for example, by being positioned within the particle at an internal location. The application of a stimulus, such as light, may allow the targeting moiety to interact externally of the particle. Accordingly, the particles may be targeted to specific locations using the application of a suitable stimulus. For instance, in one embodiment, particles containing cell-penetrating peptides attached via a first attachment and a second attachment containing a photocleavable entity may be administered to a subject, and light may be applied, e.g., to the eye, to cleave the photocleavable entity. However, despite the cleavage, the peptides remain associated with the particle via the first attachment, and thus, the particles may be able to penetrate cells within the eye due to peptides. Other aspects are generally directed to methods of making or using such particles, kits involving such particles, or the like.",

                        "Retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and vascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are leading causes of blindness in infants, adults and the elderly in the U.S., respectively. These diseases of varying etiology are all characterized by the development of pathogenic neovascularization, which disrupts retinal structure and function, causing irreversible vision loss. Currently, the standard therapies for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases are laser photocoagulation and repeated intravitreal injections of antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor. They are effective in slowing or preventing neovascularization, but suffer from serious side effects\u2014for example, laser treatment inevitably destroys retinal tissue , and intraocular injections are unpleasant for the patients and bear risks of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. Less invasive means of administration of therapeutics, for example by intravenous injection, is therefore desirable. However, systemic administration of drugs often results in inadequate concentrations of drugs at the diseased site; this is particularly true of delivery to the back of the eye (retina and associated structures). Increasing drug levels at the target site by increasing the dose could lead to systemic toxicity. Recent advances in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) provide opportunities to improve drugs' therapeutic effects. DDSs that enable drug delivery to the back of the eye are administered locally by intravitreal injection, or systemically. Systemic DDS can reach diseased sites due to the leaky vasculature in neovascular eye diseases, or by targeting the ligand-modified DDS to specific antigens. Such targeting is impeded by variability in the expression of ligand receptor at the diseased site and, by the basal expression of certain target antigens (e.g., endoglin, integrin) in normal tissue. Accordingly, improvements in delivery are still needed."

                        "The present invention generally relates to particles such as nanoparticles and, in particular, to targeted nanoparticles. In some cases, the particles may have a targeting moiety that is inhibited from recognizing a target, for example, by being positioned within the particle at an internal location. The application of a stimulus, such as light, may allow the targeting moiety to interact externally of the particle. Accordingly, the particles may be targeted to specific locations using the application of a suitable stimulus. For instance, in one embodiment, particles containing cell-penetrating peptides attached via a first attachment and a second attachment containing a photocleavable entity may be administered to a subject, and light may be applied, e.g., to the eye, to cleave the photocleavable entity. However, despite the cleavage, the peptides remain associated with the particle via the first attachment, and thus, the particles may be able to penetrate cells within the eye due to peptides. Other aspects are generally directed to methods of making or using such particles, kits involving such particles, or the like.",
                        "In one aspect, the present invention is generally directed to systems and methods useful for the targeted delivery of particles into specific locations within the body. For example, in one embodiment, particles may be administered to a subject, and the particles may then enter systemic circulation. The particles do not contain any surface features, such as targeting moieties, that allow the particles to be introduced into cells, and thus, the particles are able to remain in systemic circulation. However, the particles may subsequently be altered in some fashion, e.g., upon exposure to light or another stimulus, that causes the particles to exhibit a targeting moiety on their surfaces. The targeting moiety can then allow the particles to be delivered to cells at a specific location of the body, for example, near the region where the light or other stimulus is applied. Thus, localized delivery of the particles can be achieved by the suitable application of light (or other stimulus) to a specific location of the body, while the particles otherwise generally remain in circulation.",
                        "As a non-limiting example, particles may be administered systemically to a subject, while light of a certain wavelength applied to the eyes to cause particles within the eye to penetrate cells. Accordingly, drugs contained within the particles may specifically be delivered to an eye of a subject, even though the particles are systemically applied.",
                        "A variety of techniques may be used to create particles where the surface features are controllable, e.g., upon application of light or another stimulus. As a non-limiting example, a particle may contain a cell-penetrating peptide as a targeting moiety, attached to the particle via a first attachment and a second attachment. A specific example is illustrated in FIG. 1A, left. The cell-penetrating peptides may be positioned within the particle via the attachments such that they are inhibited from functioning. For instance, the peptides may be positioned internally of the particle (e.g., such that they are not exposed to the surface), and/or there may be a blocking group positioned to prevent the peptides from being able to recognize a cell, for example, due to steric effects, distortion of the peptide, physical blockage, or the like.",
                        "In some cases, the second attachment may be cleavable in some fashion. For instance, the second attachment may include a photocleavable moiety, such as 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-4-yl]methyl carboxyl (DEACM), that may be cleaved upon exposure to light, e.g., of a suitable wavelength, e.g., as is shown in FIG. 1A, right. When that light is applied, the photoclevable moiety may be cleaved, thereby detaching the cell-penetrating peptide at its second point of attachment. However, the peptide is not then free to drift away from the particle, as it is still attached at a first point of attachment. Attachment at the first point of attachment may allow the peptide to be exposed at the surface of the particle, e.g., as the peptide may still be \u201ctethered\u201d to the particle (for example, as show in FIG. 1A), or because the blocking group no longer blocks access to the peptide. In such a fashion, the cell-penetrating peptide can then recognize cells, and may accordingly facilitate delivery of the particles into those cells.",
                        "The above discussion is a non-limiting example of one embodiment of the present invention that is generally directed to particles, such as nanoparticles, that can be used for targeted delivery to the eye of a subject. However, other embodiments are also possible. Accordingly, more generally, various aspects of the invention are directed to various systems and methods generally directed to particles such as nanoparticles.",
                        "Some aspects of the present invention are generally directed to particles, such as nanoparticles, having a core region and a shell region. The core and the shell may have different hydrophobicities, e.g., the core may be relatively hydrophobic and the shell may be relatively hydrophilic, relative to each other. For example, the core may be formed from one or more polymers having a water contact angle of at least 90\u00b0, while the shell may be formed from one or more polymers having a water contact angle of less than 90\u00b0. Examples of such polymers, and dimensions of such particles, are described in more detail below.",
                        "The particle may include an activatable agent that can be controlled to allow access to a targeting entity. For example, prior to activation, the targeting entity may be inhibited from recognizing a target, but after activation, at least some of the targeting entity can then recognize a target. As examples, the targeting entity may be positioned within the particle, e.g., such that the targeting moiety is present within and/or contacts the core of the particle, such that the targeting moiety is not present on an outer surface of the particle, the targeting entity may be blocked by another portion of the activation entity such that it cannot recognize a target, the targeting entity is in a molecular configuration such that it cannot recognize a target, or the like. Thus, for example, the targeting entity may be distributed within the particle such that at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or substantially all of the targeting entity (by mass) is not present on the surface of the particle, and/or is present but cannot recognize a target, e.g., due to conformation, blockage, or the like.",
                        "In one set of embodiments, the activatable agent may include a cleavable entity and a targeting moiety. As discussed below, the targeting moiety may be able to recognize a target, while the cleavable entity may be cleaved to activate the activatable agent to allow the targeting moiety may be able to recognize a target.",
                        "In some cases, the activatable agent may be attached to a polymer forming the particle. For instance, as is shown in FIG. 10, an activatable agent 10 may comprise a first portion comprising a targeting moiety 11 and a second portion comprising a cleavable entity 12. The targeting moiety and the cleavable entity may be present within the activatable agent in any suitable order, in addition to the order shown here. The first portion may be attached to a polymer 13, while the second portion may be relatively hydrophobic and may thus associate with a hydrophobic region of a particle 20, e.g., a core region 21, while polymer 13 may be present within a shell region 22. Due to the association of the second portion with the hydrophobic region, the first portion of the activatable agent containing the targeting moiety may not be present on the outer surface of the particle, or may be present on the outer surface but be inhibited from being able to recognize a target, e.g., due to the conformation of the activatable agent. However, cleavage of the cleavable entity may then separate the first portion and the second portion of the activatable agent, which may allow the first portion, containing the targeting moiety, to reach the outer surface of the particle, or otherwise allow it to recognize an appropriate target.",
                        "The targeting entity may be any entity able to recognize an appropriate target. A variety of moieties may be used as the targeting moiety. In one set of embodiments, the targeting moiety may comprise a peptide, e.g., one that can recognize a suitable target. For example, the targeting moiety may comprise an RGD peptide (e.g., which can bind to for example, which can bind to certain extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin), or a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP).",
                        "A wide variety of cell-penetrating peptides are known. For example, the cell-penetrating peptide may be a Tat-C cell-penetrating peptide, a Tat(48-60) cell-penetrating peptide, or a Tat(48-57) cell-penetrating peptide. Other non-limiting examples of cell-penetrating peptides include CGGFRKKRRQRRR (SEQ ID NO: 1), RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK (SEQ ID NO: 2), GRKKRRQRRRPPQ (SEQ ID NO: 3), LLIILRRRIRKQAHAHSK (SEQ ID NO: 4), GWTLNSAGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKIL (SEQ ID NO: 5), GALFLGFLGAAGSTMGAWSQPKKKRKV (SEQ ID NO: 6), KETWWETWWTEWSQPKKKRKV (SEQ ID NO: 7), Rn wherein n is between 6 and 12 inclusively (i.e., 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12) (SEQ ID NO: 8), KLALKLALKALKAALKLA (SEQ ID NO: 9), RRWWRRWRR (SEQ ID NO: 10), CGGG(ARKKAAKA)4 (SEQ ID NO: 11), or CGGFRKKRRQ (SEQ ID NO: 12)",
                        "In some cases the peptide may have less than 50, less than 40, less than 30, less than 25, less than 20, or less than 15 amino acid residues. In certain cases, the peptide may have at least 5, at least 10, or at least 15 amino acid residues.",
                        "Other targeting moieties are also possible. For example, the targeting moiety may comprise an antibody, an antibody fragment, an antigen, a binding partner for a cell-surface receptor, or the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, anti-CD13 antibodies, NGR peptides that recognizes CD143 (e.g., having a sequence CYGGRGNG (SEQ ID NO: 13)), transferrin, phage-derived human antibody fragments having high affinity for the ED-B domain of fibronectin (e.g., L19), anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (alpha-5-beta-3) monoclonal antibodies, and nucleic acid aptamers.",
                        "The cleavable entity may be any entity that can be cleaved, e.g., in response to an appropriate stimulus. For example, a photocleavable entity can be cleaved upon exposure to light of a suitable wavelength, e.g., visible light and/or ultraviolet light. In some cases, the applied light may be light having an average wavelength of between 300 nm and 500 nm, between 350 nm and 450 nm, between 400 nm and 700 nm, between 10 nm and 400 nm, between 570 nm and 900 nm, or the like. As another example, a cleavable entity may be cleaved upon exposure to heat. For instance, the heat may be generated by magnetic field, light or ultrasound. In some cases, for instance, the cleavable entity may be a nucleic acid (or a pair of nucleic acids) that is cleaved via heat-induced dehybridization of the nucleic acid.",
                        "In one set of embodiments, the photocleavable entity is coumarin-based, e.g., having a coumarin-based photocaging group. Other examples of photocleavable entities include o-nitrobenzyl, benzoinyl(desyl), 4-hydroxyphenacyl and ruthenium-based photocaging groups. As a specific non-limiting example, the photocleavable entity may be 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-4-yl]methyl carboxyl (DEACM). In some cases, the coumarin photocaging group modified at the 3-position, e.g., as is discussed in Lin, et al., \u201cCoumarin Photocaging Groups Modified with an Electron-Rich Styryl Moiety at the 3-Position: Long-Wavelength Excitation, Rapid Photolysis, and Photobleaching,\u201d Ang. Chem. Int. Ed., 57(14):3722-3726, 2018, all of the coumarin and other photocaging moieties of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "In some embodiments, the cleavable entity may be relatively hydrophobic. For instance, the cleavable entity may be able to associate with the core region of a particle having a core region and a shell region, which may inhibit the targeting moiety from reaching the outer surface of the particle or allowing it to recognize an appropriate target. In certain embodiments, for example, the cleavable entity may preferentially associate with the polymers that form the core region, relative to the polymers that from the shell region. The cleavable entity may exhibit a water contact angle of at least 90\u00b0 in some embodiments.",
                        "As discussed, the particle may comprise a core and a shell, and may be spherical or non-spherical. Spherical particles may be particularly useful in some embodiments, for example, to facilitate cellular uptake. The particle may have any suitable diameter. In some cases, the particle can be a nanoparticle, e.g., having an diameter measured in nanometers. For instance, the particle may have a hydrodynamic diameter of less than 1000 nm, less than 500 nm, less than 300 nm, less than 100 nm, less than 50 nm, less than 30 nm, or less than 10 nm.

Additional examples of administration are discussed in more detail below. The particles may be targeted by cleaving a cleavable entity to allow the targeting entity to recognize a target at a certain site within the body, e.g., in an eye, in a tumor (e.g., during a surgical procedure), or the like, thereby allowing targeting of the particle to that site and the delivery of the drug contained within the particles.",

In some cases, the light may be administered directly (e.g., using a laser), or the light may be guided to a suitable location, e.g., using a fiber-optic cable or the like. If applied to the eye, the light may be applied to the entire eye, or targeted at a specific location or region to the eye, e.g., the lens, cornea, iris, retina, scelra, or the like.

In some cases, it is believed that abnormally-growing blood vessels within the eye (for example, within a tumor) may exhibit pathological vasculature, i.e., such blood vessels may not be as \u201cstreamlined\u201d as normal blood vessels, which may cause the blood flowing through those blood vessels to flow more slowly, or have a longer residence time. Because of the longer time the blood remains within those locations, particles contained within the blood in those regions can be exposed to light for a longer duration than within blood flowing through other portions of the eye. Accordingly, particles in those regions may be preferentially activated relative to particles within other locations. Thus, preferential targeting of those particles may be achieved.",

                                "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the major cause of vision loss in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current therapies require repeated intravitreal injections, which are painful and can cause infection, bleeding, and retinal detachment. These examples describe a drug delivery system that can be administered intravenously and accumulate in the back of the eye by light-triggered targeting. Photo-targeted nanoparticles (NP-[CPP]) were formed from PEG-PLA chains modified with a cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Cell uptake of NP-[CPP] was inactivated by attaching a photocleavable group DEACM to the CPP, which also placed [CPP] in the core of the nanoparticle, preventing it from interacting with cells. Irradiation with 400 nm (blue) light cleaved DEACM, releasing CPP from the NP core and rendering it active.",
                                "This system was evaluated in mice with laser-induced CNV. After intravenous injection of NP-[CPP], irradiation at the eye cleaved DEACM, allowing NP accumulation in the choroidal neovascular lesions. NP-[CPP] with irradiation showed greater accumulation in neovascular lesions compared to the same nanoparticles without irradiation or nanoparticles without CPP. In the same mouse CNV model, NP-[CPP] loaded with doxorubicin significantly reduced neovascular lesion size. This phototriggered targeting strategy could allow non-invasive treatment of CNV and similar diseases, and enhance the proportion of drug in diseased areas of the eye vs. other healthy parts of the eye or body.",
                                "Externally triggered targeting can enable drug delivery with high spatial and temporal resolution. Light is especially attractive as the energy source for targeting the retina, since the eye is designed to admit light. These examples illustrate a system whereby nanoparticles (NPs) are administered intravenously, and are converted to a tissue-targeting state only upon irradiation in the eye. This strategy would allow the targeted accumulation of drug to be triggered locally at the back of the eye, while minimizing drug deposition at off-target sites in healthy parts of the eye and in the rest of the body.",
                                "Photo-targeted nanoparticles were formed by self-assembly of a chemically modified poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) block copolymer (FIG. 1A). The nanoparticles' surfaces were modified with Tat-C (48-57) cell penetrating peptide (CPP) as the targeting moiety due to its high cellular uptake. The biological activity of the peptide was reversibly inactivated by covalent binding to a photocleavable caging group, 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-4-yl]methyl carboxyl (DEACM), which was selected for its high photocleavage efficiency and relatively long (400 nm) absorption wavelength (low phototoxicity). Upon irradiation, the caging group would be removed by bond cleavage so that the peptide could readily bind to nearby cells. The DEACM-CPP functionalized nanoparticles could then enhance the accumulation of drugs at the diseased site and minimize off-target drug delivery. This approach could obviate the need for intraocular injections with their attendant risks, and improve patient compliance."

FIG. 1B shows the synthesis of caged CPP ([CPP])-functionalized polymer chain, the details of which are provided below. In brief, [CPP] was synthesized by linking DEACM to the amine group on peptide side chains via nucleophilic substitution. The [CPP] with cysteine at the N-terminus (amino acid sequence acetyl-CGGFRKKRRQRRR) (SEQ ID NO: 1) was then conjugated to the PEG end of maleimide-modified PEG-PLA via maleimide-thiol coupling. Photo-targeted nanoparticles were made by the thin-film hydration method from [CPP]-PEG-PLA and methoxy PEG-PLA (mPEG-PLA) (1:4 weight ratio). The resulting micelles, referred to as photo-targeted nanoparticles and abbreviated as NP-[CPP] (FIG. 1A), had a hydrodynamic diameter of 19.0 +/\u22122 nm (FIGS. 1C).",
                                "It was believed that the hydrophobic DEACM groups would localize in the PLA core of the nanoparticle, and the photocleavage reaction would release the more hydrophilic DEACM-OH into the aqueous environment. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the fluorescence spectrum of NP-[CPP] solution showed a red shift and decrease in the emission intensity upon irradiation with 400 nm LED light (FIG. 1D). The red shift (from 465 nm to 481 nm in maximum emission wavelength) was attributable to the increased polarity of DEACM's environment and the decrease in intensity to the quenching of fluorescence by water. Further evidence indicating the presence of the CPP in the hydrophobic core was obtained by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectrum of NP-[CPP] did not show peaks of the phenyl protons from phenylalanine in the range of 7.25-7.45 ppm, because of the restricted mobility of the phenyl protons within the PLA cores of the nanoparticles. Irradiation resulted in the appearance of those peaks, confirming that the phenylalanine in NP-[CPP] was located in the PLA core and photocleavage led to its translocation to the surface (FIG. 1E).",
                                "To measure the rate of phototriggered release of DEACM-OH from NP-[CPP], a quartz cuvette containing 1 mL of 0.5 mg/mL NP-[CPP] solution was continuously irradiated with 400 nm LED light at 50 mW/cm2. At predetermined time points, DEACM was separated from the nanoparticle solution by centrifugation and DEACM-OH content was determined (FIG. 1f) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (\u03bb, lambda=390 nm). 89.7 +/\u22121.7% of DEACM-OH was released after 1 min.",

Fluorescence was undetectable by this approach in all choroids, even though fluorescence was seen on microscopy, possibly due to the small amounts of material involved (the entire choroid weighed \u02dc1 mg). Therefore, the mean fluorescence intensity in the choroids (from microscopy, FIG. 4B) was used as the metric for AMF accumulation in the eye. It was found that the ratio of AMF accumulation in the eye to that in other organs in the NP-AMF-[CPP]+hv group was roughly twice (1.7 to 2.4 fold, depending on the organ) that in the NP-AMF-[CPP] group (FIG. 9B).",
