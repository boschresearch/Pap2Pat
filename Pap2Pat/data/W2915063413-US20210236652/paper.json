    "date": "2019-02-18",
    "abstract": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the major cause of vision loss in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current therapies require repeated intravitreal injections, which are painful and can cause infection, bleeding, and retinal detachment. Here we develop nanoparticles (NP-[CPP]) that can be administered intravenously and allow local drug delivery to the diseased choroid via light-triggered targeting. NP-[CPP] is formed by PEG-PLA chains modified with a cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Attachment of a DEACM photocleavable group to the CPP inhibits cellular uptake of NP-[CPP]. Irradiation with blue light cleaves DEACM from the CPP, allowing the CPP to migrate from the NP core to the surface, rendering it active. In mice with laser-induced CNV, intravenous injection of NP-[CPP] coupled to irradiation of the eye allows NP accumulation in the neovascular lesions. When loaded with doxorubicin, irradiated NP-[CPP] significantly reduces neovascular lesion size. We propose a strategy for non-invasive treatment of CNV and enhanced drug accumulation specifically in diseased areas of the eye.",

                "Retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and vascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are the leading causes of blindness in infants, adults and the elderly in the US, respectively1. These diseases of varying etiology are characterized by the development of pathological\u00a0neovascularization, which disrupts retinal structure and function, causing irreversible vision loss. Currently, the standard therapies for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases are laser photocoagulation and repeated intravitreal injections of antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor2,3. They are effective in slowing or preventing neovascularization, but suffer from serious side effects: laser treatment inevitably destroys retinal tissue4, and intraocular injections are unpleasant for the patients and bear risks of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment5. Less invasive means of administration of therapeutics, for example by intravenous injection, are\u00a0therefore desirable. However, systemic administration of drugs often results in inadequate concentrations of drugs at the diseased site; this is particularly true of delivery to the back of the eye (retina and associated structures). Increasing drug levels at the target site by increasing the dose could lead to systemic toxicity. Recent advances in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) provide opportunities to improve drugs\u2019 therapeutic effects6. DDSs that enable drug delivery to the back of the eye7 are administered locally by intravitreal injection, or systemically. Systemic DDS can reach diseased sites due to the leaky vasculature in neovascular eye diseases8,9, or by targeting the ligand-modified DDS to specific antigens10\u201313. Such targeting is impeded by variability in the expression of ligand receptor at the diseased site and, and by the basal expression of certain target antigens (e.g., endoglin, integrin) in normal tissue14.",
                "Externally triggered targeting can enable drug delivery with high spatial and temporal resolution15\u201319. Light is especially attractive as the energy source for targeting the retina, since the eye is designed to admit light. We and others have demonstrated the possibility of using light to control targeting of nanoparticles to cells and tumors20\u201323. Here we design a system whereby nanoparticles (NPs) are administered intravenously, and are converted to a tissue-targeting state only upon irradiation in the eye (Fig.\u00a01a). Our strategy would allow the targeted accumulation of drug to be triggered locally at the back of the eye, while minimizing drug deposition at off-target sites in healthy parts of the eye and in the rest of the body.Fig. 1Preparation and characterization of phototargeted nanoparticles. a Phototargeting intravenously administered nanoparticles to choroidal neovascularization. b Schematic of light-triggered activation of the nanoparticle. c Synthesis of the polymer chain functionalized with caged CPP ([CPP]). d Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of NP-[CPP].

                "Photo-targeted nanoparticles are formed by self-assembly of a chemically modified poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) block copolymer (Fig.\u00a01b). The nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces are modified with Tat-C (48\u201357) cell penetrating peptide (CPP) as the targeting moiety due to its high cellular uptake24. The biological activity of the peptide is reversibly inactivated by covalent binding to a photocleavable caging group, 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-4-yl]methyl carboxyl (DEACM), which is selected for its high photocleavage efficiency and relatively long (400\u2009nm) absorption wavelength (low phototoxicity)25. Upon irradiation, the caging group would be removed by bond cleavage so that the peptide could readily bind to nearby cells. The DEACM-CPP functionalized nanoparticles could then enhance the accumulation of drugs at the diseased site and minimize off-target drug delivery. Importantly, this approach would obviate the need for intraocular injections with their attendant risks, and improve patient compliance."

                        "Figure\u00a01c shows the synthesis of caged CPP ([CPP])-functionalized polymer chain, the details of which are provided in Supporting Information. In brief, [CPP] was synthesized by linking DEACM to the amine group on peptide side chains via nucleophilic substitution (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). The [CPP] with cysteine at the N-terminus (amino acid sequence acetyl-CGGFRKKRRQRRR) was then conjugated to the PEG end of maleimide-modified PEG-PLA via maleimide-thiol coupling. Photo-targeted nanoparticles were made by the thin-film hydration method from [CPP]-PEG-PLA and methoxy PEG-PLA (mPEG-PLA) (1:4 weight ratio). The resulting micelles, referred to as photo-targeted nanoparticles and abbreviated as NP-[CPP] (Fig.\u00a01b), had a hydrodynamic diameter of 19.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009nm (means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; n\u2009=\u20094, Fig.\u00a01d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02).",
                        "We hypothesized that the hydrophobic DEACM groups would localize in the PLA core of the nanoparticle, and the photocleavage reaction would release the more hydrophilic DEACM-OH into the aqueous environment. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the fluorescence spectrum of NP-[CPP] solution showed a red shift and decrease in the emission intensity upon irradiation with 400\u2009nm LED light (Fig.\u00a01e). The red shift (from 465 to 481\u2009nm in maximum emission wavelength) was attributable to the increased polarity of DEACM\u2019s environment and the decrease in intensity to the quenching of fluorescence by water26. Further evidence indicating the presence of the CPP in the hydrophobic core was obtained by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. The\u00a01H NMR spectrum of NP-[CPP] did not show peaks of the phenyl protons from phenylalanine in the range of 7.25\u20137.45 ppm, because of the restricted mobility of the phenyl protons within the PLA cores of the nanoparticles27. Irradiation resulted in the appearance of those peaks, confirming that the phenylalanine in NP-[CPP] was located in the PLA core and photocleavage led to its translocation to the surface (Fig.\u00a01f).",
                        "To measure the rate of phototriggered release of DEACM-OH from NP-[CPP], a quartz cuvette containing 1\u2009mL of 0.5\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 NP-[CPP] solution was continuously irradiated with 400\u2009nm LED light at 50\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122. At predetermined time points, DEACM was separated from the nanoparticle solution by centrifugation and DEACM-OH content was determined (Fig.\u00a01g) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (\u03bb\u2009=\u2009390\u2009nm). 89.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7% of DEACM\u2212OH was released after 1\u2009min."

The weight percentage of AMF-PEG-PLA in the nanoparticles was 10%.",
                        "To determine the proportion of peptide-polymer conjugate to use in subsequent experiments, HUVECs were incubated with nanoparticles containing varying proportions of CPP-PEG-PLA or [CPP]-PEG-PLA. HUVEC uptake of nanoparticles increased with the proportion of CPP-PEG-PLA to a maximum at 40% w/w, then decreased at higher proportions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). We then studied the effect of caging on cell uptake at the two loadings with the greatest uptake when uncaged. Nanoparticles with 40% w/w [CPP]-PEG-PLA were taken up by cells to a greater extent than were nanoparticles with 20% w/w [CPP]-PEG-PLA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). From the flow cytometric analyses (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03), the ratio of cell-associated NP fluorescence in cells exposed to NPs with 20% CPP to NPs with 20% [CPP] was 4.7; that of NPs with 40% CPP to those with 40% [CPP] was 3.3. Given that off-target delivery remains a dominant problem even with targeted systems22 (also see biodistribution data below), we therefore used nanoparticles with 20% w/w [CPP]-PEG-PLA in subsequent experiments.",

Cell-associated AMF fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. HUVECs incubated with NP-AMF-CPPs exhibited 9.9-fold greater fluorescence than those exposed to peptide-free nanoparticles (Fig.\u00a02a and b), which demonstrated the ability of CPP to bind nanoparticles to cells. NP-AMF-[CPP] exhibited little cell-associated fluorescence, suggesting that the caging strategy prevented ligand-mediated NP-cell interaction. Irradiation with a 400\u2009nm LED (50\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122, 1\u2009min) increased cellular uptake to levels comparable to those with NP-AMF-CPP. These results confirmed that the DEACM caging group could be cleaved from NP-AMF-[CPP] by irradiation, which revealed CPP on the nanoparticle surface and enabled cellular uptake. The size and granularity\u00a0(internal complexity) of cells remained the same for all groups (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017).Fig. 2Light-triggered cell uptake of nanoparticles. a Representative flow cytometry of FITC fluorescence within HUVEC cells treated with different nanoparticles or without nanoparticle. b Quantitation (mean of four median values of fluorescence intensity) of flow cytometric analyses (such as the one in panel A) of HUVEC uptake of nanoparticles.

Fluorescence was undetectable by this approach in all choroids, even though fluorescence was seen on microscopy, possibly due to the small amounts of material involved (the entire choroid weighed ~1\u2009mg). Therefore, the mean fluorescence intensity in the choroids (from microscopy, Fig.\u00a04b) was used as the metric for AMF accumulation in the eye.

                "We have developed an intravenously injected, photo-targeted treatment regimen for CNV and demonstrated its efficacy in the standard mouse CNV model. We showed that phototargeting can enhance nanoparticle accumulation in the abnormal vessels in CNV, and can significantly enhance treatment. Notably, the inhibitory effect of NP-[CPP]-doxo plus irradiation on CNV growth was comparable to that of\u00a0locally administered drug formulations reported previously31,33,34. The intensity and duration of irradiation used in our study did not cause damage to the mouse eyes, and NP-[CPP]-doxo did not cause tissue toxicity.",
                "Further developments of this proof-of-principle system could be designed to provide better therapeutic efficacy by changing the drug used, and/or drug dosage and irradiation parameters. The dosing regimen we used was dictated in part by the characteristics of the mouse model of laser-induced CNV, wherein lesions develop over 7 days, and regress spontaneously from 14 days on29. However, the disease that this model mimics \u2013 the exudative form of AMD \u2013 is chronic. Consequently, the best therapeutic regimen in humans might be more extensive (for example, repeated weekly IV injections), perhaps with even more pronounced benefits. Moreover, the formulation used here could be further improved with respect to drug loading, nanoparticle concentration, duration of infusion, and perhaps other nanoparticle characteristics (size, ligand type, etc.). The irradiation itself could perhaps be modified in intensity and duration to enhance nanoparticle uptake in the eye as well as patient tolerance. The specific payload of the NP-[CPP] could also be modified, since they could encapsulate a variety of drugs, singly or in combination. The retention and clearance of doxorubicin in mouse organs could be monitored by fluorimetry (of doxorubicin) of organ extracts at different time points following intravenous injection of doxorubicin-containing NPs. (This might also be possible in CNV lesions at higher doxorubicin loadings.) Such information may be helpful in optimizing the dosing regimen for treating CNV by the intravenous route, especially if further modification of the phototargeted NPs provided more extended release of the encapsulated therapeutics which would allow for less frequent dosing. The enhanced effect in the phototriggered group in our study is attributable to the enhanced accumulation of drug, as evidenced indirectly by enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in the CNV lesion. We cannot exclude a possible therapeutic contribution from the photo-triggered accumulation of NP-CPP.",
                "This work contributes to the small but growing body of evidence that photo-targeted (and other targeting) strategies can increase local drug deposition with resulting therapeutic benefits, and extends it to non-cancer conditions16,22. (It is not clear that such benefits accrue in conditions where some process such as EPR does not facilitate NP uptake into the diseased tissue). As has been correctly pointed out35, the amounts of drug involved are quite small as a percentage of the total dose delivered, as further evidenced by the fact that our biodistribution studies could not detect any extractable fluorescent dye in eye tissue. Nonetheless, those small amounts are clearly effective, as we have demonstrated here and in a tumor model22. We have argued that what matters is perhaps not the absolute amount delivered, but whether the amount at the target site can be increased and in particular whether it can be increased in proportion to the amounts delivered to off-target sites (i.e. whether the therapeutic index can be improved)16.",
                "Currently, the primary treatment of CNV is monthly intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors36. Frequent intravitreal injections pose risks such as bleeding, infection, retinal detachment and degeneration37, and patients find them unpleasant, which may be a major cause of non-compliance38. The nanoparticulate therapy described here can be triggered by safe, inexpensive and portable LEDs, potentially enabling broad clinical use. This system could mitigate the need for invasive intraocular injections in treating ocular diseases, specifically other neovascular retinal diseases."

Organs were weighed and sonicated in 500\u2009\u03bcL 5% Triton X-100 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice for 2\u2009min, then the same volume of methanol was added to extract the AMF and another 2\u2009min of sonication was performed. Mixtures underwent mechanical agitation for 2\u2009min and were then centrifuged at 14,462 \u00d7 g for 15\u2009min (Microfuge 22R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). To determine the content of AMF in each tissue homogenate sample, 800\u2009\u03bcL of the supernatant solution was transferred into a cuvette and analyzed by a fluorescence spectrometer (Agilent, CA, USA). Tissue samples from untreated mice were measured as controls for auto fluorescence, which was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of the experimental groups. The data were divided by tissue mass (\u03bcg\u2009g\u22121)."

Images were digitized with a digital camera. ImageJ software (NIH, USA) was used to measure the total area (in \u00b5m2) of CNV associated with each laser burn by an observer (Y.W.) who was blinded to the nature of the individual images. A calibration image was taken from a slide with a grating of known size. An established and constant threshold in pixels (corresponding to threshold fluorescence) was used to outline the fluorescent blood vessels and quantify the area of neovascularization. A lesion was excluded if one of the following conditions occurred, according to previously reported protocols39,41: (1) there was choroidal hemorrhage; (2) the lesion was linear instead of circular; (3) there was fusion of two or more lesions; (4) the lesion was the only lesion in an eye; (5) the area of the lesion was more than fivefold larger than the next biggest lesion in the same eye, or less than 1/5 the area of the next smallest lesion in the eye."
