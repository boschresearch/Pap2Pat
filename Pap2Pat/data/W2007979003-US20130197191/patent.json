                        "Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) is a secreted polypeptide that belongs to a subfamily of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) that includes FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 (Itoh et al., 2004, Trend Genet. 20: 563-69). FGF21 is an a typical FGF in that it is heparin independent and functions as a hormone in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism.",
                        "FGF21 is highly expressed in liver and pancreas and is the only member of the FGF family to be primarily expressed in liver. Transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 exhibit metabolic phenotypes of slow growth rate, low plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, and an absence of age-associated type 2 diabetes, islet hyperplasia, and obesity. Pharmacological administration of recombinant FGF21 protein in rodent and primate models results in normalized levels of plasma glucose, reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, FGF21 reduces body weight and body fat by increasing energy expenditure, physical activity, and metabolic rate. (Xu et al. 2009 Diabetes 58:250-259) There is also evidence that FGF21 may have a protective effect in acute pancreatitis (Johnson et al. 2009 Gasteroenterology 137(5):1795-1804).",
                        "Experimental research provides support for the pharmacological administration of FGF21 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic conditions or disorders in humans. (Xu et al., 2009 Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 297:E1105-E1114; Reviewed in Ryden 2009 Cell Mol Life Sci. 66:2067-73)",
                        "FGF21 is a liver derived endocrine hormone that stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes and lipid homeostasis through the activation of its receptor. Interestingly, in addition to the canonical FGF receptor, FGFR1c, the FGF21 receptor also consists of the membrane associated \u03b2-Klotho as an essential cofactor. Activation of the FGF21 receptor leads to multiple beneficial effects on a variety of metabolic parameters.",
                        "In mammals, FGFs mediate their action via a set of four FGF receptors FGFR1-4 that in turn are expressed in multiple spliced variants. Each FGF receptor contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated upon ligand binding, leading to downstream signaling pathways involving MAPKs (Erk1/2), RAF1, AKT1 and STATs. (Kharitonenkov et al., 2008 BioDrugs 22:37-44). Several reports suggested that the \u201cc\u201d-reporter splice variants of FGFR1-3 exhibit specific affinity to \u03b2Klotho and could act as endogenous receptor for FGF21 (Kurosu et al., 2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282:26687-26695); Ogawa et al., 2007 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:7432-7437; Kharitonenkov et al., 2008 J. Cell Physiol. 215, 1-7). In the liver, which abundantly expresses both \u03b2Klotho and FGFR4, FGF21 does not induce phosphrylation of MAPK albeit the strong binding of FGF21 to the \u03b2Klotho-FGFR4 complex. In 3T3-L1 cells and white adipose tissue, FGFR1 is by far the most abundant receptor, and it is therefore most likely that FGF21's main functional receptors in this tissue are the \u03b2Klotho-FGFR1c complexes.",
                        "The present disclosure provides binding proteins, including bispecific binding proteins, that can activate FGF21-mediated signaling, i.e., an agonistic binding protein that mimics the function of FGF21. Such a binding protein can be a molecule with FGF21-like activity and selectivity but with added therapeutically desirable characteristics such as protein stability, low immunogenicity, ease of production and a desirable in vivo half-life."

A binding protein specifically binds its target with \u201chigh affinity\u201d when the KD is \u22665\u00d710\u22129 M, and with \u201cvery high affinity\u201d when the KD is \u22665\u00d710\u221210 M when tested using a binding assay, such as the assay described in Example 7. In one embodiment, a binding protein will bind to FGFR1c, \u03b2-Klotho or both FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho, e.g. human FGFR1c, human \u03b2-Klotho or both human FGFR1c and human \u03b2-Klotho, with an EC50 of between about 10\u22128 M and 10\u221210 M as determined by binding ELISA, and in yet another embodiment the binding proteins will bind with a EC50\u22665\u00d710\u22129 as determined by binding ELISA. Thus, the phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds\u201d to a polypeptide, when referring to a monomer, multimer, or binding protein, refers to a binding reaction that can be determinative of the presence of the polypeptide in a heterogeneous population of proteins (e.g., a cell or tissue lysate) and other biologics. Thus, under standard conditions or assays used in antibody binding assays, a binding protein (e.g., a monomer or multimer) specifically binds to a particular target molecule above background (e.g., 2\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 10\u00d7 or more above background) and does not bind in a significant amount to other molecules present in the sample.",

A monomer domain can form a native three-dimensional structure in solution in the absence of flanking native amino acid sequences. Some monomer domains disclosed herein can specifically bind to a target molecule. For example, a polypeptide that forms a three-dimensional structure that binds to a target molecule is a monomer domain. As used herein, the term \u201cmonomer domain\u201d does not encompass the complementarity determining region (CDR) of an antibody. Two or more monomers can be joined to one another via a linker sequence to form a multimer.",

Examples of human-manipulated changes include, e.g., random mutagenesis, site-specific mutagenesis, recombining, directed evolution, oligo-directed forced crossover events, direct gene synthesis incorporation of mutation, etc. The term \u201cmonomer domain variant\u201d does not embrace a mutagenized complementarity determining region (CDR) of an antibody.",

The present disclosure provides three types of loops that are identified by specific features, such as, potential for disulfide bonding, bridging between secondary protein structures, and molecular dynamics (e.g., flexibility). The three types of loop sequences are a cysteine-defined loop sequence, a structure-defined loop sequence, and a B-factor-defined loop sequence.",

Cysteine-defined loop sequences are identified by multiple sequence alignment of the naturally occurring monomer domains, followed by sequence analysis to identify conserved cysteine residues. The sequence between each consecutive pair of conserved cysteine residues is a cysteine-defined loop sequence. The cysteine-defined loop sequence does not include the cysteine residues adjacent to each terminus. Monomer domains having cysteine-defined loop sequences include the LDL receptor A-domains, EGF-like domains, sushi domains, Fibronectin type 1 domains, and the like. Thus, for example, in the case of LDL receptor A-domains represented by the consensus sequence, CX6CX4CX6CX5CX8C (SEQ ID NO: 5), wherein X6, X4, X5, and X8 each represent a cysteine-defined loop sequence comprising the designated number of amino acids.",

Typically the average alpha-carbon B-factor for the subsequence is at least about 65. As used herein, the term \u201cB-factor\u201d (or \u201ctemperature factor\u201d or \u201cDebye-Waller factor\u201d) is derived from X-ray scattering data. The B-factor is a factor that can be applied to the X-ray scattering term for each atom, or for groups of atoms, that describes the degree to which electron density is spread out B-factors employed in the practice disclosed herein can be either isotropic or anisotropic.

These similar sequences are generally conserved because they are important for the function of the protein and/or the maintenance of the three dimensional structure of the protein. Examples of such families include LDL Receptor A-domain family, the FGF19 subfamily of the FGF family, and the like. Additionally, related sequences that bind to the same target molecule can be divided into families based on common sequence motifs.",

Target molecules can be proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates or any other molecule capable of recognition by a monomer domain. For example, a target molecule can include a chemical compound (i.e., non-biological compound such as, e.g., an organic molecule, an inorganic molecule, or a molecule having both organic and inorganic atoms, but excluding polynucleotides and proteins), a mixture of chemical compounds, an array of spatially localized compounds, a biological macromolecule, a bacteriophage peptide display library, a polysome peptide display library, an extract made from a biological materials such as bacteria, plants, fungi, or animal (e.g., mammalian) cells or tissue, a protein, a toxin, a peptide hormone, a cell, a virus, or the like. Other target molecules include, e.g., a whole cell, a whole tissue, a mixture of related or unrelated proteins, a mixture of viruses or bacterial strains or the like. Target molecules can also be defined by inclusion in screening assays described herein or by enhancing or inhibiting a specific protein interaction (i.e., an agent that selectively inhibits a binding interaction between two predetermined polypeptides). Examples of target molecules include \u03b2-Klotho and FGFR1c.",
                                "The term \u201clinker\u201d is used herein to indicate a moiety or group of moieties that joins or connects two or more discrete separate monomer domains. A linker allows the discrete separate monomer domains to remain separate when joined together in a multimer. A linker moiety is typically a substantially linear moiety. Suitable linkers include polypeptides, polynucleic acids, peptide nucleic acids and the like. Suitable linkers also include optionally substituted alkylene moieties that have one or more oxygen atoms incorporated in the carbon backbone. Typically, the molecular weight of the linker is less than about 2000 daltons. More typically, the molecular weight of the linker is less than about 1500 daltons and often is less than about 1000 daltons. A linker can be small enough to allow the discrete separate monomer domains to cooperate, e.g., where each of the discrete separate monomer domains in a multimer binds to the same target molecule via separate binding sites. Exemplary linkers include a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide, or a polypeptide of amino acids or other non-naturally occurring moieties. A linker can be a portion of a native sequence, a variant thereof, or a synthetic sequence. Linkers can comprise, e.g., naturally occurring, non-naturally occurring amino acids, or a combination of both. Examples of particular linkers that can be employed in the binding proteins disclosed herein include ATHT (SEQ ID NO: 6), PERT (SEQ ID NO: 7), TTRT (SEQ ID NO: 8), GTTGPT (SEQ ID NO: 9), ETSGPT (SEQ ID NO: 10), SQDPEFHKVS (SEQ ID NO: 11), SAPASEPPGSL (SEQ ID NO: 12), GRPGPGATSAPAA (SEQ ID NO: 13), GDSHILPFSTPGPST (SEQ ID NO: 14), [AEKPT][AEKLPT][EHPR]T (SEQ ID NO: 15), [AEKRT][AGS][APSV][AEGV][HP]T (SEQ ID NO: 16), PTKRPEEV (SEQ ID NO: 17), SQDPEFHKV (SEQ ID NO: 18), SAPASEPPGSL (SEQ ID NO: 12), GRPGPGATSAPAA (SEQ ID NO: 13), GDSHILPFSTPGPST (SEQ ID NO: 14), [AEPT][AEPQ][HP]T (SEQ ID NO: 22), [EGT][AGR][AST][EGV][PR]T (SEQ ID NO: 23), KAPVPT (SEQ ID NO: 24), SQDPGFHKV (SEQ ID NO: 25), [APK][AT][HPR]T (SEQ ID NO: 26), [EQ][ART][HP]T (SEQ ID NO: 27), EQRT (SEQ ID NO: 28), RRAAHT (SEQ ID NO: 29), [AK][AG][PS][EG][HP]T (SEQ ID NO: 30), ETPT (SEQ ID NO: 1319), PAPT (SEQ ID NO:1320), QAPT (SEQ ID NO:1321), AQPT (SEQ ID NO:1322), and sequences comprising conservative substitutions, wherein amino acids in brackets indicate alternative amino acids at a specified position.",
                                "The term \u201cseparate\u201d is used herein to indicate a property of a moiety that is independent and remains independent even when complexed with other moieties, including for example, other monomer domains. A monomer domain is a separate domain in a protein because it has an independent property that can be recognized and separated from the protein. For instance, the ligand binding ability of FGFR1c is an independent property. Other examples of separate include the separate monomer domains in a multimer that remain separate independent domains even when complexed or joined together in the multimer by a linker. Another example of a separate property is the separate binding sites in a multimer for a ligand.",
                                "As used herein, \u201cdirected evolution\u201d refers to a process by which polynucleotide variants are generated, expressed, and screened for an activity (e.g., a polypeptide with binding activity) in a recursive process. One or more candidates in the screen are selected and the process is then repeated using polynucleotides that encode the selected candidates to generate new variants. Directed evolution involves at least two rounds of variation generation and can include 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 or more rounds of variation generation and selection. Variation can be generated by any method known to those of skill in the art, including, e.g., by error-prone PCR, gene recombination, chemical mutagenesis and the like.",

In some embodiments, shuffling can include crossover via homologous recombination or via non-homologous recombination, such as via cre/lox and/or flp/frt systems. Shuffling can be carried out by employing a variety of different formats, including for example, in vitro and in vivo shuffling formats, in silico shuffling formats, shuffling formats that utilize either double-stranded or single-stranded templates, primer based shuffling formats, nucleic acid fragmentation-based shuffling formats, and oligonucleotide-mediated shuffling formats, all of which are based on recombination events between non-identical sequences and are described in more detail or referenced herein below, as well as other similar recombination-based formats.",

The random polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence can include framework or scaffolding motifs, which can comprise invariant sequences.",
                                "The term \u201cpseudorandom\u201d as used herein refers to a set of polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences that have limited variability, so that the degree of residue variability at some positions is limited, but any pseudorandom position is allowed at least some degree of residue variation.",

                                "The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs/amino acid mimetics/non-naturally occurring amino acids that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an \u03b1 carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. An \u201camino acid mimetic\u201d is a chemical compound that has a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",

Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=\u22124 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands.",

USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001."

For example, the A-domain structure is conserved among the members of the A-domain family, while the A-domain nucleic acid sequence is not. Thus, for example, a monomer domain is classified as an A-domain by its cysteine residues and its affinity for calcium, not necessarily by its nucleic acid sequence. See FIG. 3B.",

In some embodiments, the domains comprise about 35-45 amino acids and in some cases about 35-40 amino acids. Within the 30-50 amino acids, there are about 6 cysteine residues. Of the six cysteines, disulfide bonds typically are found between the following cysteines: C1 and C3, C2 and C5, C4 and C6. The cysteine residues of the domain are disulfide linked to form a compact, stable, functionally independent moiety. See FIG. 3B. Clusters of these repeats make up a ligand binding domain, and differential clustering can impart specificity with respect to the ligand binding. FIG. 4 presents an exemplary list of various ligands that are recognized by the LDL-receptor family members.",

Consistent with the definition provided hereinabove, the residues in brackets indicate possible residues at one position. \u201cX(#)\u201d indicates number of residues. These residues can be any amino acid residue. Parentheticals containing two numbers refers to the range of amino acids that can occupy that position (e.g., \u201c[DE]-X(1,5)-C\u201d (SEQ ID NO: 36) means that the amino acids DE are followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues, followed by cysteine, \u201cC\u201d). This consensus sequence only represents the portion of the A domain beginning at the third cysteine. A second consensus is as follows: C\u2014X(3-15)-C-X(4-15)-C-X(6-7)-C-[N,D]-X(3)-[D,E,N,Q,H,S,T]-C-X(4-6)-D-E-X(2-8)-C (SEQ ID NO: 37). The second consensus predicts amino acid residues spanning all six cysteine residues. In some embodiments, A domain variants comprise sequences substantially identical to any of the above-described sequences.

Certain positions are marked x, indicating that any amino acid can occupy the position.

Use of brackets in motifs indicates alternate possible amino acids within a position (e.g., \u201c[ekq]\u201d indicates that either E, K or Q can be at that position). As used herein, use of parentheses in a sequence motif indicates that that the positions within the parentheses can be present or absent (e.g., \u201c([ekq])\u201d indicates that the position is absent or either E, K, or Q can be at that position). When more than one \u201cx\u201d is used in parentheses (e.g., \u201c(xx)\u201d), each x represents a possible position.

Thyroglobulin monomer domains are typically about 30-85 or 30-80 amino acids. In some embodiments, the domains comprise about 35-75 amino acids and in some cases about 65 amino acids. Within the 35-75 amino acids, there are typically about 6 cysteine residues. Of the six cysteines, disulfide bonds typically are found between the following cysteines: C1 and C2, C3 and C4, C5 and C6.",
                                "At least 251 naturally occurring thyroglobulin domains have been identified based on cDNA sequences. The N-terminal section of Tg contains 10 repeats of a domain of about 65 amino acids which is known as the Tg type-1 repeat. See, e.g., Malthi\u00e9ry Y, Lissitzky S., Eur J Biochem.

Within the 45-65 amino acids, there are typically about 8 cysteine residues which interact to form 4 disulfide bonds. Laminins are a major noncollagenous component of basement membranes that mediate cell adhesion, growth migration, and differentiation. They are composed of distinct but related alpha, beta, and gamma chains. The three chains form a cross-shaped molecule that consists of a long arm and three short globular arms. The long arm consists of a coiled coil structure contributed by all three chains and cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds.",

Nucleic acids that encode monomer domains can be derived from a variety of different sources. Libraries of monomer domains can be prepared by expressing a plurality of different nucleic acids encoding naturally occurring monomer domains, altered monomer domains (i.e., monomer domain variants), or a combinations thereof.

In some embodiments, monomer domains are identified or selected for a desired property (e.g., binding affinity) and then the monomer domains are formed into multimers. See FIG. 6. For those embodiments, any method resulting in selection of domains with a desired property (e.g., a specific binding property) can be used. For example, the methods can comprise providing a plurality of different nucleic acids, each nucleic acid encoding a monomer domain; translating the plurality of different nucleic acids, thereby providing a plurality of different monomer domains; screening the plurality of different monomer domains for binding of the desired ligand or a mixture of ligands; and, identifying members of the plurality of different monomer domains that bind the desired ligand or mixture of ligands.",

For example, non-recombinant monomer domains can include human monomer domains or optionally, domains derived from different species or sources, e.g., mammals, primates, rodents, fish, birds, reptiles, plants, etc. Non-recombinant monomer domains can be obtained by a number of methods, e.g., by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA.",

For example, ancestral domains can be based on phylogenetic analysis. Chimeric domains are domains in which one or more regions are replaced by corresponding regions from other domains of the same family. For example, chimeric domains can be constructed by combining loop sequences from multiple related domains of the same family to form novel domains with potentially lowered immunogenicity. Those of skill in the art will recognize the immunologic benefit of constructing modified binding domain monomers by combining loop regions from various related domains of the same family rather than creating random amino acid sequences. For example, by constructing variant domains by combining loop sequences or even multiple loop sequences that occur naturally in human LDL receptor class A-domains, the resulting domains may contain novel binding properties but may not contain any immunogenic protein sequences because all of the exposed loops are of human origin. The combining of loop amino acid sequences in endogenous context can be applied to all of the monomer constructs disclosed herein. Thus also provided is a method for generating a library of chimeric monomer domains derived from human proteins, the method comprising: providing loop sequences corresponding to at least one loop from each of at least two different naturally occurring variants of a human protein, wherein the loop sequences are polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences; and covalently combining loop sequences to generate a library of at least two different chimeric sequences, wherein each chimeric sequence encodes a chimeric monomer domain having at least two loops. Typically, a chimeric domain has at least four loops, and usually at least six loops. As described above, the present disclosure provides three types of loops that are identified by specific features, such as, potential for disulfide bonding, bridging between secondary protein structures, and molecular dynamics (i.e., flexibility). The three types of loop sequences are a cysteine-defined loop sequence, a structure-defined loop sequence, and a B-factor-defined loop sequence.",

                                "The present disclosure provides binding proteins that comprise one or more monomers. In particular, methods, compositions and kits, as well as discrete monomer domains that bind to FGFR1c and/or \u03b2-Klotho, and which can form elements of a multimer (also known as a combinatorial mosaic protein or a recombinant mosaic protein) comprising two or more monomer domains that are joined via a linker are described. The multimers can be screened to identify those that have an improved phenotype such as improved avidity or affinity or altered specificity for the ligand or the mixture of ligands, compared to the discrete monomer domain; multimers identified using these and other approaches are provided.",
                                "Monomer domains can be of any size. In some embodiments, monomer domains have about 25 to about 500, about 30 to about 200, about 30 to about 100, about 35 to about 50, about 35 to about 100, about 90 to about 200, about 30 to about 250, about 30 to about 60, about 9 to about 150, about 100 to about 150, about 25 to about 50, or about 30 to about 150 amino acids. Similarly, a monomer domain can comprise, e.g., from about 30 to about 200 amino acids; from about 25 to about 180 amino acids; from about 40 to about 150 amino acids; from about 50 to about 130 amino acids; or from about 75 to about 125 amino acids. Monomer domains can typically maintain a stable conformation in solution, and are often heat stable, e.g., stable at 95\u00b0 C. for at least 10 minutes without losing binding affinity. In some embodiments, monomer domains can fold independently into a stable conformation. In one embodiment, the stable conformation is stabilized by ions (e.g., such as metal or calcium ions). The stable conformation can optionally contain disulfide bonds (e.g., at least one, two, or three or more disulfide bonds). The disulfide bonds can optionally be formed between two cysteine residues. In some embodiments, monomer domains, or monomer domain variants, are substantially identical to the sequences exemplified.",
                                "As described herein, monomer domains can be cysteine rich. Suitable cysteine rich monomer domains include, e.g., the LDL receptor class A domain (\u201cA-domain\u201d) or the EGF-like domain. The monomer domains can also have a cluster of negatively charged residues. Specifically, the A-domains (sometimes called \u201ccomplement-type repeats\u201d) contain about 30-50 or 30-65 amino acids. In some embodiments, the domains comprise about 35-45 amino acids and in some cases about 40 amino acids. Within the 30-50 amino acids, there are an even number of cysteine residues, typically about 6 cysteine residues. Of the six cysteines, disulfide bonds typically are found between the following cysteines: C1 and C3, C2 and C5, C4 and C6. The A domain constitutes a ligand binding moiety. The cysteine residues of the domain are disulfide linked to form a compact, stable, functionally independent moiety. Clusters of these repeats make up a ligand binding domain, and differential clustering can impart specificity with respect to the ligand binding.",
                                "Other features of monomer domains include the ability to bind ligands (e.g., as in the LDL receptor class A domain, or the CUB domain (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein-1 domain), the ability to participate in endocytosis or internalization (e.g., as in the cytoplasmic tail of the LDL receptor or the cytoplasmic tail of Megalin), the ability to bind an ion (e.g., Ca2+ binding by the LDL receptor A-domain), and/or the ability to be involved in cell adhesion (e.g., as in the EGF-like domain). Other monomer domains that bind ions to maintain their secondary structure include, e.g., A domain, EGF domain, EF Hand (e.g., such as those found in present in calmodulin and troponin C), Cadherin domain, C-type lectin, C2 domain, Annexin, Gla-domain, Trombospondin type 3 domain, all of which bind calcium, and zinc fingers (e.g., C2H2 type C3HC4 type (RING finger), Integrase Zinc binding domain, PHD finger, GATA zinc finger, FYVE zinc finger, B-box zinc finger), which bind zinc.",
                                "Characteristics of a monomer domain include the ability to fold independently and the ability to form a stable structure. Thus, the structure of the monomer domain is often conserved, although the polynucleotide sequence encoding the monomer need not be conserved. For example, the A-domain structure is conserved among the members of the A-domain family, while the A-domain nucleic acid sequence is not. Thus, for example, a monomer domain is classified as an A-domain by its cysteine residues and its affinity for calcium, not necessarily by its nucleic acid sequence.",
                                "As described herein, monomer domains can be selected for the ability to bind to targets other than the target that a homologous naturally occurring domain can bind. Thus, in some embodiments, monomer domains (and multimers comprising such monomers) are provided that do not bind to the target or the class or family of target proteins that a homologous naturally occurring domain can bind.",

A portion of FGFR1c can comprise, e.g., at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, or more contiguous amino acids of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, the monomers will bind to FGFR1c with a affinity stronger than 10\u22123 M (e.g, 10\u22124M, etc.). In some embodiments, the affinity is stronger than 10\u22124 M, 10\u22125 M, 10\u22126 M, 10\u22127 M, 10\u22128 M, 10\u22129 M or 10\u221210 M.",

In one embodiment, the method comprises first providing a monomer domain that has been identified as a binding protein that specifically binds to a half-life extender such as a blood-carried molecule or cell, such as serum albumin (e.g., human serum albumin), IgG, red blood cells, etc. The half-life extender-binding monomer is then covalently linked to another monomer domain that has a binding affinity for a protein of interest (e.g., FGFR1c, \u03b2-Klotho or both FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho, or a different target). This complex formation results in the half-life extension protecting the multimer and/or bound protein(s) from proteolytic degradation and/or other removal of the multimer and/or protein(s) and thereby extending the half-life of the protein and/or multimer. One variation of this use of the binding proteins disclosed herein includes the half-life extender-binding monomer covalently linked to the protein of interest.

Multimers, which comprise some of the binding proteins described herein, comprise at least two monomer domains (e.g., a domain that binds to FGFR1c and a domain that binds to \u03b2-Klotho, two domains that bind \u03b2-Klotho or two domains that bind FGFR1c). For example, multimers can comprise from 2 to about 10 monomer domains, from 2 and about 8 monomer domains, from about 3 and about 10 monomer domains, about 7 monomer domains, about 6 monomer domains, about 5 monomer domains, or about 4 monomer domains. In some embodiments, the multimer comprises 3 or at least 3 monomer domains. In some embodiments, the multimers have no more than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 monomer domains. In view of the possible range of monomer domain sizes, the multimers can be, e.g., less than 100 kD, less than 90 kD, less than 80 kD, less than 70 kD, less than 60 kD, less than 50 kD, less than 40 kD, less than 30 kD, less than 25 kD, less than 20 kD, less than 15 kD, less than 10 kD or can be smaller or larger. In some cases, the monomer domains have been pre-selected for binding to a target molecule of interest (e.g., FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho). In some embodiments, the multimers will bind to FGFR1c, \u03b2-Klotho or both FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho (or, e.g., a blood factor such as HSA or IgG) with an affinity of less than 10\u22123 M (i.e., binds stronger than an affinity of 10\u22123 M). In some embodiments, the affinity is less than 10\u22124 M, 10\u22125 M, 10\u22126 M, 10\u22127 M, 10\u22128 M, 10\u22129 M, or 10\u221210 M. In some embodiments, the affinity of a multimer will be stronger (less) than the sum of affinities of the respective monomer domains in the multimer.",

In some of these embodiments, each monomer binds to a different position (analogous to an epitope) on a target molecule. Multiple monomer domains that bind to the same target molecule results in an avidity effect resulting in improved affinity of the multimer for the target molecule compared to the affinity of each individual monomer. In some embodiments, the multimer has an affinity of at least about 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1000 times the affinity of a monomer domain alone. In some embodiments, at least one, two, three, four or more (e.g., all) monomers of a multimer bind an ion such as calcium or another ion.",
                                "Multimers can comprise a variety of combinations of monomer domains. For example, in a single multimer, the monomer domains can be identical (e.g., two or more identical domains that bind to FGFR1c, or two or more identical domains that bind to \u03b2-Klotho) or different (e.g., one or more domains that binds to FGFR1c and one or more domain(s) that bind to \u03b2-Klotho). In addition, the selected monomer domains can comprise various different monomer domains from the same monomer domain family, or various monomer domains from different domain families, or optionally, a combination of both. For example, the monomer domains can be selected from Families 1-3 of FGFR1c-binding monomer domains or Families 4-10 of the \u03b2-Klotho-binding monomer domains. In some embodiments, at least one of the monomer domains is selected from Families 1-3 (FGFR1c-binding monomers) and another monomer domain is selected from Families 4-10 (\u03b2-Klotho-binding monomers). Exemplary FGFR1c-, \u03b2-Klotho- and bispecific FGFR1c- and \u03b2-Klotho-binding dimers are provided herein.",

Exemplary target molecules include, e.g., a serum molecule that extends the serum half-life of the multimer (e.g., an immunoglobulin or serum albumin). Exemplary molecules that extend the serum half-life of a multimer include, e.g., red blood cells (i.e., erythrocytes), IgG, and serum albumin such as HSA. An example of a multimer can include, e.g., a monomer domain from Families 1-3 of the FGFR1c binding domains and a monomoer from Families 4-19 of the \u03b2-Klotho-binding domains (and optionally 2, 3, 4, or more FGFR1c and/or \u03b2-Klotho binding domains) and an immunoglobulin binding monomer domain.",

Thus, multimers can have at least one immuno-domain such as a minibody, a single-domain antibody, a single chain variable fragment (ScFv), or a Fab fragment; and at least one monomer domain, such as, for example, an EGF-like domain, a Kringle-domain, a fibronectin type I domain, a fibronectin type II domain, a fibronectin type III domain, a PAN domain, a Gla domain, a SRCR domain, a Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin Inhibitor domain, a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain, a Trefoil (P-type) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C domain, an Anaphylatoxin-like domain, a CUB domain, a thyroglobulin type I repeat, LDL-receptor class A domain, a Sushi domain, a Link domain, a Thrombospondin type I domain, an Immunoglobulin-like domain, a C-type lectin domain, a MAM domain, a von Willebrand factor type A domain, a Somatomedin B domain, a WAP-type four disulfide core domain, a F5/8 type C domain, a Hemopexin domain, an SH2 domain, an SH3 domain, a Laminin-type EGF-like domain, a C2 domain, or variants thereof.",
                                "Domains need not be selected before the domains are linked to form multimers. On the other hand, the domains can be selected for the ability to bind to a target molecule before being linked into multimers.

In some embodiments, a continuous flow heating process to purify the monomers or multimers from bacterial cell cultures is used. For example, a cell suspension can be passed through a stainless steel coil submerged in a water bath set to a temperature resulting in lysis of the bacteria (e.g., about 65-100 degrees C.). The lysed effluent is routed to a cooling bath to obtain rapid cooling and prevent renaturation of denatured E. coli proteins. E. coli proteins denature and are prevented from renaturing, but the monomer or multimers do not denature under these conditions due to the exceptional stability of their scaffold. The heating time can be controlled by adjusting the flow rate and length of the coil. This approach yields active proteins with high yield and exceptionally high purity (e.g., >80%, >85%, >90%, >95%, >96%, >97%, >98%, or >99%) compared to alternative approaches and is amenable to large scale production of clinical material.",

In this regard, any method resulting in selection of domains with a desired property (e.g., a specific binding property) can be used. For example, the methods can comprise providing a plurality of different nucleic acids, each nucleic acid encoding a monomer domain; translating the plurality of different nucleic acids, thereby providing a plurality of different monomer domains; screening the plurality of different monomer domains for binding of the desired ligand or a mixture of ligands; and, identifying members of the plurality of different monomer domains that bind the desired ligand or mixture of ligands.",
                                "In addition, any method of mutagenesis, such as site-directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis (e.g., chemical mutagenesis) can be used to produce monomer domains, e.g., for a monomer domain library. In some embodiments, error-prone PCR can be employed to create variants. Additional methods include aligning a plurality of naturally occurring monomer domains by aligning conserved amino acids in the plurality of naturally occurring monomer domains; and, designing the recombinant monomer domain by maintaining the conserved amino acids and inserting, deleting or altering amino acids around the conserved amino acids to generate the recombinant monomer domain. In one embodiment, the conserved amino acids comprise cysteines. In another embodiment, the inserting step uses random amino acids, or optionally, the inserting step uses portions of the naturally occurring monomer domains. The portions can ideally encode loops from domains from the same family. Amino acids are inserted or exchanged using synthetic oligonucleotides, or by shuffling, or by restriction enzyme based recombination. Human chimeric domains of the present disclosure can be employed in therapeutic applications where minimal immunogenicity is desired. The present disclosure provides methods for generating libraries of human chimeric domains. Human chimeric monomer domain libraries can be constructed by combining loop sequences from different variants of a human monomer domain, as described above. The loop sequences that are combined can be sequence-defined loops, structure-defined loops, B-factor-defined loops, or a combination of any two or more thereof.",
                                "Alternatively, a human chimeric domain library can be generated by modifying naturally-occurring human monomer domains at the amino acid level, as compared to the loop level. In some embodiments, to minimize the potential for immunogenicity, only those residues that naturally occur in protein sequences from the same family of human monomer domains are utilized to create the chimeric sequences. This can be achieved by providing a sequence alignment of at least two human monomer domains from the same family of monomer domains, identifying amino acid residues in corresponding positions in the human monomer domain sequences that differ between the human monomer domains, generating two or more human chimeric monomer domains, wherein each human chimeric monomer domain sequence consists of amino acid residues that correspond in type and position to residues from two or more human monomer domains from the same family of monomer domains. Libraries of human chimeric monomer domains can be employed to identify human chimeric monomer domains that bind to a target of interest by screening the library of human chimeric monomer domains for binding to a target molecule, and identifying a human chimeric monomer domain that binds to the target molecule. Suitable naturally-occurring human monomer domain sequences employed in the initial sequence alignment step include those corresponding to any of the naturally-occurring monomer domains described herein.",

Methods particularly suitable for generating these libraries are split-pool format and trinucleotide synthesis format as described in WO01/23401, incorporated herein by reference.",
                                "In some embodiments, monomer domains of the disclosure are screened for potential immunogenicity by:\n\n\n- - (a) providing a candidate protein sequence;\n  - (b) comparing the candidate protein sequence to a database of human\n    protein sequences;\n  - (c) identifying portions of the candidate protein sequence that\n    correspond to portions of human protein sequences from the database;\n    and\n  - (d) determining the extent of correspondence between the candidate\n    protein sequence and the human protein sequences from the database.",
                                "In general, the greater the extent of correspondence between the candidate protein sequence and one or more of the human protein sequences from the database, the lower the potential for immunogenicity is predicted as compared to a candidate protein having little correspondence with any of the human protein sequences from the database. A database of human protein sequences that is suitable for use in the practice of the invention method for screening candidate proteins can be found at the website for the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This website provides the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm as a resource that can be used to find regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. Databases available for comparison contain sequence information from whole genomes of many vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, fungi, protozoan, prokaryotic and archaean species. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families. A second tool available at NCBI, COBALT (constraint-based alignment tool) allows the simultaneous alignment of multiple sequences that can be applied to database searches. These methods are particularly useful in determining whether a crossover sequence in a chimeric protein, such as, for example, a chimeric monomer domain, is likely to cause an immunogenic event. If the crossover sequence corresponds to a portion of a sequence found in the database of human protein sequences, it is possible that the crossover sequence is less likely to cause an immunogenic event.",
                                "Information pertaining to portions of human protein sequences from the database can be used to design a protein library of human-like chimeric proteins. Such library can be generated by using information pertaining to \u201ccrossover sequences\u201d that exist in naturally occurring human proteins. As used herein the term \u201ccrossover sequence\u201d refers to a sequence that is found in its entirety in at least one naturally occurring human protein, in which portions of the sequence are found in two or more naturally occurring proteins. Thus, recombination of the latter two or more naturally occurring proteins would generate a chimeric protein in which the chimeric portion of the sequence actually corresponds to a sequence found in another naturally occurring protein. The crossover sequence contains a chimeric junction of two consecutive amino acid residue positions in which the first amino acid position is occupied by an amino acid residue identical in type and position found in a first and second naturally occurring human protein sequence, but not a third naturally occurring human protein sequence. The second amino acid position is occupied by an amino acid residue identical in type and position found in a second and third naturally occurring human protein sequence, but not the first naturally occurring human protein sequence. In other words, the \u201csecond\u201d naturally occurring human protein sequence corresponds to the naturally occurring human protein in which the crossover sequence appears in its entirety, as described above.",

Alternatively, if the first naturally-occurring human protein sequence is D-E-F-G, and the second is B-C-D-E-F, and the third is A-B-C-D, then the chimeric junction is D-E. Human-like chimeric protein molecules can be generated in a variety of ways. For example, oligonucleotides comprising sequences encoding the chimeric junctions can be recombined with oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to two or more subsequences from the above-described set of subsequences to generate a human-like chimeric protein, and libraries thereof. The reference sequence used to align the naturally occurring human proteins is a sequence from the same family of naturally occurring human proteins, or a chimera or other variant of proteins in the family.",

The fragments and the monomer domain can also be recombined by manipulating nucleic acids encoding domains or fragments thereof. For example, ligating a nucleic acid construct encoding fragments of the monomer domain can be used to generate an altered monomer domain.",

Similarly, the sequence diversity of one or more monomer domains can be expanded by mutating the monomer domain(s) with site-directed mutagenesis, random mutation, pseudorandom mutation, defined kernal mutation, codon-based mutation, and the like. The resultant nucleic acid molecules can be propagated in a host for cloning and amplification. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are shuffled.",

Selected monomer domain nucleic acids can also be back-crossed by shuffling with polynucleotide sequences encoding neutral sequences (i.e., sequences having an insubstantial functional effect on binding), such as for example, by back-crossing with a wild-type or naturally-occurring sequence substantially identical to a selected sequence to produce native-like functional monomer domains. Generally, during back-crossing, subsequent selection is applied to retain the property, e.g., binding to the ligand.",

In such a case, monomer domains are isolated and shuffled to combinatorially recombine the nucleic acid sequences that encode the monomer domains (recombination can occur between or within monomer domains, or both). The first step involves identifying a monomer domain having the desired property, e.g., affinity for a certain ligand. While maintaining the conserved amino acids during the recombination, the nucleic acid sequences encoding the monomer domains can be recombined, or recombined and joined into multimers.",

No prior information regarding ligand structure is required to isolate the monomer domains of interest or the multimers of interest. The monomer domains and/or multimers identified can have biological activity, which is meant to include at least specific binding affinity for a selected or desired ligand, and, in some instances, will further include the ability to block the binding of other compounds, to stimulate or inhibit metabolic pathways, to act as a signal or messenger, to stimulate or inhibit cellular activity, and the like. Monomer domains can also be generated to function as ligands for receptors where the natural ligand for the receptor has not yet been identified (orphan receptors). These orphan ligands can be created to either block or activate the receptor to which they bind.",

The monomer domain sequences can then be mutagenized (e.g., recombined, chemically altered, etc.) or otherwise altered and the new monomer domains can be screened again for binding to the ligand or the mixture of ligands with an improved affinity. The selected monomer domains can be combined or joined to form multimers, which can then be screened for an improved affinity or avidity or altered specificity for the ligand or the mixture of ligands.

                                "Preliminary screens can be conducted by screening for agents capable of binding to FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho. The binding assays can involve contacting an FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho protein (or a fragment thereof) with one or more test agents (i.e., monomers or multimers disclosed herein) and allowing sufficient time for the protein and test agents to form a binding complex. Any formed binding complexes can be detected using any of a number of established analytical techniques. Protein binding assays include, but are not limited to, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), Alphascreen (amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay), immunohistochemical binding assays, flow cytometry or other assays. The FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho proteins utilized in such assays can be naturally expressed, cloned or synthesized. Similar methods can be used to identify monomer domains or multimers that bind IgG or HSA.",
                                "The screening methods disclosed herein can be performed as in vitro or cell-based assays. Cell-based assays can be performed in any cells in which FGFR1c, \u03b2-Klotho or both FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho is expressed. Cell-based assays can involve whole cells or cell fractions containing FGFR1c and/or \u03b2-Klotho to screen for agent binding or modulation of activity by the agent. Exemplary cell types that can be used according to the methods disclosed herein include, e.g., any mammalian cells, as well as fungal cells, including yeast, and bacterial cells. Cells can be primary cells or tumor cells or other types of immortal cell lines. Of course, FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho can be recombinantly expressed in cells that do not endogenously contain FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho.",
                                "FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho activity assays can also be used to identify a modulator (antagonist or agonist) of FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho. Additionally, activity assays to identify modulators of FGF21-mediated activity, such as those described in the Examples, can also be employed. In these embodiments, one or more test agents are contacted to a cell expressing FGFR1c, or both FGFR1c and \u03b2-Klotho, and then tested for FGFR1c-, or FGF21-mediated activity, respectively. In order to determine that the modulator has \u03b2-Klotho dependent activity (a characteristic of FGF-21) it is necessary to show that it can induce agonist activity on cells co-expressing a member of the FGFR family (FGFR1c, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4) and \u03b2-Klotho (see, e.g., FIG. 37). Exemplary FGFR1c-mediated activities include activation of luciferase expression under the control of an ERK pathway sensitive promoter in response to FGF-1 in the absence of \u03b2-Klotho (see, e.g., FIG. 46) and exemplary FGF21-mediated activities include activation of luciferase expression under the control of an ERK pathway sensitive promoter in response to FGF-21 in the presense of \u03b2-Klotho (see, e.g., FIGS. 30 and 31, 33 to 35, 38, 45, and 47 to through 49). In other embodiments, downstream molecular events can also be monitored to determine signaling activity. For example, FGF21-mediated signal transduction is mediated by the ERK pathway and various methods are known to measure signaling through the ERK pathway, including those disclosed herein, e.g., in Examples 9, 10 and 11.",
                                "In some embodiments, activity assays, such as those disclosed herein in Example 9, can also used to confirm that identified agonist monomers or multimers (e.g., those that bind to both FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho) lack antagonist activity (i.e., that they do not block FGF21-mediated signaling).",
                                "Agents that are initially identified by any of the foregoing screening methods can be further tested to validate the apparent activity. Such studies can be conducted with suitable animal models. The basic format of such methods involves administering an agent of interest identified during an initial screen to an animal that serves as a model for humans and then determining if FGF21-mediated signaling is in fact modulated and/or a desired physiological effect is observed (e.g., lowering of blood glucose levels, blood insulin levels or blood lipid levels) and/or a disease or condition is ameliorated (e.g., diabetes or obesity). The animal models utilized in validation studies generally are mammals of any kind. Specific examples of suitable animals include, but are not limited to, non-human primates (including cynomolgous and rhesus monkeys), mice and rats.",
                                "Selection of monomer domains that bind FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho from a library of domains can be accomplished using any of a variety of procedures. For example, one method of identifying monomer domains which have a desired property (e.g., binding FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho or IgG) involves translating a plurality of nucleic acids, where each nucleic acid encodes a monomer domain, screening the polypeptides encoded by the plurality of nucleic acids, and identifying those monomer domains that, e.g., bind to a desired ligand or mixture of ligands, thereby producing a selected monomer domain. The monomer domains expressed by each of the nucleic acids can be tested for their ability to bind to the ligand by methods known in the art (e.g., panning, affinity chromatography, ELISA, Alphascreen, or FACS analysis, as are described herein).",
                                "As noted herein, the selection of monomer domains can be based on binding to a ligand such as FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho, or a fragment thereof or other target molecule (e.g., lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid and the like). The ligand can be provided either as a recombinant purified protein, or expressed on the surface of a cell, such as a bacterial, fungal, insect or mammalian cell. Other molecules can optionally be included in the methods along with the target, e.g., ions such as Ca+2.",
                                "When a monomer domain is selected based on its ability to bind to a ligand, the selection basis can include selection based on a slow dissociation rate, which is usually predictive of high affinity. The valency of the ligand can also be varied to control the average binding affinity of selected monomer domains. The ligand can be bound to a surface or substrate at varying densities, such as by including a competitor compound, by dilution, or by other method known to those in the art. High density (valency) of predetermined ligand can be used to enrich for monomer domains that have relatively low affinity, whereas a low density (valency) can preferentially enrich for higher affinity monomer domains.",
                                "A variety of reporting display vectors or systems can be used to express nucleic acids encoding the monomer domains and/or multimers disclosed herein and to test for a desired activity. For example, a phage display system is a system in which monomer domains are expressed as fusion proteins on the phage surface (Pharmacia, Milwaukee Wis.). Phage display can involve the presentation of a polypeptide sequence encoding monomer domains on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage, typically as a fusion with a bacteriophage coat protein.",
                                "Generally in these methods, each phage particle or cell serves as an individual library member displaying a single species of displayed polypeptide in addition to the natural phage or cell protein sequences. The nucleic acids are cloned into the phage DNA at a site which results in the transcription of a fusion protein, a portion of which is encoded by the plurality of the nucleic acids. The phage containing a nucleic acid molecule undergoes replication and transcription in the cell. The leader sequence of the fusion protein directs the transport of the fusion protein to the tip of the phage particle. Thus, the fusion protein that is partially encoded by the nucleic acid is displayed on the phage particle for detection and selection by the methods described above and below. For example, the phage library can be incubated with a predetermined ligand such as FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho or a fragment thereof, so that phage particles which present a fusion protein sequence that binds to the ligand can be differentially partitioned from those that do not present polypeptide sequences that bind to the predetermined ligand. For example, the separation can be provided by immobilizing the predetermined ligand. The phage particles (i.e., library members) which are bound to the immobilized ligand are then recovered and replicated to amplify the selected phage subpopulation for a subsequent round of affinity enrichment and phage replication. After several rounds of affinity enrichment and phage replication, the phage library members that are thus selected are isolated and the nucleotide sequence encoding the displayed polypeptide sequence is determined, thereby identifying the sequence(s) of polypeptides that bind to the predetermined ligand. Such methods are further described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/17271, WO 91/18980, WO 91/19818 and WO 93/08278.",
                                "Examples of other display systems include ribosome displays, a nucleotide-linked display (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,281,344; 6,194,550, 6,207,446, 6,214,553, and 6,258,558), polysome display, cell surface displays and the like. The cell surface displays include a variety of cells, e.g., E. coli, yeast and/or mammalian cells. When a cell is used as a display, the nucleic acids, e.g., those obtained by PCR amplification followed by digestion, are introduced into the cell and translated. Optionally, polypeptides encoding the monomer domains or the multimers disclosed herein can be introduced, e.g., by injection, into the cell.",
                                "The monomer and multimer libraries of the present disclosure can be screened for a desired property such as binding of a desired ligand (e.g., FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho) or a mixture of ligands. For example, members of the library of monomer domains can be displayed and prescreened for binding to a known or unknown ligand or a mixture of ligands. The monomer domain sequences can then be mutagenized (e.g., recombined, chemically altered, etc.) or otherwise altered and the new monomer domains can be screened again for binding to the ligand or the mixture of ligands with an improved affinity. The selected monomer domains can be combined or joined to form multimers, which can then be screened for an improved affinity or avidity or altered specificity for the ligand or the mixture of ligands. Altered specificity can mean that the specificity is broadened, e.g., binding of multiple related ligands, or optionally, altered specificity can mean that the specificity is narrowed, e.g., binding within a specific region of a ligand. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are a number of methods available to calculate avidity. See, e.g., Mammen et al., Angew Chem Int. Ed. 37:2754-2794 (1998); Muller et al., Anal. Biochem. 261:149-158 (1998).",
                                "Those of skill in the art will recognize that the steps of generating variation and screening for a desired property can be repeated (i.e., performed recursively) to optimize results. For example, in a phage display library or other like format, a first screening of a library can be performed at relatively lower stringency, thereby selected as many particles associated with a target molecule as possible. The selected particles can then be isolated and the polynucleotides encoding the monomer or multimer can be isolated from the particles. Additional variations can then be generated from these sequences and subsequently screened at higher affinity.",
                                "All the compositions of the present disclosure, e.g., monomer domains as well as multimers and libraries thereof, can be optionally bound to a matrix of an affinity material. Examples of affinity material include beads, a column, a solid support, a microarray, other pools of reagent-supports, and the like.",
                                "When multimers capable of binding relatively large targets are desired, they can be generated by a \u201cwalking\u201d selection method, as was performed to generate a number of the disclosed binding proteins. This method is carried out by providing a library of monomer domains and screening the library of monomer domains for affinity to a first target molecule. Once at least one monomer that binds to the target is identified, that monomer is covalently linked to a new library or each remaining member of the original library of monomer domains. This new library of multimers (dimers) is then screened for multimers that bind to the target with an increased affinity, and a multimer that binds to the target with an increased affinity can be identified. The \u201cwalking\u201d monomer selection method provides a way to assemble a multimer that is composed of monomers that can act additively or even synergistically with each other given the restraints of linker length. This walking technique is very useful when selecting for and assembling multimers that are able to bind large target proteins with high affinity. The walking method can be repeated to add more monomers thereby resulting in a multimer comprising 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more monomers linked together. This \u201cwalking\u201d method was employed in the generation of \u03b2-Klotho-specific binding proteins, as described in Example 7.",
                                "In some embodiments, the selected multimer comprises more than two domains. Such multimers can be generated in a step fashion, e.g., where the addition of each new domain is tested individually and the effect of the domains is tested in a sequential fashion. See FIG. 7. In an alternate embodiment, domains are linked to form multimers comprising more than two domains and selected for binding without prior knowledge of how smaller multimers, or alternatively, how each domain, bind.",
                                "The methods of the present disclosure also include methods of evolving monomers or multimers. Intra-domain recombination can be introduced into monomers across the entire monomer or by taking portions of different monomers to form new recombined units. Interdomain recombination (e.g., recombining different monomers into or between multimers) or recombination of modules (e.g., multiple monomers within a multimer) can be achieved. Inter-library recombination is also contemplated.",
                                "Methods for evolving monomers or multimers can comprise, e.g., any or all of the following steps: providing a plurality of different nucleic acids, where each nucleic acid encoding a monomer domain; translating the plurality of different nucleic acids, which provides a plurality of different monomer domains; screening the plurality of different monomer domains for binding of the desired ligand (e.g., FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho) or mixture of ligands; identifying members of the plurality of different monomer domains that bind the desired ligand or mixture of ligands, which provides selected monomer domains; joining the selected monomer domains with at least one linker to generate at least one multimer, wherein the at least one multimer comprises at least two of the selected monomer domains and the at least one linker; and, screening the at least one multimer for an improved affinity or avidity or altered specificity for the desired ligand or mixture of ligands as compared to the selected monomer domains.",
                                "Variation can be introduced into either monomers or multimers. An example of improving monomers includes intra-domain recombination in which two or more (e.g., three, four, five, or more) portions of the monomer are amplified separately under conditions to introduce variation (for example by shuffling or other recombination method) in the resulting amplification products, thereby synthesizing a library of variants for different portions of the monomer. By locating the 5\u2032 ends of the middle primers in a \u201cmiddle\u201d or \u201coverlap\u201d sequence that both of the PCR fragments have in common, the resulting \u201cleft\u201d side and \u201cright\u201d side libraries can be combined by overlap PCR to generate novel variants of the original pool of monomers. These new variants can then be screened for desired properties, e.g., panned against a target or screened for a functional effect. The \u201cmiddle\u201d primer(s) can be selected to correspond to any segment of the monomer, and will typically be based on the scaffold or one or more consensus amino acids within the monomer (e.g., cysteines such as those found in A domains).",
                                "Similarly, multimers can be created by introducing variation at the monomer level and then recombining monomer variant libraries. On a larger scale, multimers (single or pools) with desired properties can be recombined to form longer multimers. In some cases variation is introduced (typically synthetically) into the monomers or into the linkers to form libraries. This can be achieved, e.g., with two different multimers that bind to two different targets, thereby eventually selecting a multimer with a portion that binds to one target and a portion that binds a second target.",
                                "Additional variation can be introduced by inserting linkers of different length and composition between domains. This allows for the selection of optimal linkers between domains. In some embodiments, optimal length and composition of linkers will allow for optimal binding of domains. In some embodiments, the domains with a particular binding affinity(s) are linked via different linkers and optimal linkers are selected in a binding assay. For example, domains are selected for desired binding properties and then formed into a library comprising a variety of linkers. The library can then be screened to identify optimal linkers. Alternatively, multimer libraries can be formed where the effect of domain or linker on target molecule binding is not known.",
                                "Methods of the present disclosure also include generating one or more selected multimers by providing a plurality of monomer domains. The plurality of monomer domains is screened for binding of a desired ligand or mixture of ligands. Members of the plurality of domains that bind the desired ligand or mixture of ligands are identified, thereby providing domains with a desired affinity. The identified domains are joined with at least one linker to generate the multimers, wherein each multimer comprises at least two of the selected domains and the at least one linker; and, the multimers are screened for an improved affinity or avidity or altered specificity for the desired ligand or mixture of ligands as compared to the selected domains, thereby identifying the one or more selected multimers.",
                                "Multimer libraries can be generated, in some embodiments, by combining two or more libraries or monomers or multimers in a recombinase-based approach, where each library member comprises as recombination site (e.g., a lox site). A larger pool of molecularly diverse library members in principle harbor more variants with desired properties, such as higher target-binding affinities and functional activities. When libraries are constructed in phage vectors, which can be transformed into E. coli, library size (typically 109-1010 members) is limited by the transformation efficiency of E. coli. A recombinase/recombination site system (e.g., the Cre-loxP system) and in vivo recombination can be exploited to generate libraries that are not limited in size by the transformation efficiency of E. coli.",
                                "For example, the Cre-loxP system can be used to generate dimer libraries with 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013 members, or even greater diversity. In some embodiments, E. coli as a host for one na\u00efve monomer library and a filamentous phage that carries a second na\u00efve monomer library are used. The library size in this case is limited only by the number of infective phage (carrying one library) and the number of infectible E. coli cells (carrying the other library). For example, infecting 1012 E. coli cells (1 L at OD600=1) with >1012 phage could produce as many as 1012 dimer combinations.",
                                "Selection of multimers can be accomplished using a variety of techniques including those mentioned above for identifying monomer domains. Other selection methods include, e.g., a selection based on an improved affinity or avidity or altered specificity for the ligand compared to selected monomer domains. For example, a selection can be based on selective binding to specific cell types, or to a set of related cells or protein types (e.g., different virus serotypes). Optimization of the property selected for, e.g., avidity of a ligand, can then be achieved by recombining the domains, as well as manipulating amino acid sequence of the individual monomer domains or the linker domain or the nucleotide sequence encoding such domains, as mentioned in the present disclosure.",
                                "One method for identifying multimers can be accomplished by displaying the multimers. As with the monomer domains, the multimers are optionally expressed or displayed on a variety of display systems, e.g., phage display, ribosome display, polysome display, nucleotide-linked display (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,281,344; 6,194,550, 6,207,446, 6,214,553, and 6,258,558) and/or cell surface display, as described above. Cell surface displays can include but are not limited to E. coli, yeast or mammalian cells. In addition, display libraries of multimers with multiple binding sites can be panned for avidity or affinity or altered specificity for a ligand or for multiple ligands.",
                                "Monomers or multimers can be screened for target binding activity in yeast cells using a two-hybrid screening assay. In this type of screen the monomer or multimer library to be screened is cloned into a vector that directs the formation of a fusion protein between each monomer or multimer of the library and a yeast transcriptional activator fragment (i.e., Gal4). Sequences encoding the \u201ctarget\u201d protein are cloned into a vector that results in the production of a fusion protein between the target and the remainder of the Gal4 protein (the DNA binding domain). A third plasmid contains a reporter gene downstream of the DNA sequence of the Gal4 binding site. A monomer that can bind to the target protein brings with it the Gal4 activation domain, thus reconstituting a functional Gal4 protein. This functional Gal4 protein bound to the binding site upstream of the reporter gene results in the expression of the reporter gene and selection of the monomer or multimer as a target binding protein. (see Chien et. al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 88:9578; Fields S, and Song O. (1989) Nature 340: 245) Using a two-hybrid system for library screening is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,238 (see also Silver S.C. and Hunt S. W. (1993) Mol. Biol. Rep. 17:155; Durfee et al. (1993) Genes Devel. 7:555; Yang et al. (1992) Science 257:680; Luban et al.

Another useful screening system is the E. coli/BCCP interactive screening system (Germino et al. (1993) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90:993; Guarente L. (1993) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90:1639).",
                                "Other variations include the use of multiple binding compounds, such that monomer domains, multimers or libraries of these molecules can be simultaneously screened for a multiplicity of ligands or compounds that have different binding specificity. Multiple predetermined ligands or compounds can be concomitantly screened in a single library, or sequential screening against a number of monomer domains or multimers. In one variation, multiple ligands or compounds, each encoded on a separate bead (or subset of beads), can be mixed and incubated with monomer domains, multimers or libraries of these molecules under suitable binding conditions. The collection of beads, comprising multiple ligands or compounds, can then be used to isolate, by affinity selection, selected monomer domains, selected multimers or library members. Generally, subsequent affinity screening rounds can include the same mixture of beads, subsets thereof, or beads containing only one or two individual ligands or compounds. This approach affords efficient screening, and is compatible with laboratory automation, batch processing, and high throughput screening methods.",

For example, multiple ligands can be screened in a simple mixture, in an array, displayed on a cell or tissue (e.g., a cell or tissue provides numerous molecules that can be bound by the monomer domains or multimers disclosed herein), and/or immobilized. The libraries of affinity agents can optionally be displayed on yeast or phage display systems. Similarly, if desired, the ligands (e.g., encoded in a cDNA library) can be displayed in a yeast or phage display system.",

The first portion is infected into bacteria, resulting in either plaques or bacterial colonies, depending on the type of phage used. The expressed phage are immobilized and then probed with ligands displayed in phage selected as described below.",

Phage that bind to the second portion are subsequently eluted and contacted to the immobilized phage described in the paragraph above. Phage-phage interactions are detected (e.g., using a monoclonal antibody specific for the ligand-expressing phage) and the resulting phage polynucleotides can be isolated.",

For example, when both the affinity agent and the ligand are displayed on a phage or yeast, the DNA from the pair can be isolated and sequenced. In some embodiments, polynucleotides specific for the ligand and affinity agent are amplified. Amplification primers for each reaction can include 5\u2032 sequences that are complementary such that the resulting amplification products are fused, thereby forming a hybrid polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of the affinity agent and at least a portion of the ligand.

In these embodiments, a first library of affinity agents (monomer domains or multimers) are panned against multiple ligands and the eluted affinity agents are linked to the first or a second library of affinity agents to form a library of multimeric affinity agents (e.g., comprising 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more monomers), which are subsequently panned against the multiple ligands. This method can be repeated to continue to generate larger multimeric affinity agents. Increasing the number of monomer domains may result in increased affinity and avidity for a particular target. Of course, at each stage, the panning is optionally repeated to enrich for significant binders. In some cases, walking will be facilitated by inserting recombination sites (e.g., lox sites) at the ends of monomers and recombining monomer libraries by a recombinase-mediated event.",

This results in altered multimers which then can be screened and selected for members that have an enhanced property compared to the selected multimer, thereby producing selected altered multimers. In view of the description herein, it is clear that the following process can be followed. Recombinant or non-recombinant monomer domains can be recombined or variants can be formed. Optionally the domains initially or later are selected for those sequences that are less likely to be immunogenic in the host for which they are intended. Optionally, a phage library comprising the recombined domains is panned for a desired affinity. Monomer domains or multimers expressed by the phage can be screened for IC50 for a target. Hetero- or homo-meric multimers can be selected. The selected polypeptides can be selected for their affinity to any target, including, e.g., hetero- or homo-multimeric targets.",

                                "An example of a mouse model useful for screening LDL receptor class A-domain derived binding proteins is described as follows. Gene clusters encoding the wild type human LDL receptor class A-domain monomers are amplified from human cells using PCR. Almost all of the 200 different A-domains can be amplified with only three separate PCR amplification reactions of about 7 kb each. These fragments are then used to generate transgenic mice according to the method described above. The transgenic mice will recognize the human A-domains as \u201cself,\u201d thus mimicking the \u201cselfness\u201d of a human with regard to A-domains. Individual A-domain-derived monomers or multimers are tested in these mice by injecting the A-domain-derived monomers or multimers into the mice, then analyzing the immune response (or lack of response) generated. The mice are tested to determine if they have developed a mouse anti-human response (MAHR). Monomers and multimers that do not result in the generation of a MAHR are likely to be non-immunogenic when administered to humans.",
                                "Historically, the MAHR test in transgenic mice is used to test individual proteins in mice that are transgenic for that single protein.

For example, many homology determination methods have been designed for comparative analysis of sequences of biopolymers, for spell checking in word processing, and for data retrieval from various databases. With an understanding of double-helix pair-wise complement interactions among four principal nucleobases in natural polynucleotides, models that simulate annealing of complementary homologous polynucleotide strings can also be used as a foundation of sequence alignment or other operations typically performed on the character strings corresponding to the sequences herein (e.g., word-processing manipulations, construction of figures comprising sequence or subsequence character strings, output tables, etc.). An example of a software package with GOs for calculating sequence similarity is BLAST, which can be adapted by inputting character strings corresponding to the sequences herein.",
                                "BLAST is described in Altschul et al., (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915).",
                                "An additional example of a useful sequence alignment algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng & Doolittle, (1987) J. Mol. Evol. 35:351-360. The method used is similar to the method described by Higgins & Sharp, (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153. The program can align, e.g., up to 300 sequences of a maximum length of 5,000 letters. The multiple alignment procedure begins with the pairwise alignment of the two most similar sequences, producing a cluster of two aligned sequences. This cluster can then be aligned to the next most related sequence or cluster of aligned sequences. Two clusters of sequences can be aligned by a simple extension of the pairwise alignment of two individual sequences. The final alignment is achieved by a series of progressive, pairwise alignments. The program can also be used to plot a dendogram or tree representation of clustering relationships. The program is run by designating specific sequences and their amino acid or nucleotide coordinates for regions of sequence comparison. For example, in order to determine conserved amino acids in a monomer domain family or to compare the sequences of monomer domains in a family, the sequence in question, or coding nucleic acids, are aligned to provide structure-function information.",

                                "Recombination can be used for intradomain optimization. For example a PCR overlap reaction can be used that recombines two or more segments of a single domain relative to each other. One can use two, three, four, five or more fragment overlap reactions in the same way as illustrated. This recombination process has many applications. One application is to recombine a large pool of hundreds of previously selected clones without sequence information. All that is needed for each overlap to work is one known region of (relatively) constant sequence that exists in the same location in each of the clones (fixed site approach). For A domains, typically these clones would have been derived from a library in which 20-25 amino acids distributed over all five inter-cysteine segments were randomized. The intra-domain recombination method can also be performed on a pool of sequence-related monomer domains by standard DNA recombination (e.g., Stemmer, Nature 370:389-391 (1994)) based on random fragmentation and reassembly based on DNA sequence homology, which does not require a fixed overlap site in all of the clones that are to be recombined.",
                                "Another application of this process is to create multiple separate, na\u00efve (meaning unpanned) libraries in each of which only one of the intercysteine loops is randomized, to randomize a different loop in each library. After panning of these libraries separately against the target, the selected clones are then recombined. From each panned library only the randomized segment is amplified by PCR and multiple randomized segments are then combined into a single domain, creating a shuffled library which is panned and/or screened for increased potency. This process can also be used to shuffle a small number of clones of known sequence.",
                                "Any common sequence can be used as a cross-over point. For A domains or other cysteine-containing monomers, the cysteine residues are logical places for the crossover. However, there are other ways to determine optimal crossover sites, such as computer modeling. Alternatively, residues with highest entropy, or the least number of intramolecular contacts, may also be good sites for crossovers.",

Compared to the native A-domain scaffold and the design that was used to construct library A1 (described previously) this approach: 1) keeps more of the existing residues in place instead of randomizing these potentially critical residues, and 2) inserts a string of amino acids of variable length of all 20 amino acids (NNK codon), such that the average number of inter-cysteine residues is extended beyond that of the natural A domain or the A1 library. The rate of tyrosine residues was increased by including tyrosine codons in the oligonucleotides, because tyrosines were found to be overrepresented in antibody binding sites, presumably because of the large number of different contacts that tyrosine can make. The oligonucleotides used in this PCR reaction are (SEQ ID NOS: 420-446, respectively, in order of appearance):",

Pool 1 contained oligonucleotides 1-9, pool 2 contained 10-17, pool 3 contained only 18 and pool 4 contained 19-27. The fully assembled library was obtained through an additional 8 cycles of PCR using pool 1 and 4. The library fragments were digested with XmaI and SfiI. The DNA fragments were ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of phage display vector fuse5-HA, a derivative of fuse5 carrying an in-frame HA-epitope. The ligation mixture was electroporated into TransforMax\u2122 EC 100\u2122 electrocompetent E. coli cells resulting in a library of 2\u00d7109 individual clones. Transformed E. coli cells were grown overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in 2\u00d7YT medium containing 20 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline. Phage particles were purified from the culture medium by PEG-precipitation and a titer of 1.1\u00d71013/ml was determined.

                                "One approach for optimizing multimer binding to targets involves optimization of monomers, multimers and linkers. First a library of monomers is panned for binding to the target (e.g., FGFR1c or \u03b2-Klotho). However, some of the monomers may bind at locations on the target that are far away from each other, such that the domains that bind to these sites cannot be connected by a linker peptide. It is therefore useful to create and screen a large library of homo- or heterotrimers from these monomers before optimization of the monomers. These trimer libraries can be screened, e.g., on phage (typical for heterotrimers created from a large pool of monomers) or made and assayed separately (e.g., for homotrimers). By this method, the best trimer is identified. The assays can include binding assays to a target or agonist or antagonist potency determination of the multimer in functional protein- or cell-based assays.",

For homomultimers, an increase in binding by the multimer compared to the monomer is an avidity effect.",

Based on the solution structure of the domain, adjacent residue positions can be identified which are likely to be able to cooperate in binding to a given target. Herein, such groups of adjacent residues are referred to as structural categories. As an example, four such categories have been identified through examination of the A-domain structure, designated Top, Bottom, Loop 1, and Loop 2. By designing libraries which only allow diversity within a given category, the theoretical sequence space allowed by a library can be significantly reduced, allowing for better coverage of the theoretical space by the physical library. Further, in the case of non-overlapping categories such as the Top and Bottom categories, half-domain sequences selected against different targets can be combined into a single sequence which would be able to bind simultaneously or alternatively to the selected targets. In either case, creating binding sites that occupy only half a domain allows for the creation of molecules that are half as large and would have half the number of immunogenic epitopes, reducing the risk of immunogenicity."

                                "Monomers that were subcloned into pEve (pEve/monomer) were multimerized in one of the two following ways. pEve/monomer plasmids (individually or in pools) were digested with either BsrDI or BpmI (NEB). The \u02dc1.1 kb BsrDI and \u02dc2.9 BpmI fragments were isolated from 1% agarose gels and purified with Qiagen QIAquick spin columns. Pools of each of the two fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB); subsequently, the ligation was purified with a Qiagen QIAquick spin column. Using the primers VS-For and EveNut described in the phage subcloning section above, the multimer coding sequences were PCR-amplified from the ligation. The PCR products were purified and digested with SfiI (NEB), followed by ligation with pEve and transformation of BL21 (DE3) E. coli. The other method to generate multimers is to amplify the monomers from pEve/monomer plasmids (individually or in pools) with the primers VS-For and EveNut as described above. The amplified monomers were purified, digested with either BsrDI or BpmI (NEB), and ligated to create multimers. The ligated products were amplified with VS-For and EveNut primers, followed by purification, digestion with SfiI, ligation with pEVE vector and transformation into BL21 (DE3) E. coli. The PCR products were purified and digested with SfiI (NEB), followed by ligation with pEve and transformation of BL21 (DE3) E. coli. This method created dimers comprised of different combinations of the starting monomers. This method can also be used to generate other multimers, such as trimers. When making trimers, pools of pEve/dimers and pEve/monomers are the starting materials. They are processed as above. A molecular biology procedure similar to that described below for making \u201cwalking libraries\u201d was also used to generate multimers. In all cases, proteins were expressed, purified and screened as above.",
                                "Additional libraries, referred to as \u201cwalking libraries,\u201d were generated by ligating phage display-selected monomers (i.e., selected monomers) with the full representation of a na\u00efve monomer library. These libraries were constructed in the following manner. PCR was used to amplify in two separate reactions: a) the coding sequences of the selected monomers with pETF (ACCCGTATGATGTTCCGGATTA; SEQ ID NO: 486)/pETB2r (GATGTATTCGGCCCCAGA GGCCTGCAATGAC; SEQ ID NO: 487); and b) the coding sequences of na\u00efve monomers in a monomer library with 21new1 (GAAATTCACCTCGAAAGCAA; SEQ ID NO: 488)/23 (ATGGGTTCCTATTGGGCT; SEQ ID NO: 489). The \u02dc200 bp products were isolated from a 3% agarose gel and purified with Qiagen QIAquick spin columns. Each product from (a) and (b) above was digested with either BsrDI or BpmI (NEB) in separate reactions. BpmI-digested monomers have an overhang which can be ligated to BsrDI-digested monomers. The purified digestion products were ligated to one another using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Ligation of BsrDI-cut na\u00efve monomers with BpmI-cut selected monomers generates a walking dimer library comprised of N-terminal na\u00efve monomers fused to C-terminal selected monomers. Ligation of BpmI-cut na\u00efve monomers with BsrDI-cut selected monomers generates a walking dimer library comprised of C-terminal na\u00efve monomers fused to N-terminal selected monomers. Primers pETF/pETB2r were used to PCR-amplify the ligated dimer coding sequences from the ligation, and the purified products were digested with SfiI followed by XmaI. The digested products were ligated to the phage vector fUSE5HA for the generation of a phage display dimer \u201cwalking library\u201d, typically with 108-109 unique members. A trimer (or larger multimer) \u201cwalking library\u201d can be generated in a similar fashion, except that the starting materials are dimers (or larger) and na\u00efve monomers.
