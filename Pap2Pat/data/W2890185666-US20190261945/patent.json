    "abstract": "For three-dimensional segmentation from two-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography imaging, the three-dimension segmentation is output by a machine-learnt multi-task generator. Rather than the brute force approach of training the generator from 2D ICE images to output a 2D segmentation, the generator is trained from 3D information, such as a sparse ICE volume assembled from the 2D ICE images. Where sufficient ground truth data is not available, computed tomography or magnetic resonance data may be used as the ground truth for the sample sparse ICE volumes. The generator is trained to output both the 3D segmentation and a complete volume (i.e., more voxels represented than in the sparse ICE volume). The 3D segmentation may be further used to project to 2D as an input with an ICE image to another network trained to output a 2D segmentation for the ICE image. Display of the 3D segmentation and/or 2D segmentation may guide ablation of tissue in the patient.",

                        "The present embodiments relate to segmentation in medical imaging to guide treatment of atrial fibrillation or other procedures. To treat atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation destroys the atypical tissues that trigger the abnormal heart rhythm. During catheter ablation, intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is often used to guide the intervention. Compared with other imaging modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, ICE provides better patient tolerance, requiring no general anesthesia.",
                        "Some gross morphological and architectural features of the left atrium (LA) are important to atrial fibrillation interventions. Due to the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) ICE and the difficulty in manual manipulation of the ICE transducer, these three-dimensional (3D) anatomical structures may not be sufficiently observed in certain views. This introduces difficulties to electrophysiologists as well as echocardiography image analysis algorithms that attempt automatic multi-component contouring or segmentation.",
                        "Existing approaches to 2D echocardiogram segmentation focus on a single cardiac chamber, such as the left ventricle or atrium. The segmentation distinguishes between the blood tissues and the endocardial structures. For multiple cardiac components (e.g., chambers and their surrounding structures) where the boundaries may not be clearly recognized, these 2D segmentation methods may fail. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in medical image analysis, including segmentation. However, training a CNN to directly generate segmentation masks from 2D ICE images does not demonstrate satisfactory performance, especially for the less-observed pulmonary veins. Such a baseline solely relies on the brute force of big data to cover all possible variations, which is difficult to achieve."

                        "Knowledge is integrated to boost contouring performance. Such knowledge stems from two sources: (i) 3D geometry information provided by a position sensor embedded inside an ICE catheter and 3D image appearance information exemplified by cross-modality computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) volumes that contain the same anatomical structures. The knowledge may be integrated from both sources with machine learning for a multi-task network to provide cross-modality volume completion and 3D+2D segmentation for intracardiac echocardiography contouring. The ICE information in 3D allows for at least an initial 3D contour, making the 2D contour more accurate. The use of a full or complete volume provided by the other modality assists in making the 3D contour more accurate. By performing both completion and 3D segmentation in one multi-task network, the resulting segmentation may be more accurate.",
                        "3D or 2D contouring may be provided despite the sparseness and noise in imaging with planar ICE images. Catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation increasingly relies on ICE for an anatomical delineation of the left atrium or ventricle of the heart and the pulmonary veins or other vessels that connect with the atrium or ventricle. It is a challenge to build an automatic contouring algorithm because ICE is noisy and provides only limited 2D views of the 3D anatomy. For an automatic solution to segment anatomy from ICE, the cross-modality solution leverages a database of diagnostic non-ultrasound images to supplement the less available interventional images.",
                        "In one embodiment, a deep neural network uses 3D geometrical information provided by a position sensor embedded in the ICE catheter and 3D image appearance information from a set of CT or MR cardiac volumes. The approach starts by using the 3D position information to form a 3D sparse volume based on the 2D ICE images. To leverage 3D image appearance information, the system performs a combined cross-modality volume completion to generate a pseudo CT or MR volume and generates a 3D segmentation. This achieves a collaborative structural understanding through a multi-task, volume-to-volume network with an adversarial formulation. In an additional step, an additional neural network generates a refined 2D segmentation taking as input both an original ICE image and a preliminary 2D segmentation projected from the 3D segmentation.",
                        "FIG. 1 is a flow chart diagram of one embodiment of a method for three-dimensional segmentation from two-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography imaging in a medical imaging system. Using 3D geometry knowledge from the position sensor, a 3D sparse volume based on the 2D ICE images is formed. Then, to tap into the 3D image appearance knowledge, a multi-task 3D network created with an adversarial formulation is applied. The network performs cross-modality volume completion and sparse volume segmentation simultaneously for collaborative structural understanding and consistency. Taking as inputs both the original 2D ICE image and the 2D mask projected from the generated 3D mask, a machine-learned network refines the 2D segmentation results.",
                        "The context of use is for treatment of atrial fibrillation under the guidance of ICE imaging. The left atrium may be the most common anatomy of interest for this context. FIG. 2 shows an example left atrium 20 and surrounding structure of interest. The structure includes the left atrial appendage (LAA) 26, left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) 25, left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) 28, right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) 22, and right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) 24. Additional, different, or fewer structures or parts of interest may be included. Any of the structures may be portions, such as a root or base of a vein. The left ventricle or other heart chambers may be the anatomy of interest in other embodiments. Other ICE imaging locations may result in other anatomy of interest, such as arteries or veins. The left atrium and the corresponding anatomy are used as examples below.",
                        "The method is performed in the order shown (e.g., top to bottom or numerical), but other orders may be used. For example, the display of act 14 does not occur until the display of act 17. Act 18 may be performed as part of repetition of acts 10-17, such as associated with ongoing imaging of act 10.",
                        "Additional, different or fewer acts may be provided. For example, acts 15-17 and/or 18 are not provided. In another example, act 14 is not provided as the 3D segment may be used for act 15 without display.",
                        "The method is performed by a medical diagnostic ultrasound scanner with one or more ablation systems. An ICE catheter and corresponding transducer connect with the scanner to perform act 10. A sensor on the ICE catheter or transducer is used to perform act 11. An image processor of the scanner performs acts 12, 13, 15, and 16, but a computer or server may perform the acts. The image processor in conjunction with a display device performs acts 14 and 17. The ablation system, such as a power source connected with an electrode in the catheter or another catheter, performs act 18. Other devices may be used to perform any of the acts.",
                        "In act 10, the ultrasound scanner uses an ICE catheter to image. The transducer of the ICE catheter scans a plane. The scan plane is oriented based on a position of the catheter. As the catheter moves (e.g., translates or rotates), different scan planes are scanned. Each scan generates a frame of data representing the scan plane at that time. The frame of ultrasound data may be scalar values or display values (e.g., RGB) in a polar coordinate or Cartesian coordinate format. The frame of ultrasound data may be a B-mode, color flow, or other ultrasound image.",
                        "A sequence of frames of data result from the ICE imaging. Each frame represents a 2D scan plane, so a collection of frames representing different 2D scan planes in the volume of and/or around the heart are acquired.",
                        "In act 11, a sensor senses the positions of the scan planes. A magnetic position sensor, fiducials with x-ray or acoustic scanning, or imager with image processing determines the location and orientation of the transducer for each frame. The location and orientation define the scan plane. The position of each scan plane is sensed. Different scan planes have different positions. The positions of the scan planes within a cardiac system (e.g., heart and/or vessels) of a patient are sensed for the ICE imaging of act 10.",
                        "The scanning defines the sample locations within each scan plane. The area covered by the ultrasound scanning and the position of the area in the heart volume are determined.",
                        "In act 12, an image processor forms an ICE volume from ultrasound data for the scan planes. The known locations represented by the ultrasound data are used to populate a volume. The sensed positions are used to assign scalar or other ultrasound data to different voxels. Alternatively, the sensed positions are used to align the planar locations represented by the ultrasound data within the volume. The ultrasound data is mapped to three dimensions using the positions of the scan planes.",
                        "The mapping forms a 3D sparse ICE volume using the location information associated with each ICE image. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 3, a set of 2D ICE images 30 are input, each including part of the heart in its field of view. The sensed 3D position is used to map all the 2D ICE images 30 to 3D space 32, thus forming a sparse ICE volume 34. The generated 3D sparse ICE volume 34 keeps the spatial relationships among individual ICE views.",
                        "The volume 34 is sparse due to the incomplete sampling of all voxel locations. Due to the user guided movement of the transducer and/or heart or other patient motion, less than all the volume is sampled in ICE imaging. Some fields of view may include only one or less than all the structures of interest. Once assembled as a volume, less than all voxels may be represented by the ultrasound data. A segmentation method uses the sparse volume for better anatomical understanding and structural consistency as compared to a single 2D ICE image. Due to the sparsity and noisy nature of ultrasound data, segmentation using just the sparse ICE volume may not be as accurate as desired for diagnosis and/or guiding ablation.",
                        "In act 13, the image processor generates a 3D segmentation from input of the ICE volume 34 to a machine-learned multi-task generator. The 3D segmentation is a labeling by voxel or location of different anatomy. The anatomy represented by each location is labeled. Alternatively, the segmentation forms a 3D mesh for each anatomy. Other segmentation results may be provided. The 3D segmentation provides a boundary for one or more structures in 3D. The segmentation is of one or more structures of interest, such as identifying the locations of a sub-set or all the anatomical structures of interest discussed above for FIG. 2 for the left atrium.",
                        "The 3D segmentation uses a machine-learned network. The ICE volume with or without other data are input to the machine-learned network and multiple outputs\u2014one a complete volume and the other a 3D segmentation\u2014are output in response. The machine-learned network is a multi-task network.",
                        "The machine-learned network is an image-to-image network, such as a generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN), trained to convert the ICE volume to the complete volume and the 3D segmentation. For example, the trained convolution units, weights, links, and/or other characteristics of the network are applied to the data of the ICE volume and/or derived feature values to extract the corresponding features through a plurality of layers and output the complete volume and the 3D segmentation. The features of the input are extracted from the ICE images as arranged in 3D. Other more abstract features may be extracted from those extracted features using the architecture. Depending on the number and/or arrangement of units or layers, other features are extracted from the input.",
                        "Any machine training architecture for outputting a spatial distribution from an input spatial distribution may be used. For example, U-Net is used. A convolutional-to-transposed-convolutional network is used. One segment of layers or units applies convolution to increase abstractness or compression. The most abstract feature values are then output to another segment. The other segment of layers or units then applies transposed-convolution to decrease abstractness or compression, resulting in outputting of an indication of class membership by location. The architecture may be a fully convolutional network.",
                        "A GAN includes a generator, such as the image-to-image or U-Net, and two or more discriminators. A discriminator is provided for each task of the multi-task network. The generator includes an encoder (convolutional) network and decoder (transposed-convolutional) network forming a \u201cU\u201d shape with a connection between passing features at a greatest level of compression or abstractness from the encoder to the decoder. Skip connections may be provided. Any now known or later developed U-Net architectures may be used. Other fully convolutional networks may be used.",
                        "For application for a given patient, the generator of the GAN is used without the discriminators. The GAN are applied to the patient ICE volume by the generator without the discriminators. The discriminators are used for training.",
                        "The GAN is a deep architecture, which may include convolutional neural network (CNN) or deep belief nets (DBN). Other deep networks may be used. CNN learns feed-forward mapping functions while DBN learns a generative model of data. In addition, CNN uses shared weights for all local regions while DBN is a fully connected network (i.e., having different weights for all regions of an image). The training of CNN is entirely discriminative through back-propagation. DBN, on the other hand, employs the layer-wise unsupervised training (e.g., pre-training) followed by the discriminative refinement with back-propagation if necessary.",
                        "The network is defined as a plurality of sequential feature units or layers. Sequential is used to indicate the general flow of output feature values from one layer to input to a next layer. The information from the next layer is fed to a next layer, and so on until the final output. The layers may only feed forward or may be bi-directional, including some feedback to a previous layer. The nodes of each layer or unit may connect with all or only a sub-set of nodes of a previous or subsequent layer or unit.",
                        "Within a unit or layer, any number of nodes is provided. For example, 100 nodes are provided. Later or subsequent units may have more, fewer, or the same number of nodes. The features of the nodes are learned by the machine using any building blocks. For example, auto-encoder (AE) or restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) approaches are used. AE transforms data linearly, and then applies a non-linear rectification, like a sigmoid function. The objective function of AE is the expected mean square error between the input image and reconstructed images using the learned features. AE may be trained using stochastic gradient descent or other approach to learn, by the machine, the features leading to the best reconstruction. The objective function of RBM is an energy function. Exact computation of the likelihood term associated with RBM is intractable. Therefore, an approximate algorithm, such as contrastive-divergence based on k-step Gibb sampling or other, is used to train the RBM to reconstruct the image from features.",
                        "Training of AE or RBM is prone to over-fitting for high-dimensional input data. Sparsity or denoising techniques (e.g., sparse denoising AE (SDAE)) are employed to constrain the freedom of parameters and force learning of interesting structures within the data. Enforcing sparsity within hidden layers (i.e., only a small number of units in hidden layers are activated at one time) may also regularize the network. In other embodiments, at least one unit is a convolution with ReLU activation or is a batch normalization with a ReLU activation followed by a convolution layer (BN+LeakyRU+convolution). Max pooling, upsampling, downsampling, and/or softmax layers or units may be used. Different units may be of the same or different type.",
                        "In one embodiment, the generator includes a U-Net with one or more skip connections. The skip connections 38 pass features from the encoder to the decoder at other levels of abstraction or resolution than the most abstract (i.e. other than the bottleneck). Skip connections provide more information to the decoding layers. A Fully Connected layer may be at the bottleneck of the network (i.e., between the encoder and decoder at a most abstract level of layers). The fully connected layer may make sure as much information as possible is encoded. Batch normalization may be added to stabilize the training.",
                        "The output or final layer of the architecture may form both outputs. One network may be used for both tasks. There are multiple outputs from the one network. There is one output for the segmentation of each anatomical structure and another output for the pseudo CT. One or more additional layers may be added in this framework to further process either the segmentation or pseudo CT outputs. In one embodiment, 5 down sampling blocks are followed by 5 up sampling blocks. Each down sampling block is a 3D convolution layer, followed by a batch normalization layer and a RELU layer. Each up-sampling block is a 3D deconvolution layer, followed by a batch normalization layer and a RELU layer. Skip connections are used to connect down sampling blocks and corresponding up sampling blocks. Drop out has been used. Alternatively, the output of the U-net is to two separate layers or networks. One or more layers are provided for each task. The layers for forming the complete volume from the output of the U-net are different than the layers for forming the 3D segmentation from the output of the U-net.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows an example method for machine training of 3D segmentation from 2D ICE imaging. The method is implemented by a machine (e.g., computer, processor, workstation, or server) using training data (e.g., samples and ground truths for the samples) in a memory.",
                        "The basic approach for training a GAN is to update the discriminators with both generated and real volumes or 3D segmentations, freeze weights in the discriminator, and then update the generator on how good the generator is at fooling the discriminators. Weights in the generator are updated while minimizing the binary cross entropy or other loss of the discriminators. In one embodiment, the GAN is trained from an initial state based on noise. In another embodiment, the generator is trained from initialized or conditional values created by pre-training or other training.",
                        "In act 40, a multi-task GAN is defined. The network architecture includes output layers for both tasks, volume completion and three-dimensional segmentation. Any image-to-image or GAN network architecture may be used, such as a U-net type of arrangement with downsampling and upsampling blocks or layers with or without skip connections. For multi-task GAN, the architecture includes two or more discriminator networks or layer arrangements. A discriminator network is provided for each of volume completion and 3D segmentation.",
                        "For training the machine-learned network, the machine learning network arrangement is defined. The definition is by configuration or programming of the learning. The number of layers or units, type of learning, and other characteristics of the network are controlled by the programmer or user. In other embodiments, one or more aspects (e.g., number of nodes, number of layers or units, or type of learning) are defined and selected by the machine during the learning.",
                        "FIG. 5 shows one example network architecture. The network includes a generator G3d for input and output of data representing three dimensions. The network includes two discriminators D3dc and Dads. The sparse ICE volume x is input to the generator and the discriminators. The generator G3d performs 3D segmentation and completion simultaneously and outputs a segmentation map G3ds(x) as well as a denser volume G3dC.",
                        "During training, the ground truth of G3dc is a CT or MR volume instead of a dense ICE volume. CT is used in the examples herein. A dense ICE volume may be used but are not typically available with a sufficient number of samples for machine training.",
                        "In act 42, the CT volumes from a first group of patients are assigned as ground truth volumes for ultrasound imaging of a second group of patients. The same or different CT volume is paired with different ones of the ICE volumes. The ICE images and the CT volumes are from different patients, but some of the samples for the training data may include ICE images and CT volumes from the same patients. Having the complete volume ground truth from one patient and the input sample ICE images from another patient provides for a cross-modality volume completion problem with unpaired data. Adversarial learning and pairing (e.g., mesh pairing) allow use of data from different modalities and patients.",
                        "To create samples for training, CT volumes are paired with ICE imaging samples. A collection of example CT volumes represents parts of the cardiac systems (e.g., hearts) of various patients.

The \u201c2D+3D\u201d model combines the advantages of the \u201c2D only\u201d and \u201c3D only\u201d model and in general yields the best performance. The IRR scores from human experts are relatively lower, especially for the LSPV and RSPV. This is expected as these two structures are difficult to view with ICE.
