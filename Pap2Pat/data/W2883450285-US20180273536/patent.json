                        "The T cell receptor (TCR), a heterodimer comprised of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains derived by recombination in the thymus, enables T cells to recognize non-self ligands presented in the context of conventional and non-conventional major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. Conventional MHC molecules have undergone divergent evolution to present a broad array of peptides However, the non-conventional CD1 molecules are highly conserved and present lipid and glycolipid antigens (Van Rhijn I et al, Nat Rev Immunol 15, 643-654 (2015); incorporated by reference herein). Like CD1, MR1 is a non-conventional MHC molecule that is highly conserved and located on human chromosome 1 (Riegert P et al, J Immunol 161, 4066-4077 (1998); incorporated by reference herein). CD1 presents small molecules from microbes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans (Gold M C et al, PLoS Biol 8 e1000407 (2010); Gold M C et al, J Exp Med 211, 1601-1610 (2014); Le Bourhis L et al, Nat Immunol 11, 701-708 (2010); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). MR1-restricted T cells (MR1Ts) are the T cell subset that recognizes these microbial small molecules bound to MR1 (Gold 2010 supra, Le Bourhis 2010 supra, Dusseaux M et al, Blood 117, 1250-1259 (2011); Kjer-Nielsen L et al, Nature 491, 717-723 (2012); Treiner E et al, Nature 422, 164-169 (2003); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs), a subset of human MR1Ts, were defined by the use of a semi-invariant T cell receptor that includes a single c chain rearrangement (TRAV1-2 and TRAJ33) paired with a limited number of 3 chains (TRBV6 and TRBV20) (Treiner 2003 supra). The use of a highly conserved antigen presentation molecule along with limited TCR diversity suggested that MAIT cells were limited to recognizing a small repertoire of ligands and unable to discriminate between ligands (Huang S et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106, 8290-8295 (2009); incorporated by reference herein).",
                        "That the known activating ligands for MAIT cells are solely derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, (Kjer-Nielsen 2012 supra, Corbett A J et al, Nature 509, 361-365 (2014); incorporated by reference herein), and that only microbes that synthesize riboflavin were initially demonstrated to stimulate MAIT cells was viewed as further proof of this restriction. Furthermore, the semi-invariant nature of the MAIT cell TCR has been used to argue that MAIT cells do not possess properties of immunologic memory, specifically antigen-driven clonal expansions reflective of antigenic exposure and persistence. However, recent evidence of diverse TCR usage among MR1T cells (Gold 2014 supra; Gherardin N A et al, Immunity 44, 32-45 (2016); Meermeier E W et al, Nat Commun 16, 12506 (2016); both of which are incorporated by reference herein) and structural flexibility in the MR1 binding pocket (Lopez-Sagaseta et al, J Immunol 191, 5268-5277 (2013); incorporated by reference herein) raise the possibility of ligand diversity and the ability to discriminate between specific microbes."

We found that the MR1 ligandome is unexpectedly broad, and demonstrate functionally distinct ligands derived from E. coli and M. smegmatis-infected cells. The identification, synthesis, and functional analysis of unique mycobacterial ligands reveals that novel MR1T ligands can be distinguished by MR1Ts with diverse TCR usage. These data suggest that MR1 serves as an immune sensor of the microbial ligandome.

The therapeutically effective dosage of the treatments for viral infection can be provided as repeated doses within a prolonged prophylaxis or treatment regimen that will yield clinically significant results to alleviate one or more symptoms or detectable conditions associated with a disease or condition characterized by neuronal injury.",

The effective amount of the agent will be dependent on several factors, including, but not limited to, the subject being treated and the manner of administration of the therapeutic composition. In one example, a therapeutically effective amount or concentration is one that is sufficient to prevent advancement, delay progression, or to cause regression of a disease or condition, or which is capable of reducing symptoms caused by any disease or condition, including a disease or condition characterized by neuronal injury.",

Suitable models in this regard include, for example, murine, rat, rabbit, porcine, feline, non-human primate, and other accepted animal model subjects known in the arts. Using such models, only ordinary calculations and adjustments are required to determine an appropriate concentration and dose to administer a therapeutically effective amount of the treatments for cancer immunotherapy and/or for infectious disease such as a mycobacterial or bacterial infection."

A chimeric version of soluble MR1 (hpMR1) comprised of human \u03b11 and \u03b12 sequences with bovine \u03b13 and \u03b22m sequences (FIG. 5A) was generated. The hpMR1 protein is stable and highly expressed (FIG. 5B), and recapitulates ligand binding and TCR interactions of human MR1 (FIG. 5C). Insect cells expressing hpMR1 were left uninfected or infected with live E. coli or M. smegmatis. hpMR1 expressed in the absence of any bacteria (hpMR1-bac), or following infection with either E. coli (hpMR1+EC) or M. smegmatis (hpMR1+MS), had distinctly different colors (FIG. 5D), suggesting a difference in the ligand repertoire.",

Previously, MR1 tetramers that identify MR1Ts by flow cytometry have been made from MR1 refolded in the presence of either 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribityluracil (5-OP-RU) or 5-(2-oxoethylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OE-RU) (Corbett 2014 supra). The disclosed approach produces tetramers comprised of hpMR1 monomers loaded with a heterogeneous population of media-, host cell-, and bacterially-derived ligands generated in the context of infection, and thus represent an unbiased, broad sampling of microbial MR1 ligands. Using a MR1T cell clone, it was demonstrated that hpMR1 tetramers could specifically stain MR1Ts (FIG. 6). Two complementary methods were then used to identify MR1Ts in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 donors: a) hpMR1+EC tetramer+ staining, and b) TRAV1-2+CD26+CD161+ triple staining.",
                                "It has been previously shown that TRAV1-2, CD161, and CD26 are sufficient to identify the same population of functional MAIT cells defined by the MR1 tetramer generated with the canonical 5-OP-RU ligand (Sharma P K et al, Immunology 145, 443-453 (2015); incorporated by reference herein; Meermeier 2016 supra).",
                                "The hpMR1+EC tetramer could delineate a distinct population of cells in PBMC of each of 15 donors tested (FIGS. 1A-1B). While we previously showed that the MR1/5-OP-RU tetramer stains cells that are nearly entirely TRAV1-2+ (Meermeier 2016 supra), hpMR1+EC tetramer+ cells, while still expressing CD26 and CD161 (FIG. 1C), were often TRAV1-2 negative (FIGS. 1A, 1D). These data support the hypothesis that MR1T cells, as defined by bacterially-loaded MR1 tetramers, can be distinguished from conventional MAIT cells. Furthermore, hpMR1 tetramers loaded with a heterogenous mixture of microbial ligands may identify MR1T cells that do not express the canonical TRAV1-2 TCR \u03b1 chain.",
                                "ELISPOT plate-bound hpMR1 tetramers were used to stimulate MR1T cell clones, based on an approach similar to that previously employed for CD1 (Bourgeois E A et al, J Exp Med 212, 149-163 (2015); de Jong A et al, Nat Immunol 15, 177-185 (2014); incorporated by reference herein), which we termed a tetraSPOT assay. Using the tetraSPOT assay, hpMR1+EC and +MS tetramers robustly stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production by a panel of MR1T clones expressing diverse TCR 3 and TRAJ genes (Gold 2014 supra) (FIG. 1E). Having established the presence of MR1T clone-activating ligands associated with hpMR1, we examined the reactivity of MR1Ts in whole PBMC using the tetraSPOT assay and found that MR1T responses were observed in each of the 15 donors tested (FIG. 1F). While the hpMR1+EC and hpMR1+MS tetramers elicited comparable responses among the MR1T clones (FIG. 1E), activation in PBMC was significantly higher in response to hpMR1+EC compared to hpMR1+MS for every donor tested (FIG. 1F). Overall, the frequency of tetramer+ cells was correlated with the IFN-\u03b3 response (FIG. 1G). The differential responses seen between the MR1T clones and directly ex-vivo supports the hypothesis that MR1Ts can discriminate between ligands, which would require diverse TCR usage and the ability of MR1 to present more than one ligand.",
                                "The presence and relative abundance of known MR1T ligands was assessed. At present four riboflavin secondary metabolites (5-OP-RU, 5-OE-RU, 7-hydroxy-6-methyl-8-D-ribityllumazine (RL-6-Me-7-OH), and reduced 6-hydroxymethyl-8-D-ribityllumazine (rRL-6-CH2OH)), and the riboflavin biosynthetic precursor 6,7-dimethyl-8-D-ribityllumazine (RL-6,7-diMe) have been identified as activating MR1T ligands. Three of these ligands (5-OP-RU, rRL-6-CH2OH, and RL-6-Me-7-OH) were eluted and identified in hpMR1+EC and +MS but not hpMR1-bac by tandem mass spectrometry (FIGS. 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7E, 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E), although rRL-6-CH2OH and 5-OP-RU cannot be distinguished because they have identical chemical formulas and fragment spectra. The 5-OE-RU and RL-6,7-diMe ligands (FIGS. 9A, 9B, 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D) were not found in these hpMR1 preparations. Using extracted ion chromatogram area underneath the curve (AUC) analysis, we found that the rRL-6-CH2OH/5-OP-RU and RL-6-Me-7-OH were 3.0- and 2.8-fold lower, respectively, in hpMR1+MS as compared to hpMR1+EC (FIGS. 11A, 11B). These data demonstrate that despite similar activation of MR1T cell clones, there are relative quantitative differences between E. coli and M. smegmatis in the loading of hpMR1 canonical bacterial ligands.",
                                "To further explore the MR1 ligandome, all ligands eluted from hpMR1-bac, +EC, and +MS were evaluated using LCMS. Fold increase was calculated for each ion/ligand in either hpMR1+MS or +EC compared to all other samples and plotted on volcano plots (FIG. 2A). As a background control we collected data on the non-MR1 class I MHC molecule T22, which does not present antigen (Adams E J et al, Science 308 227-231 (2005); Wang M et al, Nat Biotechnol 34 828-837 (2016); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). A total of 970 ions were observed above the T22 background intensity in hpMR1-bac, +EC, or +MS preparations and were considered putative MR1 ligands. Of these, 127 ions were observed at >10-fold increased intensity in hpMR1+EC or +MS compared to hpMR1-bac and were considered putative microbial-derived ligands. Twelve bacteria-derived monoisotopic ions were distinct to hpMR1+MS, and 29 bacteria-derived monoisotopic ions were distinct to hpMR1+EC (FIG. 2B). These data demonstrate that disparate bacterial species produce distinct ligands for MR1.",
                                "Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) was used to assist in the identification of these novel ligands. Key to this GNPS analysis is that compounds with similar MS2 fragment spectra and molecular structures form clusters. In all, 154 clusters with anywhere from 2 to 48 nodes per cluster (FIG. 3A) were identified, with 1069 ions that could not be clustered. Remarkably, no ions clustered with rRL-6-CH2OH/5-OP-RU (FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C), and RL-6-Me-7-OH clustered with only one other ion which we identified as acetylated RL-6-Me-7-OH (FIGS. 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D). One large cluster contained two of the most distinct ions for hpMR1+MS (FIG. 3B). Database spectral matching identified riboflavin and several riboflavin adducts or derivatives as constituents of this cluster (FIG. 3C, FIGS. 14A, 14B, 14C, 14D, 14E, 14F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 15D, 15E, 16A, 16B, 16C, 16D, 16E, 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D, 17E).",
                                "Using mass accurate database searches and comparing fragment spectra, three additional novel MR1 ligands were identified in this cluster. The most prevalent hpMR1+MS-specific ion in the cluster was identified as 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) (Bashiri A M et al, PLoS One 5, e15803 (2010); incorporated by reference herein) (FIG. 3C, FIGS. 18A, 18B, 18C, 18D). FO is the precursor to coenzyme F420, an essential component of methanogenesis. The coenzyme F420 biosynthesis pathway is limited to soil-based bacteria such as archaea and some actinobacteria, including mycobacteria, and is rare among normal microbial flora (Selengut J D and Haft D H, J Bacteriol 192, 5788-5798 (2010); incorporated by reference herein) FO is generated when 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate from the tyrosine biosynthesis pathway and 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway react, catalyzed by the FO synthase enzyme. An ion nearby FO in the riboflavin cluster and present in both hpMR1+EC and +MS was identified as 6-(1H-indol-3-yl)-7-hydroxy-8-ribityllumazine, or photolumazine III (PLIII) (Suzuki A et al, Bull Chem Soc Japan 44, 1869-1872 (1971); incorporated by reference herein) (FIG. 3C, FIG. 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D, 19E). Interestingly, another ion unique to hpMR1+MS had similar fragments and neutral loss ions as PLIII and RL-6-Me-7-OH but did not cluster with riboflavin. This ion was identified as 6-(2-carboxyethyl)-7-hydroxy-8-ribityllumazine, or photolumazine I (PLI) (FIG. 3D, FIG. 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D). To confirm the identification of these ligands, riboflavin was obtained and from that was synthesized FO, PLI, and PLIII (FIGS. 14A, 14B, 14C, 14D, 14E, 14F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 15D, 15E, 16A, 16B, 16C, 16D, 16E, 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D, 17E). All confirmed and proposed structures are summarized in Table S3 and FIG. 22.",
                                "To determine whether riboflavin, FO, PLI, and PLIII were antigens, they were tested for their ability to stimulate MR1T clones. Neither riboflavin nor FO was capable of MR1T cell activation. (FIGS. 4A, 4B). The ligand 6-FP antagonizes MR1T activation (Harriff M J et al, PLoS Pathog 12, e1005524 (2016); Eckle S B et al, J Exp Med 211, 1585-1600 (2014); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). To determine whether riboflavin or FO are also antagonistic, antigen presenting cells (APC) were pre-loaded with riboflavin or FO and then tested for their ability to present antigens from M. smegmatis supernatant (Msm-sup) to MR1Ts. Pre-incubation of APC with both riboflavin and FO blocked the MR1T clone response to Msm-sup, and less FO was required to reach 50% inhibition (FIGS. 4A, 4B) suggesting that FO is a more potent antagonist of MR1T activation than riboflavin. In contrast, PLI and PLIII were found to be antigenic. PLI and PLIII were each tested for their ability to stimulate two MR1T clones with distinct TCRs. For MR1T clone D481_C7, PLI and PLIII were potent activating ligands similar to RL-6,7-diMe (FIG. 4C, top). In contrast, there were only modest responses to PLI and PLIII for the D426_G11 clone (FIG. 4C, bottom).",
                                "Given the striking differences in response between D481_C7 and D426_G11, we postulated that discrete TCR usage could be associated with ligand discrimination. To test this, an expanded panel of TCR diverse MR1T clones was tested for their ability to recognize each antigen. Every clone responded robustly to APC infected with M. smegmatis (FIG. 4D). However, striking differences were observed in the response to the various ligands. For example, while the D481_F12 and D481_A9 MR1T cell clones responded to RL-6,7-diMe, they had modest or no recognition of RL-6-Me-7-OH, PLI, and PLIII. In contrast, the D481_C7 responded to RL-6-Me-7-OH as well as RL-6,7-diMe, PLI, and PLIII. Because TRAV1-2 negative cells were stained with the hpMR1+EC tetramer, we also tested the ability of a recently described TRAV12-2 MR1T cell clone to respond to these ligands. The D462_E4 TRAV12-2 MR1T cell clone had comparable responses to RL-6-Me-7-OH and PLI that were greater than PLIII (FIG. 4D). The TRAV12-2 MR1T cell clone did not respond to RL-6,7-diMe as previously reported. Together, these data demonstrate that discrete MR1T TCRs can distinguish between distinct MR1 antigens.",
                                "Within the immune system, T cells respond to perturbations in the intracellular environment. Broadly speaking, conventional MHC-I and MHC-II sample the peptidome, through the processing and presentation of protein antigens, and CD1 samples the microbial cell wall through the processing and presentation of lipids and glycolipids. While MR1 initially was thought to present only riboflavin metabolites, a small portion of the microbial metabolome, this report argues for greater antigen diversity for MR1 and a broader sampling of the microbial metabolome. In classical MHC and CD1, specific recognition of the microbial ligand is conferred by selective TCR usage. Early work proposed that MR1Ts use a semi-invariant TCR to sense riboflavin metabolites presented by MR1. However, more recent work has observed greater diversity in the gene usage of TRAV1\u22122 MR1T TCRs as well as populations of TRAV1-2\u2212 MR1Ts that are recognized by the 5-OP-RU and 6-FP MR1 tetramers and also recognize infection with S. pyogenes, a pathogen that cannot synthesize riboflavin. While we have focused on E. coli and M. smegmatis in this report, we would predict that the selective TCR usage associated with microbes such as C. albicans or S. pyogenes will in turn be associated with MR1 ligands unique to these microbes. We note that the MR1/5-OP-RU tetramer stains all of the diverse TCR clones used in this report, and hence does not serve to define the ligand specificity of these clones. This contrasts with MHCI/II tetramers, but offers parallels to what has been observed using \u03b1GalCer CD1d tetramers, which mask underlying ligand discrimination. Defining how MR1Ts distinguish these distinct small molecules requires structural analysis. One implication of these findings is that the selective expansion or maintenance of MR1T cells with microbial selectivity could be harnessed in immunotherapeutic or vaccination strategies. In this regard, it is not yet known whether MR1T cells have immunologic memory, defined by expansion and retention of antigen-selective T cells.",
                                "Disclosed herein is work reflecting the diversity of ligands bound by MR1 in the context of infection with different microbes. MR1 ligand diversity is detected by MR1T cells, as MR1 tetramers loaded with multiple bacterial ligands were broadly recognized by MR1T clones with distinct TCR arrangements and by PBMC from a panel of donors. Mass spectrometric analysis of microbially-derived MR1 ligands revealed diversity and GNPS analysis resulted in the identification of both shared and unique as well as previously unknown ligands. Testing of riboflavin, FO, PLI and PLIII confirmed these molecules as novel MR1 ligands and revealed selective recognition of these ligands by MR1Ts with distinct TCRs. While previous work has only identified a few riboflavin metabolites as activating MR1Ts, our results establishes that MR1 samples the broader microbial metabolome similar to how conventional MHC molecules sample the microbial peptidome and CD1 molecules sample microbial lipids and glycolipids.",
                                "Specific recognition of and discrimination among the broad array of peptides presented by conventional MHCs and of lipids presented by CD1 requires diverse TCR gene usage, which MR1Ts were originally thought to lack. However, recent work has observed greater diversity in MR1T TCRs, which could provide the diversity for broad MR1 ligand recognition and discrimination required. Indeed, greater diversity in MR1T gene usage was recently observed in TRAV1-2+ MR1T TCRs, and populations of TRAV1-2\u2212 T cells that are recognized by MR1 tetramers and respond to infection with S. pyogenes, a pathogen that cannot synthesize riboflavin, have been discovered. Worth noting is that the MR1/5-OP-RU tetramer stains all of the diverse TCR clones used in this report and hence does not serve to define the ligand specificity of these clones. Reliance solely on this reagent for identification of MAIT cells could mask underlying ligand discrimination similar to observations using CD1d/\u03b1GalCer tetramers.",
                                "These results provoke many exciting avenues to further explore MR1T function and ligand recognition. Since this work found MR1 ligands that are unique to E. coli and M. smegmatis and found MR1T discrimination between those ligands, one can predict that the selective TCR usage associated with microbes such as C. albicans or S. pyogenes indicates the existence of MR1 ligands that are unique to these microbes. One unexpected result was the observation that both E. coli and mycobacteria generate inhibitory and activating MR1 ligands. The ability of bacteria to generate inhibitory MR1 ligands suggests that MR1T recognition may reflect a balance between these competing ligands. The disclosed results also raise the question of the molecular basis for the selective ligand recognition observed here. The selective expansion or maintenance of MR1T cells with microbial selectivity could be harnessed in immunotherapeutic or vaccination strategies.",
