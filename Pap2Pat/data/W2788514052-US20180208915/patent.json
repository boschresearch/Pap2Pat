                        "Glycoproteins widely reside in tissue in animals and plants, the cell membrane and wall of eucaryotic microorganisms, and the like. Recently, it has been becoming clear that sugar chains of glycoproteins play important roles in mechanisms such as differentiation of cells, canceration, and cell-cell recognition and studies are underway on the correlation between the structure and the function of sugar chains to elucidate these mechanisms. In culture cell lines, a glycoprotein is translated as a protein consisting of a uniform amino acid sequence and then glycosylated by posttranslational modification to be delivered into the culture medium. Since this posttranslational modification is not determined uniquely according to its amino acid sequence, sugar chains that are added vary in their structures even on the same protein expressed in the same culture system.",
                        "Antibodies are glycoprotein molecules having N-linked sugar chains (N297-linked sugar chains) linked to the Asn side chains at position 297 located in the Fc regions of the heavy chain molecules. Antibodies are important molecules in basic studies and in the field of medicine and are eagerly studied and developed particularly as antibody medicines. As such, various effects of sugar chains are becoming clear (Non Patent Literature 1: J. N. Arnold, et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol, 2007, 25, 21050). Currently, the therapeutic antibodies that are used are mainly of the IgG class of molecules. Such antibodies are produced by cultured animal cells such as by CHO cells and NS0 cells in general and N297-linked sugar chains of antibodies produced by these animal cells are biantennary complex-type sugar chains, which are heterogeneous in the core fucose, the terminal sialyl and galactosyl groups, and bisecting GlcNAc (Non Patent Literature 2: R. Jefferis, Biotechnol. Prog., 2005, 21-11-6). It has been revealed that N297-linked sugar chains of antibodies have a large influence on effector activities including ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) and CDC (Non Patent Literature 3: Nimmerjahn, Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008, 8, 34-47; Non Patent Literature 4: Jefferis Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery, 2009, 8, 226-234) and the possibility that they also have an influence on half-life in blood has been reported (Non Patent Literature 5: D. Bumbaca, AAPSJ, 2012, 14, 3). Moreover, it has been revealed that antibodies 2,6-sialylated at the nonreducing terminals of the N297-linked sugar chains are active pharmaceutical ingredients in the IVIG (Non Patent Literature 6: Wang, ACS Chem. Biol. 2012, 7, 110-122). Moreover, it is considered that the heterogeneity of N297-linked sugar chains in therapeutic molecules including IgG and Fc fragments has a large influence on their nature and quality as an active ingredient and there is an undeniable possibility that contamination with a small amount of heterogeneously glycosylated molecules significantly changes the properties of end-products.",
                        "In response to this current situation, techniques for making sugar chains homogenous in the production of glycoprotein molecules including therapeutic antibodies and antibody Fc regions are being developed. Known methods for making sugar chains to be added to a glycoprotein homogenous include the transglycosidation reaction using enzymes (Non Patent Literature 6: Wang, ACS Chem. Biol. 2012, 7, 110-122; Non Patent Literature 7: Wang, Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2011, 23, 33-52). This is a multi-stage process consisting of cleavage (hydrolysis reaction) of sugar chains and condensation of sugar chains (transglycosylation reaction) in an in vitro environment. In particular, for the purpose of converting N-type sugar chains, a group of enzymes referred to as endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidases are used. Such enzymes are required 1) to have an ability to hydrolyze complex-type sugar chains specifically as their substrates and 2) to have an ability to catalyze the transglycosylation reaction of a particular structure, as their properties. Endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidases are isolated from various species and different wild type and mutant enzymes are used depending on the kind of sugar chains to be modified as substrates. EndoA (enzyme derived from Arthrobacter protophormiae) (Non Patent Literature 8: Takegawa, Biochem Int. 1991 July; 24(5): 849-55), EndoD (enzyme derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae) (Non Patent Literature 9: Fan, J Biol Chem. 2012 Mar. 30; 287(14): 11272-81), EndoM (enzyme derived from Mucor hiemalis) (Non Patent Literature 10: Umekawa, Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Aug. 30, 203(1): 244-52), EndoH (Non Patent Literature 11: Robbins, J Biol Chem. 1984 Jun. 25; 259(12): 7577-83), EndoF2 (enzyme derived from Flavobacterium Meningosepticum) (Non Patent Literature 12: Huang, Chembiochem. 2011 Apr. 11; 12(6): 932-941), EndoE (enzyme derived from Enterococcus faecalis) (Non Patent Literature 13: Collin, JBC 2004, 279-21), EndoS (enzyme derived from Streptococcus pygenes) (Non Patent Literature 14: Collin, EMBO J. 2001 Jun 15; 20(12): 3046-55), and the like are used for the purpose of making sugar chains homogenous, but only EndoS is confirmed to be an enzyme having both hydrolysis activity and transglycosylation activity on a substrate which is complex-type N297-linked sugar chains having core fucose (Non Patent Literature 15: Allhorn, BMC Microbiol. 2008, 8, 3.; Non Patent Literature 16: Goodfellow, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 8030-8033).",
                        "Further known concerning EndoS is that the hydrolysis activity of EndoS D233Q (in which there is a mutation that substitutes Asp at position 233, the nucleophilic catalytic residue among the 2 catalytic residues (which are Asp at position 233 and Glu at position 235) with Gln) is suppressed to some extent. This mutant is known to catalyze the transglycosylation reaction selectively under conditions in which the reaction system contains a lot of intermediates having sugar chains with oxazolinated reducing terminals (Non Patent Literature 17: Huang, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 12308-12318; Patent Literature 1: WO 2013/120066 A1; Non Patent Literature 18: B. Trastoy et al., PNAS (2014) vol 111, No.18, pp6714-6719). Moreover, many sequences of enzymes classified as being EndoS enzymes that are sequences derived from different serotypes of different strains in the species pyogenes have been reported. In particular, EndoS2 derived from the serotype M49 (Non Patent Literature 19: Sjogren, Biochem J. 2013 Oct 1; 455(1): 107-18; which may also be referred to as EndoS49) has been reported to have similar substrate properties.",
                        "However, the activity of these known EndoS enzymes and mutant enzymes such as EndoS D233Q is not sufficient to perform sugar remodeling of therapeutic antibodies on an industrial scale and a technical improvement that makes effective sugar remodeling possible is required."

                                "From a study using the known EndoS D233Q, it was found that since this mutant maintains a certain hydrolysis activity, its transglycosylation rate in the transglycosylation reaction decreases over time after the onset of the reaction. Therefore, it is difficult to acquire an antibody having homogenous sugar chains at high purity by sugar remodeling with EndoS or existing mutants. In particular, in reactions at a large scale, a final-stage antibody separated from the enzyme inevitably contains the antibody with truncated sugar chains since the purification step takes a long time.",

Based on the 3D structure information (PDB ID:4NUY) of EndoS, the catalytic domain of EndoS was divided into 3 groups of sites: sites predicted to be involved in the recognition of sugar chains, sites in the vicinity of the active center, and sites predicted to be involved in the recognition of antibodies. Mutations were introduced to the sites. The 6 residues H122, Y348, E350, Y402, D405 and R406 were selected as the sites predicted to be involved in the recognition of sugar chains and enzymes were designed such that the interaction formed by the amino acid residues described above should be cut or such that amino acid residues having a large side chain among the selected amino acids should be substituted with amino acid residues having a small side chain in order to make turnover of coupling and dissociation of the sugar chain efficient. P184, D279, and Q303 were selected as sites in the vicinity of the active center and mutations were designed to substitute them with a wide variety of amino acids including those having properties similar to the wildtype amino acid residue or those having properties different from the wildtype amino acid residue. Y282 is selected as one of the sites predicted to be involved in the recognition of antibodies and a mutation was designed to substitute the amino acid residue with a basic amino acid in order to strengthen the interaction with the minus charge near Asn 297 to which sugar chains of antibodies link.
