Through the joint action of heat energy and catalyst, the heavy oil is converted to cracking gas, gasoline and diesel oil, and then the olefins are converted into LPG by-products through adsorption desulfurization in S-zorb unit. S-zorb unit has low antiknock index loss, good octane number retention, low hydrogen consumption, low energy consumption, high yield of light oil and by-products rich in olefins. Therefore, the study of octane number loss in S-zorb unit catalytic cracking technology is conducive to achieve better cleaning and efficiency maximization of finished products, which is also one of the problems with important application value in chemical industry.",

The main adsorbent active substances of S-zrob unit are nickel and zinc oxide. In the process of adsorbent reaction, the increase of sulfur and carbon retention rate of raw and regenerated adsorbents is beneficial to reduce the octane number loss of the product, and also affects the desulfurization rate; Zou et al. (The influence of Zn2SiO4 in S-zorb adsorbent on the octane number of gasoline and desulfurization capacity of adsorbent, Journal of petroleum processing, 2020) have studied that the loss of octane number can be reduced by increasing the mass fraction of zinc silicate phase in the adsorbent. At the same time, the increase of the outer surface of the adsorbent will also lead to the weakening of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for olefins, reducing the ratio of olefin saturation hydrogenation, thus reducing the loss of octane number."

                                "At present, in the application of S-zorb unit, the temperature, pressure and feed of the unit are usually regulated to achieve the optimal desulfurization rate and octane number retention. Firstly, the reaction temperature is an important aspect of the application of S-zorb device. Olefin hydrogenation saturation is a strong exothermic reaction, and the increase of reaction temperature will inhibit this reaction, so as to improve the octane number retention. Ma et al. (Optimization operation, technology application and research for reducing octane number loss of gasoline in S-zorb unit, 2020) have studied that the octane number retention of product increases first and then decreases with the increase of temperature, and the critical point is about 427\u00b0 C. Secondly, reaction pressure is also an important aspect of regulation. Olefin hydrogenation saturation is a volume reduction reaction. The increase of reaction pressure will accelerate the reaction and increase the loss of octane number, but at the same time, the sulfur content of refined gasoline will decrease. To adjust the pressure at different points, it is necessary to find a balance between sulfur content and octane number content. In 2019, the set pressure of S-zorb unit system will be adjusted from 2.5 MPa to 2.45 Mpa, and the differential pressure of filter ME101 will rise to 11 kpa. Finally, in the aspect of feed, hydrogen oil ratio and mass space velocity affect the utility of the unit. Zhou et al. (Analysis and measures for the cause of large octane number loss in S-zorb unit, Yunnan chemical industry, 2019) pointed out that the hydrogen oil ratio, that is, the ratio of gasoline feed to circulating hydrogen, is adopted in S-zorb unit with a molar ratio. Under the condition of constant system pressure, the increase of hydrogen oil ratio will increase the rate of olefin hydrogenation saturation reaction, resulting in octane number loss, but at the same time it can also inhibit the adsorption of adsorbent; The increase of mass space velocity, which is the ratio of gasoline feed to gasoline storage, will inhibit the olefin hydrogenation saturation reaction and reduce the octane number loss, but also reduce the desulfurization rate. Therefore, in terms of feed, it needs to be adjusted accurately to achieve the balance of desulfurization and octane number retention.",
                                "To sum up, at present, the process modeling of catalytic cracking technology mainly relies on the existing chemical mechanism to select specific variables to build the model. Because the model based on the chemical mechanism has higher requirements for raw materials, amounts of unit operating points, complex reaction mechanism and nonlinear relationship between variables, the mathematical model based on the chemical principle cannot fully consider the process modeling. Because of the influence of operating point data, raw material data and catalyst data on the octane number loss of final product, the large octane number loss of product often occurs in the application of S-zorb catalytic cracking technology. Therefore, it is necessary to further model the catalytic cracking process of S-zorb unit and obtain the method to determine the catalytic cracking process of S-zorb unit, it provides technical support for the popularization and application of catalytic cracking technology in S-zorb unit."
