The most common applications of nanowires are expected to be in electromagnetic and energy storage devices.",

No. 6,720,006, teaches a body care product is a product that is brought into contact with human and/or animal skin or mucosa to provide a cleaning, protective, therapeutic, cosmetic or soothing benefit. These products can also be found on surfaces contacting the skin such as diapers, incontinence articles, catamenial devices, training pants, panty liners, etc.; or skin care compositions such as emulsions, lotions, creams, ointments, salves, powders, suspensions, gels, soaps, etc."

                        "In response to the growing threat of AIDS transmission, the use of condoms during sexual intercourse has been suggested as a means of preventing transmission of the AIDS virus. Improper use of condoms, or their perforation during intercourse, renders them only partially effective. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for a better method of inhibiting the transmission of the AIDS virus in humans during sexual intercourse and during surgical procedures on infected patients. The present invention provides compositions and methods for making and using an anti-viral composition for use in treating and preventing viral infection.",
                        "The present invention includes compositions, methods of making and methods of using silver nanoparticles. More particularly, it includes the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (particles of sizes between 1 and 100 nm) and nanowires (1-D structures with diameters between 1 and 100 nm with lengths up to several hundreds of nanometers) using glycerin as both the reducing agent and the solvent of the nanostructures. However, this technique may be extended but not limited to nanoparticles and nanowires of gold, platinum, palladium, copper, iron, and alloys composed of these metals. It can be also extended to metal oxides nanoparticles and nanowires such as titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, etc. It is important to mention that the method can be also expanded to the production of particles in the mesoscopic range, specifically from 100 to 500 nm. Several capping agents can be used, e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).",
                        "A current problem is the resistance developed by bacteria to current antibiotics. In addition, there are no 100% efficient treatments and vaccines to prevent or combat diseases due to viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), etc. Due to its strong toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms, silver has been used against bacteria and fungi. There is a possibility of using nanotechnology to improve and develop silver nanoparticles to use as a biocide in substitution of current products like antibiotics. In fact, it is disclosed herein that the properties of silver nanoparticles in different forms are able to deactivate HIV with concentrations below the cytotoxic concentrations for MT2 cells.",
                        "The chemical and physical properties that bulk materials exhibit change drastically when the material is in the nanometer range. For this reason there is an increasing appeal in the development of nanomaterials, which can be used in physical, biological, biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.",
                        "The fact that glycerin is the solvent for the nanoparticles and/or nanowires allows these structures to be used in almost any current commercial application of glycerin, such as preservation of fruit, prevention of freezing in hydraulic jacks, lubrication for molds, some printing inks, cake and candy making, and as an antiseptic. The present technology offers the possibility of combining the biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles with the versatile properties of glycerin in body care products. However, the present invention is not limited to body care products. Glycerin is miscible with water so other applications, such as paints, plastics and other composite materials can be implemented.",
                        "The present invention includes the synthesis and characterization of silver nanowires synthesized by the polyol method. In an alternative method, ethyleneglycol (EG) may be used as both reducing reagent and solvent. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) plays a role of structure-directing agent or capping agent. Nanowires were also synthesized by a modified polyol method using glycerin (G) instead of EG and poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDAM) replacing PVP."

Noble metal nanoparticles and nanowires produce spectacular changes in the color, i.e., the light scattering by surface plasmons. In the case of transition metals the search for ultra dense magnetic recording devices has promoted the research in nanoparticles and nanowires. Finite size can have effects on the structural and magnetic order in nanoparticles and nanowires. It has been found that the present invention may be used alone or in a medium or carrier, where the silver nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed, and is very friendly to the human body and can be rapidly incorporated to a variety of body care products to exploit the biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against a wide range of toxic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and fungi).",
                        "One important characteristic of the present invention is the use of glycerin as both the solvent and the reducing agent in the production of silver nanoparticles. Using glycerin and equivalent compounds as the solvent and reducing agent allows noble metal nanoparticles and nanowires, e.g., silver nanoparticles, to be dispersed well in a solvent that is extensively used in many applications, so the biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles can be exploited in many of those products. A well-established method found in the literature for the synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and nanowires is known as the polyol method. In this technique, ethylene glycol is used as both the reducing agent and the solvent. The main difference in the proposed technology is the replacement of ethylene glycol by glycerin (propylene glycol) which is a friendlier and less toxic compound. The physical properties of both compounds are different, so the general behavior of the final product will be different.",

The observation that other capping agents may be used, opens the possibility to expand the type of compounds that are used as capping agents, so more specific properties may arise.",

The setup used for this study included a three neck flask with condenser system heated in oil bath. 10 ml of ethyleneglyco (EG) or glycerin (G) with 5 ml of an EG or G solution of 0.375 M PVP or PDDAM were refluxed at 160\u00b0 C. for 2 h, then 5 ml of an EG or G solution of 0.25 M silver nitrate were added drop wise in not less than five minutes. The color of the solution changes significantly in the study. When the first drops of silver nitrate are added, the mixture turns yellow immediately. With the addition continuing, the solution becomes opaque gradually. After all the silver nitrate solution is added, the solution turned turbid with a grey color in about 15 min, indicating the appearance of Ag nanowires; the reaction continued at 160\u00b0 C. for 30 min. When the reaction has finished, centrifugation is needed to remove nanoparticles and other impurities from the nanowires. The grey precipitate remained and needed no further purification.",
                        "Initial characterization of nanowires. The samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The product from the reaction is always a combination of nanoparticles and nanowires. An interesting difference between PVP and PDDAM is that the nanoparticles generated by the use of the later are very sensitive to the irradiation produced by the electron beam. When PVP is used, the nanoparticles have polyhedral and cubic shapes while in the case of PDDAM only cubes are formed. In the case of the nanowires, they have a five-fold symmetry. They have an average diameter of around 70 nm and lengths up to several microns. It is important to mention that the aspect ratio and the production rate of the nanowires can be controlled to some extent modifying the reactions conditions. X-Ray diffraction of two typical samples showed that when PVP is used with either EG or G, only pure silver compounds are synthesized (nanoparticles and nanowires). In the case of PDDAM (FIG. 2b) two different phases are present: silver and silver chloride. This is consistent with the fact that the nanoparticles formed using PDDAM as capping agent are very sensitive to the electron beam, while the nanowires remain intact. Further TEM analysis may be conducted for the PDDAM systems the nanoparticles are mainly AgCl and the nanowires are only Ag.",

EDS analysis on different samples showed that they are composed only of Ag and have a very thin amorphous layer of capping agent (PVP or PDDAM). Further analysis to fully understand the growth mechanism and the role that the defects play on it is in progress. However, it is expected that these type of nanowires will have mechanical properties that strongly deviate from the bulk material.",

Only addition rates lower than 0.5 mL of\n  AgNO3/min can produce high aspect ratio nanowires.\n- c) In PDDAM+glycerin system, the molar ratio of capping agent could be\n  reduced from 3:2 (PVP:Ag) to 1:4 (PDDAM:Ag). However, because of the\n  chlorine present in PDDAM, AgCl nanoparticles are also produced.\n- d) At the same reaction conditions and a molar ratio of PVP:Ag of 6:1,\n  glycerin produces more nanowires than ethylene glycol.\n- e) When glycerin is used instead of ethylene glycol, PDDAM produces\n  more nanowires than PVP.\n- f) In the case of PVP, the nanowires can be separated from the\n  nanoparticles by centrifugation using acetone to dilute the sample,\n  while for PDDAM is not possible to separate the nanowires from the\n  nanoparticles by this procedure.",
                        "As opposed to the most extensively used synthesis method (known as the polyol method) which uses ethylene glycol as the solvent and reducing agent, the glycerin method disclosed herein eliminates the problem of finding an agent which will facilitate the contact of the silver nanoparticles with the body. The reason is because glycerin is a lot friendlier with the human body than ethylene glycol. That is why glycerin, in contrast to ethylene glycol, plays an important role in a vast range of body care products. Use of well-known and characterized compounds that are biocompatible and non-allergenic is especially important because of the possibility to generate products to prevent the infection against, e.g., HIV.",

In recent years, inorganic nanostructures have attracted growing interest due to their potential applications in catalysis1, biological sensors2, and nanoelectronics3 among others. As these materials have at least one of their dimensions between 1 nm and 100 nm, interesting properties arise due to phenomena such as quantum confinement and high surface-to-volume ratio4.",
                        "In the case of noble-metal nanomaterials, the physicochemical properties are highly influenced by shape and size1,5. For example, it is well known that the optical absorption spectra of metal nanoparticles are dominated by surface plasmon resonances (SPR)6, being the case of gold and silver unique. Both have the proper density of free electrons for their nanoparticles to possess SPR peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum7, which in addition to their large effective scattering cross section, makes them ideal candidates for molecular labeling8. Recently, the absorption spectra of individual silver nanoparticles was correlated with their size and shape determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)9. The results indicate that spherical and roughly spherical nanoparticles absorb in the blue region of the spectrum, while decahedral nanoparticles and particles with triangular cross sections absorb in the green and red part of the spectrum, respectively. For each different morphology, the SPR peak wavelength increases with size. Thus, an exquisite control of size, composition and morphology is highly desirable. Additionally, we recently found that the size of silver nanoparticles is important in other applications by demonstrating that silver nanoparticles undergo a size-dependent interaction with HIV-1, with nanoparticles exclusively in the range of 1-10 nm attaching to the virus10. Due to this interaction, silver nanoparticles inhibit the virus from binding to host cells.",
                        "Noble-metal nanocrystals have been synthesized using a variety of methods, being the solution phase techniques probably the most employed ones1. In solution phase synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles the control of shape is a challenging task, since the structure of the original seeds plays a crucial role in the morphology of the final product11. Multiple TEM studies on small (<5 nm) metal particles12-16 have demonstrated that small excitations, even at room temperature, may be sufficient to induce structural fluctuations, and that the rates of such fluctuations increase with the decreasing size of the nanocrystal13. These morphological fluctuations have also been validated by other techniques such as infrared spectroscopy17. Based on these observations and the results of theoretical calculations, it is known that the total potential surface energy for the possible nanoparticle morphologies consists of several minima, and that the barriers between them are low enough (\u02dckT), so that thermal fluctuations provide sufficient energy to produce changes between the different morphologies. At these small sizes, the five fold symmetry twinned structures such as the icosahedron and the decahedron tend to be slightly more stable, while cuboctahedral nanoparticles become more stable at larger sizes12. It is also known that when the size of the nanocrystals increases the structural fluctuations cease, thus fixing the nanoparticle morphology either as single-crystalline or multi-twinned11. On the basis of this model, one can easily understand why in a typical sample of nanoparticles produced by most of the solution phase techniques, a statistical distribution of shapes will be observed. However, significant progress has been achieved in controlling the shape and size of the metal nanostructures, and many applications have been proposed based on their morphology18-21.",
                        "Among solution phase techniques, the polyol method is one of the most employed routes for the synthesis of metal nanostructures. In this method, a metal precursor is dissolved in a liquid polyol, e.g. ethylene glycol, in the presence of capping agent molecules such as poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). By controlling parameters such as the molar ratio between metal precursor and capping agent, order of addition, temperature and reaction time, a reasonable control of size and morphology can be achieved22. In the case of silver, Xia and coworkers demonstrated that by carefully adjusting some of these variables and particularly the molar ratio between silver nitrate and PVP, a range of controlled morphologies such as nanocubes and nanowires can be produced11. They found that if single-crystalline seeds were primarily produced, the final product is composed of monodispersed cubes, tetrahedrons and octahedrons, while if multi-twinned particles (MTPs) with decahedral shape were primarily formed; the final product is mainly composed of nanorods and nanowires with a remarkable multi-twinned structure with pentagonal cross sections. The fact that 1-D structures of silver can be reliably produced in high yields is quite significant, since the synthesis of anisotropic fcc materials is not as simple as for non-cubic crystal structures.",
                        "Additionally, Gao, et al., found that when the molar ratio between PVP and AgNO3 is six to one, only a monolayer of PVP is adsorbed into the surface of the wires23. Therefore, it may be expect that when the nanowires are exposed to air, the polymer membrane will be permeable enough to atmospheric gases and water vapor. Thus, the stability of the nanowires exposed to air against atmospheric corrosion needs to be explored. Furthermore, the higher reactivity of metal nanomaterials compared to their bulk state is also commonly known, so phenomena such as corrosion might be enhanced.",
                        "Atmospheric corrosion in metals is a frequent phenomenon. Unlike other metals, atmospheric corrosion of silver, also known as tarnishing, occurs towards sulfidation and not the formation of silver oxide24. The atmospheric sulfidation of silver has been extensively investigated24-28. It has been demonstrated that silver sulfidizes upon exposure to several gaseous sulfur-containing compounds, being hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) the most important silver corrodents25. Surprisingly, the study of atmospheric corrosion in the type of silver nanostructures described so far is an area that has been largely unexplored. To our knowledge, there is no information about the stability of these nanostructures after they are extracted from the synthesis solution and exposed to air.",

Along with these findings regarding the stability of the PVP-coated silver nanostructures, a new method for the production of core-shell silver-silver sulfide nanoparticles and nanowires is presented.",
                        "Metal nanostructures such as nanoparticles and nanowires have been proposed as building blocks for several applications in nanofabrication and nanoelectronics. However, even when atmospheric corrosion is common in metals, there is a lack of information about the stability of those nanostructures against such phenomenon. Therefore, atmospheric corrosion of silver nanowires and nanoparticles synthesized by the polyol method using poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as capping agent by different techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was determined. After synthesis and purification, the silver nanostructures were deposited on different substrates and exposed to laboratory air at ambient conditions. The structural changes in the samples were monitored by TEM as a function of time for a period of time of twenty four weeks. These results demonstrate that these silver nanostructures are susceptible to atmospheric corrosion and that, in most cases, a thin layer of silver sulfide nanocrystals is formed on their surfaces. The enhanced reactivity of regions with defects and dislocations could explain the observation that the corrosion rate of the nanowires is higher than the corrosion rate of the nanoparticles, since it is well known that the structure of the nanowires synthesized by the polyol method is multi-twinned, while most of the nanoparticles that remained after synthesis are single-crystals. Additionally, part of the original sample of silver nanostructures was sulfidized using hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as corrodent gas. After performing XPS studies of this sample, the presence of PVP on the surface of the sulfidized silver nanostructures was confirmed. This result agrees with the observation that in the atmospherically corroded samples, even when in some cases the original silver nanostructure was completely corroded, the silver sulfide nanocrystals remained together adopting the shape of silver nanostructure. Finally, these results indicate that the corrosion at the nanoscale seems to be similar to that of the bulk silver.",

Compositional analysis performed under the TEM by acquiring EDS spectra of several nanowires, revealed that the body is only composed of silver, while the presence of PVP in the surface of the nanowires is responsible for the appearance of the characteristic carbon, nitrogen and oxygen peaks (FIG. 1d). X-ray diffraction of the synthesized nanowires (FIG. 1c) showed just a single crystalline phase that could be indexed as fcc silver (JCPDS File 08-0720). As a direct result of the 1-D structure of the nanowires, the ratio between the relative intensities of the {111} and {100} planes is higher than the expected for bulk silver (\u02dc4.6 vs. \u02dc2.2), indicating the relative abundance of {111 } planes.",

Their tips resemble a decahedral nanoparticle and exhibit a pentagonal cross-section all across their long axis (FIG. 1b). Based on that, it has been proposed that these nanowires evolve from a multi-twinned decahedral nanoparticle growing in the [110] direction with the capping agent guiding the structure by stabilizing more effectively the newly formed {100 } facets than the {111 }29. In a different report, Sun et. al. found that small gold nanoparticles functionalized with dithiol linkages preferentially attached to the ends of the nanowires (i.e. the {111 } facets), which demonstrates again that PVP interacts more strongly with the {100} facets in the main body of the wire30.",

Once the products are formed, it provides stability by protecting the surface of the nanocrystals. Additionally, the capping agent can modify the interactions of the metal nanostructure with external systems. In fact, the physicochemical properties of nanostructures are strongly dependent upon their interactions with capping agent molecules3. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between the capping agent and the surface of the nanowires.",

                        "All the binding energies are referenced to C 1s (284.5 eV). PVP is a linear polymer that has a polyvinyl skeleton with polar groups forming a pyrrolidone ring. Based on that, three carbon species with different chemical environments can be identified. For the purposes of our analysis, we labeled them as 1, 2 and 3 (FIG. 2a). In the case of pure PVP, the spectrum obtained for C 1s can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 284.8, 285.7 and 287.8 eV, while the N 1s and O 1s spectra exhibited single peaks at 399.9 and 531.8 eV, respectively (FIG. 2). The fitted C 1s peaks can be explained in terms of the electronegativity of the substituents of the different carbon atoms that compose the PVP repeating unit. In general, as the electronegativity of the substituent is higher the more it withdraws electron density from the carbon atom, causing an increase in the binding energy of the C 1s electrons. The carbon atom numbered as three is bonded to oxygen, which is the element with the highest electronegativity in the pyrrolidone ring. Therefore, the peak at 287.8 eV can be attributed to the C\u2550O bond, while the 285.7 and 284.8 eV peaks are result of the C\u2014N and C\u2014C bonds, respectively.",
                        "By analyzing the XPS spectra of the PVP-coated silver nanowires, no significant differences with respect of pure PVP can be observed in the C 1s and N is peaks (FIG. 3). However, the peak of O 1s can be deconvoluted in two peaks with binding energies of 531.9 and 532.9 eV. In addition, the observed peaks for silver resulting from the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 electrons have binding energies of 367.8 and 373.8 eV, respectively. The 0 is peak at 531.9 eV is similar to the one observed for pure PVP, while the peak with binding energy of 532.6 eV can be attributed to the interaction between the oxygen in the carboxyl group of the PVP chain and the surface of the silver nanowires. It is probable that the interaction with the surface of the nanowire decreases the electron density of the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group, producing the appearance of the peak at 532.6 eV. By analyzing the XPS spectra of PVP-coated silver nanoparticles, Huang et. al. proposed that the adsorption of the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group on the silver nanoparticle surface will induce an image dipole on the particle surface, so the observed binding energies for the 0 is and the Ag 3d5/2 electrons are dominated by the electrostatic interaction between the final silver ions with their environment; producing an upper shift in the case of the O 1s binding energy, and lowering the binding energy of the Ag 3d5/2 electrons with respect of that for bulk silver31. Furthermore, the binding energies for the Ag 3d5/2 and the Ag 3d3/2 electrons are smaller than the binding energies of metal silver (368.2 eV for Ag 3d5/2, and 374.2 eV for Ag 3d3/2) but higher than the binding energies of silver (1) oxide (367.5 eV for Ag 3d3/2, and 373.5 eV for Ag 3d3/2)32. This is also a clear indication of the strong interaction between the oxygen atom of the carboxyl (C\u2550O) groups in the PVP chain and the silver surface of the nanowires.",

Electron microscopy and their related techniques are suitable for this type of analysis mainly because they provide the ability to study in great detail the structural properties and compositional characteristics of many different materials. As mentioned in the experimental section, samples for TEM analysis were prepared just after the product was synthesized and analyzed periodically during an interval of six months.",
                        "FIG. 4 includes electron microscopy images of the same TEM sample of silver nanowires analyzed at different times. FIG. 4a shows the condition of the silver nanowires just after synthesis. As can be observed in the image, the surface of the nanowire is smooth and the presence of a twin boundary in the middle of the nanowire is clear. This twin boundary results from the five-fold symmetry of these type of nanowires. FIG. 4b presents an image of the same sample after three weeks of exposure to ambient air. The surface of the nanowire is rougher than the observed in panel a, and nanoparticles start to appear on the surface and the surroundings of the wires. A higher magnification of the nanoparticles on the surface of the nanowires is shown in FIG. 4c. The crystalline nature of such nanoparticles is evident from the image. In panels d, e and f the same sample after exposure to air for four, five and twenty four weeks respectively, can be observed. Both panels e and f present similar structural changes, where a shell of crystallites is formed around the original silver nanowires. The diameter of the core-shell structure matches the diameter of the original nanowire, i.e. the diameter of the silver nanowire core is decreased.",
                        "The same analysis was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the results are presented in FIG. 5. In FIGS. 5a and 5b images of the sample after four weeks are shown. It can be observed that small protuberances, that resemble the ones presented in FIG. 4d, start to appear. In some cases, after twenty four weeks (FIG. 5c and 5d) the structure of the nanowires can not be clearly discerned. Several nanowires seem to have coalesced and the surfaces are more irregular and rough. Also, some nanowires present fractures along their length. Additionally, at the ends of several nanowires the presence of larger bumps is observed. Clearly, the as-synthesized nanowires are not stable and a notable degradation is observed.",
                        "It is well known that when a highly energetic electron beam passes through a sample, electrons lose energy predominantly through electronic and nuclear interactions with the specimen. These interactions may damage the structure of the sample. The damage caused by electronic interactions is known as radiolytic, while the damage produced by nuclear interactions is known as knock-on damage33. Therefore, to properly study the observed structural changes, it was important to confirm that they were not direct consequence of the irradiation damage produced by the periodical observation in the TEM. For the case of the silver nanowires, the irradiation damage produced in the metal core by the TEM electron beam at 200 kV should be negligible. However, the silver nanostructures analyzed herein were capped by an organic polymer that can be damaged by the exposure to periodical electron irradiation.",
                        "FIG. 6 shows TEM images of samples that were not exposed to periodical electron irradiation. The TEM samples were prepared using product from the same solution batch of the silver nanowires presented in previous figures. FIGS. 6a and 6b present images of two different samples observed after six and twenty four weeks, respectively. Both images show that the degradation results are congruent with the ones presented in the previous discussion, and that a thin layer of crystallites is formed on the surface of the nanowires. Thus, the observed structural changes are not generated by the periodical irradiation of the electron beam. The fact that no significant irradiation damage was observed can be explained by the fact that for a material to experience knock-on displacements a specific energy threshold needs to be surpassed. Below this energy, the electron beam just enhances atom vibrations in the sample and the provided energy is dissipated as phonons. For most metals, the threshold energy is 20-30 eV and, unless long exposures and or high current densities are achieved, knock-on damage does not occur for accelerating voltages less than 300 kV33. In the case of radiolytic damage, the ionization effects decrease significantly as the acceleration voltage of the electron beam increases up to 100 kV and remain low at higher voltages33.",
                        "FIG. 7 presents high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of the nanowire that appeared in FIG. 6b. It is clear that the shell of nanocrystals covers all the surface of the nanowire, having a regular thickness of \u02dc15 nm across the length of the wire. Similarly to some of the previous images, at the tips of the nanowire a low-density region appears between the shell and the core. The bright contrast in the exterior of the shell might be due to the increased thickness because of the cylindrical shape of the shell, while in the low-density region the electron beam could be just traveling across two \u02dc15 nm thick cylindrical walls of the shell, finding a hollow center. Interestingly, the formation of this shell of crystallites is also noticeable in two nanoparticles that remained attached to the original nanowire (Panels a and c). In the case of the nanoparticles, the thickness of the shell is also of \u02dc15 nm. Three regions without the brighter core are also distinguishable. The observed contrast suggest that these are hollow structures only composed by a shell of nanocrystals. It is important to note that all these observations suggest that the PVP coating is still there, promoting that all the nanocrystals that composed the shell remain together adopting the shape of the original silver nanostructure.",
                        "Compositional analysis of three different regions in one of the tips of this nanowire demonstrated the presence of considerable amounts of sulfur (FIG. 8). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy line scans were acquired for two different regions. In this case, the intensity of the profile is proportional to the concentration of the element that is being analyzed. The first line scan is presented in FIGS. 8a and 8b, and corresponds exclusively to the shell of nanocrystals. As observed in FIG. 8b, the intensity profile of sulfur seems to be half of the profile obtained for silver, suggesting that the shell is composed by silver sulfide (Ag2S) crystallites. In the case of the second line scan (FIGS. 8a and 8c), the proportion of silver compared to sulfur is higher. This suggests that the bright core of the nanowire is still pure silver, while just a thin layer of silver sulfide nanocrystals was formed on its surface. Interestingly, the ratio between the silver and the sulfur intensity profiles at both ends of the scan is again close to 2:1. This is congruent with the fact that, at both ends, the line scan corresponds just to the shell. To determine more precisely the atomic ratio between silver and sulfur in different regions of the wire, punctual compositional analyses were acquired operating the electron microscope in EDS mode. The results are presented in FIGS. 8a and 8d. In the case of the shell, the atomic ratio between silver and sulfur is close the stoichiometric of silver sulfide. The measured ratio of the outer part in the shell was of 2.25 while in the low-density region of the shell was of 2.09. For the case of the bright core of the nanowire, the atomic ratio between silver and sulfur was of 29.90, confirming that the core is formed by pure silver surrounded by a shell of silver sulfide nanoparticles.",
                        "Analysis of the Fast Fourier Transform obtained from a high resolution TEM image of the crystallites surrounding the silver nanowires confirmed also the presence of silver sulfide. The analysis of the spots presented in the FFT of FIG. 9b indicated the presence of a single crystalline phase. As presented in Table 2, the interplanar distances and angles between planes measured from the FFT are in good agreement with monoclinic acanthite silver sulfide, which is the most stable polymorph of silver sulfide at room temperature. This agrees with the fact that in previous studies the silver sulfide resulting from the corrosion of silver is primarily crystalline rather than amorphous28.",
                        "It is known that the principal product from the atmospheric corrosion of silver is silver sulfide, and that the corrosion layers do not include carbonates, sulfates or nitrates28. The silver corrosion process is primarily influenced by the type and the amount of reduced-sulfur gases such as H2S, OCS, SO2 and CS2 present in the atmosphere, as well as the amount of water on the silver surface24-28. It has been reported that among the reduced sulfur-containing gases, H2S and OCS are the principal corrodents of silver, since the sulfidation rates of those gases are about one order of magnitude higher than the rates of SO2 and CS225. Even though the typical concentrations of these reduced-sulfur gases in the atmosphere are low, they are sufficient to initiate the corrosion process28.",
                        "In the case of the reaction between silver and hydrogen sulfide, the sulfidation mechanism needs to be completely understood26. It is believed that the general reaction between them occurs according to reaction (1), and that the water present on the silver surface provides the proper medium for the gas to be dissolved for the subsequent reaction with silver. Indeed, extensive research has demonstrated that the silver corrosion increases with increasing relative humidity24-26,28. \n\n2 Ag+H2S\u2192Ag2S+H2 \u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "Also, the presence of other gases, such as O2 and NO2 can enhance the sulfidation process according to the following reactions27: \n\n2 Ag+H2S+/\u00bdO2\u2192Ag2S+H2O \u2003\u2003(2) \n\n2 Ag+H2S+2 NO2\u2192Ag2S+2 HNO2 \u2003\u2003(3)",
                        "When no sources of H2S are available, OCS is the principal corrodent of silver in atmospheric conditions25. As shown in reaction (4), in the presence of water, this gas rapidly decomposes to form hydrogen sulfide. The corrosion produced by OCS is important since it is the most abundant sulfur species in the atmosphere. \n\nOCS+H2O\u2192H2S+CO2 \u2003\u2003(4)",
                        "Another interesting point, as demonstrated by these results, is that when silver is corroded, it does not tend to form uniform films. Silver sulfide is rather grown as a rough, discontinuous series of clumps28. Bennet, et al., found that the silver sulfide clumps formed on the surface of evaporated silver films coalesce slowly into a continuous film24. They reported that in atmospheric air with concentrations of H2S as low as 0.2 parts per billion, a 1.5-3 nm-thick non-uniform tarnish film is formed after one week, and a 6 nm-thick or more after one month. However, the corrosion rate is highly sensitive to other variables such as relative humidity and temperature, so different rates to the ones presented by Bennet can be achieved at different conditions.",
                        "In FIG. 10, images of different regions of the sample shown in FIG. 6b are presented. From the images; it is clear that not only the nanowires are being corroded but also the nanoparticles. Interestingly, not all the nanowires are being corroded in the same manner. As presented in panels e and f, the corrosion of some nanowires is not homogeneous. In these cases certain regions of the nanowires are corroded at higher rates than others. Without creating any limitations, two reasons can contribute to this phenomenon. The first one can be related to a lower localized PVP surface coverage that facilitates the corrosion process, and a second reason can be the existence of regions with higher proportion of defects along the nanowires. As regions with defects are more reactive, the corrosion process might be enhanced by the presence of such defects.",
                        "Indeed, the enhanced reactivity of regions with defects can also explain why the corrosion rate of the nanowires seems to be higher than the nanoparticles. As mentioned earlier in the manuscript, it was found that single-crystalline seeds primarily produced cubic, tetrahedral and octahedral nanoparticles, while multi-twinned seed particles (MTPs) with decahedral shape induce the formation of nanorods and nanowires with a multi-twinned structure with pentagonal cross sections. The basic structure of the decahedral seed particle can be described as the junction of five tetrahedron single crystals with twin-related adjoining faces34-38. The theoretical angle between two (111) planes is \u02dc70.5\u00b0, so by joining five tetrahedra a gap of \u02dc7.5\u00b0 is generated. Thus, the space is not filled and some form of internal strain is necessary, giving place to dislocations and other structural defects38,39. These defects are also observed in transmission electron microscope (TEM) cross-section images of the aforementioned nanowires29,40.The presence of these defects across the length of the nanowires enhances their corrosion compared to the one observed for the single-crystalline nanoparticles, as the case of the nanocube presented in FIG. 10d. In fact, it has been demonstrated that twinned particles are expected to exhibit a stronger reactivity and susceptibility towards etching than single crystalline particles41. In the case of silver tarnishing, it is known that the presence of facets or steps in the silver crystal enhances the sulfidation rate42,43. Nucleation and growth of silver sulfide occur more rapidly along defects and dislocations than on smooth defect-free surfaces44.",
                        "Another important observation arises from the fact that in other cases, even when the nanowires have been completely corroded as in the case of panel b, the silver sulfide nanocrystals remained aligned in a wire-like form. Again, this implies that the PVP layer is still absorbed into the surface of the formed nanocrystals. However, the specific interaction between the atmospherically corroded products and PVP is yet to be determined.",
                        "On the other hand, nanowires that remained in the original solution for weeks were also evaluated by electron microscopy (images not shown here). After twenty four weeks, no corrosion was observed. Compositional analysis demonstrated that they are only composed by silver capped by PVP, and no sulfur was detected. This confirms that the corrosion occurs only when they are exposed to corroding sulfur sources, such as H2S and OCS.",
                        "Sulfidation of silver nanostructures. As described in the experimental section, part of the original synthesized silver nanostructures were sulfidized in a nitrogen atmosphere using a 10 sccm flow of H2S. The results are presented in FIG. 11. Larger crystalline bumps were produced on the surface of the nanowires. In some cases, as seen in FIG. 11d, the nanowire core was decomposed into several crystals presumably attached by the action of the PVP coating. Compositional EDS mapping was performed on one of these nanowires (FIG. 12). It is clear that the sulfur map matches the map obtained for silver, where the differences in intensities correspond to differences in relative concentration. Interestingly, the carbon map also correlates with the map of sulfur and silver. This is an indication that the PVP coating could be still present. As for the nanowires atmospherically corroded, punctual EDS analysis was conducted in the tip of one nanowire (FIG. 13). Two regions with markedly differences in contrast were analyzed and the atomic ratio between silver and sulfur was measured. The ratio between silver and sulfur in the brighter region was 5.47, while the ratio between them in the lighter region was 1.85. The fact that regions with ratios higher than the stoichiometric are detected indicates that those regions were not completely transformed into silver sulfide and that a metallic silver core is present.",
                        "To confirm whether or not the PVP coating remains adsorbed on the surface of the nanostructures after they were synthetically corroded, XPS studies were performed (FIG. 14). The results are shown in Table 3.",
                        "The presence of C, N and O on the surface of the sulfidized nanostructures was confirmed. The values for the binding energies of the three elements were similar to the values obtained for the original silver nanowires, confirming the presence of PVP on the surface of the sulfidized nanowires. Again, the spectrum obtained for C 1s can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 284.9, 285.9 and 288.3 eV, while the N 1s exhibited a single peak at 400.0 eV and the O 1s peak can be deconvoluted in two peaks with binding energies of 531.9 and 532.9 eV. This data suggest that PVP remains adsorbed on the surface of the sulfidized nanowires via the carboxyl group of the pyrrolidone ring. The observed peaks from the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 electrons have binding energies of 368.0 and 374.0 eV, respectively, while the peaks corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 have binding energies of 161.2 and 162.3 eV. These values are consistent with the reported data for silver sulfide32. In addition, the XPS data confirmed that no sulfites or sulfates were present. The binding energy of the O 1s peak also confirms that no silver (I) oxide was formed, since the expected binding energy for the 0 is peak in silver (1) oxide should be of 528.6 eV32, which is significantly lower than the value obtained for the sulfidized nanowires.",
                        "The silver nanostructures produced by the polyol method of the present invention using a six to one molar ratio between PVP and silver nitrate, are susceptible to atmospheric corrosion. In most cases, a thin shell of silver sulfide nanocrystals is formed on their surface. Multi-twinned nanowires are more vulnerable to corrosion compared to the single-crystalline nanoparticles due to their higher proportions of defects. Importantly, the fact that the presented silver nanostructures are being corroded at ambient conditions might limit their use in nanoelectronics and nanofabrication.",
                        "Additionally, it is well known that noble-metal nanostructures exhibit a phenomenon known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by which the scattering cross sections of adsorbed molecules are dramatically enhanced; thus, vibrational spectra for absorbates can be obtained45,46. Because silver, gold and copper have appropriate values of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants47, SERS is usually conducted on roughened substrates of these metals. Alternatively, a powerful technique for the production of noble-metal nanoparticle arrays on different surfaces is the so called nanosphere lithography (NSL), where the resulting substrates are referred as metal film-over-nanosphere (MFON) surfaces48. Based on the fact that silver nanostructures such as the ones presented here are susceptible to atmospheric corrosion, a careful evaluation of the effect that silver sulfide formation could have in SERS should be conducted. On the other hand, cleaning techniques such as hydrogen plasma reduction could help to reduce the formed sulfide to metallic silver. For example, hydrogen plasma was used to reduce silver sulfide on a daguerreotype surface by forming hydrogen sulfide, which was subsequently pumped away from the vacuum system49. However, as for the case of silver sulfide growth rate, many variables such as the size and shape of the silver nanocrystals, the thickness of the sulfide layer and the time of exposure to the hydrogen plasma, among others, may affect the efficiency in the reduction of the sulfide. Thus, systematic studies should be performed on case-to-case basis.",
                        "It was further found that Ag\u2014Ag2S core-shell nanostructures can be produced, as described herein. This type of conductor-semiconductor nanostructures might be of interest for sensing purposes, since it has been shown that silver sulfide thin films with excess of silver can be used as photodetectors in the infrared region50. Since the silver nanostructure acts as a template, the shape and size of the sulfidized nanostructures could be controlled.",
                        "Higher proportions of PVP could be used in the synthesis, therefore increasing the thickness of the polymer layer adsorbed on the surface of the nanostructures. The fact that a thicker layer of PVP is covering the silver surface of the nanostructures might reduce or prevent the corrosion of the metal core that forms the nanoparticle or the nanowire. Finally, silver nanomaterials such as nanoparticles and nanowires can be synthesized by many other colloidal techniques employing different capping agents. Independently of the synthesis method, after the silver nanostructures are exposed to sulfur-containing gas sources it is expected that they will be corroded. As noted previously, it is believed that water plays a fundamental role in the atmospheric corrosion of silver surfaces, so hydrophobic capping agents could improve the performance of these materials against corrosion. Thus, it is necessary to perform similar studies to the one presented here to properly evaluate the stability of the products generated by other synthesis techniques against atmospheric corrosion. In fact, this also applies to nanostructures of other metals that are subject to atmospheric corrosion such as iron and copper among others.",

It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics, or food products. It is a solvent for food colors and flavors. This advantage of glycerin being 100% friendly with the human body presents an advantage against other technologies. For the case of PVP, an extensive study of toxicological data in animals supports the biological inertness of PVP. The acute toxicity is extremely low and long-term administration has demonstrated no adverse effects. As a large molecule, it does not rapidly pass through most body membranes such as skin, or the gut wall. Studies have shown PVP to be essentially non-toxic by oral administration, inhalation and intravenous or other parenteral routes. PVP is not a primary irritant, skin fatiguing material or a sensitiser.",
