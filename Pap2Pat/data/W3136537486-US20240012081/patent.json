                        "MRI is a non-invasive, non-ionizing imaging technique that makes it possible to produce two- or three-dimensional tomographic images of the inside of the human body. By virtue of a wide variety of existing acquisition sequences, MRI offers the possibility of evaluating both the anatomical and functional characteristics of organs, with high levels of contrast between tissues. It is of great use when a very fine analysis is necessary and certain lesions are not visible on standard X-rays, ultrasounds, or the scanner.",
                        "The MRI principle is based on the magnetic properties of hydrogen atoms, which are contained, to varying degrees, in all tissues of the human body.",
                        "By using powerful magnets, the protons of the hydrogen atoms of the body are stimulated simultaneously, which has the effect of aligning their spin magnetic moments in the direction of the magnetic field produced. The sum of the magnetic moments contained in spin samples, called isochromates, corresponds to the magnetization vector. Once this first step has been completed, the atoms are brought into resonance by making them undergo excitation by a magnetic field (radiofrequency). When the stimulation is stopped, the atoms return energy whose intensity is measured and analyzed. Not all tissues contain the same quantity of hydrogen atoms, and the energy level returned will differ according to the tissue composition. The analysis of these data by computers makes it possible to reconstitute images in two and three dimensions and in the three planes of space.",
                        "The MRI apparatus contains gradient coils, placed on three axes of a 3D plane. The electric current that passes through these gradient coils produces a local distortion of the main magnetic field. This distortion is used for spatial encoding of the images. It makes it possible, on each axis of a 3D plane (x, y and z), to locate one point in particular. For this, three gradient coils are used: one to reconstitute each of the three planes of 3D MRI images.",
                        "To perform an MRI, the patient is placed in a magnet that emits a permanent magnetic field Bo, typically 1.5 T or 3 T. This environment stable to hydrogen nuclei disseminated in the human body, to be found in a state of equilibrium. In order to initiate the resonance phenomenon, the supply of energy is carried out via the emission of another specific magnetic field called Bi, which is a field rotating at the Larmor frequency of the hydrogen nuclei, that is a radiofrequency wave of 128 MHz for 3 Tesla magnets, and of 64 MHz for 1.5 T magnets. All hydrogen nuclei of the patient absorb this energy and are therefore in an excited state. When the application of this magnetic field Bi is stopped, all the hydrogen nuclei dissipate the accumulated energy and gradually return to their state of equilibrium. This is when the image is acquired.",
                        "The return to equilibrium of the hydrogen nuclei (also called relaxation) is not instantaneous: It therefore requires time. This relaxation phenomenon is characterized by two time constants\u2014T1 and T2\u2014translating this latency of return to equilibrium. Next, the hydrogen nuclei return at varying speeds to their state of equilibrium depending on the environment (or tissue) in which they are located. This therefore results in a reduction or relative increase in relaxation times T1 and T2.",
                        "The excitation is carried out by applying a sequence of repeated pulsed RF signals, with echo times TE and repetition times TR forming a reference pattern.",
                        "The relaxation signal is captured by the antennas of the MRI imager, which deliver a digital signal that is the subject of processing to turn it into an image. MRI image reconstruction is based on a multidimensional Fourier transform.",
                        "The many instruments and different processing steps necessary for the formation of an image give rise to multiple sources of errors that are generally difficult to characterize. Indeed, the magnetic characteristics of the object (relaxation time, proton density), instrumentation (permanent magnet, gradient coils, radio-frequency antennas), and the acquisition and reconstruction parameters (echo time, spatiotemporal resolution, sampling frequency) are just some of the factors that affect the quality of the MRI signal and may alter the image. In practice, distortions result in variations in the position and intensity of the voxels on the images relative to their actual position.",
                        "However, the quality of the MRI image is crucial for the relevance of the diagnosis and use of this information for a therapy, in particular for the diagnosis and precise location of a tumor for therapeutic treatment and for adjusting margins in the context of ablation or radiotherapy. Identifying the factors responsible for image distortions thus represents a way of optimizing the MRI measurement.",

It involves carrying out an acquisition of the MRI flow data by phase contrast imaging from a physical phantom supplied with a reference fluid feed sequence, to record a second digital data file measured experimentally, then to carry out steps of resetting, correcting, and shaping of the data, these steps being necessary for spatiotemporal compatibility, before proceeding to compare the digital data files in order to calculate at least one error indicator representative of the differences between the digital files.",

Furthermore, by acquiring an MRI image of such a phantom, it is impossible to determine the origin of any degradations in quality."

Indeed, the appliance\n    manufacturers generally offer clinical protocols equipped with\n    pre-established sequence parameters as a function of the type of\n    imaging to be carried out. These sequences can be adapted directly\n    on-site, or by the application engineer during software updates. It\n    is therefore possible to see poorly calibrated or obsolete protocols\n    still being used in practice.",

To ensure a spatial match with the MRI image, the geometry of the virtual phantom is resampled on a voxel image, of the same size and spatial resolution as the acquisition matrix. In the case of Cartesian filling of k-space, the effects of truncation and sampling of the Fourier space are also taken into account by applying spatial filtering as defined in (Haacke, M. E., R. W. Brown, M. R. Thompson and R. Venkatesan Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design. Wiley-Liss. Haacke, 1999) during the resampling process of the virtual phantom. The errors associated with the reconstruction of the image can be estimated by comparing the reference image with and without the application of this filtering. In the case of a non-Cartesian filling of k-space, these effects are taken into account by applying a Fourier transform to the resampled image in order to design a reference k-space.",

                        "A collateral branch (14) has been established by analogy with the collateral arteries. The size of this collateral branch was designed to reproduce the resolution observed in vivo between the aorta and the supra-aortic trunk, celiac, renal and iliac arteries.",
                        "Finally, the protuberance (15) attached to the intersection between the collateral branch (14) and the main branch (13) simulates the blood flows in aortic aneurysms, but also makes it possible to assess the vortices present in the heart chambers.",
                        "The shape of the phantom is first made numerically with computer-aided design software. The CAD file then constitutes the digital base to prepare, on the one hand, a hemodynamic digital phantom and, on the other hand, the physical phantom, by a 3D-printing technique based on stereolithography.",
                        "The physical phantom is placed in the MRI equipment, in place of the patient, after having been placed in a pouch filled with a gel. It is supplied by a circuit comprising a pump (6) and a flow meter (7) as well as a buffer tank (8). The pump (6) is computer-controlled to provide reproducible waveforms. The fluid has hydrodynamic characteristics that are close to those of blood in general circulation, viscosity=4 cPoi and density=1020 kg/m 3 and the known longitudinal and transverse relaxation times at 1.5 T (T1=0.85 and T2=0.17).",
                        "The pump delivers a pulsed flow rate that is controlled at all times by the flow meter (7). The pressure sensors make it possible to validate the hydrostatic pressure maps reconstructed from the velocity maps.",
                        "From a clinical point of view, it is particularly advantageous to characterize measurement errors for 4D flow MRI sequences in order to best quantify the reliability and accuracy of the reconstructed hemodynamic markers by virtue of this technique. This methodology applied to 4D flow MRI therefore makes it possible to evaluate the ability of a clinical protocol to quantify a flow.",

Several comparisons with idealized MRI measurements made it possible to validate the simulations and the flow within the MRI phantom (1). The steps and results of this validation are detailed in (Puiseux T, Sewonu A, Meyrignac O, et al. Reconciling PC-MRI and CFD: an in vitro study. NMR in Biomedicine. 2019).

                        "Sequence-Related Error Identification",
                        "This first step consists of simulating the 4D flow MRI sequence from the reference flow in order to reconstruct the image and thus the velocity field that should be obtained by an ideal acquisition (without experimental errors).",
                        "To simulate the acquisition of a 4D flow MRI sequence, the volume of the MRI phantom (1) is discretized into a digital mesh consisting of tetrahedral elements. The Bloch equations are numerically solved on Lagrangian particles deposited periodically at each repetition time within the fluid domain, and simultaneously moved by following the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The magnetic field that appears in the Bloch equations is represented by the MRI sequence in question and is updated at each iteration. The MRI signals resulting from the relaxation properties of the particles encoded in space and speed are collected sequentially during the application of the reading gradients, and stored in a Fourier space. The periodic pulsed flow imposed by the pump is divided into several time phases, and a virtual image is reconstructed by 3D inverse Fourier transform for each of these phases. Finally, each image reconstructed by the MRI simulation is compared to the reference image corresponding to the same phase.",
                        "To construct a reference image compatible with an image obtained by MRI, the reference flow is degraded in space and in time. In order to reproduce the effect by sequential filling of the k-space, the solutions obtained by CFD over time are previously averaged in phase over a duration of 40 time periods.",
                        "The phase-averaged numerical solution is then resampled on a Cartesian grid of the same size and resolution as the simulated image. To do this, at each node of the mesh a spatial filtering is applied that takes into account the discrete truncation and sampling effects of the Fourier space, thus making it possible to reproduce the errors related to the image reconstruction process.",
                        "The differences observed between the velocity field reconstructed by MRI simulation and the resampled reference flow on the voxel grid (see FIG. 4) then correspond to distortions caused purely by the limitations of the MRI sequence and its acquisition parameters. For this case study, a maximum error is observed that is approximately equal to 20% of the encoding rate.",
                        "It is sometimes possible to more deeply characterize these errors by a finer analysis of the characteristics of the sequence.",
                        "FIGS. 4 to 6 show the standard of the velocity field obtained at the systolic peak by MRI simulation (uSMRI) (FIG. 4) and by CFD (uCFD) (FIG. 5) as well as the error defined as \u2225uSMRI\u2212uvox\u2225 where uvox corresponds to the CFD field and resampled on the voxel grid (FIG. 6).",
                        "FIG. 7 shows the spatial structures of greater acceleration in the reference flow. FIG. 8 shows the largest velocity errors in the synthetic MRI at the corresponding time. The similarities observed between these two quantities suggest the presence of an acceleration artifact. Indeed, a hypothesis inherent to the 4D flow MRI sequences is that there is a linear relationship between the phase and the position of a nuclear spin. In other words, the effects induced by the acceleration of the spins are ignored in the sequences of 4D flows.",
                        "This first step makes it possible to quantify the level of error introduced by certain approximations of the sequence. By characterizing the observed image artifacts, this methodology may also be extended to the optimization of MRI sequences.",
                        "Identifying Machine Malfunctions",
                        "Insofar as the reference flow is similar to the experimental flow within the MRI phantom, the comparison between the images acquired experimentally and those simulated by means of the same 4D flow MRI sequence enables the identification of possible malfunctions of the instrumentation system.",
                        "The experimentally reconstructed images are compared with the images obtained by MRI simulation. The differences observed between the two velocity fields indicate machine errors. The velocities reconstructed by experimental and synthetic MRI are compared with the reference image in FIGS. 9 and 10. Similar error structures can be distinguished, showing that experimental MRI clearly reproduces the acceleration artifact discussed in the preceding part. It is also possible to note a systematically higher error level of experimental MRI, suggesting the presence of distortions due to the instrumentation. The evaluation of the operation of the instrumentation system does not require a complex sequence to be acquired. In fact, single MRI sequences composed of elementary magnetic pulses are theoretically sufficient to warn of any malfunctions. For example, this can make it possible to separately test the different magnetic field gradient coils."
