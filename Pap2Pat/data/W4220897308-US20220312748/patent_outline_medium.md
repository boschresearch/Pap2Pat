### Example 1: Generation of DRAG and DRAG80 Mouse Strains

- generate HLA-DR4 Tg, Abb KO, Rag2 KO mice
- generate HLA-DR4 Tg, hCD80 Tg, Abb KO, Rag2 KO mice
- generate DRAG mice
- generate DRAG80 mice
- describe genetic construction of RIP-hCD80

### Example 2: Functionality Testing of DRAG and DRAG80 Transgenic Mouse

- introduce DRAG and DRAG80 transgenic mouse
- describe irradiation and injection of human hematopoietic stem cells
- compare human T cell reconstitution and frequencies in DRAG and control mice
- assess function of human T cells developed by DRAG
- demonstrate development of human regulatory CD4+FOXP3+ T cells
- show development of serum levels of human IgM and IgG
- demonstrate development of human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 subclasses
- show ability to elicit specific IgG antibodies upon vaccination

### Prophetic Example 3: Functionality Test for DRAG80

- describe expression of human CD80 in transfected cells

### Example 4: Generation of DRAGA Mouse Model
