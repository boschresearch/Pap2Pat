    "abstract": "This invention relates to a transgenic animal model for testing immunogenicity and protective efficacy of human vaccines and the method for generating such a multi-transgenic animal. This invention also relates to methods for screening compositions for human vaccine development. More specifically, the present invention relates to a mouse model capable of expressing human leukocyte antigens DR4 and A2, and/or human costimulatory molecules (CD80) which upon infusion of human HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cells develop a functional human immune system able to respond to vaccination with human vaccines. The invention also relates to method of producing human antibodies specific for a desired antigen using the transgenic mouse.",

                        "Human vaccine research often requires in vivo analysis to test the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and toxicity of certain vaccine candidates. However, in vivo human study is severely limited due to ethical and technical constraints. There is a growing need for an animal model to carry out in vivo studies of human cells, tissues and organs, without putting individuals at risk. Many important studies have been carried out using mice as an animal model in research of complex human biological systems. The development of \u201chumanized mouse\u201d, provide an opportunity to study human biological processes in vivo that would otherwise not be possible. In recent years, many mouse models were developed with different genetic manipulations designed to meet the needs of in vivo studies of human systems (See Table 2). Although, current mouse models permit long-term hematopoiesis of human B cells (2, 3), they only allow poor development of functional human T cells (2-5). These mouse models also fail to develop serum levels of human IgM and IgG comparable to that of human blood (3). Furthermore, upon vaccination, infection, or transplantation, current humanized mouse models do not elicit immune responses in the same extent as vaccinated or infected humans (2-5, 7-9).",
                        "In previously applications (U.S. Patent Application No. 61/386,118 and PCT application PCT/US11/001656) we disclosed a humanized mice capable of expressing HLA class II (DR4) molecules and knockout (KO) for Rag and IL2Rgc genes (DRAG). The DRAG mice when infused with HLA-matched human hematopoietic stem cells can develop a functional human immune system consisting of human CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (PLoS ONE 6: e19826, 2011, PCT/US11/001656).",
                        "However, the DRAG mice do not express human HLA class I molecules. As such, the human CD8 T cells developed by DRAG mice are likely to be restricted by mouse MHC class I molecules. Since CD8 T cells are important effector cells for elimination of pathogens, a fully humanized mouse, or a mouse-human chimera, as described in this application, can overcome the constraints of the DRAG and other current mouse models, and may become an important research tool for in vivo studies.",
                        "The new humanized mouse model (DRAGA) is capable of co-expressing HLA class I and class II molecules in such a way that the human CD8 T cells developed by these mice are only restricted by human MHC class I molecules. Three other mouse strains are also generated in the process of creating the DRAGA mouse, with each displaying additional phenotypes. DRAGAB and DRAGAB80 also have knockout for mouse beta-2-microglobulin (B2m). The B2mKO mutation prevents expression of mouse MHC class I molecules and ensures that all human CD8 T cells are restricted by HLA class I molecules. DRAG80 and DRAGAB80 also express human CD80 in the pancreatic beta cells (hCD80), which may facilitate the autoimmune attack of human T cell on pancreas and development of type 1 diabetes. All four new mouse strains of this application are summarized below.",
                        "Efficacy of passive transfer of human hyper-immune sera containing polyclonal immunoglobulins (Igs) has been widely proven in clinical trials for infectious diseases, including malaria [15]. However, the use of human hyper-immune sera has been has hampered for clinical use, due to the low reproducibility between clinical batches [14].",
                        "The advent of technologies to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from mice and rats, which was first reported by Kolher and Milstein [16], has overcome many of the challenges associated with the use of human hyper-immune sera. OKT3, a mouse anti-human CD3, was the first mAb tested in human trials, and proven efficacious for prevention of organ rejection by inactivation of human T cells [17]. However, due to the mouse origin of OKT3 mAb, severe anaphylactic reactions were reported, and thereby the use of mAbs generated from animals has been discouraged for further clinical use [18].",
                        "In order to prevent anaphylactic reactions, technologies were aimed at genetic re-engineering of the animal mAb-Fc-backbone by human equivalents, although immune reactions against the mouse variable-Ig component could not be avoided [19]. A parallel approach involves the use of transgenic mice expressing part of the human Ig gene repertoire (XENOMOUSE\u2122), which after immunization could be used to generate fully human mAbs [20]. Two licensed \u201cfully human mAbs\u201d generated using XENOMOUSE\u2122 are panitumumab (Amgen, Washington D.C.) and denosumab (Amgen, Washington D.C.). Both products are currently being tested in human trials against colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis, respectively. Despite the success of XENOMOUSE\u2122 for production of fully human mAbs, this approach still faces some challenges. First, the XENOMOUSE\u2122 is proprietary (Abgenix, Fremont Calif.), preventing widespread public use. Secondly, the mouse B cells in XENOMOUSE\u2122 have been shown to be going through a different maturation process from that of human B cells [20]. This raises questions as to the ability of XENOMOUSE\u2122 to generate high-avidity, neutralizing mAbs against infectious agents. Furthermore, both panitumumab and denosumab are antibodies to human self-proteins (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor \u03ba B (RANK), respectively). Currently no neutralizing human mAbs against infectious diseases have been generated so far using the XENOMOUSE\u2122. The use of human B cells from immunized-humans to generate human mAbs has been long envisioned as a strategy to avoid all the problems above mentioned. However, the generation of human mAbs using human B cells has been hindered by the very low frequency of antibody-producing human B cells in blood (10\u22124 to 10\u22126) [21] since activated B cells (plasma cells) are homed in lymphoid organs and bone marrow [22]. Consequently, while spleen biopsies have been shown as a very successful source of human B cells for generating human mAbs [23], the use of human peripheral blood as source of B cells has only led to a handful of successful attempts [24-26]. Furthermore, the successful attempts for generation of human mAbs using blood-derived human B cells requires prior transformation of B cells with Epstein Barr-virus, a relevant human pathogen, which imposes difficulties for their further development for clinical use.",
                        "The ability of new mouse model of this invention and that of the related application to generate fully human B cells that respond to vaccination provides a novel and unique resource to overcome all above mentioned challenges for product development. From these mice, we can obtain large numbers of antigen specific B cells from their lymphoid organs as sources for generation of human mAbs against infectious agents or toxin, such as liver and blood stage P. falciparum malaria. There has not been any successful attempts to generate \u201chumanized\u201d or \u201cfully human\u201d mAbs against human malaria parasites."
