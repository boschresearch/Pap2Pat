# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate humanized mouse model
- limitations of current mouse models
- introduce new humanized mouse model

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- define key terms and concepts

### Definitions

- define transgene and knockout mutation
- define transgenic and knockout animals
- define humanized mouse and various breeding terms
- define MHC, HLA, and other immunological terms

### Example 1: Generation of DRAG and DRAG80 Mouse Strains

- describe generation of HLA-DR4 Tg, Abb KO, Rag2 KO mice
- describe generation of DRAG and DRAG80 mice

### Example 2: Functionality Testing of DRAG and DRAG80 Transgenic Mouse

- test functionality of DRAG mice
- compare human T cell reconstitution in DRAG and control mice
- assess development of functional human T cells and regulatory CD4+FOXP3+ T cells
- evaluate development of serum levels of human IgM and IgG

### Prophetic Example 3: Functionality Test for DRAG80

- test expression of human CD80 in transfected cells

### Example 4: Generation of DRAGA Mouse Model

- generate DRAGA mouse model co-expressing human leukocyte antigen DR4 and A2

### Example 5: Functionality Testing of Transgenic Mouse DRAGA

- test expression of HLA-DR4 and HLA-A2 molecules in DRAGA mice

### Prophetic Example 6: Testing DRAGA Mice and Derivates' Ability to Elicit HLA-A2.1-Specific Cytotoxic Cells Upon Immunization

- test ability of DRAGA mice to elicit HLA-A2.1-specific cytotoxic cells upon immunization

### Prophetic Example 7: Generate Therapeutic Human Monoclonal Antibodies to Infectious Agent Using DRAG Mice as Source of Human B Cells

- generate therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies to infectious agent using DRAG mice
