                        "Breast cancer is responsible for the second overall cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Currently, prevention of breast cancer predominantly involves reducing modifiable risks including early detection through physical examination and mammograms, avoidance of unnecessary post-menopausal hormone therapy, reduction in alcohol consumption, loss of weight, increase in physical activity, and genetic testing for mutations of the breast cancer type 1 and type 2 susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively). More aggressive approaches in high risk patients include chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors as well as prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy.",
                        "Despite the profound health risk of breast cancer and inadequacy of preventative efforts, an immunotherapy for breast cancer has not been developed as an integral part of the standard of care. Tumor-specific antigens have long provided less than optimal results as targets for cancer vaccination. The overall goal of cancer vaccination has traditionally been to boost the latent immune response to tumor-specific antigens. Approaches have included cell-based protocols involving immunization with whole autologous or allogeneic tumors, as well as antigen-based strategies involving immunization with proteins or peptides overexpressed in tumors and underexpressed in normal tissues. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and mucin (MUC1) are the predominant antigens used in human breast cancer vaccine trials. Although vaccination using these antigens may demonstrate tumor reducing effects, neither antigen provides any tissue or tumor specificity since both are expressed in a variety of normal tissues and tumors. Thus, the lack of inherent tissue specificity of HER2 and MUC1 targeted immunity may ultimately lead to substantial systemic autoimmune sequelae if a robust immune response manifests.",
                        "A full-strength autoimmune attack sufficient to induce targeted breast failure can provide effective therapy against established breast malignancies if the target antigen is constitutively expressed in breast tumors. Moreover, if the selected target antigen is expressed in normal breast tissue under conditions that are easily avoidable, then the vaccine may provide safe and effective protection against the development of breast cancer.",
                        "Human alpha-lactalbumin (\u03b1-lactalbumin) is a conditionally expressed, breast specific differentiation protein found in the majority of breast malignancies. As an integral differentiation protein involved in regulation of lactose biosynthesis, expression of \u03b1-lactalbumin is breast-specific and conditionally dependent on lactation for its expression and synthesis. Human \u03b1-lactalbumin is also constitutively overexpressed in the majority of breast tumors, is breast specific, and is sufficiently immunogenic to induce an effective proinflammatory immune response. Thus, immunization against human \u03b1-lactalbumin offers a safe and effective vaccination strategy for the prevention of breast cancer."

Adherent cell selection was followed by culture in X-VIVO media (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md.) with 500 U/ml rhGMCSF and rhlL-4 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, N.J.). Six days after initiation of culture, DCs were pulsed with 75 \u03bcg/ml of purified recombinant human \u03b1-lactalbumin (rha-lactalbumin) and were washed extensively 48 hours later. The washed DCs were co-cultured with nylon wool purified naive T cells from the same donor at a ratio of 1:5 (DCs to T cells). Approximately 72 hours after co-culture, in vitro primed T cells and unprimed T cells from the same donor were enriched by passage through nylon wool and re-cultured with \u03b3-irradiated (3000 rads) PBMC as feeder cells at a ratio of 1:10 (feeders to T cells) on ELISPOT plates (Polyfiltronics, Rockland, Mass.) pre-coated with mouse anti-human IFN\u03b3 capture antibody (#M-700A; Endogen, Cambridge, Mass.). Frequencies of \u03b1-lactalbumin reactive IFN\u03b3 producing T cells were determined 48 hours later using secondary biotinylated mouse anti-human IFN\u03b3 (#M701; Endogen) and resolution of ELISPOTS using an automated Immunospot Satellite Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, Ohio).",
