# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- fields of immunology and oncology

## BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY

- introduce breast cancer
- limitations of current prevention methods
- introduce human alpha-lactalbumin as a target antigen

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe human breast cancer vaccine
- describe adjuvant and carrier
- describe administration of vaccine
- describe proinflammatory response
- describe method of immunizing against human alpha-lactalbumin
- describe method of activating T cells
- describe vaccine for preventing or treating breast cancer
- describe method of treating cancer

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

- demonstrate immunization with alpha-lactalbumin activates T cells

### Example 2

- demonstrate immunization with alpha-lactalbumin fails to induce breast inflammation

### Example 3

- demonstrate prophylactic alpha-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits growth of breast tumors

### Example 4

- demonstrate alpha-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits growth of established transplanted breast tumors

### Example 5

- demonstrate alpha-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits growth of established autochthonous breast tumors

### Example 6

- demonstrate alpha-lactalbumin-specific T cells induce tumor inflammation and cytotoxicity

### Example 7

- demonstrate inhibition of breast tumor growth by alpha-lactalbumin vaccination is mediated by T cells

### Example 8

- assess T cell repertoire availability
- demonstrate in vitro priming against alpha-lactalbumin
- demonstrate recall response to alpha-lactalbumin
