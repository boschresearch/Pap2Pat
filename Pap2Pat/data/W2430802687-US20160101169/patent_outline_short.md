## BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY

- background and motivation for breast cancer vaccine

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- disclose human breast cancer vaccine
- describe vaccine composition and administration
- describe method of immunizing against human α-lactalbumin
- describe method of treating cancer with human α-lactalbumin

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

- α-lactalbumin immunization activates T cells

### Example 2

- immunization of non-lactating mice with α-lactalbumin

### Example 3

- prophylactic α-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits breast tumor growth

### Example 4

- α-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits growth of established breast tumors

### Example 5

- α-lactalbumin vaccination inhibits growth of established autochthonous breast tumors

### Example 6

- α-lactalbumin-specific T cells induce tumor inflammation and cytotoxicity

### Example 7

- inhibition of breast tumor growth by α-lactalbumin vaccination is mediated by T cells

### Example 8
