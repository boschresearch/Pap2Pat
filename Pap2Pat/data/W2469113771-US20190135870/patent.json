                        "Gene therapy has most commonly been investigated and achieved using viral vectors, in particular adeno-associated viral vectors. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a replication-deficient parvovirus, the single-stranded DNA genome of which is about 4.7 kb in length. The AAV genome includes inverted terminal repeat (ITRs) at both ends of the molecule, flanking two open reading frames: cap and rep. The cap gene encodes three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3. The three capsid proteins typically assemble in a ratio of 1:1:10 to form the AAV capsid, although AAV capsids containing only VP3, or VP1 and VP3, or VP2 and VP3, have been produced. The cap gene also encodes the assembly activating protein (AAP) from an alternative open reading frame. AAP promotes capsid assembly, acting to target the capsid proteins to the nucleolus and promote capsid formation. The rep gene encodes four regulatory proteins: Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40. These Rep proteins are involved in AAV genome replication.",
                        "The ITRs are involved in several functions, in particular integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome, as well as genome replication and packaging. When AAV infects a host cell, the viral genome integrates into the host's chromosome resulting in latent infection of the cell. Thus, AAV can be exploited to introduce heterologous sequences into cells. In a natural system, a helper virus (for example, adenovirus or herpesvirus) provides genes that allow for production of AAV virus in the infected cell. In the case of adenovirus, genes E1A, E1B, E2A, E4 and VA provide helper functions. Upon infection with a helper virus, the AAV provirus is rescued and amplified, and both AAV and adenovirus are produced.",
                        "Recombinant AAVs containing a genome that lacks some, most or all of the native AAV genome and instead contains one or more heterologous sequences flanked by the ITRs have been successfully used in gene therapy settings. One of the major problems associated with the use of recombinant AAV is the pre-existing immunity in patients to AAV, particularly the AAV serotypes that most commonly circulate among humans, such as AAV2. The immune response is almost entirely directed to the capsid protein. Another problem is the limited tropism of the commonly used recombinant AAV virions. Thus, there is a continued need for alternative recombinant AAV virions, in particular those that contain capsid proteins that are distinct from those of the AAV serotypes in circulation and that are resistant to pre-existing immunity to AAV, and those with broader or different tropism."

Nucleic acid molecules containing the various mAAV-EVE1 genes, such as the capsid gene (cap) and fragments thereof, can be used to produce rAAV virions. The cap gene of mAAV-EVE1 and the encoded capsid polypeptides have limited homology to other known AAV serotypes. As a result, rAAV virions comprising these capsid polypeptides or fragments thereof are particularly useful for gene therapy in humans because pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies are unlikely to cross-react with the rAAV virions. The rAAV virions may also exhibit altered tropism, which may confer enhanced performance on the AAV system for gene addition and/or genome editing functions.",

In particular examples, the vectors also comprise nucleic acid encoding an AAP protein, such as a mAAV-EVE1 AAP protein or fragment thereof as described herein or an AAP protein from another AAV serotype; and/or also comprise nucleic acid encoding a Rep protein, such as a mAAV-EVE1 Rep protein or fragment thereof as described herein or a Rep protein from another AAV serotype.",

For example, in such embodiments, the vector may be co-transfected into a host cell with an AAV vector containing a heterologous sequence flanked by ITRs and a helper plasmid or helper virus such that rAAV virions containing the mAAV-EVE1 capsid polypeptides and encapsidating the heterologous sequence is produced. In other embodiments, the vectors are AAV vectors that provide the mAAV-EVE1 capsid polypeptides or fragments thereof in cis for the production of rAAV virions containing the capsid polypeptides. For such examples, the AAV vector typically also contains a heterologous sequence that will be packaged into the rAAV virion.",
                                "Thus, in some embodiments, the vectors of the present invention also comprise a heterologous sequence. The heterologous sequence may be operably linked a promoter to facilitate expression of the sequence. The heterologous sequence can encode a peptide or polypeptide, such as a therapeutic peptide or polypeptide, or can encode a polynucleotide or transcript that itself has a function or activity, such as an antisense or inhibitory oligonucleotide, including antisense DNA and RNA (e.g. miRNA, siRNA, and shRNA). In some examples, the heterologous sequence is a stretch of nucleic acids that is essentially homologous to a stretch of nucleic acids in the genomic DNA of an animal, such that when the heterologous sequence is introduced into a cell of the animal, homologous recombination between the heterologous sequence and the genomic DNA can occur. As would be appreciated, the nature of the heterologous sequence is not essential to the present disclosure. In particular embodiments, the vectors comprising the heterologous sequence(s) will be used in gene therapy.",
                                "In particular examples, the heterologous sequence encodes a peptide or polypeptide, or polynucleotide, whose expression is of therapeutic use, such as, for example, for the treatment of a disease or disorder. For example, expression of a therapeutic peptide or polypeptide may serve to restore or replace the function of the endogenous form of the peptide or polypeptide that is defective (i.e. gene replacement therapy). In other examples, expression of a therapeutic peptide or polypeptide, or polynucleotide, from the heterologous sequence serves to alter the levels and/or activity of one or more other peptides, polypeptides or polynucleotides in the host cell. Thus, according to particular embodiments, the expression of a heterologous sequence introduced by a vector described herein into a host cell can be used to provide a therapeutic amount of a peptide, polypeptide or polynucleotide to ameliorate the symptoms of a disease or disorder. In other instance, the heterologous sequence is a stretch of nucleic acids that is essentially homologous to a stretch of nucleic acids in the genomic DNA of an animal, such that when the heterologous sequence is introduced into a cell of the animal, homologous recombination between the heterologous sequence and the genomic DNA can occur. Accordingly, the introduction of a heterologous sequence by a vector or rAAV described herein into a host cell can be used to correct mutations in genomic DNA, which in turn can ameliorate the symptoms of a disease or disorder.",
                                "In embodiments where the vector is an AAV vector, the heterologous sequence is flanked by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAV ITRs to allow packaging of the heterologous sequence into a rAAV virion. AAV ITRs used in the vectors of the invention need not have a wild-type nucleotide sequence, and may be altered, e.g., by the insertion, deletion or substitution of nucleotides. Additionally, AAV ITRs may be derived from any of several AAV serotypes, including without limitation, AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7 and AAV8, etc. Such ITRs and vectors comprising them are well known in the art.",
                                "Vectors suitable for use in mammalian cells are widely described and well-known in the art. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that vectors of the present invention may also contain additional sequences and elements useful for the replication of the vector in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells, selection of the vector and the expression of a heterologous sequence in a variety of host cells. For example, the vectors of the present disclosure can include a prokaryotic replicon (that is, a sequence having the ability to direct autonomous replication and maintenance of the vector extrachromosomally in a prokaryotic host cell, such as a bacterial host cell. Such replicons are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the vectors can include a shuttle element that makes the vectors suitable for replication and integration in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In addition, vectors may also include a gene whose expression confers a detectable marker such as a drug resistance gene, which allows for selection and maintenance of the host cells. Vectors may also have a reportable marker, such as gene encoding a fluorescent or other detectable protein.",
                                "The vectors of the present invention comprise promoters that facilitate expression of an operably linked coding region, such as a cap, aap or rep gene or heterologous sequence. In some examples, the promoters are AAV promoters, such as the p5, p19 or p40 promoter. In other example, the promoters are derived from other sources. Examples of constitutive promoters include, without limitation, the retroviral Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR promoter (optionally with the RSV enhancer), the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (optionally with the CMV enhancer), the SV40 promoter, the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, the \u03b2-actin promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EF1\u03b1, promoter. Inducible promoters allow regulation of gene expression and can be regulated by exogenously supplied compounds, environmental factors such as temperature, or the presence of a specific physiological state, e.g., acute phase, a particular differentiation state of the cell, or in replicating cells only. Non-limiting examples of inducible promoters regulated by exogenously supplied promoters include the zinc-inducible sheep metallothionine (MT) promoter, the dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, the T7 polymerase promoter system; the ecdysone insect promoter, the tetracycline-repressible system, the tetracycline-inducible system, the RU486-inducible system and the rapamycin-inducible system. Still other types of inducible promoters which may be useful in this context are those which are regulated by a specific physiological state, e.g., temperature, acute phase, a particular differentiation state of the cell, or in replicating cells only. In some embodiments, tissue specific promoters are used. Non-limiting examples of such promoters include the liver-specific thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) promoter, insulin promoter, glucagon promoter, somatostatin promoter, pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) promoter, synapsin-1 (Syn) promoter, creatine kinase (MCK) promoter, mammalian desmin (DES) promoter, a \u03b1-myosin heavy chain (a-MHC) promoter, a cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) promoter, beta-actin promoter, and hepatitis B virus core promoter. The selection of an appropriate promoter is well within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art.",
                                "The vectors can also include transcriptional enhancers, translational signals, and transcriptional and translational termination signals. Examples of transcriptional termination signals include, but are not limited to, polyadenylation signal sequences, such as bovine growth hormone (BGH) poly(A), SV40 late poly(A), rabbit beta-globin (RBG) poly(A), thymidine kinase (TK) poly(A) sequences, and any variants thereof. In some embodiments, the transcriptional termination region is located downstream of the posttranscriptional regulatory element. In some embodiments, the transcriptional termination region is a polyadenylation signal sequence.",
                                "The vectors can include various posttranscriptional regulatory elements. In some embodiments, the posttranscriptional regulatory element can be a viral posttranscriptional regulatory element. Non-limiting examples of viral posttranscriptional regulatory element include woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), hepatitis B virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (HBVPRE), RNA transport element, and any variants thereof. The RTE can be a rev response element (RRE), for example, a lentiviral RRE. A non-limiting example is bovine immunodeficiency virus rev response element (RRE). In some embodiments, the RTE is a constitutive transport element (CTE). Examples of CTE include, but are not limited to Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus CTE and Avian Leukemia Virus CTE.",
                                "A signal peptide sequence can also be included in the vector to provide for secretion of a polypeptide from a mammalian cell. Examples of signal peptides include, but are not limited to, the endogenous signal peptide for HGH and variants thereof; the endogenous signal peptide for interferons and variants thereof, including the signal peptide of type I, II and III interferons and variants thereof; and the endogenous signal peptides for known cytokines and variants thereof, such as the signal peptide of erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, TGF-\u03b21, TNF, IL1-\u03b1, and IL1-\u03b2, and variants thereof. Typically, the nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide is located immediately upstream of the heterologous sequence (e.g., fused at the 5\u2032 of the coding region of the protein of interest) in the vector. In instances where the vector does not include a heterologous sequence, a signal sequence can be included in the vector downstream of the promoter so that upon insertion of a heterologous sequence, the signal peptide is in-frame with the heterologous sequence.",
                                "In further examples, the vectors can contain a regulatory sequence that allows, for example, the translation of multiple proteins from a single mRNA. Non-limiting examples of such regulatory sequences include internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and 2A self-processing sequence, such as a 2A peptide site from foot-and-mouth disease virus (F2A sequence).",

Exemplary of such techniques are capsid shuffling techniques, which utilize multiple capsid genes that are then \u201cshuffled\u201d to generate a chimeric capsid gene, typically a library of chimeric capsid genes. These can then be used to produce rAAV comprising chimeric capsid proteins. Generally, a library of rAAV is produced, which is then screened to identify capsids and rAAV having desirable traits, such as reduced immunogenicity, reduced cross-reactivity and altered or improved cell tropism. The nucleic acids molecules of the present invention can therefore be used in such methods to produce a chimeric capsid and rAAV comprising the chimeric capsid. Accordingly, the present disclosure is also directed to methods for producing chimeric capsid genes, methods for producing vectors comprising the genes, methods for producing chimeric capsids polypeptides encoded by the genes and methods for producing rAAV comprising the chimeric capsids. Also contemplated are capsid genes, capsid gene libraries, vectors, vector libraries, capsid polypeptides, capsid polypeptide libraries, rAAV and rAAV libraries produced by these methods.",
                                "Various capsid shuffling methods have been described in the art. These include \u201cDNA family shuffling\u201d techniques, which have been used to generate diverse libraries of many types of proteins. DNA family shuffling involves in vitro recombination of related genes (in this instance, capsid genes) with >50% homology. The genes are first enzymatically fragmented and then reassembled based on partial homology, resulting in libraries of chimeric genes. DNA family shuffling techniques to produce chimeric capsids have been well described, such as by Grimm et al. (J. Virol. 2008. 82:5887-5911), Koerber et al. (Mol Ther. 2008. 16: 1703-1709), and Li et al. (Mol Ther. 2008. 16: 1252-1260) in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,588,772 and 9,169,299, and are well known to those of skill in the art. Such methods can be performed using the nucleic acids provided herein that encode a capsid polypeptide of the invention.",
                                "Briefly, the methods can include providing two or more different capsid genes from two or more AAV serotypes, wherein one capsid gene encodes a capsid polypeptide of the present disclosure; enzymatically digesting the capsid genes, such as with DNase I, to produce fragments; and reassembling the fragments into chimeric capsid genes which produces a library of chimeric plasmid genes. Reassembly of the gene fragments can be performed by PCR. Because of the related nature of the different capsid genes, the gene fragments have overlapping regions of homology that allow the fragments to self prime in the absence of additional primer in the PCR. Thus, non-primer driven PCR can be used to assemble the fragments into chimeric capsid genes that contain capsid regions from multiple AAV serotypes. In some embodiments, primer-driven PCR is then also used to further amplify the chimeric capsid genes. The method can therefore produce a chimeric capsid gene encoding a chimeric capsid polypeptide that contains a fragment, region or domain of a capsid polypeptide of the present invention. The fragment, region or domain may comprise, for example, one or more of the variable regions (VR), including VR-I, VR-II, VR-III, VR-IV, VR-V, VR-VI, VR-VII, VR-VIII and/or VR-IX, and/or the PLA2 domain, as described above. Typically, a library of chimeric capsid genes is produced.",
                                "The chimeric genes can then be inserted into vectors. This can result in the generation of a vector library. The vectors may be, for example, basic plasmids that facilitate subsequent cloning, amplification, replication and/or expression. In other instances, the vectors are AAV vectors that contain AAV ITRs and a rep gene, which facilitate production of rAAV comprising a chimeric capsid protein. The AAV vectors can be introduced into a host cell under conditions that facilitate the production of rAAV virions. Such conditions are well known in the art and are briefly described above. For example, a helper virus or a helper plasmid can be introduced into the host cell with the rAAV vector. In this way, a rAAV virion comprising chimeric capsid polypeptides, such as chimeric capsid polypeptides comprising a fragment, domain or region of a capsid polypeptide of the present invention, may be produced. In instances where a vector library is introduced into host cells, a library of rAAV will be produced."

For example, the mAAV-EVE nucleic acid sequences, including those set forth in SEQ ID NOs:3-20, 22, 29, 32, 33, 36 or 37 can be used to detect other AAV sequences, such as other endogenous \u201cancestral\u201d or \u201cfossil\u201d AAV sequences. This detection of other AAV sequences can be achieved using any of the methods known the art, including, but not limited to, the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using AAV-specific primers, or the use of detectable AAV-specific oligonucleotide probes. For example, genomic DNA isolated from cells of animal can be screened for the presence of AAV sequences by PCR using PCR primers (i.e. a 5\u2032 primer and a 3\u2032 primer) designed using the mAAV-EVE sequences of the present disclosure. The primers have a sequence sufficiently complementary to, or the same as, a sequence flanking a target region within the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:3-20, 22, 29, 32, 33, 36 or 37 such that the primers hybridize to a nucleic molecule containing the AAV target region under high, medium or low stringency conditions.

Briefly, 50-75 mg of tissue was placed in a 2-ml tube containing MP Lysing Matrix A. To each tube, 360 \u03bcl of ATL buffer with proteinase K (DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit; Qiagen) was added.

Amplification of the locus containing mAAV-EVE1 was initially achieved using a forward primer (AAV-EVE_flank_up, targeting the upstream flanking region: 5\u2032-GATGTTTACAGATTAGTRTTKYATCATCAGTGCTATTTYCYCWCAAWRARRATYC C-3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:25) containing multiple degenerate positions to accommodate phylogenetically diverse marsupials, and a reverse primer (AAVEVE_flank_dwn, targeting the downstream flanking region: 5\u2032-AGGGAGAGTACCTATTATCTTAATTACTGTCAGACC-3\u2032; SEQ ID NO:26). The forward primer includes a 5\u2032 non-homologous tail to facilitate reamplification. These primers amplified the locus (irrespective of its mAAV-EVE1 occupancy) from all sampled marsupials. Later, some macropodiform mAAV-EVE1 loci were amplified using a forward primer without degenerate positions (Macr(\u2212335)flank_up: 5\u2032-CCTGGAATTTGTGGGTGGAAACAATGATCC-3\u2032; SEQ ID NO: 27), specifically targeted to Macropodiformes.

                                "A maximum likelihood algorithm, as implemented in MEGA6.06, was used to infer ancestral mAAV-EVE1 nucleotide sequences from a multiple sequence alignment of sixteen macropodoid mAAV-EVE1 loci (M. robustus, M. rufus, M. parma, M. giganteus, M. eugenii, M. rufogriseus, O. unguifea, S. brachyurus, D. goodfellowi, D. matschiei, P. lateralis, T. stigmatica, L. fasciatus, A. rufescens, P. tridactylus, and H. moschatus: SEQ ID NOs: 5-20), with the inclusion of \u201cempty\u201d mAAV-EVE1 loci from related non-macropodoid marsupials (P. breviceps, P. peregrinus, S. maculatus, T. vulpecula, L. latifrons, P. cinereus, D. marsupialis, and M. domestica) serving as an outgroup. Briefly, the twenty-four member dataset was aligned using the MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment algorithm with default settings (gap open penalty=\u2212400; gap extend penalty=0; clustering method (all iterations)=UPGMB; minimum diagonal length (lambda)=24). An isolated alignment of eight outgroup nucleotides (IUPAC nucleotide code: KGRTHACY) extant within the \u201cempty locus\u201d sequences (most likely representing nucleotides lost from the stem-macropodoid locus during the exogenous AAV integration event) was removed from the alignment. A short heterogeneous region of predominantly reiterated guanosine residues occurring within the 5\u2032 portion of the mAAV-EVE rep gene was manually aligned. The most appropriate nucleotide substitution model was determined using the \u201cFind Best DNA/Protein Models\u201d function in MEGA, which determines the maximum likelihood fits of twenty-four evolutionary models given the data. For the mAAV-EVE1 dataset, the Tamura 3-parameter model with heterogeneity of substitution rates among sites modeled via a discrete Gamma distribution with five rate categories (i.e., T92+G) gave the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion score (33153.754), and was chosen as the best nucleotide substitution model for further analysis. A mAAV-EVE1 evolutionary tree was constructed in MEGA using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (substitution model =T92+G; gaps/missing data treatment=use all sites; ML heuristic method=nearest-neighbor interchange; initial tree for ML inference was generated automatically by maximum parsimony analysis). Most probable ancestral sequences at each node of the ML tree were exported as a \u201cDetailed Text Export\u201d file from the MEGA6 Tree Explorer module. The most probable ancestral sequences were extracted from the Detailed Text Export file using the command-line utility program, ExtAncSeqMEGA.exe. Due to genomic sequence deletions within mAAV-EVE1 loci occurring within the macropodoid basal taxon, H. moschatus, as well as the potoroids (A. rufescens and P. tridactylus), the full-length inferred mAAV-EVE1 sequence used for ancestral AAV modeling was derived from node 39 of the mAAV-EVE1 evolutionary tree (supplementary fig. S1), occurring at the split between Lagostrophus fasciatus and the remainder of the Macropodidae at approximately 13.8 MYA. Reading frames encoding the rep and cap genes within the inferred ancestral sequence were identified by a BLAST search of translated nucleotide databases (tblastx) for significant homology to extant AAV proteins using an ancestral mAAV-EVE1 query sequence. Using homology among the translated mAAV-EVE1 ORFs and extant dependoparvovirus protein sequence alignments as a guide, the raw mAAV-EVE1 ancestral nucleotide sequence was manually edited for frameshifts, nonsense codons, and indels. In all but one instance, frameshifts within the \u201craw\u201d inferred mAAV-EVE1 nucleotide sequence could be resolved by correction based upon a non-frameshifted member of the dataset. A frameshift occurring within mAAV-EVE rep codon 242 was corrected by arbitrary insertion of a dinucleotide sequence (TT). At various positions, the inferred mAAV-EVE ancestral sequence (Node 39 sequence) was manually edited to give precedence to nucleotides encoding amino acid residues among one or more mAAV-EVE1 sequences homologous with highly conserved extant AAV protein residues.",

A comparison of the mAAVEVE1 model to the AAV4 VP3 structure (RCSB PDB accession No. 2G8G) to identify VRs was conducted using the secondary structure matching (SSM) subroutine within PDBeFOld (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msdsrv/ssm/). VP3 VRs were defined as stretches of two or more sequential Ca positions that are >1 \u212b apart. The structures were visualized in the COOT program for further comparison of the VRs between mAAV-EVE, AAV2, AAV4, and AAV8. To enable description of the assembled mAAV-EVE1 capsid, the VP3 monomer model was used to generate a 60 mer by icosahedral matrix multiplication in the Viperdb online server (http://viperdb.scripps.edu/oligomer_multi.php).

The genetic structure of the orthologous mAAV-EVE1 sequences resembles that of contemporary AAVs (FIG. 1). The average size of the \u201cfull-length\u201d mAAV-EVE1 virus-derived sequence was approximately 4.4 kbp. The representatives of the family Potoroidae (A. rufescens and P. tridactylus) bore internal deletions of approximately 1.2 kbp, whereas the EVE recovered from H. moschatus (the sole extant member of the family Hypsiprymnodontidae) displayed an internal deletion of 1.6 kbp. Additional minor indels were distributed throughout the various mAAV-EVE1 sequences. The average GC-content of full-length, virus-derived mAAV-EVE1 sequences is approximately 43%, compared to approximately 56%, 54%, and 46% for representative extant primate AAVs (serotypes 1 through 6), avian AAVs (strains DA1 and VR-865), and the goose/Muscovy duck parvoviruses, respectively. The majority of the nucleotide substitutions were single base substitutions. The rep gene of the inferred ancestral mAAV-EVE1 genomic sequence contained three frameshift mutations and five nonsense codons (FIG. 1c). A heterogeneous region of repeated guanosine residues among the mAAV-EVE1 orthologs (resolved to glycine codons 146 and 147 of the inferred mAAV-EVE1 rep ORF) was recalcitrant to unambiguous alignment and was manually edited. The mAAV-EVE1 cap gene of the inferred genome contained three nonsense codons as well as two frameshift mutations (FIG. 1c). A putative TATA box approximately 90 bp upstream of the rep ORF and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) approximately 40 bp downstream of the cap ORF were identified in locations similar to those mapped in extant AAV genomes. A potential polyadenylation signal was also observed between the rep and cap genes of the mAAV-EVE1 sequences. A similarly located polyadenylation signal occurs within extant primate AAV genomes, and has been shown to be utilized in AAV5 (Qiu et al. 2004. J Virol 78:83-93.). ITR sequences were not identified.",

This identified \u02dc300 transcription factor binding site motifs within each promoter (314 motifs within the AAV2 P5 promoter and 297 motifs within the mAAV-EVE NS1 promoter, each with some degree of binding site signature redundancy). The two promoters shared 77 of the transcription factor binding site signature motifs. Notably, putative binding sites for two transacting factors shown to be important for the transcriptional regulation of the AAV2 P5 promoter, viz. YY1 and MLTF/USF, occur at similar locations within each promoter. Similar to the AAV2 P5 promoter, a potential YY1 binding site was identified approximately 25 bp downstream of the putative TATA box of the mAAV-EVE NS1 promoter (although the upstream \u201c\u221260\u201d YY1 site was not identified). In addition, a potential binding site for MLTF/USF was identified approximately 60 bp upstream of the putative TATA box of the mAAV-EVE1 NS1 promoter, a location similar to the MLTF/USF site mapped approximately 50 bp upstream of the TATA box of the AAV2 P5 promoter (Chang et al. 1989. J Virol 63:3479-88). Potential binding sites for equivalents of the AAV2 P19 and P40 promoters were not analyzed owing to ambiguity as to the potential location of these gene embedded promoters in the absence of transcript mapping data.",

The existence of a methionine codon at an equivalent position to the AAV2 Rep52/40 ORF suggests that the exogenous ancestor of mAAV-EVE1 encoded at least one amino-terminally truncated Rep protein. A start codon at an equivalent position to the AAV2 VP1 protein suggests that the ancestral exogenous virus also encoded a VP1-like molecule. An ACG codon at an equivalent position to that utilized by AAV2 for the translational initiation of the VP2 protein was not observed. However, subsequent comparison to other capsid sequences indicated that the VP2 protein initiates at the codon encoding position 132 with a leucyl-tRNA CTG start codon, such that the mAAV-EVE1 VP2 coding sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO:36.",

The carboxy-terminal domain of mAAV-EVE1 Rep appears unique, with no significant similarity to known protein domains.

Similar to extant dependoparvovirus Rep proteins, RCR motif I was not apparent. RCR motif II, known as the HUH motif, consists of two invariant histidine residues (positions 95 and 97 of the mAAV-EVE1 Rep protein) embedded within a patch of bulky hydrophobic amino acids (typically uHuHuuu, where u represents a hydrophobic residue).",

The AAV Rep nuclease domain fold consists of a five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet bearing the conserved RCR motifs sandwiched between flanking alpha helical clusters (FIG. 2c). The modeled mAAV-EVE1 Rep nuclease domain shows a high degree of structural similarity to the extant AAV5 domain (QMEAN z-score \u22120.11), including the juxtaposition of the catalytic RCR motifs within the central cleft of the domain (FIG. 2c). Hickman et al. (2002) noted an acidic 38-amino acid loop between beta strand \u03b21 and alpha helix \u03b1B that was a distinctive feature of the AAV5 nuclease domain (FIG. 2c). Although the two regions only share four aligned acidic residues, the relatively large excess negative charge of the loop region is conserved among the mAAV-EVE1 and AAV5 Rep proteins.",
                                "The Superfamily 3 helicase domain fold, conserved among extant AAVs and other parvoviruses, was readily apparent within mAAV-EVE1 Rep residues 210 to 495, as were the conserved \u201cWalker motifs\u201d involved in nucleotide triphosphate binding and hydrolysis. The lysine residue of the highly conserved GKT triplet within the Walker A site was substituted with an asparagine residue in the inferred mAAVEVE1 Rep protein. There appears to be no precedent for this substitution in other Walker A site-containing nucleoside triphosphatases. Notably, amino acid substitutions at critical positions of known catalytic sites (e.g., the essential lysine residue of the Rep helicase Walker A site, the catalytic tyrosine residue of the DNA cleavage domain, and the invariant histidine residue of the VP1 phospholipase A2 domain) were observed in many of the individual mAAV-EVE1 Rep and Cap protein sequences. This pattern suggests that expression of active proteins from the endogenized viral sequence could be disadvantageous to host cell function and/or proliferation resulting in selection of function-inactivating mutations.",

The VP2-like protein is predicted to span residues 132-731 of the VP1 capsid protein and therefore comprised a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:34.",

However, when the SWISS MODEL online subroutine was used to build a VP3 3D structure model for mAAV-EVE1 with AAV2 and AAV8 as reference templates, identities of 63.9% and 65.4%, respectively, were reported. Accordingly, the AAV8-based model was used for further analysis.",
                                "As has been observed for all the other AAV structures available, the VP3 monomer contains an eight-stranded 3-barrel core (\u03b2BIDG-CHEF) and the \u03b2-strand A with variable loops (in sequence and structure) inserted between the strands and a small a-helix (\u03b1A) (FIG. 4). The placement of known regions of amino acid variability associated with surface loops (regions I through IX) were consistent with those of extant AAV capsids (FIG. 4a). These regions are located at or near the exterior surface of the VP3 monomer (FIG. 4a). Interestingly, VR-VII was substantially larger in mAAV-EVE1 compared to AAV2 and AAV8 (FIG. 3). The mAAV-EVE1 capsid, assembled from 60 copies of the VP3 common region of the VP, conserves the characteristic features of the AAVs: a depression at the icosahedral 2-fold axis, three protrusions surrounding an icosahedral 3-fold axis, a channel at the icosahedral 5-fold axis, and an HI loop (between \u03b2H and \u03b2I) lining a depression surrounding the 5-fold channel. The VRs cluster on the mAAV-EVE1 capsid surface to create local surface topology differences compared to other AAVs (FIG. 6b). For example, the larger VR-VII is located at the base of the 3-fold protrusions and extends into the depression surrounding the 5-fold channel creating a unique surface topology in mAAVEVE1. These VRs control several AAV functions, including receptor attachment, trafficking phenotypes, transduction efficiency, and antigenic reactivity (Parrish 2010. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 343:149-176; Halder et al. 2012. Future Virol 7:253-278).",

Briefly, the cassette is pre-wet in the buffer for at least 2 min, with foam float and rAAV is added to the cassette with 1 mL pipette using the pipette port. The rAAV is dialysed in PBS for 2 hrs or overnight, then in fresh PBS for 2 hrs. A third dialysis for 2 hrs in PBS/5% sorbitol is performed before the rAAV is removed from the cassette using a syringe. The virus is filtered through a 0.22-m syringe filter into a 15-ml Falcon tube or 5-mL Eppendorf tube and stores at \u221280\u00b0 C."

Briefly, a panel of human cell lines representing the broadest possible range of tissues is transduced with a vector encoding GFP and packaged using the mAAV-EVE capsid. GFP expression is then assessed by fluorescence microscopy and by FACS. For mouse cell targeting, C57BL/6 mice are injected via the tail vein with a similar vector encoding both luciferase and GFP, separated by a 2A peptide sequence. Whole-body bioluminescent imaging is used to detect luciferase expression, while specific tissues from sacrificed mice are assessed for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and FACS."
