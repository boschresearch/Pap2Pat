                        "The rise of antibiotic resistance has emphasized the need for novel antimicrobials (Levy S B et al., Nat. Med., S122-129, 2004). Although historical approaches to antibiotic discovery have yielded many crucial therapeutics, recent attempts at identifying new drugs has lagged far behind the spread of resistance. During the golden age of antibiotic discovery in the 1940s and 1950s, actinomycete extracts were screened for growth inhibition of pathogenic bacteria. This empirical platform led to identification of the major classes of antibiotics in use today. However, consistent rediscovery of established molecules led to the abandonment of empirical screening of natural products (Lewis K., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 371-387, 2013). Further, this broth-based strategy resulted in inhibitors that targeted core growth processes\u2014translation, DNA replication, and cell wall synthesis. Although highly effective, targeting essential processes leads to strong selection for resistance. In order to focus the search for antimicrobial compounds on targets less likely to lead to resistance, the field shifted toward screening of virulence-specific processes (Allen R C et al., Nat Rev. Microbiol. 300-308, 2014), aided by the advent of genomics and concomitant identification of virulence-associated targets. Some groups have sought to identify virulence inhibitors using broth conditions that mimic the host environment (Yep A et al., mBio, e01089-13-e01089-13, 2014; Hung D T et al., Science, 670-674, 2005). Pharmaceutical companies have invested in high-throughput screening of synthetic chemical libraries for inhibitory activity against validated molecular targets. Over the last 30 years, target-based approaches have yielded zero antibiotics for systemic use, due to a combination of meager hit identification from screens and a widespread lack of antibacterial activity (Lewis K., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 371-387, 2013; Payne D J et al., Nat Rev. Drug Discov., 29-40, 2007; Silver L L, Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 71-109, 2001).",
                        "The disconnect between biochemical inhibition and antibacterial activity has been attributed to poor intracellular accumulation of small molecules in bacteria (Silver L L, Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 71-109, 2001). In particular, Gram-negative bacteria contain a cell membrane, a cell wall, and an outer membrane. This cell envelope restricts penetration of amphipathic and hydrophilic substances into the cytoplasm and poses a major challenge for antibiotics (Lewis K., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 371-387, 2013; Silver L L, Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 71-109, 2001; Denyer S P et al., J. Appl. Microbiol., 92, 2002). Furthermore, bacteria that survive within host cells (e.g. Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) are additionally protected by the host cell membrane; some pathogens that survive within vesicles are also shielded by phagosomal membranes. Even traditional antibiotics useful against extracellular pathogens are thus ineffective against intracellular microbes. For instance, aminoglycosides and \u03b2-lactams poorly accumulate within host cells and are typically ineffective (Carryn S. et al., Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am., 615-634, 2003; Lamaire S. et al., J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 897-904, 2005; Tulkens P M., Eur J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis., 100-106, 1991; Maurin M et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2977-2986, 2001). Fluoroquinolones primarily localize to the host cell cytosol, and thus are less potent against pathogens within phagosomes (Carryn S. et al., Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am., 615-634, 2003; Carlier M-B et al., J. Antimicorb. Chemother., 27-39, 1990; Pechere J-C, Drugs, 29-36, 1993; Facinelli B., et al., Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect Dis., 827-833, 1997). Macrolides, although concentrated to high levels within cells, are typically ineffective against vesicular microbes due to inactivation at the low pH of phagolysosomes (Seral C. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2283,-2292, 2003; Labro M T., Clin. Microbiol. Infect., S24-S30, 1996). Similarly, hits from target-based screens typically lack antibacterial activity (Payne D J et al., Nat Rev. Drug Discov., 29-40, 2007; Silver L L, Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 71-109, 2001), as biochemical approaches inherently disregard cell permeability during initial screening. Thus, poor cell permeability represents a key pitfall for virulence-targeted antibacterials."

                        "The Gram-negative intracellular pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella) (S.Tm) causes a natural infection of mice that models the human disease typhoid fever. S.Tm survives and replicates inside macrophages in systemic sites, and resides within a specialized phagolysosomal vesicle during infection. Assay platforms can be used that utilize fluorescent S.Tm, immortalized mouse macrophages, and automated fluorescence microscopy to visualize bacterial load. A MATLAB\u00ae-based algorithm was developed to process images for high-throughput quantification. Using this platform, a 14,400-compound Maybridge Hitfinder\u2122 Collection v11 was screened. There were 309 hits identified that reduced intracellular bacterial infection with minimal host cell toxicity. The majority of the hits have not been previously identified as having antibacterial activity. Similarly, very few hits possess antibiotic activity against bacteria grown in standard microbiological media. Thus, the screen represents a powerful approach to identify antibacterial compounds within existing libraries by directly assaying bacterial infection of host cells.",
                        "Top hits were tested from the screen to determine whether any compounds inhibit bacterial efflux pumps (EPs). EPs are an attractive therapeutic target for antimicrobials and anticancer drugs, but most have proved troublesome for drug development due to toxicity issues. EPs utilize active transport to export chemicals, small molecules, and peptides. Although EPs are naturally important for defense against host-derived antimicrobials such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, many multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens have increased expression of EPs, thereby limiting antibiotic exposure. S.Tm encodes nine EPs which contribute to antibiotic efflux and also attenuate or delay virulence in vivo. In particular, the EPs encoded by the acrAB and macAB operons are both required for infection of macrophages and mice. Thus, efflux pump modulators (EPMs) have potential as therapeutics for ordinary and MDR infections by sensitizing pathogens to host defenses and clinical antibiotics. Hits from SAFIRE may represent unidentified EPMs that enhance susceptibility to host antimicrobials present within macrophages. Top hits were tested from the screen to determine whether they inhibit bacterial efflux. This resulted in characterization of three novel EPMs."

RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, a widely used cell line for bacterial infection studies, were infected with bacteria in a standard gentamicin protection assay. The Salmonella expressing GFP driven by the sifB promoter was incubated with the compound beginning at 2 hours post-infection. At 18 hours post-infection, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos as a marker of macrophage vitality and processed for fluorescence microscopy. Stained with DAPI. A MATLAB\u00ae-based algorithm was developed to quantify infection (FIG. 1B) and compared to statistics to describe infection. Percentage of infected cells was determined by counting the proportion of macrophages within an image with at least 2 GFP+ pixels. Infection area was calculated by normalizing the number of GFP+ pixels within a cell to the cell's total area, then averaging across all cells in an image. To evaluate the approach, 2 \u03bcg/ml rifampicin in 96-well and 384-well plates was tested in three independent replicates. The Z\u2032-factor was employed as a measure of assay reproducibility. Numbers close to 1 indicated high reproducibility. For percentage of infected macrophages, the Z\u2032-factor was 0.59 and 0.48 in 96-well and 384-well plates, respectively, compared with 0.66 and 0.38 for infection area. The optimal Z\u2032-factor threshold for high-throughput screening was 0.5; however, values above 0 were considered marginal but feasible. Therefore, the percentage of infected macrophages statistic was used."

The library was screened in duplicate at 25 \u03bcM in 384-well plates (FIG. 1C). Data were normalized using the B-score method to remove positional variation. The significance of B-scores was calculated using a modified t-test assuming an inverse gamma distribution of variances. Using a dual threshold of B-score greater than 1 and standard deviation from the mean and p-value less than 0.05, 908 compounds (6.3%) were identified that decreased or increased the percentage of infected macrophages. Microscopy images were manually reviewed to eliminate toxic and auto-fluorescent compounds, and the remaining positives were retested using SAFIRE in 96-well plates, which demonstrated higher Z\u2032-factors as described above (FIGS. 2A,-B). Compounds that altered infection by at least 25% in 96-well plates were considered validated hits. This analysis revealed 309 compounds (2.1%) that decreased infection and 137 (0.95%) that increased infection.",
                                "Of the 309 compounds that decreased the percentage of infected macrophages, 13 have been previously identified to have activity against microbes. In particular, amongst the compounds identified were chloramphenicol, a known antibiotic, and 9-aminoacridine, which has been used topically as an antiseptic. Other compounds identified included an inhibitor of activation of PhoP, a S.Tm virulence determinant and an inhibitor of MbtI, a siderophore biosynthesis enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Several of the other compounds have been found in high-throughput screens against microbes including hepatitis C, influenza, malaria, trypanosomes, and Candida albicans. Furthermore, 33 compounds were identified that have known activities in mammalian cells, including inhibitors of calcium channels, telomerase, TGF-beta, and NF\u03baB. To estimate the frequency of false negatives in the screen, drugs and substances were catalogued in the Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 v11 library using the Chemical Structure Lookup Service from the CADD Group Chemoinformatics Tools and User Services (see: Table 1).",
                                "There were two drugs with antibiotic activity present in the library that were not found in the screen: 6-aminopenicillinate and nalidixic acid. The screening data was re-examined to investigate why these antibiotics were not identified. 6-aminopenicillinate is a synthetic precursor to the beta-lactam antibiotics, and showed modest activity in the screen. Although the average B-score for 6-aminopenicillinate from the screen (\u22122.29) was beyond the threshold (\u22122.17), the p-value (0.056) was just above the threshold (0.05), suggesting that the use of a dual threshold increased selectivity for highly active and reproducible compounds. Nalidixic acid is a synthetic quinolone and displayed substantial activity in the first replicate of the screen (B-score \u22124.41), but was inactive in the second replicate (B-score 0.70). The original screening plate well was subsequently, which again showed minimal activity; further experiments suggested that nalidixic acid is sensitive to freeze-thawing when dissolved in DMSO (FIG. 3).",
                                "To further categorize our hit compounds, 296 was re-tested for anti-S.Tm activity using gentamicin protection assays and plating for colony forming units (CFUs). Macrophages were infected in 96-well plates and treated with 25 \u03bcM compound. At 18 hours post-infection, macrophages were lysed to release intracellular bacteria and lysates were diluted and plated to determine CFUs. Although known bacteriostatic antibiotics such as rifampicin, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin show similar inhibition by the CFU assay as by SAFIRE, only half of the hits displayed significant (>25%) inhibition by the CFU plating (FIG. 4). However, 64 of the top 75 compounds as ranked by SAFIRE exhibited significant activity by the CFU assay, suggesting that most highly active compounds are robust in both assays."

                                "Efflux pumps (EPs) represent a key pathogen virulence strategy to protect against host antimicrobials as well as therapeutic antibiotics. Furthermore, efflux pump modulators (EPMs) typically demonstrate high MICs as single agents, similar to our hits (FIG. 2C). Thus, EPMs may have been identified by our screen due to cooperation with host antimicrobials. To uncover putative EPMs within our collection of hits, 58 repurchased compounds were screened in a Hoechst accumulation assay. Bacteria were incubated with Hoechst 33342, a dye which fluoresces when bound to DNA. Heat-killed bacteria exhibited very high fluorescence immediately after exposure to the dye, as all DNA was bound by Hoechst (FIG. 5A, open circles; FIG. 5B, white). After 60 minutes of exposure, wild-type S.Tm exhibited low fluorescence, likely because Hoechst is effluxed before it binds DNA. Hoechst accumulation increased in a strain lacking the AcrAB efflux pump (FIG. 5, black vs. gray) and a wild-type strain incubated with EPM Phe-Arg \u03b8-naphthylamide (PA\u03b2N) (FIG. 5A). Three of the top 58 compounds also increased S.Tm accumulation of Hoechst in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 5A, red (EPM30), green (EPM35), blue (EPM43), with EC50s lower than that of PA\u03b2N (FIG. 6).",
                                "Because Hoechst and other dyes commonly used to assess efflux bind cellular components, direct measurement of efflux is not possible using these methods; instead, the Hoechst assay measures dye accumulation, the net result of entry and efflux. Further, the slow off-rate of Hoechst entails that efflux pumps have no effect on dye already bound to DNA. As a result, compounds which increase Hoechst accumulation may actually enhance dye entry by altering porins or disrupting the membrane. To more specifically measure efflux pump activity, a second technique was employed using the dye Nile Red, a lipophilic membrane-partitioning dye which fluoresces in nonpolar environments. Because Nile Red is not known to bind cellular components, to directly observe efflux cells were preloaded with the dye in the absence of glucose to reduce efflux pump activity (FIG. 7A). Upon addition of glucose, bacteria rapidly effluxed Nile Red and fluorescence returned to baseline levels (FIG. 7B, top panel). Treatment with 500 \u03bcM PA\u03b2N inhibited glucose-activated efflux (FIG. 7B, second panel). The initial measured fluorescence was lower for DMSO-treated cells (upper dotted line) than for PA\u03b2N-treated cells due to glucose-independent efflux during sample preparation (FIG. 8A). Next, it was determined whether efflux pump activity is restored after removal of PA\u03b2N. Bacteria were incubated with compound for 15 minutes, pelleted and resuspended in buffer lacking compound, and then stimulated with glucose (FIGS. 7C, 7E). Washout of PA\u03b2N partially restored the ability of S.Tm to efflux Nile Red upon glucose addition, which is consistent with PA\u03b2N specifically binding efflux pumps during short incubations rather than disrupting the outer membrane. Nile Red fluorescence was quantified at 7 minutes post-glucose addition for several doses of PA\u03b2N and observed dose dependent inhibition of Nile Red efflux (FIGS. 7D, 7E).",
                                "Next, it was determined whether the EPMs inhibit glucose-activated efflux of Nile Red (FIGS. 7B, 7D). Treatment with all three EPMs inhibited Nile Red efflux in a dose-dependent manner, as observed for PA\u03b2N. At the highest concentrations tested (FIG. 7B), EPM30 (75 \u03bcM) and EPM35 (100 \u03bcM) fully inhibited efflux, but EPM43 (100 \u03bcM) only partially inhibited efflux, suggesting that EPM30 and EPM35 may be more potent. Next it was determined whether efflux pump activity is restored after removal of the compound (FIG. 7C, 7E). Washout of EPM30 partially restored efflux, similar to washout of PA\u03b2N, suggesting EPM30 may reversibly bind efflux pump components. However, cells treated with EPM35 remained unable to efflux even after removal of the drug, implying that this drug may tightly bind its target or cause degradation of its target. Cells treated with EPM43 partially effluxed Nile Red after compound washout; this efflux was similar to efflux in the presence of compound, indicating that the partial inhibition by EPM43 at this concentration was maintained even after removal of the drug. Overall, these data suggest the EPMs may employ unique modes of efflux inhibition and may target unique biochemical pathways."

                                "One way to inhibit efflux pumps is to disrupt the proton motive force, which is required for transport by some EPs. The EPM30, EPM35, and EPM43 compounds were tested to determine whether they alter proton motive force by monitoring the ability of S.Tm to swim in soft agar plates overnight. Bacteria were injected into the center of 0.25% agar plates, and 10 \u03bcl of compound was added to paper disks on the periphery. The bacteria avoided swimming towards the known protonophore CCCP, creating a halo around CCCP spotted at 50\u00d7 the MIC (6.25 mM) (FIG. 9A). Since this assay requires an intact proton gradient and bacterial growth, bacteriostatic antibiotics not thought to disrupt the proton motive force, were tested to determine if they resulted in a halo. It was found that ciprofloxacin at 400\u00d7 the MIC (4 \u03bcM) formed a halo similar in size to that of CCCP (FIG. 9B). Also ampicillin and rifampicin were tested. We plotted the halo radius versus the concentration as the fold above the MIC (FIG. 9G). All three antibiotics converged (black line), whereas a series of CCCP concentrations was shifted to the left and up. Next, it was determined whether PA\u03b2N inhibited swimming; PA\u03b2N is thought to disrupt membranes over long incubations. PA\u03b2N at only 6.25\u00d7 the MIC (12.5 mM) was required to form a similar sized halo, (FIG. 9C), and PA\u03b2N, similar to CCCP, was shifted to the left (FIG. 9H), which suggests that PA\u03b2N inhibits overnight swimming by disrupting the membrane potential. These data suggest that compounds which inhibit growth inhibit swimming at higher concentrations relative to their MIC than compounds which disrupt proton motive force. Finally, the EPMs at 50 mM were tested (FIGS. 9D-F). EPM30 formed a halo. The concentration tested is 500\u00d7 the MIC, so it was concluded that EPM30 likely prevented swimming by inhibiting growth, similar to ciprofloxacin. EPM35 formed a small halo; the concentration tested is 125\u00d7 the MIC. EPM43 formed no halo, even though the concentration is \u02dc62.5\u00d7 the MIC. That EPMs only form halos at concentrations much higher than their MICs (or we are limited by solubility) suggests that the haloes formed by the EPMs are due to growth inhibition."

All three compounds showed greater than 97% inhibition of S.Tm in macrophages in the initial SAFIRE screen, single-digit micromolar IC50s, and reduction of at least 98% of bacteria in CFU plating assays (FIG. 2B, FIG. 6). The compounds also had low activity against S.Tm grown in broth, which is consistent with their activity as EPMs. As described above, the EPMs demonstrated lower EC50s in the Hoechst assay compared to PA\u03b2N. Next, the in vitro toxicity of the EPMs was investigated using the LDH assay in the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2, which predicts toxicity and metabolism of drugs by the liver. All three compounds displayed moderate toxicity in HepG2 LDH assays, although higher than the IC50s against intracellular S.Tm in RAWs, suggesting the presence of a therapeutic window below host toxicity. Further, optimization of the structure by medicinal chemistry may yield less toxic molecules. Log D describes the lipophilicity of a compound, and corresponds with its ability to permeate biological membranes; typically a log D below 3 is desirable for a drug. Together, log D and solubility indicate a compound's likely bioavailability, which impacts the utility as a therapeutic. All three EPMs have log D around 3 and poor solubility, leading to low predicted bioavailability; optimization of the chemical structures may lead to compounds that have potential as a biological probe or drug.",
                                "All three EPMs are structurally distinct from each other and from EPM PA\u03b2N, which is a naphthyl peptidomimetic (FIG. 6). EPM30 is a small compound with an aminothiazole core, which is amenable to synthetic modification. Several aminothiazole compounds have been identified that inhibit efflux, although EPM30 is smaller than these molecules. Aminothiazoles often have adequate cellular permeability to be active against intracellular microbes. The next EPM identified was EPM35, a trifluoro-pyrimidine linked to a piperidine. Excitingly, a very similar compound was identified by an in silico screen of the Maybridge library for binding to AcrB, the active component of a key efflux pump in S.Tm. The EPM35-similar compound occupies the substrate-binding pocket of AcrB, and likely spans a large portion of the pocket, as do other inhibitors that target AcrB. Finally, the third compound, EPM43, is a small quinazoline, a planar moiety which is a common drug pharmacophore. Other quinazolines have been identified as inhibitors of bacterial and fungal EPs. Interestingly, EPM43 itself has previously been identified as an inhibitor of fungal dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) though not the human enzyme. It is possible that this compound inhibits bacterial DHFR. If so, it seems likely that this activity might be independent of efflux inhibition, because there is no known connection between DHFR and bacterial efflux. EPM43 is less toxic to HepG2 cells than the other EPMs, but demonstrates poor aqueous solubility. Overall, the three EPMs represent three unique scaffolds amenable to medicinal chemistry."

                                "Next, it was investigated how EPMs might lead to bacterial clearance within host cells. Because efflux pumps are not essential for S.Tm growth in broth and the three EPMs exhibited high MICs, it was unlikely that EPMs independently cause bacterial death. Instead, EPMs may synergize with a host antimicrobial(s) that is effluxed by EPs. Two S.Tm EPs are necessary for infection of macrophages and mice (FIG. 10). The first EP, MacAB, is important for defense against ROS. The second S.Tm EP, AcrAB, is a homolog of MtrCDE, an EP in Neisseria gonorrhoeae which exports host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AcrAB thus likely exports AMPs as well as a variety of other substrates including antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. To test whether the EPMs synergize with macrophage defenses, wild-type bacteria was exposed in broth to ROS or AMPs in the presence of EPMs. The EPMs had no effect on bacterial growth in 0.2 mM H2O2, suggesting they do not synergize with ROS (FIG. 11). Next, the two AMPs were tested: polymyxin B is a model peptide produced by bacteria; LL-37 is a human cathelicidin produced by macrophages. Bacteria treated with 5 \u03bcg/ml AMP (\u215b MIC) or 25 \u03bcM EPM exhibited mild to no growth inhibition. However, combination treatment significantly inhibited growth; similar results were obtained with 500 \u03bcM PA\u03b2N (FIG. 12). Interestingly, co-treatment with EPMs and the human AMP LL-37 caused varying levels of growth inhibition, suggesting that polymyxin B and LL-37 may employ different mechanisms of action. However, co-treatment with polymyxin B and either EPM35 or EPM43 completely inhibited growth, indicating that the EPMs can synergize with AMPs.",
                                "Although AMPs such as LL-37 and \u03b2-defensin 2 are upregulated in response to infection, AMPs such as LL-37, \u03b1-defensin, \u03b2-defensin 1, and angiogenin are also basally expressed and stored in azurophilic granules. Therefore, the question was whether the EPMs require host transcription or translation of AMPs or other factors, for antimicrobial activity. SAFIRE was performed in the presence of a transcriptional (DRB) or translational (cycloheximide) inhibitor (FIG. 13). Since exposure to inhibitors prior to infection greatly diminished macrophage viability, DRB or cycloheximide was added 2 hours post-infection, concurrently with EPMs. This procedure should prevent late induction of host defense genes, and, indeed, there was no observance of increased macrophage expression of Slc6A4 (5-HTT) and Camp, two genes induced in macrophages late (FIG. 13B). While treatment with DRB or cyclohexamide decreased basal infection (FIG. 14), antibacterial activity of the EPMs did not change (FIG. 13A). These data suggest that macrophage defenses induced more than 2 hours after infection do not contribute to EPM antibacterial activity. Instead, one or more of the many host defenses that are induced early 110] may synergize with EPMs.",
                                "Next, whether EPMs may inhibit S.Tm growth in non-immune cells was analyzed. AMPs are expressed by multiple cell types, including diverse epithelial cells. Thus, whether EPMs inhibit S.Tm growth in HeLa cells was tested. HeLa cells express AMPs and are a model of epithelial cell infection. First, Eps were tested to determine if they are relevant for infection of HeLa cells. Deletion of acrAB but not macAB reduced bacterial colonization (FIG. 15A). Next HeLa cells were infected with S.Tm expressing GFP from the rpsM locus and monitored for bacterial infection with SAFIRE after treatment with the three EPMs (FIG. 15B, 15C). Treatment with EPM30 and EPM35 appeared to decrease MitoTracker signal in HeLa cells, which agrees with the results from the LDH assay (FIG. 9) and macrophage screening (FIG. 2B). However, all three EPMs decreased bacterial load in HeLa cells at 25 \u03bcM. EPM treatment of infected HeLa cells did not lead to complete absence of bacteria as observed during treatment of infected RAWs (FIG. 2B). Instead, we observed isolated intact bacteria. This may suggest that HeLa cells do not degrade dead bacteria as quickly as macrophages, or that EPMs primarily arrest bacterial growth in HeLas, or this effect may be due to differences in GFP expression by S.Tm. Overall, these data indicate the EPMs may be active against infections of diverse cell types, including non-immune cells."

                                "Increased expression or function of efflux pumps often contributes to clinical multidrug resistance. Therefore, whether the EPMs re-sensitize two multidrug resistant strains of S.Tm to tetracycline was tested. Tetracycline is an antibiotic exported by AcrAB. The MAR1 strain is derived from wild-type SL1344 was selected by exposure to tetracycline, and has increased expression of the AcrAB efflux pump. 510801 is an MDR strain isolated from the mesenteric lymph node of a septic calf and is resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, and triple sulfa. The basis of multi-drug resistance in this strain is unknown. MARL has a 2-fold increase in MIC (4 \u03bcg/ml) over isogenic wild-type S.Tm (2 \u03bcg/ml). S10801 has a 64-fold increase in tetracycline MIC (128 \u03bcg/ml) over wild type. It was found that EPM35 increased sensitivity to tetracycline, but not EPM30 or EPM43, suggesting these compounds have an alternative target. Treatment of both strains with 250 \u03bcM PA\u03b2N (\u215b MIC) or 50 \u03bcM EPM35 (\u215b MIC) decreased the tetracycline MIC 4-fold (FIG. 16A). In addition, the effect of these concentrations on the sensitivity of wild type S.Tm was tested, which showed similar reductions in MIC as with the MDR strains (FIG. 16A). To expand these results, checkerboard assays were performed with all three strains (FIG. 16B), which showed comparable reductions in MIC for different combinations of tetracycline and EPM35 or PA\u03b2N. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) was calculated for each pair and identified combinations where the FICI was below 0.5, suggesting synergistic interactions between tetracycline and the EPMs.",
                                "Finally, whether EPM35 increased sensitivity of 510801 and wild-type S.Tm to tetracycline in vivo was tested. 7-week-old C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1\u00d7104 bacteria. At 30 minutes and 24 hours post-infection, 25 mg/kg tetracycline and 50 mg/kg EPM35 was injected. Distress was observed in mice treated with EPM35 including squinty eyes and hunching posture, as well as neurological abnormalities in one mouse (loss of coordination, tail stiffening). Thus, the experiment was ended at 30 hours post-infection; the spleen and liver were harvested and plated to determine bacterial CFU. S10801-infected mice injected with tetracycline alone had lower levels of bacteria, but co-treatment with EPM35 appeared to further reduce bacterial CFU (FIG. 16C). This enhanced decrease was not observed in mice infected with wild-type bacteria, suggesting this combinatorial effect may be specific against MDR bacteria. Due to the signs of distress observed in mice treated with EPM35, the experiment was not repeated."

                                "SAFIRE has the potential to identify EPMs because Salmonella requires at least two efflux pumps, AcrAB and MacAB, to replicate and/or survive within macrophages and mice. The fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 is an efflux pump substrate, and increased Hoechst accumulation relative to controls identifies potential modulators of efflux pumps. Bacteria was incubated with each of the 58 repurchased, validated hits and Hoechst 33342. As expected, heat-killed bacteria exhibited high fluorescence immediately after exposure to Hoechst because an electrochemical gradient is required to export pump substrates. Live, wild-type Salmonella demonstrated low fluorescence, and a strain lacking the AcrAB efflux pump had a modest level of fluorescence. Pa\u03b2N treatment resulted in higher levels of fluorescence. Under the same conditions, treatment with three of the 58 compounds (EPM30, EPM35 and EPM43) resulted in fluorescence comparable to that of PA\u03b2N (FIG. 17A). Further examination revealed that the three compounds had effective concentration-50s (EC50s) four-fold lower than that of PA\u03b2N in the Hoechst assay (FIG. 17B). The chemical structures of the three compounds do not resemble known efflux pump inhibitors (FIG. 17C). Finally, since the cell culture assays use gentamicin to prevent the replication of extracellular Salmonella, it was established that the three compounds do not synergize with the antibacterial activity of gentamicin in broth (FIG. 4). Altogether, the data suggested that the putative EPMs merit further study.",

                                "A more thorough characterization was performed of the putative EPMs regarding anti Salmonella activity in multiple mammalian cell types. Micrographs from RAW264.7 macrophages treated with 25 \u03bcM of each compound demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial GFP signal compared to treatment with vehicle alone (FIG. 5A). The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) for the three compounds in macrophages ranged from 3 to 7 \u03bcM (FIG. 18A). HeLa cells harboring a Salmonella-165 GFP reporter strain and treated with 25 \u03bcM of each compound also demonstrated a reduction in bacterial GFP signal compared to treatment with vehicle alone (FIGS. 5C, 18B). To establish whether reduced GFP signal correlates with bacterial killing, we quantified bacterial survival by enumerating CFU from infected cells. RAW264.7 macrophages treated with the putative EPMs reduced the number of recoverable Salmonella 100-1,000-fold, compared to treatment with vehicle or PA\u03b2N (FIG. 18D). In primary bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages (BMDMs) all three hit compounds reduced the number of recoverable Salmonella (SL1344) by approximately 20-fold (FIG. 18C). Thus, the putative EPMs inhibit bacterial replication and/or survival in multiple cell types relevant to whole animal infection.",

                                "Clinical MDR isolates frequently express high levels of efflux pumps (1). Salmonella encode at least two efflux pumps needed for bacterial survival in cells, AcrAB and MacAB. Both of these pumps use the TolC channel to transport cargo across the outer membrane. The importance of the acrAB, macAB and to/C genes for bacterial replication and/or survival was confirmed in macrophages (FIG. 18D). A laboratory isolate of Salmonella (SL1344), MAR1, was selected for resistance to tetracycline and is also resistant to other antibiotics based on a mutation that increases expression of the AcrAB efflux pump (27). Treatment of macrophages with any of the three putative EPMs [25 \u03bcM] was found to not significantly reduce the load of the MARL strain compared to treatment with DMSO (FIG. 18E). However, a clinical MDR Salmonella isolate (S10801) was recovered from macrophages at levels at 188 least 100-fold lower upon EPM treatment compared to DMSO or PA\u03b2N (FIG. 18F), indicating that the hit compounds inhibit MDR bacteria during infection.",

                                "Having established that the putative EPMs are antimicrobial in mammalian cells, activity of the EPMs was further analyzed. While the Hoechst accumulation assay is a good first approximation of anti-efflux pump activity, quantification of export in real time based on glucose-dependence is a more specific assay for pump inhibition. Nile Red is an efflux pump substrate that becomes strongly fluorescent upon partitioning into the cytoplasmic membrane and possibly the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. Cells were preloaded with Nile Red and then treated with glucose to energize the efflux pumps and stimulate Nile Red export. Incubation with PA\u03b2N or any of the three EPMs reduced the rate and extent of Nile Red export upon glucose addition in a dose dependent manner (FIGS. 6A, 19A, 8). Washout of PA\u03b2N, EPM30 or EPM43 prior to adding glucose partially restored Nile Red export, suggesting the activity of these compounds, compared to EPM35, is readily reversible (FIG. 8). Moreover, a similar glucose-dependent assay using a different pump substrate, ethidium bromide, further demonstrated that all three EPMs reduced efflux pump export (FIG. 19B). These observations indicate that the three EPMs inhibit energy-dependent efflux pump activity.",
                                "**Example 13. Bacterial Membranes Remain Intact Upon Exposure to the Three EPMs**",
                                "Since efflux pumps rely upon the proton motive force or ATP to provide 210 the energy for the transport of substrates, chemicals that disrupt the inner membrane may indirectly inhibit efflux. To establish whether the three EPMs alter bacterial inner membrane potential, their effect on the incorporation of the voltage-sensitive dye Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) was observed. After 30 minutes of exposure to the ionophore CCCP, TMRM levels in cells were approximately 50-fold lower than upon treatment with DMSO, but treatment with any of the three EPMs did not alter TMRM signal (FIGS. 20A, 20B). These observations suggest that membrane potential remains intact in the presence of the EPMs. To establish whether a longer incubation with the EPMs may compromise membrane integrity, the effect of the EPMs on bacterial swimming, an energy intensive activity was monitored over 15 hours (FIGS. 20C, 10). Bacteria were injected into the center of soft-agar plates and 10 \u03bcl of compound was pipetted onto paper disks on the periphery (41). Control compounds included CCCP and PA\u03b2N, which disrupts membranes over long (>30 minutes) exposures. Since swimming overnight also requires bacterial growth, we tested whether filters containing bacteriostatic antibiotics prevented swimming beyond growth inhibition. Neither the three EPMs nor the conventional antibiotics inhibited swimming relative to their MIC, as compared to CCCP and PA\u03b2N, further suggesting that the EPMs do not interfere with bacterial energy production across the inner membrane.",
                                "A second class of chemicals that appears to interfere with bacterial efflux does so by permeabilizing the outer membrane, which allows substrates to diffuse into the periplasm. Therefore the EPMs were tested to determine whether they enable the chromogenic beta-lactam nitrocefin to access the periplasm and be hydrolyzed 233 by beta-lactamase. Compared to control compounds PA\u03b2N or polymyxin B, a pore-forming antimicrobial peptide, the EPMs did not increase nitrocefin permeation of the outer membrane (FIG. 20D), suggesting they do not disrupt efflux by increasing bacterial outer membrane permeability.",

                                "To establish whether the hit compounds have minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in broth that are similar to their IC50S in host cells (see: FIG. 18), bacterial growth was examined in their presence using standard rich laboratory media, Mueller Hinton Broth. The MICs of EPM30, EPM35, and EPM43 respectively were 100 \u03bcM (\u03bcg/mL), 400 \u03bcM (186 \u03bcg/mL), and >400 \u03bcM (113 \u03bcg/mL), for three Salmonella strains: the strain used in the SAFIRE screen (SL1344), a tetracycline-resistant derivative of SL1344 with demonstrated increased production of AcrAB (MAR1), and a clinical MDR Salmonella isolate (S10801). These MIC values are considerably higher than the IC50S observed in host cells and higher than MICs observed for traditional antibiotics, which are usually in the 1-10 \u03bcg/mL range. Thus, the three putative EPMs may not function like traditional antibiotics and yet are potent in the context of the host cell.",

                                "Next, it was determined why the EPMs kill bacteria in mammalian cells at 10-fold or more lower concentrations than they inhibit efflux in broth. One possibility is that the presence of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) within host cells plays a role. Mammalian cells constitutively express AMPs and increase AMP expression in response to infection. It was found that in broth the combination of each EPM with either the bacterial derived polymyxin B or the human cathelicidin AMP LL37, but not individual treatments, significantly inhibited Salmonella growth (FIG. 7). These data suggest at least three possibilities: EPMs may potentiate AMP activity, AMPs may potentiate EPM activity, or both.",
                                "To distinguish between these possibilities, it was first determined that bacterial exposure to polymyxin B concentrations high enough to allow nitrocefin access to the periplasm (5 \u03bcg/mL, FIGS. 20D, 20E) did not enhance the ability of the EPMs to increase Hoechst accumulation (FIG. 14). Similarly, cotreatment of polymyxin B with EPMs did not synergistically increase Nile Red retention compared to polymyxin B or EPMs alone (FIG. 14). These observations suggest that the membrane-damaging activity of polymyxin B did not potentiate EPM blockage of efflux pumps. Next, it was observed that low concentrations of polymyxin B (1 \u03bcg/mL), which do not by themselves allow nitrocefin access to the periplasm (FIGS. 20D, 20E), did indeed increase the rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis in the presence of EPMs (25 \u03bcM) (FIG. 21). It thus appears that EPMs potentiate AMPs with regard to both nitrocefin entry into the periplasm and bacterial growth inhibition. Therefore, EPMs may decrease the effective concentration of AMPs and, for this reason, have indirect antibacterial activity in the context of the host.",

Melting curve analysis of the PCR reaction showed a single amplicon for each target. No-template and no-reverse-transcriptase controls showed no product. Amplification results were baseline corrected, followed by manual determination of the threshold for each gene. The resulting CT values were analyzed as follows: (i) The mean CT of qPCR technical duplicates was determined for each sample. (ii) Sert and Camp expression for each sample was normalized to that of Hprt, resulting in the \u0394CT. (iii) Each sample was normalized to the mean of the uninfected samples for that experiment, resulting in the \u0394\u0394CT for that sample.

                                "High magnification images were acquired on an Olympus IX81 inverted widefield microscope. For screening imaging, three-color images were acquired at 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 on a Cellomics ArrayScan VTI (Thermo) and exported to DIB files. At least two images were taken per well for all experiments. We developed an automated MATLAB\u00ae script to quantify intracellular bacterial load; scripting packages have been deposited on MATLAB\u00ae File Exchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/), deposited as \u201cSAFIRE_ArrayScan\u201d and \u201cSAFIRE_OlympusIX81.\u201d. Briefly, the algorithm identifies macrophage borders via watershed segmentation using DAPI and MitoTracker signal. In order to identify bacteria, the user supplies an empirically determined GFP threshold that maximizes signal to noise. Within each macrophage, the number of pixels above the GFP threshold is counted. If more than 2 pixels are above the GFP threshold, the macrophage is labeled infected. The script calculates the percentage of macrophages infected in the image. To determine infection area for each cell, the number of GFP+ positive pixels was divided by the number of total pixels in the cell. Average infection area was determined by averaging across all cells within the image. Raw data for at least 2 images from the same well are averaged to yield one value for each well. Raw screening data was subjected to B-score normalization because we identified significant row and column effects by the method described in the literature. To determine significance of screening data, we employed the modified one-sample t-test by fitting the variances of replicates to an inverse gamma distribution. Assay positives were defined as having a p-value less than 0.05 and a B-score outside one standard deviation from the mean."
