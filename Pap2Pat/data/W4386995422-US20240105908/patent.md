# DESCRIPTION

## STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

## FIELD

The present invention relates generally to the field of lithium rechargeable batteries. More particularly, it relates to processes for modifying surface chemistry of a cathode material, as well as the resulting cathode materials and uses thereof.

## BACKGROUND

Lithium-ion batteries are a class of electrochemical cells composing of an anode, a cathode, and a non-aqueous electrolyte and separator sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. During charging process, lithium ions are removed from the cathode, diffuse through the non-aqueous electrolyte, and then insert into the anode. The reverse process occurs during the discharging process. Exemplary anode material for lithium-ion batteries includes, but is not limited to, mesocarbon microbeads, natural graphite, synthetic graphite, soft carbon, hard carbon, and Si-based alloys. Exemplary cathode material includes, but is not limited to, LiFePO4, LiFexMn1-xPO4 (0≤x≤1), and LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤x+y≤1). For example, a cathode electrode can be fabricated by: mixing the cathode material, carbon black conducting filler, and a polymeric binder such as poly(vinylene difluoride) (PVDF) in an organic solvent (e.g., n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) to form a viscous slurry; casting the slurry on a current collector, such as aluminum foil; and drying the wet film at an elevated temperature to obtain the final cathode electrode.

Being the dominant cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤x+y≤1) is generally synthesized through a solid-state reaction process by sintering the mixture of a transition metal precursor and a lithium source, such as LiOH, LiOH·H2O, or Li2CO3, at a relatively high temperature. Consequently, a small amount of LiOH/Li2CO3 usually deposits on the surface of the final cathode material as a basic impurity. More Li2CO3 can be generated when exposing LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤x+y≤1) cathode material to ambient conditions during storage. The presence of an excess amount of basic impurity can create a basic environment when preparing the cathode slurry, and potentially trigger the crosslinking reaction of PVDF, leading to the gelation of the slurry and the reduction on the mechanical stability of the final cathode electrode (see J. Electrochem. Soc., 150(8): A1073-A1078, 2003). Moreover, the presence of Li2CO3 in cathode can also accelerate the parasitic reactions between the cathode electrode and the non-aqueous electrolyte (see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 139(49): 17853-17860, 2017), resulting in an accelerated performance loss of lithium-ion cells. Therefore, there is technological need to actively mitigate the impact of the basic impurities on the surface of cathode materials.

### The Present Technology

In particular, the methods described herein can convert basic impurities on the surface of cathode materials into a beneficial coating layer, which can enhance the electrochemical performance of the cathode materials.

Reagents and General Methods.

The electrochemical properties were tested in coin-type 2032R cells with lithium metal as a counter electrode. A slurry composing of active cathode material, conductive additive (Carbon45), and binder (polyvinylidene-fluoride, PVDF) were prepared using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent, with a mass ratio of 92:4:4 (cathode/binder/conductive additive). The obtained slurry was applied onto an Al current collector, dried, and then punched into 14 mm diameter disks with cathode loading level of 9-10 mg cm−2. The electrolyte consisting of 1.2M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate solution (EC:EMC=3:7 by wt.) was used. The half coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box, each coin cell consisted of a cathode electrode and a Li chip anode electrode with a layer of separators in between.

Galvanostatic cycle tests were performed in voltage range from 2.5 to 4.4 V (vs Li+/Li), with a constant current of C/3.

### Example 7

Identifying Li3PO4 and AlPO4. The presence of Li3PO4 and/or AlPO4 in the surface modified cathode active material (LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 treated with a 5 wt % Al(H2PO4)3 solution) was characterized using XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and SEM/EDS (scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)). Results are shown in FIGS. 7-9.

The presence of Al—O and P—O bond (from Al3PO4 and/or Li3PO4) in a surface modified cathode active material was demonstrated by XPS characterization (FIGS. 7a-7b), whereas Al or P signal was not observed in samples without surface modification (FIGS. 7c-7d). The Al2O3+x peak could be due to the less of PO4. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 8, the surface modified cathode active material has a Li2CO3/Ni peak area ratio of 0.03, whereas the cathode active material without surface modification has a Li2CO3/Ni peak area ratio of 0.24, indicating the Li2CO3 has been significantly reduced after surface modification

The presence of Al and P in a surface modified cathode active material was also demonstrated by SEM/EDS (FIGS. 9a-9c), confirming the formation of Al-based and P-based species after converting Li2CO3 impurity to coatings on the sample. Additionally, “surface coating” of a cathode active material with an Al-based and P-based species was achieved using the present technology. Moreover, the dispersion of P was different from that of Al, and local accumulation of P was observed, suggesting that the P-based species formed in the sample was not completely identical to the Al-based species.

### Example 8

Impact of interfacial properties. Li2CO3 impurity on NMC cathode plays a key role in parasitic reactions, converting the Li2CO3 impurity to a beneficial coating layer significantly influence interface performance by decreasing parasitic reactions between Li2CO3 impurity and electrolyte. Furthermore, the surface coating/modification can prevent the cathode materials from having direct contact with the electrolyte and to avoid decomposition or oxidation of electrolyte to protect the cathode material

Surface Modification Suppressed the Hike of Interfacial Impedance.

Properties of the pristine sample (LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2), and the surface modified cathode active material (LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 treated with a 1 wt % and 5 wt % Al(H2PO4)3 solution) were compared.

FIG. 10 shows the evolution of the EIS spectra/impedance for pristine sample (LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2), and the surface modified cathode active material (LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 treated with a 1 wt % and 5 wt % Al(H2PO4)3 solution) after 50 cycles. FIG. 10 (a) shows the three samples' voltage profile during in situ EIS test. FIG. 10 (b) demonstrated the fitting results of the impedance at 4.4V of the three samples using the corresponded circuit diagram. FIG. 10 (c, d, e) shows the in situ impedance towards/against the voltage. FIG. 10 (c) is the R1 circuit diagram, which represent coin half cell series resistance, all 3 samples are small, indicating all cells are good and likely not impactful to performance. R2 in FIG. 10 (d) is the interfacial resistance, the 1 wt % Al(H2PO4)3-processed sample showed the lowest R2, which likely means the beneficial coating layer is more conductive and has less resistance. R3 in FIG. 10 (e) is the charge transfer resistance, 1 wt % Al(H2PO4)3 processed sample showed the lowest R3, especially at 4.4V, the cell working voltage, indicate 1 wt % Al(H2PO4)3-processed sample has the lowest inactivate surface phases like rock salt, which suppressed the hike of interfacial impedance.
