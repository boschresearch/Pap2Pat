# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- define technical field

## BACKGROUND

- motivate density analysis

## SUMMARY

- summarize magnetic levitation method

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce magnetic levitation for density determination
- describe forensic investigations and trace object analysis
- explain density measurement using magnetic levitation
- discuss choice of analytes, including glitter and smokeless gunpowder
- describe characteristics of glitter and its potential as associative evidence
- discuss other applications of density determination, including bone, ivory, and wood
- illustrate magnetic levitation device and its operation
- discuss sample preparation and potential issues, such as impurities and gas bubbles
- outline importance of careful preparation and analysis in forensic science

### Example 1

- measure density of glitter samples using magnetic levitation

### Example 2

- demonstrate removal of nail polish from glitter sample without altering its density

### Example 3

- investigate effect of air bubbles on density measurement accuracy

### Example 4

- determine density of smokeless gunpowder samples using magnetic levitation

### Example 5

- demonstrate density-based separation
