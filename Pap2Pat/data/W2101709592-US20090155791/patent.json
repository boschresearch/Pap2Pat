The methods and compositions employs a novel design of primers. CpG-containing methylation-independent oligonucleotide primers, wherein both unmethylated and methylated alleles of a CpG-containing nucleic acid can be detected by use of only one set of primers after the CpG-containing nucleic acid has been subjected to cytosine to thymine conversion of unmethylated Cytosine.

The relationship between improved prognosis and stage of disease at diagnosis hold across all forms of cancer for the most part. Therefore, there is an important need to develop early assays of general tumorigenesis through marker assays that measure general tumorigenesis without regard to the tissue source or cell type that is the source of a primary tumor. Moreover, there is a need to address distinct genetic alteration patterns that can serve as a platform associated with general tumorigenesis for early detection and prognostic monitoring of many forms of cancer."

                                "Methylation of DNA is a mechanism for changing the sequence of DNA without altering its coding function. DNA methylation is a heritable, reversible and epigenetic change. DNA methylation harbours the potential to alter gene expression which in turn affects developmental and genetic processes. The methylation reaction involves flipping a target cytosine out of an intact double helix thereby allowing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine in a cleft of the enzyme DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (Klimasauskas et al., Cell 76:357-369, 1994) to form 5-methylcytosine (5-mCyt). This enzymatic conversion is the only epigenetic modification of DNA known to exist in vertebrates and is essential for normal embryonic development (Bird, Cell 70:5-8, 1992; Laird and Jaenisch, Human Mol. Genet. 3:1487-1495, 1994; and Bestor and Jaenisch, Cell 69:915-926, 1992).",
                                "CpG-rich sequences are known as CpG islands (1). CpG islands are distributed across the human genome and often span the promoter region as well as the first exon of protein coding genes. Methylation of individual promoter region CpG islands usually turns off or reduce the rate of transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases, which supports the formation of inactive chromatin (2). CpG islands are typically between 0.2 to about 1 kb in length and are located upstream of many housekeeping and tissue-specific genes, but may also extend into gene coding regions. Therefore, it is the methylation of cytosine residues within CpG islands in somatic tissues, which is believed to affect gene function by altering transcription (Cedar, Cell 53:3-4, 1988).",
                                "Abnormal methylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes may also cause decreased gene expression. Increased methylation of such regions may lead to progressive reduction of normal gene expression giving abnormal cells a growth advantage (i.e., a malignancy).",
                                "Methylation promoter regions, particularly in tumour suppressor genes, and genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair, is one of the hallmarks of cancer (2). Changes in the methylation status of these genes are an early event in cancer and continue throughout the different stages of the cancer. Specifically, distinct tumour types often have characteristic patterns of methylation, which can be used as markers for early detection and/or monitoring the progression of carcinogenesis (3, 4). For therapeutic purposes, the methylation of certain genes, particularly DNA repair genes, can cause sensitivity to specific chemotherapeutics and methylation of those genes can thereby act as a predictive marker if those chemotherapeutic agents are used (5).",
                                "A number of current methodologies for methylation studies already exist (9). Sequencing of bisulphite-treated DNA is the gold standard for methylation studies as it reveals directly the status of each CpG dinucleotide. The technique is, however, both time consuming and cost inefficient, and therefore not immediately applicable for large scale analysis such as screening programmes.",
                                "Another technique is the methylation specific PCR (MSP) (21). U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,146 discloses a method of methylation specific PCR (MSP) for identifying DNA methylation patterns in a CpG containing nucleic acid. The method uses agents to modify unmethylated cytosine in the nucleic acid. CpG specific oligonucleotide primers are used to distinguish between modified methylated and unmethylated nucleic acid. The identification of the methylated nucleic acid is based on the presence or absence of amplification product resulting from the amplification and distinguishing modified methylated and non-methylated nucleic acids. However, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is prone to false positive results and may result in overestimation of the number of methylated samples. Furthermore, MSP mainly offers a qualitative result of the methylation status of the target nucleic acid. The results are not easily quantified.",
                                "An alternative methodology for determination of methylation status is methylation-sensitive melting curve analysis (MS-MCA) or high resolution melting curve analysis (HRMS-MCA), which is rapid and relatively inexpensive (27). MS-MCA is a reliable technique, and the results do not need to be verified by other techniques, such as is required for example for positive MSP results. The MS-MCA technique is based on the fact that the melting temperature of methylated and unmethylated alleles are different after modification of unmethylated cytosine and amplification, which converts methylated C:G base pairs to A:T base pairs with a lower melting temperature. The standard protocol for determination of methylation status MS-MCA stipulates that the oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the target nucleic acid are devoid of CpG dinucleotides to ensure that the primers does not discriminate between methylated an unmethylated target alleles. This constraint limits the primer binding sites to regions of the template without CpG dinucleotides, which can be very difficult or impossible to find within a CpG cluster in the region of interest. Furthermore, the unmethylated and methylated alleles are not equally efficient amplified. There is a significant bias towards the unmethylated allele in the PCR amplification (23).",
                                "Currently, no methylation detection method has been established for reliable, fast and cost-effective locus specific methylation testing that is readily applicable for both research and diagnostic settings. The research-based methods have various limitations and pitfalls and contradictory results can be obtained using different protocols, therefore none of them have found ready applicability in diagnostics (9).",
                                "A new more reliable method for promoter methylation analyses in clinical samples is needed.",
                                "The present invention offers a method for the determination of methylation status of a CpG-containing nucleic acid by nucleic acid amplification employing a novel design of primers, methylation-independent oligonucleotide primers, that allows for the use of only one set of primers to detect both alleles of a CpG-containing nucleic acid after it has been subjected to C to T conversion by conventional techniques."

Corresponding binding partners in the form of coding elements and complementing elements comprising a nucleotide part are capable of interacting with each other by means of hydrogen bonds. The interaction is generally termed \u201cbase-pairing\u201d. Nucleotides may differ from natural nucleotides by having a different phosphate moiety, sugar moiety and/or base moiety. Nucleotides may accordingly be bound to their respective neighbour(s) in a template or a complementing template by a natural bond in the form of a phosphodiester bond, or in the form of a non-natural bond, such as e.g. a peptide bond as in the case of PNA (peptide nucleic acids). Nucleotides according to the invention includes ribonucleotides comprising a nucleobase selected from the group consisting of adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), and deoxyribonucleotide comprising a nucleobase selected from the group consisting of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Nucleobases are capable of associating specifically with one or more other nucleobases via hydrogen bonds. Thus it is an important feature of a nucleobase that it can only form stable hydrogen bonds with one or a few other nucleobases, but that it can not form stable hydrogen bonds with most other nucleobases usually including itself. The specific interaction of one nucleobase with another nucleobase is generally termed \u201cbase-pairing\u201d. The base pairing results in a specific hybridisation between predetermined and complementary nucleotides. Complementary nucleotides according to the present invention are nucleotides that comprise nucleobases that are capable of base-pairing. Of the naturally occurring nucleobases adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) or uracil (U); and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Accordingly, e.g. a nucleotide comprising A is complementary to a nucleotide comprising either T or U, and a nucleotide comprising G is complementary to a nucleotide comprising C.",

The term oligonucleotide comprises oligonucleotides of both natural and/or non-natural nucleotides, including any combination thereof. The natural and/or non-natural nucleotides may be linked by natural phosphodiester bonds or by non-natural bonds. Preferred oligonucleotides comprises only natural nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds. Oligonucleotide is used interchangeably with polynucleotide. The oligomer or polymer sequences of the present invention are formed from the chemical or enzymatic addition of monomer subunits. The term \u201coligonucleotide\u201d as used herein includes linear oligomers of natural or modified monomers or linkages, including deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, anomeric forms thereof, peptide nucleic acid monomers (PNAs), locked nucleotide acid monomers (LNA), and the like, capable of specifically binding to a single stranded polynucleotide tag by way of a regular pattern of monomer-to-monomer interactions, such as Watson-Crick type of base pairing, base stacking, Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen types of base pairing, or the like. Usually monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs thereof to form oligonucleotides ranging in size from a few monomeric units, e.g. 3-4, to several tens of monomeric units, e.g. 40-60. Whenever an oligonucleotide is represented by a sequence of letters, such as \u201cATGCCTG,\u201d it will be understood that the nucleotides are in 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 order from left to right and the \u201cA\u201d denotes deoxyadenosine, \u201cC\u201d denotes deoxycytidine, \u201cG\u201d denotes deoxyguanosine, and \u201cT\u201d denotes thymidine, unless otherwise noted. Usually oligonucleotides of the invention comprise the four natural nucleotides; however, they may also comprise methylated or non-natural nucleotide analogs. Suitable oligonucleotides may be prepared by the phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage and Carruthers (Tetrahedron Lett., 22, 1859-1862, 1981), or by the triester method according to Matteucci, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 103, 3185, 1981), both incorporated herein by reference, or by other chemical methods using either a commercial automated oligonucleotide synthesizer or VLSIPS.TM. technology. When oligonucleotides are referred to as \u201cdouble-stranded,\u201d it is understood by those of skill in the art that a pair of oligonucleotides exist in a hydrogen-bonded, helical configuration typically associated with, for example, DNA. In addition to the 100% complementary form of double-stranded oligonucleotides, the term \u201cdouble-stranded\u201d as used herein is also meant to refer to those forms which include such structural features as bulges and loops. For example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,722 for a unimolecular double-stranded DNA. It is clear to those skilled in the art when oligonucleotides having natural or non-natural nucleotides may be employed, e.g. where processing by enzymes is called for, usually oligonucleotides consisting of natural nucleotides are required. When nucleotides are conjugated together in a string using synthetic procedures, they are always referred to as oligonucleotides.",

Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) reacts readily with the 5,6-double bond of cytosine, but only poorly with methylated cytosine.

The oligonucleotide primers of the present invention are capable of being employed in amplification reactions, wherein the primers are used in amplification of template DNA originating from either a methylated or an unmethylated strand. The preferred methylation-independent primers of the present invention comprise a CpG dinucleotide, as described below.

If there is a sufficient region of complementary nucleotides, e.g., at least 10, such as at least 12, for example at least 15, such as at least 18, or for example at least 20, for example at least 30, such as at least 40, for example at least 50, such as at least 60, for example at least 70 nucleotides, then the primer may also contain additional nucleotide residues that do not interfere with hybridization but may be useful for other manipulations. Examples of such other residues may be sites for restriction endonuclease cleavage, for ligand binding or for factor binding or linkers.",
                                "The methylation-independent oligonucleotide primer of the present invention is designed to hybridize to CpG-containing nucleic acids in a sample. Importantly, the CpG-containing nucleic acids in that sample are treated with an agent which modifies unmethylated cytosine in said CpG-containing nucleic acid. Thereby, any unmethylated Cytosine of CpG dinucleotides comprised in the CpG-containing nucleic acid are converted to Uracil as explained elsewhere herein. Consequently, in primers comprising a CpG dinucleotide, designed to hybridize with the complementary CpG dinucleotide of the CpG-containing nucleic acid of the sample, the CpG dinucleotide will only hybridize to the methylated CpG dinucleotide fraction of the CpG-containing nucleic acid. In the unmethylated fraction of CpG dinucleotides comprised in the CpG-containing nucleic acid of the sample, Cytosine are modified to uracil which does not hybridize with the CpG dinucleotide of the CpG-containing oligonucleotide primer.",
                                "The methylation-independent oligonucleotide primers according to the present invention are designed to comprise sufficient nucleotides for specific hybridization to the target CpG-containing nucleic acid sequence regardless of its original methylation status. In some embodiments the oligonucleotide primers also comprise one or more CpG dinucleotides, as specified elsewhere herein. These CpG dinucleotides only hybridize with the originally methylated alleles of the CpG-containing nucleic acids. Nevertheless, the oligonucleotide primers can still be functionally used for amplification of both originally methylated and unmethylated nucleic acids. The CpG dinucleotides are typically comprised in the 5\u2032-terminus of the oligonucleotide primers, as described elsewhere herein. A primer-template mismatch within the 5\u2032-terminus of the primer usually allow the primers to hybridize with the target CpG-containing nucleic acid, and still function as primers in an amplification reaction.",
                                "The presence of one or more mismatches between the primer and template affects the optimal annealing temperature of said oligonucleotide primer for use in amplification reactions. The more hybridizing nucleotides comprised on the oligonucleotide primers, the higher is the optimal annealing temperature. Consequently, amplification of methylated alleles of CpG-containing nucleic acids by CpG-containing oligonucleotide primers according to the present invention is favoured by increased annealing temperature. Conversely, amplification of unmethylated alleles is favoured by decreased annealing temperature. In the present invention, the PCR bias towards amplification of unmethylated alleles of a nucleic acid template is reversed by amplification of said nucleic acid template at a relatively higher annealing temperature, which favours oligonucleotide primer binding and priming of the methylated allele. By modulation of the primer annealing temperature, the priming of either the unmethylated modified allele or the methylated allele of the nucleic acid can be favoured. By increasing the annealing temperature below the theoretical optimum, the amplification of the methylated allele is favoured, while a decrease of the annealing temperature will tend to favour amplification of the unmethylated allele.",
                                "Other factors than annealing temperature also affect hybridisation to a CpG-containing target sequence of a methylation-independent primer according to the present invention. At highly stringent conditions, hybridization between perfect matching primer and target sequences are favoured, such as hybridization between a methylation-independent primer according to the present invention and a methylated target sequence upon cytosine modification. Less stringent conditions will tend to favour oligonucleotide primer binding, priming and amplification of the unmethylated allele. Modulation of temperature is one way of adjusting the stringency of hybridization, but the stringency of hybridization may also be modulated by adjusting buffer composition, and/or salt concentrations in the hybridization mixture, which is known to those of skill within the art. The present invention comprises any such method of modulating hybridization stringency to balance the PCR bias towards amplification of unmethylated template. However, modulation of temperature is preferred.",

For DGGE analysis the nucleic acid is subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, wherein the gel contain an increasing gradient of denaturants, such as for example a combination of urea and formamide. The increasing denaturant concentration corresponds to increased temperature, and therefore, a gradient of denaturants mimics a temperature gradient within the gel. The concentrations of denaturants alone, however, are not sufficient to induce DNA melting. Therefore, the gel is immersed in a electrophoresis buffer kept at 54-60 degrees Celsius. When a nucleic acid molecule reaches a level of denaturant that matches the melting temperature of the lowest melting domain, a partially melted intermediate will be formed that moves very slowly. Small shifts in the melting temperature of the low melting domain induced by differences in G:C content will cause the domain to unwind at different concentrations of denaturant. Accordingly, the modified and amplified nucleic acid of the present invention will bi retarded at different positions in the gel, providing the basis for physical separation between species with different G:C contents.",

MS-SSCA uses single-strand conformation analysis for the screening of an amplified region of bisulfite-modified nucleic acid. The amplified products are denatured and electrophoresed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, whereby the sequence differences between unmethylated and methylated sequences lead to the formation of different secondary structures (conformers) with different mobilities. Once the normal mobility pattern is established, any variation would indicate some degree of methylation.",

As for other techniques mentioned herein, DHPLC identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms, which are arise after bisulfite treatment of unmethylated alleles of the CpG containing nucleic acid. The optimum temperature for DHPLC can be predicted by the sequence of the fully methylated product. Subsequently, the temperature is verified to obtain tight peaks. The retention time of the peak reflects methylation status, because the more unmethylated the target is, the less GC rich the PCR product is and the lower the retention time is."

Reconstruction experiments showed that MGMT methylation could be detected at levels as low as 0.1%.

The consistency of HRM profiles allows the design of MS-HRM for estimation of the methylation content of unknown samples on the basis of similarities of normalized HRM profiles. Nevertheless, when designing MS-HRM the length and the number of differences between methylated and unmethylated PCR products need to be taken into account. A short product will give high sensitivity but limited resolution between different levels of methylation because of the smaller differences in melting profiles between methylated and unmethylated products (FIG. 5 and unpublished data). On the other hand, a longer product will give readily distinguishable HRM profiles for PCR products derived from samples with different ratios of methylated and unmethylated template which will allow for the estimation of the methylated proportion of an unknown sample on the basis of similarities of HRM profiles of standards and unknown (FIGS. 4, 6A and 7).

                                "There are many methods for the analysis of methylation at individual loci, each with their characteristic strengths and weaknesses (9). However, only a few protocols have gained widespread use. Genomic sequencing can be considered the gold standard (18,19). It provides the most detailed information but its sensitivity is relatively low (about 20%) and it is generally unsuitable for screening because it is expensive to run, particularly when individual clones are analysed. Pyrosequencing, which has been recently introduced, is more sensitive (about 5%) but is dependent on the availability of the proprietary instrumentation (20). The most widely used method is methylation-specific PCR (MSP) that uses primers specific for methylated, bisulphite-modified DNA (21). Unmethylated sequences are not normally amplified unless primers specific for unmethylated bisulphite modified DNA are designed. Despite its widespread use, MSP has a number of important limitations (9,22). As with other techniques that rely on PCR primer 30 mismatching to give specificity, false positives can arise if primers are badly designed or used at too low a temperature. MSP is very sensitive but is not quantitative. This can lead to the classification of a tumour as being methylated for a gene when a small minority of cells only is positive, or more seriously, if the bisulphite conversion of the DNA is incomplete. Consistent with these reservations, in the recent trial of temozolomide in glioblastoma, it was reported that testing for MGMT methylation using MSP gave \u2018highly variable and centre-dependent\u2019 results (8). The majority of applications in methylation studies utilize methylation-independent PCR (MIP) where the primers are designed to amplify the bisulphite-modified sequence regardless of its methylation status. However, the standard algorithms for the design of MIP primers and the protocols used do not always lead to the proportional amplification of methylated and unmethylated sequences (13,20,23). As it is often difficult to avoid CpG dinucleotides in primers designed to amplify CpG islands, some authors have suggested that the Cs in CpG sequences in primers get replaced by a mismatched base (19). Other authors have suggested that since the purpose of these assays is to detect methylation, some bias towards methylated sequences is acceptable and that a limited number of CpGs can be included in the primers, particularly if they are placed away from the 30 end (24). More recently, it has been shown that some CpGs are necessary in the primer sequence, otherwise PCR bias can lead to a significant underestimate of the degree of methylation (13). We have accordingly adopted the strategy of using primers containing limited numbers of CpGs and manipulating the annealing temperature to control the bias of PCR amplification in the design of MS-HRM assays. At lower annealing temperatures, the primers bind both methylated and unmethylated templates and PCR bias will favour the amplification of unmethylated sequences. At higher annealing temperatures, primer binding will favour methylated sequences, and thus at the optimal annealing temperature, amplification is effectively independent of methylation status. Therefore, MS-HRM can be used to estimate the proportion of methylation of a sample when run with standards. This is especially important when assessing clinical cancer samples for predictive markers such as MGMT where discrimination between tumour specimens that are methylated in all cells of the tumour from those that only show methylation in a small subset of their cells may have prognostic value. In the ideal situation, an estimate of the proportion of tumour cells in the sample will be given by pathological examination of the tissue and this can be compared with the estimated proportion of DNA that is methylated. Furthermore, if the tumour samples are of high purity, they can be used to determine whether the tumour is homozygously or heterozygously methylated. The technique would also be applicable to the diagnosis of imprinting disorders that are characterized by the abnormal methylation of imprinted genes. High resolution melting relies on the use of high sensitivity florescence detection instrumentation, fully saturating intercalating dyes and software allowing the analysis of the melting profiles of PCR products. We developed HRM for discrimination between methylated and unmethylated sequences after bisulphite modification of the target DNA. Sodium bisulphite converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil and leaves methylated cytosines intact. Therefore, the PCR product derived from a methylated template will have a higher melting temperature than that from an unmethylated template and those differences can be resolved by melting analysis. We have shown that HRM is applicable for the very sensitive detection of methylation in an unmethylated background. With MS-HRM, we were able to unambiguously detect the methylated fraction of DNA in samples containing as little as 0.1-1.0% of methylated DNA, the same range as seen for the MethylLight assay (25). MS-HRM is an in-tube method meaning that the analysis takes place without the PCR product leaving the tube that it was amplified in. This is of importance for diagnostic laboratories not only because of the rapidity that it affords, but also the elimination of PCR product contamination which has proven to be a major problem both in research and the diagnostic settings. An in-tube strategy based on the analysis of derivative peaks of melting curves of PCR products to assess methylation has already been reported (26,27). This has not become widely used presumably because of the difficulty of the suggested guidelines for assay design and the technical limitations of reagents, instrumentation and data analysis software which have now been overcome since the development of HRM methodology. MethylLight, the other in-tube method, is used by a greater number of laboratories. It is a quantitative adaptation of MSP that uses TaqMan probes. Whereas MethylLight assays methylation of CpG sites covered by the primers and probe, MS-HRM scans all of the CpGs flanked by the primers-binding to the target sequence, regardless of the methylation status of CpGs in the primer binding side. Thus, the results of MS-HRM are not compromised by heterogeneous methylation of a particular CpG dinucleotide or incomplete conversion of some of CpGs within the template, as the latter will fall below the limits of resolution. Heterogeneous methylation can readily be distinguished from homogeneous methylation by the shape of the curves as seen for HS678T. Moreover, the use of probes in MethylLight complicates the design and increases the costs of experiments. Also quantitative MethylLight requires normalization against a reference assay which needs to be run for each sample (24). By contrast, MS-HRM does not require a reference assay for normalization. All of the above make MethylLight experiments relatively complex and expensive. In summary, MS-HRM is a new approach that can be readily applied to the methylation analysis of MGMT. It can also be readily extended to other loci as we have shown for the BNIP3 locus. The sensitivity of MSHRM allows for detection of even a very small fraction of methylated material which is of importance as tumour samples may contain a low proportion of methylated sequences due to the presence of significant amounts of normal tissue or heterogeneity of the tumour. Furthermore, the high reproducibility and cost effectiveness of HRM makes this method suitable for both research and diagnostic applications."

PCR products amplified from bisulfite modified DNA have significantly different base compositions according to whether they originate from methylated or unmethylated variants of the target template. Different base compositions give rise to different thermal properties of the PCR products. Hence, melting analysis of amplification products in methylation studies allows the determination of whether the PCR products originate from methylated or unmethylated templates. Here, we briefly review recent advances in methodologies based on melting analyses of PCR products derived from bisulfite modified templates and provide a methodology for methylation-sensitive high resolution melting.",
                                "**1. Introduction**",
                                "The introduction of bisulfite modification of genomic DNA enabled the general use of PCR amplification in methylation studies (1). Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracils leaving 5-methylcytosines intact. As a consequence, methylated cytosines are amplified during the subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as cytosines whereas unmethylated cytosines are amplified as thymines. Hence, the base composition of the PCR product depends on the 5-methylcytosine content of the template. The two complementary strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. Dissociation of double-stranded DNA is known as DNA melting or denaturation and can be induced either by increased temperature or denaturing chemicals. The dissociation of the triple hydrogen bond between C and G requires more energy than the dissociation of the double hydrogen bond between T and A, therefore GC rich sequences melt at relatively higher temperatures compared to AT rich sequences. The melting of a DNA amplicon often consists of a series of progressive dissociations of shorter domains within the sequence, which due to their local GC content have different melting temperatures. The sequence dependent melting of an amplicon across a denaturing gradient is described as a \u2018melting profile\u2019. The melting profile of an amplicon can be determined by subjecting it to a gradually increasing temperature in the presence of an intercalating fluorescent dye, which emit fluorescence when bound (intercalated) to double-stranded DNA. At temperatures below the initiation of the melting process, the intercalating dye saturates the PCR product resulting in high levels of fluorescence. As the temperature rises, the fluorescence levels are stable until the point at which the double-stranded amplicon begins to separate into single strands, and a marked drop in fluorescence is observed as the dye is released from the double-stranded DNA. Thus, by monitoring the fluorescence during the increase of the temperature, it is possible to determine the melting profile of a PCR amplicon. The melting profiles of PCR products originating from methylated and unmethylated variants of the same template are significantly different due to their different GC content. Therefore the methylation status of an unknown sample can be determined by comparing the melting profile of the PCR product with the melting profiles of PCR products obtained from the amplification of methylated and unmethylated control templates. The first application of melting curve analysis to the profiling of DNA methylation was reported in 2001 (2). This methodology was not generally adopted as SYBR Green I, the principal fluorescent dye used at that time, could not be used at concentrations that fully saturated the PCR products, thereby blunting the resolution of the methodology. Current advances in fluorescence detection technology, new algorithms for data calculation, and the use of novel dyes have allowed the development of high resolution melting analysis (HRM) (3). We applied HRM to methylation analysis in the methodology that we called Methylation-Sensitive High Resolution Melting (MS-HRM). Together with a novel approach to primer design (see section 3.1), which allows the control of PCR bias and hence highly sensitive detection of low-level methylation, MS-HRM is proving to be a powerful new methodology for methylation analysis.",

                                "The primers for amplification of bisulfite modified DNA for MS-HRM studies have to amplify the sequence of interest regardless of its methylation status (MIP\u2014methylation independent primers) (6). It is important to note that when using one primer set for the amplification of two templates with different GC content, the PCR will be biased towards the template with lower GC content (FIG. 41) (5,7). The most commonly followed rules in primer design advise not to include any CG nucleotides into the primer sequence and, if this is not possible, to mismatch the C from CG with T (8). In our experience, following the above rules led to amplifications which showed strong bias towards the unmethylated sequence (5). We proposed new guidelines for MIP primer design where inclusion of a limited number of CGs towards the 5\u2032 end of the sequence allowed us to manipulate PCR bias (5,6, FIG. 41). When primers containing a limited number of CpGs are used, their relative binding affinity for methylated and unmethylated templates is annealing temperature dependent. Hence by manipulating the annealing temperature of the PCR amplification with MIP primers, one can shift the PCR bias from the unmethylated to the methylated sequence and make the assay highly sensitive for methylation detection. If there is no methylated template available, the primers with limited CpGs will amplify unmethylated sequence even at high annealing temperature. That allows not only the determination of the methylation status of the sample but at the same time to the confirmation of the unmethylated status of the template. Apart from this point, good practice for primer design such as matching primer melting temperatures, selection against unconverted sequences (inclusion of a T derived from a non-CpG at or near the 3\u2032 end of the primer) and prediction of primer dimer formation should be followed for the design of MIP primers. The melting temperature of MIP primers should be around 65\u00b0 C. (e.g. using Oligonucleotide properties calculator http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html for calculation of the melting temperature of the primers) allowing an annealing temperature of 60\u00b0 C., which is an empirical value at which our primer design gives good results in our hands. Each primer set should be extensively tested on the mixes of methylated and unmethylated controls for the performance and the extent of PCR bias (see Note 2).",

                                "Long sequences can have very complex melting profiles due to the fact that they consist of multiple small melting domains. Ideally, the melting profile of the sequence of interest should consist of a single melting domain that gives only one drop in the fluorescence and makes melting results easy to interpret. Amplicons of 100 bp or less often comprise only one major melting domain and therefore the recommended size of the PCR amplicon for melting analyses is around this size. A rough estimate of the melting profile of the sequence of interest can be made on freely available tools like POLAND: http://www.biophys.uniduesseldorf. de/local/POLAND//poland.html, or the MELT94 algorithm (available from http://web.mit.edu/osp/www/melt.html). The complex melting of a PCR product containing more than one melting domain may complicate melting analyses as drops in fluorescence observed for short melting domains within the sequence can mask the fluorescence changes specific for the methylated/unmethylated alleles.",

                                "The tools described in 3.3. can also be used to estimate the melting temperature of methylated and unmethylated variants of the template. Sequences originating from methylated allele where the C within CpG dinucleotides has not been changed will have a higher melting temperature in comparison to the sequence originating from unmethylated allele where all the C were changed into Ts. The difference in melting temperature of unmethylated and methylated templates depends on the number and density of CpGs in the amplicon. It is important to make sure that the difference in melting temperature between methylated and unmethylated version of the sequence is large enough to unambiguously distinguish both alleles during melting. When low-resolution fluorescence detection systems are used the melting temperature differences between methylated and unmethylated PCR product has to be significant. With HRM systems, very small differences in melting temperature can be unambiguously resolved as the specification of the systems allow for highly sensitive fluorescence acquisition and precise control of temperature ramp rates (see Note 3).",
                                "**3.5. PCR Amplification**",
                                "PCR reagents from different suppliers differ in their ability to amplify bisulfite modified DNA (unpublished data). The differences tend to be polymerase dependent and good quality polymerases are necessary for successful PCR amplification of bisulfite-modified template. Hot Start protocols give superior results to regular amplification techniques when bisulfite modified DNA is used as a template (see Note 4), (unpublished data). 0.5-1 U polymerase with standard dNTP concentration (200 \u03bcM each) is sufficient in most of applications. The role of Mg+2 concentration and input template amount will be discussed separately 3.5.1. Mg+2 concentration The amplification of bisulfite modified DNA is rarely as robust as amplification of genomic DNA presumably due to the extensive degradation of DNA during incubation with bisulfite. As a consequence, the use of high concentrations of Mg+2 to enhance PCR amplification is essential in many cases. The Mg+2 concentration in polymerase buffers is generally insufficient to give a high yield of PCR product from bisulfite modified DNA. In our hands, most amplifications for melting analyses required a Mg+2 concentration of 2.5-3.5 mM. In general, the concentration of Mg+2 in amplifications of bisulfite-modified template has to be empirically adjusted for each assay and is dependent on the bisulfite modification protocol, the PCR reagents used and input of bisulfite-modified template. 3.5.2. Bisulfite template input for PCR amplification The main problem in methylation studies is the degradation of DNA during bisulfite modification. As high as 90% degradation of the template has been reported (9). Our practice shows that the greater the quantity of DNA that is subjected to bisulfite modification, the less the extent of degradation and more template available for PCR amplifications. In cancer research especially, the amount of available sample DNA is generally a limiting factor in methylation studies (see Note 5). The use of carrier DNA (e.g. herring or salmon sperm DNA) can partly solve the problem allowing for higher recovery rates when small amounts of genomic DNA are subjected to bisulfite modification. The sensitivity of the melting assay is directly correlated to the input DNA for bisulfite modification. With MS-HRM, we were able to reproducibly detect 1-0.1% methylated sequence in unmethylated background when 1 g genomic DNA was used for bisulfite modification. Post modification DNA recovery rates also depend on the system used to purify DNA. In our experience, procedures using purification columns are superior to precipitation protocols, especially when an inexperienced person performed the bisulfite modification. 3.5.3. PCR amplification parameters The PCR amplification of bisulfite modified DNA may require up to 50-60 cycles of amplification to obtain a sufficient yield of PCR product for melting analyses. The number of cycles depends on the assay and real time monitoring of the amplification allows for the adjustment of the cycles number. The PCR should be stopped where possible just before amplification reaches the plateau phase. When amplification is carried on too long, the byproducts of PCR may disturb the melting profile of the sequence of interest (see Note 6). For an example, see Note 7.",
                                "3.6. Re-annealing of PCR product and the design of temperature gradient for melting analyses Before subjecting PCR products to temperature gradients, the PCR product should be reannealed. The protocol for re-annealing of the PCR product should consist of a denaturation step at 95\u00b0 C. for one minute and fast cool down and hold for one minute (to allow reannealing of all the DNA strands) at the temperature from which acquisition of the fluorescence for melting procedure starts. The range of temperatures for temperature gradient has to be investigated empirically and it depends on the melting temperatures of unmethylated and methylated PCR product The gradient has to fully cover the melting temperatures of methylated and unmethylated PCR product (see Notes 3, 6 and 7).\n\n3.7. Acquisition of the fluorescence The precise and accurate acquisition of fluorescence, and small temperature transition rates are the foundations of high resolution melting analysis. On the first generation of LightCyclers, the temperature ramp rates could be as low as 0.05\u00b0 C./s. This allowed in combination with continuous fluorescence acquisition the attainment of detailed melting curves. Fluorescence acquisition systems in the new generation of the instruments have even higher specifications allowing collection of higher quality data. We have tested two of the HRM instruments available on the market, the LC480 (Roche) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett). The settings for data collection in melting experiments giving us satisfactory results for the LC480 system were 50 fluorescence acquisition points per \u00b0 C. The corresponding temperature ramp rate for 50 acquisitions per degree was calculated automatically by the instrument by taking into account the time needed at each degree for sufficient acquisition of fluorescence. For the RG-6000 the HRM default settings were used consisting of the continuous acquisition of the fluorescence with a temperature ramp rate of 0.1\u00b0 C. and a 2 s hold on each step. The parameters of the melting gradient can be adjusted individually for each melting assay on both the LC480 and the RG-6000 (see Note 7).",
                                "**3.8. Analysis of the Results**",
                                "3.8.1. Derivative peak Melting curves are generated by continuous acquisition of fluorescence from the samples subjected to the linear temperature gradient. For basic analyses, the melting curves can be converted to peaks by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence over the temperature (\u2212dF/dT) versus temperature (FIG. 42). The top of the peak represents the highest drop of fluorescence during melting and can be interpreted as the melting temperature of the PCR product (Tm). In methylation studies, two peaks, one for unmethylated (lower Tm) and one for methylated (higher Tm), are obtained from the control samples. Comparing the peaks of an unknown sample with controls scores the methylation status of the unknown sample (see Note 1). Heterogeneously methylated templates give a broader peak due to the formation of heteroduplexes (see Note 8).\n\n3.8.2. Direct visualization of melting The high resolution data collected on HRM instruments allowed the development of new algorithms for melting curve analyses. After PCR amplification, even replicates of the same sample can differ in the amount of PCR product amplified and therefore display different fluorescence levels. The differences between samples are especially pronounced when HRM detection is used which does not allow for direct comparison of the curves as the HRM curves have to be normalized for starting and ending levels of fluorescence to make them comparable (FIG. 43a). The new algorithms supplied with HRM instruments allow for normalization of the starting levels of fluorescence. After normalization, similarly shaped curves, which before were visually not readily comparable, group together. If unknown samples are run with standards of known methylated to unmethylated template ratios, the level of methylation in screened samples can be estimated by comparison of their melting curves to the melting curves of standards (FIG. 43b, see Notes 2 and 6).",
                                "**4. Notes**",
                                "1. Bisulfite modified DNA should be used up as soon as possible after modification. For longer storage: aliquot the stock DNA into small amounts that are thawed for each run. Repetitive freezing and thawing of the bisulfite DNA hastens its degradation.\n\n2. Standards for MS-HRM analyses/primers optimization can be obtained by mixing of bisulfite modified methylated and unmethylated controls. The equal amount of DNA has to be used for bisulfite modification of controls. Unmethylated control can be DNA from any tissue where the locus of interest is not methylated. The methylation status of the locus of interest in control DNA has to be investigated prior to analyses as some loci have different methylation status in different tissues. We routinely use CpGenome\u2122 Universal Methylated DNA (Millipore Co.) for the methylated-control. SssI treated DNA is an alternative to CpGenome\u2122 Universal Methylated DNA, but complete methylation of the genomic DNA by SssI enzyme can be difficult to achieve.\n\n3. The numerical calculations of the melting temperatures of the methylated and unmethylated PCR products are a good estimate, nevertheless the range of the temperatures for melting experiments has to be adjusted/corrected after the first run of the experiments.\n\n4. A 3 step PCR amplification protocol including an extension step was superior to a two step protocol. When a two step set up is used, some polymerases may generate by products and/or incompletely elongated amplicons that interfered with melting analyses.\n\n5. MS-HRM analysis can also be performed on formalin fixed tissues. As many of these will be extensively degraded, the success rate will be increased here by using relatively small (less than 100 base pairs) amplicons.\n\n6. In MS-HRM, the sensitivity of detection of lower levels of methylation depends on the extent of PCR bias during PCR amplification. As the PCR bias can be adjusted by annealing temperature, the range of the standards has to be designed to each experiment individually and depending on the goals of the user.\n\n7. The MS-HRM protocol used in the methylation screening experiments of MGMT gene performed on the LC 480. Primers: F-CGTTTGCGATTTGGTGAGTGTT and RACCCCGCCCTACCCTATAAATTC. PCR cycling and HRM analysis conditions were as follows: initial activation 10 min at 95\u00b0 C. and 50 cycles of 5 s 95\u00b0 C., 5 s at 63\u00b0 C. and 5 s at 72\u00b0 C. Subsequently the product was denatured for 1 min at 95\u00b0 C., re annealed by fast cooling and held for 1 minute at 75\u00b0 C. The HRM analyses were performed in the temperature interval 70-95\u00b0 C. With 50 acquisitions per \u00b0 C. and the default fluorescence temperature gradient parameters selected by the instrument see paragraph 3.7 and FIG. 42 and FIG. 43 for an example of the analysis of the results.\n\n8. Heterogeneously methylated templates can be observed in many amplifications. On derivative curves, these are characterized by a broader melting peak typically starting before the unmethylated peak and extending into the methylated peak area. This is due to the formation of heteroduplexes, between heterogeneously methylated templates. An important advantage of MS-HRM is that, unlike many other methods, it allows the detection of heterogeneous methylation.",

Hence, they show different melting profiles when subjected to thermal denaturation. The Methylation Sensitive High Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) protocol is based on the comparison of the melting profiles of PCR products from unknown samples with profiles specific for PCR products derived from methylated and unmethylated references. The protocol consists of the PCR amplification of bisulfite modified DNA templates with primers designed to proportionally amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates at the same time and subsequent high resolution analysis of the PCR product. The MS-HRM protocol allows investigation of the methylation status of the locus of interest in less than 3 hours. Here we provide the methodology for highly sensitive, labor and cost efficient single locus methylation studies based on DNA high resolution melting technology.",

                                "The proportional amplification of bisulfite modified methylated and unmethylated templates can be compromised by PCR bias due to the fact that they have different base compositions. PCR bias is described as the preferential amplification of one DNA template. The PCR bias in methylation studies has long been recognized and is principally directed towards the unmethylated (GC-poor) strand 16. The relative disproportionate amplification of the unmethylated strand may result in misinterpretation of the final results and the underestimation of methylation levels. The extent of PCR bias is sequence specific and can be compensated by optimizing the annealing temperature of PCR amplification 18. The widely adopted primer design guidelines for post amplification methylation analyses protocols advise not to include any CpG nucleotides into the primer sequence and if not possible to do so, to use a mismatched C from CpG dinucleotide with T to avoid the preferential binding of the primer to methylated template 11. We have shown that in some most cases, inclusion of limited number of CpGs into the primer sequence is necessary to compensate for PCR bias 15,17. Our primer design system is thus based upon the inclusion of a limited number of CpG dinucleotides into the primer sequence enabling the conditionally selective binding of the primer to the methylated sequence and therefore enables compensation of PCR bias that would otherwise normally favor the amplification of the unmethylated template. Furthermore, reversal of PCR bias to favor methylated sequences increases the sensitivity of the melting assays allowing detecting methylation levels as low as 1-0.1%, which is the level of sensitivity similar to MSP. Our primer design guidelines are outlined below (for examples see Table 1).",
                                "1. Primers should usually contain one or two CpGs dinucleotides each.\n\n2. The CpGs should be placed as close as possible to the 5\u2032 end of the primer\n\n3. The melting temperature of the primers should be matched, preferably within one degree.\n\n4. The 3\u2032 end of the primer should contain one or more Ts specific to non-CpG Cs, to ensure amplification of only bisulfite converted template.\n\n5. The primers should meet standard parameters for primer design e.g. secondary structure, primer dimer formation.\n\n6. The preferred length of the amplified sequence should be around 100 bp to reduce the complexity of the melting profile.",
