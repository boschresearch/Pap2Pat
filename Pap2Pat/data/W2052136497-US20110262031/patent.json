                        "Image Based Rendering (IBR) is a method generating novel scenes from a set of reference images. The reference images are actual pictures of an object and color may be calculated from pixels in the reference images. Thus, IBR is a method for achieving photo realism. Image-based Visual Hull (IBVH) is a type of Image Based Rendering that may be used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) models from a group of reference images of an object. A conventional IBVH technique involves a 3D reconstruction method that takes a group of pictures as input, and produces a convex hull of the target object.",
                        "The conventional IBVH technique uses the object silhouette in reference images to recover the geometry information. However, a problem with this conventional technique is that the silhouette is not capable of revealing information of a concave region on the surface of an object (i.e., referred to as a concave object). Consequently, the concave object is difficult to reconstruct. In particular, the conventional IBVH technique can lead to a protuberant defect and subsequently diminished photo-realism. An example of a reconstructed object having a protuberant defect is shown in FIG. 2. The development of a protuberant defect is partly because the concave region is always surrounded by the rest of the object. Consequently, the conventional IBVH technique has problems in acquiring the geometry of the concave object with reference images."

The silhouette processing module 402 captures or accesses images of an object and extracts the silhouette of the object. Virtual-image synthesis module 404 sets a virtual camera at the bottom of the concave object, maps the silhouette to the image space of the virtual camera, and synthesizes virtual images to form a visual hull.",
                        "The concave object modeling processing application 123 involves an IBVH technique which is based on shape-from-silhouette 3D reconstruction. Generally a shape-from-silhouette 3D reconstruction creates a geometric entity referred to as a silhouette cone. In shape-from-silhouette 3D reconstruction, the original image is subjected to thresholding to produce a foreground/background binary image, which is referred to as a silhouette image. A foreground mask, known as a silhouette, is the 2D projection of the corresponding 3D foreground object. Along with the camera viewing parameters, the silhouette defines a back-projected generalized cone that encompasses the 3D object. This generalized cone is the silhouette cone.",
                        "The Image-Based Visual Hull (IBVH) process produces a visual hull from an intersection of generalized cones. In general, the IBVH process takes a group of photos as input, and produces a convex hull of the target object. The convex hull is the visual hull for the object. In the process, each reference image is separated into foreground and background. The foreground mask, i.e. silhouette, along with the calibration information of the camera, defines a back-projected cone in 3D space that contains the target object. Calibration information of the camera includes focal length and camera position. The intersection of all silhouette cones forms the convex hull of the object. An example illustration of a visual hull is shown in FIG. 7.",
                        "FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a method that eliminates the protuberant shaped distortion from the visual hull for an object. The visual hull in FIG. 7 illustrates elements described in the method steps. As shown in FIG. 5, in step 502, a visual hull 704 for an object having a concave region is obtained from a group of photos as a set of reference images 702, which are taken from the perspective of the outside of the object. In FIG. 5, in Step 504, 3D coordinates of the concave region boundary are calculated on the visual hull. FIG. 10a shows an example reference concave region image taken from directly above the concave region.",

                        "In FIG. 6, step 602, the concave region boundary 708 on a 2D reference picture 706 is determined by manual interaction or an image segmentation technique.",
                        "The technique of image segmentation generally refers to a process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels; also known as superpixels). The goal of image segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. In particular, image segmentation involves assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics. Image segmentation is used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. In the case of step 602, image segmentation can be used to locate the boundary for the concave region.",
                        "The result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image. Each of the pixels in a region are similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions are significantly different with respect to the same characteristic(s).",
                        "FIG. 10b shows an example of intermediate results obtained using image segmentation, in which the boundary of the concave region is identified.",
                        "In FIG. 6, step 604, 3D coordinates for the concave region boundary 710 on the visual hull 704 are determined using the concave region boundary 708 on the 2D reference picture 706 determined in Step 602 by projecting positions on the 2D reference picture back to 3D space. Steps in performing projection of positions on the 2D reference picture back to 3D space are IBVH process steps.",
                        "Continuing with the method illustrated in FIG. 5, in Step 506, a position for a virtual camera inside the concave region is chosen. A position of the virtual camera is chosen that corresponds to observing the object from inside of the concave region toward the outside. In one embodiment as shown for example in FIG. 8, a position at which the virtual camera is located at the center of the bottom of the concave region can be chosen. Alternatively, other positions such as one at the edge of the bottom of the concave region can be chosen as well. The chosen position allows a virtual inside-out image to be generated at such position to include a complete concave region boundary. Subsequently, several positions can be chosen as long as the virtual inside-out images cover the complete concave region boundary aggregately.",
                        "In Step 508, the camera parameters of the virtual camera are determined based on the selected position.",
                        "When the center of the virtual camera is set, the transformation vector of the external parameters of the camera is determined. For the rotation matrix of the external parameters, the three rotation angles are commonly set as a \u03b1=0; \u03b2=90; \u03b3=0, so that the orientation of the virtual camera stays upward and vertical to the bottom of the object, enabling simulation of capturing from the bottom directly under the concave object. For internal parameters, only the focal length f needs to be modified, other factors remain consistent with corresponding factors of an actual camera shooting reference images. Normally the focal length of the virtual camera depends on the depth of the concave object proportionally. Based on the known parameters of the camera shooting the reference images, the value of focal length f of the virtual image may be set such that the entire region of the concave region boundary is within the virtual image shot by the virtual camera.",
                        "The camera parameters are chosen such that the virtual inside-out images taken by the virtual camera based on those camera parameters cover the complete concave region boundary aggregately.",
                        "In Step 510, an image of the silhouette and the texture of the concave region is captured, for example, from outside and directly above the concave region, as a reference concave region image, in which a complete concave region boundary is included. Alternatively, several images can be taken as long as the complete concave region boundary can be covered by the several images aggregately.",
                        "In Step 512, the virtual inside-out image is generated based on the 3D coordinates of the concave region boundary generated in step 504, the camera parameters generated in step 508, and the reference concave region image obtained in step 510 by using a conventional technique for 3D to 2D perspective projection.",
                        "The step 512 of 3D to 2D perspective projection is illustrated in FIG. 9. The 3D to 2D perspective projection in step 512 is a method in which the reference concave region image 902, which is in a 2D plane, is projected into a 3D space 904. The concave region boundary 906 in the 3D space is projected to the virtual inside-out image 908 in a 2D plane.",
                        "One or several virtual inside-out images (with different virtual camera positions) can be generated as long as such one or several virtual inside-out images can cover the complete concave region boundary.",

                        "The process of 3D to 2D perspective projection can be performed using a visual hull generated using an Image-Based Visual Hull (IBVH) process.",
                        "Furthermore, a revised visual hull of the concave object can be generated using the original reference images along with one or several virtual inside-out images as additional reference images. The one or several virtual inside-out images are used as a reference image(s), and the segments between the intersection points of the virtual inside-out image are subtracted (via subtraction Boolean operation) from the view ray. Also, in the case that several virtual inside-out images are used as a reference image, the segments of them are subtracted aggregately.",
                        "In particular, in generating a revised visual hull for the concave object, a subtraction Boolean operation is carried out for the segments mapped from the virtual inside-out image generated based on the virtual camera, and an intersection Boolean operation is carried out for the segments mapped from other reference pictures.",
                        "An example that demonstrates steps in calculating a revised visual hull for the concave region is illustrated in FIG. 12, and involves the following steps as depicted in FIG. 11.",
                        "In FIG. 11, step 1102, for a pixel of a novel view image (1202 in FIG. 12) which is shot by a novel camera (the \u201cnovel\u201d camera means an actual camera that is shooting the object from a novel view which is different from the viewing direction of all other reference images 1204 in FIG. 12), a view ray is calculated, which is emitted from the center of the novel camera and passes through the pixel of the novel view image. The projection of this view ray on a reference image 1204, i.e. the projected view ray, can be determined by using the position information of the novel camera.",
                        "In a similar manner, a projected view ray is also determined for virtual inside-out images 1208 as virtual reference images.",
                        "In FIG. 11, step 1104, points where the projected view ray intersects the 2D silhouette on the reference image 1204 result in a set of 2D intervals on the reference image.",
                        "In FIG. 11, step 1106, 2D intervals on the reference image are projected back to 3D space 1206 such that corresponding 3D segments on the view ray are obtained.",
                        "In FIG. 11, step 1108, a 1D Boolean intersection operation is carried out onto all the projected 3D line segments from all of the reference images 1204, the result of which, i.e. the intersection of all the 3D segments from all the reference images 1204, indicates the visual hull boundary for the pixel of the novel view image.",
                        "In FIG. 11, step 1110, a 2D interval on the one or more virtual inside-out images 1208 is projected back to 3D space 1206 to obtain a corresponding segment(s) on the view ray; then, a subtraction Boolean operation is performed for the segments mapped from the virtual inside-out image and the view ray in order to obtain a visual hull for the object having the concave region.",

The virtual inside-out images enable a view of an object that is not possible to obtain using conventional image-based visual hull techniques. In addition, the virtual inside-out images can be used in generating a refined visual hull of an object having a concave region, in which the visual hull accurately portrays the geometry of the object. In addition, the refined visual hull can be used to obtain photo-realistic images of the object that are without the protuberant defect.",

                        "The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely examples, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermediate components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected,\u201d or \u201coperably coupled,\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable,\u201d to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components and/or wirelessly interactable and/or wirelessly interacting components and/or logically interacting and/or logically interactable components.",

                        "It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to disclosures containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d",
