                        "The rapid advancement of CRISPR/Cas-based technologies has allowed for the modification (i.e., deletion, mutation and insertion) of human cells at precise genomic locations. For applications in which precise editing of a single nucleotide is desired, the CRISPR/Cas machinery can be used to introduce site-specific double-stranded breaks (DSB) followed by homology-directed repair (HDR) using an exogenous DNA template. However, HDR is inefficient in mammalian cells, especially in recalcitrant cells such as human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and repair of DSB is predominantly achieved through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In addition, NHEJ results in insertion or deletion of nucleotides (indels), resulting in undesired disruption (e.g. frameshift mutations, premature stop codons, deletion) of the targeted genes.",
                        "As an alternative to standard gene editing approaches that require a DSB, several groups have reported the development of deaminase base editors that do not rely on HDR to introduce single nucleotide genomic changes. Broadly speaking, these base editors consist of a fusion of three components\u2014a DOA nickase Cas endonuclease, cytidine deaminase (APOBEC1), and a DNA uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI). This complex is capable of converting cytosine to thymine (or adenine to guanine on the complementary strand) without the need for a DSB and homology repair template. Overall, genome modification through the use of base editors has been shown to result in formation of fewer indels when compared to HDR-based methods.",
                        "Despite the advantages that deaminase base editors offer, identification and isolation of cell populations that have been successfully edited remains challenging. Specifically, there is no readily detectable phenotype to distinguish edited from unedited cells. In turn, isolation of edited cell populations requires single cell isolation followed by downstream sequencing verification. Some progress has been made to help enrich for edited cells, such as co-transfecting plasmids with a fluorescent reporter and using flow cytometry to isolate reporter-positive cells. Similarly, base editors fused to fluorescent proteins have been used to enrich for edited cell populations. However, these techniques are only reporters of transfection (RoT) and do not report on base editing activity within a cell population. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for materials and efficient methods for selecting and enriching for base-edited human cells. There also remains a need in the art for efficient methods for producing isogenic populations of base edited human cells, particularly human pluripotent stem cell populations having targeted genetic modifications."

                        "The compositions and methods provided herein are based at least in part on the Inventors' development of real-time, fluorescent-based methods for identification and isolation of base-edited cell populations. In particular, the disclosure provides a transient reporter for editing enrichment (TREE) to efficiently select and isolate base-edited cells from non-edited cells. As described herein, TREE takes advantage of a detectable change in a reporter protein signal as a direct reporter of base editing activity within a cell. Compared to conventional cell enrichment strategies that employ reporters of transfection (RoT), TREE significantly improved the editing efficiency at multiple independent loci, with efficiencies approaching 80%. Using these methods, it is possible to target multiple separate loci for gene editing and to identify and separate base edited cells from non-edited cells, all without homology directed repair (HDR). The combination of TREE with these base-editing methods yield isogenic genetically modified human pluripotent stem cell lines, with single-nucleotide editing efficiencies of >80% across multiple hPSC lines. Also described herein are methods that are particularly advantageous for efficient generation of loss-of-function and gain-of-function hPSC lines via introduction of premature stop codons or other genetic modifications, and for multiplex editing of hPSCs at several independent loci. These methods allow for the precise and efficient base editing of hPSCs for use in developmental biology, disease modeling, drug screening, and cell-based therapies.",
                        "Accordingly, in a first aspect, a polynucleotide encoding one or more reporter protein. The polynucleotide includes a PAM site adjacent to a base that when edited causes a change in a function or characteristic of the one or more reporter proteins. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide encodes a reporter protein with at least 90% sequence similarity to SEQ ID NO: 2, wherein the polynucleotide encodes histidine at amino acid at position number 66, relative to SEQ ID NO: 1 is provided, and encodes glycine at amino acid position number 72 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. Alternatively, a reporter polypeptide may include two fluorescent proteins with at least 90% sequence identity to one of SEQ ID NO: 316 or 318. In another alternative, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 258, 259 and 260. The polypeptides may include a polypeptide having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to any one of the polypeptides provided herein. The polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides provided herein may include polynucleotides having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% sequence identity to the polynucleotides provided herein. The polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides provided herein may be operably linked to a heterologous promoter.

Notably each of the constructs claimed are recombinant molecules and as such do not occur in nature. Generally, the nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures utilized in the present invention include molecular, biochemical, and recombinant DNA techniques that are well known and commonly employed in the art. Standard techniques available to those skilled in the art may be used for cloning, DNA and RNA isolation, amplification and purification. Such techniques are thoroughly explained in the literature.",
                        "The constructs provided herein may include a promoter operably linked to any one of the polynucleotides described herein. As used herein, the terms \u201cheterologous promoter,\u201d \u201cpromoter,\u201d \u201cpromoter region,\u201d or \u201cpromoter sequence\u201d refer generally to transcriptional regulatory regions of a gene, which may be found at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 side of the polynucleotides described herein, or within the coding region of the polynucleotides, or within introns in the polynucleotides. Typically, a promoter is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) coding sequence. The typical 5\u2032 promoter sequence is bounded at its 3\u2032 terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5\u2032 direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence is a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined by mapping with nuclease S1), as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase.",
                        "In some embodiments, the disclosed polynucleotides are operably connected to the promoter. As used herein, a polynucleotide is \u201coperably connected\u201d or \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with a second polynucleotide sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a polynucleotide if the promoter is connected to the polynucleotide such that it may effect transcription of the polynucleotides. Heterologous promoters useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, constitutive, inducible, temporally-regulated, developmentally regulated, chemically regulated, tissue-preferred and tissue-specific promoters. The heterologous promoter may be a plant, animal, bacterial, fungal, or synthetic promoter.",

The term \u201cvector\u201d is intended to refer to a polynucleotide capable of transporting another polynucleotide to which it has been linked. In some embodiments, the vector may be a \u201cplasmid,\u201d which refers to a circular double-stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome, such as some viral vectors or transposons, such as lentiviral vectors. Vectors may carry genetic elements, such as those that confer resistance to certain drugs or chemicals.",

Suitable \u201ccells\u201d that may be used in accordance with the present invention include eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. Suitable eukaryotic cells include, without limitation, plant cells, fungal cells, and animal cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells include, without limitation, gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species.",

As described herein, the transient reporter-containing compositions and methods of their use enable enrichment of base edited cells.",
                        "In some cases, the kit comprises a one or more vectors comprising nucleic acid sequences that encode elements that perform base editing and the transient reporter of base editing enrichment. In some cases, the composition comprises one or more vectors comprising a first nucleic acid encoding one or more reporter proteins, wherein the first nucleic acid includes a PAM site adjacent to a base that when edited causes a change in a function or characteristic of the one or more reporter proteins, a second nucleic acid sequence encoding a base editing targeting cassette (preferably comprising one or more sgRNAs and protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) directed to the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the reporter protein), a third nucleic acid sequence encoding a base editing targeting cassette (preferably comprising one or more sgRNAs and protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) directed to a nucleic acid sequence of interest), and a fourth nucleic acid sequence encoding a base editor,",
                        "Any appropriate base editor capable of single nucleotide modifications without a need for double stranded DNA breaks can be used. In some cases, the base editor is a cytidine deaminase base editor (CBE) or adenine base editor (ABE). CBEs and ABEs install C\u2022G-to-T\u2022A and A\u2022T-to-G\u2022C transitions, respectively, and have been successfully used in many cell types including mammalian cells and plant cells. Cytidine deaminase base editors convert cytidine to uridine within a small editing window near the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site. Uridine is subsequently converted to thymidine through base excision repair, creating a C-to-T conversion (or G-to-A on the opposite strand). ABEs can convert adenine into inosine through deamination in any ABE protospacer (e.g. NGG, NG, and more) adjacent motif. The editing window will vary based on the type of base editor. For instance, the editing window for ABE is typically 12 to 17 nucleotides upstream of the ABE protospacer adjacent motif.",
                        "In some cases, the base editor is a prime editor. Prime editors are engineered Cas9 nickase-reverse transcriptase (RT) fusion proteins. When used in combination with prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) that encode the desired edit, prime editors can edit bases in plant and animal cells without donor DNA or double-strand breaks. Unlike CBEs and ABE, prime editors are able to introduce point mutations, insertions, deletions, and all 12 possible base-to-base conversions. See Anzalone et al., i 576:149-157 (2019).",
                        "In some cases, the base editor is a Cas9-mediated adenosine base editor (referred to herein as \u201cXMAS\u201d). As described in Example 3, use of a Cas9-mediated adenosine base editor according to the methods of this disclosure introduces an A-to-G conversion. When a Cas9-mediated adenosine base editor used, for example, to target a TGA stop codon located between coding sequence for two different reporter proteins, the A-to-G conversion changes the TGA stop codon to TGG. Accordingly, expression of both reporter proteins allows for the real-time detection of adenosine base editing.",
                        "In some cases, the base editor is a dual adenine and cytosine base editor (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9-based synchronous programmable adenine and cytosine editor (SPACE), a codon-optimized fusion of cytosine deaminase PmCDA1, adenosine deaminase TadA, and a Cas9 nickase (Target-ACEmax), or a fusion of both adenine and cytosine deaminases with a Cas9 nickase (A&C-BEmax). When a dual editor is used, both C-T and A-G conversions happen simultaneously without the need for two base editor constructs.",
                        "In some cases, the base editor is any enzyme capable of modifying nucleobases is fused to a catalytically inactivated or impaired zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), or a transcription activator like effector (TALE). A ZF or TALE is designed to bind to a specific region of DNA, eliminating the potentially narrow editing window found with CRISPR systems.",
                        "In the context of the present disclosure, the following abbreviations for the commonly occurring nucleic acid bases are used. \u201cA\u201d refers to adenosine, \u201cC\u201d refers to cytosine, \u201cG\u201d refers to guanosine, \u201cT\u201d refers to thymidine, and \u201cU\u201d refers to uridine.",
                        "The reporter protein can be any detectable protein (e.g., detectable by fluorescence, color, bioluminescence indirect reporter system) for which a single base-to-base conversion or, in some cases, an insertion or deletion resulting in an observable change in the detectable protein. For example, the reporter protein can comprise a single nucleotide variation relative to the wild-type reporter protein. When a base-to-base conversion or other mutation is introduced into sequence encoding the reporter protein by base editing, the expressed reporter protein exhibits a detectable change (e.g., change in emitted fluorescent, change in color, change by way of indirect reporter) relative to the non-edited reporter protein. Examples of reporter proteins appropriate for this disclosure include, without limitation, fluorescent proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP) and variants thereof, blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and variants thereof, red fluorescent protein (RFP) and variants thereof), luciferase and variants thereof, mCherry), \u03b2-galactosidase (lacZ), chloramphenyl acetyltransferase (CAT), \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS), secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), survival selection genes such as but not limited to antibiotic resistance, auxotrophies, flux redirection, toxin pumps, biosensors, reporter proteins that directly or indirectly produce or catalyze a colorimetric reaction, and those set forth in Table 1 below. In some cases, the reporter protein can be a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) variant that comprises a single nucleotide variation relative to the wild-type reporter protein. Referring to FIGS. 1A-1F, a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) variant can comprise a histidine at amino acid position 66 (numbered relative to SEQ ID NO:1) where the histidine is encoded by a C-A-C codon. In some cases, the reporter protein is a mutated, inactive form of luciferase. In such cases, it is advantageous to design a nucleic acid encoding the mutant luciferase such that a single base-to-base conversion or other genetic modification will introduce a corrective edit, resulting in expression of an active luciferase enzyme. In other embodiments the reporter protein is a fusion protein of two fluorescent proteins linked via a linker including at least one stop codon and a PAM site positioned to allow targeting and editing of the stop codon into a codon coding for an amino acid. Base editing allows for translation of the second reporter in the fusion protein and expression of the second reporter. The linker is positioned between the two reporter proteins such that expression of the reporter construct comprising the fusion protein in a cell results in expression of only the first reporter protein in the fusion protein. Once the polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein is edited, then both the first and second reporter will be detected. In this case the first reporter may be used as a measure of transfection efficiency and the second may be used to monitor and select for gene edited cells.",
                        "In some cases, the nucleic acid sequence that encodes a base editing cassette comprises a sgRNA adjacent to (e.g., located 5\u2032 to) a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), where the sgRNA comprises a protospacer sequence and targets a portion of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the reporter protein for base editing. As used herein, the term \u201cbase editing cassette\u201d refers to an expression cassette or framework comprising nucleic acid sequence encoding a RNA oligonucleotide containing, in some cases, 18-22 base pairs (the single guide RNA or \u201csgRNA\u201d) and PAM sequence. As used herein, a \u201csingle guide RNA\u201d (sgRNA) is nucleotide sequence that is complementary to at least a portion of a target nucleic acid to be genetically modified by a base editor. Generally, a sgRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence that is partially or wholly complementary to a target sequence (such as a target genomic sequence or sequence in an expression vector) and comprises a target base pair. A gRNA target site also comprises a PAM located immediately downstream from the target site. In some cases, the PAM is a S. pyogenes Cas9 PAM \u2018NGG.\u2019 The PAM sequence may vary if other Cas9 variants are used. For some embodiments, the sgRNA preferably comprises a sequence of at least 10 contiguous nucleotides, and often a sequence of 18-22 contiguous nucleotides or more. In some embodiments, a sgRNA molecule can be from 20 to 300 or more bases in length, or more. In certain embodiments, a sgRNA molecule can be from 20 to 300 bases in length, or 20 to 120 bases, or 30 to 50 bases, or 39 to 46 bases. In some cases, no sgRNA is needed.",

Thus, a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.",

Depending on the PAM specificity and editing window configured in the base editing cassettes, the methods can be used in conjunction with any base editors or base editor variants. For instance, the PAM sequence and edit distance can be modified to match the editing specificity and window of the new base editor. Such modifications are straightforward to achieve with the BFP vector using TREE, or the stop codon between RFP and GFP using BIG-TREE.",

A promoter, generally, is a region of nucleic acid that initiates transcription of a nucleic acid encoding a product. A promoter may be located upstream (e.g., 0 bp to \u2212100 bp, \u221230 bp, \u221275 bp, or \u221290 bp) from the transcriptional start site of a nucleic acid encoding a product, or a transcription start site may be located within a promoter. A promoter may have a length of 100-1000 nucleotide base pairs, or 50-2000 nucleotide base pairs. In some embodiments, promoters have a length of at least 2 kilobases (e.g., 2-5 kb, 2-4 kb, or 2-3 kb). The term \u201cexpression\u201d as used herein is defined as the transcription and/or translation of a particular nucleotide sequence driven by its promoter. As used herein, the term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to the situation in which a first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with a second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Operably linked DNA sequences may be in close proximity or contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, in the same reading frame. As exemplified in FIG. 1B, the promoter can be human EF1a promoter, which is a strong constitutively active promoter, however other promoters can be used. In some cases the promoter is an inducible promoter or a cell-type specific promoter. Examples of base editing in different organisms and plus DOI citations for each example are set forth in Table 2.",

Large numbers of suitable vectors are known to those of skill in the art and commercially available. Preferred vectors are episomal vectors, which are capable of autonomous replication due to the presence of an origin of replication. Preferably, vectors of the base editing compositions described herein are episomal vectors, meaning they are capable of autonomous replication due to the presence of an origin of replication.

In some cases, methods described herein can be performed using a vector comprising a multiplex-targeting sgRNAs. In such cases, a first nucleic acid sequence encodes a sgRNA for base editing in the reporter protein, and a second, third, fourth, etc. nucleic acid sequence encodes a sgRNA for a genomic target site. When introduced into a cell with nucleic acid sequences encoding the base editor and reporter protein, it is possible to base edit two or more genomic target sites and also promote a base-to-base conversion or other genetic modification that yields a detectable change in fluorescent emission or color of the transient reporter protein. The Examples demonstrate successful base editing at two or more genomic target sites and plus introduction of a C-to-T conversion in nucleic acid sequence encoding a BFP variant, thus resulting in a shift in fluorescent emission spectra from BFP to GFP as described herein. In this manner, base-edited cells can be sorted and selected based on fluorescence emission spectra or other detectable signals.

Where the introducing involves electroporation (e.g., nucleofection), a polynucleotide (e.g., a plasmid, a single stranded DNA, a minicircle DNA, RNA) is electroporated into a target cell. Vectors are useful for introducing DNA encoding molecules into cells. Any appropriate delivery vector can be used with the methods described herein. For example, delivery vectors include exosomes, viruses (viral vectors), and viral particles. Preferably, the delivery vector is a viral vector, such as a lenti- or baculo- or preferably adeno-viral/adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, but other non-viral means of delivery are known (such as yeast systems, microvesicles, gene guns/means of attaching vectors to gold nanoparticles).

                                "Current approaches to identify cell populations that have been modified with deaminase base editing technologies are inefficient and rely on downstream sequencing techniques. In this example, a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) that converts to green fluorescent protein (GFP) upon a C-to-T substitution was used as an assay to report directly on base editing activity within a cell. Using this assay, various base editing transfection parameters and delivery strategies were developed. Moreover, this assay was used in conjunction with flow cytometry to develop a transient reporter for editing enrichment (TREE) to efficiently purify base-edited cell populations. Compared to conventional cell enrichment strategies that employ reporters of transfection (RoT), TREE significantly improved the editing efficiency at multiple independent loci, with efficiencies approaching 80%. In addition, the BFP-to-GFP conversion assay was employed to develop base editor vector design for human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), a cell type that is resistant to genome editing and in which modification via base editors has not been previously reported. At last, using these optimized vectors in the context of TREE allowed for the highly efficient editing of hPSCs. It is envisioned that TREE is a readily adoptable method to facilitate base editing applications in synthetic biology, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine.",

                                "To establish that BFP to GFP conversion could be used as the basis for an assay to detect genomic base editing, we utilized a BFP mutant that converts to a GFP upon a C-to-T nucleotide conversion (FIG. 1A). Briefly, this BFP mutant (BFPH66) contains a histidine at the 66th amino acid position encoded by a \u2018CAC\u2019 codon. The C-to-T conversion of that codon to \u2018TAC\u2019 or \u2018TAT\u2019 will result in an amino acid change from a histidine to a tyrosine. In turn, this amino acid change will cause a shift of the emission spectra of the resultant protein generating a GFP variant (GFPY66). Because the optimal nucleotide base editing window is typically 12-18 nt upstream from the PAM, we also placed a S. pyogenes Cas9 PAM \u2018NGG\u2019 in a position that would enable base editing to occur at the target \u2018CAC\u2019 codon. To verify the utility of this fluorescent protein to report on base editing activity, we cloned the BFP coding sequence into a vector with a human EF1a promoter to drive expression (pEF-BFP; FIG. 1B). In addition, we designed a sgRNA vector [sg(BG)] that would direct the base editing machinery to the target \u2018CAC\u2019 codon resulting in a C-to-T conversion and the subsequent amino acid change of histidine to tyrosine at the 66th amino acid position (FIG. 1A). HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pEF-BFP, a base editing vector (pCMV-BE4-Gam) and sg(BG) or a control non-targeting sgRNA [sg(NT)]. Fluorescent microscopy (FIG. 1C) and flow cytometry (FIG. 1D) revealed that targeting pEF-BFP with sg(BG) resulted in the generation of BFP/GFP double positive cells. However, targeting pEF-BFP with sg(NT) did not result in the generation of any BFP/GFP positive cells. To confirm GFP expression was a consequence of direct editing of the target codon in pEF-BFP, we implemented a strategy to isolate and detect editing of episomal DNA after transfection (v 1E). Sanger sequencing of isolated pEF-BFP DNA established that editing had occurred at the target \u2018CAC\u2019 codon in pEF-BFP resulting in a change to \u2018TAC\u2019 or \u2018TAT\u2019 reflected in the GFP emission (FIG. 1F). Overall, these results confirm that the GFP-to-BFP conversion corresponds to C-to-T conversion at targeted base editing sites.",
                                "Next, we wanted to establish that the BFP-to-GFP conversion would correlate with base-editing efficiency at achromosomal locus. Tothat end, we employed a HEK293 cell line (herein referred to as HEK293-BFP) in which BFPH66 was stably integrated into a known genomic location (C10RF228; FIG. 2A). We then used this line to enable the analysis of the efficiency of base editing genomic loci (FIG. 2B). To first assess plasmid-based base editing, we co-transfected pCMV-BE4-Gam and sg(BG) plasmid DNA in HEK293-BFP cells. Targeting with sg(BG), but not sg(NT), resulted in generation of detectable GFP+ cells, indicating successful base editing at the targeted genomic loci (FIG. 2C). Moreover, we were able to use this assay to systematically evaluate genomicbase editing efficiencies using a range of pCMV-BE4-Gam plasmid amounts at varying ratios with the sg(BG) vector (FIG. 2D). This analysis revealed that base editing plasmid concentration and base editor to sgRNA ratios could enhance genomic base editing efficiencies approximately 2-fold. Because ribonucleo-protein (RNP) complex-based strategies have been previously shown as an attractive alternative to plasmid-based Cas9 genome engineering, we also utilized BFP-to-GFP conversion as an assay to optimize RNP-driven base editing. As such, we generated RNPs through the in vitro complexing of purified base editing protein with sg(BG) or sg(NT) (FIG. 2E). Our initial analysis revealed that RNP delivery using the same transfection reagent that was used for plasmid delivery of the base editor (i.e., Lipofectamine\u2122 3000) did not result in substantial BFP-to-GFP conversion (FIG. 2F). In turn, we utilized BFP-to-GFP to evaluate various commercially available transfection reagents to optimize RNP delivery forbase editing applications. From this analysis, we were able to determine that Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 allowed for a>4-fold increase in genomic base editing efficiency compared to other commercially available reagents such as Lipofectamine\u2122 and CRISPRMAX (FIG. 2F). Despite this, RNP-driven delivery was about 4-fold less efficient in genomic base editing compared to plasmid delivery. Thus, for the remainder of this example we proceeded with plasmid delivery of base editors. Nonetheless, this collective data demonstrates that BFP-to-GFP conversion correlates to base editing efficiency at genomic loci. Moreover, this approach allows for the facile and systematic optimization of base editing in human cells using plasmid- and RNP-based approaches.",
                                "Development of Transient Reporter for Editing Enrichment (TREE) to Identify and Efficiently Isolate Base-Edited Cell Populations",
                                "Conventional base editing approaches that use reporters of transfection (herein abbreviated as RoT) only report on the efficiency of plasmid delivery to a cell but not directly on the efficiency of base editing within these cells. As such, it was hypothesized that we BFP-to-GFP conversion, which directly correlates to base editing activity within a cell, could be employed as a TREE to allow for the identification and enrichment of cells in which targeted genomic base editing had occurred. To facilitate this, we engineered a dual-targeting sgRNA (pDT-sgRNA) vector that contains both sg(BG) and a sgRNA fora genomic target pite [sg(TS)](FIG. 3A). Moreover, the pDT-sgRNA vector was designed to allow for the facile cloning of new target sites via BbsI restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of sg(TS) oligonucleotides (FIG. 3A). Accordingly, we designed pDT-sgRNA vectors with sequences targeting three genomic locations (Sites 1-3). To utilize TREE for enrichment of cells that have been edited at specific loci, we co-transfected these pDT-sgRNA vectors with pEF-BFP and pCMV-BE4-Gam into HEK293 cells using the optimized base editing parameters identified using the BFP-to-GFP conversion assay (FIG. 3B). Flow cytometry was then used to isolate GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. For comparison, we used a conventional RoT as a strategy to enrich for edited cell populations (FIG. 3C). Specifically, after co-transfecting HEK293 cells with pEF-GFP and sg(TS) plasmids, we used flow cytometry to sort for GFP-positive and -negative cell populations. Flow cytometry analysis of cells in which TREE was applied confirmed the presence of BFP and GFP-positive cell populations indicative of active base editing (FIG. 3D). Importantly, in these cell populations there was also a significant percentage of cells that were BFP-positive but GFP-negative, suggesting that isolating cell populations exclusively based upon a reporter of transfection would significantly limit the enrichment of edited cells. To confirm this, we performed Sanger sequencing of the targeted genomic sites in GFP-positive, GFP-negative and unsorted cell populations isolated from TREE and RoT approaches (FIG. 3E and FIG. 19). As expected, GFP-positive cells isolated using both TREE- and RoT-based strategies were enriched for edited cells when com-pared to GFP-negative and unsorted cell populations. We found that base editing efficiency at these three target loci in HEK293 cells using RoT-based approaches was similar to those reported previously (Table 11). Importantly, this analysis also revealed across all three targeted sites that GFP-positive cells isolated via TREE had a statistically significant higher frequency of base editing than GFP-positive cells isolated using traditional RoT approaches.",
                                "Because of the success of targeting these loci, it was investigated if TREE could be utilized to target additional genomic sites that display very low editing efficiency when traditional RoT approaches are applied. One such example is the APOE locus, a well-established risk factor associated with altered probability of sporadic Alzheimer's disease onset. Human APOE has three major isoforms, ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4, which differ by two amino acid substitutions at positions 112 and 158 in exon 4-ApoE2 (Cys112, Cys158), ApoE3 (Cys112, Arg158), ApoE4 (Arg112, Arg158). Attempts to use base editing to convert ApoE3 to ApoE2 by targeting the APOE(R158) locus revealed undetectable levels of editing in unsorted cell populations despite similar transfection efficiencies when other genomic sites (Sites 1-3) were targeted (FIG. 20). In addition, our attempts to use RoT-based methods in HEK293 cells to convert ApoE3 to ApoE2 by targeting the APOE(R158) locus revealed very low levels of editing in GFP+ isolated cells (FIG. 20B), further establishing the APOE(R158) locus as recalcitrant to genomic editing. Then, TREE-based methods were used to edit this same loci in HEK293 cells by co-transfecting pEF-BFP, pCMV-BE4-Gam and pDT-sgRNA with a sg(TS) targeting the APOE(R158) locus. As expected, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the transfection efficiency when TREE was used to target the APOE(R158) locus was similar to when TREE was used to target other genomic sites (FIG. 20C). In addition, despite these similarities in transfection efficiencies, there was no detectable editing in the unsorted cell populations using TREE to target the APOE(R158) locus, thereby confirming the difficulty in editing this genomic location (FIG. 20D). However, unlike in GFP-positive isolated using RoT methods, GFP-positive cells purified using TREE methods displayed a high level of base editing at the APOE(R158) locus (FIG. 20E). Together, these results demonstrate that TREE can not only provide for a higher level of enrichment of base-edited cell populations compared to conventional RoT strategies but also can allow for isolation of base-edited cells at genomic loci that were not previously achievable with traditional RoT approaches.",
                                "At last, we wanted to confirm that the fluorescent signal associated with cells isolated by TREE was transient. To that end, we measured the long-term fluorescence of GFP-positive cells purified after TREE-based editing (FIG. 21A). Notably, analysis of these cells by fluorescent microscopy (FIG. 21B) and flow cytometry (FIG. 21C) revealed no long-term detectable GFP signal, verifying that the TREE fluorescent output is indeed transient in nature.",
                                "Multiplex Base-Editing Using TREE",
                                "It was further investigated whether TREE could be utilized in con-junction with multiplexed genome engineering strategies. To accomplish this, we generated a multi-targeted vector (pMT-sgRNA) that contains sg(BG) as well as sgRNA for genomic targets Sites 1-3 (FIG. 4A). In a similar manner to when TREE was employed to target a single locus, we utilized TREE to simultaneously target multiple genomic sites by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with pMT-sgRNA, pEF-BFP and pCMV-BE4-Gam. In parallel, we used a RoT-based approach by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with pMT-sgRNA, pEF-GFP and pCMV-BE4-Gam. After 48 h, GFP-negative and GFP-positive cells were isolated using flow cytometry (FIG. 22A). Along similar lines to single locus targeting, Sanger sequencing ofthe multiplex targeted genomic sites in GFP-positive cell populations isolated from TREE and RoT approaches revealed that TREE allowed for statistically significant higher frequency of base editing than RoT approaches (FIG. 4B and FIG. 22B). Importantly, this analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in editing efficiency when TREE was used to target these sites individually or a multiplexed manner (FIG. 22C). Finally, we wanted to determine if TREE increased the likelihood of C-to-T conversions at off-target loci. Therefore, in GFP-positive cell populations isolated from TREE and RoT approaches we PCR-amplified and Sanger sequenced the top predicted off-target loci for the sgRNA sequences used for multiplexed editing. Overall, quantification of the Sanger chromatographs by EditR revealed no observable C-to-T conversions at these off-target loci in either GFP-positive cells isolated with TREE- or RoT-based strategies when compared to that of untransfected cells (FIG. 23).",
                                "Sanger sequencing that was performed on bulk sorted GFP-positive cells suggested that multiplex editing in conjunction with TREE could result in multiplexed editing in the same cell. To confirm that this indeed occurred, we again used our multi-targeting vector (pMT-sgRNA) in conjunction with TREE to simultaneously target genomic Sites 1-3 in HEK293 cells. We then sorted single GFP-positive cells into a 96-well plate. After expansion, Sanger sequencing of the multiplexed genomic sites was performed on a total of 40 clones. This analysis revealed that 36 out of the 40 clones had base editing at more than one genomic site (FIG. 4C). Remarkably, this analysis revealed that almost 80% of the isolated clones (31 out of 40) had biallelic conversions at all three genomic loci.",
                                "One of the caveats of all base-editing approaches, regardless if RoT- or TREE-based enrichment strategies are employed, is that base editors can potentially edit non-target Cs that are located in an 6 nt window (termed the editing window) within the protospacer. As a consequence, this could potentially limit the application of base editing approaches in which conversion of non-target Cs result in a non-silent mutation or other phenotypic changes. To that end, we wanted to determine if any of our clones contained edits exclusively at the target C and not any other Cs within the editing window. Indeed, we identified a number of clones in which at genomic Site 2 and Site 3 modification only occurred at the target C (FIG. 24). Interestingly, we did not identify any clones in which at genomic Site 1 such exclusive modification of the target C occurred. We speculate that because another C occurs immediately adjacent to this target C, that such exclusive modification will require the use of recently published site-specific editors that allow for single nucleotide changes free from off-targeting conversions within the editing window.",
                                "TREE Allows for Highly Efficient Editing in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSCs)",
                                "Single base pair modification in hPSCs via CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB followed by HDR suffers from low efficiencies. In addition, genomic modification of hPSCs using deaminase-based DNA base editor has yet to be reported. Therefore, we wanted to investigate if TREE could be utilized to efficiently edit specific loci in hPSCs. Hence, we co-transfected pEF-BFP and pCMV-BE4-Gam into hPSCs using a transfection reagent (Lipofectamine\u2122 Stem) that had been previously used by others for the efficient delivery of Cas9-related plasmids to hPSCs. Surprisingly, we did not observe many GFP-positive cells in these cell populations (FIG. 5A and FIG. 25A). As such, we performed similar experiments in which we employed a more recently published, higher efficiency base editor, AncBE4max (herein referred to AncBE4). Briefly, AncBE4 is an improved version of BE4 that has been codon optimized for expression and contains an ancestral reconstructed deaminase to increase base editing efficiency at tar-get loci. Nonetheless, similar to when BE4-Gam was utilized, we observed very few GFP-positive cells when An-cBE4 was used (FIG. 25A). Because previous reports have suggested that the CMV promoter is inefficient for transgene expression in pluripotent stem cells, we replaced the promoter driving base editor expression with EF1a. When hPSCs were co-transfected with pEF-BE4-Gam or pEF-AncBE4 as well as pEF-BFP and sg(BG), a significant number of GFP-positive cells were observed (FIG. 5A). Using the pEF-AncBE4 vector, we also developed editing efficiency in hPSCs by using a range of base editor amount at varying ratio with sg(BG) (FIG. 25B). Similar to our experiments with HEK293 cells, this analysis revealed that base editing efficiencies were significantly affected by these parameters. Interestingly, the most optimal parameters in hPSCs differed from those identified in HEK293 cells (FIG. 2D) highlighting the utility of this assay to evaluate these variables. Using these base editing vector designs, we applied TREE to target a genomic loci in hPSCs by co-transfecting pEF-BE4-Gam/pEF-AncBE4, pEF-BFP and pDT-sgRNA (with a sg(TS) targeting site 1) (FIG. 5B). In turn, flow cytometry was used to isolate GFP-positive and -negative cell populations (FIG. 5C). Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was performed on the targeted genomic site in GFP-positive, GFP-negative and unsorted cell populations isolated from TREE and RoT approaches in which pEF-BE4-Gam and pEF-AncBE4 was used (FIG. 25C). This analysis demonstrated that GFP-positive hPSCs isolated via TREE had a statistically significant higher frequency of base editing than GFP-positive hPSCs isolated using traditional RoT approaches (FIG. 5D). In addition, TREE employed with the pEF-AncBE4 vector allowed for the efficient modification of the difficult to edit APOE(R158) locus (FIG. 7D-S7E).",
                                "Similar to our work with HEK293 cells, we wanted to confirm that the fluorescent output of TREE was transient in nature. In that regard, we measured the fluorescence of GFP-positive hPSCs isolated after TREE-based editing. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that after 2 weeks of culture there was no detectable GFP signal (FIG. 26), demonstrating that the fluorescent signal associated with hPSCs purified by TREE was transient.",
                                "Collectively, although this data demonstrates that TREE can be utilized for the efficient base editing of hPSCs, one of the caveats of all base editing approaches is the C-to-T conversion of non-target Cs within the editing window. Indeed, the Sanger sequencing analysis of GFP-positive populations isolated from TREE revealed editing of such non-target Cs when either Site 1 (FIG. 25C) or the APOE(R158)(FIG. 25E) locus was targeted in hPSCs. As such, to determine whether TREE allowed allelic outcomes in which targeting only occurred at the desired C, we performed NGS of PCR amplicons of Site 1 and APOE(R158) in GFP-positive cells purified using TREE. This analysis revealed at both these loci a very modest number of allelic outcomes in which base editing occurred exclusively at the target C, free from con-founding C-to-T conversions at other sites within the targeting window (FIG. 27). Instead, the most common editing outcome was one in which the majority of the Cs in the editing window were converted to Ts (FIG. 27). This suggests that for future applications which require a higher percentage of allelic outcomes where editing occurs only at the target C the use of recently published base editors that have a narrower editing window will be required. Nonetheless, this collective data demonstrates the broad utility of TREE to allow for the efficient editing in hPSCs."

                                "Since the first deaminase base editor was developed by Komor et al., multiple additional base-editing technologies have been rapidly developed with various endonucleases, deaminases, targeting windows and PAM specificities. Application of these emerging base editors to new cell types requires a slow, iterative process in which various base editing parameters are tested and editing efficiency is assessed through downstream sequencing methods. Additionally, as demonstrated herein, transfection efficiency does not precisely correlate with editing efficiency, so reporters of transfection do not provide accurate information about the efficacy of various base editing strategies. Here, it is described how BFP-to-GFP conversion and TREE can be utilized to rapidly optimize various factors that influence base editing efficiency, including base editor plasmid concentration and design as well as base editor to sgRNA ratios. In fact, these data show that these parameters are cell line-specific, demonstrating the advantage of TREE to allow for the high-throughput evaluation of base editing approaches. In the future, TREE may be used in the context of high-throughput screening to identify small molecules to further enhance base editing efficiency in a manner similar to that which has been previously achieved with CRISPR-mediated HDR approaches.",
                                "It has been shown that CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering is compatible with a variety of delivery methods (e.g., lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation) and expression systems (e.g., plasmid DNA, Cas9-gRNA ribonucleo-protein complexes [RNP]), each with advantages and dis-advantages that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere. In this example, we employed lipid-based delivery reagents that have been previously employed by others for the CRISPR/Cas9-based editing of HEK293 cells (Lipofectamine 3000) and hPSCs (Lipofectamine Stem). Given TREE's ease of use and readily detectable fluorescent output we anticipate that TREE can be employed with whatever transfection method that is preferred by the end user. For instance, the data presented here demonstrated that the TREE base editing assay was compatible with both plasmid and RNP approaches. Although we observed that the overall genomic base editing efficiency of RNP-based expression was lower than that of lipid-based expression, we provide proof-of-principle that TREE can be employed in future applications where the advantages of RNPs are desirable.",
                                "One potential limitation of the use of the plasmid DNA expression systems in the context of TREE approaches is random integration of all or part of the plasmid DNA into the genome of targesd cells. It should be noted that it has been reported by others that the stable integration of circular plasmid DNA into the host genome is infrequent, especially for cells such as hPSCs where it has been reported on the order of 1 per 1\u00d7105 cells. Indeed, as it relates to potential integration of the pEF-BFP plasmid, we demonstrate that the fluorescent output of TREE is transient in both HEK293 cells and hPSCs, suggesting that this plasmid does not integrate into the genome. As it relates to the integration of the base editing and sgRNA plasmids, it has been shown by others in CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering that the Cas9 and sgRNA plasmids can be integrated at on- and off-target sites. However, we speculate that because base editors do not introduce DSBs the integration of these plasmids into the genome would be infrequent. In fact, we did not observe any integration of these plasmids when Sanger sequencing or NGS was performed at the on- or off-target sites. Moving forward, undesirable insertions of plasmid DNA sequences at target sites can be detected using PCR-based methods followed by Sanger sequencing or NGS of the resultant amplicons. On the other hand, similar insertions at off-target or random genomic sites are difficult to detect and will require the use of more comprehensive techniques such as whole genome sequencing.",
                                "Human cell models are critical for elucidating the mechanisms of disease progression as well as identifying and testing potential therapeutic interventions. Because a high percentage of human diseases are due to single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs), base editors can allow for the precise engineering of in vitro models of human disease. Here we provide proof-of-principle that TREE can be employed to edit disease-relevant loci. Specifically, we demonstrate that TREE enables for the enrichment of cells that had been edited at the APOE(R158) locus, a gene associated with altered risk of Alzheimer's disease onset. Notably, conventional RoT-based methods did not allow for significant enrichment of edited cells at this same refractory locus. In addition, because many human diseases are multigenetic disorders that are a result of complex gene interactions, we also investigated the ability of TREE to be utilized in multiplexed genome engineering applications. By using a multi-targeted vector, we demonstrated that compared to RoT-based methods TREE resulted in a significantly higher level of cells enriched for simultaneous editing at multiple independent loci. In fact, we demonstrated that through analysis of single cell clones that 90% of the clones had simultaneous base editing at more than one genomic site and almost 80% of the clones had biallelic conversions at all three targeted loci. In this vein, TREE provides a highly efficient method for generating cell-based models of multigenic diseases.",
                                "Many immortalized cell lines, such as HEK293s, are aneuploid with unknown mutations and dosage at key disease-relevant genes. Alternatively, hPSCs, which have a normal euploid karyotype and the potential to differentiate into all cell types of the mature adult body, represent an attractive alternative to immortalized cell lines for disease modeling and drug screening applications. In particular, the ability to use gene editing technologies to generate isogenic hPSC lines that differ only with respect to disease mutations has great potential as it relates to precisely defining genotype to phenotype relationships. The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system has the potential to allow for precise genetic modifications in hPSCs through the introduction of site-specific DSBs. Although previous reports demonstrate that introduction of DSB via CRISPR/Cas9 significantly improves the ability to obtain knock out cell lines from hPSCs by the NHEJ pathway, single base modification using CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB followed by HDR is extremely inefficient (1-2% of sequenced colonies in which one allele is targeted and <1% where both alleles are targeted. Recently, it has been reported that co-delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and a puromycin selection cassette followed by transient puromycin selection can increase the HDR-mediated genome engineering in hPSCs However, these strategies rely on the introduction of DSBs, which in pluripotent stem cells can lead to large deletions and complex chromosomal rearrangements, significant cytotoxicity and increased acquisition of p53 mutations. In addition, it has been shown that the use of antibiotic selection, even in a transient manner, may lead to the se-lection of hPSCs, with chromosomal abnormalities. Yet, to our knowledge, base editors, which do not have these same limitations as CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB followed by HDR, have not previously been used with hPSCs. In fact, our initial attempts to apply base editors in the context of both RoT- and TREE-based approaches with hPSCs did not allow for observable modification of target loci. Instead, by replacing the standard CMV promoter in the base editing plasmids with an EF1a promoter, we were able to achieve modification of genomic sites using both RoT- and TREE-centered methods. However, TREE allowed for significantly higher enrichment of edited hPSCs when com-pared to RoT isolation strategies. We contend that the use of TREE with hPSCs will significantly advance the use of these cells in disease modeling, drug screening, and cell-based therapies.",
                                "Despite their tremendous potential in a variety of downstream applications, base editing approaches have a few of caveats that should be noted, regardless of whether RoT- or TREE-based enrichment strategies are employed. First, as is the case with all Cas9-directed genome editing approaches, is the potential for genome modification at off-target loci. In this work, GFP-positive cells isolated via TREE did not display untargeted C-to-T conversions at the off-target genomic loci examined. Recently, it has been reported that base editors can induce site-specific inosine formation on RNA. Accordingly, in the future, the effect of TREE-based approaches on unwanted RNA modifications should be examined. Another limitation of base editing methods is modification of additional C nucleotides that are in close proximity to the target C. In fact, some base editors can cause C-to-T conversions at any Cs in up to a 9-nt window within the protospacer. Such C-to-T modifications could be especially problematic if they result in amino acid alterations during translation, induce epigenetic changes or cause other phenotypic changes in targeted cells. To that end, through clonal isolation and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis we identified that such exclusive modifications of the target C were achieved in both edited HEK293 cells or hPSCs that were enriched using TREE-based methods. It should be noted, though, that at genomic Site-1, where a C lies adjacent to the target C, allelic outcomes in which modification only occurred at the target C were rare events. Moving forward, modified base editors that have a narrow editing window could be easily employed with TREE to target such genomic loci that contain multiple Cs in close proximity to the target C.",
                                "In summary, these data demonstrate that TREE allows not only for the optimization of base editing strategies in the context of a variety of cell types and genomic locations but also the enrichment of cell populations to be utilized in variety of downstream applications. In particular, with the rate at which the genome editing field has been progressing over the past few years, TREE is a readily adoptable method that will expedite and improve tractability of single-nucleotide genome engineering methods.",

                                "Current CRISPR-targeted single-nucleotide modifications and subsequent isogenic cell line generation in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) require the introduction of deleterious double-stranded DNA breaks followed by inefficient homology-directed repair (HDR). This section describes the development of Cas9 deaminase base-editing technologies to co-target genomic loci and an episomal reporter to enable single-nucleotide genomic changes in hPSCs without HDR. Using this method, a base-edited isogenic hPSC line was generated using a transient reporter for editing enrichment (BIG-TREE) which allows for single-nucleotide editing efficiencies of >80% across multiple hPSC lines. Also described herein is use of BIG-TREE for efficient generation of loss-of-function hPSC lines via introduction of premature stop codons. Finally, BIG-TREE achieves efficient multiplex editing of hPSCs at several independent loci. These methods allow for the precise and efficient base editing of hPSCs for use in developmental biology, disease modeling, drug screening, and cell-based therapies.",

                                "It was previously demonstrated that the efficiency at which a base editor is delivered to a cell does not precisely correlate with editing efficiency at a genomic locus. To overcome this limitation, an assay was developed, termed transient reporter for editing enrichment (TREE) (Standage-Beier et al., 2019). TREE utilizes a BFP variant that converts to a GFP upon a C-to-T nucleotide change (Standage-Beier et al., 2019). More specifically, this BFP mutant contains a histidine at the 66th amino acid position encoded by a \u201cCAC\u201d codon. The C-to-T conversion of that codon to a \u201cTAC\u201d or \u201cTAT\u201d will cause an amino acid change from a histidine to a tyrosine as well as a shift in the emission spectra of the modified protein resulting in a GFP variant. Thus, co-transfection of cells with this BFP construct (pEF-BFP), a base editor (pEF-AncBE4max), and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the \u201cCAC\u201d codon, sg(BG), will result in a BFP-to-GFP conversion in which the base editor machinery is present and actively functioning. In addition, we found that this BFP-to-GFP conversion was highly predictive of the likelihood of base editing at genomic loci within the same cell that had been transfected with a sgRNA for a genomic target site, sg(TS).",
                                "This section describes efforts to extend this work to develop a rapid and efficient resource that uses TREE as the basis for the generation of clonal isogenic hPSC lines, termed base-edited isogenic hPSC line generation using a transient reporter for editing enrichment (BIG-TREE) (FIG. 6A). As proof-of-principle, we aimed to edit the APOE locus, a risk factor associated with altered probability of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) onset (Hauser and Ryan, 2013). Human APOE has three common isoforms that differ from each other by two amino acids at position 112 and 158 (APOE2=Cys112, Cys158; APOE3=Cys112, Arg158; APOE4=Arg112, Arg158). To this end, we transfected a non-demented control hPSC line (herein referred to as hPSC line 1) that has an APOE3/E3 genotype with pEF-BFP, pEF-AncBE4max, and a dual-targeting sgRNA (pDT-sgRNA) vector that contains both sg(BG) and a sgRNA for the APOE(R158) locus (FIG. 6B, top). Consequently, successful targeting of the APOE(R158) locus would result in C-to-T conversion that would cause a change from an APOE3 genotype (R158) to an APO E2 genotype (C158)(FIG. 6C). At 48 hours post transfection, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort single GFP-positive cells into 96-well plates. Clonal lines were then passaged and expanded over the course of 18 days prior to detailed analysis. First, genomic DNA was isolated from ten clones and the target region of the APOE locus, APOE(R158), was subject to Sanger sequencing after PCR amplification (FIG. 6C). Remarkably, this analysis revealed that 90% of the clones isolated had been edited, with seven of the clones having a homozygous and two of the clones having a heterozygous edit at the APOE(R158) locus (FIG. 6D). For comparison, we used a more conventional reporter of transfection (RoT) approach in which this same hPSC line was transfected with a plasmid in which a GFP and the AncBE4max base editor are driven by the same promoter, connected by a P2A post-translational self-cleavage peptide tag (pEFAncBE4max-P2A-GFP), as well as the same sgRNA for the APOE locus (FIG. 6B, bottom). In a manner analogous to that described for the BIG-TREE-based approach, single GFP-positive cells were then sorted into 96-well plates, expanded, and subject to Sanger sequencing. Analysis of ten clonal lines revealed this traditional RoT-based approach was significantly less efficient with only a single clone displaying a heterozygous edit at the target APOE(R158) locus (FIG. 6D). Given the large variability that exists between individual hPSC lines (Ortmann and Vallier, 2017), we wanted to determine the robustness of BIG-TREE to efficiently generate isogenic pairs in other independent hPSC lines. In this vein, we employed BIG-TREE to target the APOE (R158 locus) in two hPSC lines derived from patients with familial AD (FAD) (herein referred to hPSC line 2 and hPSC 3). Analysis of single cell clones by Sanger sequencing (FIG. 6C) revealed that across all three hPSC lines tested, over 80% (33/41 clones examined) had an edit at the APOE(R158) locus, and greater than 50% of those edits were homozygous in nature (FIG. 6E). Importantly, we did not observe the presence of indels at the target site in any of clones examined. Finally, one of the limitations of base editor techniques, regardless if BIG-TREE strategies are employed, is that base editors can induce changes in the protospacer at a C other than the target C within the editing window-termed bystander editing (FIG. 21A). Indeed, with respect to generating isogenic lines at the APOE(R158) locus, editing at these bystander Cs was a common occurrence (FIG. 21B). In fact, only one of the clones analyzed (line 2, clone 5) had a heterozygous edit exclusively at the target C and no other Cs within the editing window. However, it should be noted that these bystander edits did not alter the amino acid sequence.",
                                "We performed detailed phenotypic analysis on representative biallelic edited clones from each hPSC line. Overall, these clones had a normal euploid karyotype (FIG. 6F), characteristic hPSC morphology (FIG. 1G), high expression of key pluripotency markers (FIG. 1H), and demonstrated tri-lineage differentiation potential (FIG. 6I). In addition, off-target analysis was performed at the top predicted sites for sg(BG) as well as the sgRNA used to target the APOE(R158) locus. At all of the off-target sites analyzed, we did not observe any C-to-T conversions at these off-target loci (FIG. 29). Furthermore, indels were not identified at any of the off-target sites in clones analyzed. Finally, Sanger sequencing revealed that the AD-related mutations in the hPSC clones derived from the FAD lines were retained in the edited clones (FIG. 30). Taken together, this analysis reveals that TREE can be employed for the highly efficient generation of isogenic hPSCs across multiple independent cell lines.",
                                "BIG-TREE can be Utilized for the Engineering of Gene Knockout hPSC Lines",
                                "To date, engineering of hPSC loss-of-function lines using CRISPR-based approaches has involved the generation of Cas9-mediated DSBs followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which typically results in a frameshift mutation and introduction of a downstream premature stop codon. Because of the aforementioned caveats associated with such DSB-driven approaches, we wanted to determine if BIG-TREE could be utilized to generate gene knockout hPSC lines without the introduction of DSBs. Because base editors have not been utilized previously to generate loss-of-function in hPSCs, we first wanted to establish this proof-of-principle in HEK293 cells. First, to validate base editor targeted introduction of premature stop codons, we designed a series of sgRNAs targeting an mCherry cassette in an HEK293T line, which would lead to conversion of a \u201cCAG\u201d codon encoding for glutamine to a \u201cTAG\u201d stop codon (FIG. 31A). We observed loss of mCherry expression via fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry when targeting with sgRNAs (FIGS. 31B and 31C). In addition, we confirmed the targeted addition of stop codons by Sanger sequencing (FIG. 31D). Finally, this analysis revealed that loss of mCherry fluorescent signal was a direct consequence of introduction of a premature stop codon introduced into the genomically integrated mCherry cassette (FIG. 31E). Next, we sought to employ BIG-TREE to introduce premature stop codons in hPSCs at a disease relevant locus. To this end, we transfected hPSC line 1 with pEF-BFP, pEF-AncBE4max, and a dual-targeting sgRNA (pDT-sgRNA) vector that contained both sg(BG) and a sgRNA for the glutamine residue at amino acid position 39 in exon 3 of the APOE locus. Successful targeting would result in conversion of the glutamine encoding \u201cCAA\u201d codon to a premature \u201cTAA\u201d stop codon (FIG. 7A). Similar to as previously described, we isolated clonal cell lines established from single GFP-positive sorted cells. Analysis of these clones by Sanger sequencing (FIG. 7B) revealed that more than 80% of the clones had a stop codon introduced at the target site with greater than 50% of the edited clones displaying a biallelic modification (FIG. 7C). Importantly, none of the clones analyzed had indels at the same target site. Lastly, to demonstrate that introduction of a premature stop codon in exon 3 results in functional loss of APOE, we measured the amount of APOE in the conditioned media secreted by unedited and edited cells using ELISA. Compared with the unedited wild-type (Q39/Q39) cells that secreted robust amounts of APOE, cells in which a premature stop codon had been introduced into both alleles (X39/X39) did not secrete any detectable levels of APOE (FIG. 7D). Collectively, these data show that BIG-TREE enables efficient generation of loss-of-function hPSC lines through the introduction of premature stop codons.",
                                "BIG-TREE Enables High-Frequency, Multiplex Base Editing in hPSCs",
                                "Finally, we wanted to determine if BIG-TREE could be utilized with multiplexed genome modification methods to establish hPSC lines that had been simultaneously edited at multiple genomic locations. Accordingly, a multi-targeting vector (pMT-sgRNA) that contains sg(BG) as well as sgRNAs for three independent genomic target sites (FIG. 8A) was used. Analogous to when BIG-TREE was used to target a single genomic location, TREE was employed to simultaneously target multiple loci by co-transfecting hPSC line 1 with pMT-sgRNA, pEF-BFP, and pEF-AncBE4-max. Sanger sequencing was then performed on the multiplex targeted genomic sites in clonal hPSC lines derived from single GFP-positive cells (FIG. 8B). Along similar lines to when BIG-TREE was used to target a single genomic locus, Sanger sequencing revealed that more than 80% of clones had been targeted at all three sites with all clones displaying biallelic edits (FIG. 8C). Moreover, indels were not identified in any of the clones across all three target sites. Lastly, examination of potential bystander edits within the editing window (FIG. 28A) revealed a number of clones in which at genomic site 2 and site 3 modification only occurred at the target C and not any other Cs within the editing window (FIG. 28C). Specifically, of the ten clones that had homozygous edits at the target C at all three sites, two clones were free from bystander edits at both sites 2 and 3 (clones 1 and 2) and five clones were free from bystander edits at site 3 only (clones 3-7). However, it should be noted that we did not identify any clones in which at genomic site 1 such exclusive modification of the target C occurred. We speculate that because another C occurs immediately adjacent to this target C, that such exclusive modification is likely a rare event that will require site-specific base editors that allow for single-nucleotide changes free from bystander editing at adjacent nucleotides.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "In summary, we establish that BIG-TREE is a fast and efficient protocol for the generation of clonal isogenic hPSC lines with homozygous and heterozygous single base pair edits. Because the number of diseases that are a consequence of single point mutations, as well as the growing number of genomic variants of uncertain significance that have been identified through large-scale sequencing efforts, the ability to rapidly engineer isogenic hPSC lines will have a significant impact on the establishment of in vitro models to assess pathogenic risk and dissect disease-causing mechanisms. In addition, in this example, we demonstrate that BIG-TREE can be employed to generate effective loss-of-function cell lines through the introduction of premature stop codons. Currently, most CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches to generate gene knockouts involve the introduction of deleterious DSBs followed by NHEJ-mediated repair that results in frameshift and loss of gene function. As we describe in this example, the ability to rapidly generate gene knockouts without the need for DSBs will have important implications for the use of hPSCs to elucidate the function of specific genes in development and disease. Lastly, we establish that BIG-TREE can allow for the generation of clonal hPSC lines that have been simultaneously edited at multiple independent loci, an important consideration given that many diseases are polygenetic in nature. By comparison, conventional CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches are too inefficient in hPSCs to employ multiplexing editing strategies.",
                                "Since the first base editors were engineered, numerous additional base editors with targeting windows, editing efficiencies, PAM specificities, and deaminases have been generated. In the context of BIG-TREE, we employed AncBE4max, which displays a relatively high editing efficiency with low off-target activity. However, one of the limitations of AncBE4max is that it can induce C-to-T conversions at bystander Cs within the editing window. Although bystander editing was a common occurrence in our clonal populations, we did observe clones with exclusive modifications of the target C. More specifically, when generating isogenic lines edited at the APOE(R158) locus, we only isolated one clone that had a monoallelic edit exclusively at the target C. Nonetheless, all of the bystander edits that we observed at the APOE(R158) locus did not impact the amino acid sequence, mitigating the impact on the downstream application of these hPSC lines. With regard to the multiplex editing, we did observe several clones that were free from bystander edits at genomic sites 2 and 3. However, at genomic site 1, where a C is present in the base pair position directly next to the target C, we did not isolate any clones where modification only occurred at the target C. In the future, given the ease of use, we anticipate that utilizing BIG-TREE with these other base editor variants with a narrow editing window will be easily achieved. In this regard, the end-user can select to employ such base editors with a more stringent editing window if editing at a bystander C is not tolerable (e.g., results in changes in the amino acid coding sequence).",
                                "In general, there are several enabling aspects to the methods presented in the example that will allow for the facile adoption by a broad set of researchers. First, the high editing frequencies do not require the screening of large numbers of clones to identify those with the desired modification. Moreover, we demonstrate that BIG-TREE is robust, as it allows for the efficient editing of multiple loci and across several independent hPSC lines. Because of these efficiencies, clonal lines can be identified, expanded, and characterized in the course of a few weeks. Along similar lines, the high efficiency of BIG-TREE allows for the biallelic or multiplexed targeting without the need for sequential re-targeting. In addition, BIG-TREE is compatible with off-the-shelf chemical transfection reagents and does not require the cloning of complex viral constructs or the use of specialized cell transfection systems. In fact, all sgRNA vectors were designed to allow for the facile cloning of new target sites via BbsI restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of oligonucleotides that target the desired genomic sequence. Lastly, BIG-TREE offers the flexibility to be used in conjunction with other base editor variants that have altered PAM specificities and editing windows. For instance, the PAM sequence and edit distance can be modified to match the editing specificity and window of the new base editor. Such modifications are straightforward to achieve with the BFP vector using TREE, or the stop codon between RFP and GFP using BIG-TREE. In this manner, BIG-TREE is a readily adoptable method that will enhance and accelerate the use of base-editing approaches in hPSCs.",
