# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- relate to extending concept labels

## BACKGROUND

- define ontology

## SUMMARY

- motivate ontology engineering
- limitations of existing ontologies
- need for efficient extension

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- depict flowchart of acts for extending concept labels of an ontology
- introduce two major acts: extracting terms and extending concept labels
- detail act of extracting terms in a target language from a representative corpus
- perform language analysis and statistical analysis
- process corpus using linguistical techniques tailored for domain-specific language
- determine basic processing units: words and sentences
- stem individual words for subsequent annotation task
- create list of first terms using statistical techniques
- evaluate text stems according to occurrence and/or co-occurrence
- rank terms in list by linguistical relevancy
- apply filtering algorithm to exclude terms from translation
- use linguistical, statistical, and additional information for filtering
- detail act of translating terms into source language
- use translation module to translate first terms into second terms
- provide human user feedback to increase quality of second term
- detail act of extending concept labels of an ontology
- use second terms to find correlating ontology concepts
- provide manual user feedback to increase quality of mapping
- extend matching ontology concepts by first term
- detail embodiment using an ontology with partially populated concept labels
- execute ontology-based concept annotation
- combine target-language vocabulary stems from ontology and corpus
- annotate stems with represented ontology concepts
- illustrate extension of concept labels of a medical ontology RadLex
- conclude act of extracting terms from a representative corpus
