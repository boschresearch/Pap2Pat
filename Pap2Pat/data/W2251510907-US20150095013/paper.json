    "title": "Corpus-based Translation of Ontologies for Improved Multilingual Semantic Annotation",
    "date": "2014-01-01",
    "abstract": "Ontologies have proven to be useful to enhance NLP-based applications such as information extraction. In the biomedical domain rich ontologies are available and used for semantic annotation of texts. However, most of them have either no or only few non-English concept labels and cannot be used to annotate non-English texts. Since translations need expert review, a full translation of large ontologies is often not feasible. For semantic annotation purpose, we propose to use the corpus to be annotated to identify high occurrence terms and their translations to extend respective ontology concepts. Using our approach, the translation of a subset of ontology concepts is sufficient to significantly enhance annotation coverage. For evaluation, we automatically translated RadLex ontology concepts from English into German. We show that by translating a rather small set of concepts (in our case 433), which were identified by corpus analysis, we are able to enhance the amount of annotated words from 27.36 % to 42.65 %.",

                "Ontologies offer a powerful way to represent a shared understanding of a conceptualization of a domain (Gruber, 1993a). They define concepts and relations between them. Further linguistic information, such as labels, synonyms, abbreviations or definitions, can be attached. This is how ontologies provide a controlled vocabulary for the respective domain. In Information Extraction (IE), the controlled vocabulary of ontologies is used to recognize ontology concepts in text (also referred to as semantic annotation) and combine the textual information and the ontological knowledge to allow a deeper understanding of the text's semantics.",
                "The problem, however, is that most of the available ontologies are not multilingual, i.e., they have either no or only few non-English concept labels. To make ontologies applicable for IE-based applications dealing with non-English texts, one has to translate at least some of the concept labels. Since high quality translations need expert review, a full translation of big ontologies is often not feasible. In the biomedical domain, ontologies have a long tradition and many well designed, large and semantically rich ontologies exist. At the time of writing, the BioPortal (Noy et al., 2008), an ontology repository for the biomedical domain, contains 370 ontologies, where 49 have more than 10,000 concepts. Their complete translation would be very costly.",
                "In many application scenarios, only a subset of ontology concepts is of relevance. This is especially true for IE: If we consider, e.g., the semantic annotation of medical records in the context of a specific disease, the translation of a subset of ontology concept labels can be sufficient to increase the number of ontology concepts found. Thus, the translation of a small set of labels, which is relevant for the application scenario, is sufficient to increase the ontology's applicability for IE from non-English texts.",
                "That is why we propose a translation approach that identifies the most relevant concepts for the application scenario and adds their translations to the ontology. The application scenario is represented by the corpus, a 'large set of domain-specific text'. In the context of IE, the main goal is to achieve a high annotation coverage, i.e., a high amount of words are semantically annotated with the correlating ontology concepts. Therefore, we define the terms with high frequency in the corpus as most relevant for translation, as the translation of high frequency terms increases the annotation coverage significantly. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use the RadLex ontology (Langlotz, 2006) and a corpus of German radiology reports of lymphoma patients."

                "Ontology-based IE is a commonly used technique in the biomedical domain. (Meystre et al., 2008) give a detailed overview of recent research activities. However, most projects focus on English texts. The ontology translation problem was first described by (Gruber, 1993b) and further formalized by (Espinoza et al., 2009b). The subproblem we are dealing with is ontology localization, which (Su\u00e1rez-figueroa and G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez, 2008) refers to as 'the adaptation of an ontology to a particular language and culture'. The challenges of ontology localization are analyzed in (Espinoza et al., 2009b) and a general methodology for guiding the localization process is presented. By (Cimiano et al., 2010), ontology localization can affect two different layers: the lexical layer (labels, definitions and accompanying documentation in natural language) and the conceptualization itself. Thus, the translation of concept labels we conduct can be seen as a subtask of ontology localization targeting only the lexical layer. The focus of our work does not lie in the machine translation task itself but in the intelligent use of existing resources for multilingual extension of ontologies with the aim to enhance the annotation coverage for a certain corpus. (Espinoza et al., 2009a) focus on sense disambiguation as major problem in ontology localization, while we investigate how to increase the efficiency by incorporating a corpus."

Using this resource allows us to customize our approach for the required application scenario. Its content is used to digest the most relevant concepts for translation and determine the correct translation option. The processing incorporates linguistic and statistical NLP techniques to extract terms in target language with high frequency from the corpus.",
                "2 Concept Filtering As the list of extracted terms still includes terms without semantic importance, we introduce this step in order to reduce the list.

                "3 Mapping Corpus Terms to Ontology Concepts Our approach is targeted to translate only existing ontology concepts. Thus, we need a mechanism to map the terms of the corpus to the ontology concepts. We do this by employing state-of-the-art dictionary lookups: The English dictionary equivalences of the German corpus terms are used to find ontology concepts with the same English labels. Then, the (corpus) term is added as translation to the matching ontology concept as non-English label. The resulting translated ontology can be used in subsequent NLP-based applications and is able to serve the need for non-English texts.",

Further, we use the corpus as semantic annotation target, which is annotated with ontology terms. The language-specific translations used for semantic annotation were found before with the help of the corpus itself. For the study, we use a corpus of 2,713 radiology reports (from 27 different readers1 ) of lymphoma patients containing the findings and evaluation sections."

Each of the processing steps is implemented as a single UIMA annotator and integrated into an overall pipeline. First, semantic information units such as dates and measurements are recognized using regular expressions. Medical language is rich in abbreviations. Particularly radiologists make use of them, because they allow an efficient reporting. Therefore, as second step, we build an abbreviation recognition and extension algorithm on a simple dictionary. The third linguistic task is the determination of the basic processing units: (1) tokens and (2) sentences. Tokens are split employing the spaces and '-' in the text, hence no compound splitting is conducted. While token splitting is a rather simple task, sentence splitting requires disambiguation facilities. Indicators like '?','!',';','.' are used to determine sentence ends. However, the full stop determines sentence ends only if they are not part of a measurement, date or abbreviation. As a fourth step, stopwords are removed from the documents to reduce the content to only relevant tokens. Available language-dependent stopword lists are employed. Finally, each of the tokens in the text is stemmed with the German version of the Porter stemmer. (Porter, 1997) "

The annotation dictionary is built from the preferred names and synonyms in the RadLex ontology (as shown in Figure 3). Our concept mapper combines the stems of the dictionary terminology and the stems of the text tokens and annotates the matches with the ontology information. If a dictionary term consists of more than one token, an annotation is created if all of its stems are contained in a single sentence of the corpus. That is also how single tokens can be assigned more than one annotation."

Despite the restrictiveness of the comparison, we see that an annotation coverage of 42.65 % is high considering that only about 25 % of the extended RadLex's concepts have a German label."

We believe that our approach is able to unlock the high potential of existing ontologies also for low re-sourced languages. We address the key problem of identifying those concepts that are worth translating by defining the increase of annotation coverage for a given corpus as the main target. Although it might seem intuitive to apply an English corpus to identify the most frequent terms and their (source) ontology concepts to translate, we do not pursue this approach. Especially when dealing with a domain-specific language, translations are often ambiguous. As the English corpus does not help picking the correct (target) translation candidate, we decided to start the other way around and facilitate a corpus in target language. We show the high quality and efficiency of the approach by translating medical terms from English to German. According to the evaluation results, a better treatment of n-grams shows the biggest potential for enhancement of the approach. Sophisticated linguistic algorithms for the translation, which incorporate the ontology context, can increase the matching of the multi-word terms. In future work, we plan to evaluate our approach using other ontologies from the BioPortal."
