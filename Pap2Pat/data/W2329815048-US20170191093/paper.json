    "date": "2016-03-31",
    "abstract": "Microbial lipids are produced by many oleaginous organisms including the well-characterized yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, which can be engineered for increased lipid yield by up-regulation of the lipid biosynthetic pathway and down-regulation or deletion of competing pathways.We describe a strain engineering strategy centered on diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA) gene overexpression that applied combinatorial screening of overexpression and deletion genetic targets to construct a high lipid producing yeast biocatalyst. The resulting strain, NS432, combines overexpression of a heterologous DGA1 enzyme from Rhodosporidium toruloides, a heterlogous DGA2 enzyme from Claviceps purpurea, and deletion of the native TGL3 lipase regulator. These three genetic modifications, selected for their effect on lipid production, enabled a 77 % lipid content and 0.21 g lipid per g glucose yield in batch fermentation. In fed-batch glucose fermentation NS432 produced 85 g/L lipid at a productivity of 0.73 g/L/h.The yields, productivities, and titers reported in this study may further support the applied goal of cost-effective, large -scale microbial lipid production for use as biofuels and biochemicals.",

                "Microbial lipid production has received applied interest both for the synthesis of specialty chemicals and for the production of fuels and bulk chemicals from low-cost carbon feedstocks [1]. Considering the high demand for lipid molecules, augmentation of current plant- and animal-based production by microbial conversion of starch and sugar crops, agricultural residues, and lignocellulosic material has been the subject of many recent studies. Among natively oleaginous organisms, which are capable of producing lipids at a level greater than 20\u00a0% of their dry cell weight, the well-characterized yeast Yarrowia lipolytica [2] has received particular interest. Wild-type Y. lipolytica can accumulate lipids up to 36\u00a0% of dry cell weight from glucose [3] and 50\u201360\u00a0% of dry cell weight when fed exogenous fatty acid substrates for biomodification to higher value fats and oils [4, 5], and researchers have metabolically engineered strains to produce high value lipids [6\u20138]. In addition to production and bio-modification of lipids, Y. lipolytica strains are capable of secreting low-molecular weight secondary metabolites such as citric acid and polyols, and extracellular enzymes under specific fermentation conditions [9, 10]. Extensive genetic systems have been developed to manipulate this yeast [9, 11, 12].",
                "Lipids serve as energy storage molecules and building blocks for cellular membranes and are composed of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and other water-insoluble hydrocarbon molecules. In many oleaginous yeasts, fatty acids are the dominant lipid compound, constituting 90\u201395\u00a0% of total lipid material [13, 14]. To avoid the potentially toxic and membrane-disturbing effects of free fatty acids, they are incorporated into nonpolar lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAG) and sterol esters. TAGs are stored in subcellular compartments termed lipid droplets or lipid bodies [15\u201318].",
                "Several applied studies have focused on increasing TAG production through genetic engineering of TAG synthesis and degradation pathways [19\u201321], including recent publications that have pushed previous limits of Y. lipolytica lipid productivity and titer [22\u201324]. A series of proteins were postulated as regulators of the conversion of carbohydrate sources into TAGs: malic enzyme (ME), ATP citrate lyase (ACL), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), Bifunctional glycerol-3-phosphate/glycerone-phosphate O-acyltransferase (SCT), 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (SLC1), Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and phospholipid: diacylglycerol Acyltransferase (LRO) (Fig.\u00a01).Fig.\u00a01Major steps of lipid biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica. Overexpression genetic targets screened in this study for their effect on lipid production are shown in\u00a0green boxes. Deletion genetic targets are shown in red\u00a0boxes",
                "In particular, the enzymes DGA1 (diacylglycerol acyltransferase type 2) and DGA2 (diacylglycerol acyltransferase type 1) have been recognized as key components of the lipid pathway, performing the final step of TAG synthesis, incorporation of the third acyl-CoA onto the diacylglycerol backbone and transport into the lipid droplet [23]. Up-regulation of the native Y. lipolytica DGA1 and DGA2 enzymes have significantly increased lipid yield and productivity [19, 21, 26], and it has been hypothesized that efficient diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity creates a critical driving force for high levels of lipid accumulation in oleaginous organisms due to its dual role in TAG biosynthesis and transport into the lipid droplet [19, 27, 28]. Additionally, it has been shown that the deletion of DGA2 impairs TAG synthesis and lipid production in Y. lipolytica [25]. It has also been demonstrated that DGA1 or DGA2 overexpression is beneficial for lipid accumulation in R. toruloides [29] as well as in plant seeds [30].",
                "In this study, we describe a systematic lipid biosynthesis engineering approach centered on diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene overexpression. First, we evaluated combinations of endogenous gene targets and then we optimized key enzymes by screening heterologous genes for engineering of an improved lipid-accumulating biocatalyst. The resulting strain of this process reached a 77\u00a0% lipid content and a 0.21\u00a0g lipid per g glucose yield in batch glucose fermentation, while in fed-batch glucose fermentation it produced 85\u00a0g/L lipid at a 0.73\u00a0g/L/h productivity."

                        "In an effort to develop a biocatalyst for industrial lipid production, we evaluated several Y. lipolytica wild-type strains for desirable biocatalyst qualities, such as minimal citric acid secretion, non-hyphal morphology, and ease of genetic manipulation. We isolated one such strain, designated NS18 (obtained from NRRL # YB-392), for future strain engineering. Previous studies have identified several endogenous genes which improve lipid production when overexpressed or deleted in Y. lipolytica [19, 21, 25, 31]. One of these genes, DGA1, encoding for diacylglycerol acyltransferase type 2, is involved in the final step of TAG synthesis [2, 19, 21, 25, 32\u201336] and has been a key genetic up-regulation target to increase production of TAG from glucose in independent Y. lipolytica studies [19, 21].",
                        "In order to evaluate the effect of DGA1 overexpression in NS18, the Y. lipolyticaDGA1 gene (NG15) was introduced into the NS18 genome under the control of the strong constitutive GPD1 promoter to produce strain NS297. Although use of promoters with varied expression levels may allow for a higher degree of metabolic balancing and control, we felt strongly constitutive promoters were suitable for identifying targets for lipid biosynthesis overexpression. To produce engineered strains, 50\u2013200 transformants were screened in 96- or 48-well plates and evaluated by fluorescence-based assay for lipid content. The top isolates were then tested in 50-mL shake flasks and the highest performing strains were grown in 1\u00a0L bioreactors using a high cell density fed-batch glucose fermentation process followed by gas chromotograph (GC) lipid content analysis. Lipid content measured by GC is reported as fatty acid methyl ester equivalents, as described in the methods section. NS297 transformants exhibited a twofold increase in lipid content compared to wild-type Y. lipolytica NS18 as evaluated by fluorescence assay (Figs.\u00a02, 4a, b) and GC analysis (Fig.\u00a04b).Fig.\u00a02Overexpression of DGA1 genes in Y. lipolytica strain NS18.

The average with standard deviation from triplicate experiments is shown for the parent strain. Fluorescence was measured at excitation 486\u00a0nm and emission 510\u00a0nm and normalized by cell optical density (OD) at 600\u00a0nm"

                        "Given the effectiveness of endogenous DGA1 overexpression in Y. lipolytica, we next sought to express DGA1 from oleaginous organisms that natively attain lipid at 50\u00a0% or more of their dry weight and have publically accessible genome sequences [3, 37\u201340]. We chose DGA1 genes from five such organisms: Rhodosporidium toruloides, Lipomyces starkeyi, Aurantiochytrium limacinum, Aspergillus terreus, and Claviceps purpurea. Three versions of the R. toruloidesDGA1 gene were expressed in Y. lipolytica: NG49\u2014the native R. toruloidesDGA1 gene amplified from R. toruloides genomic DNA; NG66\u2014a synthetic gene containing R. toruloides DGA1 cDNA without introns; and NG67\u2014a synthetic gene containing R. toruloides DGA1 cDNA without introns and codon optimized for expression in Y. lipolytica. Two versions of L. starkeyi DGA1 were expressed in Y. lipolytica: NG68\u2014a synthetic gene containing L. starkeyi DGA1 cDNA without introns; and NG69\u2014a synthetic gene containing L. starkeyi DGA1 cDNA without introns and codon optimized for expression in Y. lipolytica. A. limacinum (NG70), A. terreus (NG71), and C. purpurea (NG72) DGA1 genes were synthesized without introns and codon optimized for expression in Y. lipolytica. A total of nine different DGA1 genes were expressed in Y. lipolytica under the same strong Y. lipolytica GPD1 promoter (Table\u00a02). Expression of all nine DGA1 genes had a positive effect on lipid content in Y. lipolytica (Fig.\u00a02). Due to the random, non-targeted nature of integration, which can result in a range of DGA1 expression, the diversity we saw in transformants\u2019 lipid accumulation was not unexpected. Additionally, there is the potential for multiple DGA1 expression vector copies to simultaneously integrate during genetic transformation. To investigate the likelihood of our results being influenced by DNA copy number, we performed an experiment where two independent, non-linked selectable markers were co-transformed and the frequency of selectable marker co-expression was measured (Additional file 1: Figure S1). This test indicated that for the DNA loadings used in this study (approximately 1\u00a0\u03bcg vector DNA/transformation) the frequency of two copies simultaneously integrating is 6\u00a0% of total transformants.",
                        "Transformants that demonstrated the highest fluorescence output per optical density were generated by overexpression of R. toruloides DGA1 (NG66, NG67) and L. starkeyi DGA1 (NG68). These achieved lipid levels approximately three-fold higher than NS18 and were also higher than transformants overexpressing the native Y. lipolyticaDGA1 gene. The most effective DGA1 genes came from donors that were repeatedly reported to attain the highest lipid contents among other oleaginous yeast strains [3, 41]. These results suggest that DGA1-specific activity and/or expression level could be a major factor driving lipid production levels in oleaginous yeasts. The effect of native R. toruloides DGA1 (NG49) overexpression on lipid production in Y. lipolytica was not as high as the effect of the synthetic versions of R. toruloidesDGA1 genes that did not contain introns. This result may indicate that the heterologous R. toruloidesDGA1 gene was not spliced efficiently in Y. lipolytica. Codon optimization of R. toruloides and L. starkeyiDGA1 genes did not have a positive effect on lipid production over the native cDNA sequences.",
                        "The top lipid-producing isolate expressing the R. toruloidesDGA1 gene was designated NS281. Strains expressing DGA1 from A. limacinum, A. terreus, and C. purpurea did not show substantial improvements in lipid content compared to strains overexpressing the native Y. lipolyticaDGA1 gene (Fig.\u00a02)."

                        "A secondary screen was designed to test the combination of DGA1 overexpression with other targets in the lipid accumulation pathway (Fig.\u00a01). Secondary deletion or overexpression targets, under the control of the Y. lipolytica EXP1 promoter, were integrated into strain NS125, which overexpresses the Y. lipolyticaDGA1 gene under the control of the Y. lipolytica TEF1 promoter. Targeted gene deletions were enabled by treatment of cells with hydroxyurea to arrest cell cycle division in the S phase during preparation of competent cells [42]. Table\u00a01 summarizes the relative effect of secondary deletion and overexpression targets on lipid content compared to the parental strain NS125. Four overexpression targets, GPD1, SLC1, DGA2, and LRO1, had a positive effect on lipid content when combined with DGA1. Interestingly, all four of these enzymes are involved in the last steps glycerol backbone synthesis and fatty acid attachment for triacylglycerol synthesis. Overexpression of the Y. lipolyticaDGA2 gene increased lipid content by nearly 65\u00a0% compared to the parental strain NS125, which was the highest increase among the targets tested. Due to a limited number of dominant genetic markers, DGA2 alone was selected for further investigation. DGA2 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is hypothesized to be responsible for TAG formation in newly formed lipid bodies, while DGA1 is located on the lipid body membrane and its hypothesized function is to accumulate TAG within the same lipid body and increase its volume [43]. Considering that overexpression of homologous DGA2 alone in Y. lipolytica did not have as pronounced of an effect on lipid content (data not shown), the above data suggest that native DGA2 function is not limiting for TAG formation in\u00a0NS18 wild-type Y. lipolytica but may become a limiting factor once DGA1 activity is abundant.Table\u00a01Relative lipid contents of strains with overexpressed or deleted genetic targets in addition to DGA1 overexpressionGenetic backgroundFunction(Fl/OD)mutant/(Fl/OD)NS125 WTWild-type Yarrowia lipolytica strain0.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02DGA1 (NS125)Diacylglycerol acyltransferase; catalyzes the terminal step of triacylglycerol (TAG) formation, acylates diacylglycerol using acyl-CoA as an acyl donor1.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09DGA1\u0394gut2Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase0.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12DGA1GPD1NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase1.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03DGA1MEMitochondrial malic enzyme; catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15DGA1ACL1/2ATP citrate lyase 1 & 20.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09DGA1ACC1Acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit 11.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19DGA1SCT1Bifunctional glycerol-3-phosphate/glycerone-phosphate O-acyltransferase1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01DGA1SLC11-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07DGA1SCD1Stearoyl-CoA desaturase.

It has been suggested that TGL3 positively regulates TGL4, the primary lipase, but may not have lipase activity on its own, as it lacks a key amino acid motif that is specific for lipase activity [31]. TGL3 or TGL4 deletions in the NS125 background did not increase lipid content after 96\u00a0h of fermentation in smaller scale experiments (Table\u00a01). However, as these genes are directly or indirectly involved in the breakdown of TAG, we hypothesized that their activity would be critical at the end of the bioprocess, when carbon is exhausted and cells attempt to recover stored carbon from lipids. We compared lipid levels at late time-points in the strain overexpressing R. toruloides NG66 DGA1 alone (NS281) and the strain combining NG66 overexpression and TGL3 deletion (NS377).

                        "The stoichiometric pathway yield for TAG lipid production in Y. lipolytica based on known biochemistry for this organism has been calculated at 0.276\u00a0g per gram glucose [44]. However, this value does not include the expenditure of glucose to produce and maintain non-storage lipid yeast biomass, an important consideration for applied microbial lipid production since the amount of non-lipid biomass (i.e., catalyst) and its cell specific lipid productivity determines the rate of lipid production. As shown in Table\u00a04, this study adds to recent literature indicating that Y. lipolytica can be engineered for highly effective lipid production. The batch lipid yield, fed-batch titer, and productivity reported here are among the highest reported [22, 23, 44] and approaches the maximal values predicted by Y. lipolytica lipid biochemistry and co-production of non-storage lipid biomass.Table\u00a04Recently reported literature values for lipid titer, yield, and productivity with engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strainsParental strainStrainLipid pathway genetic engineeringProcessSugar consumed (g/L)Lipid titer (g/L)Overall yield (g/g)Overall volumetric productivity (g/L/h)Cell specific productivity (g/g/h)Referencepo1gMTYL037control strain (ura\u00a0+\u00a0lacZ)Batch802.50.030.020.002[19]po1gMTYL065DGA1 ACC1Batch8017.60.200.140.017[19]po1gYL-ad9DGA1 ACC1 SGD1Fed-batch235550.230.710.038[22]po1fpo1f leu\u00a0+\u00a0ura\u00a0+control strainBatch8030.040.020.001[21]po1fpex10 mfe1 leu\u00a0+\u00a0ura\u00a0+\u00a0DGA1DGA1 \u0394pex10 \u0394mfe1Batch8016.10.200.110.017[21]po1fpex10 mfe1 leu\u00a0+\u00a0ura\u00a0+\u00a0DGA1DGA1 \u0394pex10 \u0394mfe1Batch16025.30.160.21\u2013[21]po1fL36 DGA1 leu\u00a0+\u00a0ura\u00a0+DGA1 mga2-G643RFed-batch160250.210.130.018[24]po1fE26E1DGA1 \u0394pex10 \u0394mfe1 uga-P209SBatch16039.10.240.560.035[23]po1dJMY2593control strain (SUC2)Batch602.60.040.040.004[26]po1dJMY3582DGA2(x3) \u0394dga1 \u0394dga2 \u0394lro1 \u0394are1Batch606.50.110.090.010[26]NS18NS18wild-typeBatch603.60.060.040.002this studyNS18NS432DGA1 DGA2 \u0394tgl3Batch14030.80.210.270.048this studyNS18NS432DGA1 DGA2 \u0394tgl3Fed-batch43084.50.200.730.044this studyWhere necessary, values for overall and cell specific productivities were estimated from figures of cited references [24, 26]"

                "In this study, we describe a strain engineering strategy that applied screening of endogenous and heterologous targets and target combinations for the construction of a high lipid-producing yeast biocatalyst. First, we confirmed that the overexpression of DGA1 increased lipid content in Y. lipolytica. A secondary screen identified genes that boosted lipid accumulation when overexpressed or deleted in combination with DGA1 overexpression. We then searched for heterologous DGA1 and DGA2 genes that would outperform the native enzymes in lipid accumulation and identified R. toruloides DGA1 and C. purpurea DGA2. Finally, we found that deletion of TGL3 reduces TAG degradation during the late phase of the bioprocess when nutrients are limited and lipase-mediated TAG mobilization is triggered. The yields, productivities, and titers reported in this study may further support the applied goal of developing Y. lipolytica for cost effective microbial lipid production. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated the ability to expand Y. lipolytica\u2019s substrate range to low-cost feedstocks such as sucrose [45], xylose [46], cellobiose and lignocellulosic biomass [47], and starch [48]. Researchers have also investigated continuous culture [49, 50] as a lower cost processing method than batch or fed-batch fermentation. The combined actions of attaining high lipid titer with low-cost feedstock utilization and advanced processing strategies should help enable use of this yeast for production of biofuels and biochemicals."
