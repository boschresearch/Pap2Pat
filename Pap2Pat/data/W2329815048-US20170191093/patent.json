                        "Lipids are indispensable ingredients in the food and cosmetics industries, and they are important precursors in the biodiesel and biochemical industries. Many oleaginous microorganisms produce lipids, including the well-characterized yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.",
                        "The lipid yield of oleaginous organisms can be increased by the up-regulation, down-regulation, or deletion of genes implicated in a lipid pathway. Recent data suggests that the activity of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase protein DGA1 may be a significant factor for accumulating high levels of lipids in oleaginous organisms. For example, it was reported that the up-regulation of the native Y. lipolytica diacylglycerol acyltransferase protein DGA1 in Y. lipolytica significantly increases its lipid yield and productivity (ME15:1-9 (2013)).",
                        "The Y. lipolytica DGA1 protein is a type 2 diacylglyecrol acyltransferase encoded by the Y. lipolytica diacylgylcerol acyltransferase gene DGAT2. DGA1 is one of the key enzymes in the lipid pathway, involved in the final step of triacylglycerol (\u201cTAG\u201d) synthesis. Triacylglycerols are the major form of storage lipids in Y. lipolytica. Yeast also contain a type 1 diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene DGAT1, which encodes the DGA2 protein.",
                        "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes can be introduced into a host genome to affect lipid production and composition, including the DGA1 and DGA2 genes from other organisms. For example, other oleaginous yeasts, such as Rhodosporidium toruloides and Lipomyces starkeyi, are able to accumulate significantly more lipids than wild type Y. lipolytica strains, and the expression of DGA1 proteins from organisms with higher native lipid production levels has a greater effect on Y. lipolytica lipid production than the overexpression of native Y. lipolytica DGA1 (U.S. Ser. No. 61/943,664 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US15/017227; hereby incorporated by reference).",
                        "Additionally, genes involved in the breakdown of lipids or in pathways that draw flux away from lipid biosynthesis have been deleted to increase a cell's lipid content. For example, Dulermo et al. demonstrated (feat the deletion of the triacylglycerol lipase gene TGL3 nearly doubled the total lipid content accumulated by Y. lipolytica (BB1831:1486-95 (2013)).",
                        "The successful upregulation of functional enzymes, however, is unpredictable at best. For example, other experiments have shown that expressing DGA1 from Mortierella alpine has no significant effect on Y. lipolytica lipid content (U.S. Pat. No. 7,198,937; hereby incorporated by reference). Similarly, expressing DGA2 has been shown to have no significant effect on the lipid content of yeast in the absence of other genetic modifications."

Expressing the type 2 diacylgylcerol acyltransferase DGA1 increases the amount of protein that can synthesize triacylglycerol, and expressing the DGA1 protein from Rhodosporidium toruloides in a Yarrowia lipolytica cell is effective at increasing the triacylglycerol content of the cell (U.S. Ser. No. 61/943,664 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US15/017227; hereby incorporated by reference). The type 1 diacylgylcerol acyltransferase DGA2 can also catalyze the synthesis of triacylglycerol, and the expression of carefully selected DGA1 and DGA2 transgenes may further increase the lipid content of an oleaginous cell relative to DGA1 alone. Specifically, Yarrowia lipolytica that expresses DGA1 from Rhodasporidmm toruloides and DGA2 from Claviceps purpurea produces high triacylglycerol yields. Finally, triacylglycerol lipases catalyze the degradation of triacylglycerols, and thus, the down-regulation of triacylglycerol lipases can increase the triacylglycerol content of a cell. Specifically, Yarrowia lipolytica cells that contain a TGL3 knockout and express DGA1 from Rhodosporidium toruloides produce higher triacylglycerol yields than DGA1-expressing controls (U.S. Ser. No. 61/987,098 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US15/28760; hereby incorporated by reference). The combination of DGA1 and DGA2 expression with TGL3 down-regulation may further increase triacylglycerol yields.",

For example, the overexpression of native DGA2 alone in Y. lipolytica does not increase the cell's lipid production efficiency, whereas DGA1 increases lipid production. DGA2 localizes to the ER and synthesizes triacylglycerol in newly formed lipid bodies. In contrast, DGA1 localizes to lipid body membranes and synthesizes triacylglycerols within these lipid bodies. Whether this distinction or some other difference affects the cell's ability to suppress the effects of a genetic modification is not well understood. Thus, the combination of DGA1 and DGA2 expression with a TGL3 knockout would not be expected to produce cells with a higher lipid content than those cells containing one or two of the genetic modifications.",

                                "The term \u201cactivity\u201d refers to the total capacity of a cell to perform a function. For example, a genetic modification that decreases the activity of a triacylglycerol lipase in a cell may reduce the amount of triacylglycerol lipase in a cell or reduce the efficiency of triacylglycerol lipase. A triacylglycerol lipase knockout reduces the amount of triacylglycerol lipase in the cell. Alternatively, a mutation to a triacylglycerol lipase gene may reduce the efficiency of its triacylglycerol lipase protein product with little effect on the amount of cellular triacylglycerol lipase. Mutations that reduce the efficiency of triacylglycerol lipase may affect the active site, for example, by changing one or more active site residues; they may impair the enzyme's kinetics, for example, by sterically blocking substrates or products; they may affect protein folding or dynamics, for example, by reducing the proportion of properly-folded enzymes; they may affect protein localization, for example, by preventing the lipase from localizing to lipid particles; or they may affect protein degradation, for example, by adding one or more protein cleavage sites or by adding one or more residues or amino acid sequences that target the protein for proteolysis. These mutations affect coding regions. Mutations that decrease triacylglycerol lipase activity may instead affect the transcription or translation of the gene. For example, imitation to a triacylglycerol lipase enhancer or promoter can reduce triacylglycerol lipase activity by .reducing its expression. Mutating or deleting the non-coding portions of a triacylglycerol lipase gene, such as its introns, may also reduce transcription or translation. Additionally, mutations to the upstream regulators of a triacylglycerol lipase may affect triacylglycerol lipase activity; for example, the over-expression of one or more repressors may decrease triacylglycerol lipase activity, and a knockout or mutation of one or more activators may similarly decrease triacylglycerol lipase activity.",

For example, the genetic modification may simply insert an additional copy of diacylglycerol acyltransferase into the cell such that the additional copy is transcribed and translated into additional functional diacylglycerol acyltransferase. The added diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene can be native to the host organism or from a different organism. Alternatively, mutating or deleting the non-coding portions of a native diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene, such as its introns, may also increase translation. A native diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene can be altered by adding a new promoter that causes more transcription. Similarly, enhancers may be added to the diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene that increase transcription, or silencers may be mutated, or deleted from the diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene to increase transcription. Mutations to a native gene's coding region might also increase diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity, for example, by producing a protein variant that does not interact with inhibitory proteins or molecules. The over-expression of one or more activators may increase diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity by increasing the expression of a diacylglycerol acyltransferase protein, and a knockout or mutation of one or more repressors may similarly increase diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity.",

Suitable host cells for expression of the genes and nucleic acid molecules are microbial hosts that can be found broadly within the fungal or bacterial families. Examples of suitable host strains include but are not limited to fungal or yeast species, such as Arxula, Aspergillus, Aurantiochytrium, Candida, Claviceps, Cryptococcus, Cumnnghamella, Geotrichum, Hansemda, Kluyveromyces, Kodamaea, Leucosporidiella, Lipomyces, Mortierella, Ogataea, Pichia, Prototheca, Rhizopus, Rhodosporidium, Rhodotorula, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Tremella, Trichosporon, Wickerhamomyces, Yarrowia, or bacterial species, such as members of proteobacteria and actinomyeetes, as well as the genera Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Brevibacterium, Acidovorax, Bacillus, Clostridia, Streptomyces, Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Cornyebacterium. Yarrowia lipolytica and Arxula adeninivorans are well-suited for use as the host microorganism because they can accumulate a large percentage of their weight as triacylglycerols.",

Any of these could be used to construct chimeric genes to produce any one of the gene products of the instant sequences. These chimeric genes could then be introduced into appropriate microorganisms via transformation techniques to provide high-level expression of the enzymes.",
                                "For example, a gene encoding an enzyme can be cloned in a suitable plasmid, and an aforementioned starting parent strain as a host can be transformed with the resulting plasmid. Th s approach, can increase the copy number of each of the genes encoding the enzymes and, as a result, the activities of the enzymes can be increased. The plasmid is not particularly limited so long as it renders a desired genetic modification inheritable to the microorganism's progeny.",

Suitable vectors comprise a region 5\u2032 of the gene harboring transcriptional initiation controls and a region 3\u2032 of the DNA fragment which controls transcriptional termination. Both control regions may be derived from genes homologous to the transformed host cell, although it is to be understood that such control regions need not be derived from the genes native to the specific species chosen as a production host.",

                                "Homologous recombination is the ability of complementary DNA sequences to align and exchange regions of homology. Transgenic DNA (\u201cdonor\u201d) containing sequences homologous to the genomic sequences being targeted (\u201ctemplate\u201d) is introduced into the organism and then undergoes recombina tion into the genome at the site of the corresponding homologous genomic sequences.",
                                "The ability to carry out homologous recombination in a host organism has many practical implications for what can be carried out at the molecular genetic level and is useful in the generation of a microbe that can produce a desired product. By its very nature homologous recombination is a precise gene targeting event, and hence, most transgenic lines generated with the same targeting sequence will be essentially identical in terms of phenotype, necessitating the screening of far fewer transformation events. Homologous recombination also targets gene insertion events into the host chromosome, potentially resulting in excellent genetic stability, even in the absence of genetic selection. Because different chromosomal loci will likely impact gene expression, even from exogenous promoters/UTRs, homologous recombination can be a method of querying loci in an unfamiliar genome environment and to assess the impact of these environments on gene expression.",
                                "A particularly useful genetic engineering approach using homologous recombination is to co-opt specific host regulatory elements such as promoters/UTRs to drive heterologous gene expression in a highly specific fashion.",
                                "Because homologous recombination is a precise gene targeting event, it can be used to precisely modify any nucleotide(s) within a gene or region of interest, so long as sufficient flanking regions have been identified. Therefore, homologous recombination can be used as a means to modify regulatory sequences impacting gene expression of RNA and/or proteins. It can also be used to modify protein coding regions in an effort to modify enzyme activities such as substrate specificity, affinities and Km, thereby affecting a desired change in the metabolism of the host cell. Homologous recombination provides a powerful means to manipulate the host genome resulting in gene targeting, gene conversion, gene deletion, gene duplication, gene inversion, and exchanging gene expression regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and 3\u2032UTRs.",
                                "Homologous recombination can be achieved by using targeting constructs containing pieces of endogenous sequences to \u201ctarget\u201d the gene or region of interest within the endogenous host cell genome. Such targeting sequences can either be located 5\u2032 of the gene or region of interest, 3\u2032 of the gene/region of interest or even flank, the gene/region of interest. Such targeting constructs can be transformed into the host cell either as a superceded plasmid DNA with additional vector backbone, a PGR product with no vector backbone, or as a linearized molecule. In some cases, it may be advantageous to first expose the homologous sequences within the transgenic DNA (donor DNA) by cutting the transgenic DNA with a restriction enzyme. This step can increase the recombination efficiency and decrease the occurrence of undesired events. Other methods of increasing recombination efficiency include using PCR to generate transforming transgenic DNA containing linear ends homologous to the genomic sequences being targeted.",
                                "C. Vectors and Vector Components",
                                "Vectors for transforming microorganisms in accordance with the present invention can be prepared by known techniques familiar to those skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein. A vector typically contains one or more genes, in which each gene codes for the expression of a desired product (the gene product) and is operably linked to one or more control sequences that regulate gene expression or target the gene product to a particular location in the recombinant cell.",
                                "1. Control Sequences",
                                "Control sequences are nucleic acids that regulate the expression of a coding sequence or direct a gene product to a particular location inside or outside a cell. Control sequences that regulate expression include, for example, promoters that regulate transcription of a coding sequence and terminators that terminate transcription of a coding sequence. Another control sequence is a 3\u2032 untranslated sequence located at the end of a coding sequence that encodes a polyadenylation signal. Control sequences that direct gene products to particular locations include those that encode signal peptides, which direct the protein to which they are attached to a particular location inside or outside the cell.",
                                "Thus, an exemplary vector design for expression of a gene in a microbe contains a coding sequence for a desired gene product (for example, a selectable marker, or an enzyme) in operable linkage with a promoter active in yeast. Alternatively, if the vector does not contain a promoter in operable linkage with the coding sequence of interest, the coding sequence can be transformed into the cells such that it becomes operably linked to an endogenous promoter at the point of vector integration.",
                                "The promoter used to express a gene can be the promoter naturally linked to that gene or a different promoter.",
                                "A promoter can generally be characterized as constitutive or inducible. Constitutive promoters are generally active or function to drive expression at all times (or at certain times in the cell life cycle) at the same level inducible promoters, conversely, are active (or rendered inactive) or are significantly up- or down-regulated only in response to a stimulus. Both types of promoters find application in the methods of the invention. Inducible promoters useful in the invention include those that mediate transcription of an operably linked gene in response to a stimulus, such as an exogenously provided small molecule, temperature (heat or cold), lack of nitrogen in culture media, etc. Suitable promoters can activate transcription of an essentially silent gene or upregulate, preferably substantially, transcription of an operably linked gene that is transcribed at a low level.",
                                "Inclusion of termination region control sequence is optional, and if employed, then the choice is primarily one of convenience, as the termination region is relatively interchangeable. The termination region may be native to the transcriptional initiation region (the promoter), may be native to the DNA sequence of interest, or may be obtainable from another source (See, e.g., Chen & Orozco, Nucleic Acids Research 16:8411 (1988)).",

                                "Typically, a gene includes a promoter, coding sequence, and termination control sequences. When assembled by recombinant DNA technology, a gene may be termed an expression cassette and may be flanked by restriction sites for convenient insertion into a vector that is used to introduce the recombinant gene into a host cell. The expression cassette can be flanked by DNA sequences from the genome or other nucleic acid target to facilitate stable integration of the expression cassette into the genome by homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector and its expression cassette may reman unintegrated (e.g., an episome), in which case, the vector typically includes an origin of replication, which is capable of providing for replication of the vector DNA.",
                                "A common gene present on a vector is a gene that codes for a protein, the expression of which allows the recombinant cell containing the protein to be differentiated from cells that do not express the protein. Such a gene, and its corresponding gene product, is called a selectable marker or selection marker. Any of a wide variety of selec table markers can be employed in a transgene construct useful for transforming the organisms of the invention.",
                                "For optimal expression of a recombinant protein, it is beneficial to employ coding sequences that produce mRNA with codons optimally used by the host cell to be transformed. Thus, proper expression of transgencs can require that the codon usage of the transgene matches the specific codon bias of the organism in which the transgene is being expressed. The precise mechanisms underlying this effect are many, but include the proper balancing of available aminoacylated tRNA pools with proteins being synthesized in the cell, coupled with more efficient translation of the transgenic messenger RNA (mRNA) when this need is met. When codon usage in the transgene is not optimized, available tRNA pools are not sufficient to allow for efficient translation of the transgenic mRNA resulting in ribosomal stalling and termination and possible instability of the transgenic mRNA.",
                                "C. Transformation",
                                "Cells can be transformed bv any suitable technique including, e.g., biolistics, eleetroporatkm, glass bead transformation, and silicon carbide whisker transformation. Any convenient technique for introducing a transgenic into a microorganism can be employed in the present invention. Transformation can be achieved by, for example, the method of D. M. Morrison (Methods in Enzymology 68:326 (1979)), the method by increasing permeability of recipient cells for DNA with calcium chloride (Mandel & Higa, J. Molecular Biology, 53:159 (1970)), or the like.",
                                "Examples of expression of transgenes in oleaginous yeast (e.g., Yarrowia lipolytica) can be found in the literature (Bordes et al., J. Microbiological Methods, 70:493 (2007); Chen et al., Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology 48:232 (1997)). Examples of expression of exogenous genes in bacteria such as E. coli are well known (Green & Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, (4th ed., 2012)).",

In one embodiment, an exemplary vector design for expression of a gene in a microorganism contains a gene encoding an enzyme in operable linkage with a promoter active in the microorganism. Alternatively, if the vector does not contain a promoter in operable linkage with the gene of interest, the gene can be transformed into the cells such that it becomes operably linked to a native promoter at the point of vector integration. The vector can also contain a second gene that encodes a protein. Optionally , one or both gcne(s) is/are followed by a 3\u2032 untranslated sequence containing a polyadenyiation signal. Expression cassettes encoding the two genes can be physically linked in the vector or on separate vectors. Co-transformation of microbes can also be used, in which distinct vector molecules are simultaneously used to transform cells (Protist 155:381-93 (2004)). The transformed cells can be optionally selected based upon the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic or other selectable marker under conditions in which cells lacking the resistance cassette would not grow."

Thus, decreasing the net triacylglycerol lipase activity of a cell may increase the cell's triacylglycerol. This decrease may be accomplished by reducing the efficiency of the enzyme, e.g., by mutating amino acids in its active site, or by reducing the expression of the enzyme. For example, a TGL3 knockout mutation will decrease the activity of a triacylglycerol lipase because it prevents the cell from transcribing TGL3. Triacylglycerol lipase knockouts are described in U.S. Ser. No. 61/987,098 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US15/28760 (hereby incorporated by reference).",

Such genetic modifications may affect a protein that regulates the transcription of a triacylglycerol lipase gene, including modifications that decrease the expression of a transcription activator and/or increase the expression of a transcription repressor. Modifications that affect a regulator protein may both decrease the expression of triacylglycerol lipase and alter other gene expression profiles that shift the cellular equilibrium toward increased lipid accumulation or modified lipid composition.

In other embodiments, the genetic modification consists of the homologous recombination of a nucleic acid and the regulatory region of a native triacylglycerol lipase gene, including an operator, promoter, sequences upstream from: the promoter, enhancers, and sequences downstream of the gene.",

Thus, the genetic modification deletes the tnacylglycerol lipase gene, prevents its transcription, or prevents the transcription of a gene that can be transcribed into a fully-active protein. A homologous recombination event may mutate or delete a portion, of a native triacylglycerol lipase gene. For example, the homologous recombination event may mutate one or more residues in the active site of a native triacylglycerol lipase, thereby reducing the efficiency of the lipase or rendering it inactive. Alternatively, the homologous recombination event may affect post-translational modification, folding, stability, or localization within the cell. In some embodiments, the homologous recombination event replaces the promoter with a promoter that drives less transcription. In other embodiments, the homologous recombination event mutates the promoter to impair its ability to drive transcription. In certain embodiments, the genetic modification is a triacylglycerol lipase knockout mutation. Knockout mutations are preferable because they eliminate a pathway that depletes a cell's triacylglycerol content, thereby increasing the triacylglycerol content of a cell.",

Additionally, the knockout mutation may substitute a triacylglycerol lipase gene with a gene that encodes a different protein. The gene may be operably linked to an exogenous promoter. In certain embodiments, the gene is not linked to an exogenous promoter, and instead, the gene is configured to recombine with the triacylglycerol lipase gene such that the triacylglycerol lipase gene's promoter drives transcription of the gene. Thus, the gene is less likely to be expressed if it randomly integra tes into the cell's genome. Methods for creating knockouts are well-known in the art (See, e.g., Fickers et al., J.

NS281 expresses the DGA1 gene from Rhodosporidium torulouides as described above. The Y. lipolytica TGL3 gene (YALI0D17534g, SEQ ID NO:42) was deleted as follows: A two-fragment deletion cassette was amplified by PCR from a plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene (\u201chph,\u201d SEQ ID NO:44) using primer pairs NP1798-NP656 and NP655-NP1799 (SEQ ID NOS: 45-48).

No. 61/819,746 and PCT Patent Application Publication No. WO 14/182657 (both hereby incorporated by reference). The omission of a promoter and terminator in the hph cassette and the splitting of the hph coding sequence into two PCR fragments reduce the probability that random integration of these pieces will confer hygromycin resistance. The hph gene should only be expressed if it integrates at the TGL3 locus by homologous recombination so that the TGL3 promoter and terminator can direct its transcription. Hygromycin resistant colonies were screened by PCR to confirm the absence of TGL3 and the presence of a tgl3::hyg specific product. Deletion of TGL3 in NS18 resulted in strain NS421.

                                "The map of the expression construct used to express the DGAs in Y. lipolytica is shown in FIG. 7, with the NG288 target as example. The constructs for all other DGAs (except for NG112) were the same, except for the target open reading frames. The expression construct used to express NG112 in NS589 is shown in FIG. 3. The expression constructs were assembled by yeast mediated ligation as described below, except for the NG112 gene, which is described in Example 3, supra.",
                                "The constructs were linearized by PmeI/AscI restriction digest before transformation. Each linear expression construct included an expression cassette for a DGA gene and for the S. cerevisiae SUC2 gene encoding invertase, used as marker for selection with sucrose. The expression constructs were randomly integrated into the genome of NS598 using foe transformation protocol described by Chen el al. (Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology 45:232-35 (1997)). The Y. lipolytica transformants were selected on YNB plates with 2% sucrose. The transformants were screened for an ability to accumulate lipids by the fluorescent staining lipid assay described in Example 2. Results for the lipid assays are shown in the FIG. 8. For each expression construct, eight transformants were analyzed. The parental strain NS598 was used as negative control. The assays were carried out in 3 plates. The data in FIG. 8 demonstrates that each DGA1 and DGA3 tested displayed a significant positive effect on the lipid content of Y. lipolytica. Some DGA2s also displayed a positive effect on the lipid content of Y. lipolytica, with Claviceps purpurea DGA2 (NG112) showing the largest increase. These results vary from the DGA screen described for A. adminivorans in Example 6, supra, which suggests that the effect of different DGAs on lipid content is host organism specific."
