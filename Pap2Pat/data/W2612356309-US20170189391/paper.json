    "title": "Protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine selectively inhibits proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells",
    "date": "2017-05-17",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer lacking targeted therapy currently. Recent studies imply that protein kinase C may play important roles in TNBC development and could be a specific target. In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of PKC inhibitor chelerythrine on a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Chelerythrine selectively inhibited the growth of TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines as demonstrated by in vitro cell proliferation assay and colony formation assay, as well as evidenced by in vivo xenograft assay. The selective anti-proliferative effect of chelerythrine was associated with induction of apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. We further demonstrated that PKN2, one of the PKC subtypes, was highly expressed in TNBC cell lines, and knocking down PKN2 in TNBC cells inhibited colony formation and xenograft growth. This indicates that PKN2 is required for the survival of TNBC cells, and could be the target mediates the selective activity of chelerythrine. Finally, combination of chelerythrine and chemotherapy reagent taxol showed synergistic/additive effect on TNBC cell lines. Our results suggest chelerythrine or other PKC inhibitors may be promising regimens for TNBC tumors.",

                "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.67 million new cases diagnosed and more than half million deaths in 20121. Clinically, based on the expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), breast cancer is classified into subgroups of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative breast cancer2. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by absence of ER/PR and lack of overexpression of HER2, represents approximately 10\u201315% of all breast cancers3.",
                "As TNBC does not respond to either hormonal therapy or anti-HER2 agents, stand chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic medical treatment with this subtype of breast cancer4. TNBC initially responds to conventional chemotherapy, however patients frequently show repaid disease relapses5 and currently there is no effective treatment after a relapse6. In addition, TNBC is more aggressive than other types of breast cancer, which is likely to metastasize to the lungs and brain7, 8. So patients with TNBC usually have a poor prognosis and a shorter overall survival compared to other subtypes of breast cancer. New therapies targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), angiogenesis, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), proteasome, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), histone deacetylase (HDAC), Src kinase, Wnt signaling, and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are being actively investigated in clinical trials in patients with TNBC9\u201311. But many of these efforts are not reaching the hoped results, and to date, not a single targeted therapy has been approved for the treatment of TNBC. Therefore, new targeted therapies are in urgent needed for patients with TNBC.",
                "One potential target of TNBC is protein kinase C (PKC), which is a serine/threonine protein kinase family of enzymes and plays critical roles in several disease processes including cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, heart failure, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and many other important human diseases12. An inverse relationship between ER and PKC activity and abundance in human breast cell lines and tumors has been firmly established13\u201315. PKC is also elevated in malignant versus normal breast tissue16, 17, and overexpression of PRKCA (PKC\u03b1) is associated with antiestrogen resistance18, 19 and tumor aggressiveness20. PRKCA is shown to be a central signaling node and therapeutic target for breast cancer stem cells21, which share similar profile of cell surface markers with TNBC4. Furthermore, PRKCA is directly associated with TNBC both in cell lines and in patient tumors22, 23.",
                "All above findings imply that PKC plays important roles in TNBC and could be a potential specific therapeutic target for TNBC. However, no studies of the anti-cancer effect of PKC inhibitors specifically targeting TNBC have been reported. One of the most specific PKC inhibitors developed is chelerythrine24, a natural benzophenanthridine alkaloid isolated from Chelidonium majus and possesses diverse pharmacological activities including potent anti-cancer and cytotoxic activities25, 26. Here, we report the selective anti-proliferative activity of chelerythrine against TNBC cell lines. Our data suggest that chelerythine or other PKC inhibitors may be promising regimens for TNBC tumors."

As shown in Fig.\u00a01A and Table\u00a01, chelerythrine inhibited the growth of TNBC cell lines dose-dependently, with IC50 values of 2.6\u2009\u03bcM to 4.2\u2009\u03bcM respectively. On the contrary, the tested non-TNBC cell lines were relative resistant to chelerythrine treatment compared to TNBC cell lines. The IC50 values of all four non-TNBC cell lines were greater than 10\u2009\u03bcM, and two of the four cell lines, MDA-MB-453 and ZR-75-1, did not show any inhibitory effect even at the highest concentration tested. When treated with 5\u2009\u03bcM of chelerythrine, all four TNBC cell lines demonstrated significant reduction of cell growth in a time dependent manner, while the four non-TNBC cell lines showed much less inhibition of cell growth at each time point (Fig.\u00a01B). So TNBC cells lines are more sensitive to chelerythrine treatment compared to non-TNBC cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The selective anti-proliferative activity of chelerythrine on TNBC cells were further confirmed by colony formation assay (Fig.\u00a01C). Colony formation ability of TNBC cells were dramatically decreased after treatment with chelerythrine for 3\u2009hours and almost no cells grew into colonies after 6\u2009hours, while non-TNBC cells reserved largely of their colony formation ability even after treatment for 48\u2009hours.Figure 1Chelerythrine selectively inhibits proliferation of TNBC cell lines in vitro.

There were also no obvious changes in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, marginal but significant increase of the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase in HCC1937 cells, and marked increase in G2/M phase in MDA-MB-468 cells (Supplementary Figure\u00a01A and B). So chelerythrine affect cell cycle distribution is cell line dependent, indicating other mechanisms existed for its selectivity on inhibition of TNBC cell growth. It is notable that a substantial proportion of nuclei had a sub-G0/G1 DNA content characteristic of apoptosis upon chelerythrine treatment in all TNBC cell lines, which implies induction of apoptosis could be the cause of selectively anti-proliferative effect of chelerythrine against TNBC cells.",
                        "Chelerythrine has been reported to induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells31, osteosarcoma cells32, squamous cell carcinoma lines33 and melanoma cells34. So we evaluated whether apoptosis is accounted for the selective anti-proliferative activity of chelerythrine on TNBC cells. As expected, chelerythrine indeed caused chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, the typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis, in TNBC cells but not in non-TNBC cells as visualized by Hoechst staining (Fig.\u00a02A). This was further evidenced by the detection of the cleaved nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP), a marker of apoptosis, in TNBC cell lines compared with non-TNBC cell lines after treatment with chelerythrine by western blotting (Fig.\u00a02B). We then quantified the apoptotic cell fractions by flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide double staining after 24\u2009hours incubation with chelerythrine. The mean percentages of apoptotic cells after chelerythrine treatment of TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468 were 67.8%, 51.0%, 22.2% and 35.3% respectively, whereas all four non-TNBC cell lines remained viable under the same treatment (Fig.\u00a02C). The induction of apoptosis with chelerythrine treatment in TNBC cells was also time-dependent as exemplified by MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a02D). In short, the distinct apoptosis induction activity of chelerythrine on TNBC cells versus non-TNBC cells contributes to its selective anti-proliferative activity on breast cancer cells.Figure 2Chelerythrine selectively induces apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. Four non-triple-negative breast cancer (Non-TNBC) cell lines (MCF7, ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-453) and four triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT549, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468) were treated with chelerythrine (CHE, 5\u2009\u03bcM) for 24\u2009hours.

                        "Chelerythrine is known as a highly specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, a family of serine/threonine protein kinase enzymes consisting of at least 12 members that can be categorized into four subgroups specified by their divergent regulatory domains35. All the PKC isozymes share a highly conserved kinase/catalytic domain that chelerythrine can interact with and thus inhibits their activities36. So we reasoned that one or more PKC isozymes are highly expressed and required for proliferation in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells. By inhibiting the PKC subtype(s), chelerythrine selectively suppresses the growth of TNBC cells.",
                        "Among all 12 isotypes of PKC, PRKCA, is the only isoform that has been associated with TNBC both in cell lines and in patient tumors22, 23. So we first checked the expression levels of PRKCA in breast cancer cell lines. However, PRKCA was only highly expressed in two of the TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, as manifested by both the mRNA level (Supplementary Figure\u00a02A) and the protein level (Supplementary Figure\u00a02B). Which was consistent with the fact that only in these two cell lines, colony formation was significantly decreased when PRKCA was knocked down by lentivirial-mediated shRNA (Supplementary Figure\u00a02C and D). The data implies that the selective anti-proliferative activity of chelerythrine on TNBC cell lines cannot be fully explained by the expression levels of PRKCA.",
                        "Since chelerythrine is a pan PKC inhibitor, we then proposed that other PKC subtypes may also be essential in TNBC cell proliferation. We retrieved gene expression profile data of 12 PKC isozymes in 56 human breast cancer cell lines, including 26 TNBC cell lines and 30 non-TNBC cell lines, from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database28. Besides PRKCA, we identified two other PKC subtypes, PKN1 and PKN2, which were significant higher in TNBC cell lines than in non-TNBC cell lines (Fig.\u00a03A). PKN1 mRNA was significantly higher in TNBC cell lines, however the protein level was not (data not shown). PKN2 mRNA level was higher in all four TNBC cell lines than non-TNBC cells even though it was not significant in MDA-MB-231cells (Fig.\u00a03B). It was confirmed by western blotting analysis of PKN2 proteins in breast cancer cell lines tested in this study (Fig.\u00a03C). It is notable that PKN2 is one of the highest expressed PKC isoforms in breast cancer cell lines (Fig.\u00a03A), implicating the importance in tumorigenesis. So we focused on PKN2 as the main target of chelerythrine in this study.Figure 3PKN2, one of PKC isozymes, is highly expressed in TNBC cells.

                "In summary, we have shown that chelerythrine selectively inhibits proliferation of TNBC cell lines both time- and dose-dependently, which was consistent with dramatic decrease of colony formation in TNBC cell lines treated with chelerythrine. We further demonstrated that the selective anti-proliferative activity of chelerythrine on TNBC cells is resulted from substantial induction of apoptosis. Finally, chelerythrine significantly inhibited in vivo xenograft formation and increased the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy agent taxol against TNBC cell lines. Our data suggest chelerythrine might be a promising regimen selectively targeting TNBC tumors which warranted further study.",
                "We found PKN2 is the only PKC isoform highly expressed in all TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines tested in this study (Fig.\u00a03B and C), and suppression of PKN2 significantly decreased colony formation (Fig.\u00a04B) and xenograft growth (Fig.\u00a04C) in TNBC cells, indicating PKN2 is the target of chelerythrine responsive for its selective activity on TNBC cells. PKN2 plays important roles in cellular processes, including cell cycle progression37, actin cytoskeleton assembly38, cell adhesion39, tumor cell migration and invasion40 and apoptosis41, 42. Our findings indicate that PKN2 is required for TNBC cells growth, which could be a potential diagnostic biomarker or a therapeutic target for TNBC. However, the hypothesis was only tested in limited cell lines in this study. It is needed to be further verified in more breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens.",
                "We also showed that PRKCA, the alpha isotype of PKC, was overexpressed in two TNBC cell lines tested in this study (Supplementary Figure\u00a02A and B), and knocking down PRKCA suppressed colony formation in the two cell lines (Supplementary Figure\u00a02D). Our data indicates that PRKCA is required for the growth in these two TNBC cell lines, which is consistent with the findings that PRKCA is associated with TNBC both in cell lines and in patient tumors22, 23. So even though we identified PKN2 as the possible target of cherethrine responsive to the selective activity against TNBC cells, we still cannot rule out other PKC isozymes, like PRKCA, also play roles in the phenomenon observed in this study. Further studies are needed to clarify the functions of each individual PKC isoform in TNBC tumor development. Combined inhibition of PKC isoforms will be a more precise approach to TNBC tumors based on expression and function of certain PKC isozymes. In fact, there is still a long way to reach the goal, as rare PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors are available43, 44. However, simultaneously inhibiting all isozymes by pan PKC inhibitors, like chelerythrine, is still worth to try on TNBC tumors. As we showed greater activities of chelerhthrine on cell growth (Fig.\u00a01) and induction of apoptosis (Fig.\u00a02) in TNBC cell lines overexpressing both PKN2 and PRKCA (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) in general.",
                "We have also shown that chelerythrine selectively induces apoptosis in TNBC cell lines tested in this study. PKN2 is rapidly and specifically cleaved by caspase-3 within its regulatory domain, during the induction of apoptosis41. And the cleaved C-terminal peptide of PKN2 binds to Akt and down regulates its kinase activity, resulting in the amplification of pro-apoptotic signalling in the cell42. PRKCA exhibits anti-apoptotic function by suppressing p53 dependent activation of IGFBP345 or by phosphorylation of Bcl246. It will be interesting to test whether chelerythrine induce apoptosis through regulation of these pathways. On the other hand, chelerythrine has been reported inducing apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-247, by dephosphorylation of ERK and Akt48, by activation of p5349, by inhibiting the expression of cytoprotective proteins HSF1 and hsp7031, by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)50, 51, and so on. It will also be interesting to test whether inhibition of PKC, especially PKN2 and PRKCA isoforms, either individually or simultaneously, leading to apoptosis through these pathways.",
                "Most of breast cancer survivors died from noncancer causes, especially for those 50 years and older. And among these causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the greatest single factor, accounting for approximately 35% of noncancer mortality52. CVD caused death is associated with breast cancer treatments, like radiotherapy53, HER2 targeted therapy54, and chemotherapy55. Compared to non-TNBC patients, TNBC patients have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity56\u201359, both are well known as CVD risk factors. While PKC activation is well documented in CVD developmet60, 61, and chelerythrine has been reported to improve diabetes induced endothelial dysfunction in rats62. All these evidences may add to the value of chelerythrine for TNBC treatment. Which could benefit the patients not only by inhibiting tumor growth, but also by improving CVD complications."
