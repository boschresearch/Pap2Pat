                                "Starch synthase (SS), including soluble starch synthase (SSS), is a key enzyme in starch deposition and storage in plants. Starch synthesis occurs in plastids of leaves during daylight using carbon fixed through photosynthesis, which is then mobilized to the storage organs at night. Starch consists of two D-glucose homopolymers: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear chain of a (1-4) linked D-glucose monomers and generally makes up \u02dc30% of starch. Amylopectin is a highly branched monomer joining linear chains made by a (1-6) linkages. Starch biosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts in green photosynthetic tissues, and in non-green tissue amyloplasts, such as endosperm. In the endosperm of a seed, biosynthesis of amylopectin requires a properly coordinated series of enzymatic reactions which involve the enzymes including ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), four different soluble starch synthases (SSI-IV), starch branching enzyme (BE), and starch debranching enzyme (DBE), whereas amylose biosynthesis requires only AGPase and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). There is a possibility that plastidial starch phosphorylase (Pho1) also plays an important role in primer formation in the starch biosynthesis reaction. In higher plants, AGPase produces ADP-Glc and pyrophosphate (PPi) from Glc-1-P and ATP. Starch synthase enzymes make linear glucan chains by transferring glucosyl units of ADP-Glc to the non-reducing end of a glucan chain. In cereal endosperm, a number of isoforms of starch synthase enzymes have been identified, including GBSS, SSI, SSII, SSIII and SSIV. GBSS has two isoforms that are mostly confined to storage tissue and involved in amylose synthesis, whereas different starch synthase isoforms, along with some amylose, are predominantly involved in formation of amylopectin. In rice, SSIIa and SSIIIa transcripts are most abundant during the grain filling phase, meanwhile SSIIb and SSIIIb transcripts are found in the pre-storage phase, indicating that SSIIa and SSIIIa may play vital roles in starch biosynthesis in rice compared to other SS enzymes. The presence of any one of the SSI or SSIIIa genes can continue starch biosynthesis in rice, although rice has only one SSI isoform. SSI has been shown to have higher activity than SSIIIa, and accounts for almost 70% of the total SS activity. Similar results have been found for the soluble fraction of wheat developing endosperm and maize endosperm. These observations suggest that SSI is critical for starch biosynthesis. SSI preferentially synthesizes short sequences, while further chain elongation of amylopectin synthesis is performed by other SS enzymes.",
                                "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important staple crop for approximately 36% of the world's population. In a dry wheat seed, starch is the most abundant element accounting for 75-85% of grain dry weight. Thus, the grain yield (based upon seed number per unit area and individual seed weight) is largely dependent on starch deposition in the growing endosperm. However, elevated temperature has significant adverse effects on starch deposition in the endosperm during the grain filling stage of different crops, possibly by inactivating soluble starch synthase. For example, temperatures above 25\u00b0 C. significantly reduce soluble starch synthase enzyme activity in the wheat endosperm. Of the total wheat production in the world, 40% is affected by terminal heat stress. Heat stress usually affects wheat production by reducing the yield and quality. Thus, there is a need in the art for improving the heat tolerance of various plants, including wheat, to heat stress."

                        "In more detail, the present invention is concerned with genetically-modified plants and methods of making and using the same to increase tolerance to heat stress in plants. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, references herein to a \u201cplant\u201d or \u201cplants\u201d includes tissues, organs, or parts thereof (e.g., leaves, stems, tubers, shoots, roots, blooms, buds), fruit, or cells thereof. Methods of creating such non-naturally occurring, genetically-modified plants (aka \u201ctransgenic\u201d plants) are also provided, along with nucleic acid constructs and vectors useful in such methods. The invention is suitable for use with various plants, including both monocotyledons (i.e., plants having one cotyledon (seed-leaf), aka \u201cmonocots\u201d) and dicotyledons (i.e., plants having two cotyledons, aka \u201cdicots\u201d). Non-limiting examples of plants suitable for the disclosed embodiments include grains (e.g., wheat, oat, barley, rice, maize, millet, rye, sorghum, triticale, buckwheat, quinoa), legumes (e.g., soybeans, beans, peas, alfalfa), tubers (e.g., potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, yam), and the like.",
                        "Heat stress occurs when a plant is subjected to elevated growing temperatures at least about 7\u00b0 C. higher than the normal plant growing temperatures for short durations such as hours or days and at least about 4\u00b0 C. higher for longer durations such as days and weeks. The present invention is particularly concerned with increasing tolerance to elevated temperatures encountered during the starch synthesis phase of plant growth (e.g., seed-filling stage). The term \u201celevated\u201d growing temperatures, in the context of the invention, refers to temperatures at or above which plant growth and/or yield, including endogenous starch synthase activity in the plant, is decreased or inactivated. \u201cNormal\u201d plant growing conditions or temperatures refers to condition or temperature ranges suggested for optimal growth and/or yield, which for most species are known in the art. For example, plants such as wheat prefer an optimal temperature of between about 15\u00b0 C. and about 20\u00b0 C. The optimum temperature for growth for plants such as maize is between about 20\u00b0 C. and about 23\u00b0 C. Plants such as sorghum prefer a daytime temperature of between about 25\u00b0 C. and about 28\u00b0 C. for reproductive growth. Plants such as soybean prefer a daytime temperature of about 29\u00b0 C. In general, preferred nighttime temperatures for most plants are about 2\u00b0 C. to about 5\u00b0 C. lower than daytime temperatures.",
                        "Genetically-modified plants according to the invention have increased tolerance to heat stress, where the term \u201ctolerance\u201d refers to the ability of the plant to continue growing and producing yield outside of its normal plant growing conditions. The heat tolerance of a transgenic plant is considered to be \u201cincreased\u201d when the transgenic plant's growth, development, and/or yield is superior to the growth, development, and/or yield of a control plant under the elevated growing temperatures, even if the transgenic plant is not completely resistant to or unaffected by the heat stress. Increased \u201cyield\u201d will depend upon the particular species of the modified plant and may manifest itself as one or more of the following: a) an increase in total seed weight, size, or volume, on an individual seed basis and/or per plant and/or per acre; b) increased thousand kernel weight (TKW), which is the weight in grams of one thousand kernels of wheat; c) increased number of flowers per plant; d) increased biomass; and/or e) increased harvest index, which is expressed as a ratio of the yield of harvestable parts, such as seeds, divided by the total biomass. An increased TKW may result from an increased seed size and/or seed weight, and may also result from an increase in embryo and/or endosperm size. The present invention is particularly concerned with improved plants having increased yield as compared to control plants grown under elevated temperatures during the starch synthesis stage of plant development.",
                        "Advantageously, unlike many other transgenic plants, plants according to the invention have a phenotype/morphology that is otherwise substantially similar to, and in some cases, nearly identical to wild type plants of the same species (when such wild type plants are grown under non-stress conditions). In other words, the shape, size, and/or abundance of seed, foliage and/or fruit/vegetable is substantially similar between the transgenic plants and wild type plants. Plants are considered to be \u201csubstantially similar\u201d herein if those skilled in the art have difficulty visually distinguishing between the genetically-modified plant and the control plant when grown under identical normal growing conditions. In contrast, when grown under heat stress, transgenic plants according to the various embodiments of the invention, have significantly improved morphologies as compared to control plants grown under the same conditions. For example, the transgenic plant may have one or more of the following improved morphological or physical characteristics as compared to a control plant: vigorous growth, abundant foliage, longer primary roots, height, etc. when grown under heat stress. Thus, there is no detrimental effect on morphology or phenotype in the genetically-modified plants.",
                        "The genetically-modified plants comprise an exogenous nucleic acid encoding for a thermostable protein having starch synthase activity, and preferably soluble starch synthase activity. The term \u201csoluble starch synthase activity\u201d or \u201cstarch synthase activity\u201d refers to protein/enzyme biosynthesis of starch, such as soluble starch. The term \u201cexogenous\u201d is used herein to refer to a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., DNA, RNA), gene, or protein that originates from a source outside of (i.e., foreign to) the host plant into which it is introduced to create the transgenic plant. For example, the term as it is used in reference to expression of an encoding nucleic acid, refers to introduction of an exogenous encoding nucleic acid in an expressible form into the host plant. In other words, the nucleic acid is not native to and/or has not been derived from that particular plant. In contrast, the term \u201cendogenous\u201d is used herein interchangeably with \u201cnative\u201d and refers to nucleic acid sequences, genes, gene products, proteins, etc. that are naturally associated with or found in a control or wild-type plant.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the exogenous nucleic acid encoding the thermostable starch synthase protein is also heterologous. The term \u201cheterologous\u201d refers to genetic material derived from a source other than the referenced species, and is contrasted with \u201chomologous,\u201d which refers to genetic material derived from, naturally associated with, or native to, the species of the host plant (although not necessarily to the host plant itself). For example, in some embodiments of the invention, the transgenic plants are created by introducing genetic material encoding for a starch synthase from one species into a host plant of a different species, wherein the host plant expresses that heterologous gene product. Thus, since an exogenous nucleic acid molecule is heterologous with respect to the host plant, the transformed plant cells will contain transcripts of the nucleic acid molecules introduced that would not be detected in a control plant qualitatively or quantitatively (e.g., by PCR). If, on the other hand, an exogenous nucleic acid molecule is homologous with respect to the host plant, the transformed plants can be distinguished from control plants based upon additional expression of transcripts, which can be detected using \u201cquantitative\u201d PCR techniques. In the present invention, it is particularly advantageous to introduce heterologous nucleic acids encoding starch synthase, which are native to more heat tolerant or tropical plant species into more moderate, temperate, or cool weather plant species to increase their tolerance to heat stress. The starch synthase coding sequence can be isolated from the more heat tolerant plant, or a synthetic coding sequence (e.g., cDNA) can be synthesized based upon available genetic information for the more heat tolerant plants. Advantageously, expression or overexpression of the exogenous thermostable starch synthase increases the tolerance of the transformed plant to heat stress.",
                        "A protein is considered to be \u201cthermostable\u201d when the protein remains enzymatically active, such that the function and/or activity of the protein is maintained at a given temperature (usually an elevated temperature) without significant decrease in activity. In other words, a protein is thermostable at a given elevated temperature if it maintains its native folded (functional) conformation and is not denatured or otherwise rendered non-functional at such temperatures. Thus, in the context of the present invention, thermostable proteins are selected such that they will maintain starch synthase activity in the transformed plant cell(s) under elevated growing temperatures\u2014temperatures at or above which the endogenous starch synthase enzymes of the transformed plant typically have decreased starch synthase activity or even inactivity. That is, the exogenous thermostable proteins have a higher relative thermostability and are more \u201cthermotolerant\u201d than the endogenous proteins of the transformed plant. Suitable thermostable proteins can be selected for relative thermostability at temperatures ranging from about 4\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C. (and preferably 5\u00b0 C. to about 15\u00b0 C.) higher than the thermostability of the endogenous starch synthase enzymes of the host plant. For example, if the thermostability temperature of the endogenous starch synthase enzymes of the host plant is about 25\u00b0 C., then the plant can be transformed using an exogenous thermostable protein having thermostability at about 30\u00b0 C. to about 55\u00b0 C. However, it will be appreciated that the thermotolerant SS protein must also remain enzymatically active throughout a range of growing temperatures, and not be inactivated at lower temperatures. In one or more embodiments, suitable thermostable proteins will be enzymatically active at temperatures greater than about 55\u00b0 C., preferably from about 23\u00b0 C. to about 55\u00b0 C., and more preferably from about 23.5\u00b0 C. to about 43.5\u00b0 C. (75\u00b0 F.-110\u00b0 F.). Thus, starch synthase genes can be identified or isolated from plants having a higher relative thermostability and then used to transform plants having a lower intrinsic relative thermostability, thereby increasing the heat stress tolerance of the modified plant. Thermostability can be predicted using a publicly-available algorithm (ThermoRank, accessible via www.abl.ku.edu/services) developed by Li et al. at the Kansas University Applied Bioinformatics Lab, and the relative thermostability of several species is shown in the working examples below. In one or more embodiments, starch synthase genes and/or starch synthase proteins native to plants such as rice, cottonwood, grapes, sorghum, soybean, maize, common beans, algae, clover, amaranth, arabidopsis, cocoa, tomatoes, cassava, alfalfa, chickpeas, and/or peaches can be used to increase the heat tolerance of less heat tolerance plants.",
                        "Transformation techniques for plants are well known in the art and include any technique involving the uptake of exogenous genetic material by the plant, such as particle bombardment-mediated delivery, Agrobacterium-mediated techniques, PEG- or electroporation-mediated uptake, viral infection, and/or microinjection.",
                        "In some embodiments, the tolerance to heat stress is increased by expressing in the plant a nucleic acid which comprises (or consists of): (a) a nucleotide sequence encoding a thermostable SS protein comprising (or consisting of) SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, or (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a thermostable SS protein having at least about 50% amino acid identity (preferably at least about 70% amino acid identity, and more preferably at least about 80% amino acid identity) to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and retaining the functional characteristics thereof. The \u201cfunctional characteristics\u201d of the thermostable SS proteins refers to the ability of the expressed protein or enzyme to remain enzymatically active to synthesize (soluble) starch at the elevated growing temperatures. In one or more embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises (or consists of) a sequence selected from the group consisting of (a) a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7; and (b) a nucleotide sequence having at least about 70% sequence identity (preferably at least about 80% sequence identity, and more preferably at least about 90% sequence identity) to SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (i.e., conservatively modified variants thereof). Thus, \u201cconserved variants\u201d of the disclosed nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are contemplated herein, as long as the resulting proteins or enzymes retain starch synthase activity.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the method of increasing the tolerance of a plant to heat stress comprises introducing and expressing in a plant cell a nucleic acid construct encoding thermostable protein having starch synthase activity.

                                "Starch synthase (SS), including soluble starch synthase (SSS), is one of the key enzyme components that shows sensitivity to high temperature during starch deposition and grain growth. In wheat, temperatures above 25\u00b0 C. reduce soluble starch synthase activity in wheat endosperm. However, there are significant differences in sensitivity to high temperatures among soluble starch synthases of different plant species. For example, rice soluble starch synthase is able to maintain a high enzyme activity at 35\u00b0 C., resulting in production of long, linear chain amylopectin in the endosperm. Since wheat soluble starch synthase is deactivated at elevated temperature and rice soluble starch synthase withstands high temperature, expression of a rice soluble starch synthase gene in wheat may increase the sink strength and thereby increase the productivity under heat stress. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of expression of a rice soluble starch synthase gene on starch deposition and the yield of wheat kernel weight under heat stress conditions. The SSI gene cloned in wheat had 81% amino acid similarity with rice SSI and produced a 75 kDa protein, whereas rice SSI produces a 57 kDa protein. The wheat and rice SSI are structurally similar, consisting of 15 exons and 14 introns. The exons of both genes are virtually identical in length, but introns 1, 2, 4 and 10 of wheat SSI are longer and introns 6, 11 and 14 are shorter than that of the corresponding rice introns.",

For transformation, plasmid pAHC20 was used in combination with constructs pAHC17 or pJL10P5. Genetic transformation was performed using a particle inflow gun. After particle bombardment, tissues were kept on the CM4 media for two to five days to allow better recovery. Wheat calli were then transferred onto selection media (CM4 media containing 5 mg/L glufosinate ammonium) and maintained for two weeks in the dark. The tissues were transferred to CM4 media containing 10 mg/L glufosinate ammonium in darkness for two cycles of 14 days each.

Southern analysis using genomic DNA from T2 leaves and the SSI gene sequence as a probe demonstrated that all three transgenic events and the non-transgenic BW had three bands in common (FIG. 2), indicating that probe hybridized with wheat endogenous SSI gene sequences and, due to its hexaploid nature, the wheat genome harbors three homologous SSI genes (copies). Each lane of the transgenic events also showed additional unique bands (FIG. 2), confirming transgene integration. Based on the uncommon band numbers, Ub1 and Dy10 transgenic events appeared to harbor only a single SSI gene insertion (single copy), while, Ub2 seems to harbor three copies of the rice gene.

The Dy10 promoter event and the non-transgenic BW did not show any bands (FIG. 3a), indicating that, as expected, the Dy10 promoter is seed specific. The seeds of non-transgenic BW did not show the rice SSI band, while the seeds of all three independent events showed a clear rice SSI band, indicating that both ubiquitin and Dy10 promoters were active in the seeds of the transgenic plants.

None of the transgenic events showed significant variation for seed number per head in any temperature condition. Towards the end of the experiment for optimum temperature condition, a malfunction of the growth chamber produced extreme high temperature. As a result, we have disregarded the results of thousand kernel weight under optimum temperature condition.",

                                "Previous work has demonstrated that the SSI gene is responsible for the elongation of shorter A and B1 chains during starch biosynthesis in the soluble phase of the amyloplast. As a result, the mutation of the SSI gene or destruction of that enzyme may have a severe impact on crystalline amylopectin matrix formation, as well as grain filling. Here we tested the hypothesis by using the high temperature (35\u00b0 C.) tolerance of the rice SSI gene to increase the grain filling potential of wheat under moderately high temperature. In this experiment we introduced the rice SSI gene into a spring wheat variety (BW) using two different promoters, which was confirmed by PCR and genomic DNA blotting in the T2 generation (FIG. 3a). Molecular analysis (Southern blot) revealed three copies of the endogenous SSI gene in wheat, because the non-transgenic Bobwhite, along with all the transgenic events, produced three common hybridization bands with the probe for the rice SSI gene (FIG. 3a). This indicates the high level similarity of rice SSI and wheat endogenous SSI. In addition blast analysis of the rice SSI cDNA sequence (Blast 2 sequence program) reveals 88% nucleotide identity and 81% amino acid identity with the wheat SSI gene. The failure of the event with the DY10 promoter to produce a band using cDNA from the leaf sample (FIG. 3b) in Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR proved the promoter specific expression of the transgene. In western blot analysis, separation of wheat SSI from Rice SSI was not possible because of the size similarity of the two proteins. Previous work has reported that the rice SSI protein produced a 57 KD protein band, but in our western gel, it produced a nearly 75KD band which is similar to the 75 KD wheat SSI band. Using the cDNA sequence of rice SSI we found the expected size of the protein as 75.7 KD, which is supportive of our finding. Two protein bands in the leaf protein support the expression of two isoforms of SSI in wheat leaf tissue, but only one isoform in seeds.",
                                "Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rice SSI gene with increased activity under heat will supplement the wheat SSI under high temperature stress and increase the individual grain weight by sustaining starch biosynthesis.",
                                "Three transgenic lines expressing the rice SSI gene produced significantly heavier seeds compared to non-transgenic lines under three different experiments at high temperature. Some transgenic events produced slightly heavier seed under optimum temperature in some experiments. This may be due to fluctuation of the highest temperature of the growth chambers. We observed actual temperature were somewhat elevated relative to the set temperature, which might have influenced the SSI activity. There was no variation among transgenic and non-transgenic event in optimum temperature conditions in Exp. 2 which was conducted in the greenhouse during winter. The actual temperature never exceeded the set point in this experiment. It may be possible the wheat SSI activity starts declining at around 25\u00b0 C. or an even lower temperature. It was clear that the TKW differential between the transgenic and non-transgenic lines increased (Table 3) as the heat stress was increased from Exp.1 to Exp.2 to Exp. 3. This result also supports the hypothesis that increasing temperature decreases wheat SSI activity more than rice SSI and also supports previous research regarding the importance of SSI activity related to grain filling.",
                                "No significant variation in chlorophyll content (Data not shown) was observed between transgenic and non-transgenic events indicating that differences of starch deposition were not due to the differences in photosynthetic capacity. This result is in line with earlier work that reported that reduced grain filling during high temperature was not due to the supply of the assimilate from photosynthesis.",
                                "No variation in tiller number (Tables 4 and 8) and height of the plants (visual measurement) indicates that the transgene did not compromise the morphology of the plants. Significantly lower seeds per spike were found with the transgenic event having the Dy10 promoter in experiment 1, 2 and 3 but not in experiment 4. This could be indicative of an interaction between Dy10 promoter and seed setting capability, or simply the product of insertion site of the gene or the effect of somaclonal variation, which might have been fixed with advancing the generation. There is no evidence in the literature supporting the idea that Dy10 promoter can compromise seed setting capability of a plant.",
                                "We did note a slight increase in time to physiological maturity for transgenic plants at the highest temperature tested. However, our data suggest that SSI activity was maintained under high temperature and likely allowed continued use of photo-assimilate. The increased grain fill duration we observed may be due to reduction of feedback inhibition of photosynthesis by reducing the accumulation of sugars.",
                                "The transgene with the Dy10 promoter produced the heaviest seeds and had longest grain filling duration (GFD). This result may support the feedback inhibition theory. Although we observed that some Dy10 plants also produced fewer seeds per spike and total grain yield was reduced, this is likely as an artifact based on the gene insertion site as this was not observed in all Dy10 plants. This somaclonal variation can be addressed with advancement of the wheat lines.",
                                "Our results suggest that incorporation of more heat stable forms of key enzymes may be a good strategy for improving heat tolerance in crop plants. This approach should be beneficial for all cool season species that are grown under conditions where heat stress may limit production. It may be useful to explore the relative heat stability of SS from other species typically grown under high temperature conditions to identify the most heat tolerant source of the enzyme.",
                                "There is genetic variability within wheat for the ability to maintain greenness under heat stress. The cultivar used in this study is not particularly tolerant to heat stress. Deployment of the rice construct in lines that demonstrate heat tolerance may be an avenue to even greater levels of production under heat stress.",

The Wins score-value is the relative (weighted) value assigned to the sequences. Comparing several protein sequences of starch synthases in Genbank it is predicted that the protein for rice has greater thermostability than the starch soluble synthase from wheat (Table 1). Our data from the transgenic lines of wheat expressing the modified rice (Oryza sativa) SSS gene corroborates this prediction. The SSS protein sequences of Triticum aestivum (SEQ ID NO:36), A. tausachii (SEQ ID NO:37), and Hordeum vulgare (SEQ ID NO:38) are predicted to be the least thermostable of all genes analyzed.",
