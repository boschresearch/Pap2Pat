    "title": "Expression of a rice soluble starch synthase gene in transgenic wheat improves the grain yield under heat stress conditions",
    "date": "2018-03-06",
    "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a temperate cereal with an optimum temperature range of 15\u201322\u00b0C during the grain filling stage. Heat stress is one of the major environmental constraints for wheat production worldwide. Temperatures above 25\u00b0C during the grain filling stage significantly reduced wheat yield and quality. This reduction was reported due to the inactivation of the soluble starch synthase, a key heat-labile enzyme in starch transformation of wheat endosperm. To improve wheat productivity under heat stress, the rice soluble starch synthase I, under the control of either a constitutive promoter or an endosperm-specific promoter, was expressed in wheat and the transgenic lines were monitored for expression and the effects on yield-related traits. The results showed that the transgenic wheat events expressed rice soluble starch synthase I at a high level after four generations, and transgenic plants produced grains of greater weight during heat stress. Under heat stress conditions, the thousand kernel weight increased 21\u201334% in T2 and T3 transgenic plants compared to the non-transgenic control plants. In addition, the photosynthetic duration of transgenic wheat was longer than in non-transgenic controls. This study demonstrated that the engineering of a heat tolerant soluble starch synthase gene can be a potential strategy to improve wheat yield under heat stress conditions.",

                "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important main food crops worldwide. It provides approximately 20% of the calories consumed by humans (Pfeifer et al. 2014). Given the socioeconomic importance of wheat, many efforts of breeding have focused on improving its yield, quality, and adaptability to biotic and abiotic stresses. Generally, wheat yield and quality can be affected by various environmental constraints such as high temperature, drought, or the combination of these two (Wardlaw et al. 2002; Stratonovitch and Semenov 2015). With global climate changes, the frequency of extreme high temperatures is expected to increase and negatively impact crop production, especially for cold season crops (Pradhan et al. 2012). It is reported that for every 1\u00b0C rise above the optimum temperature during the grain filling stage, wheat yield is reduced 3 to 4% (Wardlaw et al. 1989). Ever-increasing evidence in the past decades has demonstrated that elevated temperature during wheat anthesis and grain filling stages significantly reduces grain yield (Bhullar and Jenner 1986a; Keeling et al. 1993; Farooq et al. 2011; Prasad and Djanaguiraman 2014). Even short-term heat stress could cause an 11\u201323% reduction in grain number and 10\u201326% reduction in individual grain sizes (Talukder et al. 2013). In the Great Plains regions of the USA, high temperature stress is not uncommon during early reproductive development and grain filling periods of wheat when wheat is most susceptible to extreme temperatures (Assad and Paulsen 2002). Improving the heat tolerance in wheat has been considered a key goal that would result in yield stability (Kuchel et al. 2007).",
                "A major component of wheat seeds is starch, which accounts for 55\u201375% of total dry grain weight (Gillies et al. 2012). Therefore, the grain yield depends largely on starch accumulation in the seed endosperm (Jenner et al. 1991). Several processes in starch deposition during the grain filling stage have been identified in response to heat stress. Starch granules in higher plants usually contain two classes of glucose polymers, amylose, and amylopectin. In wheat, amylose is a linear or less branched molecule with a low degree of polymerization comprising 25\u201330% of wheat grain starch, and amylopectin is a large and highly branched polymer comprising 70\u201375% of grain starch (Myers et al. 2000; James et al. 2003). Both amylose and amylopectin are synthesized from ADP-glucose (Myers et al. 2000). Soluble starch synthase (SSS) enzymes catalyze the extension of linear glucan chains by adding glucose units to the glucan non-reducing ends through \u03b1-1,4 linkages, and then starch branching enzymes cleave and reattach the glucan segments to form branches on the polymers (Jeon et al. 2010). In cereal endosperm, these genes have been divided into five classes, including the soluble SS I-IV (SSI, SSII, SSIII, and SSIV) and granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) (Hirose and Terao 2004).",
                "Previous studies indicated that the adverse effects of elevated temperature on starch deposition in wheat grain endosperm are likely due to the inactivation of starch synthesis (Bhullar and Jenner 1986a, b; Rijven 1986; Jenner 1994; Zhao et al. 2008; Prakash et al. 2009) and that soluble starch synthase I was the most heat-labile enzyme limiting the starch deposition in the biosynthetic pathway in seeds (Keeling et al. 1993; Jenner 1994; Sumesh et al. 2008; Prakash et al. 2009). In the developing endosperm, the expression levels of starch biosynthesis genes have been also reported to be early induced, but significantly suppressed by heat stress (Hurkman et al. 2003). Genetic engineering of such key enzymes to increase their thermostability might be an alternative approach to improve the starch biosynthesis under heat stress conditions.",
                "The soluble starch synthase genes from a subtropical species, rice (Oryza sativa L.), could be good candidates to be introduced into wheat by genetic engineering. Previous studies in rice have demonstrated that the predominant SSI was stable and active at high temperature up to 35\u00b0C, resulting in increased production of long chain of amylopectin in the endosperm (Jiang et al. 2003). The presence of either SSI or SSIIIa gene could sustain the starch biosynthesis in rice, and SSI may have higher activity than SSIIIa, accounting for almost 70% of the total SS activity (Fujita et al. 2006; Fujita et al. 2011). A similar phenomenon observed in maize, the purified SSI enzyme showed a higher heat stability than SSIII at an incubation temperature of 42\u00b0C (Huang et al. 2016). The rice SSI presents only one isoform in rice (Baba et al. 1993; Hirose and Terao 2004) and shares 81% amino acid similarity with wheat SSI that produces a 75-kDa protein (Li et al. 1999; McMaugh et al. 2014).",
                "The present report evaluated the overexpression of the rice SSI gene in transgenic wheat. The transgenic plants had significantly enhanced grain yield under heat stress during the grain filling stage, likely due to higher starch deposition resulting in greater kernel weight compared to the non-transgenic wheat. These results demonstrate that engineering heat-sensitive key enzymes can be a useful strategy for improving the heat tolerance of cold season crops, and for developing food crops adapted to an increasingly changed environment."

Thousand kernel weight (TKW) was obtained from the tagged tillers by drying to equivalent moisture content, weighing the seeds and converting to TKW using the seed number of that tagged head. The number of effective tillers was also counted during harvest. Chlorophyll content was measured as described by Uauy et al.

Days required for physiological maturity were calculated from date of anthesis to date of physiological maturity (based on 50% of stems turning yellow).

To determine the relative thermostability of the rice SSI protein, the amino acid sequences of rice (UniPort database: Q0DEC8) and wheat SSI (Genbank Accession ID: AAD54661) were compared to each other (Fig.\u00a02). Using a novel scoring algorithm to compare relative thermostability of proteins using an integrated statistical and machine learning approach (Li et al. 2010), it was predicted that the rice SSI protein was more thermostable than the wheat SSI protein (data not shown). This result agrees with previous reports that the wheat soluble SSI enzyme is heat-labile based on bioassays (Keeling et al. 1993; Jenner 1994; Sumesh et al. 2008; Prakash et al. 2009). To test the hypothesis that the expressed heat-stable rice SSI gene in wheat would improve the grain filling potential of wheat under moderate heat stress, the rice SSI gene was selected and introduced into the Bobwhite wheat variety.Figure 2.Amino acid sequence comparison for two SSI enzymes from wheat (Ta_SSI: 647aa) and rice (Os_SSI: 641aa).

                        "To confirm the transgene expression in wheat plants, RT-PCR was conducted using total RNA isolated from both leaf and seed samples of the three transgenic lines and non-transgenic Bobwhite. The leaf samples from Ub1 and Ub2 produced a band matching the expected size from the rice SSI gene, while the Dy10 event and the non-transgenic BW did not show any bands (Fig.\u00a04A). The failure of the Dy10 event to produce a band using cDNA from the leaf sample was due to the tissue specificity of the Dy10 promoter as expected. The seeds of non-transgenic BW did not show any bands, while the seed samples of all three independent events showed expected rice SSI bands (Fig. 4A). It confirmed the expression of the rice SSI gene driven by both Ubi1 and Dy10 promoters in the transgenic wheat. Single tubulin bands with different sizes between genomic DNA samples and RNA samples demonstrated that RNA samples were not contaminated with DNA (Fig. 4B).Figure 4.RT-PCR for leaf samples (left) and seed sample (right) of Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019.

                        "Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the presence of SSI proteins in wheat. A rice leaf sample was included as a control. In western blot analysis, the differentiation between rice SSI from wheat SSI was not successful as the antibody bound to both rice and wheat proteins (Fig.\u00a05). This cross-reactivity was likely due to the high similarity of the amino acid sequences and length between the two proteins (Fig. 2). In seeds, only one SSI protein band was detected in the three transgenic events, non-transgenic BW, and rice. The SSI proteins showed a similar molecular weight (71\u00a0kDa) in both wheat and rice with stronger intensities in the transgenic wheat events than in non-transgenic wheat (Fig. 5A), indicating that the rice SSI protein was probably produced in the endosperm of all three transgenic wheat events. A previous study showed that the rice SSI protein produced a 57-kDa protein band (Baba et al. 1993). However, in the present study, an approximate 71-kDa band was detect by the western blot, which was similar to the 71-kDa wheat SSI band. The cDNA sequence of the rice SSI was used to query the UniProt database (www. Uniport.org), and the expected size of the protein (accession no. Q0DEC8) of 70.95\u00a0kDa was predicted, which was supportive of this current finding.Figure 5.Western blot analysis of seed and leaf samples from T2 generation of Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019. Three T2 generation transgenic events, one non-transgenic T. aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019 and one rice sample was used. Total proteins extracted from both leaf and seed samples were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS page gel) and transferred to PDVF membrane, probed with polyclonal antibody raised against rice SSI. Equal amount of total protein (40\u00a0\u03bcg) was loaded in each lane. In seed samples (A), all transgenic events along with rice showed stronger signal than non-transgenic wheat. The antibody bound with both wheat endogenous SSI and rice SSI protein. In leaf sample (B), antibody bound with two SSI isoforms of wheat. Comparing the signal strength of the second isoforms of SSI, Ub1, Ub2, and rice leaf sample showed enhanced signal for SSI.",
                        "In leaves, two SSI protein bands (isoforms 60 and 71\u00a0kDa) were detected in three transgenic events and non-transgenic BW. The 71-kDa SSI isoform showed stronger band intensity in the Ub2 event than in the Ub1 event, Dy10, and non-transgenic BW. However, the 50-kDa SSI isoform showed weaker band intensity in the Ub2 even than in the Ub1 event, Dy10, and non-transgenic BW (Fig. 5B). The results indicated that there were probably two isoforms of SSI in wheat leaf tissue, but only one isoform existed in seeds. This observation is consistent with a previous report that two SSI isoforms were expressed in wheat leaf tissues, and only one isoform in seeds (Denyer et al. 1995). Only the 71-kDa isoform was detected in rice leaf tissue (Fig. 5B)."

                        "Moderately high temperatures reduce the SSI activity of wheat at both the transcription (Hurkman et al. 2003) and enzyme activity levels (Rijven 1986), while the reduction of transcription and enzyme activity in rice is mild (Yamakawa et al. 2007). Accordingly, the transgenic wheat plants in the present study were placed under the elevated temperature to determine if the thermostable rice SSI could compensate for the low activity of wheat SSI during heat stress. Successful compensation would be expected to increase the individual grain weight by sustaining the enzyme activity. Based on previous molecular analysis above, all three events (Ub1, Ub2, and Dy10) positive for transgene (SSI) were used for heat stress bioassays. The PCR negative plants from different transgenic events (BWTC) and Bobwhite plants not derived from tissue culture (BWNTC) were used as controls.",
                        "Three independent experiments were conducted for phenotyping under increasing temperature ranges (31/24, 33/26, and 34/28\u00b0C with 16/8\u00a0h day/night) compared to optimal temperature conditions (22/15\u00b0C). In Exp. 1, T2 plants from Ub1, Dy10, and BWTC were exposed to heat stress at 31/24\u00b0C (day/night) from 10\u00a0d of anthesis until harvest. Significant differences were found for TKW for Ub1 (3.22%) and Dy10 (6.71%) events compared to BWTC (Table 2). Effective tiller number per plant and days required for physiological maturity showed no significant difference, but seed number per selected head was significantly lower for the Dy10 event (Table 2). Under optimum temperature conditions, there was no significant difference between transgenic and non-transgenic events for any studied traits (Fig.\u00a06).Table 2.Comparison of agronomic traits between transgenic plants and non-transgenic Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019 in heat stress Exp. 1Temp.Event name\u2020TKW (g)Seed number per selected headMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT stat31/24\u00b0CBWTC29.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2154.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.58Ub130.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.321.85*54.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.240.02Dy1031.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.833.47**41.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.032.54*22/15\u00b0CBWTC35.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.559.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5Ub137.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.961.9258.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.10.1Dy1037.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.891.1345.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.441.49TKW thousand kernel weight, BWTC non-transgenic Bobwhite but established through tissue culture, Ub1 event 1286 having ubiquitin promoter, Dy10 event 2173 having Dy10 promoter, STD standard deviation\u2020Number of plants studied in this experiment is accompanied by event name in parenthesis*, **, and *** denote P\u2009<\u20090.05, 0.01, and 0.001 respectivelyFigure 6.Phenotype comparison of transgenic lines and non-transgenic control lines.

                        "In Exp. 2, an increased temperature (33/26\u00b0C) was used for all three (Ub1, Ub2, and Dy10) transgenic events. Both BWTC and BWNTC were pooled as controls since there were no significant differences observed for the traits evaluated under heat and normal growing conditions. Transgenic events with the Ub1 (10.70%) and Dy10 (25.67%) promoters showed significant increases in TKW compared to control plants (Table 3). Individually, all events with the transgene had higher TKW than non-transgenic lines. The Dy10 event produced significantly lower number of seeds than non-transgenic control (BW) in both heat stress (33/26\u00b0C) and optimum temperature (22/15\u00b0C) conditions (Table 3). This result could be indicative of an interaction between the Dy10 promoter and seed setting capability, or simply the effect of somaclonal variation, which might have been fixed with advancing the generation. There was no evidence in the previous literatures suggesting that the Dy10 promoter would compromise seed setting capability. Additional events with the Dy10 promoter may be necessary to draw a more definite conclusion. Under optimum temperature conditions, tiller number and days required for physiological maturity were not significantly different (Table 3). Moreover, the Dy10 event took significantly longer to reach physiological maturity (32.66\u00a0d) under heat stress than non-transgenic events. It has been reported that pulling sugar from the leaf to seed helps to reduce feedback inhibition of leaf sugar on photosynthesis (Smidansky et al. 2002). It is possible that altered source-sink relationships resulted in a longer grain fill period, although additional events would need to be examined to draw a firm conclusion. In Exp. 3, an even higher temperature regime (34/28\u00b0C) was used in the bioassays with T3 plants. Under heat stress condition, transgenic events with both Ubi1 (22.94%) and Dy10 (34.59%) promoters produced seeds having significantly higher TKW (Tables\u00a03 and 4) and visibly larger kernels than non-transgenic events under heat stress condition (Fig.\u00a07). Comparably, the Dy10 event in T3 generation still produced lower number of seeds per selected head, while Ub1 and Ub2 events showed no difference compared to controls (Table 3). Tiller number per plant and chlorophyll content was not significantly different between transgenic and non-transgenic events (data not shown). Days required for physiological maturity differed significantly between transgenic and non-transgenic events, with transgenic events averaging 1.28 additional days of grain filling duration than non-transgenic plants. This observation infers the photosynthetic duration of the heat-stressed plants were longer than non-transgenic control plants.Table 3.Comparison of agronomic traits between transgenic and non-transgenic Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019 in Exp. 2 and Exp. 3 at different temperature rangesTemp.Event nameTKWSeed numbers per selected headPhysiological maturity (days)2nd experiment (high temp 33/26\u00b0C)3rd experiment (high temp 34/28\u00b0C)2nd experiment (high temp 33/26\u00b0C)3rd experiment (high temp 34/28\u00b0C)2nd experiment (high temp 33/26\u00b0C)3rd experiment (high temp 34/28\u00b0C)Mean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statHigh temperatureBWTC22.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.940.30120.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.650.13447.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.560.4846.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.740.3226.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.270.2522.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.300.63BWNTC22.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6719.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8946.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2448.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7327.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2222.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54BW22.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.73\u201320.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.14\u201346.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.20\u201347.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.23\u201327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.69\u201322.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.97\u2013Ub124.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.441.89*24.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.311.96*46.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.080.3150.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.800.4129\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.920.9323.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.891.59Ub225.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.351.88*25.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.463.50**49.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.470.4048.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.130.1728\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.450.6623.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.822.36*Ub24.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.842.41*24.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.243.30**47.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.410.2749.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.670.3828.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.071.0623.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.822.41*Dy1028.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.856.14***27.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.123.75**36.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.222.48*25.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.855.14**29.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.501.96*24.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.962.90*Optimum temperature 22/15\u00b0CBWTC40.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.270.14440.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.680.93239.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.18050.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.260.98940.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.791.3138.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.300BWNTC40.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0039.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2539.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6156.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3543\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9438.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.82BW40.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.41\u201340.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.46\u201339.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.70\u201353.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9\u201341.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.49\u201338.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.33\u2013Ub142.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.370.6843.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.281.7737.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.150.27653.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.060.10342\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.460.11536.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.421.10Ub240.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.361.8143.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.162.55*49.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.151.6753.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.540.10641\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.370.41437.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.190.69Ub41.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.570.29243.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.252.63**43.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.060.58753.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.350.12941.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.210.2036.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.611.16Dy1040.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.760.27644.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.541.8730.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.111.96*36.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.521.8741.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.640.5240.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.030.64The Ub observation combines the Ub1 and Ub2 observationsTKW thousand kernel weight, BWTC non-transgenic Bobwhite established through tissue culture, BWNTC non-transgenic Bobwhite not regenerated through tissue culture, Ub1 event 1286 having ubiquitin promoter, Ub2 event 1700 having ubiquitin promoter, Dy10 event 2173 having Dy10 promoter, STD standard deviation*, **, and *** denote P\u2009<\u20090.05, 0.01, and 0.001 respectivelyTable 4.Comparison of Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019 thousand kernel weight (TKW), TKW percent change, and mean seed number at high temperature and optimum temperature conditionsExperimentEventTKW% TKW incrementSeed number per selected headMean \u00b1 STDT statMean \u00b1 STDT statHeat stress (32\u201333/30\u00b0C)BW23.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8847.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7Ub126.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.551.39*13.5852.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.951.48Ub226.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.891.1112.0651.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.550.90Dy1030.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.382.94**29.5146.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.780.16Optimum temperature (20/15\u00b0C)BW34.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1047.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0Ub134.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.000.431.3150.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.410.47Ub235.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.780.952.7449.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.260.43Dy1037.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.212.979.6749\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.10.27STD standard deviation* and ** denote P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 0.01 respectivelyFigure 7.Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019 seed phenotype comparison under heat stress and normal temperature.

                        "In Exp. 4, the heat stress bioassay with a higher nighttime temperature and lower daytime temperature (32/33\u00b0C) was also performed. Similar to previous results, Ub1 (13.58%), Ub2 (12.06%), and Dy10 (29.51%) showed considerable increase in TKW than non-transgenic controls under high temperature (Table 4). There was high variability in kernel weight within the events; as a result, even though there was a remarkable increment in Ub1 and Ub2, they were not significantly different. None of the transgenic events showed significant variation for seed number per head in any temperature condition, indicating seed set was not affected. This result indicates such differences are probably due to starch deposition rather than compensation for reduced seed set.",
                        "Taken together, three transgenic lines produced significantly heavier seeds compared to non-transgenic lines under heat stress in three independent experiments. This data suggests that starch synthase activity was maintained under high temperature and likely allowed continuous starch accumulation. The increased grain fill duration observed at optimum temperature may be due to reduction of feedback inhibition of photosynthesis by reducing the accumulation of sugars. Under optimum temperature, some transgenic events produced slightly heavier seeds (but not significantly) compared to controls. This observation may be due to the additive effects with the rice SSI transgene, or, more likely, may indicate other wheat starch synthase genes are affected by temperature fluctuations within the growth chambers. Nonetheless, these experiments demonstrate SSI is likely the most important enzyme for sustaining starch synthesis under heat stress. There was no significant variation among transgenic and non-transgenic events in optimum temperature conditions. It was clear that the TKW differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic lines increased (Fig.\u00a08) as the temperatures were increased. These results support the hypothesis that wheat SSI enzyme is less stable than rice SSI at high temperature, and the additional stable rice SSI expressed in wheat is able to reduce the affect in grain yield by heat stress. It also supports previous research regarding the importance of SSI activity related to grain filling (Prakash et al. 2009). No significant variation in chlorophyll content was observed between transgenic and non-transgenic events, indicating that differences in starch deposition were not due to the differences in photosynthetic capacity. This result is in line with a previous report that reduced grain filling at high temperature was not likely due to the supply of the assimilate from photosynthesis (Sofield et al. 1977).Figure 8.Percent change in thousand kernel weight (TKW) compared to control for three independent experiments using Triticum aestivum L. cv. \u2018Bobwhite\u2019.

                "With global warming, abiotic stresses, especially heat and drought, could be a critical limiting factor for crop production. These results indicate that introduction of thermostable SSS in wheat could be a useful strategy for improving heat tolerance. This approach might be beneficial for other cool season species that are grown under conditions where heat stress may limit production. In addition, it is useful to explore the heat stability of SSS from other species typically grown under high-temperature conditions to identify the most heat-stable sources of the enzyme. It is also very useful to explore genetic variability within the wheat gene pool for the ability to maintain greenness under heat stress (Ristic et al. 2008). Research on heat tolerance in wheat has also focused on the ability to retain green leaf area under stress. This ability to retain photosynthetic capacity under stress is important. It may be necessary to identify and utilize heat-stable starch synthase enzymes to be able to fully take advantage of genetic mechanism that retain green leaf area and preserve photosynthetic function. The observation of increased grain fill of transgenic plants under the highest stress levels further indicates the connection between these traits needs to be explored more fully. New biotechnology, coupled with knowledge on starch metabolism, will help provide new strategies for improving the heat stress tolerance in wheat grains."
