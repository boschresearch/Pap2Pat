    "date": "2008-07-18 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Prior approaches have delivered O2 to a subject by inhalation, but the relationship between local signal changes and metabolism has been complicated by H217O created in non-cerebral tissues. During a brief pulse of 17O2 inhalation, this arterial input function for H217O is negligible due to convective transport delays. Additional delays in the arterial input function due to restricted diffusion of water makes pulsed inhalation of 17O2 even more effective. Accordingly, ventilator system are provided to deliver 17O2 as a brief pulse to a subject. Subsequent MR imaging demonstrates delayed appearance of H217O in the cerebral ventricles, suggesting that the arterial input function of H217O is delayed by restricted water diffusion in addition to convective transit delays. Delivery as a brief pulse therefore offers significant advantages in relating MR signal changes directly to metabolism.",

                        "Recently, several investigators have explored the use of 17O for magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). For example, see Arai et al. in \u201cCerebral oxygen utilization analyzed by the use of oxygen-17 and its nuclear magnetic resonance,\u201d Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Of the three naturally occurring isotopes of oxygen, only 17O, a stable non-toxic isotope, is NMR active. This nucleus has a 0.037% natural abundance, is relatively NMR insensitive, and has short relaxation times due to the quadrupolar interactions of the spin 5/2 nucleus. Gaseous 17O2, whether dissolved in plasma or tissue, or bound to hemoglobin, is invisible to NMR detection. The H217O that is produced from 17O2 metabolism, however, is detectable by NMR and can be measured either directly around the 17O Larmor frequency, or with greater sensitivity by measuring the changes in T2 or T1\u03c1 weighted proton NMR signal caused by 17O\u20141H scalar coupling and proton chemical exchange. In contrast to other methods for imaging CMRO2, therefore, 17O approaches can detect metabolically generated labeled water without any contributions to the signal from labeled molecular oxygen.",
                        "The simplest way to deliver 17O2 gas is by inhalation, as reported previously by Arai et al. in \u201cIn vivo oxygen-17 nuclear magnetic resonance for the estimation of cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption,\u201d Biochem.

Acad. Sci. USA 99: 13194-9, 2002. For quantitative measurement of CMRO2, gas mixtures enriched with 17O2 have been administered typically as a pulse over a time period ranging from 2 minutes to 40 minutes. During this period of inhaling gas enriched in 17O2, the 17O is delivered to all tissues and metabolized in the mitochondria to produce H217O. The change in local MRI signal is directly proportional to the amount of labeled water, and the rate of H217O production is in turn directly related to oxygen metabolism in the region of interest. The H217O, however, does not just accumulate at the site of its production in the mitochondria, but also diffuses out of the local tissue to the venous circulation. Additionally, H217O produced in tissues outside of the region of interest (ROI) diffuse to their local venous circulations, and are then convectively transported to arterial blood. This H217O produced in other tissues enters the ROI in the arterial circulation, and also diffuses into tissue in the local ROI. The resulting signal is therefore a complex combination of the water production from the local CMRO2 of interest, along with water migration into and out of the tissue. Interpreting the MRI signal in terms of local CMRO2 specifically, therefore, can be difficult.",
                        "The present invention is directed to an alternative approach that delivers the 17O2 in a very brief pulse, on the order of 1 minute or less. Owing to time lags for both convection and diffusion, H217O produced outside of the ROI should not have time to enter the ROI before local production of H217O has commenced. During a short enough delivery interval, therefore, the regional signal should be much simpler to interpret, primarily determined by water formed locally from the 17O2. However, systems for mechanical ventilation are not usually designed to make a sharp step change in gas concentration, for example the pulse of 17O2 desired in the CMRO2 application. Additionally, ventilator circuits are not usually provided with a way to selectively recover parts of exhaled gas, which is enriched with very expensive 17O2 during the pulsed administration. The present invention is directed to these needs in the art."

                        "According to one aspect of the present invention, methods of delivering 17O for the purpose of MRI imaging are provided. A pulse of 17O2 is administered by inhalation to a patient. The pulse comprises a step increase in 17O2 concentration. The step increase may be performed such that the patient is administered non-enriched oxygen followed by a step increase to approximately 100% 17O enriched oxygen. The duration of the pulse may be selected to be less than the diffusion time of metabolized H217O to the region of interest to be imaged. If the pulse has a properly chosen duration, then, owing to time lags for both convection and diffusion, H217O produced outside of the ROI should not have time to enter the ROI before local production of H217O has commenced. During a short enough delivery interval, therefore, the regional MR imaging signal should be much simpler to interpret, primarily determined by water formed from the 17O2 metabolized in the ROI. Accordingly, the duration of the pulse may be relatively short, for example, on the order of 30 to 60 seconds. MR imaging may be performed during this 30 to 60 second period in order to provide a regional NMR signal free of the effects of convection and diffusion. In addition, the need to measure the input function for 17O2 can be eliminated by monitoring exhaled breath.",
                        "According to another aspect of the present invention, apparatuses are provided to enable a pulse of 17O2 to be delivered by inhalation to a patient. Systems for mechanical ventilation are not usually designed to make a sharp step change in gas concentration, for example the pulse of 17O2 used in the described method. Creating a sharp step in gas concentration at the airway imposes several restrictions on the ventilator and the breathing circuit. Tubing diameters should be small to minimize transit times and minimize diffusive slurring of concentration fronts. Sudden expansions and contractions in tubing diameter, such as might be found in typical one-way valves, are to be avoided. Flow should be unidirectional with no rebreathing of exhaled gas. An exhalation pump is preferably used to maintain the exhaled gas at a pressure and adjusting the pump speed of the exhalation pump to maintain the output pressure. Additionally, ventilator circuits are not usually provided with a way to selectively recover parts of exhaled gas. Recovery of exhaled gas is desired, for instance, when the exhaled gas is enriched with very expensive 17O2 during the pulsed administration. A sampling bag that receives the exhaled gases after CO2 scrubbing may be used for this purpose. The apparatus for mechanical ventilation provided according to an aspect of the present invention is thus capable of making rapid step changes in gas concentration, and therefore may be used with 17O to image regional CMRO2. It should be understood that the ventilation system described herein may be used with other gases and for other applications in which rapid step changes in gas concentration are desired, and to provide recovery of exhaled gas, such as functional residual capacity (FRC) determination from inert gas washout."

                        "FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a system 100 for mechanical ventilation in accordance with the invention for providing provides sharp step changes in 17O2 concentrations and for recovering partially enriched exhaled 17O2. The inhalation stream select valve (inh) 102 selects either room air (RA) 104, 100% oxygen (16O2) 106, or an oxygen mixture enriched in 17O2 (17O2 sampling bag 108 attached to inh), under control of computer 110. The inhalation peristaltic pump (PPi) 112 pressurizes the selected gas and delivers it to the subject 113 in the MRI scanner 114, also under control of computer 110. Exhalation is actively assisted via the exhalation peristaltic pump (PPe) 116, according to the airway pressure transducer (Paw) 118. Exhaled gas is directed by the exhalation stream select valve (exh) 120 to either waste (W) or through a carbon dioxide absorbent (CO2) 122 to a recovered 17O2 sampling bag 124 attached to exh 120 as indicated in FIG. 1.",
                        "During operation of the system of FIG. 1, gases are pumped to and from the subject 113 by two large peristaltic pumps 112 and 116 (Cole Parmer, Chicago Ill.; Masterflex I/P digital drive with dual standard pump heads and silicone I/P 73 tubing), with pump 112 for assisting or controlling inhalation, and pump 116 for assisting or controlling exhalation. The pumps 112, 116 outside of the MRI scanner 114 are connected to the subject 113 inside the MRI scanner 114 by, for example, 25 feet of 0.25 inch ID Tygon\u00ae tubing 126 (Cole Parmer L/S 17). Pressure at the subject's airway is transmitted by 0.125 inch ID nylon tubing to pressure transducer 118 (Freescale Semiconductor, Chandler, Ariz., MPX2010DP) with signal amplification by a custom op-amp circuit (not shown). Information on airway pressure is transmitted by pressure transducer 118 via a multifunction DAQ device (National Instruments, Austin Tex., USB-6008) to computer 110, which uses feedback control to adjust the pump speeds for both pumps during assisted spontaneous ventilation and for the exhalation pump 116 during volume-controlled mechanical ventilation Inhaled gases are chosen via computer controlled stream select valve 102 (VICI Valco Instruments, Houston, Tex., Model C45) to select air 104, regular 100% O2 106, or oxygen with enriched 17O2 108. The oxygen gases are sealed in Tedlar\u00ae gas sampling bags (Cole Parmer). Exhaled air can be directed, via stream select valve 120 to either waste or to recovery of the partially enriched 17O2 gas sampling bag 124 during and after an administered pulse. Carbon dioxide absorbent 122 removes CO2 from the recovered, exhaled gas.",
                        "The long tubing connections between the mechanical components and the subject 113 required a significant departure from prior approaches to mechanical ventilation. Although a wide variety of ventilator modes are available from conventional ventilators, exhalation is almost universally passive, i.e. the exhalation pressure at the ventilator is set to a prescribed value and the lungs exhale passively against that exhalation pressure. Ventilator exhalation tubing is usually sized in a large enough diameter to make expiratory flow resistance negligible, thus keeping the pressure at the airway equivalent to the set exhalation pressure in the ventilator. For the system of FIG. 1, however, large bore exhalation tubing would greatly increase the circuit priming volume, and would also tend to slur any sharp concentration fronts in the exhalation limb, making clean recovery of partially enriched 17O2 more difficult. Passive exhalation, therefore, leads to design requirements for the exhalation tubing that are fundamentally at odds with the requirement for efficient use and recovery of the expensive 17O2 gas. The system depicted in FIG. 1 approaches these problems by actively assisting exhalation as well as inhalation. Pressure at the airway is monitored and fed back to the control system, which then adjusts the exhalation pump speed. The target exhalation pressure at the airway can then be specified at any given level, and for the subject it appears they are exhaling passively at that pressure, even though the pressure required at the end of the exhalation tubing varies markedly according to expiratory flow rate.",
                        "At the inspiratory side, mechanical ventilators typically have a gas bellows that slurs rapid step changes in gas concentration (see Huygen et al. in \u201cDesign and validation of an indicator gas injector for multiple gas washout tests in mechanically ventilated patients,\u201d Crit. Care Med. 18: 754-9, 1990), and again increases the circuit priming volume. Accordingly, an additional roller pump (not shown) was used to eliminate the reservoir volume and to avoid any large changes in tubing diameter, helping to preserve step changes in gas concentration. The use of inspiratory pump 112 also does not require pressurized gas sources, an advantage in developmental experimental work where a single mishap with a gas tank regulator could result in a large waste of precious 17O2 gas.",
                        "The system for mechanical ventilation as illustrated in FIG. 1 has been tested in two settings: (1) testing in a human volunteer in spontaneous ventilation mode, with use of helium as a surrogate for 17O2, and with monitoring of gas concentrations at the airway with a respiratory mass spectrometer; and (2) testing in an anesthetized pig with controlled ventilation, administration of 17O2, and MRI imaging of the brain."

The time response of the inlet system and mass spectrometer 128 were determined by placing the sample port in a stream of flowing gas, directly downstream of a switching valve (Valco Instruments Model C45), and switching the gas source from 0% to 100% helium.

If it is assumed that tidal gas mixes completely on entering the alveolus, the changes in average alveolar concentration will be determined by the inspiratory flow rate and the end-expiratory lung volume. Changes in alveolar gas concentrations due to blood uptake, both in inspiration and expiration, were neglected. The alveolar gas concentration was therefore modeled as increasing during the two 17O2 inhalations in two steps, with steady plateaus during exhalation. After the 17O2 breaths, the decrease in average alveolar concentration was modeled as a similar series of decays. Finally, the assumption was made that arterial gas concentrations follow the same time course as the alveolar gas changes, i.e. it was assumed that arterial 17O2 concentrations were in equilibrium with average alveolar 17O2 concentrations.",

Parameters for the gas dilution model include tidal volume and end-expiratory volume. Inspiratory tidal volume is measured from the calibrated output of the inhalation pump 102. As shown in FIG. 5a, time courses of the calculated arterial 17O2 concentration changes (steps and plateaus) along with a smoothed fit to the data determined by non-linear regression. The fitted function, y=K[ka/(ka\u2212ke)][exp(\u2212ket)\u2212exp(\u2212kat)], is a standard single compartment pharmacokinetic model with exponential washin and washout, where ka and ke are absorption and elimination constants. Best fit parameters are K=0.481 atm, ka=0.0523 sec\u22121, and ke=0.0524 sec\u22121. At an end exhalation pressure of zero, the relevant end-expiratory volume is the functional residual capacity (FRC), which was estimated as 17.3 ml/Kg. FIG. 5a shows the results from the alveolar dilution model, with the 17O2 changes occurring as a series of step increases and decreases during inspiration, followed by plateaus during exhalation. The smoothed fit in FIG. 5a facilitates the visualization of the 17O2 kinetics in the longer time scale of FIG. 5b, where the 17O2 kinetics and normalized ventricular H217O kinetics are superposed. As shown in FIG. 5b, the time course of a smoothed estimate of the arterial 17O2 input function (solid line) is superposed with the measured time course of the decrease in signal in the cerebral ventricle (solid circles), normalized to the signal for the entire brain. The steady state signal in the ventricle is reduced compared to baseline as a consequence of the larger decrease in MR signal for H217O in CSF compared to H217O in tissue. The decrease in scaled signal in the cerebral ventricle is delayed for about 110 seconds after the initial inhalation of 17O2. The delay in the ventricular signal decrease, after the initial 17O2 breaths, of about 110 seconds is readily apparent.",
                                "17O offers some significant advantages for imaging of CMRO2 (and metabolic rate of oxygen utilization in other tissues), mainly owing to the fact that the gaseous 17O2 does not produce an MRI signal but the water produced by metabolism does produce an MRI signal. In past studies, however, interpretation of the MRI signal in terms of regional CMRO2 has been complicated by the entrance, into the region of interest, of water produced by oxygen metabolism in other tissues. The pulsed approach to 17O2 delivery in accordance with the invention takes advantage of kinetic differences in the behavior of 17O2 gas versus H217O water. If it were physically possible to produce a step increase in arterial 17O2 and keep this 17O2 level constant for several minutes, early in the pulse there should be a delay in metabolic H217O production as the gas diffuses from capillary blood to the mitochondria. This diffusive delay is characterized by the time constant \u03b42/D, the average diffusing distance squared divided by the diffusivity of oxygen in tissue. For an average capillary spacing in brain of 50 microns, each capillary can be estimated to supply a cylinder of radius 25 microns. The spatially averaged diffusing distance, assuming uniform distribution of mitochondria around the capillary, is then estimated at 17 microns. For a simple one-dimensional diffusion model into a finite slab, solution to the transient diffusion equation with an oxygen diffusivity in tissue of 2.4\u00d710\u22125 cm2/second estimates that the average 0-90% rise time in mitochondrial concentration after a step change in arterial concentration would be approximately 130 msec. This diffusional delay in mitochondrial 17O2 utilization can therefore be neglected for all but the shortest arterial pulses. After this negligible diffusion time lag, the MRI signal in the ROI should increase as H217O is produced from oxygen metabolism. For a brief interval after this, the regional signal should be determined primarily by the regional CMRO2, and secondarily by the diffusion of H217O out of the ROI. The arterial input for recirculated H217O, however, should have an additional time delay, in part due to diffusion time lag and in part due to a convection time lag.",
                                "First the water produced in mitochondria of other tissues must diffuse to the capillaries and venules. This time lag is again proportional to \u03b42/D, but now with the diffusivity of water in tissue. Estimation of this diffusion lag for water is not as straightforward as the diffusion lag for oxygen, because the appropriate water diffusivity in tissue is not known with any precision. If the relevant diffusivity is the average isotropic diffusivity of water in cortex, reported to be around 0.7\u00d710\u22125 cm2/sec (Neil, J., J. Miller, P. Mukherjee, and P. S. Huppi. Diffusion tensor imaging of normal and injured developing human brain\u2014a technical review. NMR Biomed. 15: 543-52, 2002), the 0-90% response time for a change in capillary concentration after a step change at the mitochondria is estimated as 430 milliseconds, again negligible for all but the briefest pulses. Diffusion of water through lipid bilayers, however, is known to be restricted, and the newly generated H217O may be substantially delayed in traversing first the mitochondrial, then the plasma, and finally the capillary endothelial membranes to reach the venous circulation Inner mitochondrial membrane of hepatocytes has been reported to contain aquaporin 8 (AQP8) channels that should substantially increase the water permeability, but the magnitude of this effect in intact mitochondria, and whether AQP8 is present in mitochondria of other cells, is not currently known. For brain, it has been recently reported by Zhu et al. that the washout of H217O generated metabolically inside the mitochondria is substantially slower than the washout of H217O delivered into tissue by an arterial bolus, suggesting restricted diffusion through the mitochondrial membrane. An additional factor that would delay the appearance of water in the venous circulation is the increased average diffusing distance in most non-cerebral tissues, which generally have a lower metabolic activity and lower capillary density than brain, with the exception of heart and maximally exercising skeletal muscle.",
                                "After this diffusional delay, there is an additional delay for convective transport from the venous drainage of tissue, to the right heart, through the lungs and left heart, and to the arterial circulation in the ROI. For a normal sized adult human, a typical venous to arterial transit time is in the range of 10-18 seconds with a slightly longer time required for transit from systemic capillaries to cerebral arterioles. One would expect a similar convective time lag in a 70 Kg pig. The time delay for the appearance of H217O in the arterial circulation is therefore predicted to be on the order of at least 10-15 seconds, with longer delays if water diffusion in tissue is restricted. More restricted diffusion of water in tissue translates into longer delays in the H217O arterial input function, as well as delayed egress of locally produced H217O in the brain, which in turn would increase the effectiveness of pulsing the 17O2 delivery.",
                                "The definitive data for determining the delay in the H217O arterial input function in this large animal subject would be a direct measurement of H217O in a large artery in the field of view, but this is currently beyond the spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio limits of the inventors' imaging apparatus. The normalized signal for the cerebral ventricle (FIG. 5b), however, does suggest a substantial diffusion delay. The ventricle is a good ROI for detecting small signals in a large noise background for several reasons. First, for equal concentrations of H217O in CSF and in tissue, the MR signal decrease is expected to be different in CSF versus tissue. Therefore after a pulse of 17O2, once a new steady state is achieved with equal H217O concentrations throughout the body, the scaled steady state signal for CSF will be changed compared to baseline even when normalized to the whole brain signal. Normalizing the signal from the ventricle to the signal from the entire brain improves the SNR by negating global artifacts such as such as scanner start-up transients and artifacts from small movements during the sequential images. Second, the ventricle is a relatively large and homogenous structure, with easily recognized borders, and with many voxels for signal averaging.",
                                "H217O can enter the ventricle by three routes\u2014direct secretion by choroid plexus, diffusion from mitochondria adjacent to the ventricle, and diffusion from choroid capillaries once the systemic arterial and capillary concentrations of H217O have increased. Secretion by choroid plexus is a slow process and can be neglected on a time scale of several minutes. Diffusing distances from the H217O produced in adjacent mitochondria, however, are small, as are the diffusion distances between choroid plexus capillaries and CSF. The measured delay in ventricular signal decrease of approximately 110 seconds (FIG. 5), therefore, suggests that water diffusion in tissue is not free but substantially restricted, and also suggests that the arterial input function of H217O is delayed beyond the 10-15 seconds of convective delay.",
                                "Although delivering 17O2 as a brief pulse can simplify the interpretation of the MRI signal, it also presents some substantial challenges. For example, the pulse creates a sharp step change in gas concentration in the ventilator circuit and complicates estimating the time course of arterial 17O2 concentrations, acquiring MRI images with adequate time resolution and SNR, and quantitatively determining CMRO2 from the MRI signal. These issues are addressed below.",

Tubing diameters should be small to minimize transit times and minimize diffusive slurring of concentration fronts. Sudden expansions and contractions in tubing diameter, such as might be found in typical one-way valves, are to be avoided. Flow should be unidirectional with no rebreathing of exhaled gas. The ventilator system presented here is clearly capable of a rapid step change in gas concentration, as shown in FIG. 2. Of note, there are other applications that could benefit from the ability to make a sharp step change in gas concentration, such as FRC determination from inert gas washout.",

The arterial 17O2 kinetics may be estimated with a simple model of this gas dilution that includes the known inspiratory flow pattern from the inhalation pump. This model estimates the time course of arterial 17O2 concentrations as a function of time by determining from nomograms for lung volumes the measured inspiratory flow pattern, and the known inspired 17O2 concentration, using established principles of alveolar gas mixing. In the general case, the approximation can be obtained easily with the evaluation of 2 integrals.

During a brief enough pulse, the arterial input function is identically zero, greatly simplifying the model and its experimental application by deleting a major term. As a first order approximation, venous losses can also be neglected on the grounds that water diffusion from the mitochondria tends to be restricted.

The experiments were also conducted with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of measuring the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in swine with circulatory and respiratory systems similar to humans.",
                                "The methodology involved delivery of only about one tidal volume of 17O2 by a custom, minimal-loss, precision-delivery breathing circuit. A model for gas arterial input function (AIF) is therefore presented for large animals. The AIF of recirculating metabolic water was measured by arterial blood sampling and 17O spectroscopy. The CMRO2 was estimated with rapid T1\u03c1-weighted proton MRI on a 1.5 T clinical scanner as well as with 17O spectroscopy at 3 T.",

Hemispheric CMRO2 is estimated during that time at 1.33\u00b10.26 \u03bcg/g/min, consistent with existing literature values. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that there is ample time before significant recirculation of metabolic H217O to brain and use this information to compute the CMRO2 in swine. The methodology developed herein can be easily adapted to human studies on standard clinical scanners.",

The precision delivery circuit used was developed for gas experiments to provide step changes in concentration of gas at the mouth with precise timing and minimal gas loss. Its design appears schematically in FIG. 1. When used with large animals as in the experiments described here, respiratory rate is set to 6 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 18 times the weight in kg. In these experiments, 1.2 times the tidal volume of enriched 17O2 was diluted with nitrogen to a final concentration of 20% enriched 17O2 and 80% N2 and delivered over 6 breaths. Delivery begins at time 0 in all plots.",
                                "Briefly, the Precision Delivery Circuit connects from outside the magnet room through three sets of tubing to the endotracheal tube of a large animal subject. The pressure line transmits the pressure at the mouthpiece back through 0.125 inch inner diameter tubing to a pressure transducer (Freescale Semiconductor, Chandler Ariz., MPX2010DP). That pressure transducer reports to custom written software in LabView via a multifunction data acquisition device after amplification by a custom operational amplifier circuit. The computer then uses those pressure measurements to adjust inhalation and exhalation pump speeds, overcoming the resistance of 25 feet of 0.25 inch tubing. The inhalation line and exhalation line connect to large peristaltic pumps (Cole Parmer, Chicago Ill., Masterflex PP Digital Drive). The computer also controls valves (VICI Valco Instruments, Houston Tex., Model C45) that select the input gas or output flow for recapture or to vent to room air. Gases are kept at ambient pressure in bags filled before the experiment with low loss circuits to ensure that any error during the experiment will not result in the loss of large volumes of pressurized 17O2 gas.",

It is necessary to know or model the atomic percentage of 17O in the oxygen metabolized by cells because while the mH217O rate of formation is measureable by MRI, the fractional enrichment of the 17O2 generating that water at the cellular level during that time is not known. This is not as much of a problem for small animals that breathe very rapidly and therefore equilibrate their lung gas with the inhaled gas rapidly. A simple step-wise model was generated for estimating the fractional enrichment, fa(i), of 17O in the lungs for each breath. Each step (breath) is modeled as an instantaneous inhalation, mixing of 17O2 in the lungs, and exhalation via a simple dilution model with the addition of O2 uptake into the body from the lungs.

The first part of the equation represents locally produced mH217O while the second part represents outflow and inflow of mH217O. In the short time course of 17O2 measurement where there is not significant recirculation of mH217O, Ca(t)\u2212Cv(t) approximates 0 during the measurement time.

Four control samples were taken before the experiment began. The tubes used are designed to reseal immediately after needle puncture. Their ability to remain sealed was tested by taking several tubes at random, creating a strong negative pressure inside the tube with a vacuum pump attached to a needle, and then repeated puncture with larger diameter needles than used for blood sampling. The pressure inside the tubes was checked after over a dozen punctures and had changed less than 10%. Storage over a period of a week of a sampling of tubes showed no depressurization over time.",
                                "A concern is that water 17O will exchange with ambient CO2 through bicarbonate ion, a very fast reaction when catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase as in whole blood (Mills G A, Urey H C. The Kinetics of Isotopic Exchange between Carbon Dioxide, Bicarbonate Ion, Carbonate Ion and Water. J Am Chem Soc 1940; 62 (5):1019-1026). To minimize this effect, serum was separated by centrifugation soon after the experiment. Tubes were then frozen at \u221220 C and kept sealed until the time of analysis. Centrifugation places a gel between the serum and red blood cells in these tubes to fully separate the two. This procedure serves to protect the samples in two ways. First, because the tube is sealed, blood can mix only with the small amount of CO2 (\u02dc450 parts per million) in the small amount of air (<1 mL) drawn into the tube, a trivial source of mixing. A small amount of mixing can occur with the blood bicarbonate, but this reaction is extremely fast and occurs in the body regardless. As blood bicarbonate is <30 mM (Recchia F A, Vogel T R, Hintze T H. NO metabolites accumulate in erythrocytes in proportion to carbon dioxide and bicarbonate concentration. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 2000; 279(2):H852-856), this represents a trivial loss of 17O. Second, carbonic anhydrase has almost no activity in serum (Meldrum N U, Roughton F J. Carbonic anhydrase. Its preparation and properties. J Physiol 1933; 80(2):113-142). So when the serum is re-exposed to air, the reaction catalyst is missing, and the NMR measurement completed within 10 minutes suggests that the loss of 17O is less than 5% during that time (Bitterman N, Lin L, Forster R E. A micromethod for measuring carbonic anhydrase activity using 18O exchange between CO2 and H2O. J Appl Physiol 1988; 65(4):1902-1906).",

The slope of the signal change in half of the brain in one central slice of brain gives the hemispheric mH217O production and that is calculated for each hemisphere in Table 2 (below) and converted to CMRO2 measurements. The f values correspond to the fractional enrichment of 17O delivered where 0.41 corresponds to delivery of 70% 17O2 and 0.24 corresponds to delivery of 40% 17O2. Taken together, these demonstrate that CMRO2 can be calculated by the signal change of 1 minute of inhalation by the indirect technique at 1.5 Tesla.",
                                "Discussion. The CMRO2 of pigs of comparable size using a similar continuous infusion ketamine and benzodiazepine anesthesia regimen has been estimated to be 1.63\u00b10.19 \u03bcmol/g/min by 15O PET (Poulsen P H, Smith D F, Ostergaard L, Danielsen E H, Gee A, Hansen S B, Astrup J, Gjedde A. In vivo estimation of cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose metabolism in the pig by [15O] water injection, [15O] oxygen inhalation and dual injections of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose. J Neurosci Methods 1997; 77(2): 199-209). The spatial resolution of those measurements presented here is the same as those 15O PET images without the need for an onsite cyclotron or radioactivity. Still, differences in pig CMRO2 found in the literature vary significantly depending on the technique, anesthesia regimen, and size of pig used. One study averages 1.20\u00b10.29 \u03bcmol/g/min and 1.15\u00b10.46 \u03bcmol/g/min by radioactive and fluorescent microspheres respectively (Ehrlich M P, McCullough J N, Zhang N, Weisz D J, Juvonen T, Bodian C A, Griepp R B. Effect of hypothermia on cerebral blood flow and metabolism in the pig. Ann Thorac Surg 2002; 73(0:191-197). Another radioactive microsphere study in pigs of different ages found CMRO2 ranging from 1.30 to 1.75 \u03bcmol/g/min (Ichord R N, Kirsch J R, Helfaer M A, Haun S, Traystman R J. Age-related differences in recovery of blood flow and metabolism after cerebral ischemia in swine. Stroke 1991; 22(5):626-634). The measurements made here compare favorably to these values.",
                                "While 3 Tesla scanners are relatively widespread clinically, lower fields have some advantages in the indirect imaging application. The J-coupling interaction that leads to relaxation enhancement is a field strength independent interaction. As such, higher starting T2 values for tissue make the absolute T2 reduction by H217O greater at lower field strengths. Also, lower tissue T1 values allow for faster averaging of the spin-spin coupling based H217O effect. Further, diminished magnetic susceptibility effects reduce the competing signal changes from cerebral blood and sequence artifacts. This is in contrast to 17O which benefits from ultra-high fields and is typically performed at clinically unavailable field strengths. For all these reasons 1.5 T was chosen for the present studies.",
                                "Nevertheless, the major technical limitation of 1H detected 17O imaging is the relatively small effect of physiologic levels of 17O on 1H relaxation. This problem can be overcome in human applications for several reasons. First, the CMRO2 measured here is on the order of 3-fold less than the CMRO2 of resting humans, mostly due to anesthesia. Therefore human studies should correspond to a roughly 3\u00d7 improvement of the 17O effect. Second, the human brain is so much larger than pig brain that region of interest analyses should be more easily obtainable and more meaningful. Third, as humans are far more cooperative than pigs and do not require anesthesia, human studies should be easier to perform. Further, as units of 17O will cost less as more is produced, it is hoped that the cost of these techniques will be improved by increased interest and usage by the research community.",
                                "It must be noted that the equations used to quantify CMRO2 have sources of potential error for absolute measurements. The value of the relaxation enhancement due to 17O on 1H, R2, for example is difficult to measure in vivo or with ex vivo tissues, and as such it may be imprecise. As well, R2 may vary based on different tissue parameters such as grey or white matter or cerebral blood volume per voxel. For example, the sequence given in this paper measures R1\u03c1(100 Hz) as 1.37*10\u22125 mM\u22121 ms\u22121 in H217O doped phosphate buffered saline phantoms, and that would likely approximate the value for blood or cerebrospinal fluid. It is also known that R2 has a dependence on pH (Meiboom S. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Proton Transfer in Water. Journal of Chemical Physics 1961; 34(2):375-&). This is a very minor concern for application in cerebral infarction, as one rat model shows overall tissue pH in hyperacute stroke leading to complete infarction to drop to a minimum of 6.6 (Nedergaard M, Kraig R P, Tanabe J, Pulsinelli W A. Dynamics of interstitial and intracellular pH in evolving brain infarct. Am J Physiol 1991; 260(3 Pt 2):R581-588) and R2 shown by Meiboom only varies about 10% over the pH interval 6.2-7.8. Also, since R2 is reduced by pH extremes, further drops in pH would underestimate mH217O production and serve to magnify the probability that a tissue is infracted in future applications of this technology. The value off, the tissue fractional enrichment of 17O, chosen is based from a very simple, approximate model of inhalation appropriate for averaging over several breaths; however more sophisticated modeling could potentially be used. This factor has not been considered in the estimation of CMRO2 with 17O2 previously because small animals have high respiratory rates and the slurring of the 17O fractional enrichment may be neglected because gas mixing in the lungs occurs much more quickly. Also, it becomes more reasonable to neglect f with longer time periods of inhalation where the fractional enrichment has had sufficient time for equilibration with the enriched 17O gas. Despite these considerations, relative CMRO2 in the same subject or across subjects can be estimated using the current techniques.",
                                "The T1\u03c1-prepared, centrically encoded, fully balanced spin echo sequence used in this study evolved from decoupling experiments in which high T1\u03c1 spin lock amplitudes (Rizi R R, Charagundla S R, Song H K, Reddy R, Stolpen A H, Schnall M D, Leigh J S. Proton T1rho-dispersion imaging of rodent brain at 1.9 T. J Magn Reson Imaging 1998; 8(5):1090-1096), off resonance spin-locking (Charagundla S R, Stolpen A H, Leigh J S, Reddy R.

Magn Reson Imaging 1996; 14(9):1073-1078) are used to mitigate the 1H\u201417O J-coupling interaction. This sequence improves the temporal resolution for these decoupling techniques significantly by allowing them to be performed with a fast single shot imaging readout. This brings down the temporal resolution from at least 10 seconds per image with turbo spin echo based readouts to about 3.5 seconds with the current sequence and parameters. The small spin lock amplitude, 100 Hz, used here gives extremely similar R1\u03c1 constants to measured R2 in the case of 17O (Stolpen A H, Reddy R, Leigh J S. 17O-decoupled proton MR spectroscopy and imaging in a tissue model.

J Magn Reson B 1995; 108(3):276-279) without visible artifact or effect of macroscopic background field gradients. This study was performed with a body coil transmitter and surface receiver, which is suggested for the high homogeneity of the body coil for spin-locking Decoupling of the 1H\u201417O interaction can be performed with high spin lock amplitudes as well. While decoupling is not performed in this study due to implementation difficulties and specific absorption rate concerns on clinical scanners, decoupling experiments similar to those previously conducted (Reddy R, Stolpen A H, Leigh J S. Detection of 17O by proton T1 rho dispersion imaging. J Magn Reson B 1995; 108(3):276-279; Reddy R, Stolpen A H, Charagundla S R, Insko E K, Leigh J S. 17O-decoupled 1H detection using a double-tuned coil. Magn Reson Imaging 1996; 14(9):1073-1078) can be performed using the sequence and delivery techniques presented here. Also, it may be possible that the same estimates could be made with a fast T2 weighted sequences such as spin echo echo planar imaging or single shot turbo spin echo methods. In particular, spin echo echo planar imaging presents the possibility of obtaining 3D metabolic images. However, caution must be exercised using sequences, as any possible distortion or artifact may mask the small proton signal change generated by physiologic short-term mH217O production. T1\u03c1 imaging, as shown here, enables us to measure the small changes due to mH217O that may not be seen with other sequences due to artifacts that may obscure small signal changes in long T2-weighted images or in echo planar imaging.",
                                "While it is recognized that the anesthesia regimen may change the vascular recirculation of mH217O as opposed to awake humans, multiple 15O PET studies have modeled the time course of recirculation for metabolic water using similar time courses with a single breath hold in humans and these have also made CMRO2 measurements claiming recirculation during the first minute to be negligible (Meyer E, Tyler J L, Thompson C J, Redies C, Diksic M, Hakim A M. Estimation of cerebral oxygen utilization rate by single-bolus 15O2 inhalation and dynamic positron emission tomography. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 1987; 7(4):403-414; Ohta S, Meyer E, Thompson C J, Gjedde A. Oxygen consumption of the living human brain measured after a single inhalation of positron emitting oxygen. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 1992; 12(2):179-192). Indeed, the measurements made here and the modeling used for CMRO2 measurement is very similar to 15O experiments performed in humans (Mintun M A, Raichle M E, Martin W R, Herscovitch P. Brain oxygen utilization measured with O-15 radiotracers and positron emission tomography. J Nucl Med 1984; 25(2):177-187). In that study, 40 seconds were used to measure CMRO2 after a 20 second delay after start of inhalation. Recirculation of H215O was measured and found to be minimal during that time. The error in CMRO2 calculation ignoring wash-in was simulated to be less than 15% for very critically low values of oxygen extraction fraction (<0.15), and less than 5% for typical oxygen extraction fractions (>0.3). With the current data and the PET data taken together, it seems the recirculation delay is comparable in humans, and as such, anesthesia in pigs is not thought to be a significant factor for the kinetics of mH217O recirculation. If anything, these experiments should become easier to perform in humans who have larger brains, higher resting brain metabolic rates, and do not require anesthesia for imaging.",
                                "Another difference between the current study and many short time course PET studies is that for delivery PET studies frequently use a single tidal volume inhalation of tracer with a breath hold. We do not employ this strategy here for several reasons. First, any fluctuation in blood oxygen content results in a change in MRI signal (Butte D, Chiarelli P, Wise R, Jezzard P. Measurement of cerebral blood volume in humans using hyperoxic MRI contrast. J Magn Reson Imaging 2007; 26(4):894-899; Chiarelli P A, Butte D P, Wise R, Gallichan D, Jezzard P. A calibration method for quantitative BOLD fMRI based on hyperoxia. Neuroimage 2007; 37(3):808-820). A single bolus of 100% oxygen after breathing room air will cause an increase in MR signal that will interfere with the measurement (suggested by above references and demonstrated by EAM, data not shown). It is possible to have the subject breathe 100% oxygen for a period of time to stabilize the MR signal before 17O2 delivery and this has been done by us with similar mH217O observations. However, modeling indicates that this wastes much more expensive 17O2 gas by exhalation of oxygen unused by the lungs than the method presented here. This is because hemoglobin is fully saturated past \u02dc15% O2 at latm pressure and as such most of the oxygen in a 100% oxygen inhalation will not be absorbed. A large single breath of 17O2 could potentially be held longer to decrease the amount of exhaled 17O, however this risks even small amounts of hemoglobin desaturation which will artificially enhance the 17O effect by T2*/T2/T1\u03c1 reduction by paramagnetic venous deoxyhemoglobin. Still, with careful bolusing and hemoglobin saturation accounting, a single breath MRI method could be obtained that would use approximately the same amount of 17O2 used here.",
                                "The present study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring CMRO2 in large animals on clinical scanners using a single tidal volume of 17O2 gas delivered with a precision delivery circuit. By minimizing gas required for CMRO2 measurements, employing a large animal model, and utilizing clinical hardware, this represents a crucial first step towards the translation of small animal 17O2 studies to humans. A simple model of lung mixing and delivery to tissues is presented. Arterial blood sampling and analysis of mH217O content shows the time when recirculation begins to be 60-80 seconds\u2014ample time for fast imaging techniques to obtain numerous images for CMRO2 estimation. High temporal resolution indirect and direct imaging is correlated to show similar results for the estimation of CMRO2 non-invasively during those 60 seconds. For indirect imaging only a clinical 1.5T scanner with standard hardware and an easily programmable pulse sequence is necessary."

To bring techniques based on 17O closer to clinical application, demonstrated herein is imaging of metabolically generated H217O in pigs after 17O2 delivery with increased temporal resolution Tip-weighted imaging and precision delivery of 17O2 gas. The kinetics of the appearance of H217O in pig brains are displayed with one to two minutes of 17O2 delivery, the shortest delivery times reported in the literature. It is also shown that H217O concentrations can be quantified with single shot T1\u03c1 imaging based on a balanced steady state free precession readout, and that with this strategy pausing to reduce T1 saturation increases sensitivity to H217O over acquisition in the steady state. Several additional considerations with this sequence, which can be generalized to any pre-encoding cluster, such as energy deposition are considered.",

Pigs are used as a model for their similar lung capacities and circulations to humans. While the detection of H217O with a steady state sequence has been reported, the present study shows theoretically H217O sensitivity is improved by a sequence with a T1\u03c1 or T2 pre-encoding cluster followed by signal acquisition without the steady state directly after pre-encoding. The efficacy is demonstrated by phantom experiments and in vivo.",

The T1\u03c1 pre-encoded bSSFP pulse sequence consists of a T1\u03c1 preparatory cluster followed by a centrically-encoded 2D bSSFP readout without dummy scans (shown in FIG. 7).",

The ability of the sequence to detect changes in H217O concentration was measured by imaging six 15 mL conical tubes filled with 1\u00d7 Phosphate Buffered Saline doped with H217O (Isotec, Miamisberg, Ohio) in steps of 5 mM from 20 mM (natural abundance) to 45 mM. These tubes were sealed and placed into a 9 cm jar filled with water. A receive only loop coil was placed around the jar and used in combination with the body transmit coil. Cross-sectional images of the tubes were acquired with a spin lock amplitude of 100 Hz and spin lock times of 200,400,600,800, and 1000 msec. Imaging parameters are: FoV 90 mm2, ST 5 mm, TR/TE 10.4/5.2 ms, Matrix 1282, BW 130 Hz/Px, \u03b1=180\u00b0.",

A live pig was placed supine inside a 1.5T Siemens Sonata clinical scanner on a vendor supplied surface coil. Once placed inside, the intubation tube was connected to a custom precision delivery breathing circuit that drove the pig's breathing at 6 breaths/min at a tidal volume of 18 mL times the weight in kg. A standard T1-weighted localizer sequence was run to find a suitable coronal image of the middle portion of the pig brain that included cortex, brainstem, and ventricle. A T1-weighted IR-prepared GRE sequence (MP-RAGE) was performed to obtain anatomical images of the pig brain and the desired slice.

FIG. 12 provides cross-sectional images of 15 mL conical tubes filled with phosphate buffered saline and doped with increasing amounts of H217O to concentrations from 20 mM (natural abundance) to 45 mM (25 mM added).

The image (b) shows the contrast developed with 100 Hz spin locking The relaxivity of these phantoms taken from a series of T1\u03c1-weighted images (not shown) was applied to equation 1 along with the signal intensities from the above images to calculate 17O concentrations (FIG. 13).",

In essence, by filling the center of k-space first with a high flip angle, contrast is much higher than when obtaining T2 contrast in the steady state. The simulated differences are summarized in Table 3, below. Despite the possibility of generating images faster, steady state acquisition offers less SNR and CNR efficiency.",
                                "Because SAR is a concern in fast imaging sequences, shown in Table 4, below, is how contrast and SAR reduce with decreases in Flip Angle. CNR Efficiency vs. Steady State compares the CNR from a non-steady state acquisition with the given flip angle against CNR from a steady state acquisition with optimum flip angle (\u02dc60\u00b0) for CNR in the steady state.",

Signal decreases demonstrate the detection of 17O2 conversion to H217O. To demonstrate pulsed delivery of 17O2 gas, 1 breath of 40% was delivered to three pigs either as one breath or diluted with nitrogen to simulate room air. A consistent signal drop is observed after each delivery. Because only one breath of gas is used to show change, this represents the smallest volume delivery of gas published.",

These were performed with TSL=200 ms to develop a higher percent signal change, but with SNR about 40:1 as opposed to 150:1 at TSL=75 ms. Results are shown in FIG. 14. The whole brain signal trace is an average of these three experiments, though ROIs from different regions show similar kinetics. Two pigs were imaged with a protocol of 5 minutes of 100% O2, 2 breaths of 40% 17O enriched O2, then 5 minutes of 100% O2. The third pig was imaged with 5 minute room air then 2 breaths of 20% O2 (40% enriched 17O2) mixed with 80% N2. The start of 17O2 is indicated by the arrow. Because the normalized signal trace from the third experiment is so similar, it has been pooled. Signal changes are statistically significant when compared to baseline (data not shown).",
