    "title": "Development of a Mucus Gland Bioreactor in Loach Paramisgurnus dabryanus",
    "date": "2021-01-12",
    "abstract": "Most currently available bioreactors have some defects in the expression, activity, or purification of target protein and peptide molecules, whereas the mucus gland of fish can overcome these defects to become a novel bioreactor for the biopharmaceutical industry. In this study, we have evaluated the practicability of developing a mucus gland bioreactor in loach (Paramisgurnus dabryanus). A transgenic construct pT2-krt8-IFN1 was obtained by subcloning the promoter of zebrafish keratin 8 gene and the type I interferon (IFN1) cDNA of grass carp into the SB transposon. The IFN1 expressed in CIK cells exhibited an antiviral activity against the replication of GCRV873 and activated two genes downstream of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. A transgenic loach line was then generated by microinjection of the pT2-krt8-IFN1 plasmids and in vitro synthesized capped SB11 mRNA. Southern blots indicated that a single copy of IFN1 gene was stably integrated into the genome of transgenic loach. The expression of grass carp IFN1 in transgenic loaches was detected with RT-PCR and Western blots. About 0.0825 \u00b5g of grass carp IFN1 was detected in 20 \u00b5L mucus from transgenic loaches. At a viral titer of 1 \u00d7 103 PFU/mL, plaque numbers on plates containing mucus from transgenic loaches reduced by 18% in comparison with those of the control, indicating that mucus of IFN1-transgenic loaches exhibited an antiviral activity. Thus, we have successfully created a mucus gland bioreactor that has great potential for the production of various proteins and peptides.",

                "Protein and peptide drugs are playing important roles in protection of human and animals from various diseases and their market demands are quickly increased year by year (http://www.bccresearch.com). The transgenic bioreactor can be developed by the introduction of a protein-encoding gene under the control of a promoter into the genome of microorganisms, plants or animals to effectively produce target proteins and peptide molecules with biological activities of economic values.",
                "Currently available bioreactors, such as bacteria [1], yeasts [2], transgenic plants [3], and transgenic animals [4], have produced a number of drugs that are widely used for medical and experimental purposes, but these bioreactors have to overcome some defects such as a lack of post-translational modification for biological activities of target proteins and peptides, high costs for the generation of bioreactors and purification of target proteins and peptides, or products that are toxic to bioreactors [5,6].",
                "Fish is considered as the most suitable market-oriented transgenic animal for human consumption [7]. With the successful development of the first transgenic fish [8], more than 35 species of fish have been used for gene transfer studies to improve growth rate, disease resistance and antifreeze and to dissect gene functions. Fish exhibit some advantages over other organisms for development of bioreactors, such as short breeding cycle, easy to raise on a large scale, low cost of feeding, and high production of eggs. Moreover, no co-infection by virus and bacteria were found in human and fish [9]. However, fish as bioreactors remain to be extensively studied. Fish eggs were first tested as potential bioreactors to express foreign recombinant proteins [10]. Human pharmaceutical proteins can be produced from fertilized eggs since human seventh coagulation factor can be widely expressed in tilapia embryos [11]. Recombinant goldfish luteinizing hormone can be successfully expressed and glycosylated in transgenic rainbow trout embryos [12]. Under the control of oocyte-specific gene zp3 promoter, mature tilapia insulin-like growth factor was successfully expressed in zebrafish [9].",
                "Many fish species, such as loach (Paramisgurnus dabryanus), yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco), and southern catfish (Silurus meridoualis), are able to release a large amount of mucus especially under stress conditions. Fish mucous cells are the most common cell types in the epidermis except for microfilament cells. Mucous cells have more endoplasmic reticulum structures and have mucus-secreting properties [13]. Fish mucus is known to function in breathing, ion and osmotic pressure regulation, reproduction, excretion, disease resistance, communication, feeding, and nesting [14,15,16]. Fish mucus is mainly composed of glycoproteins and contains other biologically active substances such as mucopolysaccharide [17], lysozyme [18], immunoglobulin [19], complement, carbonic anhydrase [20], lectin [21], secreted toxin [22], calmodulin [23], c-reactive protein [19], pheromones [24], and proteolytic enzymes [25]. Moreover, biologically active substances expressed in mucous cells are usually packaged in mucous bubbles and only when mucous cells migrate to the body surface can mucous substances be released [26], which would cause less harmful effects of foreign molecules on the donor body. Therefore, mucous cells in fish skin have the potential to produce biologically active molecules through collection of mucus.",
                "To generate mucus gland bioreactors, the first step is to obtain a mucus cell-specific promoter to specifically control the expression of DNA sequences encoding a protein or peptide of interest and allow the secretion of the products into mucus. Keratin is a major class of intermediate filament proteins that are mainly expressed in the epidermis of higher eukaryotes. Three keratin genes have been identified to express in the epidermis of the skin [27,28], in which the krt8 gene has been used as a zebrafish ideal epidermal marker during development. The promoter of the krt8 gene (2.2 k) was used to specifically drive the expression of GFP reporter gene in the epidermis of the skin, both in zebrafish and barley [29,30]. Thus, the krt8 gene promoter appears to be useful for generation of a mucus bioreactor.",
                "The second step is to select a suitable DNA sequence encoding an important protein or peptide, whose biological activities can be easily detected either in cultured cells or animals. Grass carp hemorrhagic disease is a disease induced by grass carp reovirus (GCRV). The disease caused by GCRV leads to a mortality rate of more than 80% for young grass carp [31] and a severe loss to aquaculture every year in Asia. GCRV is a double-stranded RNA virus composed of 11 RNA subunits [32]. GCRV873 belongs to the type I GCRV and its genome sequencing has been completed [33]. GCRV873 can cause pathological changes of kidney tissue cell lines of grass carp (CIK) [34], suggesting CIK cells are suitable for in vitro assays of GCRV873 infection. The virus begins to replicate after CIK cells are infected with 12 h at 28 \u00b0C, and the virus begins to multiply in large numbers after 24\u201372 h. In addition, GCRV can infect rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) and black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), leading to damaged tissues with phenotypes similar to those of grass carp hemorrhagic disease [35,36].",
                "Interferons (IFNs) are a class of cytokines with antiviral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory activities. These properties of IFNs are mainly used for treatment of virus diseases in human and animals. Type I interferon (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) can be produced in large quantities by most cell types in response to viral or other microbial infections and plays an important role in immune response against multiple viruses [37]. Type I interferon can activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway after binding to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, followed by induction of downstream gene expression and exertion of their biological functions [38]. Thus, GCRV873 and IFNs system can be used to test the development of novel bioreactors.",
                "In this study, we successfully generated a transgenic loach line expressing the type I grass carp IFN (gcIFN1) in the mucus. We tested the antiviral capability of gcIFN1 from cultured cells and mucus of transgenic loach. Our data indicate that fish mucus cells have a great potential for the generation of novel bioreactors."

To detect the activity of the krt8 promoter, the IFN1 in pT2-krt8-IFN1 was replaced with EGFP to generate a testing vector pT2-krt8-EGFP. After microinjection of pT2-krt8-EGFP into fertilized eggs of loach, a large amount of green fluorescence signals were observed on the skin of larvae at 1\u20135 dpf (day post-fertilization) (Figure 1B). These data indicate that the krt8 promoter can specifically drive the expression of EGFP in the skin of transgenic loaches.",

Western blotting showed that IFN1 can be secreted to the medium of cultured 293T cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). Moreover, transfection of 293T cells with the transgenic vector pT2-krt8-IFN1, a small amount of IFN1 can be detected in the culture medium (Figure 1C), indicating that IFN1 expressed under the control of krt8 promoter can be secreted outside the cells."

When the dilution factor of GCRV873 reached to 106 times, CIK cells showed an obviously pathological phenomenon of forming plaques. Thus, the appearance of plaques can be a marker for detecting the antiviral activity of proteins expressed in vitro.",
                        "To determine the antiviral activity of IFN1 expressed in 293T cells, antivirus tests were carried out using CIK cells and GCRV873 virus particles. When the density of CIK cells reached to about 80% confluence, culture medium containing different concentrations of GCRV873 virus particles was added. As shown in Figure 2A, CIK cells that were subjected to infection with GCRV873 virus particles (Viral titer = 5.0 \u00d7 104 PFU/mL or 5.0 \u00d7 105 PFU/mL) underwent severe apoptosis, indicating that RNA virus particles of GCRV873 could actively infect CIK cells and caused apoptosis.",
                        "Next, pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-IFN1-His plasmids were electrically transfected into CIK cells at about 80% confluence. A final concentration (Viral titer = 1 \u00d7 102 PFU/mL) of GCRV873 in M199 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum was used for different experimental groups after transfection for 12 h. We found that cells expressing IFN1 formed less number of plaques than the control cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (Figure 2B), suggesting an antiviral activity of grass carp IFN1 from CIK cells.",
                        "To further detect the antiviral activity of grass carp IFN1 from CIK cells, total RNAs of cultured CIK cells at different time points of transfection (Supplementary Figure S2B) were extracted to detect the transcription of S5 and S6 subunits of GCRV873 as well as STAT1 and IFR-9 that are regulated by IFN1 signaling. In comparison with those in control cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids, mRNA levels of S5 and S6 subunits were significantly down-regulated in cells transfected with pcDNA-IFN1-His plasmids for 24 and/or 36 h. However, mRNA levels of STAT1 and IFR-9 in cells transfected with pcDNA-IFN1-His plasmids were significantly induced from 12 to 24 h and decreased at 36 h (Figure 2C). These data indicate that cell-expressed grass carp IFN1 can inhibit the replication of the GCRV873 and activate the IFN signaling pathway."

As shown in Figure 4A, 4 out of 12 F1 individuals were positive transgenic loaches showing DNA bands with the same size as that of the positive control (PC) and confirmed by DNA sequencing.",
                        "Next, we detected the existence of grass carp IFN1 in mucus of positive loaches. In comparison with the scraping approach, collection of the mucus through over-extrusion gave less cell debris (Supplementary Figure S4A). After centrifugation and filtration, mucus samples from positive and wild type loaches were subjected to western blotting with His-tag antibody. Two clear protein bands appeared in the mucus of positive loaches but not in wild type loaches. However, the molecule weight of IFN1 in the mucus was higher than that of IFN1 from cultured 293T cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, purified grass carp IFN1 from 293T cells (Supplementary Figure S4B) was found to be modified by N-glycosylation (Figure S4C), but IFN1 from mucus could not be deglycosylated with PNGase F or O-glycosidase (data not shown). These date suggest that integrated IFN1-cDNA can be translationally expressed and expressed grass carp IFN1 in mucus of transgenic loaches appear to be not modified by N- and O-glycosylation.",

IFN1 expressed in cultured 293T cells was purified and dyed with coomassie bright blue on SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure S4B). The purified IFN1 can be used as a reference protein to detect the content of IFN1 in mucus. Different amounts of purified IFN1 and 20 \u00b5L mucus of transgenic loaches were examined with western blotting (Figure 4C) and approximately 0.0825 \u00b5g of IFN1 in 20 \u00b5L mucus of transgenic loaches was determined by analysis with the Image J software (Figure 4D).

Then, a proper viral titer of GCRV873 which was 1.0 \u00d7 102 PFU/mL or 1.0 \u00d7 103 PFU/mL was added in medium. The mucus from wide-type loaches was used as the control.

Similarly, at a viral titer of 1 \u00d7 103 PFU/mL, plaque numbers on plates containing mucus from transgenic loaches reduced by 18% in comparison with those of the control (Figure 5C).

In this study, we have successfully generated a transgenic loach line in which a single copy of grass carp IFN1-expressing cassette has stably integrated into the loach genome. Purified IFN1 from cultured 293T cells remained a strong antiviral ability. Moreover, the proper expression of IFN1 in mucus of transgenic loaches was detected by Western blotting. Hence, mucus glands of transgenic fish including loach exhibited the potential to become a novel bioreactor for the production of protein/peptides with medical and industrial values.",
                "The development of highly effective bioreactors has always been a hot research topic due to an increasing market demand for protein/peptide drugs [40]. As of May 2017, 74 antibody-based molecules have been approved by a regulatory authority in a major market [41]. In addition to advantages, bioreactors currently available have demonstrated various disadvantages. Bacteria bioreactors have a poor capacity to synthesize some proteins and particularly those containing a complex structure [42]. Yeast bioreactors can synthesize and secrete a human glycoprotein with uniform complex N-glycosylation, which could be used for elucidating the structure-function relation of glycoproteins [43]. However, recombinant hepatitis B vaccine prepared from yeast does not contain the disulphide bridges that must be synthesized [44]. Transgenic plants producing antibodies may raise environmental concerns, whereas such problems are unlikely to be encountered with transgenic animals that are kept in enclosed areas [45]. Animal mammary gland bioreactor such as saliva [46] and other transgenic product such as blood [47] have proved to be a production platform for foreign proteins. Recombinant protein produced by transgenic animals is a cumbersome process and remains problematic in the application of this technology due to high cost and low expression efficiency [48]. Our data in this study indicate that the bioreactor of fish mucous gland exhibited the potential to overcome some of these defects, such as secreting a large amount of mucus under stimulation without harmful effects on itself and relatively low cost for the isolation of recombinant proteins/peptides from mucus.",
                "In the prevention and treatment of grass carp haemorrhagic disease, intraperitoneal injection and drug immersion are two main therapeutic approaches. Induced interferon from crucian carp at 10,000 U/mL shown antiviral activity: the dose of intraperitoneal injection was 0.3 mL/trail and the concentration of drug immersion was 50 U/mL [49]. The mucus from positive loaches has showed a modest antiviral ability due to the low content of expressed INF1, so further efforts are needed to improve the secretion of proteins/peptides by fish mucous glands.",
                "The krt8 promoter used in this study can drive the expression of genes in the skin of both zebrafish and medaka [29,30]. A controlled and localized expression of genes in fibroblasts can be improved under the control of collagen-specific promoter [50]. Thus, the promoter used in this study could be replaced with a mucus gland-specific promoter to increase the specific expression and secretion of target proteins/peptides.",
                "Difference in integration sites could affect the expression level of foreign genes within a target genome. Transposon systems such as the Sleeping Beauty transposon [51] and the Tol2 transposon system [52] can significantly improve the integration efficiency of foreign genes. Transgenic bioreactors containing limited copies of foreign genes that have integrated into non-coding regions of the target genome could increase the expression of target proteins and reduce side-effects on the development and growth of transgenic animals. In addition, many fish species such as Yellow River catfish have more mucous cells and a stronger ability to secrete mucus [34] could be used for development of mucus gland bioreactors.",
                "Mucus contains a large number of lectins and other substances [26]. During the process of secretion, target proteins may covalently bind to other substances, thus affecting the activity of the protein. In this study, we found that N-glycosylation occurred in grass carp IFN1 secreted by in vitro cultured 293T cells, but not in grass carp IFN1 from mucus of transgenic loaches. It is likely that complicated modifications have occurred in grass carp IFN1 from mucus of transgenic loaches as evidenced by its increased molecular weight. Further investigations are required to purify a large amount of IFN1 from mucus of transgenic loaches and then determine the structure and modification forms. Identification of modification types and the residue within target proteins could improve the efficiency of loach mucus bioreactors. Moreover, molecular mechanisms of mucus secretion remain largely unclear. We have previously identified signal pathways related to mucus secretion through RNA-seq analysis of loach skin transcripts [53]. To further investigate the intracellular mechanisms of mucus secretion and testing approaches such as low-voltage electricity and low-concentration salt to safely stimulate the secretion of IFN1 by mucus cells of transgenic fish will contribute to the development of mucous gland bioreactors in fish.",
                "Taken together, we successfully produced transgenic loach that have the capability to stably express and secrete IFN1 in the mucus. IFN1 from transgenic loach remained the antiviral activity against GCRV replication and activated downstream genes of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Fish mucus glands exhibited a great potential for production of proteins/peptides."

STAT1 and IRF-9 are two key genes downstream of JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which can be activated by IFN1 binding to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 [38]. The number of plaques formed in different cell dishes were detected with crystal violet staining to determine the antiviral ability of IFN1.
