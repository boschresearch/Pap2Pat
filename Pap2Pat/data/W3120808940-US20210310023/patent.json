                        "Furthermore, the step S1 obtaining specific expression promoters of fish skin and mucous gland cell comprises: using transcriptomics, comparing and analyzing gene expression profiles of different tissues or cells of fish, identifying genes specifically expressed in fish skin and mucus gland cells, and searching for specific expression promoters of genes; or using proteomics techniques, comparing and analyzing protein expression profiles of different tissues or cells, identifying genes specifically expressed in fish skin and mucous gland cells, and searching for promoters of specifically expressed genes; or searching published literature to find genes or promoters specifically expressed in fish skin and mucous gland cells.",
                        "Furthermore, searching for the promoter of a specifically expressed gene is to use a genomic sequence alignment method or a chromosome walking technique, combined with biological information analysis to find the promoter sequence upstream of the target gene.",

                        "Compared with fish eggs or testes, if fish skin mucous glands can be used as bioreactors, they have more prominent advantages. Fish skin mucus cells are widely distributed on the body surface, their secretion ability is strong, and they are not affected by age, season and gender restrictions. The secreted proteins are packed into the mucus vesicles, and the mucus can be released only when the mucus cells migrate to the surface of the body, and the expressed foreign protein will not adversely affect the cells and the body itself. The mucous glands of fish skin can release a large amount of mucus in a short period of time in the case of shock or environmental factors. Therefore, by stimulating the fish body, the mucus discharge time can be artificially controlled to facilitate the centralized collection of mucus and the extraction of bioactive substances in the mucus.",
                        "The invention proposes for the first time the concept of skin mucus glands of fish (such as loach, catfishes, etc.) as a bioreactor, and establishes a set of technical system for producing grass carp type I interferon (IFN1) by using transgenic loach skin mucus glands. The present invention is suitable for the production of any biologically active peptides, proteins, enzymes, vaccines, antibodies, etc.",
                        "The invention utilizes the obtained potential fish skin and mucinous gland cell specific promoter DNA sequences, clones them into a promoter activity test vector, microinjects them into single-cell fish fertilized eggs, and observes the promoter-driven fluorescence (such as EGFP, RFP, etc.) during embryonic development and tissue-specific expression of protein genes, thereby identifying skin and mucous gland cell-specific promoters.",
                        "The biologically active substance produced by the present invention should have the ability to secrete into the mucus. The biologically active substance needs to be possessed by itself or a suitable signal peptide must be added by molecular cloning. Firstly, use the SignalP 4.1 Server website to predict whether a biologically active substance has a signal peptide. If it does not have a signal peptide, you can use molecular cloning to add a suitable signal peptide to the N-terminus of the target gene to ensure the normal secretion of the biologically active substance. Secondly, the expression plasmid carrying the target gene is transfected into the cells, and the supernatant of the culture medium is collected, and the expression of the target protein is detected by Western blot, so as to detect the effect and efficiency of the biologically active substance signal peptide.",
                        "The present invention linearizes the transgene expression vector, and co-microinjects it with mature SB transposase mRNA synthesized in vitro into the fertilized eggs of fish (such as loach, catfishes etc.) to develop the PO generation of transgenic fish. At the juvenile stage, the genomic DNA is extracted from the tail fins, and PCR primers are designed to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of detecting the gene or tag sequence of the transposon system, skin-specific promoters, and bioactive substances. The optimized primer pairs and PCR method were used to obtain positive fish. F0 generation positive fish was crossed with wild type to obtain F1 generation positive fish, F1 generation positive fish was crossed with wild type to obtain F2 generation positive fish, and F3 homozygous positive larvae fish were obtained by PCR screening from F2 generation positive self-bred offspring.",
                        "The invention constructs pT2-krt8-IFN1 and pTol2-krt8-IFN1 vectors, and co-microinjects with mature transposase mRNA synthesized in vitro into fertilized eggs of fish (such as loach, catfishes, etc.), and designs and optimizes two pairs of specific primers for IFN1 (krt8-F1/HIS tag-R1 and krt8-F2/INF1-R5), and develops a stable genetically-transformed homozygous loach.",
                        "The expression vector constructed by the present invention contains a tag sequence, and a bioactive substance can be purified by using a tag antibody: (1) The impurities in the protein solution are removed by centrifugation or ultrafiltration technology, and the centrifugation process is kept at a low temperature to ensure that the bioactive substance is not degraded or the activity is reduced. (2) using a corresponding purification column (such as a nickel column) to purify the protein solution; (3) using ion exchange equipment to further purify the protein. Throughout the purification process, SDS-PAGE staining and Western blot methods can be used to verify the purification effect.",
                        "The present invention needs to select different activity test schemes for different types of biologically active substances: (1) for antiviral biologically active substances (such as IFN1, etc.), the antiviral activity can be detected by using a minimal cytopathic inhibition method, including PCR detection of the replication of the infected virus and the transcription and expression of key factors of its downstream signaling pathways; (2) at the living level, the bioactive substance purified from the mucus at the appropriate dose (such as 1 \u03bcg/g body weight) by intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection to introduce into the experimental animal infected with the virus, the number of deaths is continuously observed and recorded to determine the antiviral effect of the biologically active substance; for the antibacterial biologically active substance (such as antibacterial peptides), the intraperitoneal injection method is used to detect the antibacterial activity of the biologically active substance in the mucus.",
                        "The novel fish bioreactor for skin and mucous glands developed by the invention can efficiently express various biologically active substances. Application schemes include: (1) construction of GMP production workshops, closed production of bioreactors, collection of mucus, extraction, purification and packaging of biologically active substances to achieve large-scale commercial production of biologically active substances; (2) optimization of product production, packaging, transportation, storage and use of various technical links, formulate technical specifications for the safe production of skin and mucous gland bioreactors and the use of biologically active substances; (3) establish demonstration bases, organize professional training, and promote the application of biologically active substances.",
