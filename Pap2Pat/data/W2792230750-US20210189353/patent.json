                                "The glycation of haemoglobin protein (HbA1c) is of particular interest for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. The hyperglycemia associated with diabetes results in the non-enzymatic glycation of blood proteins, including haemoglobin (which has a half-life of 120 days) and albumin (half-life of 20 days). For this reason, the measurement of glycated haemoglobin in the blood is a very powerful method for monitoring the insurgence and development of diabetes. Indeed, while the direct blood sugar level measurement is affected by daily fluctuations, the long lifetime of haemoglobin combined with the slow, yet irreversible, glycation process makes the detection of HbA1c a good indicator of the average blood glucose concentration over a period of 2-3 months. For this reason, in 2010 the American Diabetes Association designated the level of HbA1c as a powerful indicator for the diagnosis of diabetes.",
                                "Since the assessment of glycated haemoglobin is becoming an indispensable part of diabetes diagnosis and control, the HbA1c test demands robustness, high-throughput, and cost effectiveness. As a result, several systems have been developed that are used in the clinics to measure HbA1c. Most methods rely on the separation of HbA1c from non-glycated haemoglobin based on their different chemical properties. These methods include ion exchange chromatography (based on the different isoelectric point), affinity chromatography (based on the different affinity for boronic acid) and capillary electrophoresis (based on the different charge). These current methods, while meeting the requirement for quality and robustness, are based on specialized and expensive techniques that require trained staff and thus fall short for cost-effectiveness and delivery at a point-of-care.",

                                "Based on their activities, Amadoriases have been used to develop and commercialize a fast, easy and cost-effective HbA1c monitoring enzyme-based system (Direct Enzymatic HbA1c Assay, Diazyme Laboratories). Compared to chromatography- and electrophoresis-based sensing methods, the enzymatic assays have the advantage of being simple and inexpensive, hence good candidates for a point-of-care device. However, one of the issues of these enzyme sensors is their unsatisfactory absolute activity and stability. This issue affects storage stability against temperature changes, which in turn limits the applicability of enzymatic HbA1c monitoring systems based on enzymes.",
                                "In addition to the application of Amadoriase enzyme for HbA1c sensing, these enzymes have been proposed as a therapeutic tool for protein deglycation in the human body. However, since the wild type enzymes are able to act only on small substrates or digested proteins, extensive engineering will be necessary before their likely use as therapeutic tool.",
                                "Finally, glycation of food proteins is a drawback effect of several thermal treatment (e.g., milk UHT treatment), which results in alteration of the sensory and nutritional profile of the products. Amadoriase enzymes have a potential use in food industry in controlling and preventing protein glycation in food products, but the enzymes should be able to sustain the thermal treatments without losing activity.",
                                "There are many possible industrial applications where an increased stability of specific enzymes, such as Amadoriases, may be considered beneficial. Indeed, increasing the thermal and pH resistance of these enzymes can often greatly expand their natural operational range, thus allowing the use of engineered enzymes in environments that are unfavorable to their wildtype counterparts.",

In particular, the heat resistant Amadoriase variants of the invention are characterized by specific amino acid changes/mutations that improve the foldability and the thermal stability of the wild type protein. Indeed, the identified heat resistant Amadoriase variants keep the 3D stability and are active up to 95\u00b0 C., while the wild type protein is active only at less than 50\u00b0 C."
