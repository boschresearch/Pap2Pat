## DESCRIPTION

The present invention refers to an Amadoriase enzyme having improved thermostability compared to the wild-type Amadoriase.

The present invention refers also to the use of the thermostabilized Amadoriase as deglycating agent, preferably in the food industry, such as milk pasteurization.

Moreover, the present invention refers to the use of the thermostabilized Amadoriase for determining the level of glycated haemoglobin in a biological sample and therefore for monitoring diabetes.

### STATE OF THE ART

Glycation is the spontaneous, non-enzymatic and irreversible reaction that covalently adds a sugar moiety onto a protein.

The glycation of haemoglobin protein (HbA1c) is of particular interest for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. The hyperglycemia associated with diabetes results in the non-enzymatic glycation of blood proteins, including haemoglobin (which has a half-life of 120 days) and albumin (half-life of 20 days). For this reason, the measurement of glycated haemoglobin in the blood is a very powerful method for monitoring the insurgence and development of diabetes. Indeed, while the direct blood sugar level measurement is affected by daily fluctuations, the long lifetime of haemoglobin combined with the slow, yet irreversible, glycation process makes the detection of HbA1c a good indicator of the average blood glucose concentration over a period of 2-3 months. For this reason, in 2010 the American Diabetes Association designated the level of HbA1c as a powerful indicator for the diagnosis of diabetes.

Since the assessment of glycated haemoglobin is becoming an indispensable part of diabetes diagnosis and control, the HbA1c test demands robustness, high-throughput, and cost effectiveness. As a result, several systems have been developed that are used in the clinics to measure HbA1c. Most methods rely on the separation of HbA1c from non-glycated haemoglobin based on their different chemical properties. These methods include ion exchange chromatography (based on the different isoelectric point), affinity chromatography (based on the different affinity for boronic acid) and capillary electrophoresis (based on the different charge). These current methods, while meeting the requirement for quality and robustness, are based on specialized and expensive techniques that require trained staff and thus fall short for cost-effectiveness and delivery at a point-of-care.

An Alternative Method for HbA1c Detection Exploits the Deglycating Properties of Amadoriases

Amadoriase is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deglycation of Amadori products (fructosyl amino acids or aliphatic amines) to yield free amine, glucosone, and hydrogen peroxide.

Based on their activities, Amadoriases have been used to develop and commercialize a fast, easy and cost-effective HbA1c monitoring enzyme-based system (Direct Enzymatic HbA1c Assay, Diazyme Laboratories). Compared to chromatography- and electrophoresis-based sensing methods, the enzymatic assays have the advantage of being simple and inexpensive, hence good candidates for a point-of-care device. However, one of the issues of these enzyme sensors is their unsatisfactory absolute activity and stability. This issue affects storage stability against temperature changes, which in turn limits the applicability of enzymatic HbA1c monitoring systems based on enzymes.

In addition to the application of Amadoriase enzyme for HbA1c sensing, these enzymes have been proposed as a therapeutic tool for protein deglycation in the human body. However, since the wild type enzymes are able to act only on small substrates or digested proteins, extensive engineering will be necessary before their likely use as therapeutic tool.

Finally, glycation of food proteins is a drawback effect of several thermal treatment (e.g., milk UHT treatment), which results in alteration of the sensory and nutritional profile of the products. Amadoriase enzymes have a potential use in food industry in controlling and preventing protein glycation in food products, but the enzymes should be able to sustain the thermal treatments without losing activity.

There are many possible industrial applications where an increased stability of specific enzymes, such as Amadoriases, may be considered beneficial. Indeed, increasing the thermal and pH resistance of these enzymes can often greatly expand their natural operational range, thus allowing the use of engineered enzymes in environments that are unfavorable to their wildtype counterparts.

The present invention solves the needs of the prior art by identifying heat resistant variants of Amadoriase enzyme characterized by an improved thermal stability compared to the wild type enzyme. In particular, the heat resistant Amadoriase variants of the invention are characterized by specific amino acid changes/mutations that improve the foldability and the thermal stability of the wild type protein. Indeed, the identified heat resistant Amadoriase variants keep the 3D stability and are active up to 95° C., while the wild type protein is active only at less than 50° C.

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Preferably the mRNA/cDNA corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 is SEQ ID NO: 2.

Amadoriases, also known as fructosyl amine oxidases (abbreviated as FAOX or FAOD), are a family of enzymes derived from fungi and bacteria that are able to cleave low molecular weight Amadori product (i.e, glycated amino acids) to yield a free amine, glucosone, and hydrogen peroxide. At present, this enzyme family is composed of around 15 different forms as summarized in Table 1, which share common structural features, such as FAD-binding motifs. The physiological role of eukaryotic FAODs remains unknown, while extensive studies showed that prokaryotic FAOD as the key enzyme in the catabolic pathway of naturally occurring fructosyl amino acids. In this context, Amadoriase is preferably Amadoriase I. Moreover, as already mentioned, in the context of the present invention, the amino acid sequence of the wild type Amadoriase is preferably SEQ ID NO: 1 and the corresponding mRNA/cDNA is SEQ ID NO: 2.

Example

Protein Expression and Purification

The wild type Amadoriase I gene (SEQ ID NO: 3), has been cloned in a pET-3a vector (Novagen).

The double-cysteine mutations were introduced in the wild type sequence using the Quickchange kit (Agilent).

All constructs and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Invitrogen) were then transformed with the mutated DNA and grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin (Sigma).

Cells were grown at 37° C. until A600=0.6 was reached and expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Subsequent overnight protein expression at 25° C. provided soluble protein. The cell lysate was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography.

A second and final purification step using a Hiprep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) was performed to provide 100% sample purity as detected by Coomassie staining. Absorbance at 450 nm was monitored in order to identify the fractions with the most intense yellow color, which is typical of FAD-dependent enzymes.

The fractions of this last affinity chromatography step were collected and dialyzed into a 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0.

Different aliquots of highly purified SS-enzymes (the Amadoriase protein variants) at different concentration have been prepared and stored at −80° C. All the protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay14 kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard.

Enzyme Activity Assay

Enzymatic activity was followed by a continuous assay that detects glucosone formation over time from fructosyl-lysine at 322 nm. The 200 μl reaction mixture contained 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 20 mM o-Phenylenediamine, 2 mM fructosyl-lysine. After 1 minute of pre-incubation, the reaction was started adding 4.5 μg of enzyme, and the increase in absorbance at 322 nm (glucosone ε322=149.25 M−1cm−1) was monitored in a Spark10M (Tecan).

Steady-State Kinetics

Apparent steady-state parameters for the enzymes over its natural substrate were determined by means of the assay described above, with fructosyl-lysine concentrations varied from 0.05 mM to 2 mM. Data points were obtained from three independent experiments. Kinetic parameters were calculated using a non-linear least-square fit of the data, and fitted with Eq. 1 (the Michaelis-Menten equation for hyperbolic substrate kinetics) using Hyperbola fit function of GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif. USA.

\(\begin{matrix}
{v = \frac{V_{\max}*S}{\left( {K_{m} + S} \right)}} & \left( {{Eq}{.1}} \right)
\end{matrix}\)

in which v, Vmax, S, and Km represent the steady state reaction rate, maximum reaction rate, substrate concentration, and Michaelis-Menten constant for the substrate, respectively.

Results of Steady-State Kinetics

Kinetics parameters calculated for the wild type and the two mutants towards fructosyl-lysine are consistent with those reported in literature for other enzymes of the same family. In particular, it is shown that for the SS03 and SS17 variants the mutations do not significantly affect the kinetic parameters when compared with the WT. In other words, the data confirmed that the introduced modifications increase the stability without impairing the catalytic properties of the enzymes.

All the kinetic data are summarized in Table II.

Measurement of Thermal Stability

Thermal stability test was performed using the assay described above after heat treatment, by incubating for 10 minutes the enzyme to target temperature ranging from 25° C. to 100° C. (with 5° C. steps) in the absence of ligands, and then cooling it down at 4° C. until test. The reduced forms of the enzymes were obtained by supplementing the buffer with 100 mM 1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT). After 1 h of incubation, the heat treatment and enzymatic assay are performed as for the oxidized forms. Data points were obtained from three independent experiments.

T50 values were obtained by fitting data with Boltzmann Equation (Eq. 2) with the Boltzmann sigmoidal fit function implemented in GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif. USA.

\(\begin{matrix}
{A = {A_{bottom} + \frac{\left( {A_{top} - A_{bottom}} \right)}{1 + e^{(\frac{T - T_{50}}{S})}}}} & \left( {{Eq}.\mspace{14mu} 2} \right)
\end{matrix}\)

where A represents the residual activity, Abottom the lower asymptote of residual activity, Atop the higher asymptote of residual activity, T the temperature, T50 the temperature at which residual activity is halfway between Atop and Abottom, and s describes the steepness of the curve.

Thermal Stability Results

The thermal stability is assessed by testing the activity of Amadoriase variants from 25° C. to 100° C. and then calculating the T50, that is the temperature at which the enzymes lose 50% of the activity with respect to the activity at 25° C. (see FIG. 2 and Table III).

The results show that the Amadoriase variants of the invention—SS03 and SS17—display a significant improvement in T50 compared to the wild type (WT) enzyme, of ≈3° C. and ≈8° C., respectively.

It is worth noting that, while wild type and SS03 lose completely their activity at temperatures 60° C., the SS17 mutant retains a residual activity of 50% at 60° C. and it is still active after heat treatment at 90° C. (with 6% residual activity (see FIG. 2).

To confirm the disulfides bonds formation we performed the same experiments supplementing the buffer with 100 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), in order to reduce the disulfide bonds.

The results show that all the SS-variants lose the improved thermal resistance and behave very similar to the wild type.

Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination

Crystals of both the SS03 and the SS17 mutant were obtained using the vapor diffusion method at room temperature by mixing a 1 μl drop of ˜15 mg/ml protein sample with an equal volume of a 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 14% PEG4K, 15 isopropanol and 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 14% Peg4K, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide solution respectively. Medium-size (150×100×50 μm) rod-like crystals appeared within a few days. Prior to X-ray data collection, crystals were frozen in a chemically identical solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol for cryo-protection. A 2.19 Å resolution data set was collected from a crystal of SS03 and a 2.85 Å resolution data set was collected from a crystal of SS07, in both cases using λ=1.000 Å in the X06DA-PXIII beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). Diffraction images were processed and scaled using XDS. The structures were determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP from the CCP4 package and the free Amadoriase I structure (PDB code: 4WCT) as the search probe. Model building and refinement were carried out using REFMAC5 and PHENIX. Water molecules were added both automatically using the phenix_refine tool from the PHENIX package and manually from visual inspection of the electron density map.
