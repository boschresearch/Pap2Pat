Due to the limited resolution of complex and arbitrary topologies, classical discrete shape representations using point clouds, voxels, and meshes produce low quality results when used in the above applications. In addition, the resolution of such reconstructions is limited by the predefined number of vertices in the network.",
                                "Further, several implicit 3D shape representation approaches have been proposed to improve both the quality of representations and the impact on downstream applications. However, these methods can only be used to represent topologically closed shapes which greatly limits the class of shapes that they can represent, and they are unable to model surfaces that are open or noisy input data containing holes in the surfaces. As a consequence, they also often need clean, watertight meshes for training. For example, approaches using the Signed Distance Function (SDF F) as the implicit function from (pi, F (pi)) samples where the SDF F (pi) is positive (negative) for points pi inside (outside) the surface. This requires that the ground truth surface be watertight (closed). Since the most 3D shape datasets do not have watertight shapes, preprocessing is needed to create watertight meshes, which can result in loss of surface fidelity.",
                                "Other methods have been attempted, such as machine learning of implicit surface representations directly from raw unoriented point clouds. However, such methods also make an assumption that the underlying surface represented by the point cloud is closed, leading to learned representations necessarily describing closed shapes. Even in cases where the raw input point cloud is scanned from an open surface, learned representations tend to incorrectly close the surface. Since existing approaches assume that the 3D shaped to be modeled are closed, they suffer from a loss of fidelity when modeling open shapes or learning from noisy meshes.",

                        "Turning to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of the system 10 of the present disclosure. The system 10 can be embodied as a central processing unit 12 (processor) in communication with a database 14. The processor 12 can include, but is not limited to, a computer system, a server, a personal computer, a cloud computing device, a smart phone, or any other suitable device programmed to carry out the processes disclosed herein. The system 10 can retrieve data from the database 14 associated with one or more 3D objects.

It should be understood that FIG. 1 is only one potential configuration, and the system 10 of the present disclosure can be implemented using a number of different configurations.",
                        "The database 14 stores 3D data associated with objects with arbitrary topologies, such as point clouds, triangle soups having multiple triangles, mesh data, 3D scan files, 3D data associated with open shapes, 3D data associated with closed shapes, or the like. Additionally and/or alternatively, the database 14 can store digital images and/or digital image datasets of the objects, and one or more outputs from various components of the system 10 (e.g., outputs from a shape representation engine 18a, an unsigned distance field (uDF) module 20a, a normal vector field (nVF) module 20b, a training engine 18b, an iso-surface extraction engine 18c, a shape rendering engine 18d, an evaluation engine 18e, and/or other components of the system 10), one or more untrained and trained computer vision models for 3D surface and/or shape representation, and associated training data. The system 10 can retrieve the 3D data, the digital images, and/or the digital image datasets from the database 14 and process such data for 3D surface and/or 3D shape representations. As such, by the terms \u201cimagery\u201d and \u201cimage\u201d as used herein, it is meant not only 3D imagery and computer-generated imagery, including, but not limited to, triangle soups, point clouds, 3D images, mesh data, open shape data, closed shape data, 3D scan data, etc., but also two-dimensional (2D) data, optical imagery (including scanner and/or camera imagery), or the like.",

The system code 16 can include various custom-written software modules that carry out the steps/processes discussed herein, and can include, but is not limited to, the shape representation engine 18a, the unsigned distance field (uDF) module 20a, the normal vector field (nVF) module 20b, the training engine 18b, the iso-surface extraction engine 18c, the shape rendering engine 18d, and the evaluation engine 18e.

Additionally, the system code 16 can be distributed across multiple computer systems in communication with each other over a communications network, and/or stored and executed on a cloud computing platform and remotely accessed by a computer system in communication with the cloud platform. The system code 16 can communicate with the database 14, which can be stored on the same computer system as the code 16, or on one or more other computer systems in communication with the code 16.",
                        "The system 10 can accurately model both open and closed shapes with high fidelity, arbitrary, and complex topologies. The system 10 can further learn from noisy meshes (e.g., learning directly from raw scan data stored in the form of raw triangle soups). In some embodiments, the system 10 can also learn from watertight meshes.",
                        "The uDF module 20a can include unsigned distance functions that are unambiguously defined for both open and closed shapes. An open shape can be a shape or figure whose line segments, shapes, and/or curves do not meet. For example, open shapes can have one or more gaps in between. A closed shape can be a shape having no openings or gaps. Closed shapes can partition the 3D space into interior and exterior regions. In contrast to the unsigned distance functions, signed distance functions are only defined for closed shapes in existing and conventional technologies. Examples of the uDFs are described in FIGS. 3, 4, and 7.",
                        "The nVF module 20b can generate nVFs using one or more computer vision models (e.g., deep neural networks) that generates normals to the learned surface. The nVFs can compensate non-differentiability of the uDF on the surface, which makes easy availability of surface normals, such as extraction of surface normals, rendering using ray tracing, and optimizing for downstream tasks like shape retrieval. The system 10 can decompose an implicit shape representation into two parts: (1) a uDF, and, (2) an nVF. An implicit shape representation can refer to a shape representation using an implicit function that is not solved for independent variable or variables, which is opposed to an explicit shape representation (e.g., representations based on voxels, point clouds, polygonal meshes, or the like) that refers to a shape representation using an explicit function that is solved for independent variable or variables. A combination of the uDF and nVF can be capable of accurately representing any arbitrary shape with complex topology, irrespective of whether it is open/closed (in contrast to existing implicit shape representations as further described in FIG. 2). Examples of the nVFs are described in FIGS. 3, 6, and 7.",
                        "The training engine 18b can provide a robust loss function to train the nVF to learn directly from noisy triangle soups with oriented normals, while the nVF produces a continuous normal vector field modeling normals to an unoriented surface. For example, the training engine 18b can take the modulo 180\u00b0 of normals into account to reduce errors between nVF and the oriented normals. Examples of the robust loss function are described in FIGS. 5-7.",
                        "The iso-surface extraction engine 18c provides an efficient method to perform multi-resolution iso-surface extraction from uDFs. For example, after the implicit surface representation is learned, the iso-surface extraction engine 18d can convert the uDFs into meshes so that an explicit representation of the surface can be extracted, as further described in FIGS. 8 and 9.",
                        "The shape rendering engine 18d carries out a novel sphere tracing method that utilizes the learned nVF to enable more accurate ray-scene intersection, which can be applied to uDFs. The existing sphere tracing methods can be only applied to signed distance functions which allow for computation of ray-scene intersections using a bisection search close to the surface. However, the existing sphere tracing methods cannot be applied to uDFs due to the fact that the uDFs do not change sign on crossing the surface. The shape rendering engine 18b utilizes the uDFs to get close to the surface and then utilizes the learned nVF close to the surface for accurate ray-scene intersections, as further described in FIGS. 10 and 11.",

As shown in FIG. 2, the DeepSDF system cannot work with raw triangle soups, and both the DeepSDF and the SAL systems cannot represent open shapes. In contrast, the system 10 can learn high fidelity representations of open (and closed) shapes with complex topologies, directly from raw triangle soups. A detailed evaluation about this comparison is described in FIGS. 12-16.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating overall processing steps 50 carried out by the system 10 of the present disclosure.

The data can include a 2D or 3D representation of one or more objects, one or more open shapes with arbitrary topology, a triangle soup having a plurality of triangles, and/or or a plurality of point clouds. The system 10 can obtain the data from the database 14. Additionally and/or alternatively, the system 10 can instruct a shape capture device (e.g., a 3D scanner, a digital camera, a LiDAR device, or the like) to capture the data. In some embodiments, the system 10 can include the shape capture device. Alternatively, the system 10 can communicate with a remote shape capture device. It should be understood that the system 10 can perform the aforementioned task via the shape representation engine 18a. Still further, it is noted that the system 10, in step 52, can receive and process imagery and/or data provided to the system 10 by an external and/or third-party computer system.",

The one or more computer vision models can include one or more deep neural networks (DNN). The unsigned distance field (uDF) can be indicative of proximity to the 3D surface. The normal vector field (nVF) can be indicative of a surface orientation of the 3D surface. The uDF can include a predicted closest unsigned distance to a surface point of the 3D surface from a given point in a 3D space, and the nVF comprises a predicted normal vector to the surface point closest to the given point.",

Compared with a signed distance field (sDF), the uDF is nondifferentiable at the surface. For example, as can be seen in FIG. 4 (which is graph 60 representing non-differentiability of a uDF on a surface of a shape), on the left of the graph 60, uDF values are sampled along line l1 for both an estimated unsigned distance function and an ideal unsigned distance function. Similarly, sDF values are sampled along line l1 for both an estimated signed distance function and an ideal signed distance function. The uDF is differentiable except at the surface (e.g., the point (0, 0)). On the right of the graph 60, the uDF and sDF with sampled points on line l1 are visualized. To make the uDF differentiable, the system 10 can sample training data points slightly away from the surface. Since estimation of high quality surface normals is important for several downstream tasks, the system 10 extract the surface normal using the nVF to compensate the non-differentiability of the uDF. For any 3D location, x, a nVF represents the nVF normal to the surface point closest to x. Formally,",

So, the ambiguity of n or \u2212n can be handled. This implies a modulo 180\u00b0 representation in the DNN suffices. However, such a representation needs to be learned from a noisy triangle soup with oriented surface normals with possible directional incoherence (in the modulo 180\u00b0 sense) between adjacent triangles. For example, as shown in FIG. 6 (which is graph 100 illustrating a surface normal and a modulo 180\u00b0 of the surface normal used by the system 10 of the present disclosure), for a triangle soup, adjacent faces can have oppositely facing normals (e.g., in the modulo 180\u00b0 sense).",

For example, the system 10 trains the DNNs based at least in part on minimizing uDF (e.g., shown Equation (4)) and nVF (e.g., shown Equation (5)). After training, the zero-level set of f\u03b8, which approximates the uDF, represents points on the surface, while f\u03b8, approximating nVF, represents the surface normals of the corresponding points on this level set.",

The give point x is slightly away from the 3D surface. The nVF(x) represents a normal to the surface point closest to the give point x. The model architecture 104 inputs the give point x into a DNN f\u03b8to approximate the uDF(x) and inputs the give point x into a DNN f\u03b8to approximate the uVF(x) by minimizing loss functions uDF(x) and nVF (x).",

For example, FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the step 58A of FIG. 3 in the greater detail. Beginning in step 120, the system 10 creates a voxel grid for the uDF at a first resolution. The voxel grid has a first plurality of voxels. For example, as shown in FIG. 9 (which illustrates a multi-resolution iso-surface extraction for uDFs performed by the system 10 of the present disclosure), the system 10 creates a voxel grid having a first plurality of voxels 132 (e.g., squares) covering a surface 134 represented by multiple uDFs (e.g., a uDF(x1) and a uDF(x2) as examples). The surface 134 is simplified for illustration. It should be understood that the surface 134 can be 2D or 3D surface having arbitrary and open shapes.",

The selected group of voxels has a resolution higher than the first resolution. The non-selected group of voxels has the first resolution. For example, as shown in FIG. 9, the system 10 selects a first group of voxels 136 (e.g., voxels marked by \u201c\u221a\u201d) from the first plurality of voxels 132 as a first subdivision 140 based at least in part on that at least one corner of each voxel of the first group of voxels 136 has a predicted closest unsigned distance (e.g., uDF(x1) or the uDF(x2) less than an edge length (e.g., h0) of a voxel of the first plurality of voxels 132). The first group of voxels 136 are more proximity to the surface 134 than non-selected voxels 138 (e.g., voxels marked by \u201cx\u201d) of the first plurality of voxels 132. The system 10 can increase a resolution of the subdivision 140 to a second resolution (e.g., a smaller voxel size) higher than the first resolution. The first subdivision 140 at the second resolution has a second plurality of voxels 142 greater than the first group of voxels 136. The system 10 selects a second group of voxels 144 (e.g. voxels marked by \u201c\u221a\u201d) from the second plurality of voxels 142 as a second subdivision 150 based at least in part on that at least one corner of each voxel of the second group of voxels 144 has a predicted closest unsigned distance less than an edge length (e.g., h1) of a voxel of the second plurality of voxels 142. The second group of voxels 144 are more proximity to the 3D surface than non-selected voxels 146 (e.g., voxels marked by \u201cx\u201d) and the first group of voxels 136.

In step 126, the system 10 extracts iso-surface of the 3D representation based at least in part on the mesh. For example, the system 10 can extract an iso-surface that represents points of a constant value (also referred to iso-values), which can be determined by a user or the system 10.",

In some embodiments, a sphere tracing uDFs is used to render images from a distance field that represents the shape. To create an image, rays are cast from the focal point of the camera, and their intersection with the scene is computed using sphere tracing uDFs. Roughly speaking, irradiance/radiance computations are performed at the point of intersection to obtain the color of the pixel for that ray. For example, FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating the step 58B of FIG. 3 in the greater detail. Beginning in step 200, the system 10 casts a plurality of rays from a viewpoint. For example, the system 10 casts a plurality of rays from a focal point of the camera.",

In some embodiments, the system 10 processes each ray originating at a first point using an iterative marching to obtain a second point using a step size of a predicted closest unsigned distance to the 3D surface from the first point along the ray direction.",
                        "For example, as shown in FIG. 11 (which illustrates a graph 210 showing a sphere tracing procedure and a graph 220 leveraging a nVF for obtaining more accurate ray-scene intersections performed by the system 10 of the present disclosure), given a ray, r, originating at point, p0, iterative marching along the ray is performed to obtain its intersection with the surface. In the first iteration, this translates to taking a step along the ray with a step size of uDF(p0) to obtain the next point p1=p0+r*uDF(p0). Since uDF(p0) is the smallest distance to the surface, the line segment [p0, p1] of the ray r does not intersect the surface (p1 can touch but not transcend the surface). The above step is iterated i times till pi is \u2208 close to the surface. The i-th iteration is given by pi=pi-1+uDF(pi) and the stopping criteria uDF(pi)\u2264\u2208.",
                        "The system 10 can further determine that the iterative marching stops at a stop point for each ray. The stop point is close to the 3D surface. For example, as shown in FIG. 11, the iterative marching stops at the point pi 212.",

In some embodiments, if the ray is close enough to the surface, the system 10 can use a local planarity assumption (without loss of generalization) to obtain the intersection estimate. For example, as shown in the graph 220 of FIG. 11, if the sphere tracing of the uDF stops at a point pi, the system 10 evaluates the nVF as n=nVF(pi), and computes a cosine of an angle \u03b8 between the nVF (e.g., n=f\u03b8(pi)) and the ray direction r. An estimated intersection 222 is then obtained as pproj=pi+r*uDF(pi)/(r\u00b7n).",

                        "Referring back to FIG. 3, in some embodiments, in step 58C, the system 10 evaluates the 3D representation. For example, the system 10 uses several metrics for evaluation, such as a depth error, a normal map error, an IOU error. The system 10 can evaluate a mean absolute error (MAE) between a ground truth depth map and an estimated depth map which can obtained by sphere tracing the learned 3D representation. This error is evaluated only on the \u201cvalid\u201d pixels, which the system 10 defines to be the pixels which have non-infinite depth in both the ground truth and estimated depth map. This metric captures the accuracy of ray-isosurface intersection. The system 10 can evaluate a normal map error. Similarly, the system 10 can evaluate the L2 distance between the sphere-traced normal map and the ground truth normal map for the valid pixels. Since the surface normals play a vital role in rendering, this metric is informative of the fidelity of the final render. Regarding the IOU, since both depth error and normal map error are evaluated only on the valid pixels, they do not quantify whether the geometry of the final shape is correct. Therefore, the system 10 also evaluates Pixel IOU, which is defined as,",

Second, the system 10 selects the Split Sphere (S), to analyze how well the 3D representation disclosed herein can model the gap between the spheres. Finally, the system 10 evaluates on Intersecting Planes (IP), a triangle soup with complex topology.",
                        "In some embodiments, to generate the 3D representations for the shapes B, S, and IP, the system 10 can start off with a triangle soup normalized between [\u22120.5, 0.5], and densely sample 250,000 points on the faces of the triangles. For each of these points, the associated normal for training the nVF is the normal of the face from which it is sampled from. The system 10 can randomly perturb these 250,000 points along the xyz axes using the same strategy followed in the DeepSDF. For each of these 25,0000 points, the system 10 can find the nearest point in the unperturbed set of points, and compute the distance between them. These distances are used to train the uDF. Additionally, the system 10 can also sample 25,000 points uniformly in the space, and follow the same procedure for creating the ground truth. Finally, the system 10 can use 90% of this data for training and 10% for validation and train DUDE using these samples. For both f\u03b8and f\u03b8, the system 10 can use a 6 layer MLP with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations and 512 hidden units in each layer. An optimizer (e.g., Adam optimizer) is used with le-4 learning rate. Note, for training the DeepSDF, the system 10 can first convert the mesh to watertight using the existing procedure before sampling points in the space.",
                        "FIG. 12 illustrates visualizations 250 of implicit 3D shape representations learned on three shapes. While the DeepSDF system learns over-smoothed representations (top row) owing to the intermediate watertighting step, the SAL system learns to close out regions which are intended to be open (middle row). Additionally, both the DeepSDF and the SAL systems have poor surface normal estimates on open surfaces (middle row) and complex topology (bottom row). In contrast, the DUDE system learns high fidelity shape representations while at the same time generating visually pleasing renderings on complex shapes owing to the high quality normals estimated by a separately learned nVF. For the Bathtub model, a loss in fidelity is observed due to the watertighting process. The SAL seems to retain some of the details, but the normal estimation fails, leading to low quality rendering. For the Split Sphere, no loss is fidelity is recorded owing to the simplicity of the shape, but the watertighting process distorts the geometry to cause inconsistent surface normals. This is primarily the reason why the renderings from the DeepSDF do not look visually good. On the other hand, the SAL appears to close out the split sphere. However, the DUDE system obtains visually good results, owing to high quality surface normals obtained from the learned nVF. A similar trend follows for the Intersecting Planes model. It is clearly shown that learning a separate nVF is needed to obtain precise surface normal in addition to the learned distance fields near the surface.",

Similarly, for the Split Sphere (S), that SAL performs the worst, as it has a tendency to fill up gaps. Additionally, on the Intersecting Planes (IP), the SAL is marginally worse than DeepSDF.",
