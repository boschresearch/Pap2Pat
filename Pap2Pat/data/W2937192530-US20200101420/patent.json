                        "The global scarcity of freshwater resources drives intensive research attention to solar desalination which can provide clean water directly from sunlight with minimum environmental impact. Many studies have explored high-efficiency solar desalination devices, and practical challenges are posed by complicated fabrication requirements, high cost, and scalability. In the direct approach such as solar stills and chimneys, a solar collector is coupled with a distillation mechanism and the process is carried out in one simple cycle. Large-scale deployment of such devices is limited by cost and losses in system efficiency associated with heat and mass transfer during evaporation and condensation.",
                        "Water evaporation using porous carbon nanomaterials is a promising technique for producing fresh water from salt water or other wastewater using abundant solar energy with high efficiency. With rapid development of nanotechnologies in recent years, two key elements for efficient solar driven desalination have been defined: 1) broadband solar absorption using nanomaterials, such as plasmonic nanoparticles, graphite and graphene, and 2) localized heat management using nano-structures such as porous nano-capillary channels for efficient vapor generation with minimized parasitic heat energy loss to bulk liquid. Compared with traditional solar desalination, these nano-structures can double the light-to-heat conversion efficiency resulting in an increase of the pure water production from 0.5 to 1.0 kg/m2\u00b7h under 1 sun illumination (1 kWm\u22122). It has been reported that graphite-carbon foam and porous N-doped graphene with 0.426 and 53 Wm\u22121K\u22121 of thermal conductivity have produced 66% and 80% of energy conversion, respectively.",
                        "Further fundamental understanding of solar thermal conversion and heat transfer in these nano-structured materials and a solution of practical processibility such as module design and fabrication cost are required to impact existing desalination issues. These solar evaporation systems have not been as effective as energy intensive distillation and membrane distillation systems which can produce 30-40 kg/m2\u00b7h of sea water desalination. They have technical limitations in terms of the permeate flux, resulting from intrinsic material structure and properties such as hydrophilic nano-capillary channels for heat localization. Features of these nanostructures such as floating and wettable surfaces do not allow effective additional driving forces such as the use of vacuum or sweeping airflow. Therefore, nanostructured solar evaporation systems such as floating substrates are limited to use as small-scale portable devices.",
                        "Membrane distillation is a thermally driven separation process using hydrophobic microporous polymer membranes. The hydrophobicity of the membrane helps trap the liquid feed on the upstream side, while the microporous structure allows water vapor permeation through the membrane. Energy requirements are high for currently used membrane distillation desalination processes, but use of waste heat and renewable energy could enable large cost savings. A solar desalination panel with direct-contact membrane distillation and nanophotonics has been developed to allow the thermal management system to be scaled to allow higher operating temperatures and water flow rates. However, this approach is limited in a planar membrane module system by low photothermal conversion efficiency due to the polymer membrane, in which small pores, porosity, and thickness dominate the permeation vapor flux."

A housing comprising a light transmitting wall can be provided, and the solar distillation membrane positioned in the housing to receive solar radiation transmitted through the light transmitting wall.

The precursor composition will cover surfaces and pores of the graphitic foam, such that when the hydrophobic composition is formed from the precursor composition the hydrophobic composition will cover the surface and the pores of the graphitic foam. The application of the hydrophobic composition can combine with the nanotexture of the graphitic foam to render the surface of the graphitic foam superhydrophobic.",

For example, in one embodiment the distillation membrane can be in the shape of a vessel for forming the water chamber and containing the feed liquid, and also for distilling that liquid through the walls of the distillation vessel that comprise the distillation membrane. The vessel can be open or closed. The distillation membrane can be tubular with an open interior, the open interior of the tubular distillation membrane forming the water chamber and water vapor distilling through the distillation membrane forming the tube.",
                        "The condenser can be of any suitable construction. The condenser can be active as by heat exchange with a pumped liquid, or passive as by a condensing coil. In one embodiment, the condenser comprises a feed water heat exchange conduit, which receives feed water from a source and exchanges heat with the water vapor to condense the water vapor to liquid water. This heat exchange also serves to pre-heat the feed water, which assists in evaporating the feed water into water vapor at the distillation membrane.",

The pre-heating chamber can be in the form of a solar water heater. Several constructions are known and can be used. Also, the pre-heater can be a metal pipe which is blackened on the outside to facilitate solar absorption. The pipe can be covered by a graphitic foam. The graphitic foam is black and also conducts heat extremely well. The pre-heating chamber can be hermetically isolated from the vapor chamber by a vapor/air impermeable and thermally insulated wall.",

The nano/micro particles can be adhered within the pores of the graphitic foam by a suitable resin or other method. The nano/micro particles can be carbon based or ceramic. The nano/micro particles can be graphite and/or ceramic oxide or other materials. It is possible to use one material for nano particles and in the same membrane use another material for micro particles, and to apply both to the surface of the graphitic foam to further limit the pore size at the surface and increase the surface texture to increase superhydrophobicity.",

The nano/micro particles can comprise both nano particles and micro particles, and if so the size of such particles can be selected from any high value and low value selected from these values, with the nano particle range having a lower low value than the low value of the micro particle range, and a high value less than the high value of the micro particle range. The nano/micro particles should have a diameter less than the pore size of the graphitic foam.",

For example, the particle concentration could be \u02dc30 wt % of particle in liquid (resin+dilution agent, ethanol) for the first coating. To control the pore size, smaller particles can then be used with 2\u02dc10 wt % of particle solution. The graphite foam has 100 um\u02dc5 mm cell size and 5 um\u02dc1 mm of pore sizes. The pore size refers to the opening window between the cells, and the cell is a roundish chamber formed by the expanding gasses. The nano-particles should be smaller than the pore and the cell size, and are in the nano-level in size, where the pore and the cells of the graphitic foam are usually about 100 micron to 500 micron in size. The slurry of these nano particles should be viscous enough to not penetrate more than one or two cells through the pores (windows) as it is coated on the surfaced, but thin enough to fill the cell completely.",

The thermal insulating wall 158 can be impenetrable to vapor and air. A feed water inlet 174 receives feed water and treated water is exhausted through treated water exhaust 178.",
                        "The membrane 182 of the solar distillation apparatus 150 in this embodiment is tubular. A suitable condenser 186 can be provided, and can have suitable condenser structure such as cooling fins 188. A preheater 202 can be provided to preheat water prior to the distillation membrane 182. The preheater 202 can operate by solar radiation, waste heat, or other suitable energy sources. The preheater 202 can be provided in the preheating chamber 166. Other constructions are possible. The preheater 202 can be a thermally conductive conduit with a solar absorptive coating such as the graphitic foam outer layer that is shown. Metal conduit with the outside painted black, or other preheating sources, is possible. Condensate 210 escapes through condensate collection opening 190 into a suitable container 194 or other apparatus.",
                        "The arrangement shown in FIG. 9 provides an efficient use of energy and space. Water enters at the feed water inlet 174 and passes through the condenser 186, where it is heated by the condensing water vapor. The water then travels from the distillation chamber 162 into the preheating chamber 166 through a connecting conduit 198. The water there enters the preheater 202. Solar radiation 224 passes the transmissive top 170 and heats the graphitic foam outer layer of the preheater 202. Water passing through the preheater is heated to facilitate vaporization at the distillation membrane 182. Solar radiation 224 from sun 220 or other radiation source strikes the graphitic foam of the distillation membrane 182. Heat is transferred from the graphitic foam to feed water flowing through the open interior of the tubular graphitic foam distillation membrane 182. Water vapor 206 passes through the pores of the distillation membrane 182 and contaminants and salt particles remain and exit with remaining water through treated water exhaust 178. The water vapor 206 will condense on fins 188 of the condenser 186, and the droplets 210 will exit through condensate collection opening 190 into container 194 or other condensate collection conduit. Feed water flow 234 into the feed water inlet 174 can be controlled by operation of a suitable valve 230. The flow of a liquid exhaust stream 238 can be controlled by operation of a suitable valve 231. A gas exhaust 239 can be provided and controlled by a valve 240 and/or pump 241 to control the atmosphere within the distillation chamber 162. The application of a vacuum or a positive pressure flow over the distillation membrane 182 can assist with vaporization of the feed water at the distillation membrane 182.",
                        "Operation of the distillation apparatus 150 will be more efficient if air 201 (FIG. 10) in the distillation chamber 162 is evacuated prior to operation. The air will otherwise absorb solar radiation, preventing it from reaching the distillation membrane, and will also interfere with the production and migration of water vapor from the membrane 182 to the condenser 186. The presence of air 201 in the preheating chamber 166 will not markedly affect the performance of the preheater 202. The vacuum pump 241 can be utilized to exhaust air 201 from the distillation chamber 162 prior to operation.",
                        "It is possible to utilize vapor from the distillation membrane 182 to drive air 201 from the distillation chamber 162 prior to operation of the device. As shown in FIGS. 10-11, in the initial condition the valve 240 is closed and flow through the gas exhaust conduit 239 is not possible. The valve 230 is opened to permit water to enter the system, however, the valve 231 can be closed to prevent treated water exhaust until evacuation of the air 201 and operation of the distillation apparatus 150 has been normalized. The water will flow to the distillation membrane 182 and generate water vapor 206 in the distillation chamber 162 (FIG. 11). The valve 240 can be opened and the generation of water vapor 206 will drive air from the distillation chamber 162. The valve 240 can then be closed and the valve 231 opened to begin normal operation of the solar distillation apparatus 150.",
                        "The invention has applications other than solar distillation. The invention can be used for other separation processes. A separation membrane according to the invention can have a graphitic foam and a surface coating of a hydrophobic composition on the surface and pores of the graphitic foam. The surface of the graphitic foam can thereby be rendered superhydrophobic. The dimensions and porosity of the separation membrane can be adjusted to the separation process for which the separation membrane will be used by the addition of micro/nano pores into surface cells of the membrane.",
                        "The graphitic foam is black which assists in absorption of solar light and heating of the membrane and thereby the transition of water to water vapor.

Water at the surface on the liquid side of the solar distillation membrane will be vaporized and the water vapor will pass through pores of the graphitic foam, and liquid water will be repelled by the superhydrophobic surface of the solar distillation membrane. The water vapor emerges from the pores at the vapor side of the membrane.",
                        "The water vapor can be condensed by any suitable process. In one embodiment, the water vapor is contacted with feed water to simultaneously heat the feed water while condensing the water vapor. Different heat exchange designs and constructions to accomplish this heat transfer are possible. The method of the invention can therefore include the step of supplying feed water to a condenser prior to the solar distillation membrane, and exchanging heat with the collected water vapor distilled through the solar distillation membrane, whereby the water vapor will be condensed and the feed water will be heated.",
                        "The method can also include the step of pre-heating the feed water prior to the distillation membrane. The pre-heating can be accomplished by any suitable method, and in one embodiment includes a pre-heater that is positioned to receive solar radiation and to transfer heat absorbed from the solar radiation to the liquid water prior to contact with the distillation membrane.",
                        "The solar distillation membrane can be provided at one location and the condensing step can be performed at another location defining a vapor space. The method can include the step of withdrawing air from the vapor space between the solar distillation membrane and the condensing location prior to starting condensing of the water vapor. The withdrawing of air can be by vacuum.",
                        "The withdrawing of air can also be accomplished by water vapor pressure. The condensing step is not started until the withdrawing of air step has been completed, and water vapor from the solar distillation membrane forces air from the vapor space. Hot water vapor is passed through the membrane and cold water through the condenser. If the gas valve on the chamber is opened, steam will drive out the air with it, and eventually there will be little air in the system. The gas valve is closed, and then the valve is opened to permit water to flow through the condenser at 25\u00b0 C. This drops the vapor pressure of the water around the condenser to approximately 23.7 torr, creating a significant pressure gradient. The low pressure around the condenser will effectively reduce the pressure around the membrane, acting like a vacuum. In this case the vacuum pump is actually the condenser as it condenses the water from the vapor space. This reduced pressure around the membrane will cause the water to evaporate at a much increased rate from the water in the membrane, thus substantially increasing the through put of the fresh water.",

The intrinsic graphitic foam has a total reflectance of 0.155 (light absorption [A]=84.5%) over a wavelength range of 330-2500 nm (typical solar radiation). Coating the surface with fluorosilane molecules resulted in the surface of the foam becoming darker, reducing the total reflectance to 0.068 (A=93.2%). The self-assembled thin molecular coating changed the reflective index of the surface, increasing the solar absorption. The fluorosilane coating on the surface of carbon nanoparticle membrane further reduced the total reflectance to 0.036 (A=96.4%) since the molecular coating created a surface with nano-scale roughness and hence the light absorption was enhanced. The intrinsic nanoparticle membrane showed 0.052 total reflectance (A=94.8%). See FIG. 14. Separation performance was tested using a batch membrane vessel device including a membrane cup and a lid. The membrane vessel was fabricated by a similar method, as described above. The difference was that the intermediate layer was formed with 500 nm nanoparticles with a knife casting.

The concentrated solar intensity (e.g., 1-3 sun intensity) was calibrated while maintaining the distance between the midpoint of the outer surface of the lamp and the vessel surface. With solar-thermal simulation, the ambient temperature 5 cm above the graphitic foam chamber was \u224837.2\u00b0 C. at 0.87 sun. Under concentrated solar-thermal irradiation at 0.87 sun, the membrane vessel was heated up to \u02dc60\u00b0 C. and MD vapor permeation flux increased significantly to 1.25 kg m\u22122 h\u22121, compared to the nominal one sun intensity because more IR light was applied to the device surfaces (FIG. 18 and FIG. 19). The high permeation flux of MD has been attributed to its higher thermal driving force, \u039415.8\u00b0 C. FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 show the temperature and permeate flux profiles as a function of simulated solar-thermal intensity. The temperature of the device chamber and the permeate flux increased as the solar-thermal intensity increased as a result of the increased light and heat absorption. At an intensity of 3 sun, the MD-200 \u03bcm system showed higher vapor flux than the control glass chamber. The MD permeate performance of 6.6 kg m\u22122h\u22121 at 3 sun intensity is comparable to that of the polymer air gap MD membrane (e.g., 1-5 kg m\u22122h\u22121 for seawater desalination).",

FIG. 15 shows characteristics of desalination performance based on the different distillation module systems: open-vessel distillation (OD), flow channel distillation (FD), and membrane distillation (MD).

For the dry run (without salt-water), the OD vessel with an SP-NP-GF layer was heated to \u224847\u00b0 C. in 10 min; for OD desalination, it was heated to \u224837.9\u00b0 C. in 30 min, resulting in an effective permeate flux of 1.02 kg m\u22122 h\u22121 (calculated from 0.5 to 1 h) with a vapor-generation efficiency of 63.9%. Under concentrated solar-thermal irradiation at 0.87 sun, the OD vapor permeation flux increased significantly to 2.26 kg m\u22122 h\u22121, respectively, because more IR light was applied to the device surfaces.
