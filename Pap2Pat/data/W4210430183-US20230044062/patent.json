                        "Modern electron microscopes can focus sub-angstrom electron beams on and between atoms to quantify structure and chemistry in real space from elastic and inelastic scattering processes. Reliable interpretation of atomic structure at higher-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is provided by elastically scattered electrons collected in an annular detector (e.g. an annular dark field (ADF) or an annular bright field (ABF)) or pixelated detector (PD), however this signal under-describes the chemistry. The chemical composition of specimens is revealed by spectroscopic techniques produced from inelastic interactions in the form of energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). From these signals, or modalities, each atom's chemical identity and coordination provides essential information about the performance of nanomaterials across a wide range of applications from clean energy, batteries, and opto-electronics, among many others. Unfortunately, high-resolution chemical imaging often exceeds the dose limits of a specimen-chemical maps are noisy or missing entirely. Dose limits force a tradeoff between SNR, resolution, and the materials that can be imaged.",
                        "In conventional techniques, the signal from each detector\u2014such as ADF and EDX/EELS\u2014are analyzed separately and correlated to provide insight to structural, chemical, or optical properties by overlaying information acquired from multiple detectors. However, correlative imaging disregards the shared information between structure and chemistry and misses an opportunity to recover useful information. In some examples, data fusion techniques go further than correlative imaging by linking the separate signals collected during an experiment to reconstruct new information or improve measurement accuracy. Successful data fusion designs an analytical model that faithfully represents the relationship between modalities, and yields a meaningful combination without imposing any artificial connections.",
                        "Spectroscopic experiments simultaneously collect multiple modalities where each signal is acquired with different SNRs. ADF micrographs contain contrast proportional to the atomic number (Z) via Rutherford scattering producing images with high SNR at lower doses (e.g., 103 e/\u212b2). Unfortunately, Z-contrast imaging can only distinguish well separated atoms with noticeably different atomic numbers. Spectral images are usually severely degraded by higher noise than ADF signals and high radiation doses are required (e.g. >106 e/\u212b2). ABF and pixelated detectors can also provide Z-contrast imaging of light elements over a range of specimen thicknesses. More reliable interpretation of material chemistry is needed, e.g., by linking these inelastic and elastic modalities.",
                        "Electron tomography extends the capabilities of an electron microscope into three dimensional (3D) imaging by collecting many two dimensional (2D) projections of the specimen across an angular range by rotating the specimen. Unlike 2D imaging, electron tomography is an underdetermined problem, which means it requires reconstruction algorithms to best estimate the true 3D specimen structure. In principle, when used in combination with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) or electron energy loss (EELS) spectroscopy, electron tomography can characterize complex three-dimensional (3D) material chemistry at the nanoscale. However in practice, chemical tomography demands significantly high electron doses that almost always exceed the specimen limits (e.g. >107 e/\u212b2). At best, investigators choose between measuring 3D structure with annular dark field detector (ADF) tomography or characterizing chemistry along a single viewing direction. Reliable 3D chemical reconstructions of specimens is needed, e.g. by linking inelastic (EDX and/or EELS) and elastic modalities (ADF and/or ABF and/or pixelated detector) in the reconstruction process."

The techniques herein are able to recover chemical maps (in the form of image data or other map data) by reformulating the inverse problem as a numerical optimization that seeks solutions that surpass traditional dose limits. The techniques herein are able to substantially improve SNRs for chemical maps, by around 300-500% in various examples, while remaining consistent with original measurements. We demonstrate on a diverse set of EDX/EELS datasets at high-resolution for nanoparticle catalysts and supercapacitors. Moreover, the fused multi-modal electron microscopy techniques herein are able to recover a specimen's relative concentration, allowing researchers to measure local stoichiometry within <15% error.

As we highlight on both synthetic and experimental datasets, with the present techniques, multi-modal electron microscopy generates quantitatively accurate 2D maps or 3D volumes with pixel/voxel values that directly reflect the materials chemistry. The techniques open new pathways for low-dose chemical imaging in 2D or 3D. For example, applications are now available where all scattered signals can be collected and used in a meaningful way. Whether via integration through pixel array detectors and/or spectroscopic methods, fused multi-modal spectroscopy techniques herein provide for linking data to increase the utility of all detected information.",
                        "In various examples, the systems and methods are described for providing electron microscopy that uses multiple modes, termed herein multi-modal electron microscopy. Systems and methods are provided for fused multi-modal electron microscopy that recovers chemical maps (e.g., in the form of image data or other map data) by instituting an optimization process. In particular, in various examples, the systems and methods recover chemical maps by solving an optimization problem seeking a solution (i.e. chemical maps) that strongly correlates with three objectives: (1) a model based comparison of the chemical maps with the measured annular or pixelated detector modality (2) the recovered chemical maps retain consistency with the measured spectroscopic modality (EELS and/or EDX), and (3) the solution favors sparse structure in gradient or image domain. Thus, the systems and methods are able to resolve an optimization problem with a model based relationship between the SNR limited and rich signals, where the recovered solution retains consistency with the original measurements defined by its noise statistics and is maximally sparse in the gradient domain. In various examples, systems and methods are described for fused multi-modal electron microscopy techniques that combine both annular dark field detector (ADF) and/or annular bright field detector (ABF) and/or pixelated detector data and energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) data and/or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data for generating chemical 2D and 3D maps. Examples of ADF techniques include high-angle, medium-angle, and low-angle ADF. Further while various examples are described and illustrated in reference to ADF signal data, such references are meant to include the use of annular bright field (ABF) and pixelated detector signal data. These signals can come directly from annular detectors or integrated signals on a pixelated detector (e.g. Segmented Annular Detectors, charged coupled devices (CCD), complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices, or pixel array detectors (PAD)).",

The choice of Z and y values are chosen to best model the electron scattering. TV is channel-wise total variation minimization (also referred to as the \u201cregularization\u201d term).

                        "For various techniques herein, these three optimization functions define a multi-modal approach capable of surpassing traditional dose limits for chemical imaging. In various examples, a number of heuristics were applied as part of the techniques. First, we assumed a forward model where the simultaneous annular detector is the linear combination of elemental distributions. This incoherent linear imaging approximation for elastic scattering scales as Z\u03b3 where gamma is typically between 1.33 and 2 for ADF. Second, we ensured the recovered signals maintain a high-degree of data fidelity with the initial measurements by using maximum negative log-likelihood for spectroscopic measurements dominated by low-count Poisson statistics. In a higher count regime, this term can could be substituted with a simple least-squares error. Lastly, we utilized channel-wise total variation (TV) regularization to enforce a sparse gradient magnitude, which reduces noise and promotes image smoothness. Further, in various examples, each of these three terms can be weighted by a different coefficient that ensures accurate convergence of the optimization problem. Terms in the optimization function can be removed by setting the corresponding weighting coefficient \u03bbi to zero."

However, noise in the fused multi-modal chemical map applying the present techniques is virtually eliminated (see, FIG. 1D) and allows for recovering chemical structure without a loss of resolution\u2014including the interface of the nanoparticle core and the oxide shell (FIG. 1E). FIG. 1E illustrates the overlay map of the Co, S, and O chemical maps shown in FIG. 1D produced by the present techniques. The chemical maps produced by fused multi-modal EM quantitatively agreed with the expected stoichiometry\u2014the specimen core contained a relative concentration of 39\u00b11.6%, 42\u00b12.5% and 13\u00b12.4% and exterior shell composition of 26\u00b12.8%, 11\u00b12.0%, 54\u00b11.3% for Co, S, O respectively. These estimates for core-shell concentrations are robust and remain consistent at lower doses \u02dc104 e/\u212b2.",

The composite Co\u2014Mn oxide examined in FIGS. 2B-2E was designed to achieve a synergy between cobalt oxide's high specific capacitance and manganese oxide's long life cycle. While the Co3\u2212xMnxO4 nanoparticle appears chemically homogeneous in the ADF projection image along the [100] direction (as shown in FIG. 2C), core-shell distinctions are hinted at in the raw EELS maps (FIG. 2B). Specifically, these nanoparticles contain a Mn-rich center with a Co shell and homogeneous distribution of O. However the raw EELS maps are excessively degraded by noise preventing additional analysis beyond characterizing the basic morphology of the specimen. Yet, using the present techniques, the multi-modal reconstructions (shown in FIG. 2D) confirms that the Co-rich shell is crystalline and maps the Co/Mn interface in greater detail (as shown in the EELS overlay map of FIG. 2E). Because the ADF lacks contrast from oxygen scattering, the resulting map is featureless and benefits mostly from regularization.",

The ratio of atomic concentrations is calculated from the ratio of scattering cross section against core-loss intensity. Accurate knowledge of all experimental parameters (e.g. beam energy, specimen-thickness, collection angles) and accurate calculation of the inelastic cross-section typically provides errors roughly between 5-10%. Cross-sections can be measured experimentally with a standard specimen of known thickness and stoichiometry or estimated theoretically by the Hartree-Slater model. EDX similarly is unable to extract relative concentrations without a calibration specimen. Relative intensities of EDX peaks depends on the detector, addressed by the k-factor method. To achieve an accuracy better than 15%, appropriate k-factors needs to be measured for each analyzed element, using test specimens of known composition with the same detector and microscope.",

FIG. 5B is a visualization of three points on the phase diagram corresponding to the increasing ADF/chemical electron dose. The input images were generated by linear projections of the 3D chemical compositions, highlighted in FIG. 5C. In order to compare the algorithms at different noise levels, we scaled the intensities of the ground truth images to different average electron counts per pixel before applying random Poisson noise. This simulates the usage of different beam currents and dwell times, resulting in different electron doses. We evaluated image quality by measuring the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed relative concentration maps against the ground truth.",

The map for multimodal reconstruction shows a predictably smooth degradation in recovery as the measured signals diminish. Examples of Poisson noises of simulated images can be found in FIG. 5B. The Co map closely mirrors the Z-contrast observed in ADF simply because it is the heaviest element present.

Noise structure present in the raw maps may persist in the reconstruction and can be mistaken as potential lattice sites, especially if its position is overlapping with atoms visible in the ADF. Amorphous elements can be mischaracterized as crystalline or fake atoms could misidentified as interstitial defects. Thus, in various examples, the techniques herein may deploy one of two methods for resolving the spurious atoms possibility: (1) bin the data in Fourier Space and retain an area shorter than the first-order Brag Peaks, or (2) implement a multi-resolution reconstruction. Reconstructing the data in a lower resolution space not only reduces the computational complexity but also enhances the robustness of the optimization. The coarse reconstruction makes the process less sensitive to local properties and initially prioritizes redundant information at lowest spatial frequencies prior to handling periodic features.",

At a block 902, image data of a chemical sample is received at the system 800, for example from the multi-modal image source 816. That image data may be EDX image data or EELS image data, in accordance with examples. This image data may contain one or more measured chemical maps. The image data at block 902 represents one modality type. At a block 904, image data from another modality type is obtained, in particular annular dark field (ADF) image data corresponding to the chemical sample. In some examples, the image data at block 904 has been simultaneously obtained to the image data at block 902. At a block 906, the image data of block 902 and the image data of block 904 are correlated using an optimization process that performs a minimization between the two image data and one or more recovered chemical maps captured of the sample. For example, the process 906 may correlated and optimize the received first and second image data, from blocks 902 and 904, respectively, by applying any of optimization Ex. 1, Ex. 2, or Ex 3 above. Although, any suitable optimization process that performs a minimization between each of the EDX/EELS image data and the ADF image data and one or more recovered chemical maps of the chemical sample may be used. At block 908, the fused multi-modal electron microscopy generates and/or displays one or more recovered chemical maps, in response to the optimization process of block 906. For example, the block 908 may generate recovered EDX or EELS maps of individual chemical constituents or an overlay, as shown in various examples herein including in FIGS. 1-3."

For example, we applied the present techniques to demonstrate fused multi-modal tomography on a simulated composite material system (see, FIG. 8A) formed of three elements (Ni, Co and O). The process virtually eliminated Poisson noise in the raw chemical tomograms (FIG. 8C) and efficiently recovered interior nanoparticles in the fused multi-modal reconstruction (as shown in FIG. 8D). Conventionally spectral maps were collected at every tilt; however we used a new sampling strategy that efficiently minimized dose by maintaining an asymmetric ratio (e.g. 1:5) between the number of ADF and chemical images (FIG. 1D). Although sparse chemical measurements are severely underdetermined in Fourier space (FIG. 1C), fusing the two modalities ultimately filled in missing information (FIG. 1D), improving resolution and reconstruction quality.",
                                "Further, we experimentally demonstrated fused multi-modal electron tomography on ZnS/CuS nanocrystals. The radiation sensitivity of the 20 nm nanoparticles makes it challenging to map the distribution ZnS and CuS rich phases in 3D. Despite the noisy EELS maps, the recovered chemical tomograms quality was substantially improved (FIGS. 9B and 9C) over traditional tomography as \u02dc5-10 nm internal cavities and oxidized shells are clearly visible (FIG. 9A). These results demonstrate fused multi-modal tomography can substantially improve the quality and accuracy of chemical tomograms, even under minimal doses (e.g., \u02dc104 e/\u212b2).",

At a block 1002, image data of a chemical sample is received at the system 800, for example from the multi-modal image source 816. That image data may be EDX image data or EELS image data. The image data at block 1002 may be collected at a specified rotation angle of the chemical sample. The image data at block 1002 contains a stack the multi-modal image data from source 816 corresponding to multiple discrete rotation angles of the specimen. At a block 1004, image data from another modality type is obtained, in annular detector (e.g., ADF or ABF) image data corresponding to the chemical sample. The image data at block 1004 may be simultaneously obtained to the image data at block 902. The image data at block 1002 contains a stack ADF image data for multiple discrete rotation angles of the specimen. Via a block 1005, the process of block 1004 and/or 1002 is repeated as the sample is incrementally rotated within the electron microscope across a range of sample angles. At a block 1006, the image data of block 1002 and the image data of block 1004 are provided to an optimization process that performs a minimization between the two image data and one or more recovered volumetric chemical maps are captured of the sample. In particular, the first image data and the second image data from all sample rotation angles are correlated using an optimization process that performs a minimization between the first and second image data under projection matrix operators defined by the range of sample angles. For example, the process 1006 may apply the minimization of Ex. 4 as the optimization process. At block 1008, the fused multi-modal electron microscopy generates and/or displays a 3D recovered chemical tomogram. For example, the block 1008 may generate a fused multi-modal chemical 3D tomogram as shown in FIG. 9B of the fused slice images of FIG. 9C.",
