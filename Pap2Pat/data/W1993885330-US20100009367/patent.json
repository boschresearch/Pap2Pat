Micro RNAs alleles associated with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were identified and ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified.

                        "The present invention relates generally to neurological and psychiatric diseases diagnosed by and/or caused in whole or in part by microRNAs and, more specifically, to the use of individual microRNAs for the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",
                        "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disease. Approximately one percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime\u2014more than two million Americans suffer from the illness in a given year. Schizophrenia typically presents in early adulthood or late adolescence. The illness is characterized by positive symptoms (delusions or hallucinations), negative symptoms (blunted emotions and lack of interest) and disorganized symptoms (confused thinking and speech or disorganized behavior and perception). Additionally, cognitive deficits are also frequently observed, particularly in elderly schizophrenia patients. For some patients, the disorder is life-long, while others may have periodic episodes of psychosis. Men have an earlier age of onset than women, and also tend to experience a more serious form of the illness with more negative symptoms, poorer chances of a full recovery, and a generally worse outcome [Jablensky, 2000]. Systematic reviews show that schizophrenia is 1.4 times more likely to occur in men than in women.",
                        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level [Ambros, 2003; Lai, 2003; Bartel, 2004]. In animals, miRNAs bind to complementary sites in target mRNAs 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) to create imperfectly paired RNA heteroduplexes that inhibit translation of the target RNAs. Many microRNAs are conserved in sequence and function between distantly related organisms.",
                        "miRNAs regulate various biological functions including developmental processes, developmental timing, cell proliferation, neuronal gene expression and cell fate [Klein et al., 2005], apoptosis [reviewed in [Mattick and Makunin, 2005; Croce and Calin, 2005], tissue growth, viral pathogenesis, brain morphogenesis [Giraldez et al., 2005], muscle differentiation [Naguibneva et al., 2006], stem cell division [Hatfield et al., 2005] and progression of human diseases [Ambros, 2003; Palatnik et al., 2003]. Condition-specific, time-specific, and individual-specific levels of gene expression may be due to the interactions of different miRNAs accounting for more accurate genetic expression of various traits [Ying and Lin, 2004].",
                        "The large number of miRNA genes, the diverse expression patterns and the abundance of potential miRNA targets suggest that miRNAs may be a significant but unrecognized source of human genetic disease, including neuropsychiatric disorders. A sequence variant in the binding site for the miRNA miR-189 in the SLITRK1 mRNA has been shown to be associated with Tourette's syndrome [Abelson et al., 2005]. In addition, components required for miRNA processing and/or function have also been implicated in fragile X mental retardation [Jin et al., 2004], DiGeorge syndrome [Landthaler et al., 2004] and cancer [Karube et al., 2005], pointing to the wide ranging involvement of miRNAs in disease.",
                        "A number of animal models have been developed for schizophrenia, utilizing both non-primate (rat) and primate (monkey) animals. In one commonly used animal model of schizophrenia, phencyclidene (PCP) is chronically administered to the animal subjects, resulting in dysfunctions similar to those seen in schizophrenic humans (Jentsch et al., 1997, Science 277:953 955; Piercey et al., 1988, Life Sci. 43(4):375 385).",
                        "The causes of schizophrenia are essentially unknown. Although it is believed to have a genetic component, environmental factors appear to influence the onset and severity of the disease. Neuropathological changes in schizophrenics may include enlargement of the lateral ventricles, cavities in the brain which are part of the cerebrospinal fluid system. Sometimes, there is a decrease in overall brain mass. Several different theories have been developed regarding the etiology of schizophrenia, including the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic theories of schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis posits that positive symptoms result from excess function of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the mesolimbic area of the brain. This hypothesis is based largely on indirect, pharmacological evidence that (1) dopamine-antagonizing drugs are effective antipsychotic agents; (2) dopamine-mimicking drug exacerbate schizophrenic symptoms and (3) certain symptoms of acute paranoid schizophrenia can be elicited in non-schizophrenics by amphetamine, a drug that activates dopamine systems. However, negative symptoms have been associated with regionally localized dopamine deficits in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, there is a need for a more effective diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Additionally, there is a need for an earlier detection method for schizophrenia, such as prior to the presentation or onset of noticeable symptoms. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well."

                        "The present invention relates to the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in development, onset and expression of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and using the understanding of such miRNA expression and activity to diagnose and treat schizophrenia or to diagnose risk of developing schizophrenia and the development of functional assays to assist the search for schizophrenia therapies.",
                        "A first aspect is a method of diagnosing schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in an individual by determining the presence of a variant of a miRNA gene or allele. The miRNA may be any miRNA known or found to affect or influence schizophrenia and such activity may be determined via the functional assay described herein, which was used to determine the function of miRNAs disclosed here, or by another method that allows determination of the function of miRNA as it relates to schizophrenia. The miRNAs may be one or a combination of more than one of the following: miRNA alleles consisting of let-7f-2, mir-18b, mir-505, mir-502, mir-188, mir-325, mir-660, mir-509-3, mir-510, mir-421, mir-934, and mir-450a-2.",

Certain variants that the present invention has determined influence on schizophrenia are let-7f-2, mir-18b, mir-505, mir-502, mir-188, mir-325, mir-660, mir-509-3, mir-510, mir-421, mir-934, and mir-450a-2. The biological samples may be any sample from a subject containing mRNA, including blood, serum, plasma, saliva, urine, or tissue samples. The mRNA is isolated using any method, including the method using RNA STAT-60 described herein. The presence of RNA may be determined via any reliable method, including the use of Northern blots.",
                        "The term \u201cmiRNA\u201d includes miRNA molecules, variants, and analogs thereof, miRNA precursor molecules, and DNA molecules encoding miRNA or miRNA precursor molecules.",
                        "Further, therapeutic applications of the miRNA described herein may be used as modulators or targets of schizophrenia and related spectrum disorders. In general, the nucleic acid molecules may be used as a modulator of the expression of genes which are at least partially complementary to said nucleic acid and are sufficient to agonize or antagonize the activity as desired. miRNA may be used as raw materials for the manufacture of sequence-modified miRNA molecules to adjust target specificity or target binding efficacy. miRNA may also be used in an attempt to alter a differentiated cell line back into a stem cell or another cell type to avoid the onset or symptoms of schizophrenia. For therapeutic applications, miRNA may be administered alone or as part of a composition, which comprises the miRNA (or different miRNAs) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The therapeutic methods may be carried out by known methods, wherein a nucleic acid is introduced into a desired target cell in vitro or in vivo using gene transfer techniques include calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, electroporation, microinjection, viral vectors, and commercial liposomes. The composition may be in any suitable form such as an injectable solution, a cream, ointment, tablet, suspension, or pill and may be administered in any therapeutically effective manner, such as parenterally, intravenously, orally, or nasally.",
                        "Methods of screening and tests for the bioactivity of a miRNA are disclosed. The test determines altered functionality of a miRNA gene or allele variant. The test uses functionality activity comparisons. In one embodiment, polyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts, termed \u201cprimary miRNAs\u201d (pri-miRNA) is and variant or putative variant miRNA is isolated. Then, the pri-miRNA and variant miRNA are co-transfected with an si target and an mi target. Preferably, each target has its own reporter. Then, the functionality of the variant is determined using miRNA and siRNA assays. Changes in the level of expected repression of the si and mi reporters (either reduced or enhanced repression) in transient transfection assays indicates altered functionality of the miRNA gene or allele variant. The variants may be the result of one or more of a SNP, point mutation, deletion, insertion, frameshift, or translocation. The screen may be used to test whether the miRNA variant indicates predisposition to or incidence of schizophrenia.",
                        "For the methods of diagnosing, assessing susceptibility, and/or treating schizophrenia involving the identification and/or observation of microRNAs (miRNA) and preferably, variant miRNA are provided and identified as follows: Individual microRNAs (miRNAs) effect moderate down-regulation of gene expression, typically by two- to four-fold. Micro RNAs alleles associated with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were identified. The miRNA genes were amplified in patients and controls. Ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified in distinct miRNA genes in males with schizophrenia and one ultra-rare variant was identified in a control sample (8/193 versus 1/191, p=0.019). These variants were not found in an additional 7,197 control X-chromosomes. Functional analyses of ectopically expressed copies of the variant miRNA precursors demonstrate loss of function, gain of function and altered expression levels. The present invention also provides methods for selecting a preferred therapy for a particular subject or group of subjects or individuals at risk for or suffering from schizophrenia or psychosis by use of miRNAs.",
                        "miRNA genes are scattered among all the chromosomes in humans except for the Y chromosome. They primarily derive from intronic or exonic capped, polyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts, termed \u201cprimary miRNAs\u201d (pri-miRNA). It is estimated that approximately one-third of human protein coding genes are post-transcriptionally controlled by miRNAs. The mature miRNAs are used to guide miRNA-induced silencing complex (\u201cRISC\u201d) to the complementary sequences in the 3\u2032UTR of targeted transcripts. The result is site specific mRNA cleavage when the pairing is nearly complete (mostly in plants, rare in animals) or translational inhibition when imperfect base-pairing occurs (mostly in animals).",
                        "Translational suppression and mRNA degradation, modes by which mammalian miRNAs regulate gene expression, do not require complete complementarity between the miRNA and target. All that is required to reduce protein levels of the target is Watson-Crick base pairing between seven consecutive nucleotides in the target mRNAs 3\u2032 UTR and nucleotides 2-7 or 2-8 (the \u201cseed sequence\u201d) at the miRNA's 5\u2032 end. The critical role played by the \u201cseed sequence\u201d in the majority of miRNA/mRNA interactions implies that a single nucleotide change in the seed sequence, or shift of the processing sites during biogenesis of the miRNA/miRNA* duplex could result in a novel miRNA with alternated target-spectra. Therefore, both the 5\u2032end of the mature miRNA that is generated from the 5\u2032 arm of the pre-miRNA (5p) by Drosha, and the 5\u2032 end of the mature miRNA that is produced by Dicer from the 3\u2032 arm of the premiRNA (3p), will be under strong selective pressure to be highly conserved. (Drosha is an RNase III enzyme that initiates miRNA processing. Dicer is an RNase III endoribonuclease that cleaves miRNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA)). The sequence preceding the 5\u2032 end or trailing the 3\u2032 end of the pre-miRNAs form an \u02dc11 bp long imperfect stem which is recognized by DGCR-8 as part the required structure for Drosha cutting. For most miRNAs/target combinations, a single nucleotide change in the seed sequence or any base shift during the Drosha/DGCR8 or Dicer/TRBP processing step can result in altered function or creation of a novel miRNA. The terminal loop is also important for Dicer/TRBP complex binding as well as for other protein binding. Sequences outside the seed in the mature miRNA sequence can also impact the strength of inhibition as well as the spectra of targeted transcripts.",
                        "Mature miRNAs are generated by a two-step processing mechanism (FIG. 1). PrimiRNAs are first processed to \u201chairpin-like\u201d partially duplexed precursor miRNAs (premiRNA) in the nucleus. Aside from a small group of pre-miRNAs that are generated through mRNA splicing/debranching machinery termed the \u201cmiRtron pathway\u201d, most pre-miRNAs are processed from pri-miRNAs by the nuclear RNase (ribonuclease) III Drosha which partners with the RNA binding protein DGCR8 (the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8). Pre-miRNAs are typically 55-80 nt in length and are exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5/RAN-GTP. The pre-miRNAs are processed into \u02dc21-22 nt long miRNA/miRNA* duplexes by RNase III Dicer, which partners with the RNA binding protein TRBP (TAR RNA binding protein). The production of miRNA/miRNA* duplexes is an essential step in miRNA biogenesis and precisely defines the ends of the mature miRNAs for preferential loading of the guide strand. The choice of the guide strand is dependent in part on the thermodynamic end properties of the duplex, with the least thermodynamically stable 5\u2032 end usually being chosen as the guide strand while the other strand, labeled miRNA*, is usually degraded. Most recently, the fates of the miRNA guide and miRNA* strands have been shown to be tissue dependent with both strands being functionally active under specific conditions. Argonaute-mediated loading into the processing complex can increase the bias of strand loading, and RNA binding proteins can selectively block the processing of primiRNAs.",
                        "The mature miRNAs are incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains at least Dicer, TRBP and Ago2 [Hammond et al., 2000; Mourelatos et al., 2002; Hutvagner and Zamore, 2002]. In RISC, miRNAs can mediate down regulation of target gene activity by translational inhibition in animals [Zeng et al., 2002]. RISC can cleave, degrade or suppress translation of target mRNAs depending on the position and extent of the complementarity between miRNAs and target mRNAs. Given the complexity of protein interactions and the number of processing steps required to produce a functional miRNA, point mutations affecting any of these steps could dramatically impact the downstream function of these miRNAs.",
                        "The hairpin structure guided miRNA processing, the thermodynamic influences on strand loading, and the base pairing requirements for miRNA/mRNA interaction indicate that single nucleotide polymorphisms (\u201cSNPs\u201d) in miRNA genes affect miRNA biogenesis and function. Similarly, SNPs in the miRNA target also affect miRNA function. To clarify possible confusions in terminology with respect to SNPs, the terms \u201cmiR-SNP\u201d refers to the variation that occurs in the miRNA gene sequence, and \u201cmiR-TS-SNP\u201d refers to SNPs that occur in the miRNA target site (TS) or binding site. Since one miRNA can have multiple targets, miR-SNPs would exhibit more profound and broader biological effects than miR-TS-SNPs.",
                        "The roles that sequences flanking the pre-miRNA play in miRNA processing has been thoroughly studied. MiR-SNPs in miR-125a and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus encoded miR-K5 impaired miRNA processing by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex. MiR-196a2-SNP (rs11614913) in the mature miR-196a2 was associated with a significantly decreased rate of survival in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer, and an association of rs11614913 with enhanced processing of mature miR-196a. MiR-146a-SNP (rs2910164) within the pre-miR-146a sequence reduced both the amount of pre- and mature miR-146a, and affected the Drosha/DGCR8 processing step. MiR-196a2-SNP, miR-146a-SNP, miR-149-SNP (rs2292832) and miR-499-SNP (rs3746444) are each associated with increased breast cancer risk. MiR-146a-SNP was associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, breast/ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Each of the above are examples of SNPs created by changes in DNA coding sequences, but miRNAs can also be post transcriptionally modified, such as by RNA editing via ADAR. A to I edited pre-miR-151 blocks its processing by Dicer/TRBP. ADAR edited pri-miR-142 was more easily degraded by Tudor-SN. Edited miR-376a-5p within the middle of the \u201cseed\u201d region alters the set of targets regulated by this miRNA. A survey of RNA editing of miRNAs from ten human tissues implies RNA editing of miRNA happens quite often and it is a mechanism to increase the diversity of miRNAs and their targets.",
                        "Mutant or post transcriptionally edited miRNAs can result in alterations of processing and function. Hence, SNPs that occur in sequences downstream or upstream of the pre-miRNA, sequences in the terminal loop of premiRNA, and sequences in the miRNA and miRNA* duplexes may also play important roles in miRNA biogenesis and function (FIG. 1).",
                        "In the present experiments, X-linked miRNA genes from patients with diagnosed schizophrenia or autism were analyzed and compared with a gene pool analysis consisting of over 7,000 chromosomes from normal individuals (i.e., individuals without schizophrenia or autism). Twenty-four different point mutations have been determined in either the mature miRNA sequences or the precursor regions for sixteen different X-linked miRNA genes. The present invention addresses the effects on miRNA generation and function generated by SNPs in X-linked miRNAs.",
                        "Of the tested miRNA-SNPs, one variant results in elevated levels of the mature miRNA sequence relative to the wild type, several variants result in reduced levels of the mature miRNA sequence relative to wild type, and another variant results in the generation of a novel miRNA due to an alteration in the Drosha and/or Dicer processing sites. This latter miRNA-SNP also has an alteration the strand loading bias relative to the wild type version. A single base alteration even outside of the mature miRNA sequence can have profound consequences on miRNA generation and function.",
                        "Most miR-SNPs are located in clusters and some of them, such as mir-510 and miR-509, rapidly evolved in primates. Table 4 shows variants with 509-2 and Table 5 shows variants without 509-2. One clear example is the generation of miR-509-3-5p by the deletion of an \u2018A\u2019 from miR-509-5p, which is processed from miR-509-1 or 2 (FIG. 2; SEQ ID NOS: 1-43). There are three copies of miR-509, miR-509-1 and miR-509-2 that produce the same mature miRNAs, while miR-509-3 produces a different 5p product. Most likely, the miR-509-3-5p was created by the deletion of an \u2018A\u2019 from miR-509-5p. A high percentage of an ATG insertion was also observed in the 5\u2032 end of miR-509-1-3p. This insertion may affect both 5p and 3p processing. Eventually, under the selective pressure to target different mRNAs or to target with different specificities, the three copies of miR-509 may have developed into different family members with the same seed, like the let-7 family, or different miRNAs in the same cluster, like the miR-25-93-106b cluster. The miR-509 structure is more flexible, as there are no significant differences in the processing or function among three different miR-509-3 variants (FIG. 3, SEQ ID NOS: 44-47).",
                        "Many factors contribute to differences in miRNA expression profiles, including transcriptional regulation, post transcriptional miRNA processing, the stability of the pri-miRNA or pre-miRNA, and pre-miRNA export. The existence of miRNA targets may also result in miRNA stabilization because of engagement in miRISC. Different miRNA profiles are a consequence of subtle genetic changes in pre-miRNAs and their immediate flanking sequences.",
                        "Previous in silico studies from Bentwitck and Zhang show that miRNA family expansion during primate evolution may have occurred through tandem duplications. Copy number variations and high rates of gene conversion in the newly emerged miRNAs in primates may have resulted in production of novel miRNAs with more specialized functions. As a result, gene conversion may be a major mechanism in the biogenesis of miRNAs during evolution, especially in clusters of miRNAs, homologues, or miRNA families. Finally, some of the SNPs characterized by altered processing or abundance may play significant roles in disease development and progression.",

                        "Genomic sequence information of DNAs derived from patients diagnosed with schizophrenia was compared to that of large sets of normal patient samples. In certain experiments, the comparison focused on X-linked genes in male patients. From these analyses, several mutations in microRNA precursor and mature coding sequences were identified, some of which exhibit functional impairments in our cell culture based testing system. miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) containing stem-loop or \u201chairpin\u201d structures \u02dc60 nt in length.",

These variants were not found in additional 7,197 control X-chromosome alleles using gene pool analyses. Functional analyses indicated that some of these variants display altered regulatory function consistent with dominant inheritance. The altered functions or defects in processing of the pre-miRNAs in the mutant alleles detected in our analyses indicate that these microRNAs may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. It is relevant to note that each microRNA can potentially regulate dozens, and perhaps even hundreds of different transcripts during development, so even subtle defects in activity can have profound effects on development of the nervous system.",
                        "Identified targets of the miRNAs in which ultra-rare variants were found are listed in Table 6. Such targets include neuregulin 1 (NGR1), Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4). Defects in miRNAs altering the interactions between miRNAs and their mRNA targets thus likely contribute to schizophrenia.",
                        "To explore the role of miRNAs in schizophrenia, 59 microRNA genes on the X chromosome were analyzed in 193 males with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The miRNA genes were amplified in patients and controls. Ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified in distinct miRNA genes in males with schizophrenia and one ultra-rare variant was identified in a control sample (8/193 versus 1/191, p=0.019). These variants were not found in an additional 7,197 control X-chromosomes. Functional analyses of ectopically expressed copies of the variant miRNA precursors demonstrate loss of function, gain of function and altered expression levels. These results provide the first statistically significant data linking microRNA gene dysfunction with schizophrenia."

Variant miR-934-T/G occurs at the first nucleotide of the miR-934-5p (FIG. 2), which is also the Drosha processing site. Because the variant occurs at the 5\u2032 end and the base of the 5\u2032end plays an important role in strand selection into miRISC, the T/G transversion of this variant is particularly significant. Transfection and Northern blot results show that this SNP affects the production of both strands (FIG. 10, SEQ ID NOS: 88-95).",
                                "First, the transfection assay shows that repression of the 5p reporter is reduced by the SNP, and Northern blots confirmed the reporter assay results (FIG. 10A). Second, the length of the 5p product seems to be increased in the Northern blot. The most dramatic changes are in the 3p product. Transfections show that repression of the 3p reporter by the SNP is increased, and Northern blots show that the variant produces more 3p than wild type. Thus, the guide strand and passenger strand in miRISC are inverted in the wild type versus mutant miRNAs. Cloning also yielded more 5p wild type clones and more mutant 3p clones. The cloning data also show that the production of 3p is altered, with both the Drosha and Dicer cutting sites being offset by one nucleotide from the wild type, resulting in a different 3p product. This not only produced a novel miRNA, but it also affected the strand selection in miR-934/miR-934*. The wild type miR-934-5p starts with a U and is most likely selected as the predominant guide strand due to the lower thermodynamic stability of the 5\u2032 end. The U/G transversion changes the first nucleotide of the 5p product to \u2018G\u2019, which affected the Dicer cutting site, moving it back one nucleotide from the original \u2018G\u2019 to an \u2018A\u2019. Thus the 3p product in the mutant has a lower 5\u2032 end thermodynamic stability and this is probably responsible for altered guide strand selectivity, which is consistent with the reported requirements for asymmetric strand loading.",

        "3. The method of claim 2, wherein the diagnosis determines the presence of more than one variant of miRNA that indicates schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.",
        "4. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the presence of a variant of a miRNA gene or allele comprises:\na) isolating miRNA from a sample taken from an individual; and\nb) comparing the miRNA from the individual to known variants of miRNA, which variants indicate schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.",
        "5. A method of determining an increased risk for a schizophrenia or propensity thereto in a subject comprising the steps of:\na) analyzing the miRNA in a sample obtained from the subject; and\nb) determining the presence of a variant of the miRNA wherein the presence of said variant is indicative of an increased risk for developing schizophrenia or propensity thereto in the subject.",
        "6. The method of claim 5, wherein the miRNA is selected from the group consisting of let-7f-2, mir-18b, mir-505, mir-502, mir-188, mir-325, mir-660, mir-509-3, mir-510, mir-421, mir-934, mir-890, mir-892, and mir-450a-2.",
        "7. A method of determining altered functionality of a miRNA gene or allele variant, comprising:\na) isolating pri-miRNA and variant miRNA;\nb) co-transfecting pri-miRNA and variant miRNA with a corresponding si target and a corresponding mi target with reporters;\nc) determining whether the variant has altered function of the target by running both miRNA and siRNA assays, wherein\nreduced or enhanced repression of the si and mi reporters in transient transfection assays indicates altered functionality of the miRNA gene or allele variant.",
        "8. The method of claim 7, wherein the variant is a point mutation.",
        "9. The method of claim 7, wherein the variant is a deletion, insertion, or translocation.",
        "10. The method of claim 7, wherein the miRNA gene or allele variant indicates the condition of schizophrenia."
