# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce schizophrenia
- motivate miRNA role in diagnosis and treatment

## SUMMARY

- summarize embodiments of diagnosis and treatment methods

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce miRNA involvement in schizophrenia
- describe method of diagnosing schizophrenia using miRNA gene variants
- explain therapeutic applications of miRNAs in schizophrenia treatment
- outline method of screening for bioactivity of miRNA variants
- describe miRNA biogenesis and function
- discuss impact of SNPs on miRNA biogenesis and function
- present results of experiments analyzing X-linked miRNA genes in patients with schizophrenia
- identify ultra-rare variants in miRNA genes associated with schizophrenia
- discuss implications of miRNA gene dysfunction in schizophrenia development

### Examples

- define patient and control populations
- describe PCR amplification and sequencing
- outline gene pool analysis and cell-based miRNA processing test
- detail RNA isolation, northern blot, mature miRNA cloning, and dot-blotting

### Results

- analyze microRNA genes on X chromosome
- identify ultra-rare variants in precursor or mature miRNA
- evaluate functional consequences of point mutations
- develop novel assay to monitor processing and function of miRNAs
- analyze effects of SNPs on miRNA processing and function
- discuss implications of results for miRNA biology and disease
