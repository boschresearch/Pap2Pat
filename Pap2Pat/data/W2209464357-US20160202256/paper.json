    "title": "A general strategy to construct small molecule biosensors in eukaryotes",
    "date": "2015-12-29",
    "abstract": "Biosensors for small molecules can be used in applications that range from metabolic engineering to orthogonal control of transcription. Here, we produce biosensors based on a ligand-binding domain (LBD) by using a method that, in principle, can be applied to any target molecule. The LBD is fused to either a fluorescent protein or a transcriptional activator and is destabilized by mutation such that the fusion accumulates only in cells containing the target ligand. We illustrate the power of this method by developing biosensors for digoxin and progesterone. Addition of ligand to yeast, mammalian, or plant cells expressing a biosensor activates transcription with a dynamic range of up to ~100-fold. We use the biosensors to improve the biotransformation of pregnenolone to progesterone in yeast and to regulate CRISPR activity in mammalian cells. This work provides a general methodology to develop biosensors for a broad range of molecules in eukaryotes.",

                "Biosensors capable of sensing and responding to small molecules in vivo have wide-ranging applications in biological research and biotechnology, including metabolic pathway regulation\u00a0(Zhang et al., 2012), biosynthetic pathway optimization\u00a0(Raman et al., 2014; Tang and Cirino, 2011), metabolite concentration measurement and imaging\u00a0(Paige et al., 2012), environmental toxin detection\u00a0(Gil et al., 2000), and small molecule-triggered therapeutic response\u00a0(Ye et al., 2013). Despite such broad utility, no single strategy for the construction of biosensors has proven sufficiently generalizable to gain widespread use. Current methods typically couple binding of a small molecule to a single output signal, and use a limited repertoire of natural protein-\u00a0(Tang et al., 2013) or nucleic acid aptamer-binding\u00a0(Yang et al., 2013) domains, which narrows the scope of small molecules that can be detected. A general solution to small molecule biosensing should be adaptable to a range of small molecules and responses.",
                "A promising approach to biosensor design in eukaryotes uses conditionally stable ligand-binding domains (LBDs)\u00a0(Banaszynski et al., 2006; Tucker and Fields, 2001). In the absence of a cognate ligand, these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system\u00a0(Egeler et al., 2011). Binding of the ligand stabilizes the LBD and prevents its degradation. Fusing the destabilized LBD to a suitable reporter protein, such as an enzyme, fluorescent protein, or transcription factor, renders the fusion conditionally stable and generates sensor response (Figure 1a). Naturally-occurring LBDs can be engineered to be conditionally stable\u00a0(Banaszynski et al., 2006; Miyazaki et al., 2012; Iwamoto et al., 2010), making it possible in principle to convert them into biosensors for target ligands. Designed LBDs can also be used, especially in cases for which natural binding proteins do not exist or lack sufficient specificity or bioorthogonality.10.7554/eLife.10606.003Figure 1.A general method for construction of biosensors for small molecules.(a)\u00a0Modular biosensor construction from a conditionally destabilized LBD and a genetically fused reporter.

                "Here, we convert a single designed LBD scaffold into multiple highly specific biosensors for the clinically relevant steroids digoxin and progesterone. We engineer LBDs fused with fluorescent reporters to be conditionally stable in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Attaching these conditionally-stabilized LBDs to transcription factors (TFs) yields biosensors that respond to their target ligands with greater signal induction than observed with fusions to fluorescent proteins. We use TF-biosensors to improve the biosynthetic yield of progesterone in yeast. The biosensors retain function when ported directly into mammalian cells, with up to 100-fold activation over background, allowing us to develop a method for tight control of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The biosensors also show up to 50-fold activation by ligand in Arabidopsis thaliana. The method presented here enables the rapid development of eukaryotic biosensors from natural and designed binding domains."

                        "LBDs intended for biosensor development should recognize their targets with high affinity and specificity. We began with the computationally-designed binding domain DIG10.3\u00a0(Tinberg et al., 2013), hereafter DIG0, which binds the plant steroid glycoside digoxin and its aglycone digoxigenin with picomolar affinities. Introduction of three rationally-designed binding site mutations into DIG0 resulted in a progesterone binder (PRO0) with nanomolar affinity\u00a0(Tinberg et al., 2013). We constructed genetic fusions of DIG0 and PRO0 to a yeast-enhanced GFP (yEGFP, LBD-biosensors DIG0-GFP and PRO0-GFP) and constitutively expressed them in S. cerevisiae\u00a0(Supplementary file 1). The fusions showed little change in fluorescence in response to digoxin or progesterone, respectively (Figure 1b,c and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). Work by Wandless and co-workers has shown that mutagenesis of LBDs can be used to identify variants that are stable only in the presence of a target ligand\u00a0(Banaszynski et al., 2006). We randomly mutagenized the LBDs of DIG0-GFP and PRO0-GFP by error-prone PCR and subjected libraries of 105\u00a0(Gil et al., 2000) integrants to multiple rounds of FACS, sorting alternately for high fluorescence in the presence of the ligand and low fluorescence in its absence. We isolated LBD variants having greater than 5-fold activation by cognate ligand (Figure 1b,c and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). By making additional variants that contain only one of the up to four mutations found in the progesterone biosensors, we showed that some mutations are additive, while others predominately contribute to sensitivity (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a). Many of the conditionally-destabilizing mutations identified in DIG0 involve residues that participate in key dimer interface interactions (Figure 1d). The conditionally-destabilizing mutations of PRO0 are located throughout the protein (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013d); the DIG0 interface mutations also rendered PRO0-GFP conditionally stable on binding progesterone (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2e)."

The use of TFs serves to amplify biosensor response and allows for ligand-dependent control of gene expression\u00a0(Shoulders et al., 2013; Beerli et al., 2000; Louvion et al., 1993).

The dynamic range of TF-biosensor activity was maximal when the biosensor was expressed using a weak promoter and weak activation domain, because of lower yEGFP expression in the absence of ligand (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a,b).10.7554/eLife.10606.006Figure 2.Ligand-dependent transcriptional activation.(a)\u00a0TF-biosensor construction from a conditionally destabilized LBD, a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation (TAD) domain.

                        "We chose Gal4-DIG1-VP16 (hereafter G-DIG1-V) for further TF-biosensor development because it has both a large dynamic range and maximal activation by ligand. A FACS-based screen of an error-prone PCR library of G-DIG0-V, G-DIG1-V, and G-DIG2-V variants identified mutations L77F and R60S in the Gal4 dimer interface (hereafter GL77F, GR60S) that further increased TF-biosensor response by lowering background activity in the absence of ligand (Figure 2b and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c). Although these Gal4 mutations were identified by screening the\u00a0libraries of digoxin-dependent TF-biosensors, they also increased progesterone-dependent activation of the G-PRO-V series of biosensors, indicating a shared mechanism of conditional stability in both systems (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d). Combining mutations in Gal4 and DIG0 or PRO0 led to activations of up to 60-fold by cognate ligand, a ten-fold improvement over the most responsive LBD-biosensors (Figure 2c,d and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a) and a dynamic range that has been challenging to achieve with stability-based biosensors in yeast\u00a0(Rakhit et al., 2011). The TF-biosensors were also rapidly activated, showing a five-fold increase in signal after 1 hr of incubation with ligand and full activation after ~14 hr (Figure 2e,f and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b). In contrast to the LBD-biosensors, the TF-biosensors exhibited a broad range of fluorescence levels across single cells, as well as a population of nonfluorescent cells in the presence of ligand (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). We used FACS to isolate cells from the nonfluorescent population and found those cells to be inviable, possibly indicating plasmid loss or toxicity from biosensor activation.",
                        "Upon withdrawal of ligand, strains expressing TF-biosensors rapidly exhibited reduction in signal, reaching half of their maximum yEGFP fluorescence after approximately 5 hr and nearly undetectable fluorescence after 10\u201315 hr (Figure 2g,h). The response of the TF-biosensors to the withdrawal of ligand is likely much faster than observed by fluorescence, as the reduction in fluorescence signal is dependent on both the degradation of the TF-biosensors as well as the degradation and dilution of previously expressed yEGFP."

                        "An attractive feature of the TF-biosensors is that the constituent parts \u2013 the DBD/promoter pair, the LBD, the TAD, the reporter, and the yeast strain \u2013 are modular, such that the system can be modified for additional applications. To demonstrate tunability, we replaced the DBD of G-DIG1-V with the bacterial repressor LexA and replaced the Gal4 DNA-binding sites in the GAL1 promoter with those for LexA. LexA-based TF-biosensors with DIG1 and a weak TAD (B42) showed a strong response to digoxin (nearly 40-fold) only when the promoter-driving reporter expression contained LexA-binding sites (Figure 3a). These results demonstrate that the biosensors can function with different combinations of DBDs and TADs, which could produce diverse behaviors and permit their use in eukaryotes requiring different promoters. Furthermore, the reporter gene can be swapped with an auxotrophic marker gene to enable growth selections. The TF-biosensors drove the\u00a0expression of the HIS3 reporter most effectively when steroid was added to the growth media, as assessed by the\u00a0growth of a histidine auxotrophic strain in media lacking histidine (Figure 3b,d). Fusion of the Mat\u03b12 degron to the biosensor improved dynamic range by reducing the\u00a0growth of yeast in the absence of ligand. Finally, the yeast strain could be modified to improve biosensor sensitivity toward target ligands by the\u00a0deletion of the gene for a multidrug efflux pump\u00a0(Ernst et al., 2005), thereby increasing ligand retention (Figure 3c\u2013d).10.7554/eLife.10606.009Figure 3.Tuning TF-biosensors for different contexts.(a) The TAD and DBD of the TF-biosensor and the corresponding binding site for the DBD in the reporter promoter can be swapped for a different application.

                        "Improving bioproduction requires the ability to detect how modifications to the regulation and composition of production pathways affect product titers. Current product detection methods such as mass spectrometry or colorimetric assays are low-throughput and are not scalable or generalizable. LBD- and TF-biosensors could be coupled with fluorescent reporters to enable high throughput library screening or to selectable genes to permit rapid evolution of biosynthetic pathways\u00a0(Tang and Cirino, 2011; Dietrich et al., 2010; Chou and Keasling, 2013). Yeast-based platforms have been developed for the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically relevant steroids, such as progesterone and hydrocortisone\u00a0(Duport et al., 1998; Szczebara et al., 2003). A key step in the production of both steroids is the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by the enzyme 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD). We aimed to use a progesterone biosensor to detect and improve this transformation. An important feature of biosensors intended for pathway engineering is their ability to detect a product with minimal activation by substrate or other related chemicals. TF-biosensors built from PRO1 showed the greatest dynamic range and selectivity for progesterone over pregnenolone when driving yEGFP expression or when coupled with a HIS3 reporter assay (Figure 4a,b and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a). We investigated whether this sensor could be used to detect the in vivo conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by episomally-expressed 3\u03b2-HSD (Figure 4c). Using GL77F-PRO1-V driving a yEGFP reporter, we could detect progesterone production, with biosensor response greatest when 3\u03b2-HSD was expressed from a high copy number plasmid and from a strong promoter (Figure 4d).10.7554/eLife.10606.010Figure 4.Application of biosensors to metabolic engineering in yeast.(a) Fold activation of GL77F-PRO1-V by a panel of steroids in yEGFP reporter strain PyE1.

To select for improved progesterone production, we required a growth assay in which wild-type 3\u03b2-HSD could no longer complement histidine auxotrophy when the yeast were grown on plates supplemented with pregnenolone. To this end, the selection stringency was tuned by adding the His3 inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1e). We mutagenized the 3\u03b2-HSD coding sequence using error-prone PCR and screened colonies that survived the HIS3 selection for their yEGFP activation by pregnenolone. By transforming evolved 3\u03b2-HSD mutations into a fresh host background, we showed that the mutations in the enzyme, and not off-target plasmid or host escape mutations, were responsible for increased biosensor response (Figure 4e). Two of the mutants, 3\u03b2-HSD N139D and 3\u03b2-HSD F67Y, were assayed for progesterone production using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and were found to produce two-fold more progesterone per OD than cells bearing the wild-type enzyme (Figure 4f)."

If yeast-derived biosensors function in more complex eukaryotes, the design-build-test cycle in those organisms could be rapidly accelerated. We first assessed the portability of yeast TF-biosensors to mammalian cells. Single constructs containing digoxin and progesterone TF-biosensors with the greatest dynamic ranges (without codon optimization) were stably integrated into human K562 cells using PiggyBac transposition. We characterized the dynamics of the TF-biosensors in human cells by dose response and time course assays similar to the yeast experiments (Figure 5a\u2013d). As with yeast, the human cells demonstrated greater sensitivity to digoxin, with fluorescence activation increasing up to 100 nM of cognate ligand for digoxin biosensors and 1 mM for progesterone biosensors. We observed >100-fold activation for the most sensitive progesterone biosensor GL77F-PRO1-V. The increase in mammalian dynamic range over yeast may arise from more aggressive degradation of destabilized biosensors or greater accumulation of target-stabilized biosensors or reporters resulting from larger cell sizes and slower doubling times. The time course data show that fluorescence increased four-fold within 4 hr of target introduction and rose logarithmically for 24\u201348 hr.",

Despite the high programmability and specificity of Cas9-mediated gene editing achieved to date, unchecked Cas9 activity can lead to off-target mutations and cytotoxicity\u00a0(Fu et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013; Pattanayak et al., 2013). Further, it may be desirable to tightly regulate Cas9 activity such that gene editing occurs only under defined conditions. To facilitate inducible gene editing, we fused human codon-optimized versions of the DIG3 and PRO1 LBDs to the N-terminus of Cas9 from S. pyogenes. We integrated this construct into a reporter cell line containing an EGFP variant with a premature stop codon that renders it non-functional. Upon separate stable integration of the DIG-Cas9 and PRO-Cas9 fusions, we transfected a guide RNA targeting the premature stop codon as well as a donor oligonucleotide containing the sequence to restore EGFP activity via homologous recombination. After a 48-hr incubation period, we observed an ~18-fold increase in GFP positive cells with digoxigenin relative to the mock control (Figure 5e).10.7554/eLife.10606.012Figure 5.Activation of biosensors in mammalian cells and regulation of CRISPR/Cas9 activity.(a)\u00a0Concentration dependence of response to digoxin for constructs containing digoxin TF-biosensors and Gal4 UAS-E1b-EGFP reporter individually integrated into K562 cells.

                        "To assess generalizability of these sensors to multicellular organisms, we engineered G-DIG1-V to function as an environmental biosensor in plants. The DIG1 sequence was codon optimized for expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. We tested biosensor fusions to two different degrons, Mat\u03b12 from yeast and DREB2a from Arabidopsis\u00a0(Sakuma et al., 2006), and we used the VP16 and VP64 variants as the TAD. We initially tested the G-DIG1-TAD variants with a transient expression assay using Arabidopsis protoplasts and a reporter gene consisting of firefly luciferase under the control of a Gal4-activated plant promoter (pUAS::Luc). The biosensor containing the Mat\u03b12 degron and VP16 TAD showed the highest fold activation of luciferase in the presence of digoxigenin (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a). We next inserted the genes encoding G-DIG1-V-Mat\u03b12 and the Gal4-activated pUAS::Luc into a plant transformation vector and stably transformed them into Arabidopsis plants. Primary transgenic plants were screened in vivo for digoxigenin-dependent luciferase production, and responsive plants were allowed to set seed for further testing. Second generation transgenic plants (T1, heterozygous) were tested for digoxin- or digoxigenin-dependent induction of luciferase expression. After 42 hr, we observed 30-50-fold induction of luciferase activity in digoxin-treated plants compared to the uninduced control (Figure 6). Both digoxin and digoxigenin were capable of inducing the biosensor. Digoxigenin-dependent luciferase induction was observed in multiple independent transgenic T1 lines (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b), and a rising dose response to digoxigenin was observed in the transgenic plants (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1c). The specificity of the digoxigenin biosensor in plants parallels that in yeast cells (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1d).10.7554/eLife.10606.013Figure 6.Application of biosensors in plants.(a) Activation of luciferase expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the G-DIG1-V biosensor in the absence (left) or presence (right) of 100 \u03bcM digoxin.

                "In vivo biosensors for small molecules enable the regulation and detection of cellular responses to endogenous metabolites and exogenous chemicals. Here, we show that LBDs can be conditionally destabilized to create biosensors that function in yeast, mammalian cells, and plants, and we demonstrate the use of these biosensors in metabolic engineering and genome editing applications. While this method requires a high-affinity ligand-binding domain as a starting point, nearly all small molecules of interest have a natural protein interactor. Furthermore, the use of de novo-designed binders opens the possibility of generating biosensors for ligands with unsuitable or unknown binding proteins. By incorporating standard mutagenesis and screening, our method constitutes a simple platform for sensor development that can be applied to many areas of biotechnology. These sensors act either at the level of post-translational control over protein function or at the level of transcription (Figure 7a), and they can be tuned by altering any of their components (Figure 7b) or by modifying efflux of the target ligand in the host organism. These tunable features should make the biosensors useful in many different cellular and environmental contexts.10.7554/eLife.10606.015Figure 7.Schematic of biosensor platform.(a)\u00a0Biosensors for small molecules are modularly constructed by replacing the LBD with proteins possessing altered substrate preferences. (b) Activity of the biosensor can be tuned by 1) introducing destabilizing mutations (red Xs), 2) adding a degron, 3) altering the strength of the TAD or DNA binding affinity of the TF, 4) changes in the number of TF-binding sites or sequences, and 5) titrating 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of His3. (c) Yeast provide a genetically tractable chassis for biosensor development before implementation in more complex eukaryotes, such as mammalian cells and plants.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10606.015",
                "Our results suggest a general mechanism of conditional stabilization for LBDs, allowing the rational development of biosensors for other targets. Furthermore, the portability of the mutations we identified suggests a structural basis for conferring conditional stability to the DIG0 LBD scaffold. Both the DIG0 LBD and Gal4 are homodimers, and the majority of the conditionally-stabilizing mutations are located at the dimer interfaces. A computational model of the Gal4-DIG0 complex indicates that the orientation of the two domains allows a homodimeric fusion to form (Figure 2b). These results suggest an allosteric interplay between ligand binding and dimer formation: weakening of the dimer interface, in either the DIG0 or the Gal4 domain, is compensated by ligand binding. This LBD scaffold is derived from a member of the nuclear transport factor 2 family, a fold class that typically has a large dimer interface (~1200 \u00c52) that facilitates the large and open ligand-binding site (~600 \u00c52). These protein folds are well suited for de novo design of other LBDs because of their large binding pocket and natural substrate diversity\u00a0(Todd et al., 2002). Exploiting dimer interfaces to modulate stability without impairing ligand binding may be a general mechanism to confer conditional stability on LBDs. This possibility is supported by the observation that interface mutations in DIG0 and Gal4 conferring digoxin-dependent stability lead to progesterone-dependent stability in a progesterone biosensor (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a).",
                "A long-standing challenge in metabolic engineering is to rapidly detect and control how changes to the regulation and composition of biosynthetic pathways affect product titers. Transcriptional control by a product or intermediate\u00a0(Zhang et al., 2012; Raman et al., 2014; Tang and Cirino, 2011) and directed\u00a0evolution of constituent pathway elements\u00a0(Agresti et al., 2010; Alper et al., 2005; Dietrich et al., 2013) have emerged as promising strategies towards this goal. These approaches require high selectivity against intermediates\u00a0(Zhang and Keasling, 2011), a feature demonstrated here that can be explicitly considered during the computational design and screening process. Our method allows biosensors to be generated that are highly selective for a small molecule, facilitating a simple directed evolution strategy without requiring prior structural or bioinformatic knowledge about the targeted enzyme(s) or pathway(s). Because the biosensors are TF-based, sophisticated systems of optimizing metabolic output, such as dynamic control of gene expression\u00a0(Zhang et al., 2012) and feedback-regulated genome evolution\u00a0(Chou and Keasling, 2013), are possible.",
                "A reliance on the general principles of protein stability and ligand binding allows the development of biosensors that function in any organism with similar protein quality control machinery. Here, we engineered biosensors based on a designed scaffold derived from a bacterial protein. These biosensors required only minimal modifications to retain high levels of sensitivity when developed in yeast and deployed across mammalian and plant species, demonstrating unprecedented portability for biosensors. In some cases, these biosensors showed a greater dynamic range in mammalian cells relative to yeast, possibly due to larger cell volume and variations in protein degradation machinery. Further work using biosensors based on multiple different LBD scaffolds and introduced into diverse organisms will allow us to better understand the principles by which biosensor variability across hosts arises.",
                "Small molecule biosensors with the modularity incorporated here enable diverse cellular responses to a variety of exogenous and endogenous signals\u00a0(Banaszynski et al., 2008). Gene editing is an area that requires particularly tight coupling of cell response to activation signals. The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a facile and robust genome-editing platform, but it can result in off-target genetic changes\u00a0(Fu et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013; Pattanayak et al., 2013). Proposed solutions include optimizing guide RNA sequences\u00a0(Fu et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), building chimeric Cas9 fusions requiring the presence of two Cas9 molecules in close proximity\u00a0(Mali et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Guilinger et al., 2014; Ran et al., 2013), and regulating Cas9 activity by chemical or light-based inducers\u00a0(Dow et al., 2015; Zetsche et al., 2015; Polstein and Gersbach, 2015). While small molecule inducers including doxycycline and rapamycin have been used, these molecules may confer leaky expression and cytotoxicity\u00a0(Xie et al., 2008). Thus, an expanded chemical repertoire is needed for tightly regulated gene editing and gene therapy applications. By exploiting the low background of the LBD-biosensors, we produced biosensor-Cas9 fusions with tightly controlled activation (Figure 5e). This switch-like control over CRISPR/Cas9 activity could reduce background activity and off-target editing, a critical feature for safer gene therapies\u00a0(Mandal, et al., 2014;\u00a0Wu et al., 2013; Schwank et al., 2013).",
                "Our biosensor design approach should have numerous applications in agriculture. For example, biosensors could be developed to enable plants to monitor the environment for pollutants, toxins or dangerous compounds. Coupling biosensors with a phytoremediation trait could enable plants to both sense a contaminant and activate a bioremediation gene circuit. When paired with an agronomic or biofuel trait, such biosensors could serve as triggers for bioproduction. In the transgenic Arabidopsis plants, we observed ligand-dependent activation in all cells, tissues and organs examined (Figure 6).",
                "The technology introduced here operates at either the transcriptional or post-translational level. These biosensors can be developed in yeast and readily transferred with minimal modification to other eukaryotic cell types, where they retain a high level of sensitivity (Figure 7c). The generality of our approach arises from the universality of the transcriptional activation and protein degradation machinery across eukaryotes, together with the modularity and tunability of the constituent parts. These biosensors should find broad application, including improving metabolically engineered pathway flux and product titers, exerting ligand-dependent control over genome editing, and detecting exogenous small molecules or endogenous metabolites."

The reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR (95\u00b0C 30 s, 61\u00b0C 30 s, 72\u00b0C 80 s). Template plasmid was digested by adding 1 \u03bcL of DpnI to the reaction mixture and incubating for 3 hr at 37\u00b0C. Resulting PCR product was purified using a Quiagen PCR cleanup kit, and a second round of PCR was used to amplify enough DNA for transformation. Gene product was amplified by combining 100 ng of mutated template DNA with 2.5 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM primers (GDV_ePCR_fwd and GDV_ePRC_rev), 10 \u03bcL of 5X Phusion buffer HF, 1.5 \u03bcL of DMSO, and 1 \u03bcL of Phusion high-fidelity polymerase (NEB, Waltham, MA) in 50 \u03bcL. Product was assembled by 30 cycles of PCR (98\u00b0C 10 s, 65\u00b0C 30 s, 72\u00b0C 35 s). Following confirmation of a single band at the correct molecular weight by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was purified using a Quaigen PCR cleanup kit and eluted in ddH2O.

Forty-eight hours later, cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and the percentage of EGFP positive cells was determined."

                        "Digoxin transcriptional activators were initially tested in a transient expression assay using Arabidopsis protoplasts according previously described methods(Yoo et al., 2007), with some modifications. Briefly, protoplasts were prepared from 6-week old Arabidopsis leaves excised from plants grown in short days. Cellulase Onozuka R-10 and Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Inc., Japan) in buffered solution were used to remove the cell wall. After two washes in W5 solution, protoplasts were re-suspended in MMg solution at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/mL for transformation. Approximately 104 protoplasts were mixed with 5 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA and PEG4000 at a final concentration of 20%, and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The transformation reaction was stopped by the\u00a0addition of two volumes of W5 solution, and after centrifugation, protoplasts were re-suspended in 200 \u03bcL of WI solution (at 5 \u00d7 105/mL) and plated in a 96-well plate. Digoxigenin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the wells, and protoplasts were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark, with slight shaking (40 rpm). For luciferase imaging, protoplasts were lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and mixed with LARII substrate (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega,\u00a0Madison,\u00a0WI). Luciferase luminescence was collected by a Stanford Photonics XR/MEGA-10 ICCD Camera and quantified using Piper Control (v.2.6.17) software."

                        "G-DIG1-V was recoded to function as a ligand-dependent transcriptional activator in plants. Specifically, an Arabidopsis thaliana codon optimized protein degradation sequence from the yeast MAT\u03b12 gene was fused in frame in between the Gal4 DBD and the DIG1 LBD. The resulting gene sequence was codon-optimized for optimal expression in Arabidopsis thaliana plants and cloned downstream of a plant-functional CaMV35S promoter to drive constitutive expression in plants, and upstream of the octopine synthase (ocs) transcriptional terminator sequence. To quantify the transcriptional activation function of DIG10.3, the luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis (firefly) was placed downstream of a synthetic plant promoter consisting of five tandem copies of a Gal4 Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS) fused to the minimal (-46) CaMV35S promoter sequence. Transcription of luciferase is terminated by the E9 terminator sequence. These sequences were cloned into a pJ204 plasmid and used for transient expression assays in Arabidopsis protoplasts."
