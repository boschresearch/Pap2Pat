                        "Acoustic telemetry involves acoustic devices (or tags) commonly used to monitor behavior of fish. Acoustic tags transmit a sound signal that transmits identification, location, and other information about a tagged fish to a receiver at a selected pulse rate interval (PRI), or \u201cping\u201d rate. The receiver detects signals emitted by the acoustic tag and converts the sound signals into digital data. Post-processing software then processes the digital data and provides location information about the tag and thus the behavior of the fish when the receiver detects the sound signal. By identifying the signature of the acoustic signal a specific animal may be identified, which allows tracking the behavior of the host. Acoustic data may be used, e.g., to estimate survival of fish through dams and other routes of passage. However, conventional transmitters are too large for small hosts (30-100 g mass and 180-270 mm length), have short lifetimes, and/or have an inadequate transmission range that to date have precluded intensive research of small hosts such as juvenile sturgeon using acoustic telemetry techniques. Recently, an injectable acoustic tag was developed for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for tracking juvenile salmon detailed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/014,035 filed 29 Aug. 2013, and other acoustic tags for tracking other small hosts detailed in Patent Application No.: PCT/US14/53578 filed 29 Aug. 2014, which references are incorporated herein in their entirety. The injectable acoustic tag works well for tracking yearling Chinook salmon in river systems. However, it is not optimal for long-term monitoring of hosts requiring a stronger acoustic signal and longer service life including, e.g., juvenile (<1 year old) sturgeon. Accordingly, new tag designs are needed that reduce the overall size, mass, and/or volume, that enhance the power source voltage, tag lifetimes, and transmission range, and reduce adverse effects and costs associated with attachment (which includes implantation) thus broadening the range of potential applications including, e.g., investigating behavior and habitat of juvenile sturgeon and other small species. The present invention addresses these needs."

The acoustic tag may include a power source that delivers a power source voltage to power a tag circuit. The tag circuit may deliver a selected voltage to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) that transmits an acoustic transmission signal at a signal intensity selected between about 159 dB and about 163 dB. The tag may be configured to provide a selectable tag lifetime at the selected signal intensity of at least about 98 days at a pulse rate interval of about 5 seconds.",

The method may include delivering a selected voltage from a tag circuit powered by a power source to PZT in the acoustic transmission (tag) device. The tag device may be attached to the selected host. The tag circuit may generate an acoustic transmission signal in the PZT at a selected signal intensity over a selectable tag lifetime. Signal intensity may be selected between about 159 dB and about 163 dB.",

This configuration allows a higher peak-to-peak voltage from the tag circuit to be delivered across the PZT than would normally be delivered to the PZT. In some embodiments, the two analog switches may be directly coupled to the PZT, which permits the voltage from the tag circuit to be directly applied to the PZT.",

One output voltage may be a higher voltage (e.g., about +7 volts) than the power source voltage. The other output voltage may be a lower voltage (e.g., about \u22123 volts) than the power source voltage. The dual boost converter sub-circuit may share a single inductor to reduce the size of the tag.",

In the exemplary embodiment, when the two voltage potentials delivered by the dual boost converter sub-circuit alternate between about +7 volts and about \u22123 volts, the voltage delivered from the tag circuit to the PZT may be about 20 volts (peak-to-peak).",
