    "abstract": "Omalizumab is a widely used therapeutic anti-IgE antibody. Here we report the crystal structure of the omalizumab\u2013Fab in complex with an IgE-Fc fragment. This structure reveals the mechanism of omalizumab-mediated inhibition of IgE interactions with both high- and low-affinity IgE receptors, and explains why omalizumab selectively binds free IgE. The structure of the complex also provides mechanistic insight into a class of disruptive IgE inhibitors that accelerate the dissociation of the high-affinity IgE receptor from IgE. We use this structural data to generate a mutant IgE-Fc fragment that is resistant to omalizumab binding. Treatment with this omalizumab-resistant IgE-Fc fragment, in combination with omalizumab, promotes the exchange of cell-bound full-length IgE with omalizumab-resistant IgE-Fc fragments on human basophils. This combination treatment also blocks basophil activation more efficiently than either agent alone, providing a novel approach to probe regulatory mechanisms underlying IgE hypersensitivity with implications for therapeutic interventions.",

                        "We previously described an IgE-Fc3\u20134 mutant (IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134), which contains an engineered disulfide bond at position 335 that traps the IgE-Fc3\u20134 domain in a closed conformation with reduced conformational flexibility33 (Fig. 1b). This variant retains high-affinity binding to omalizumab, but not Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Employing this restrained IgE-Fc3\u20134 variant, we crystallized the IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134:omalizumab\u2013Fab complex (subsequently referred to as the IgE:omalizumab complex). The purified complex (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) crystalized in the P21 space group, diffracted X-rays to 2.5\u2009\u00c5 (Table 1), and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the existing IgE\u2013G335C\u2013Fc3\u20134 (ref. 33) and omalizumab\u2013Fab structures34. The asymmetric unit contains two copies of IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134, and four copies of the omalizumab\u2013Fab, providing four copies of the IgE:omalizumab interface related by non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). Side-chain electron density was well resolved throughout the IgE:omalizumab interface (Supplementary Fig. 3c).",
                        "Analysis of the structure revealed that the omalizumab\u2013Fab approaches perpendicularly to the IgE C\u025b3 domain, in contrast to recently proposed models35, and contacts symmetric binding sites on the face of the two C\u025b3 domains of the IgE dimer (Fig. 2a\u2013c). These contacts are predominantly formed between the omalizumab\u2013Fab and C\u025b3 \u03b2-sheet residues below the Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding loops (FG, BC and DE; Fig. 2d). Structural alignment of the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complex5 with the IgE:omalizumab complex shows that the binding loops are only slightly perturbed within the IgE:omalizumab complex at receptor site 2 (Fig. 2d); thus, omalizumab does not appear to inhibit IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 interactions by distorting the Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding site. Instead, the omalizumab\u2013Fab is positioned between the binding sites of both Fc\u025bRI and CD23, blocking interactions with both receptors, with the heavy chain proximal to the CD23 site, and the light chain proximal to the Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding sites (Fig. 2d). Of note, both the position of the omalizumab epitope on the face of C\u025b3, and the perpendicular binding orientation of the omalizumab Fab, suggest that omalizumab could approach and target a preformed IgE\u2013Fc\u025bRI complex."

                        "We previously demonstrated that omalizumab can bind preformed IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes, but not full-length IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes25. Therefore, we hypothesized that the C\u025b2 domains of full-length IgE in the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complex obscure an omalizumab-binding site that is exposed in the IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complex. As predicted, alignment of the structures of IgE:omalizumab and IgE-Fc2-4:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes demonstrates that the C\u025b2 domains overlap extensively with an otherwise exposed omalizumab-binding epitope in the IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 structure (Fig. 2e). Therefore, omalizumab's specificity for free IgE is not solely determined by Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 competition, but also by IgE-conformation-dependent masking of its own second omalizumab epitope. These observations suggest that fragmented IgE molecules lacking C\u025b2 could be aggregated by omalizumab, leading to basophil activation (Supplementary Fig. 4); however, we have not observed this in human basophils or mast cells25.",
                        "Given that the crystal structure lacks the C\u025b2 domain, it cannot account for possible contributions of the C\u025b2 to omalizumab:IgE interactions. Therefore, we also compared the binding kinetics of full-length IgE (clone Sus11) to that of the IgE-Fc3\u20134 fragments. We hypothesized that the ka of full-length IgE might be slower than that of IgE-Fc3\u20134 because the C\u025b2 domains obscure one of the two symmetric omalizumab epitopes (Fig. 1), and, as expected, the ka of full-length IgE was 15\u201330-fold lower as compared with the IgE-Fc3\u20134 fragments tested (Supplementary Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the kd of the full-length IgE was also 4.5\u201310.9-fold slower than any of the three IgE-Fc3\u20134 fragments tested (Supplementary Fig. 1). This results in only minor differences in the overall equilibrium Kd (\u223c3.5-fold) between intact IgE and the IgE-Fc3\u20134 fragments.",
                        "The IgE C\u025b3 domains also show significant conformational flexibility, adopting closed and open states relative to the C\u025b4 domains that are associated with CD23 and Fc\u025bRI binding, respectively. The potential impact of these conformational changes on omalizumab binding has not been fully assessed. The localization of the omalizumab epitope on the face of the C\u025b3 domain suggested that omalizumab would interact equally well with both open and closed forms of the IgE-Fc. To examine this possibility, we compared the binding kinetics of omalizumab with wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134, the IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134 mutant (locked in the closed conformational state33) and with IgE-Fc3\u20134 bound to Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (stabilized in the open state by receptor binding). IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134 exhibited similar kinetics in omalizumab-binding studies as wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 (Supplementary Fig. 1) but was unable to bind Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggest that omalizumab can bind closed conformations of IgE efficiently, and indicate that the crystal structure reflects the normal binding mode of omalizumab for IgE-Fc3\u20134.",
                        "No mutations have been identified that stabilize the open IgE-Fc3\u20134 conformational state, making studies of the omalizumab interaction with this state more challenging. However, omalizumab binds to IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes25, and our structural analysis demonstrates that one of the two C\u025b3 domain epitopes is fully accessible to omalizumab. Therefore, to examine the potential impact of the open C\u025b3 domain conformation on omalizumab binding, we measured the kinetics of omalizumab binding to preformed IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes. This analysis revealed an association rate constant (ka) for omalizumab with IgE-Fc3\u20134 bound to Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes that was closer to full-length IgE alone and slower than unbound IgE-Fc3\u20134. The similarity in association rates between full-length IgE and IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes may be in part because of the fact that each binding partner contains a single exposed C\u025b3 domain (Supplementary Fig. 5). The dissociation rate constant (kd) for the omalizumab:IgE-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes was also similar to that of the measured rates for IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 or omalizumab:IgE complexes (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), consistent with the dissociation of either of these two interfaces during measurement.",
                        "Together, these kinetic data demonstrate that the IgE-Fc C\u025b3 conformations have little or no impact on omalizumab binding and that, in free IgE, the C\u025b2 domain may alter the kinetics of omalizumab binding with a small effect on the affinity of the interaction. These data support the structural observation that omalizumab:IgE interactions are primarily mediated by a stable epitope contained in the C\u025b3 domain. These kinetic data also highlight the critical role of the C\u025b2 domains in the intact receptor-bound IgE, which are required to mask an omalizumab epitope that is not directly blocked by the Fc\u025bRI itself."

                        "To establish which residues fall within the omalizumab epitope on IgE, we analysed the interfaces of the omalizumab:IgE complex with PISA36. All NCS copies shared the majority of contacts, which extend along the length of the C\u025b3 domain, involve 23 IgE residues and bury \u223c725\u2009\u00c52 of surface area on IgE (Fig. 3a). Previously identified IgE mutants that inhibit omalizumab binding, studied in an intact IgE heavy chain, correspond well with the binding interface observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 3b) (ref. 24). After correcting for different numbering schemes and IgE sequences from prior studies (Supplementary Fig. 6), all residues implicated in omalizumab:IgE binding are within the predicted omalizumab:IgE interface, and many participate in hydrogen bonds (R376, S378, K380, Q417) or salt bridges (R419) predicted by the crystal structure (Fig. 3c\u2013e). Notably, IgE E414, a residue implicated in omalizumab-binding studies with the mutants E414R/Q, appears to form an intrachain salt bridge with IgE R376 (Fig. 3d) and may be essential for stabilizing the conformation of the adjacent omalizumab-binding residues (Fig. 3d,e).",
                        "The omalizumab complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, with the exception of the light chain CDR3 loop, contact IgE. CDR residues previously shown to be required for omalizumab binding either contact IgE (light chain D32 in CDR1 (Fig. 3c) and heavy chain H101 in CDR3 (Fig. 3e)) or form interactions with neighbouring CDR loops (heavy chain CDR3 H105 and H107) (ref. 24). The complex contains five hydrogen bonds distributed throughout the omalizumab:IgE interface and two salt bridges between light chain residues D32 and D34 and IgE R419 (Fig. 3c\u2013e). The heavy chain CDR3, which shows the most extensive conformational change from the unbound omalizumab:Fab structure (PDB ID: 4X7S), also contains three aromatic side chains that contact IgE (Y102, H101, F103; Fig. 3e). Outside of the omalizumab heavy chain CDR3, four additional aromatic side chains contact IgE: Y33 in the heavy chain CDR1, Y36 in the light chain CDR1 and Y53 and Y57 in the light chain CDR1. Therefore, it appears that a network of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and extensive hydrophobic interactions facilitate omalizumab:IgE interactions.",
                        "The IgE residues interacting with omalizumab CDRs are largely distinct from those that engage Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (ref. 24). IgE residues P426 and R427 are the only minor overlapping portions of the omalizumab:IgE-Fc3\u20134 and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1:IgE-Fc3\u20134 interfaces as calculated with the PISA analysis (Fig. 3a). Each residue is unique to site 2 of the Fc\u025bRI\u03b1:IgE complex. The residues are adjacent to the omalizumab light chain framework region (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7) and are peripheral to the omalizumab:IgE interface. Only one NCS-related IgE chain has well-resolved electron density for R427, while the remaining copies do not (Supplementary Fig. 7). Within this chain neither R427 nor P426 make contacts (<4\u2009\u00c5) directly with omalizumab; however, R427 indirectly interacts with the light chain framework through a sulfate ion (Supplementary Fig. 7). Mutations at R427 (R427E) lead to a minor reduction in omalizumab binding (25\u201356%), suggesting that this residue can affect omalizumab:IgE interactions24. In contrast, the R427E mutation substantially reduced Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 binding to IgE, while another mutant series that contained a R427A mutation only partially reduced Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 binding37. Although omalizumab may directly compete with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 for IgE residues, the extent of direct competition and binding site overlap involves at most two amino acids."

                        "Omalizumab inhibition of Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 and CD23 binding could arise from contributions of multiple structural mechanisms, including direct competition for receptor-binding residues on IgE, steric clashes caused by physical overlap of omalizumab and IgE receptors and potential omalizumab-induced conformational changes in IgE. The kinetic and structural data suggest that omalizumab does not induce conformational changes in Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding loops or in the relative positions of the C\u025b3 domains that could affect receptor binding. Omalizumab also shows minimal overlap with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding residues; however, physical overlap between the bound omalizumab Fab and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 could be substantial and critical to omalizumab activity.",
                        "To gain quantitative insight into the contribution of inhibitor overlap in blocking IgE interactions with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 and CD23, we calculated the theoretical volumes of atomic overlap between omalizumab and its two IgE receptors. First, we performed a structural alignment of the C\u025b3 domain of the IgE:omalizumab complex with the C\u025b3 domain of the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complex at sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 4a). This alignment strategy accounts for the variability of open and closed IgE conformations observed across IgE crystal structures143338. We then calculated the volume of atomic overlap between the superimposed omalizumab and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 proteins. This analysis revealed that, for the omalizumab-binding site proximal to Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 binding site 2, there are significant steric clashes between the antibody light chain and both domains of the Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 receptor (Fig. 4a), while no clashes exist at site 1. These structural data indicate that omalizumab's mechanism of Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 inhibition involves substantial steric conflict with the receptor at site 2, while direct competition for Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding residues is limited.",
                        "Omalizumab has also been shown to inhibit the binding of CD23 (ref. 39). Both substantial steric overlap between omalizumab and CD23, and direct competition for IgE-binding residues by the omalizumab heavy chain, contribute to omalizumab inhibition of CD23 binding (Fig. 4b,c). The degree of steric overlap of omalizumab with CD23 is significantly greater than that observed for Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (Fig. 4b). Binding-site comparisons also demonstrate a more extensive overlap between IgE residues that engage omalizumab and CD23 in their respective complexes as compared with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (Fig. 4c)."

                        "We recently described a class of IgE inhibitors derived from Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) libraries, capable of disrupting IgE:Fc\u025bRI complexes2325. These agents target preformed IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes found on mast cells and basophils and accelerate the dissociation rate constant to release free IgE. The activated release of IgE on the surface of effector cells might prove beneficial in treating acute allergic reactions and enhance the clearance of allergen-specific IgE during anti-IgE therapy by targeting both cellular and serum pools of IgE simultaneously. We have demonstrated that a bivalent DARPin (bi53_79) containing a non-competitive IgE-binding domain and a disruptive competitor domain dissociates complexes with greater efficiency in vitro and shows greater potency than omalizumab in blocking passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice bearing the human Fc\u025bRI receptor25. To our surprise, we also observed that omalizumab is not strictly a competitive inhibitor of IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 interactions, but at higher concentrations it is also capable of targeting and disrupting IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes25. We have published the crystal structure of the DARPin-based inhibitor E2_79 (ref. 23), which is able to accelerate the dissociation of Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes at concentrations \u223c3,000 \u00d7 above the E2_79:IgE KD (ref. 23). In contrast, omalizumab shows an ability to disrupt preformed Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes at concentrations that are much higher (\u223c1,000,000-fold greater) than the omalizumab:IgE KD (ref. 25), indicating that it is much less efficient at the process of binding to and dissociating these preformed complexes. We hypothesized that this difference in disruptive capability was related to the binding-site locations for E2_79 and omalizumab on IgE and the level of atomic overlap between each inhibitor and receptor. We therefore compared the structure of both the E2_79:IgE-G335C-Fc3\u20134 complex (E2_79:IgE) and the omalizumab:IgE complex.",
                        "The structure of the E2_79:IgE complex demonstrated that the E2_79-binding sites do not overlap with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding residues, while omalizumab exhibits only minor peripheral interactions with two Fc\u025bRI\u03b1-binding residues23. Instead, similar to omalizumab, E2_79 exhibited steric conflicts with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 in aligned structures of the complexes. Given that both agents can disrupt preformed IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes25, we sought to quantitatively compare their relevant steric clashes with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 when bound to IgE, by computing the predicted volume of atom\u2013atom overlap of each inhibitor with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 in aligned complex structures. This analysis reveals that omalizumab has roughly three times the volume of atomic overlap with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 compared with E2_79 (omalizumab and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1=1,183\u2009\u00c53 versus E2_79 and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1=401\u2009\u00c53). The omalizumab steric conflicts extend along the length of the omalizumab light chain and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 N-terminal domain, while the E2_79 steric conflicts are more localized near the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 interface (Fig. 4a-4d) (ref. 40). Since the E2_79 and omalizumab-binding sites are substantially overlapping on the IgE-Fc (Supplementary Fig. 8), this large difference in steric overlap with Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 stands out as a prominent structural feature that correlates with the relative disruptive activities of these inhibitors. Conformational dynamics in the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complex may transiently allow E2_79 association and subsequent acceleration of Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 dissociation23. Given the significantly larger region of steric conflicts observed between omalizumab and Fc\u025bRI\u03b1, conformational states of the IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 that could accommodate omalizumab association may simply be less accessible and/or occur with lower frequency, explaining its lower activity. A significant fraction of the steric clashes with both inhibitors occur between the protein backbone of omalizumab or E2_79 and carbohydrate groups on Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 (Fig. 4e). These carbohydrate groups likely explore a wider range of conformations, and may help facilitate the association of these inhibitors to preformed IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes."

IgE residue R419 lies at the interface of the IgE:omalizumab complex, forming contacts with both light and heavy chain CDR loops (Fig. 3c) and participating in salt bridges. Mutation of R419 to an asparagine (R419N) introduces the glycosylation consensus sequence\u2014asparagine valine threonine (NVT) (Fig. 5a).

The IgE-Fc3\u20134 contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, N371 and N394 (refs 41, 42). We have found in recombinant preparations of IgE-Fc3\u20134 that glycosylation at N371 is heterogeneous and leads to a minor band in purified material (Fig. 5b). Both major and minor species of IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 remain in similar proportions to wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 species, with similar mobility shifts in SDS\u2013PAGE. Furthermore, the shift in apparent mass for IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 relative to wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 was lost on digestion with PNGaseF, confirming that it is caused by N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 5b). This additional glycosylation in the middle of the omalizumab epitope completely abolishes omalizumab binding, but only slightly perturbs IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 binding to Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Fig. 5c,d and summary data Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).

                        "The paradigm of using anti-IgE treatment to deplete free IgE (both allergic and non-allergic species) has proven successful for controlling allergic diseases. During omalizumab therapy, omalizumab neutralizes free serum IgE and slowly decreases surface levels of IgE on allergic effector cells. Therefore, it is impossible to simultaneously replace depleted allergen-reactive species with benign IgE species because of the requirement for continued excess omalizumab to be present during treatment. Since IgE-dependent homeostatic regulatory pathways could potentially counteract anti-IgE therapies, we sought to explore the possibility of replacing rather than removing patient IgE. We hypothesized that omalizumab-resistant IgE variants or fragments could be used in combination with omalizumab to effectively exchange the native IgE on human cells bearing Fc\u025bRI or CD23.",
                        "Over the course of omalizumab treatment, free IgE levels and IgE surface levels on basophils decline relatively rapidly within days43, while mast cell IgE levels persist for significantly longer44. The rapid decline of basophil-associated IgE may in part be driven kinetically by basophil turnover in vivo45. However, within the experimental timeframe for our ex vivo experiments with human whole blood (24\u201348\u2009h), we did not observe significant loss of cell surface IgE at doses corresponding to the mean omalizumab serum concentrations from clinical trials46. Therefore, we employed supraphysiologic doses of omalizumab (25\u2009\u03bcM) to enhance the removal of IgE as described previously25. These doses were used here to accelerate the loss of cell-bound IgE to facilitate these exchange experiments. Nonetheless, lower therapeutic doses of omalizumab are sufficient to capture free IgE and reduce cell surface levels of IgE over time, which is the basis of omalizumab's therapeutic effect.",
                        "To track the addition, removal and exchange of IgE species, we employed biotinylated IgE-Fc3\u20134 or omalizumab-resistant IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134, and the JW8 human/mouse chimeric IgE (composed of a human IgE heavy chain and a mouse-\u03bb-light chain). The JW8 mouse-\u03bb-light chain allowed us to track IgE reloading on stripped basophils in parallel with the biotinylated IgE-Fc3\u20134 proteins. We ensured that all antibody reagents used in staining carried the mouse-\u03ba-light chain, or were rat antibodies, to avoid nonspecific binding from the anti-mouse-\u03bb-light-chain antibody used to track JW8-IgE.",
                        "We isolated blood from three donors, and depleted surface IgE on basophils by treating each sample with the disruptive inhibitor E2_79 (Fig. 6a, gating scheme Supplementary Fig. 9). We then reloaded the cells with JW8-IgE (Fig. 6a), while also verifying that stripped cells could be reloaded with biotinylated IgE-Fc3\u20134 or IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 species (Fig. 6a). Therefore, we could remove native IgE species, reload cells with homogeneous traceable IgE and subsequently track the removal or exchange of JW8-IgE (Fig. 6b,c). The \u03bb-light-chain-specific staining of JW8 and biotin-specific staining of the IgE-Fc3\u20134 variants distinguished human basophils that had no JW8-IgE or biotinylated-IgE-Fc3\u20134, a mix of both species, or a single IgE species (Fig. 6b,c).",
                        "Overnight omalizumab treatment of cells that had been homogenously reloaded with JW8-IgE completely removed the JW8-IgE from the cell surface, as shown by an overlay of the pre- and post-treatment flow cytometry profiles (arrow, Fig. 6d). Co-administration of IgE-Fc3\u20134 and omalizumab also showed complete depletion of JW8-IgE species but no exchange for IgE-Fc3\u20134 at 1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 IgE doses (Fig. 6d). In contrast, co-administration of omalizumab-resistant IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 with omalizumab depleted JW8-IgE surface levels, and facilitated IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 reloading to levels observed in IgE-stripped basophils treated with IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 alone (Fig. 6d). Therefore, co-administration of omalizumab and IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 effectively exchanges the receptor-bound IgE on human basophils for IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 ex vivo. Even when wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 doses far beyond physiologic IgE levels were employed (10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121), only minimal reloading of wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 was observed, in contrast to the dramatic reloading of IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 (Supplementary Fig. 10). This effect was not restricted to Fc\u025bRI-expressing basophils. CD23+ B-cells treated with omalizumab and IgE-Fc3\u20134 variants retained surface IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134, but were stripped of wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Furthermore, both wild-type IgE-Fc3\u20134 and IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 occupancy of the CD23 receptor stabilized surface CD23 and increased CD23 surface levels (Supplementary Fig. 11c). Importantly, IgE-mediated stabilization of surface CD23 prevents the release of soluble CD23 (sCD23), a soluble mediator shown to upregulate IgE expression832."

                        "To determine whether IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 could enhance the effect of omalizumab treatment in human cells, we performed basophil-activation tests. Basophils were isolated from healthy donors, treated with DARPins to remove surface IgE (using the enhanced bi53_79 DARPin25) and reloaded with the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-specific JW8-IgE. The resultant NP-reactive basophils were then left untreated or were treated with omalizumab (at therapeutic concentrations of 500\u2009nM), IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 or combinations of both agents for 3 (Fig. 7a) or 6 days (Fig. 7b) before NP-antigen challenge. Given that IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes dissociate slowly, and omalizumab is a weak disruptive inhibitor at the therapeutically relevant concentration used, we did not anticipate a rapid response in basophils homogenously reloaded with JW8-IgE. Accordingly, after 3 days, there were no significant reductions in basophil responses as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 7a). Of note, omalizumab transiently increased basophil sensitivity on day 3, although this effect was overcome by day 6, presumably as omalizumab neutralized a greater fraction of JW8-IgE previously bound to cells. Although this effect was not significant, it does fit with clinical studies, which suggest that basophil sensitivity is increased on a per IgE basis during omalizumab therapy30. There was significantly less activation in cells treated with a combination of omalizumab and IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 (100\u2009nM) as compared with omalizumab alone by day 3 (Fig. 7a), suggesting that combination therapy could offset this transient effect in omalizumab-treated samples. By day 6, a significant reduction in basophil activation was observed in all treatment arms as compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 7b). This result was surprising, given that IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 alone was able to inhibit basophil reactivity at 1\u2009nM concentrations (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, in combination with omalizumab, 1\u2009nM IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 almost completely inhibited basophil activation (Fig. 7b). The additive effect of omalizumab (500\u2009nM) and IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 (1\u2009nM) should be minor if each agent acted only as a competitive inhibitor for JW8-IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 interactions, suggesting that these agents can act synergistically to block basophil activation."

                "Anti-IgE therapy remains an important tool for the management of allergic disorders, and novel second-generation anti-IgE therapies will soon join omalizumab. Yet, the aetiology of allergic disorders is complex and optimal therapeutic responses will likely come from treatment regimens that target and modulate multiple immunological processes.",
                "Here we have clarified the structural basis for omalizumab-mediated inhibition of IgE binding to both Fc\u025bRI and CD23. This analysis revealed similarities between the disruptive inhibitor E2_79 and omalizumab, and provides a mechanistic framework to develop antibody-based therapies that can accelerate the dissociation of IgE:Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 complexes. Such agents could rapidly disarm basophils and mast cells, allowing them to achieve a therapeutic effect faster.",
                "We have also demonstrated that mutant IgE fragments, in conjunction with omalizumab treatment, can exchange native IgE on human cells for IgE fragments, maintaining the occupancy of both high- and low-affinity IgE receptors. We pursued this approach, given the experimental evidence that basophils increase in sensitivity on a per IgE basis during omalizumab treatment282930, and that IgE production can be regulated by IgE:CD23 signalling811123132. These observations raise significant questions about the impact of therapeutic IgE depletion, and suggest that homeostatic responses to the loss of IgE could offset or constrain the therapeutic benefit of anti-IgE treatment. Our experimental observations provide a system to test some of these regulatory pathways and could potentially be used as an adjunct therapy with omalizumab. To this end, we have also demonstrated that IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 can act synergistically with omalizumab ex vivo at very low doses to inhibit basophil activation. This finding suggests that simultaneously targeting Fc\u025bRI and IgE with competitive inhibitors could enhance therapeutic responses. Prior studies have demonstrated that non-activating ligands can antagonize Fc\u025bRI responses to activating ligands by sequestering receptor-proximal signalling components47, and it is possible that IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134:Fc\u025bRI complexes could suppress activation through such mechanisms, in addition to competing for receptor occupancy. Sustained Fc\u025bRI receptor occupancy could also suppress homeostatic responses to the loss of IgE on omalizumab-treated basophils.",
                "Finally, the dissociation of allergen-specific IgE on mast cells located in peripheral tissues is slow, and the effectiveness of anti-IgE within these compartments is poorly understood44. Given that the Fc\u025bRI on mast cells has been shown to drive IgE tissue localization48, co-administration of omalizumab and omalizumab-resistant IgE fragments that bind Fc\u025bRI may enhance the exchange of allergen-specific IgE in peripheral sites, and contribute to the therapeutic benefit of anti-IgE treatment.",
                "Despite the potential utility of IgE exchange, and promising ex vivo results, the concept is far from clinical application. Unexpected antibody responses to the R419N IgE, although unlikely, could prevent the development of any universally benign IgE variant for exchange therapy, and could induce anaphylactic antibody responses to receptor-bound IgE fragments. Yet, our approach with IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 does have two distinct advantages in this regard. First, N-linked glycosylation events are effective at masking antibody epitopes, and could reduce the immunogenicity of IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 (ref. 49). Second, the new antigenic surface generated by truncating IgE to the C\u025b3-4 domains would be largely inaccessible once bound to Fc\u025bRI\u03b1, preventing any antibody responses to this epitope from crosslinking receptor-bound IgE fragments. Given that anti-IgE and anti-Fc\u025bRI\u03b1 antibody responses are relatively common, and are not always pathological50, it is possible that such an approach could be well tolerated."

Purified primary human basophils were seeded at 0.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well in a 96-well plate in 50\u2009\u03bcl of RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100\u2009IU\u2009ml\u22121 penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin (medium). Cells were kept in a cell incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. For desensitization, cells were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM disruptive anti-IgE inhibitor bi53_79 for 8\u2009h in the presence of 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhIL-3 and subsequently washed three times with 150\u2009\u03bcl PBS to remove dissociated IgE and anti-IgE inhibitor from the supernatant. For resensitization, cells were incubated with 100\u2009nM JW8-IgE (NBS-C BioScience, Vienna, Austria) for 2\u2009h in the presence of 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhIL-3. Subsequently, cells were washed two times with 150\u2009\u03bcl PBS and treated with omalizumab, IgE-R419N-Fc3\u20134 or a combination of these molecules for 3 or 6 days at the indicated concentrations. For determination of basophil activation, cells were stimulated with 1\u20131,000\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 NIP(7)BSA (BioSearch Technologies, Petaluma, USA) in the presence of 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhIL-3 for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells were stained with 10\u2009\u03bcl anti-CD63 FITC anti-CCR3-PE staining mix (FK-CCR Flow CAST B\u00fchlmann Laboratories AG, Sch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland) for 20\u2009min at room temperature. At least 3 \u00d7 103 basophils were acquired on a FACSCalibur device. Data were analysed with the FlowJo V10 software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR)."
