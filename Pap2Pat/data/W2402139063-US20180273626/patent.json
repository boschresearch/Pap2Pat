                        "Allergic diseases represent an overreaction of the immune system to normally benign environmental substances, such as dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold, and the incidence of allergies worldwide is rising at an alarming rate (Gould et al. (2008) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 8:205-217); Okada et al. (2010) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 160:1-9). IgE antibodies are central to most allergic reactions, and bind to high affinity receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) present on mast cells and basophils, sensitizing these cells to respond to allergens. Fc\u03b5RI is expressed as a trimer with one \u03b1-chain and two \u03b3-chains or as a tetramer with an additional \u03b2-chain (Galli et al. (2012) Nat. Med. 18:693-704). The Fc\u03b5RI \u03b1-chain (Fc\u03b5RIa) binds IgE with sub-nanomolar affinity (Blank et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:2639-2646; Garman et al. (2000) Nature 406:259-266), and cells expressing Fc\u03b5RI circulate with preloaded IgE, poised for activation. A second IgE receptor (CD23) is expressed on additional cells, including B lymphocytes, where it is thought to play a role in IgE-mediated antigen presentation and feedback regulation of IgE antibody production (Yu et al. (1994) Nature 369:753-756; Getahun et al. (2005) J. Immunol. 175:1473-1482; Cooper et al. (2012) J. Immunol. 188:3199-3207; Heyman et al. (1993) Eur. J. Immunol. 23:1739-1742).",
                        "IgE has been a target for therapeutic development because of its central role in the allergic response. The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab is currently indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Omalizumab has demonstrated robust clinical efficacy (Busse et al. (2001) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 108:184-190; Braunstahl et al. (2013) Resp. Med. 107:1141-1151; Saini et al. (2015) J. Invest. Dermatol. 135:925), and has promise for a wide range of other allergic conditions, including oral food allergen desensitization regimens (Nadeau et al. (2012) Immunol. Allergy Clin. North Am. 32:111-133). Omalizumab acts primarily by neutralizing free serum IgE and gradually reducing surface levels of IgE on Fc\u03b5RI expressing cells, including mast cells and basophils (Sherr et al. (1989) J. Immunol. 142:481-489). Following the omalizumab-dependent decline in surface-bound and free IgE, cell surface levels of Fc\u03b5RI also fall (Bonnefoy et al. (1995) Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 107:40-42; Holdom et al. (2011) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 18:571-576) and blood basophils up-regulate Syk expression and show enhanced sensitivity to anti-IgE stimulation (Dhaliwal et al. (2012) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109:12686-12691). However, beyond these phenomena, it is not fully understood how this dramatic drop in free IgE levels perturbs homeostatic mechanisms responsible for regulating IgE production or allergic responses. Preliminary studies suggest that IgE is able to reciprocally regulate its own production through CD23 in mice and humans (Yu et al., supra; Cooper et al., supra), yet it is not clear what role this plays in humans in vivo. Furthermore, it is not clear if the decline in Fc\u03b5RI expression and up-regulation of Syk in basophils is ultimately helpful, or detrimental, to omalizumab's therapeutic effect.",
                        "We recently described a novel class of IgE inhibitors, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins), capable of disrupting IgE:Fc\u03b5RI complexes (Wurzburg et al. (2000) Immunity 13:375-385; Busse et al. (2001) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 108:184-190). These agents target preformed IgE:Fc\u03b5RIa complexes found on mast cells and basophils and accelerate the dissociation rate constant to release free IgE. The activated release of IgE on the surface of effector cells might prove beneficial in treating acute allergic reactions and enhance the clearance of allergen-specific IgE during anti-IgE therapy. We have demonstrated that a bivalent DARPin (bi53_79) containing a non-competitive IgE binding domain and a disruptive competitor domain, dissociates complexes with greater efficiency in vitro and shows greater potency in blocking passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice bearing the human Fc\u03b5RI receptor (Wurzburg et al., supra). We also observed that omalizumab was not strictly a competitive inhibitor of IgE:Fc\u03b5RIa interactions, but was capable of targeting and disrupting IgE:Fc\u03b5RIa complexes (Wurzburg et al., supra). The mechanism for this disruptive inhibition is incompletely understood, but we have hypothesized that the degree of structural overlap between anti-IgE inhibitors and Fc\u03b5RIa in their respective complexes with IgE is a key parameter governing the efficiency of accelerating complex dissociation.",

                                "As explained above, analogs generally include substitutions that are conservative in nature, i.e., those substitutions that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Specifically, amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic\u2014aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic\u2014lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar\u2014alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar\u2014glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine threonine, tyrosine. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified as aromatic amino acids. For example, it is reasonably predictable that an isolated replacement of leucine with isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar conservative replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid, will not have a major effect on the biological activity. For example, the polypeptide of interest may include up to about 5-10 conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, or even up to about 15-25 conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, or any integer between 5-25, so long as the desired function of the molecule remains intact. One of skill in the art may readily determine regions of the molecule of interest that can tolerate change by reference to Hopp/Woods and Kyte-Doolittle plots, well known in the art.",
                                "By \u201cderivative\u201d is intended any suitable modification of the native polypeptide of interest, of a fragment of the native polypeptide, or of their respective analogs, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, polymer conjugation (such as with polyethylene glycol), or other addition of foreign moieties, as long as the desired biological activity of the native polypeptide is retained. Methods for making polypeptide fragments, analogs, and derivatives are generally available in the art.",
                                "By \u201cfragment\u201d is intended a molecule consisting of only a part of the intact full-length sequence and structure. The fragment can include a C-terminal deletion an N-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion of the native polypeptide. Active fragments of a particular protein will generally include at least about 5-10 contiguous amino acid residues of the full-length molecule, preferably at least about 15-25 contiguous amino acid residues of the full-length molecule, and most preferably at least about 20-50 or more contiguous amino acid residues of the full-length molecule, or any integer between 5 amino acids and the full-length sequence, provided that the fragment in question retains biological activity, such as IgE activity, as defined herein.",
                                "\u201cSubstantially purified\u201d generally refers to isolation of a substance (compound, polynucleotide, protein, polypeptide, polypeptide composition) such that the substance comprises the majority percent of the sample in which it resides. Typically in a sample a substantially purified component comprises 50%, preferably 80%-85%, more preferably 90-95% of the sample. Techniques for purifying polynucleotides and polypeptides of interest are well-known in the art and include, for example, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and sedimentation according to density.",
                                "By \u201cisolated\u201d is meant, when referring to a polypeptide, that the indicated molecule is separate and discrete from the whole organism with which the molecule is found in nature or is present in the substantial absence of other biological macro-molecules of the same type. The term \u201cisolated\u201d with respect to a polynucleotide is a nucleic acid molecule devoid, in whole or part, of sequences normally associated with it in nature; or a sequence, as it exists in nature, but having heterologous sequences in association therewith; or a molecule disassociated from the chromosome.",
                                "\u201cHomology\u201d refers to the percent identity between two polynucleotide or two polypeptide molecules. Two nucleic acid, or two polypeptide sequences are \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d to each other when the sequences exhibit at least about 50%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%-85%, preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95%-98% sequence identity over a defined length of the molecules. As used herein, substantially homologous also refers to sequences showing complete identity to the specified sequence.",
                                "In general, \u201cidentity\u201d refers to an exact nucleotide-to-nucleotide or amino acid-to-amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences, respectively. Percent identity can be determined by a direct comparison of the sequence information between two molecules (the reference sequence and a sequence with unknown % identity to the reference sequence) by aligning the sequences, counting the exact number of matches between the two aligned sequences, dividing by the length of the reference sequence, and multiplying the result by 100. Readily available computer programs can be used to aid in the analysis, such as ALIGN, Dayhoff, M. O. in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure M. O. Dayhoff ed., 5 Suppl. 3:353-358, National biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C., which adapts the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Advances in Appl. Math. 2:482-489, 1981 for peptide analysis. Programs for determining nucleotide sequence identity are available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.) for example, the BESTFIT, FASTA and GAP programs, which also rely on the Smith and Waterman algorithm. These programs are readily utilized with the default parameters recommended by the manufacturer and described in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package referred to above. For example, percent identity of a particular nucleotide sequence to a reference sequence can be determined using the homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman with a default scoring table and a gap penalty of six nucleotide positions.",
                                "Another method of establishing percent identity in the context of the present invention is to use the MPSRCH package of programs copyrighted by the University of Edinburgh, developed by John F. Collins and Shane S. Sturrok, and distributed by IntelliGenetics, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.). From this suite of packages the Smith-Waterman algorithm can be employed where default parameters are used for the scoring table (for example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of one, and a gap of six). From the data generated the \u201cMatch\u201d value reflects \u201csequence identity.\u201d Other suitable programs for calculating the percent identity or similarity between sequences are generally known in the art, for example, another alignment program is BLAST, used with default parameters. For example, BLASTN and BLASTP can be used using the following default parameters: genetic code=standard; filter=none; strand=both; cutoff=60; expect=10; Matrix=BLOSUM62; Descriptions=50 sequences; sort by=HIGH SCORE; Databases=non-redundant, GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+GenBank CDS translations+Swiss protein+Spupdate+PIR. Details of these programs are readily available.",
                                "Alternatively, homology can be determined by hybridization of polynucleotides under conditions which form stable duplexes between homologous regions, followed by digestion with single-stranded-specific nuclease(s), and size determination of the digested fragments. DNA sequences that are substantially homologous can be identified in a Southern hybridization experiment under, for example, stringent conditions, as defined for that particular system. Defining appropriate hybridization conditions is within the skill of the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra; DNA Cloning, supra; Nucleic Acid Hybridization, supra.",

In addition, a sequence of the constant domain of an IgE heavy chain comprising an Asn mutation, which confers resistance to omalizumab, is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. Additional representative IgE sequences are listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. See, for example, NCBI entries: Accession Nos.

Although any source of IgE can be utilized to practice the invention, preferably a benign, non-allergy-inducing IgE derived from a human source is used, particularly when the subject undergoing therapy is human.",
                                "The compositions useful in the methods of the invention may comprise biologically active variants of IgE, including variants of IgE from any species. Such variants should retain the desired biological activity of the native IgE. Methods are available in the art for determining whether a variant IgE retains the desired biological activity, and hence would serve as a therapeutically active component in a pharmaceutical composition. Biological activity can be measured using assays specifically designed for measuring activity of the native IgE, including assays described herein (see Example 1).",
                                "IgE variants can be prepared, for example, by introducing mutations in the cloned DNA sequence encoding the native IgE. Methods for mutagenesis and nucleotide sequence alterations are well known in the art. See, for example, Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983) Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York); Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-492; Kunkel et al. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 154:367-382; Sambrook et al. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 3rd Edition); U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,192; and the references cited therein; herein incorporated by reference. Guidance as to appropriate amino acid substitutions that do not destroy biological activity of a peptide of interest may be found in the model of Dayhoff et al. (1978) in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C.), herein incorporated by reference. Conservative substitutions, such as exchanging one amino acid with another having similar properties, may be preferred. Examples of conservative substitutions include, but are not limited to, Gly\u21d4Ala, Val\u21d4Ile\u21d4Leu, Asp\u21d4Glu, Lys\u21d4Arg, Asn\u21d4Gln, and Phe\u21d4Trp\u21d4Tyr.",
                                "In constructing IgE variants, modifications are made such that variants continue to possess the desired activity. Obviously, any mutations made in the DNA encoding the IgE variant polypeptide must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure.",
                                "Biologically active variants of IgE will generally have at least about 70%, preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90% to 95% or more, and most preferably at least about 98%, 99%, or more amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of a reference IgE protein, which serves as the basis for comparison. A variant may, for example, differ by as few as 1 to 15 amino acid residues, as few as 1 to 10 residues, such as 6-10, as few as 5, as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 amino acid residue.",
                                "With respect to optimal alignment of two amino acid sequences, the contiguous segment of the variant amino acid sequence may have the same number of amino acids, additional amino acid residues or deleted amino acid residues with respect to the reference amino acid sequence. The contiguous segment used for comparison to the reference amino acid sequence will typically include at least 8 contiguous amino acid residues, and may be 10, 12, 13, 17, 36, 40, 50, 60, 70, or more amino acid residues. Corrections for sequence identity associated with conservative residue substitutions or gaps can be made (see, e.g., Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm). A biologically active variant of an IgE polypeptide of interest may differ from the native polypeptide by as few as 1-20 amino acids, including as few as 1-15, as few as 1-10, such as 6-10, or as few as 5, including as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 amino acid residue.",
                                "The precise chemical structure of a protein having IgE activity depends on a number of factors. As ionizable amino and carboxyl groups are present in the molecule, a particular polypeptide may be obtained as an acidic or basic salt, or in neutral form. All such preparations that retain their biological activity when placed in suitable environmental conditions are included in the definition of proteins having IgE activity as used herein. Further, the primary amino acid sequence of the IgE may be augmented by derivatization using sugar moieties (glycosylation), polyethylene glycol (PEG), or by other supplementary molecules such as lipids, phosphate, acetyl, methyl, or pyroglutamyl groups, and the like. It may also be augmented by conjugation with saccharides. Certain aspects of such augmentation are accomplished through post-translational processing systems of the producing host; other such modifications may be introduced in vitro. In any event, such modifications are included in the definition of an IgE polypeptide used herein as long as the IgE activity of the peptide is not destroyed. It is expected that such modifications may quantitatively or qualitatively affect the activity, either by enhancing or diminishing the activity of the IgE variant, in the various assays. Further, individual amino acid residues in the chain may be modified by oxidation, reduction, or other derivatization, and the polypeptide may be cleaved to obtain fragments that retain activity. Such alterations that do not destroy IgE activity are included in the definition of IgE variants as used herein.",

A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the composition in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.",
                                "The amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the nature and function of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects. Generally, however, the excipient(s) will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5% to about 98% by weight, more preferably from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.

By \u201ctherapeutically effective dose or amount\u201d of an omalizumab-resistant IgE variant or omalizumab is intended an amount that, when the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant and omalizumab are administered in combination, brings about a positive therapeutic response with respect to treatment of an individual for an IgE-mediated disorder. By \u201cpositive therapeutic response\u201d is intended the individual undergoing the combination treatment according to the invention exhibits an improvement in one or more symptoms of the IgE-mediated disorder for which the individual is undergoing therapy, such as a reduction in coughing, wheezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, red eyes, hives, swelling, rash, shortness of breath, bronchial inflammation, or other IgE-mediated inflammation.",
                                "In certain embodiments, multiple therapeutically effective doses of either the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant or omalizumab will be administered according to a daily dosing regimen, or intermittently. For example, a therapeutically effective dose can be administered, one day a week, two days a week, three days a week, four days a week, or five days a week, and so forth. By \u201cintermittent\u201d administration is intended the therapeutically effective dose can be administered, for example, every other day, every two days, every three days, once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once a month, and so forth. For example, in some embodiments, an omalizumab-resistant IgE variant and omalizumab will be administered once every two to four weeks for an extended period of time, such as for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 . . . 10 . . . 15 . . . 24 months, and so forth. By \u201ctwice-weekly\u201d or \u201ctwo times per week\u201d is intended that two therapeutically effective doses of the agent in question is administered to the subject within a 7 day period, beginning on day 1 of the first week of administration, with a minimum of 72 hours, between doses and a maximum of 96 hours between doses. By \u201cthrice weekly\u201d or \u201cthree times per week\u201d is intended that three therapeutically effective doses are administered to the subject within a 7 day period, allowing for a minimum of 48 hours between doses and a maximum of 72 hours between doses. For purposes of the present invention, this type of dosing is referred to as \u201cintermittent\u201d therapy. In accordance with the methods of the present invention, a subject can receive intermittent therapy for one or more weekly or monthly cycles until the desired therapeutic response is achieved.

If provided at the same time as the omalizumab, the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant can be provided in the same or in a different composition. Thus, the two agents can be presented to the individual by way of concurrent therapy. By \u201cconcurrent therapy\u201d is intended administration to a human subject such that the therapeutic effect of the combination of the substances is caused in the subject undergoing therapy. For example, concurrent therapy may be achieved by administering at least one therapeutically effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an omalizumab-resistant IgE variant and at least one therapeutically effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition comprising omalizumab according to a particular dosing regimen. Administration of the separate pharmaceutical compositions can be at the same time (i.e., simultaneously) or at different times (i.e., sequentially, in either order, on the same day, or on different days), as long as the therapeutic effect of the combination of these substances is caused in the subject undergoing therapy.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant is administered for a brief period prior to administration of omalizumab and continued for a brief period after treatment with omalizumab is discontinued in order to ensure that IgE levels are adequate in the subject during omalizumab therapy. For example, the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant can be administered starting one week before administration of the first dose of omalizumab and continued for one week after administration of the last dose of omalizumab to the subject.",

Suitable routes of administration include parenteral administration, such as subcutaneous (SC), intraperitoneal (IP), intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), or infusion, oral and pulmonary, nasal, topical, transdermal, and suppositories. Where the composition is administered via pulmonary delivery, the therapeutically effective dose is adjusted such that the soluble level of the agent, such as the omalizumab-resistant IgE variant or omalizumab in the bloodstream, is equivalent to that obtained with a therapeutically effective dose that is administered parenterally, for example SC, IP, IM, or IV. In some embodiments of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising an omalizumab-resistant IgE variant is administered by IM or SC injection, particularly by IM or SC injection locally to the region where the omalizumab used in the anti-IgE therapy is administered. Similarly, omalizumab can be administered by IV, IM, IP or SC injection.",

Generally, a higher dosage of this agent is preferred with increasing weight of the subject undergoing therapy.",
                                "Where a subject undergoing therapy in accordance with the previously mentioned dosing regimens exhibits a partial response or a relapse following a prolonged period of remission, subsequent courses of concurrent therapy may be needed to achieve complete remission of the disease. Thus, subsequent to a period of time off from a first treatment period, a subject may receive one or more additional treatment periods comprising anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab in combination with an omalizumab-resistant IgE variant. Such a period of time off between treatment periods is referred to herein as a time period of discontinuance. It is recognized that the length of the time period of discontinuance is dependent upon the degree of response (e.g., complete or partial recovery from an IgE-mediated disorder, such as an allergic disease, inflammation, or asthma) achieved with any prior treatment periods of concurrent therapy with these therapeutic agents.",

                                "Omalizumab received FDA approval over a decade ago; yet, no structure of the omalizumab:IgE complex has been determined. To understand the structural basis of omalizumab:IgE interactions and its ability to inhibit both Fc\u03b5RI and CD23 binding, we determined the structure of the omalizumab Fab bound to a disulfide bond mutant of the IgE-Fc C\u03b53-C\u03b54 fragment (IgE-G335C-Fc3-4) to 2.5 \u212b (Table 1). Omalizumab binds to the IgE C\u03b53 domains outside of the Fc\u03b5RI-binding site, similar to the anti-IgE Designed Anykyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) E2_79, in good agreement with prior mapping studies of the epitope (Baumann et al. (2010) Immunol. Lett. 133:78-84; Kim et al. (2012) Nature 491:613-617; Presta, L. & Shields, R. in Lung Biology in Health and Disease. Vol. 164 (eds Fick, R. B. Jr. & Jardieu, P. M.) (Marcel Dekker, 2002)). The complex structure clarifies how omalizumab blocks IgE interactions with both the high- and low-affinity receptors. Despite the similarity in omalizumab and E2_79-binding sites on IgE, E2_79 is a disruptive inhibitor that can accelerate the dissociation of IgE:Fc\u03b5RI complexes, while omalizumab has only poor (\u02dc1,000-fold weaker) disruptive activity (Kim et al., supra; Eggel et al. (2014) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 133:1709-1719). Comparison of the omalizumab and E2_79 IgE complexes provides insights into the mechanism of disruptive inhibition, which could help in the development of anti-IgE antibodies with improved disruptive capabilities.",
                                "The omalizumab structure also facilitated the design of an IgE-Fc3-4 mutant (IgE-R419N-Fc3-4) that is resistant to omalizumab neutralization but is able to bind CD23 and Fc\u03b5RI. Significant experimental evidence has accumulated suggesting that IgE-dependent homeostatic regulatory pathways respond to the loss of receptor-bound IgE induced by omalizumab treatment, and could offset or constrain the therapeutic benefit of the anti-IgE treatment (Cooper et al., supra; Bonnefoy et al., supra; Prussin et al. (2003) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 112:1147-1154; MacGlashan et al. (1997) J. Immunol. 158:1438-1445; Zaidi et al. (2010) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 125:902-908 e907; MacGlashan et al. (2012) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 130:1130-1135; Macglashan et al. (2013) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 132:906-911; Aubry et al. (1992) Nature 358:505-507; Fellmann et al. (2015) Immun. Inflamm. Dis. 3:339-349). We demonstrate that the IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 mutant, in combination with omalizumab, can effectively exchange cell-bound IgE with IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 and that this dual inhibitor treatment is more potent at blocking basophil activation than either inhibitor alone. This approach of simultaneously depleting antigen-specific IgE, while engaging Fc\u03b5RI and CD23 receptors with an IgE variant, can be used to further probe the role of IgE-dependent regulatory pathways during anti-IgE treatment and may provide a route to enhance current anti-IgE therapies.",

                                "Structure of the IgE-Omalizumab Complex.",
                                "We previously described an IgE-Fc3-4 mutant (IgE-G335C-Fc3-4), which contains an engineered disulfide bond at position 335 that traps the IgEFc3-4 domain in a closed conformation with reduced conformational flexibility (FIG. 1B, Wurzburg et al. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287:36251-36257). This variant retains high-affinity binding to omalizumab, but not Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (FIGS. 8 and 9). Employing this restrained IgE-Fc3-4 variant, we crystallized the IgE-G335C-Fc3-4:omalizumab-Fab complex (subsequently referred to as the IgE:omalizumab complex). The purified complex (FIGS. 10A, 10B) crystalized in the P21 space group, diffracted X-rays to 2.5 \u212b (Table 1), and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the existing IgE-G335C-Fc3-4 and omalizumab-Fab structures (Wurzburg et al. (2012), supra; Jensen et al. (2015) Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 71:419-426). The asymmetric unit contains two copies of IgE-G335C-Fc3-4, and four copies of the omalizumab-Fab, providing four copies of the IgE:omalizumab interface related by non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). Side-chain electron density was well resolved throughout the IgE:omalizumab interface (FIG. 10C).",
                                "Analysis of the structure revealed that the omalizumab-Fab approaches perpendicularly to the IgE C\u03b53 domain, in contrast to recently proposed models (Wright et al. (2015) Sci. Rep. 5:11581), and contacts symmetric binding sites on the face of the two C\u03b53 domains of the IgE dimer (FIGS. 2A-2C). These contacts are predominantly formed between the omalizumab-Fab and C\u03b53 \u03b2-sheet residues below the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding loops (FG, BC and DE; FIG. 2D). Structural alignment of the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complex (Garman et al., supra) with the IgE:omalizumab complex shows that the binding loops are only slightly perturbed within the IgE:omalizumab complex at receptor site 2 (FIG. 2D); thus, omalizumab does not appear to inhibit IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 interactions by distorting the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding site. Instead, the omalizumab-Fab is positioned between the binding sites of both Fc\u03b5RI and CD23, blocking interactions with both receptors, with the heavy chain proximal to the CD23 site, and the light chain proximal to the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding sites (FIG. 2D). Of note, both the position of the omalizumab epitope on the face of C\u03b53, and the perpendicular binding orientation of the omalizumab Fab, suggest that omalizumab could approach and target a preformed IgE-Fc\u03b5RI complex.",
                                "Impact of IgE-Fc Conformation on Omalizumab Binding.",
                                "We previously demonstrated that omalizumab can bind preformed IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes, but not full-length IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes (Eggel et al., supra). Therefore, we hypothesized that the C\u03b52 domains of full-length IgE in the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complex obscure an omalizumab-binding site that is exposed in the IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complex. As predicted, alignment of the structures of IgE:omalizumab and IgE-Fc24:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes demonstrates that the C\u03b52 domains overlap extensively with an otherwise exposed omalizumab-binding epitope in the IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 structure (FIG. 2E). Therefore, omalizumab's specificity for free IgE is not solely determined by Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 competition, but also by IgE-conformation-dependent masking of its own second omalizumab epitope. These observations suggest that fragmented IgE molecules lacking C\u03b52 could be aggregated by omalizumab, leading to basophil activation (FIG. 11); however, we have not observed this in human basophils or mast cells (Eggel et al., supra).",
                                "Given that the crystal structure lacks the C\u03b52 domain, it cannot account for possible contributions of the C\u03b52 to omalizumab:IgE interactions. Therefore, we also compared the binding kinetics of full-length IgE (clone Sus11) to that of the IgE-Fc3-4 fragments. We hypothesized that the ka of full-length IgE might be slower than that of IgE-Fc3-4 because the C\u03b52 domains obscure one of the two symmetric omalizumab epitopes (FIG. 1), and, as expected, the ka of full-length IgE was 15-30-fold lower as compared with the IgE-Fc3-4 fragments tested (FIG. 8). Surprisingly, the kd of the full-length IgE was also 4.5-10.9-fold slower than any of the three IgE-Fc3-4 fragments tested (FIG. 8). This results in only minor differences in the overall equilibrium Kd(\u02dc3.5-fold) between intact IgE and the IgE-Fc3-4 fragments.",
                                "The IgE C\u03b53 domains also show significant conformational flexibility, adopting closed and open states relative to the C\u03b54 domains that are associated with CD23 and Fc\u03b5RI binding, respectively. The potential impact of these conformational changes on omalizumab binding has not been fully assessed. The localization of the omalizumab epitope on the face of the C\u03b53 domain suggested that omalizumab would interact equally well with both open and closed forms of the IgE-Fc. To examine this possibility, we compared the binding kinetics of omalizumab with wild-type IgE-Fc3-4, the IgE-G335C-Fc3-4 mutant (locked in the closed conformational state (Wurzburg et al. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287:36251-36257)) and with IgE-Fc3-4 bound to Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (stabilized in the open state by receptor binding). IgE-G335C-Fc3-4 exhibited similar kinetics in omalizumab-binding studies as wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 (FIG. 8) but was unable to bind Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (FIG. 9). These data suggest that omalizumab can bind closed conformations of IgE efficiently, and indicate that the crystal structure reflects the normal binding mode of omalizumab for IgE-Fc3-4.",
                                "No mutations have been identified that stabilize the open IgE\u2212Fc3-4 conformational state, making studies of the omalizumab interaction with this state more challenging. However, omalizumab binds to IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes (Eggel et al., supra), and our structural analysis demonstrates that one of the two C\u03b53 domain epitopes is fully accessible to omalizumab. Therefore, to examine the potential impact of the open C\u03b53 domain conformation on omalizumab binding, we measured the kinetics of omalizumab binding to preformed IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes. This analysis revealed an association rate constant (ka) for omalizumab with IgE-Fc3-4 bound to Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes that was closer to full-length IgE alone and slower than unbound IgE-Fc3-4. The similarity in association rates between full-length IgE and IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes may be in part because of the fact that each binding partner contains a single exposed C\u03b53 domain (FIG. 12). The dissociation rate constant (kd) for the omalizumab:IgE-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes was also similar to that of the measured rates for IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 or omalizumab:IgE complexes (FIGS. 8 and 9), consistent with the dissociation of either of these two interfaces during measurement.",
                                "Together, these kinetic data demonstrate that the IgE-Fc C\u03b53 conformations have little or no impact on omalizumab binding and that, in free IgE, the C\u03b52 domain may alter the kinetics of omalizumab binding with a small effect on the affinity of the interaction. These data support the structural observation that omalizumab:IgE interactions are primarily mediated by a stable epitope contained in the C\u03b53 domain. These kinetic data also highlight the critical role of the C\u03b52 domains in the intact receptor-bound IgE, which are required to mask an omalizumab epitope that is not directly blocked by the Fc\u03b5RI itself.",
                                "The Omalizumab Epitope.",
                                "To establish which residues fall within the omalizumab epitope on IgE, we analyzed the interfaces of the omalizumab:IgE complex with PISA (Krissinel et al. (2007) J. Mol. Biol. 372:774-797). All NCS copies shared the majority of contacts, which extend along the length of the C\u03b53 domain, involve 23 IgE residues and bury \u02dc725 \u212b2 of surface area on IgE (FIG. 3A). Previously identified IgE mutants that inhibit omalizumab binding, studied in an intact IgE heavy chain, correspond well with the binding interface observed in the crystal structure (FIG. 3B, Presta et al., supra). After correcting for different numbering schemes and IgE sequences from prior studies (FIG. 13), all residues implicated in omalizumab: IgE binding are within the predicted omalizumab:IgE interface, and many participate in hydrogen bonds (R376, S378, K380, Q417) or salt bridges (R419) predicted by the crystal structure (FIGS. 3C-3E). Notably, IgE E414, a residue implicated in omalizumab-binding studies with the mutants E414R/Q, appears to form an intrachain salt bridge with IgE R376 (FIG. 3D) and may be essential for stabilizing the conformation of the adjacent omalizumab-binding residues (FIGS. 3D, 3E).",
                                "The omalizumab complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, with the exception of the light chain CDR3 loop, contact IgE. CDR residues previously shown to be required for omalizumab binding either contact IgE (light chain D32 in CDR1 (FIG. 3C) and heavy chain H101 in CDR3 (FIG. 3E)) or form interactions with neighboring CDR loops (heavy chain CDR3 H105 and H107) (Presta et al., supra). The complex contains five hydrogen bonds distributed throughout the omalizumab:IgE interface and two salt bridges between light chain residues D32 and D34 and IgE R419 (FIGS. 3C-3E). The heavy chain CDR3, which shows the most extensive conformational change from the unbound omalizumab:Fab structure (PDB ID: 4X7S), also contains three aromatic side chains that contact IgE (Y102, H101, F103; FIG. 3E). Outside of the omalizumab heavy chain CDR3, four additional aromatic side chains contact IgE: Y33 in the heavy chain CDR1, Y36 in the light chain CDR1 and Y53 and Y57 in the light chain CDR1. Therefore, it appears that a network of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and extensive hydrophobic interactions facilitate omalizumab:IgE interactions.",
                                "The IgE residues interacting with omalizumab CDRs are largely distinct from those that engage Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (Presta et al, supra). IgE residues P426 and R427 are the only minor overlapping portions of the omalizumab:IgE-Fc3-4 and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1:IgE-Fc3-4 interfaces as calculated with the PISA analysis (FIG. 3A). Each residue is unique to site 2 of the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1:IgE complex. The residues are adjacent to the omalizumab light chain framework region (FIG. 3A and FIG. 14) and are peripheral to the omalizumab:IgE interface. Only one NCS-related IgE chain has well-resolved electron density for R427, while the remaining copies do not (FIG. 14). Within this chain neither R427 nor P426 make contacts (<4 \u212b) directly with omalizumab; however, R427 indirectly interacts with the light chain framework through a sulfate ion (FIG. 14). Mutations at R427 (R427E) lead to a minor reduction in omalizumab binding (25-56%), suggesting that this residue can affect omalizumab:IgE interactions (Presta et al, supra). In contrast, the R427E mutation substantially reduced Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 binding to IgE, while another mutant series that contained a R427A mutation only partially reduced Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 binding (Presta et al., supra). Although omalizumab may directly compete with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 for IgE residues, the extent of direct competition and binding site overlap involves at most two amino acids.",
                                "The Structural Basis of Fc\u03b5RI and CD23 Competition.",
                                "Omalizumab inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 and CD23 binding could arise from contributions of multiple structural mechanisms, including direct competition for receptor-binding residues on IgE, steric clashes caused by physical overlap of omalizumab and IgE receptors and potential omalizumab-induced conformational changes in IgE. The kinetic and structural data suggest that omalizumab does not induce conformational changes in Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding loops or in the relative positions of the C\u03b53 domains that could affect receptor binding. Omalizumab also shows minimal overlap with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding residues; however, physical overlap between the bound omalizumab Fab and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 could be substantial and critical to omalizumab activity.",
                                "To gain quantitative insight into the contribution of inhibitor overlap in blocking IgE interactions with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 and CD23, we calculated the theoretical volumes of atomic overlap between omalizumab and its two IgE receptors. First, we performed a structural alignment of the C\u03b53 domain of the IgE:omalizumab complex with the C\u03b53 domain of the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complex at sites 1 and 2 (FIG. 4A). This alignment strategy accounts for the variability of open and closed IgE conformations observed across IgE crystal structures (Dhaliwal et al., supra; Wurzburg et al. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287:36251-36257; Wurzburg et al. (2009) J. Mol. Biol. 393:176-190). We then calculated the volume of atomic overlap between the superimposed omalizumab and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 proteins. This analysis revealed that, for the omalizumab-binding site proximal to Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 binding site 2, there are significant steric clashes between the antibody light chain and both domains of the Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 receptor (FIG. 4A), while no clashes exist at site 1. These structural data indicate that omalizumab's mechanism of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 inhibition involves substantial steric conflict with the receptor at site 2, while direct competition for Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding residues is limited.",
                                "Omalizumab has also been shown to inhibit the binding of CD23 (Cohen et al. (2014) MAbs 6:756-764). Both substantial steric overlap between omalizumab and CD23, and direct competition for IgE-binding residues by the omalizumab heavy chain, contribute to omalizumab inhibition of CD23 binding (FIGS. 4B, 4C). The degree of steric overlap of omalizumab with CD23 is significantly greater than that observed for Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (FIG. 4B). Binding-site comparisons also demonstrate a more extensive overlap between IgE residues that engage omalizumab and CD23 in their respective complexes as compared with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (FIG. 4C).",

                                "We recently described a class of IgE inhibitors derived from Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) libraries, capable of disrupting IgE:Fc\u03b5RI complexes (Kim et al. (2012) Nature 491:613-617; Eggel et al. (2014) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 133:1709-1719). These agents target preformed IgE: Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes found on mast cells and basophils and accelerate the dissociation rate constant to release free IgE. The activated release of IgE on the surface of effector cells might prove beneficial in treating acute allergic reactions and enhance the clearance of allergen-specific IgE during anti-IgE therapy by targeting both cellular and serum pools of IgE simultaneously. We have demonstrated that a bivalent DARPin (bi53_79) containing a non-competitive IgE-binding domain and a disruptive competitor domain dissociates complexes with greater efficiency in vitro and shows greater potency than omalizumab in blocking passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice bearing the human Fc\u03b5RI receptor (Eggel et al., supra). To our surprise, we also observed that omalizumab is not strictly a competitive inhibitor of IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 interactions, but at higher concentrations it is also capable of targeting and disrupting IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes (Eggel et al., supra). We have published the crystal structure of the DARPin-based inhibitor E2_79 (Kim et al., supra), which is able to accelerate the dissociation of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes at concentrations B3,000\u00d7 above the E2_79:IgE KD (Kim et al., supra). In contrast, omalizumab shows an ability to disrupt preformed Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes at concentrations that are much higher (\u02dc1,000,000-fold greater) than the omalizumab:IgE KD (Eggel et al., supra), indicating that it is much less efficient at the process of binding to and dissociating these preformed complexes. We hypothesized that this difference in disruptive capability was related to the binding-site locations for E2_79 and omalizumab on IgE and the level of atomic overlap between each inhibitor and receptor. We therefore compared the structure of both the E2_79:IgE-G335C-Fc3-4 complex (E2_79:IgE) and the omalizumab:IgE complex.",
                                "The structure of the E2_79:IgE complex demonstrated that the E2_79-binding sites do not overlap with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding residues, while omalizumab exhibits only minor peripheral interactions with two Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1-binding residues (Kim et al., supra). Instead, similar to omalizumab, E2_79 exhibited steric conflicts with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 in aligned structures of the complexes. Given that both agents can disrupt preformed IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes (Eggel et al., supra), we sought to quantitatively compare their relevant steric clashes with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 when bound to IgE, by computing the predicted volume of atom-atom overlap of each inhibitor with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 in aligned complex structures. This analysis reveals that omalizumab has roughly three times the volume of atomic overlap with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 compared with E2_79 (omalizumab and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1=1,183 \u212b3 versus E2_79 and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1=401 \u212b3). The omalizumab steric conflicts extend along the length of the omalizumab light chain and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 N-terminal domain, while the E2_79 steric conflicts are more localized near the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 interface (FIGS. 4A and 4D, Pettersen et al. (2004) J. Comput. Chem. 25:1605-1612). Since the E2_79 and omalizumab-binding sites are substantially overlapping on the IgE-Fc (FIG. 15), this large difference in steric overlap with Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 stands out as a prominent structural feature that correlates with the relative disruptive activities of these inhibitors. Conformational dynamics in the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complex may transiently allow E2_79 association and subsequent acceleration of Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 dissociation (Kim et al., supra). Given the significantly larger region of steric conflicts observed between omalizumab and Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1, conformational states of the IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 that could accommodate omalizumab association may simply be less accessible and/or occur with lower frequency, explaining its lower activity. A significant fraction of the steric clashes with both inhibitors occur between the protein backbone of omalizumab or E2_79 and carbohydrate groups on Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (FIG. 4E). These carbohydrate groups likely explore a wider range of conformations, and may help facilitate the association of these inhibitors to preformed IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes.",
                                "A single IgE mutation prevents omalizumab binding. To further validate observations from the crystal structure, we produced an additional IgE-Fc3-4 mutant. IgE residue R419 lies at the interface of the IgE:omalizumab complex, forming contacts with both light and heavy chain CDR loops (FIG. 3C) and participating in salt bridges. Mutation of R419 to an asparagine (R419N) introduces the glycosylation consensus sequence\u2014asparagine valine threonine (NVT) (FIG. 5A). We hypothesized that by mutating this residue we would abolish omalizumab binding by introducing a glycosylation site at the core of the omalizumab epitope.",
                                "The R419N mutation induced a shift in the mass of recombinant IgE-Fc3-4 as assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, consistent with the introduction of an additional N-linked glycan (FIGS. 5A, 5B). The IgE-Fc3-4 contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, N371 and N394 (Nettleton et al. (1995) Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 107:328-329; Shade et al. (2015) J. Exp. Med. 212:457-467). We have found in recombinant preparations of IgE-Fc3-4 that glycosylation at N371 is heterogeneous and leads to a minor band in purified material (FIG. 5B). Both major and minor species of IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 remain in similar proportions to wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 species, with similar mobility shifts in SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the shift in apparent mass for IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 relative to wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 was lost on digestion with PNGaseF, confirming that it is caused by N-linked glycosylation (FIG. 5B). This additional glycosylation in the middle of the omalizumab epitope completely abolishes omalizumab binding, but only slightly perturbs IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 binding to Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; FIGS. 5C, 5D and summary data FIGS. 8 and 9). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the R419N mutation introduces a novel glycosylation site to yield an omalizumab-resistant IgE-Fc3-4 variant.",
                                "Exchange of IgE on human basophils. The paradigm of using anti-IgE treatment to deplete free IgE (both allergic and non-allergic species) has proven successful for controlling allergic diseases. During omalizumab therapy, omalizumab neutralizes free serum IgE and slowly decreases surface levels of IgE on allergic effector cells. Therefore, it is impossible to simultaneously replace depleted allergen-reactive species with benign IgE species because of the requirement for continued excess omalizumab to be present during treatment. Since IgE-dependent homeostatic regulatory pathways could potentially counteract anti-IgE therapies, we sought to explore the possibility of replacing rather than removing patient IgE. We hypothesized that omalizumab-resistant IgE variants or fragments could be used in combination with omalizumab to effectively exchange the native IgE on human cells bearing Fc\u03b5RI or CD23.",
                                "Over the course of omalizumab treatment, free IgE levels and IgE surface levels on basophils decline relatively rapidly within days (Arm et al. (2014) Clin. Exp. Allergy 44:1371-1385), while mast cell IgE levels persist for significantly longer (Beck et al. (2004) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 114:527-530). The rapid decline of basophil-associated IgE may in part be driven kinetically by basophil turnover in vivo (MacGlashan et al. (2015) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 135:294-295). However, within the experimental timeframe for our ex vivo experiments with human whole blood (24-48 hours), we did not observe significant loss of cell surface IgE at doses corresponding to the mean omalizumab serum concentrations from clinical trials (Korn et al. (2012) Respir Med. 106:1494-1500). Therefore, we employed supraphysiologic doses of omalizumab (25 \u03bcM) to enhance the removal of IgE as described previously (Eggel et al., supra). These doses were used here to accelerate the loss of cell-bound IgE to facilitate these exchange experiments. Nonetheless, lower therapeutic doses of omalizumab are sufficient to capture free IgE and reduce cell surface levels of IgE over time, which is the basis of omalizumab's therapeutic effect.",
                                "To track the addition, removal and exchange of IgE species, we employed biotinylated IgE-Fc3-4 or omalizumab-resistant IgE-R419N-Fc3-4, and the JW8 human/mouse chimeric IgE (composed of a human IgE heavy chain and a mouse-l-light chain). The JW8 mouse-l-light chain allowed us to track IgE reloading on stripped basophils in parallel with the biotinylated IgE\u2212Fc3-4 proteins. We ensured that all antibody reagents used in staining carried the mouse-k-light chain, or were rat antibodies, to avoid nonspecific binding from the anti-mouse-l-light-chain antibody used to track JW8-IgE.",
                                "We isolated blood from three donors, and depleted surface IgE on basophils by treating each sample with the disruptive inhibitor E2_79 (FIG. 6A, gating scheme FIG. 16). We then reloaded the cells with JW8-IgE (FIG. 6A), while also verifying that stripped cells could be reloaded with biotinylated IgE-Fc3-4 or IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 species (FIG. 6A). Therefore, we could remove native IgE species, reload cells with homogeneous traceable IgE and subsequently track the removal or exchange of JW8-IgE (FIGS. 6B, 6C). The 1-light-chain-specific staining of JW8 and biotin-specific staining of the IgE-Fc3-4 variants distinguished human basophils that had no JW8-IgE or biotinylated-IgE-Fc3-4, a mix of both species, or a single IgE species (FIGS. 6B, 6C).",
                                "Overnight omalizumab treatment of cells that had been homogenously reloaded with JW8-IgE completely removed the JW8-IgE from the cell surface, as shown by an overlay of the pre- and post-treatment flow cytometry profiles (arrow, FIG. 6D). Co-administration of IgE-Fc3-4 and omalizumab also showed complete depletion of JW8-IgE species but no exchange for IgEFc3-4 at 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 IgE doses (FIG. 6D). In contrast, co-administration of omalizumab-resistant IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 with omalizumab depleted JW8-IgE surface levels, and facilitated IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 reloading to levels observed in IgE-stripped basophils treated with IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 alone (FIG. 6D). Therefore, co-administration of omalizumab and IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 effectively exchanges the receptor-bound IgE on human basophils for IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 ex vivo. Even when wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 doses far beyond physiologic IgE levels were employed (10 \u03bcg ml\u22121), only minimal reloading of wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 was observed, in contrast to the dramatic reloading of IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 (FIG. 17). This effect was not restricted to Fc\u03b5RI-expressing basophils. CD23+B-cells treated with omalizumab and IgE-Fc3-4 variants retained surface IgE-R419N-Fc3-4, but were stripped of wild-type IgE-Fc3-4. Furthermore, both wild-type IgE-Fc3-4 and IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 occupancy of the CD23 receptor stabilized surface CD23 and increased CD23 surface levels. Importantly, IgE-mediated stabilization of surface CD23 prevents the release of soluble CD23 (sCD23), a soluble mediator shown to upregulate IgE expression (Cooper et al., supra; Fellmann et al., supra).",

                                "To determine whether IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 could enhance the effect of omalizumab treatment in human cells, we performed basophil-activation tests. Basophils were isolated from healthy donors, treated with DARPins to remove surface IgE (using the enhanced bi53_79 DARPin (Eggel et al., supra)) and reloaded with the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-specific JW8-IgE. The resultant NP-reactive basophils were then left untreated or were treated with omalizumab (at therapeutic concentrations of 500 nM), IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 or combinations of both agents for 3 (FIG. 7A) or 6 days (FIG. 7B) before NP-antigen challenge. Given that IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes dissociate slowly, and omalizumab is a weak disruptive inhibitor at the therapeutically relevant concentration used, we did not anticipate a rapid response in basophils homogenously reloaded with JW8-IgE. Accordingly, after 3 days, there were no significant reductions in basophil responses as compared with untreated controls (FIG. 7A). Of note, omalizumab transiently increased basophil sensitivity on day 3, although this effect was overcome by day 6, presumably as omalizumab neutralized a greater fraction of JW8-IgE previously bound to cells. Although this effect was not significant, it does fit with clinical studies, which suggest that basophil sensitivity is increased on a per IgE basis during omalizumab therapy (Macglashan et al. (2013) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 132:906-911). There was significantly less activation in cells treated with a combination of omalizumab and IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 (100 nM) as compared with omalizumab alone by day 3 (FIG. 7A), suggesting that combination therapy could offset this transient effect in omalizumab-treated samples. By day 6, a significant reduction in basophil activation was observed in all treatment arms as compared with the untreated controls (FIG. 7B). This result was surprising, given that IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 alone was able to inhibit basophil reactivity at 1 nM concentrations (FIG. 7B). Furthermore, in combination with omalizumab, 1 nM IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 almost completely inhibited basophil activation (FIG. 7B). The additive effect of omalizumab (500 nM) and IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 (1 nM) should be minor if each agent acted only as a competitive inhibitor for JW8-IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 interactions, suggesting that these agents can act synergistically to block basophil activation.",
                                "Discussion",
                                "Anti-IgE therapy remains an important tool for the management of allergic disorders, and novel second-generation anti-IgE therapies will soon join omalizumab. Yet, the etiology of allergic disorders is complex and optimal therapeutic responses will likely come from treatment regimens that target and modulate multiple immunological processes.",
                                "Here we have clarified the structural basis for omalizumab-mediated inhibition of IgE binding to both Fc\u03b5RI and CD23. This analysis revealed similarities between the disruptive inhibitor E2_79 and omalizumab, and provides a mechanistic framework to develop antibody-based therapies that can accelerate the dissociation of IgE:Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 complexes. Such agents could rapidly disarm basophils and mast cells, allowing them to achieve a therapeutic effect faster.",
                                "We have also demonstrated that mutant IgE fragments, in conjunction with omalizumab treatment, can exchange native IgE on human cells for IgE fragments, maintaining the occupancy of both high- and low-affinity IgE receptors. We pursued this approach, given the experimental evidence that basophils increase in sensitivity on a per IgE basis during omalizumab treatment (Zaidi et al. (2010) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 125:902-908 e907; MacGlashan et al. (2012) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 130:1130-1135; Macglashan et al. (2013) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 132:906-911), and that IgE production can be regulated by IgE:CD23 signaling (Cooper et al., supra; Sherr et al., supra; Bonnefoy et al., supra; Aubry et al., supra; Fellmann et al., supra). These observations raise significant questions about the impact of therapeutic IgE depletion, and suggest that homeostatic responses to the loss of IgE could offset or constrain the therapeutic benefit of anti-IgE treatment. Our experimental observations provide a system to test some of these regulatory pathways and could potentially be used as an adjunct therapy with omalizumab. To this end, we have also demonstrated that IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 can act synergistically with omalizumab ex vivo at very low doses to inhibit basophil activation. This finding suggests that simultaneously targeting Fc\u03b5RI and IgE with competitive inhibitors could enhance therapeutic responses. Prior studies have demonstrated that non-activating ligands can antagonize Fc\u03b5RI responses to activating ligands by sequestering receptor-proximal signaling components (Torigoe et al. (1998) Science 281:568-572), and it is possible that IgE-R419N-Fc3-4:Fc\u03b5RI complexes could suppress activation through such mechanisms, in addition to competing for receptor occupancy. Sustained Fc\u03b5RI receptor occupancy could also suppress homeostatic responses to the loss of IgE on omalizumab-treated basophils.",
                                "Finally, the dissociation of allergen-specific IgE on mast cells located in peripheral tissues is slow, and the effectiveness of anti-IgE within these compartments is poorly understood (Beck et al. (2004) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 114:527-530). Given that the Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells has been shown to drive IgE tissue localization (Cheng et al. (2013) Immunity 38:166-175), co-administration of omalizumab and omalizumab-resistant IgE fragments that bind Fc\u03b5RI may enhance the exchange of allergen-specific IgE in peripheral sites, and contribute to the therapeutic benefit of anti-IgE treatment.",
                                "Despite the potential utility of IgE exchange, and promising ex vivo results, the concept is far from clinical application. Unexpected antibody responses to the R419N IgE, although unlikely, could prevent the development of any universally benign IgE variant for exchange therapy, and could induce anaphylactic antibody responses to receptor-bound IgE fragments. Yet, our approach with IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 does have two distinct advantages in this regard. First, N-linked glycosylation events are effective at masking antibody epitopes, and could reduce the immunogenicity of IgE-R419N-Fc3-4 (Wei et al. et al. (2003) Nature 422:307-312). Second, the new antigenic surface generated by truncating IgE to the C\u03b53-4 domains would be largely inaccessible once bound to Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1, preventing any antibody responses to this epitope from crosslinking receptor-bound IgE fragments. Given that anti-IgE and anti-Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 antibody responses are relatively common, and are not always pathological (Chan et al. (2014) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 134:1394-1401), it is possible that such an approach could be well tolerated.",

Automated model building to improve early models was performed using Phenix AutoBuild, and refinement was performed using rounds of Phenix Refine and manual model building with Coot (version 0.8.1, Emsley et al. (2004) Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 60:2126-2132). NCS restraints were identified automatically in phenix. refine by sequence similarity and default root mean squared deviation tolerance of <2 \u212b. NCS restraints were applied in early rounds of refinement and removed in final rounds of refinement. The final model was refined to 2.5 \u212b (Table 1) and was validated using MolProbity and Phenix comprehensive validation. The model had Ramachandran-favored conformations in >97% of residues and 0.2% of residues were outliers. The relatively high B-factors after refinement are expected, given the high-average Wilson B-factor (61.89).",

The alignment with the CD23:IgE complex was made with either C\u03b53 domain within the CD23 complex (similar results were found with both alignments in this symmetric complex). The coordinates of each IgE-binding molecule (Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1, omalizumab, E2_79 and CD23) from these aligned complexes were then loaded into pdbset (CCP4) and centered within an arbitrarily defined unit cell to accommodate the full chain. The coordinates of the aligned and transformed structures were then input into sfall (CCP4) to generate an atom map from the polypeptide chain (solvent atoms and ligands were not included), and input into mapmsk (CCP4) to make a map mask. The resulting map masks were input into overlapmap (CCP4) using the MAP INCLUDE function, keeping only density of overlapping regions of each inhibitor with the receptor complex in question. The volume of the resulting overlap maps were then calculated with the volumes tool in Chimera (Pettersen et al., supra).",
