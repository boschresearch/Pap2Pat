                        "Human cancer is caused in part by structural changes resulting in DNA copy number alterations (CNA) at distinct locations in the tumor genome. Identification of such CNAs in tumor tissues has contributed significantly to both the understanding of disease etiology (e.g., pathogenesis or progression) and the expansion of therapeutic avenues across multiple cancers. However, current detection techniques suffer from limitations, which limit the reliability of the current detection techniques in clinical and research settings.",
                        "Traditionally, CNAs have been detected using cytogenic techniques, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization, and representational oligonucleotide microarrays, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. However, each of these traditional techniques is limited with regard to the number, resolution, and platform-specific accessibility of regions that can be interrogated in the genome. More recently, massively parallel sequencing technologies have provided the ability to comprehensively characterize genome-scale DNA CNAs in tumor tissues. In particular, whole-exome sequencing (WES) offers a cost-effective way of interrogating mutation and copy number profiles within protein-coding regions in the tumor genome. This has resulted in the increasing use of WES in both research and clinical settings. However, detecting CNAs in WES data can be challenging at least due to the non-trivial selection of algorithm-specific parameters due to variability in tumor content among clinical samples, as well as random technical variability in DNA library enrichment."

                        "This disclosure relates to systems and methods that employ a noise model generated based on control samples to detect copy number alterations (CNA) in at least one test sample. The systems and methods can detect CNAs in the at least one test sample without requiring parameter choices or user intervention. In some examples, the term CNA can refer to somatic CNAs that affect at least a portion of an animal or plant body. Generally, a CNA is an alteration of the DNA of a genome that results in a cell having an abnormal number of copies of one or more sections of the DNA. For example, CNAs can correspond to relatively large regions of the genome that have been deleted (fewer than the normal number) or added (more than the normal number) on certain chromosomes. In some examples, CNAs can be used to detect, diagnose, or study a given disease (a pathological condition of a living animal or plant body or one of its parts that impairs normal functioning and is typically manifested by distinguishing signs and symptoms). Examples of diseases or disease states that can exhibit CNAs include cancer (e.g., various tumors), psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, Schizophrenia, etc.), autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus), and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.) to name a few.",
                        "The test samples analyzed by the systems and methods of this disclosures can include sequencing data that can be profiled to measure the activity (or expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function. For example, the sequencing data of the test samples can be profiled using a whole genome panel, a whole exome panel, or a targeted resequencing panel for a predetermined portion of one of the genome or the exome. Systems and methods disclosed herein can generate a model of inherent noise due to the protocols used to obtain the sequencing data. For example, the model can correspond to noise likely arising from technical variability in storage and processing of biological samples, DNA capture, hybridization and/or amplification as well as variability in sequencing platforms. The model can establish chromosome-specific thresholds estimating variability associated with the inherent noise to detect CNAs. The noise model thus can provide noise thresholds for respective chromosomes to effectively filter out inherent noise arising from the protocols used to obtain the sequencing data. The approach disclosed herein can effectively model noise in a manner that is both platform-agnostic and sample-agnostic, thereby demonstrating its global applicability and utility.",
                        "The noise model can be applied to sequencing data to detect CNAs, such as for use in a clinical setting (e.g., for diagnosis, monitoring, or the like of a disease in a patient) and/or a research setting (e.g., for studying the CNAs related to a disease in one or more population groups). In the clinical setting, the systems and methods can compare a noise model constructed from a comparison of normal samples to the test (or disease) sample to detect the CNAs. The CNAs can be used, for example, in a tumor biopsy. In the research setting, the systems and methods can compare a noise model constructed from a comparison of control samples to the population of test sample to detect the CNAs.",
                        "FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system 10 that can detect copy number alterations (CNA) in test sample data 18, which can include sequencing data for one or more test samples. The system 10 can utilize a noise model generated based on control data 13 to detect the CNAs in the test sample data 18. The system 10 can detect CNAs in the test sample data 18 in a manner that does not require the manual assignment of one or more non-intuitive parameters like traditional techniques. Therefore, the system 10 does not suffer from significant variability in the CNAs detected between users (e.g., clinicians or researchers) exhibited with use of the traditional techniques. The system 10 can be data-driven, requiring no a priori assumptions of the sequencing measurements, therefore eliminating the need for user-assigned parameters and limiting the variability across users, platforms, and application contexts. As an example, the samples (the control data 13, the test sample data 18 or both) can be frozen samples or formalin-fixed paraffin-enabled (FFPE) samples, which generally include partially-degraded or limited genomic material. In addition to sequencing protocol itself, the storage and processing of the physical samples, including control samples and test samples, can introduce noise (e.g., variability) into the sequencing data 13 and 18.",

The noise model generation unit 12 and the CNA detection unit 16 can be embodied in one or more computing devices (e.g., servers, generalized computing device, or the like) that include at least one non-transitory memory and at least one processing resource (e.g., a processor, a processing core, or the like). The non-transitory memory 14 can store computer readable instructions and data. The processing resource can access the memory for executing computer readable instructions, such as for performing the functions and methods of the model generation unit 12 and the CNA detection unit 16 described herein.",
                        "The noise model generation unit 12 can be programmed to generate a noise model based on control data 13 stored in a non-transitory memory 14 to represent inherent noise detected in control samples. For example, the noise model can represent chromosome-specific noise levels inherent in a common set of protocols used to obtain the control data 13 and the test sample data 18. The set of protocols can include storage and handling of samples as well as sequencing protocols used to generate the data from respective samples. The memory 14 can be external to the noise model generation unit 12 or implemented within the noise model generation unit 12. The noise model generation unit 12 can pass the noise model to the CNA detection unit 16, which can use the noise model to detect CNAs in test data from at least one test sample 18. The CNA detection unit 16 can output data related to the CNAs in the test data to an output device 20, which can display information related to the CNAs in the test data to a user of the output device 20 (e.g., a clinician or a researcher). The information can include, for example, a probability score (e.g., a p value) for each CNA determined from the test data 18. In some examples, the output device 20 can be a monitor, a GUI, a display, a printer, a speaker, or other device that can render the output in a tangible form comprehensible by the user.",

The user inputs can, for example, be used to select one or more of the control sample data 13 from the (local or remote) non-transitory memory 14 for the generation of the noise model. As another example, the user inputs can be used for filtering and setting specific confidence intervals. The I/O unit 28 can interface with the (local or remote) non-transitory memory 14 to access the control sample data 13 and provide the noise model to the CNA detection unit 16. In some examples, the noise model can be stored in the memory 22 and accessed by the CNA detection unit 16. The CNA detection unit 16 can be implemented as executable instructions residing in the same or different memory 22.",

In other examples, the control sample data 13 can represent control samples exhibiting similar or the same characteristics of a certain phenotype. As disclosed herein, the control sample data 13 can include sequencing data obtained via a common protocol (e.g., using a whole genome panel, a whole exome panel, or a targeted resequencing panel for a predetermined portion of one of the genome or the exome).",

The identifier 32 can perform pairwise random comparisons (e.g., normal-normal or control-control), at element 36. The pairwise comparisons can be comparisons of the same chromosomes from different normal samples. Based on the comparisons, at element 38, the identifier 32 can estimate segmental log ratio values for a plurality of segments. The segmental log ratio values can be used to correlate the comparisons. At element 40, the identifier 32 can establish chromosome-specific noise thresholds for each of a plurality of chromosomes in the compared data based on the segmental log ratios. For example, the estimated segmental log ratio values can be based on a determined entropy threshold for each chromosome based on an evaluation of an entropy of the free distribution for each respective chromosome. A coverage threshold can them be determined for each chromosome based on an evaluation of a fraction of windows having a non-zero frequency across sample pairs. The noise thresholds can account for different types of variability in the data. For example, the noise thresholds can be determined based on the entropy threshold and/or the coverage threshold determined for each respective chromosome and can account for sample-to-sample technical variability and/or platform-specific technical variability.",
                        "Referring back to FIG. 2, the model generator 34 can generate the noise model by computing a probability distribution representing each of the chromosome-specific noise thresholds. For example, the model generator 34 can estimate generalized extreme value distribution parameters and generate the noise model based on the estimated extreme value distribution parameters. The model generator 34 can compute the noise model by calculating the probability distribution representing each of the chromosome specific noise thresholds, such as by estimating generalized extreme value distribution parameters thereof. The noise model, thus, can correspond to the set of estimated extreme value distribution parameters. Additionally, the generalized extreme value distribution parameters can be estimated for copy number amplifications as well as for copy number deletions. The resulting noise model define chromosome-specific thresholds that account for one or more of sample-to-sample technical variability as well as or platform-specific technical variability (e.g., specific to the manner samples are stored and handled as well as sequencing data is generated from the samples).",

The CNA detection unit 16 is configured to employ the parameters established by the noise model to detect CNAs in sequencing data produced according to a common protocol used to produce the sequencing data (control data) that was used to generate the noise model. The CNA detection unit 16 can include a non-transitory memory 42, a processing resource 44, a user interface 46, and an input/output (I/O) 48. The non-transitory memory 42 can store data and machine-readable instructions. The data can include one or more noise model produced by the noise model generation unit 12. The processing resource 44 can access the non-transitory memory and execute the machine-readable instructions. The user interface 46 can enable user inputs to and outputs from the CNA detection unit 16. The user inputs can, for example, be used to select or set a confidence interval for the detected CNAs. Additionally, the user interface can be used to specify a location for test sample data 18, which can be stored locally or remotely from the CAN detection unit 16. The I/O 48 can interface with the noise model generation unit 12 to receive the noise model. The I/O unit 48 can also receive the test sample data 18 (e.g., a user input or machine input of results of a medical test, such as a patient's tumor biopsy). The I/O unit 48 can also interface with the output device 20 to communicate an output related to the CNAs. For example, the output can include data representing detected CNAs for one or more test samples, and a confidence interval associated with each of the detected CNAs.",

The receiver 50 can be configured to receive the test sample data 18 (e.g., from memory) using the I/O 48. In some examples, the test sample data 18 can represent sequencing data generated (e.g., in-house or by a third party DNA sequencing laboratory) from a patient sample (e.g., a tumor biopsy or other medical test). In other examples, the test sample 18 can represent sequencing data from a plurality of patients (e.g., for research regarding a population). Additionally, the test sample data 18 can include sequencing data for each sample obtained via a common protocol (e.g., using a whole genome panel, a whole exome panel, or a targeted resequencing panel for a predetermined portion of one of the genome or the exome).",

Again, the test sample data 18 and the normal sequencing data correspond to sequencing data obtained via a common protocol. As mentioned, the common protocol corresponds to the protocol used to produce sequencing data from which the noise model has been generated. The CNA calculator is configured to identify CNAs in the test sample based on the comparing, such as to provide estimation of segmental LogRatios for each sample-normal comparison. The comparing can eliminate variations and artifacts due to data collection or between samples. For example, the CNA-model evaluator 54 can employ the model with respect to the segmental Log Ratios to evaluate the probability whether candidate CNAs are due to inherent noise. The evaluator 54 can communicate statistics (e.g., p values) and other information for the identified CNAs to an output device 20 through the I/O 48. The output device 20 can provide output data and other information (e.g., confidence intervals) related to the identified CNAs in the test sample.",

The CNA calculator 52, at element 56, can perform comparisons (disease-normal or test-control) in a comparison between the test sample 18 to ascertain a preliminary indication of variations in copy number. At 58, segmental Log Ratios are estimated for each of the comparisons, such as to provide estimated segmental Log Ratio values for each disease-normal comparison. For example, the comparisons at 56 can include read depth comparisons and circular binary segmentation can be employed at 58 to estimate segmental LogRatios for each disease-normal comparison. It is to be appreciated that the disease-normal samples may be matched samples. In other examples, the CNA calculator 52 can be implemented for reliably detecting CNAs in disease samples (e.g., tumors) even in the absence of a matched normal sample. That is, the approach disclosed herein does not require matched-normal samples since the noise model is agnostic to the platform and tissue samples being used. Additionally, the CNA detection unit can reliably determined CNAs irrespective of tumor content (e.g., results are independent of the purity of the tumor content). As mentioned, separate segmental LogRatios can be determined for copy number deletions and copy number amplifications. In some examples, GC base correction and distribution adjustments can also be implemented to mitigate associated error.",
                        "At 59, the significance of the segmental log ratios can be evaluated with respect to the noise model. For example, the estimated segmental log ratio values for each of the plurality of chromosomes can be evaluated with respect to the chromosome-specific noise thresholds defined by the noise model. The noise model can provide chromosome-specific thresholds to remove variability in the estimated CNAs due inherent noise. The CNAs can be identified at 59 based on applying the noise model (e.g., based on EVD distribution) to the segmental LogRatios to compute a probability of CNAs to indicate whether the CNAs correspond to noise or due actual additions or deletions. For example, the significance of the estimated segmental log ratios having positive values with respect to the chromosome-specific extreme value distribution parameters for copy number amplifications can be used to determine copy number amplifications. Similarly, the significance of the estimated segmental log ratio having negative values with respect to the chromosome-specific extreme value distribution parameters can be used to determine copy number deletions.",
                        "FIGS. 6 and 7 show examples of some possible different uses of system 10. FIG. 6 shows the system 10 being used in a clinical setting (for a single patient, such as a tumor biopsy), while FIG. 7 shows the system 10 being used in a research setting (for a population of patients). The data produced from the normal sample 64 or the control sample 74 and the disease sample 72 or the data obtained for the population sample 72 can be produced using a protocol 66, 76. As an example, the protocol can include preparation and handling of tissue samples, and can include use freezing or FFPE, which can affect and, in some cases, cause damage to the sample. Advantageously, the noise model generated according to the approach disclosed herein can characterize the level of noise/damage resulting from FFPE, freezing or other tissue preparation methods for the sample under test.",
                        "As another example, the protocol 66, 76 can profile the data according to a whole genome panel, a whole exome panel, or a targeted resequencing panel for a predetermined portion of one of the genome or the exome. In either the example of FIG. 6 or FIG. 7, the detected CNAs can be further analyzed to attribute the CNAs to a given disease, as a diagnostic for a given patient or a given population as the case may be. As another example, the detected CNAs can be used to determine novel diagnostic, prognostic and/or theranostic biomarkers as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In the diagnostic case, for example, a potential diagnosis can be output based on the identified CNAs along with a probability of the potential diagnosis (e.g., a percent probability, a confidence interval, or the like).",
                        "In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, example methods will be better appreciated with reference to FIGS. 8-10. While, for the purposes of simplicity of explanation, the example methods of FIGS. 8-10 are shown and described as executing serially, the present examples are not limited by the illustrated order, as some actions could in other examples occur in different orders and/or concurrently from that shown and described herein. Moreover, it is not necessary that all described actions be performed to implement a method.

For example, method 80 can be executed by a system (e.g., the system shown in FIG. 1) that can include a non-transitory memory that stores machine executable instructions and a processing resource to access the non-transitory memory and execute the instructions to cause a computing device to perform the method 80.",

At 84, the noise model can be used (e.g., by CNA detection unit 16) to detect CNAs in the test data. At 86, the CNAs in the test data (and/or additional data related to the CNAs, such as confidence intervals) can be output (e.g., by an output device 20). In some examples, information corresponding to the confidence intervals can be selected by a user (e.g., clinician or researcher) and entered into the noise model generation unit 12 or the CNA detection unit 16.",

At 92, sequencing data for normal samples (or control samples) can be accessed. At 94, normal-normal comparisons can be analyzed for respective chromosomes in the normal samples to determine indications of noise. The noise can be inherent noise due to protocol, which can include noise due to handling and storage of samples as well as the data collection/sequencing procedures utilized to generate the sequencing data that is being processed. At 96, the resulting noise model is generated and stored in non-transitory memory to represent the determined indications of noise. For example, the noise model can represent variability in chromosome-specific noise corresponding to the protocol.",

Normal sequencing data is also received. The test sample data represents sequencing data that was produced according to a protocol that is common to the protocol utilized to generate a corresponding noise model (FIG. 9). At 1004, the test sample can be compared to the normal sequencing data. For example, chromosomes of the test sample can be compared to normal sequencing data (e.g., a pairwise comparison) to determine variations for respective chromosome pairs. At 1006, CNAs can be identified in the test sample based on the comparison.
