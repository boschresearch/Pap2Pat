    "abstract": "Reliable detection of somatic copy-number alterations (sCNAs) in tumors using whole-exome sequencing (WES) remains challenging owing to technical (inherent noise) and sample-associated variability in WES data. We present a novel computational framework, ENVE, which models inherent noise in any WES dataset, enabling robust detection of sCNAs across WES platforms. ENVE achieved high concordance with orthogonal sCNA assessments across two colorectal cancer (CRC) WES datasets, and consistently outperformed a best-in-class algorithm, Control-FREEC. We subsequently used ENVE to characterize global sCNA landscapes in African American CRCs, identifying genomic aberrations potentially associated with CRC pathogenesis in this population.

                "Human cancer is caused in part by structural changes resulting in DNA copy-number alterations at distinct locations in the tumor genome. Identification of such somatic copy-number alterations (sCNA) in tumor tissues has contributed significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis and to the expansion of therapeutic avenues across multiple cancers [1\u20134]. Traditionally, sCNAs have been detected using cytogenetic techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization [5], and representational oligonucleotide microarrays [6] as well as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays [7]. However, each of the above techniques has limitations with regard to the number, resolution, and platform-specific assessability of regions that can be interrogated in the genome.",
                "More recently, massively parallel sequencing technologies have provided the unique opportunity to comprehensively characterize genome-scale DNA alterations in tumor tissues. In particular, whole-exome sequencing (WES) offers a cost-effective way of interrogating mutation and copy-number profiles within protein-coding regions in the tumor genome. This has resulted in the increasing use of WES in both the research [8, 9] and clinical settings [10, 11]. However, variability in tumor content among clinical samples in addition to the random technical variability in DNA library enrichment steps during WES can potentially introduce systematic biases across the genome, thus making sCNA detection relatively challenging. Although quite a few algorithmic approaches have been developed to address these issues [12\u201318], a recent comprehensive review [19] of these published methodologies, primarily using simulated data, showed substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity across algorithms, with algorithm-specific parameter choice a key confounder of algorithm performance. This poses a significant challenge in reliably detecting sCNAs in WES data because choosing the right parameter for a given application is non-trivial. There is therefore a pressing need to develop relatively parameter-free and robust methodologies for detecting these sCNAs across diverse tumor types and sequencing platforms.",
                "Here we present a novel computational methodology, ENVE (Extreme Value Distribution Based Somatic Copy-Number Variation Estimation), which robustly detects tumor-specific copy-number alterations in massively parallel DNA sequencing data without the need for complex parameter choices or user intervention. We demonstrate the robustness of ENVE\u2019s performance in two independent matched tumor/normal WES datasets (total N = 107), derived from Caucasian and African American (AA) colorectal cancers (CRC), by comparing ENVE-based sCNA calls in WES data against SNP arrays and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-based sCNA assessments performed on the same sample sets. We further show ENVE as significantly and consistently outperforming the best-in-class sCNA detection algorithm, Control-FREEC [12, 19], in these analyses. We additionally demonstrate the reproducibility of ENVE\u2019s key noise-modeling feature using an independent WES dataset derived from 54 normal diploid samples. Finally, using the ENVE framework, we characterize, for the first time, global sCNA landscapes in colon cancers arising in AA patients, identifying genomic aberrations potentially associated with colon carcinogenesis in this population."

Target sequence enrichments were performed using the Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, sample DNA was quantified using a PicoGreen fluorometric assay, and 3 \u03bcg of genomic DNA was randomly sheared to an average size of 300 bp using a Covaris S2 sonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Sonicated DNA was then end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated with indexed paired-end Illumina adapters. Target capture was performed on DNA pooled from six indexed samples, following which the captured library was PCR amplified for ten cycles to enrich for target genomic regions. The captured libraries were precisely quantified using a qPCR-based Kapa Biosystems Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) on a Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Deep sequencing of the capture enriched DNA pools was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to generate 100-bp paired-end reads, and to achieve an average read depth of ~70\u00d7 per tumor sample and ~50\u00d7 per matched normal sample. A Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner version 0.6.1-r104 [22] algorithm [23] was used to align individual 100-bp reads from the raw FASTQ files to the human reference genome (build hg19). Following the conversion of aligned reads in to Binary Sequence Alignment/Map (BAM) format and subsequent removal of duplicated reads, coverage metrics of target bases were calculated using the Picard tools version 1.41 [24]. On average, Picard metrics showed ~69 % of the target bases covered at 20\u00d7 read depth for the normal samples and ~86 % of the target bases covered at 20\u00d7 read depth for the tumors."

Because chromosomal coverage tends to be more complete and randomly distributed at lower Absolute LogRatio Thresholds (as expected with random inherent noise) for both positive and negative deviations, as opposed to the sparse and focal coverage observed at higher Absolute LogRatio Thresholds (as expected with germline CNVs), ENVE Module 1c employs a robust quantitative approach to differentiate between inherent noise and germline CNVs in the normal\u2013normal comparisons (ENVE Module 1c, Fig.\u00a01). Each chromosome is first divided into non-overlapping 10-kb windows. Subsequently, the frequency of segmental coverage within each chromosomal window is calculated using segments with absolute LogRatios at or above Absolute LogRatio Threshold (RT), with RT varying from 0 to 1 (RTmax) in steps of 0.05. Let FRT be the vector containing the frequencies of segmental coverage \\(\\left( f_{j}^{R_{T}} \\right)\\)  for all the windows in a chromosome at a particular RT. The fraction of chromosomal coverage at a particular RT is therefore the ratio of non-zero entries in \\(F^{R_{T}}\\)  to the length of \\(F^{R_{T}}\\)  for a given chromosome. Next, the entropy of chromosomal coverage, for given a chromosome, at each RT is given as:\\(E_{R_{T}}\\mspace{9mu} = \\mspace{9mu} - \\mspace{9mu}\\sum\\limits_{\\forall j}f_{j}^{R_{T}}*\\log_{2}\\left( f_{j}^{R_{T}} \\right)\\)",
                                "RTF is defined as the RT associated with the maximal drop in fraction of chromosomal coverage and RTE is defined as the RT associated with the first major loss in entropy of chromosomal coverage per chromosome. The maximum of RTF and RTE corresponds to the noise threshold (RNT), above which we expect to see focal alterations associated with germline CNVs, and below which we expect to see variations associated with random inherent noise. The average silhouette index [31] ascertains whether the pairwise distances between \\(F^{R_{T}}\\)  vectors across RNT are substantially different from the pairwise distances between \\(F^{R_{T}}\\)  vectors within all RT above or below RNT. Positive silhouette index values close to 1 suggest that the chromosome-specific noise thresholds (RNT) appropriately capture the variability associated with inherent noise.",
                                "Accordingly, we employed the above measures in ENVE Module 1c on the 435 AA and TCGA normal\u2013normal comparisons, obtaining chromosome-specific noise thresholds (Figs.\u00a02b,c and 3b,c; Additional file 2: Figures S1 and S2). These chromosome-specific noise thresholds exhibited high positive silhouette indices (\u22650.8) in both the AA and TCGA normal\u2013normal comparisons, indicating that the focal copy-number altered segments observed above the noise thresholds are qualitatively distinct from the random distribution of segments below the noise thresholds.",
                                "To further ascertain that these discrete focal alterations in genomic segments observed above the noise thresholds in the normal\u2013normal data are indicative of germline CNVs prevalent among the normal samples, we repeated the analysis of ENVE Modules 1a-c (Fig.\u00a01) by replacing the normal\u2013normal comparisons with corresponding matched tumor\u2013tumor comparisons for both the AA and TCGA CRC datasets, assuming that any likely germline CNV should also be detectable in the matched tumor samples. We next identified the genomic regions from the matched tumor\u2013tumor comparisons overlapping the genomic segments falling above the noise thresholds in the normal\u2013normal comparisons (Figs.\u00a02b,c and 3b,c). Intriguingly, despite the potential confounding effects of somatic alterations as well as platform-associated noise in these tumor samples, we found that segments with LogRatios above the noise thresholds in the normal\u2013normal comparisons exhibited significantly higher correlation with their matched tumor\u2013tumor counterparts in both the AA CRC (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.39; Fig.\u00a04a) and TCGA CRC (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.36; Fig.\u00a04b) datasets, as compared to randomly selected tumor\u2013tumor comparisons that showed virtually no correlation (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.008 in AA CRC, Fig.\u00a04a; Pearson\u2019s r = 0.005 in TCGA CRC, Fig.\u00a04b). However, segments with LogRatios below the noise thresholds in the normal\u2013normal comparisons exhibited almost no correlation with either their matched tumor\u2013tumor counterparts (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.03 in AA CRC; Pearson\u2019s r = 0.07 in TCGA CRC) or randomly selected tumor\u2013tumor comparisons (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.001 in AA CRC, Fig.\u00a04a; Pearson\u2019s r = 0.000 in TCGA CRC, Fig.\u00a04b).Fig. 4Ability of ENVE in distinguishing germline copy-number variation from random inherent noise. Segments falling above or below the estimated noise thresholds in normal\u2013normal comparisons are evaluated against segments that overlap with the corresponding genomic regions from tumor\u2013tumor comparisons in AA CRC (a) and TCGA CRC WES (b) datasets. Shown are the Pearson correlation coefficients comparing normal\u2013normal segmental LogRatios with corresponding matched tumor\u2013tumor or random tumor\u2013tumor segmental LogRatios. Note the genomic segments in normal\u2013normal comparisons falling above noise thresholds show higher correlation with segments in corresponding matched tumor\u2013tumor comparisons than with segments in random tumor\u2013tumor comparisons. By contrast, genomic segments in normal\u2013normal comparisons that fall below noise thresholds show no correlation with either matched or random tumor\u2013tumor comparisons",
                                "Taken together, these findings in two independent WES datasets strongly indicate that the focal copy-number altered segments falling above the noise thresholds are more likely to be associated with germline CNVs, whereas the randomly distributed segments falling below the noise thresholds are indicative of inherent noise in WES data. Additionally, we note that the focal genomic segments with high LogRatios above noise thresholds within each chromosome were repeatedly observed across multiple unique normal sample pair comparisons in both the AA and TCGA CRC datasets, providing further evidence of their being indicative of germline CNVs as opposed to random inherent noise. Importantly, the observed differences in chromosome-specific noise-threshold values in AA versus TCGA CRC datasets (Figs.\u00a01 and 2) further highlight ENVE\u2019s ability to model noise in a platform- and sample-agnostic manner."

First, copy-number altered segments falling below the noise thresholds in the normal\u2013normal comparisons (Figs.\u00a02 and 3) are selected for noise modeling. Assuming X1, X2, \u2026 Xn to be the segmental LogRatios of selected copy-number altered segments within the normal\u2013normal comparisons, the Fisher\u2013Tippett theorem [32] states that the distribution of Mn\u2009=\u2009max{X1,\u2009X2,\u2009\u2026,\u2009Xn} converges to (as\u2002n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u221e) the GEV distribution:\\(G(y) = \\mathit{\\exp}\\left( {- \\left\\lbrack {1 + \\xi\\left( \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)} \\right\\rbrack^{- 1/\\xi}} \\right)\\)",

Because the only requirement for the GEV distribution is that the segmental LogRatios, Xi, are independent and identically distributed random variables, the tails of whose distributions can have either an exponential or polynomial decay, we modeled the maxima of the segmental LogRatios using the GEV. Also, because the variability in segmental LogRatio estimates is likely to be chromosome-specific, reflecting variations in gene density and capture efficiency across regions, separate GEV model parameters are inferred for respective chromosomes. Furthermore, because somatic copy-number deletion events can only fall into two categories (heterozygous or homozygous deletions), as opposed to the copy-number amplifications, separate GEV parameters for positive and negative deviations are estimated, respectively, using the probability weighted moment method [32]. Accordingly, per chromosome, the maximum segmental LogRatio values associated with positive deviations within each of the K normal\u2013normal comparisons, resulting in K maxima, are used to estimate the GEV parameters to evaluate somatic copy-number amplifications. Similarly, the minimum segmental LogRatio values associated with negative deviations within a chromosome for each of the K normal\u2013normal comparisons, resulting in K minima, are used to estimate the GEV parameters to evaluate somatic copy-number deletions. The R package fExtremes (R package version 3010.81) is used to estimate the above GEV parameters.",

Although there exists no gold-standard technique for use as a comparator in formal evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of sCNA calls in stromal-admixed clinical tumor samples, we nevertheless proceeded to evaluate ENVE\u2019s performance by comparing against widely used SNP arrays.",
                        "Accordingly, we performed SNP array-based sCNA detection in both the AA CRC and TCGA CRC datasets. For the TCGA CRC dataset, we obtained SNP array-based sCNA calls for all of the 77 tumors included in our WES study from the TCGA portal (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Similarly, for the AA CRC dataset, we obtained SNP array sCNA calls in 12 of the 30 AA CRC samples used in our WES study (see \u201cMethods\u201d). As an additional key comparator, we evaluated another algorithm, Control-FREEC [12], which has been reported to outperform published WES-based sCNA detection algorithms in a comprehensive review [19]. We performed sCNA detection on the two WES datasets using Control-FREEC\u2019s recommended parameters (see \u201cMethods\u201d), and subsequently compared the ENVE-based and Control-FREEC-based sCNA calls in each of the AA CRC and TCGA CRC samples, individually, with those detected by the SNP arrays. We anchored the comparison to only within gene-coding regions because SNP arrays also span substantial non-coding regions that are not interrogated by the WES platform. Because SNP arrays are also not a gold-standard technique for evaluating sensitivity and specificity, we instead assessed the concordance between the SNP arrays and the respective ENVE and Control-FREEC algorithms. Specifically, as shown in Additional file 2: Figure S3, the percent concordance between SNP arrays and ENVE/Control-FREEC was calculated as the ratio of the total length of all concordant exonic sCNA regions called by the WES algorithm to the total length of the exonic SNP array sCNA regions.",
                        "Figure\u00a05a shows the median number of genes associated with sCNA regions in AA and TCGA CRC WES datasets, as detected by ENVE and Control-FREEC, along with their concordance with SNP array-based estimates. For regions with copy-number amplifications, ENVE achieved a higher concordance with SNP arrays than Control-FREEC both in the AA CRC (97.32 % vs. 87.26 %) and TCGA CRC (97.68 % vs. 89.27 %) datasets, despite Control-FREEC calling on average 30 % more amplification events than ENVE in both WES datasets (Fig.\u00a05b). This strongly implies that ENVE has higher sensitivity and specificity in calling copy-number amplifications than Control-FREEC. Similarly, for regions with copy-number deletions, ENVE achieved a higher concordance rate with SNP arrays (Fig.\u00a05a) than Control-FREEC both in the AA CRC (90.6 % vs. 47.68 %) and TCGA CRC datasets (78.22 % vs. 67.03 %), with Control-FREEC calling on average 16 % more deletion events than ENVE across samples in the TCGA CRC dataset (Fig.\u00a05b). Noting the extremely poor performance of Control-FREEC in identifying deletion events, especially in the AA CRC WES dataset, we proceeded to evaluate whether its performance could be improved by enabling Control-FREEC to infer and adjust for potential stromal admixture and tumor content in the two WES datasets. In this mode, we found Control-FREEC called on average 55 % more copy-number altered events than ENVE, but did not match ENVE\u2019s sensitivity in detecting sCNAs in three of the four comparisons across the AA and TCGA WES datasets (Additional file 2: Figure S4A,B). Moreover, ENVE consistently showed better performance than Control-FREEC when tested across different Segment-Mean cutoff values that were used for classifying sCNAs in the TCGA SNP array dataset (Additional file 2: Figure S5), or at low overall read depth simulated scenarios (Additional file 2: Figure S6). Taken together, these results strongly point to the potentially high sensitivity and specificity of the ENVE framework in detecting sCNAs in WES data.Fig. 5SNP array-based performance estimates of ENVE and Control-FREEC in detecting sCNAs in tumors. a Median number of genes with sCNAs, as detected by ENVE and Control-FREEC in the WES data, along with their median percent concordance with SNP array-based sCNA calls. b Number of genes with sCNAs (Y-axis) in each sample (X-axis), as detected by ENVE (blue) and Control-FREEC (red), in AA and TCGA CRC WES datasets. Significant sCNAs as detected by the Partek Suite were used for comparison in AA CRCs, while for TCGA CRCs SNP array segments with Segment-Mean cutoffs of \u00b10.5 were used for comparison",
                        "In addition to the above SNP array-based comparative analysis, we also evaluated ENVE\u2019s performance by using a second orthogonal platform, qPCR. Accordingly, we designed a custom qPCR copy-number array containing a set of 11 genes, each representing a distinct genomic locus that showed recurrent sCNAs (frequency \u2265 30 %) among the 30 AA CRC cases in the WES dataset, as detected by ENVE (Additional file 1: Table S2). Using this qPCR array, we estimated sCNAs in a subset of AA CRC cases (N = 6), where each of the cancers showed copy-number alteration in at least one of the 11 genes (Fig.\u00a06a). Of note, these six cases were not represented in the 12 samples used for the SNP array analysis, thus allowing for an independent evaluation of ENVE\u2019s performance. Respective matched normal samples from these six cancers, along with an additional six AA normal samples, were used as diploid genome controls in the qPCR analysis. We again used the WES-based sCNA calls from Control-FREEC for these six CRC cases as an additional key comparator in this analysis. Comparison of amplifications, deletions, and copy-neutral calls between qPCR and ENVE showed a significantly higher overall concordance of 72.72 % (Chi-square P = 0.049, Fig.\u00a06b) compared to the 59 % concordance observed between qPCR and Control-FREEC (Additional file 2: Figure S7). Notably, 54 % of the qPCR and ENVE concordant alterations exhibited low tumor/normal LogRatios ranging between \u22121 and 0.7 in the WES data (Fig.\u00a06a), likely suggesting that the higher performance of ENVE compared to Control-FREEC results from ENVE\u2019s ability to detect sCNAs even at low tumor/normal read depth ratios in these stromal-admixed tumor samples. It is important to note that although the genes and samples selected for this comparison were chosen based on ENVE\u2019s output, we had no a priori expectation of the qPCR results, thus allowing for a fair comparison with Control-FREEC.Fig. 6Concordance analysis of ENVE-based and qPCR-based sCNA estimates. a Matched tumor/normal (T/N) LogRatios derived from WES data (above) and corresponding qPCR-based copy-number (CN) estimates (below) for 11 genes in each of the six AA CRC cases.

                "We have developed a robust and unbiased method for detecting somatic copy-number alterations using WES data. Performance evaluation of ENVE in two independent WES tumor tissue datasets showed a high concordance between ENVE and SNP array and qPCR-based sCNA estimates (Figs.\u00a05 and 6). In addition, we found ENVE significantly and consistently outperformed the best-in-class published WES-based sCNA detection algorithm [19], Control-FREEC [12] (Figs.\u00a05 and 6, Additional file 2: Figures S4\u2013S7). More importantly, our performance evaluations strongly indicate that ENVE has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting sCNAs from WES data derived from stromal-admixed tumor samples. In particular, our comparative analyses reveal the effectiveness of ENVE in detecting genuine sCNAs even at low tumor/normal segmental LogRatios (\u22121 to 0.7) (Fig.\u00a06a), strongly underscoring the drawbacks with using pre-defined LogRatio value cutoffs to identify sCNAs in tumors. In fact, examination of the relationship between the LogRatios of individual segments and ENVE-based P-values (Additional file 2: Figure S8) shows that no single segmental LogRatio-cutoff value would have captured all recurrent copy-number amplifications or deletions in either the AA or TCGA CRC WES datasets. Besides, the commonly observed variability in cancer cell content among clinical specimens would preclude the use of a single LogRatio-cutoff value for determining recurrent sCNAs. Although some published copy-number algorithms have attempted to overcome the challenge of defining LogRatio-cutoffs by inferring the tumor content and ploidy of each sample to estimate the absolute tumor copy-number [16, 18, 40, 41], these estimates are often unstable, with these algorithms differing in their underlying assumptions, which may not always correspond to the complex chromosomal architecture in tumors [42]. Our approach, in contrast, does not infer tumor content or ploidy, but provides a probabilistic estimate of the presence of sCNAs in tumors given the inherent noise in WES measurements as estimated from non-malignant normal diploid samples, and therefore offers a simpler and robust alternative.",
                "Because one of the key characteristics of ENVE is the use of normal diploid samples for capturing inherent noise associated with WES data, we used DNA samples derived from 54 immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patients\u2019 peripheral blood lymphocytes to determine whether noise threshold estimates are sensitive to the number of normal diploid samples used for noise assessment. We estimated chromosome-specific noise thresholds using normal\u2013normal comparisons derived from random groups of 16\u201354 samples in increments of 2, repeated ten times. We found the ENVE estimates of noise thresholds across chromosomes to be nearly all stable with respect to the number of diploid samples used for the estimation (Additional file 2: Figure S9). Although the chromosome-specific noise thresholds are not sensitive to the number of diploid samples being used, reliable estimation of the parameters of the GEV distribution requires 100\u2013150 extreme values [43], corresponding to a lower acceptable limit of 15\u201320 normal diploid samples. Therefore, we suggest that using 15\u201320 normal samples is sufficient to model the inherent noise in WES data, and as such is computationally efficient. We therefore anticipate that ENVE\u2019s key feature involving modeling of inherent noise in WES data will enable its broad application across studies, where population-matched and platform-matched normal diploid DNA samples are frequently available.",
                "Foreseeing a likely practical situation where a normal sample matching the tumor may not be available from the patient, we further evaluated the performance of ENVE in a simulated circumstance where each of the tumor samples was compared to a pooled set of normal samples derived from the WES data. This analysis was performed using computationally derived pooled normal samples for both the AA CRC WES and SNP array datasets (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Next, we compared the ENVE sCNA calls with SNP array-based sCNA calls in the same 12 AA CRC cases from above (Fig.\u00a05). Notably, in this pooled analysis (Additional file 2: Figure S10), ENVE exhibited high concordance rates with the SNP array calls for both amplifications (97.72 %) and deletions (92.86 %), as compared to the matched normal analysis, further suggesting that ENVE remains a viable methodology for reliably detecting sCNAs in tumors even in the absence of a matched normal sample.",
                "We note that one of the limitations of published algorithms [12\u201318] is their exclusive applicability to deep-sequencing data derived from fresh-frozen material but not archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biospecimens. While sequencing of archived FFPE DNA allows for de novo characterization of gene mutations, as shown by us and others [11, 44], estimation of copy-number alterations using WES of FFPE specimens remains challenging owing to poor DNA quality in archived FFPE tumor samples. This, in turn, may result in enhanced inherent noise, which may also be prevalent in FFPE-derived normal diploid DNA samples. We have not assessed the performance of ENVE in archival FFPE samples, but we anticipate that ENVE\u2019s noise-modeling feature may reliably capture the degree of inherent noise in FFPE samples, thus potentially enabling use of the extensive clinically annotated tumor samples held in pathology archives.",
                "One potential limitation of ENVE is that, while it models sources of inherent noise in WES data, it does not explicitly model the likely occurrences of genomic complexities, such as aneuploidy and hyperploidy, in the tumors. This may possibly influence the true positive/negative sCNA detection rates of the current ENVE framework. However, estimating allele frequencies in addition to LogRatios from WES data is a conceivable extension to the current ENVE framework, and may address the influence of such aberrations. Another likely limitation of ENVE is the requirement of at least 15\u201320 platform-matched normal samples in order to capture and model the inherent noise in WES data. However, because most cancer-profiling studies are designed to include the collection of platform-matched normal samples (matched/unmatched with the tumors), this limitation is likely not burdensome. More importantly, we note that the ENVE\u2019s unique noise-modeling feature, not included in any of the other published sCNA detection algorithms, provides detailed and otherwise unavailable comprehension of the inherent noise in any given WES dataset to the user (Figs.\u00a01b,c and 2b,c), thus allowing for reliable interrogation of sCNAs in the tumor samples in a platform-agnostic manner."

                "We present ENVE as a robust method for detecting sCNAs in WES-based studies using either matched or unmatched tumor/normal samples, without the need for complex parameter choices or extensive user intervention. In particular, ENVE reliably detects sCNAs in stromal-admixed tumor samples and is therefore expected to be broadly applicable across cancer-profiling studies. We believe this user-friendly methodology should be portable to any massively parallel DNA sequencing platform."
