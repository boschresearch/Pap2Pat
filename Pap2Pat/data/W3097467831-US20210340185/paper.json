    "abstract": "The humoral responses of Ebola virus (EBOV) survivors mainly target the surface glycoprotein GP, and anti-GP neutralizing antibodies have been associated with protection against EBOV infection. In order to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies through vaccination a native-like conformation of the antigen is required. We therefore engineered and expressed in CHO cells several GP variants from EBOV (species Zaire ebolavirus, Mayinga variant), including a soluble GP \u0394TM, a mucin-like domain-deleted GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC, as well as two GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC variants with C-terminal trimerization motifs in order to favour their native trimeric conformation. Inclusion of the trimerization motives resulted in proteins mimicking GP metastable trimer and showing increased stability. The mucin-like domain appeared not to be critical for the retention of the native conformation of the GP protein, and its removal unmasked several neutralizing epitopes, especially in the trimers. The soluble GP variants inhibited mAbs neutralizing activity in a pseudotype transduction assay, further confirming the proteins\u2019 structural integrity. Interestingly, the trimeric GPs, a native-like GP complex, showed stronger affinity for antibodies raised by natural infection in Ebola virus disease survivors rather than for antibodies raised in volunteers that received the ChAd3-EBOZ vaccine. These results support our hypothesis that neutralizing antibodies are preferentially induced when using a native-like conformation of the GP antigen. The soluble trimeric recombinant GP proteins we developed represent a novel and promising strategy to develop prophylactic vaccines against EBOV and other filoviruses.",

                "The Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) epidemic occurring in Democratic Republic of Congo has been declared, with an overall case-fatality ratio of 66%, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in July 2019 (1). The recently licensed vaccine against Ebola is based on a live-attenuated recombinant rVSV expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP), it is recognized to be safe and highly efficacious after a single-dose injection, and it is currently being adopted in the field in a ring-vaccination strategy with the aim to contain the spread of the epidemic (2, 3). Recombinant viral vectors have been identified as promising strategies for inducing an anti-EBOV immune response due to their ability to induce potent insert-specific cellular immunity and high levels of antibodies (4). However, vector-based vaccines present major limitations, including the induction and/or pre-existence of anti-vector neutralizing antibodies, which may hamper vaccine\u2019s clinical use (5). Moreover, the restricted use of replicating vaccine platforms like rVSV in target populations where immunosuppressive conditions or co-morbidities (e.g., HIV, TB, and malaria) are common and the need for a strict cold chain storage and transport at \u221280\u00b0C to ensure vaccine stability and biological activity make these vaccines less suitable for large-scale vaccination in sub-Saharan countries.",
                "All current vaccine candidates target the surface EBOV GP, which is the only protein expressed on the virus surface and plays a critical role in EBOV infection (6). EBOV GP is a type I transmembrane protein of 676 amino acids. It is post-translationally cleaved by furin into two subunits (GP1 and GP2) linked by a disulphide bond, and is inserted into the viral membrane. While GP1 mediates attachment to host cells, GP2 is the responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In the EBOV surface, GP assembles into a trimer of GP1-2 heterodimers that are highly glycosylated and adopt a chalice-like shape. The glycosylation occurs in the mucin-like domains of each monomer, and forms a shield protecting the virus from antibody recognition (6). Humoral responses of EVD epidemic survivors mainly target the GP protein, and anti-GP neutralizing antibodies have been associated with protection against EBOV infection (7\u201311). Notably, neutralizing mAbs have shown stronger binding to the GP protein in the absence of the mucin-like domain (12, 13) suggesting that its removal could reveal critical epitopes.",
                "A panel of human neutralizing antibodies directed against EBOV GP has been isolated from donors that recovered from EVD, including KZ52 (14), mAb100, and mAb114 (12, 15). The majority of these mAbs show neutralizing activity when administered in combination (16), highlighting the importance of targeting multiple GP epitopes for complete efficacy (17). Despite their proved efficacy, mAb-based treatments have raised concerns in terms of susceptibility to re-infection of the treated survivors (10). The ideal alternative to mAb therapies is represented by the possibility of eliciting neutralizing antibodies in vivo through immunization with a highly characterized protein adopting a native-like conformation.",
                "Based on these observations, we propose a native-like recombinant GP protein complex as a promising antigen in order to develop a prophylactic vaccine able to elicit protective/neutralizing antibodies against EBOV infection."

In addition, the \u201cmucin\u201d region of the protein (\u201c\u0394MUC\u201d) was deleted in three out of four constructs. The furin-cleavage site was left untouched, since it was assumed that the intracellular cleavage at this position is an essential step in the appropriate folding of the GP protein complex. The \u201cT4\u201d and \u201cGCN4\u201d labelled constructs contain short stretches of additional DNA sequences which were expected to facilitate the assembly of monomeric GP units into trimeric structures. If trimerized as soluble molecule complexes, such a structure would more closely mimic the structure of GP as they are presented on the surface of the EBOV. The T4 and GCN4 sequences are naturally derived protein sequences (19, 20). DNA constructs used for transfection contained \u201cHis-tag\u201d encoding DNA, which was inserted to facilitate the downstream purification strategy. Purification was done after clarification and cell removal by buffer exchange and chromatography using a GE Healthcare HiScreen\u2122 NiFF column for His-tagged proteins, following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for use."

The determination of the absolute molecular weight of the four GP variants provided the analytical evidence that inclusion of the T4 or GCN4 trimerization domains at the C-terminus of the GP sequence drove the trimerization of the GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC monomer (peak 2) in CHO cells ( Table 1  and  Figure S2 ). GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC peak 1 likely represent the formation of a dimer or an incomplete trimer. Notably, the peak of GP \u0394TM has double the size of GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC monomer (peak 2), which is consistent with the mucin-like domain contributing for almost half the mass of the GP protein (28, 29).",
                        "The secondary structure profiles of the four GP proteins displayed a spectral signature typical of a \u03b1-helical secondary structure, with double minima at 208 and 222 nm, the former being less evident because of the contribution of \u03b2-sheets present in the head of the protein ( Figure 3 ). The percentage contribution of each secondary structure was also calculated using BestSel algorithm and results are reported in  Table S1 . The CD profiles of the four GP proteins are consistent with the \u03b1-helical bundle motifs typical of class I transmembrane envelope viral GPs that is used to drive fusion of viral and host membranes (30). Interestingly, the two trimeric proteins exhibited a stronger contribution of the \u03b1-helical secondary structure with respect to the monomers, which is due to the insertion of the trimerization motifs favoring the formation of the \u03b1-helical coiled coil. Changes in secondary structures of proteins at different temperatures were also investigated. GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-T4 and GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-GCN4 appeared to be stable up to 75\u00b0C and showed the lowest impact in structural changes at the various temperatures tested ( Figure 3 ), confirming that the stability of the soluble GP protein is enhanced by the addition of T4 or GCN4 sequences."

                        "The screening and immunological profiling of the designed immunogens were carried out by ELISA in order to assess the recognition of critical neutralizing epitopes. Our aim was to confirm the structural integrity of the produced proteins and their ability to be recognized by monoclonal antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes including KZ52 (14), and a panel of murine neutralizing mAbs produced in-house. In order to minimize the impact on protein structures introduced by adsorption to the ELISA plate, the immunological profiling of the recombinant proteins was performed in a sandwich ELISA configuration, using a chimeric version of mAb KZ52 produced in rabbit as capture antibody. Surprisingly, signal was detected with the antibody pair rabbit KZ52/human KZ52 for all the tested mucin-deleted constructs ( Figure 4 ). Since the epitope recognized by KZ52 is known to be located in the GP protomer (6), this was identified as an indirect proof of the ability of the GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC to rearrange in a dimeric, if not trimeric, conformation when in solution (as noticed also in  Figure 2  and  Table 1 ). The reactivity of trimers in this assay was significantly higher than that of the two monomeric molecules. Considering that KZ52 epitope is located in the GP promoter and bridges both GP1 and GP2 subunits, we could hypothesize that our monomeric recombinant GPs do not express this epitope in its right conformation and that the epitope might be covered by the mucin-like domain in GP \u0394TM.",
                        "We extended the immunological profiling of the antigens using a panel of four conformational mouse mAbs produced in house and already tested for the recognition of pseudotypes expressing ZEBOV GP \u0394MUC in an in vitro neutralization assay. Among these mAbs, listed in the graph of  Figure 4 , EZP01S, EZP16S, and EZP35S were known for their in vitro neutralizing activity, with PRNT50 of 6.9, 2.7, and 2.4 \u00b5g/ml\u22121, respectively. Overall, the mucin-deleted versions of the protein were recognized with higher efficiency by all the tested mAbs, confirming the initial hypothesis of the mucin-like domain to act in limiting access of mAbs to their corresponding epitopes. Remarkably, the immunological profiling of the engineered variants showed an increased breadth of reactivity with this panel of mAbs. This increase is particularly evident for mAbs KZ52, EZP01S, and EZP35S. These three antibodies are probably quaternary specific and have more affinity for their respective epitopes when the protein is in the trimeric conformation.",
                        "The effect of the EBOV GP variants in inhibiting the neutralizing activity of mAbs in a transduction assay was assessed on a murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral pseudotype platform. The principle of the test was to evaluate the ability of mAbs to neutralize the transduction of cells made by pseudoviruses expressing the ZEBOV GP \u0394MUC. We tested if our recombinant GPs could be recognized by neutralizing mAbs thus preventing/avoiding their inhibition activity on the transduction assay. To answer this question, neutralizing antibodies EZP01S, EZP16S, and EZP35S were tested at two different concentrations (1 and 10 \u00b5g ml\u22121), corresponding to an 80% and 0% of transduced cells in the pseudotype assay, against various concentrations of recombinant GPs. As indicated from the left panels in  Figure 5 , mAbs at the lowest concentrations captured the soluble EBOV GPs leading to a 100% cells transduction by pseudotypes. The main differences are evident in the right panels with the highest mAb concentrations. In this case, mAbs EZP01S and EZP35S showed to be equally sensitive to GP monomers and trimers, suggesting that the recognized epitope is similarly accessible in both protein conformations. On the other hand, mAb EZP16S recognizes an epitope that is highly accessible in the trimers, and probably covered by the mucin-like domain given the fact that in presence of the GP \u0394TM monomer cell transduction is completely inhibited ( Figure 5 ). This experiment presented us with an outcome that is opposite from what shown in  Figure 4  where binding of EZP01S and EZP35S was more likely to happen with trimers rather than with monomeric GP, and EZP16S was similarly sensitive to monomers and trimers. However, such comparison is biased by the different kinetic of the two experiments. In ELISA, the binding is happening over an array of coated antibodies that force the GP in a less natural position. On the contrary, in the transduction assay the GP protein is expressed over the surface of pseudoviruses thus being more exposed and accessible to mAbs similarly to what happens in vivo."

A panel of 10 sera from ChAd3-EboZ trial volunteers (18) was tested in a direct ELISA against the recombinant GPs and the antibody responses were compared with responses of a panel of 10 EVD survivors ( Figure 6 ). The GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-T4 protein was best recognized by sera from both volunteers and survivors. The two sera panels were also compared in a competition ELISA against various concentrations of the monomer GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC or the corresponding T4 and GCN4 trimers ( Figure 7 ). Since the panel of survivors showed a higher affinity for T4 trimers, we identified this protein as a most promising antigen candidate for an EBOV GP-based vaccine, even though proper candidate selection should require recombinant GPs to be tested in further pre-clinical studies."

                "Currently, viral vector-based vaccines lead vaccine research against EVD and the amount of published work focusing on preclinical and clinical studies using recombinant EBOV GP proteins is limited and mainly based on protein production in insect cells (31\u201333). A recent publication from Rutten and colleagues (34) described the successful insertion of stabilizing mutations for the expression of stabilized GP trimers in human cells. In the present study we instead followed the structure-based approach that led to recent advances in vaccine development for two distinct pathogens, RSV and HIV, which have yielded promising results in terms of induction of neutralizing antibodies when the relevant surface GPs were engineered to present a native-like pre-fusion conformation (35\u201337). Similar approaches were also applied for the production of EBOV GP trimers to be used mainly for structural biology studies aimed to investigate the formation of complexes between GP and neutralizing antibodies (12, 38) or other therapeutic molecules (26, 39). With these results as a proof-of-concept, we aimed at the production of a stabilized and soluble native-like EBOV GP trimer. Specifically, four variants of soluble ZEBOV GP proteins were engineered and secreted into the supernatant of bioreactors using highly efficient and proprietary technologies for transient and stable expression (40\u201345). For the first time to our knowledge, CHO cells were exploited for recombinant production of EBOV GP proteins, bringing many advantages such as high yield and the potential for large-scale operation in manufacturing. Moreover, mammalian cell culture systems and CHO cells in particular guarantee post-translational processing and a protein glycosylation machinery highly similar to that in human. We produced GP trimers retaining a stable native-like structure and recognized by virus neutralizing mAbs, even upon removal of the mucin-like domain. In CHO cells, the mucin-deleted constructs appeared to efficiently execute the furin proteolysis step that occurs in vivo, thus enhancing the presentation of conserved neutralizing epitopes implicated in receptor binding (33, 46), while removing epitopes located in the glycan cap and mucin-like domain that are mostly linear and non-neutralizing (47). Indeed, the performed experiments confirmed that the recombinant proteins were retaining the conformation of the epitope recognized by several neutralizing mAbs. In particular, the mucin-like domain appeared not to be critical for the retention of the native conformation of the GP protein, and its removal allowed unmasking of neutralizing epitopes. Protein engineering efforts to stabilize the formation of GP trimers were focused on the mucin-deleted version of GP because of this higher reactivity with all the antibodies tested. Globally, the strong biochemical and immunological profiling carried out on vaccine candidates presented here strongly supports the importance of native-like antigen conformation for induction of neutralizing antibodies.",
                "The here produced and characterized native-like proteins will help to overcome problems inherent to virus vector-based vaccines offering additional opportunities to design novel and more efficacious clinical trials with prime-boost regimens for prophylactic vaccines against EBOV. Host pre-existing immunity is indeed the main limiting factor of vector-based vaccines, preventing their use in homologous prime-boost immunization strategies that would likely favor the induction of a stronger and extended protection. Also, considering that lately many viruses are being used as vaccine vectors, the heterologous prime-boost could easily lead to a shortage of available vector vaccine platforms. Multiple exposure to the same antigen would help to increase the durability of protection and the quality of induced antibodies.",
                "Antigens purity and homogeneity are fundamental in terms of safety and efficacy of the final vaccine product. In this perspective, vaccination with a recombinant protein allows the control and characterization of the conformation adopted by the antigen\u2014which is very difficult to determine in the current viral vector-based vaccine candidates\u2014thus representing a desired improvement in terms of safety. Furthermore, a pure and well-defined antigen facilitates the characterization studies of the induced immune response. Recombinant GP vaccines may be easier to produce at higher yields than virus-vector based vaccines, particularly if manufactured in an industrial host system such as CHO cells. Moreover, the remarkable structural and thermal stability demonstrated by our antigens is of fundamental interest in the process of candidate selection for future development of a vaccine intended to be deployed in third world countries.",
                "Nevertheless, we acknowledge that purified recombinant antigens are likely poorly immunogenic and proper adjuvants will be required to balance the removal of natural immune-stimulatory components of the pathogen with the aim to enhance an immune response similar to the one triggered by natural infection.",
                "In conclusion, the results discussed here demonstrate the possibility to obtain soluble EBOV GP trimeric constructs with superior antigenic profiles and the potential to be recognized as valuable antigen candidates for the development of an efficacious prophylactic EBOV vaccine. The possibility to produce a protein vaccine based on a native-like candidate highly recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and with high affinity for survivors-derived antibodies would confer a great advantage in terms of induction of protective antibodies through vaccination. For this reason, the trimeric soluble recombinant antigens presented here are currently being tested in pre-clinical animal models for immunogenicity and induction of neutralizing antibody responses."
