                        "The Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of Filoviridae family, which is highly contagious for human and non-human primates, and causes severe hemorrhagic fever associated with 50-90% human mortality [Lee, J E., et al. \u201cStructure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.\u201d Nature 454.7201 (2008): 177.]. Currently, there is no prophylactic or therapeutic EBOV approved for human usage. Conventional vaccine development approaches based on virus inactivation were shown to be ineffective [Marzi, A, and H Feldmann. \u201cEbola virus vaccines: an overview of current approaches.\u201d Expert review of vaccines 13.4 (2014): 521-531]. Among the 13 vaccine candidates in various development phases, the majority are based on recombinant viral vectors such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), and human or chimpanzee Adenovirus (Ad) [Ohimain, E I. \u201cRecent advances in the development of vaccines for Ebola virus disease.\u201d Virus research 211 (2016): 174-185.]. Recombinant viral vectors have been identified as promising for inducing an anti-EBPV immune response due to their ability to induce potent insert-specific cellular immunity and high levels of antibodies [Venkatraman, N, et al. \u201cVaccines against Ebola virus.\u201d Vaccine (2017).]. However, these vector-based vaccines against EBOV have been primarily developed in the course of an epidemic or to fight bioterrorism, and they present major limitations for human vaccination, including: I) induction and/or pre-existence of anti-vector neutralizing antibodies, which commonly limit the efficacy of the immune response induced by viral vaccines [McCoy, K, et al. \u201cEffect of preexisting immunity to adenovirus human serotype 5 antigens on the immune responses of nonhuman primates to vaccine regimens based on human- or chimpanzee-derived adenovirus vectors.\u201d Journal of virology 81.12 (2007): 6594-6604.]; II) restricted use of replicating vaccine platforms like rVSV in target populations where immunosuppressive conditions (e.g. HIV, TB, malaria) are common; Ill) need for a strict cold chain storage at \u221280\u00b0 C. to ensure vaccine stability and biological activity making these vaccines unsuitable for large-scale vaccination in sub-Saharan countries.",
                        "The majority of current vaccine candidates target the surface EBOV glycoprotein (GP), which is the only protein expressed on the virus surface and plays a critical role in EBOV infection [Lee, J E, et al. \u201cStructure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.\u201d Nature 454.7201 (2008): 177.]. Humoral responses of EBOV outbreaks survivors mainly target the GP protein, and anti-GP neutralizing antibodies have been associated with protection against EBOV infection [Rimoin, A W, et al. \u201cEbola Virus Neutralizing Antibodies Detectable in Survivors of the Yambuku, Zaire Outbreak 40 Years after Infection.\u201d The Journal of infectious diseases 217.2 (2017): 223-231.

Moreover, pre-clinical animal studies for Ebola GP vaccine efficacy have shown the induction of strong T-cell and humoral responses, as well as protection from in vitro/in vivo challenge [Stanley, D A., et al. \u201cChimpanzee adenovirus vaccine generates acute and durable protective immunity against ebolavirus challenge.\u201d Nature medicine 20.10 (2014): 1126.].",
                        "A panel of human neutralizing antibodies directed against Ebola GP has been isolated from donors that recovered from EBOV infection, among which KZ52 [Maruyama, T, et al. \u201cRecombinant human monoclonal antibodies to Ebola virus.\u201d The Journal of infectious diseases179.Supplement_1 (1999): S235-S239.], mAb100, and mAb114 [Corti, D, et al. \u201cProtective monotherapy against lethal Ebola virus infection by a potently neutralizing antibody.\u201d Science (2016): aad5224. Misasi, J, et al. \u201cStructural and molecular basis for Ebola virus neutralization by protective human antibodies.\u201d Science 351.6279 (2016): 1343-1346.]. Moreover, the passive transfer of purified IgG from survivors or the treatment with neutralizing mAb cocktails have been demonstrated to provide protection from viral infection [Dye, J M., et al. \u201cPostexposure antibody prophylaxis protects nonhuman primates from filovirus disease.\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109.13 (2012): 5034-5039.

Current post-exposure therapies are based on ZMapp, an optimized combination of three mAbs that was shown to rescue 100% of lethally infected nonhuman primates [Pettitt, J, et al. \u201cTherapeutic intervention of Ebola virus infection in rhesus macaques with the MB-003 monoclonal antibody cocktail.\u201d Science translational medicine 5.199 (2013): 199ra113-199ra113; Qiu, X, et al. \u201cSustained protection against Ebola virus infection following treatment of infected nonhuman primates with ZMAb.\u201d Scientific reports 3 (2013): 3365.

The epitopes recognized by each cocktail component have been recently mapped over the GP protein [Murin, C D., et al. \u201cStructures of protective antibodies reveal sites of vulnerability on Ebola virus.\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111.48 (2014): 17182-17187.].

Despite its proved efficacy, the ZMapp treatment has raised concerns in terms of susceptibility to re-infection of the treated survivors [Qiu, X, et al. \u201cReversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp.\u201d Nature 514.7520 (2014): 47.]."

                        "In the present disclosure, several variants of soluble and cell-secreted GP proteins, a total of 26 molecular variants, were engineered, including: a protein lacking the Transmembrane domain GP \u0394TM protein, a protein lacking the mucin-like domain GP \u0394MUC protein, a GP variant molecule with added trimerization motifs at the C-terminus and further variations and various combinations thereof. The variants were expressed using advanced methodologies combining superior expression vectors and gene transfer approaches for CHO cells combined with novel protein production approaches and using innovative bioreactors which are mixed by orbital shaking. [Matasci, M, et al. \u201cThe PiggyBac transposon enhances the frequency of CHO stable cell line generation and yields recombinant lines with superior productivity and stability.\u201d Biotechnology and bioengineering 108.9 (2011): 2141-2150; De Jesus, M, and F M Wurm. \u201cManufacturing recombinant proteins in kg-ton quantities using animal cells in bioreactors.\u201d European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 78.2 (2011): 184-188; Tissot, S, et al. \u201ckLa as a predictor for successful probe-independent mammalian cell bioprocesses in orbitally shaken bioreactors.\u201d New biotechnology 29.3 (2012): 387-394; Reclari et al, Phys.

These superior technologies allowed the rapid production of all desired variants of the Ebola GP in sufficient quantity and quality. Although vaccine research against Ebola disease is led by viral vector-based vaccines, some researchers have focused on the possibility to induce protection through the use of a recombinant GP protein. [Bengtsson et al., \u201cMatrix-M adjuvant enhances antibody, cellular and protective immune responses of a Zaire Ebola/Makona virus glycoprotein (GP) nanoparticle vaccine in mice.\u201d Vaccine 34.16 (2016): 1927-1935.] expressed a wild type full length Makona EBOV GP in insect cells with a recombinant baculovirus and entered a Phase I human clinical trial in response to the 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic. Other research groups proposed the mammalian cells expression to favor post-translational modifications and glycosylation [Konduru, K. et al. Against Lethal Challenge in Vaccinated Mice. 29, 2968-2977 (2012); Mellquist-Riemenschneider, J L., et al. \u201cComparison of the protective efficacy of DNA and baculovirus-derived protein vaccines for EBOLA virus in guinea pigs.\u201d Virus research 92.2 (2003): 187-193.]. However, such vaccine design was not further developed, likely due to the difficulty of producing enough material of a good quality recombinant GP protein. Through the approaches disclosed herein, high-yielding and high-quality GPs were produced in suspension adapted CHO cells, retaining near-native structures, and exposing critical neutralizing epitopes for binding to monoclonal and neutralizing antibodies, even upon removal of the mucin-like domain. In particular, the inclusion of a trimerization motif resulted in proteins showing the highest breadth of reactivity with several conformational and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.",

An immune response can be a B cell response, which results in the production of specific antibodies, such as antigen specific neutralizing antibodies. An immune response can also be a T cell response, such as a CD4+ response or a CD8+ response. B cell and T cell responses are aspects of a \u201ccellular\u201d immune response.

In some cases, the response is specific for a particular antigen (that is, an \u201cantigen-specific response\u201d). If the antigen is derived from a pathogen, the antigen-specific response is a \u201cpathogen-specific response.\u201d A \u201cprotective immune response\u201d is an immune response that inhibits a detrimental function or activity of a pathogen, reduces infection by a pathogen, or decreases symptoms (including death) that result from infection by the pathogen. A protective immune response can be measured, for example, by viral and immune assays using a serum sample from an immunized subject for testing the ability of serum antibodies for inhibition of viral replication, such as: plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), ELISA-neutralization assay, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). In addition, vaccine efficacy can be tested by measuring the T cell response CD4+ and CD8+ after immunization, using flow cytometry (FACS) analysis or ELISpot assay. The protective immune response can be tested by measuring resistance to pathogen challenge in vivo in an animal model. In humans, a protective immune response can be demonstrated in a population study, comparing measurements of infection, symptoms, morbidity, mortality, etc. in treated subjects compared to untreated controls. Exposure of a subject to an immunogenic stimulus, such as a pathogen or antigen (e.g., formulated as an antigenic composition or vaccine), elicits a primary immune response specific for the stimulus, that is, the exposure \u201cprimes\u201d the immune response. A subsequent exposure, e.g., by immunization, to the stimulus can increase or \u201cboost\u201d the magnitude (or duration, or both) of the specific immune response. Thus, \u201cboosting\u201d a preexisting immune response by administering an antigenic composition increases the magnitude of an antigen (or pathogen) specific response, (e.g., by increasing antibody titer and/or affinity, by increasing the frequency of antigen specific B or T cells, by inducing maturation effector function, or a combination thereof).",

In certain aspects, the immunogenic fragment is deleted for the transmembrane region and optionally the mucin-like domain as described herein. In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, the fragments range in size from 472-633 amino acids in length as monomers. After intracellular processing and removal of the signal peptide, these protein constructs are secreted to the cell culture supernatant as monomers with lengths of 453-614 amino acids (i.e., 19 amino acids shorter).",
                                "As disclosed herein, suitable proteins include precursor proteins, mature proteins, fragments, fusion proteins and peptides. In the compositions, the proteins may be present in the same form or as a mixture of these forms. For cellular production of a glycoprotein, a signal peptide may be part of the precursor protein. It may also be desirable to use a protein without a transmembrane or intracellular region or both.",

                                "Compositions that comprise at least one immunogenic fragment of an immunogenic EBOV GP polypeptide may be used as immunogens. In some embodiments, the immunogenic fragment is encoded by the recombinant expression vectors described herein. The immunogenic fragment may consist of at least 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 or more contiguous amino acids of an immunogenic polypeptide. The immunogenic fragment may comprise any number of contiguous amino acids between the aforementioned immunogenic polypeptide. The immunogenic fragments may comprise a sufficient number of contiguous amino acids that form a linear epitope and/or may comprise a sufficient number of contiguous amino acids that permit the fragment to fold in the same (or sufficiently similar) three-dimensional conformation as the full-length polypeptide from which the fragment is derived to present a non-linear epitope or epitopes (also referred to in the art as conformational epitopes). Assays for assessing whether the immunogenic fragment folds into a conformation comparable to the full-length polypeptide include, for example, the ability of the protein to react with mono- or polyclonal antibodies that are specific for native or unfolded epitopes, the retention of other ligand-binding functions, and the sensitivity or resistance of the polypeptide fragment to digestion with proteases (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY (2001)). Accordingly, by way of example, the three-dimensional conformation of a polypeptide fragment is sufficiently similar to the full-length polypeptide when the capability to bind and the level of binding of an antibody that specifically binds to the full-length polypeptide is substantially the same for the fragment as for the full-length polypeptide (i.e., the level of binding has been retained to a statistically, clinically, and/or biologically sufficient degree compared with the immunogenicity of the exemplary or wild-type full-length antigen).",

                                "As one embodiment, high-level expression of proteins from CHO cells has been developed at ExcellGene and has been improved from earlier technologies developed by leading pharmaceutical companies in the 1980s and 1990 (Wurm, F. M. (2004): Production of recombinant protein therapeutics in cultivated mammalian cells. Nature Biotechnology 22, 11, 1393-1398). Such technologies are used for the production of pharmaceutical protein products such as HERCEPTIN\u00ae, an antibody against breast cancer, HUMIRA\u00ae an antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or PULMOZYME\u00ae, an enzyme for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and are typically executed at 1000-20\u2032000 liter scale in stainless steel controlled bioreactors (M. De Jesus and F. M. Wurm (2011). Manufacturing Recombinant Proteins in kg-ton Quantities using Animal Cells in Bioreactors. Eur J Pharm Biopharm vol 78, 2, 184-188). These ExcellGene improved technologies include the use of ExcellGene's host cells that have been optimized for rapid growth (<16 h/doubling), selected under continuous culture without lag phases over many months. In addition to using the Transposase transfection approach described in the Examples (which favors integration of transgenic DNA into active chromatin), the cell culture approach for production is based on principles which are used for industrial scale up. The chosen cell host (CHOExpress\u2122 cells, ExcellGene SA) and derived recombinant cell populations have characteristics of growing in single cell suspension to densities of 5-20\u00d7106 cells/ml in animal component free media under batch culture condition, have a high subcultivation rate capacity (1/20 or higher) and grow under fed-batch conditions over 14-20 days to 25-35\u00d7106 cells/ml while maintaining high viability. The batch and fed-batch principles can be used at small scale from the milliliter scale to the liter scale of operation without the use of instrumented (CO2, oxygen, pH-controlled, etc.) bioreactors, i.e. in orbitally shaken tubes and in cylindrical containers. With respect to the Examples disclosed herein, 100-500 ml productions were sufficient to produce the quantities of protein necessary, after transient or stable expression and purification, to characterize their responsiveness of these to the various sera from patients and to determine their structural features.",
                                "To the extent protein modifications related to purification are undesirable for a future vaccine (e.g., His tags), an alternative purification approach is contemplated. Likewise, where a clinical candidate is identified, the final antigen candidate can be produced in clonally derived cell lines that match expectations for clinical manufacture. Thus, recombinant CHO pools are generated to compare, for example the histidine tag-free (\u201cHis tag-free\u201d) trimer containing DNA constructs, for expression and subsequent generation of high expressing clonally derived cell populations for cell culture upstream process development and for down-stream processing. An optimized manufacturing process is thus developed from such a clonally derived cell population, ready for Master Cell Bank generation and eventual production under cGMP.",

The seed train cultures are sub-cultivated every 3 to 4 days, with a seed density of 0.3-0.5\u00d7106 cells/mL and maintained until a manufacturing process in a larger bioreactor can be initiated. The cell culture media in such a process will be animal component-free or chemically defined. When a production process is envisioned, a culture from the seed train will be expanded through further sub-cultivation and scaling up the volume of culture until sufficient biomass has been generated to inoculate the final production vessel. The final production vessel can have a working volume between 10 liters and 1000 liters or even more, depending on the obtained volumetric yield from the clonally-derived cell line expressing the desired protein and the needs for the clinical trials and eventually for a market supply.",
                                "The inoculation density for the production process will, in one embodiment, be between 0.5 and 4\u00d7106 cells/mL and the production medium used will be animal component free or chemically defined. The inoculation into the production vessel may occur by simple transfer of the necessary volume of cell suspension and subsequent dilution of the culture with the fresh production medium. Otherwise it is also possible to transfer cells after a centrifugation step or a step that removes the inoculum medium prior to transfer of cells into the production vessel. In this case, the centrifuged cells are taken up into fresh medium and only then transferred.",
                                "The production culture will be monitored daily for growth and several metabolic parameters. The provisioning of certain feeds which include glucose will be done according to a prior developed optimal schedule which maximized product formation and product quality. The harvest of the supernatant containing the product of interest will be done when both product titer and product quality criteria are fulfilled.",
                                "Subsequently, the harvest fluid will be separated from cells and the clarified and sterile filtered product containing liquid will be exposed to several purification steps, typically at least 3 purification phases, which will include the use of chromatographic columns. These phases will eventually deliver a highly purified and stable protein product in a buffer (purified bulk) that can be used for further processing, for example for fill and finish, which will include the addition of a suitable vaccine adjuvant. The applied chromatography principles can include affinity chromatography, ionic exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and others. The methods used have to assure a maximal removal of cell host derived contaminants and will also provide support for the assumption that unknown adventitious agents, theoretically present or accidentally introduced into the product containing fluid streams, will be removed or inactivated to a degree that satisfy today's known regulatory constraints, as they are defined by the FDA or the European EMA."

Innate immunity is an immediate defense but it is not long-lasting or protective against future challenges. Immune system cells that generally have a role in innate immunity are phagocytic, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The innate immune system interacts with the adaptive (also called acquired) immune system in a variety of ways. Cells of the innate immune system can participate in antigen presentation to cells of the adaptive immune system, including expressing lymphokines that activate other cells, emitting chemotactic molecules that attract cells that may be specific to the invader, and secreting cytokines that recruit and activate cells of the adaptive immune system. The immunogenic/antigenic/vaccine compositions disclosed herein optionally include an agent that activates innate immunity in order to enhance the effectiveness of the composition.",
                                "Many types of agents can activate innate immunity. Organisms, like bacteria and viruses, can activate innate immunity, as can components of organisms, chemicals such as 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligo A, bacterial endotoxins, RNA duplexes, single stranded RNA and other molecules. Many of the agents act through a family of molecules\u2014the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Engaging a TLR can also lead to production of cytokines and chemokines and activation and maturation of dendritic cells, components involved in development of acquired immunity. The TLR family can respond to a variety of agents, including lipoprotein, peptidoglycan, flagellin, imidazoquinolines, CpG DNA, lipopolysaccharide and double stranded RNA (Akira et al. Biochemical Soc Transactions 31: 637-642, 2003). These types of agents are sometimes called pathogen (or microbe)-associated molecular patterns.",
                                "In one aspect, one or more adjuvants are included in the composition, in order to provide an agent(s) that activates innate immunity. An adjuvant is a substance incorporated into or administered simultaneously with antigen that increases the immune response. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how different adjuvants work (e.g., antigen depots, activators of dendritic cells, macrophages). Without wishing to be bound by theory, one mechanism involves activating the innate immune system, resulting in the production of chemokines and cytokines, which in turn activate the adaptive (acquired) immune response. In particular, some adjuvants activate dendritic cells through TLRs. Thus, an adjuvant is one type of agent that activates the innate immune system that may be used in a vaccine to EBOV. An adjuvant may act to enhance an acquired immune response in other ways too. Preferably the adjuvant is a TLR4 agonist.",

For example, the adjuvant combination may be selected to enhance the antibody response of the antigen, and/or to enhance the subject's innate immune system response. Activating the innate immune system results in the production of chemokines and cytokines, which in turn may activate an adaptive (acquired) immune response. An important consequence of activating the adaptive immune response is the formation of memory immune cells so that when the host re-encounters the antigen, the immune response occurs quicker and generally with better quality.",
                                "The adjuvant(s) may be pre-formulated prior to their combination with the EBOV proteins described herein. In one embodiment, an adjuvant may be provided as a stable aqueous suspension of less than 0.2 um and may further comprise at least one component selected from the group consisting of phospholipids, fatty acids, surfactants, detergents, saponins, fluorodated lipids, and the like. The adjuvant(s) may be formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion in which the adjuvant is incorporated in the oil phase. For use in humans, the oil is preferably metabolizable. The oil may be any vegetable oil, fish oil, animal oil or synthetic oil; the oil should not be toxic to the recipient and is capable of being transformed by metabolism. Nuts (such as peanut oil), seeds, and grains are common sources of vegetable oils. Particularly suitable metabolizable oils include squalene (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexane), an unsaturated oil found in many different oils, and in high quantities in shark-liver oil. Squalene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. In addition, the oil-in-water emulsions typically comprise an antioxidant, such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,650,155, 6,623,739). Stabilizers, such as a triglyceride, ingredients that confer isotonicity, and other ingredients may be added. An exemplary oil-in-water emulsion using squalene is known as \u201cSE\u201d and comprises squalene, glycerol, phosphatidylcholine or lecithin or other block co-polymer as a surfactant in an ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 5.1, with alpha-toceraphol.",
                                "The method of producing oil-in-water emulsions is well known to a person skilled in the art. Commonly, the method comprises mixing the oil phase with a surfactant, such as phosphatidylcholine, poloxamer, block co-polymer, or a TWEEN80\u00ae solution, followed by homogenization using a homogenizer. For instance, a method that comprises passing the mixture one, two, or more times through a syringe needle is suitable for homogenizing small volumes of liquid. Equally, the emulsification process in a microfluidizer (M110S microfluidics machine, maximum of 50 passes, for a period of 2 min at maximum pressure input of 6 bar (output pressure of about 850 bar)) can be adapted to produce smaller or larger volumes of emulsion. This adaptation can be achieved by routine experimentation comprising the measurement of the resultant emulsion until a preparation was achieved with oil droplets of the desired diameter. Other equipment or parameters to generate an emulsion may also be used. Disclosures of emulsion compositions, and method of their preparation, may be found in, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Preferably the immune response elicited includes: neutralizing antibody response; antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); antibody cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP); complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); T cell-mediated response such as CD4+, CD8+, or a protective antibody response. Protective in this context does not necessarily require that the subject is completely protected against infection. A protective response is achieved when the subject is protected from developing symptoms of disease, especially severe disease associated with the pathogen corresponding to the heterologous antigen.

In some embodiments, the amount of the protein is within any range having a lower limit of 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240 or 250 \u03bcg, and an independently selected upper limit of 2000, 1950, 1900, 1850, 1800, 1750, 1700, 1650, 1600, 1550, 1500, 1450, 1400, 1350, 1300 or 1250, 1200, 1150, 1100, 1050, 1000, 950, 900, 850, 800, 750, 700, 650, 600, 550, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300 or 250 \u03bcg, provided that the lower limit is less than the upper limit. Generally, a human dose will be in a volume of from 0.1 ml to 1 ml, preferably from 0.25 ml to 0.5 ml. The amount utilized in an antigenic composition is selected based on the subject population. An optimal amount for a particular composition can be ascertained by standard studies involving observation of antibody titers and other responses (e.g., antigen-induced cytokine secretion) in subjects. Following an initial vaccination, subjects can receive a boost in about 4-12 weeks."

However, it is known that the recombinant EBOV GP protein is extremely unstable and adopts a monomeric state in solution, which is structurally distinct from the native trimer. The present disclosure and following examples thus describe stabilized, near-native EBOV GP trimers showing superior antigenic profiles than those of the monomeric wild type protein. Through biochemical and immunological profiling of these candidates, the importance of suitable antigen conformation for induction of neutralizing antibodies has been supported. The recombinant Ebola GP trimers presented herein thus have the potential to be recognized as valuable antigen candidates for the development of an efficacious EBOV vaccine that is currently being tested in pre-clinical animal models for immunogenicity and induction of superior neutralizing antibody responses."

These two vectors are co-transfected to obtain stable recombinant CHO cell lines. The gene-of-interest vector, pXLG6, places the DNA of interest, together with a resistance marker gene (puromycin resistance), in an expression cassette framed by piggyBac terminal repeats (Fraser et al. 1983, J. Virology 47 (2) 287-300). DNA in transfections constituted pXLG6 based vectors (ExcellGene SA, see FIG. 1) into which several EBOLA GP1/2 variant encoding DNA constructs were inserted. In the pXLG 6 map\u2014ITR in the plasmid map indicate the positions of the piggyBac terminal repeat sequences. 2% of the transfected DNA contained the pXLG5 vector (FIG. 2), which encodes the piggyBac transposase.

Short term \u201ctransient\u201d expression of the piggyBac transposase in animal cells will result in excision of the terminal repeat framed DNA from the pXLG6 vector and subsequent integration of the excised DNA into the genome of the cells.

These constructs mimic the proteolysis step that occurs in vivo, thus enhancing the presentation of critical neutralization epitopes while removing epitopes located in the glycan cap and mucin-like domain that are mostly linear and non-protective [Davidson, Edgar, et al, J virol, 89(21) \u201cMechanism of binding to Ebola virus glycoprotein by the ZMapp, ZMAb, and MB-003 cocktail antibodies.\u201d J Virology (2015].): JVI-01490.

The aim was to confirm the structural integrity of the produced proteins and their ability to be recognized by conformational monoclonal antibodies. These evaluations were of fundamental importance in order to assess the native-like conformation of recombinant EBOV GPs and to dissect if epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies were available. The possibility to produce a protein-based vaccine based on a near-native candidate highly recognized by antibodies of disease survivors would confer us a great advantage in terms of induction of neutralizing antibodies through vaccination.",

In addition, the serum of an Ebola survivor (\u201cHUG\u201d) was used.",

Surprisingly, signal development was obtained with the antibody pair rabbit KZ52/human KZ52 for all the four tested constructs (FIG. 8). Since the epitope recognized by KZ52 is known to be located in the monomeric region of the EBOV GP trimer [Lee, Jeffrey E., et al. \u201cStructure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.\u201d Nature 454.7201 (2008): 177], this was identified as a proof of the ability of the monomeric recombinant GPs to rearrange in a dimeric, if not trimeric, configuration when in solution.",
                                "The reactivity of the trimers in this assay set-up resulted significantly higher than that of the two monomeric molecules. The performed experiments confirmed that the recombinant proteins were retaining the conformation of the epitope recognized by the conformational and neutralizing mAb KZ52, which is located at the base of the GP chalice. Moreover, the mucin-like domain resulted not to be critical for the retention of the native conformation of the EBOV GP protein, and its removal allowed unmasking of critical neutralizing epitopes located at the base of the chalice. Actually, the recognition of the mucin-deleted protein was higher than that of the native-like protein, both with KZ52 and the HUG serum (FIG. 8).",
                                "A panel of five conformational mouse mAbs produced by CEA and tested for the recognition of pseudo types Ebola virus in an in vitro neutralization assays was used for further immunological profiling of the antigens. Among these mAbs, listed in FIG. 9, EZP01S, EZP16S, and EZP35S were known for their good neutralizing activity. In all the cases, recognition of the mucin-deleted version of the protein was higher, confirming the initial hypothesis of the mucin-like domain acting as a barrier in preventing access of mAbs to their epitopes. Remarkably, the immunological profiling of the engineered variants showed an increased breadth of reactivity both with the panel of mAbs as well as with the human survivor's serum. These results further validate the design strategy and show that trimeric constructs can be obtained with superior antigenic profiles than those of the wild type protein.",
                                "The effect of the GP variants in inhibiting the neutralizing activity of mAbs in an infection assay was assessed on a murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral pseudo type platform. The principle of the test was to evaluate the ability of mAbs in neutralizing the infection of cells made by pseudo-viruses expressing the GP protein. Recognition of the recombinant GPs by neutralizing mAbs was tested (thus inhibiting their inhibition activity on the infection assay). To reach this goal, neutralizing antibodies EZP01S, EZP16S, and EZP35S were tested at two different concentrations (1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml), corresponding to an 80% and 0% of infected cells in the pseudo-type assay, against various concentrations of recombinant GPs. As evident from the left panels in FIG. 9, mAbs at the lowest concentrations are captured by the recombinant GPs thus causing a complete cells infection. The main differences are evident in the right panels with the highest mAb concentrations. In this case, mAbs EZP01S and EZP35S showed to be equally sensitive to GP monomers and trimers, suggesting the recognized epitope is similarly accessible in both protein configurations. On the other hand, mAbs EZP16S recognize an epitope that is highly accessible in the trimers, and probably covered by the mucin-like domain given the fact that in presence of the GP \u0394TM-X-HIS monomer cell infection is completely inhibited (FIG. 9). Globally, these results support our hypothesis that for induction of broad neutralizing antibodies a trimeric GP antigen is to be preferred.",

(2016). \u201cSafety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study.\u201d The Lancet infectious diseases 16(3): 311-320.] were analyzed by a direct ELISA against GP \u0394TM-X-HIS and GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-X-HIS in their native configuration or after a denaturation and reduction treatment. This treatment consisted in an overnight incubation step at 37\u00b0 C. in presence of guanidinium chloride 6 M and DTT 0.05 M (disulphide bonds reduction), followed by a 1 h incubation at room temperature with N-Ethylmaleimide to block the free cysteine residues. The characterization of the antibody response elicited by the ChAd3-EboZ vaccine showed that 2/3 of the volunteers raised antibodies directed against linear epitopes of the GP protein, which are thought to be less protective than conformational epitopes. This result highlighted the importance of having an antigen with native-like structure, expected to induce or enhance conformational antibodies with a higher chance to be protective. A panel of 10 sera were selected as representative of various types of responses: sera directed preferentially against the native or denatured protein, and sera recognizing preferentially the linear epitopes of the mucin-like domain.",
                                "The panel of 10 sera derived from ChAd3-EBOZ vaccinated volunteers was analyzed in the pseudo-virus neutralization assay of Dr. Laurent Bellanger (FIG. 10). The panel was representative of the various types of responses identified: sera directed preferentially against the native or denatured protein, and sera recognizing preferentially the linear epitopes of the mucin-like domain. As a result, the highest affinities for the GP protein expressed on the pseudo-virus surface were found in sera recognizing mainly the native GPs, thus confirming the importance of having a native-like vaccine candidate.",
                                "The panel of 10 volunteers' sera was tested in direct ELISA against the recombinant EBOV GPs and the antibody responses were compared with responses of the panel of Ebola survivors (FIG. 11). GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-T4-X-HIS was the most recognized protein by both volunteers and survivors.",
                                "The two panels of 10 volunteers and 10 survivors were compared in a competition ELISA against various concentrations of the monomer GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-X-HIS or the T4 and GCN4 trimers (FIG. 12). Since the panel of survivors showed a higher affinity for T4 trimers, this protein was finally selected as antigen candidate for the Ebola GP-based vaccine.",
                                "Survivors showed to have a majority of IgG1 antibodies directed against trimers (FIG. 13). The IgG1 subclass is less evident in the volunteers' panel, though being perceived as important for non-recurrence of the virus in long-term survivors [Radinsky, O., et al. (2017). \u201cSudan ebolavirus long recovered survivors produce GP-specific Abs that are of the IgG1 subclass and preferentially bind Fc\u03b3RI.\u201d Scientific reports 7.1: 6054.]. Moreover, volunteers show an increased amount of IgM antibodies mainly directed against the mucin-like domain (FIG. 14). This might be typical of vector-based vaccines, since the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine have been shown to induce low affinity and low-durability IgM [Khurana, S., et al. (2016) \u201cHuman antibody repertoire after VSV-Ebola vaccination identifies novel targets and virus-neutralizing IgM antibodies.\u201d Nature medicine 22.12: 1439.].",

T-cells were stimulated with a pool of 15-mers overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the GP protein (left graph) or the same pool without the region corresponding to the mucin-like domain. Analysis was performed before vaccination (D0) or 28 days after vaccination (D28) in the placebo group, as well as in the groups of people immunized with the ChAd3-EBOZ vaccine at low dose or high dose."

Purification was done after clarification and cell removal by buffer exchange and chromatography using a GE Healthcare HiScreen\u2122 NiFF column for His-tagged proteins, following the manufacturer's recommendation for use. For clonally derived cell lines and eventual use in GMP manufacture for clinical use, the construct for the expression of GP \u0394TM-\u0394MUC-T4 was used.
