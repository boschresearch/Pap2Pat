    "date": "2009-09-14 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "An immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) method for separating and/or purifying compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group such as nucleic acid, presumably through interaction with the abundant aromatic nitrogen atoms in the purine or pyrimidine moiety. The method can also be used to purify compounds containing purine or pyrimidine moieties where the purine and pyrimidine moieties are shielded from interaction with the column matrix from compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group. Thus, double-stranded plasmid and genomic DNA, which has no low binding affinity can be easily separated from RNA and/or oligonucleotides which bind strongly to metal-charged chelating matrices. IMAC columns clarify plasmid DNA from bacterial alkaline lysates, purify a ribozyme, and remove primers and other contaminants from PCR reactions. The metal ion affinity of yeast RNA decreases in the order: copper (II), nickel (II), zinc (II), and cobalt (II).",

                        "The present invention relates to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) instrument, a substrate containing immobilized metal affinity ligands, and a method for purifying and/or separating compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group using the instrument or substrate.",
                        "More particularly, the present invention relates to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) instrument and/or a substrate containing immobilized metal affinity ligands where the metal ion immobilized on the ligand of the column of an IMAC instrument or the substrate is capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group where binding affinities results in a separation of different compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group or in a purification of compounds that do not contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group from compounds that do contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group. The present invention also relates to a method for purifying and/or separating compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group such as single stranded DNA, RNA, or other compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group, or to a method for removing compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group from compounds that do not contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group such as removing nucleotides and primers from PCR reactions and/or reaction products and purifying plasmid DNA.",
                        "2. Description of the Related Art",
                        "Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) was introduced by Porath et al. (1, 2) as a means of purifying proteins based on the affinity of their surface-exposed amino acids (especially histidines) for chelated metal ions. The method has found widespread application in the purification of recombinant histidine-tagged and pharmaceutical proteins, most commonly using Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions chelated by iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) functionalities. Metal chelate ligands are best known as affinity agents in chromatography but have also been immobilized on foams (3), membranes (4), biosensor chips (5), and in electrophoresis gels (6); they have also been used as affinity precipitation agents (7).",
                        "The interaction of metal ions with nucleic acids is a long-standing and active field of study (8, 9). While metal ion binding to nucleic acids is well known, and plays an important role in the function of the widely used cancer drug cisplatin (10), IMAC has found very limited application in the purification of nucleic acids. Fanou-Ayi and Vijayalakshmi (11) and Hubert and Porath (12) demonstrated the binding of mononucleotides to copper IMAC resins, and histidine-conjugated PCR primers have been used to facilitate purification of the resulting histidine-tagged oligonucleotide products (13), but the potential applications of IMAC in nucleic acid separation and analysis remain largely unexplored.",
                        "Thus, there is a need in the art for an IMAC instrument and method, where the IMAC column includes metals or metal ions capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group to effectuate separation and/or purification of different compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group or for purifying compounds that do not contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group from compounds that do contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The inventors have found that a compound containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group such as a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule, e.g., an oligonucleotide or an RNA molecule or a molecule including A, G, C, T or U, have affinity to an IMAC matrix; while a compound that does not contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group or easily accessible aromatic nitrogen on a purine or pyrimidine moiety or group, such as double-stranded DNA, RNA, RNA/DNA complexes, has little or no affinity to the same IMAC matrix. Thus, the inventors have demonstrated that the affinity of immobilized metals toward nucleic acid bases allows the use of IMAC in the separation of double strained nucleic acid polymers from single stranded nucleic acid polymers, the purification of plasmid DNA, RNA, and/or the removal of nucleotides and primers from PCR reactions.",
                        "Although the present invention is primarily directed to nucleic acids (DNA and/or RNA), the present invention enjoys much broader application in the fields of biomolecule separation, purification, identification, quantitation, etc., where the target molecule includes a non-shielded purine and/or pyrimidine moieties or residue. Such biomolecules include, without limitation, AMP, ATP, GTP, CTP, NAD, Coenzyme A, Hypoxanthine, Xanthine, Orotic acid, Inosine, or any other biomolecule having a purine and/or pyrimidine moiety sufficiently exposed to permit binding to an IMAC reagent of this invention.",
                        "The inventors found that purine-containing, single-stranded nucleic acid molecules, such as oligonucleotides or unstructured RNA molecules, can be selectively bound by IMAC matrices. The inventors assume that the binding may be similar to the binding of histidine, which is known to bind to IMAC matrices. The inventors found that soft metals avoid nonspecific interactions with backbone phosphates. (14-16) The inventors have found that the high, specific affinity of chelated soft metals for nucleic acid bases allows the use of IMAC in the purification of plasmid DNA and RNA, in the removal of contaminants and primers from PCR reaction products, and in the detection of mismatches in DNA heteroduplexes.",
                        "The present invention broadly relates to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column including an IMAC matrix including immobilized metal atoms and/or ions capable of binding compounds containing non-shielded purine and/or pyrimidine moieties or groups. The present invention also broadly relates to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) instruments including an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column or absorbent including a matrix having immobilized metal atoms or ions capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group.",
                        "The present invention also broadly relates to a method for separating different compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group by passing a solution containing the different compounds through an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column including a matrix having immobilized metal atoms or ions capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group and analyzing the effluent from the column as a function of time or over a given period of time.",
                        "The present invention also broadly relates to a method for purifying a solution containing a major compound containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group and a minor compound containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group by passing the solution through an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column including a matrix having immobilized metal atoms or ions capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group and analyzing the effluent from the column as a function of time or over a given period of time. The column can include metal atoms or ions that have a higher or lower binding affinity for the major verses the minor compound and separation will results, provided that the binding affinities are indeed different.",
                        "The present invention also broadly relates to a method for purifying a solution containing a compound that does not contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group and a compound that does contain a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group by passing the solution through an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column or absorbent including a matrix having immobilized metal atoms or ions capable of binding compounds containing a non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety or group and analyzing the effluent from the column as a function of time or over a given period of time.",
                        "The present invention also provides a method for removing fluorophore tagged nucleotides or nucleosides from a solution involving passing the solution through an IMAC column capable of either binding to nitrogen atoms of a base residue in the nucleotides or nucleoside, binding to atoms and/or functional groups of the fluorophores or both and removing all non-bound materials from the column. Thus, fluorophore labeled nucleotides or oligonucleotides can be removed from the solution.",

The column is then spun for about 1 minute at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. For samples from DNA and/or RNA sequencer or PCR reactions or other sequencing protocols, the sample or reaction product is loaded directly onto a metal charged spin column, preferably a nickel charged spin column and centrifuge. The primers and bases bind to the spin column and the purified sequencing product passes through the column and can be recovered from the supernatant in the microfuge tube. For plasmid purification, the sample is loaded directly on to a metal charged spin column, preferably a copper charged spin column and centrifuge. In the case of plasmid DNA, the RNA and other contaminants bind to the spin column and the clarified plasmid can be recovered from the supernatant in the microfuge tube.

                                "To test binding capacities and trends, equilibrium adsorption isotherms were run to find affinities of RNA and DNA to IMAC matrices. The first experiment ran was to distinguish the different binding affinities of RNA and double-stranded DNA. In the example, equilibrium isotherms were performed using Zn (II) charged IDA IMAC resin using total bakers yeast RNA and pBGS19Luxwt plasmid DNA. The resulting isotherms showed no apparent binding of the plasmid DNA, but a defined binding isotherm for bakers yeast RNA. This experiment represented was the first evidence of differential binding affinity to an IMAC reagent for single-stranded RNA and double-stranded DNA.",
                                "Next, binding isotherms were run using different divalent metal ions (Cu.sup.2+, Ni.sup.2+, Zn.sup.2+ and Co.sup.2+) and total bakers yeast RNA to determine the relative binding efficiencies. FIG. 1 shows the isotherms for each divalent metal ion. From the isotherms is it apparent that each metal has a unique isotherm plateau, i.e., the plateau for each metal ion occurs at a distinct value of bound material. This plateau value corresponds to the loading capacity of the matrix. The RNA binding efficiencies for each metal For copper, nickel, zinc, and cobalt charged IMAC matrix are 5, 3.5, 1 and 0 mgs, respectively. RNA capacity of Cu (II) charged IDA-Sepharose was confirmed by breakthrough curve analysis (not shown). The trends in these isotherms do not follow the metal ion's positions on the periodic chart, but do follow the known trends seen for protein binding behavior to IMAC matrices. Cu (II) is known to bind a single exposed histidine residue; Zn (II) and Ni (II) bind at a minimum of 2 adjacent exposed histidine residues; and, Co (II) is even more selective for a 6 his tag.",
                                "The different metals have different affinities for nucleic acids. Each metal has a different trade-off between loading capacity and selectivity. Cu (II) has a higher affinity for nucleic acids, while Ni (II) has a higher selectivity for nucleic acid components. For applications where a very high binding affinity is desired (plasmid separation, etc.), Cu (II) is the metal of choice. However, if gradients are run to get a specific product from a mixture (RNA separations, PCR product cleanup), selectivity is more important and Ni (II) and/or Zn (II) should be considered.",

                                "To further explore the mechanism by which IMAC matrices bind nucleic acids, oligonucleotides were obtained, which were 20-mer homopolymers of A, G, T, and C on a deoxyribonucleic acid backbone. Isotherms were performed using Ni (II) charged IMAC resin and the resulting curves are shown in FIG. 3. Poly (A) bound with the highest affinity, while poly (G) had an approximately 10 times binding efficiency or selectivity. Poly (C) had a slightly higher affinity for IMAC matrix than that of poly (T). In addition, duplexes of the A and T homopolymers and duplexes of th G and C homopolymers had no binding affinity to the IMAC matrix charged with Ni (II).",
                                "Langmuir fits were performed on these homopolymer isotherms and q.sub.max/K.sub.d was plotted. The q.sub.max/K.sub.d of poly (A) is approximately 10 times higher than that of poly (G) and the q.sub.max/K.sub.d of poly (C) is roughly 5 times higher than that of poly (T). Generally, these trends are thought to result form the structure of the nucleic acid bases. Adenine lacks a hydrogen atom at the nitrogen atom at position 1 and has a \u00bd character aromaticity through resonance. Guanine has an amine at position 2 compared to a hydrogen atom in the case of adenine, potentially adding an additional steric hindrance to the binding of metal ions to the position 2 nitrogen. A similar structural difference is seen in the purines where thymine has a hydrogen atom at position 3 that could lower the affinity of thymine compared to cytosine.",
                                "These isotherms lead to some guideline when using IMAC matrices to bind nucleic acids. First, the IMAC charged matrix does not appear to bind the phosphate backbone or the sugar moieties of the nucleic acid oligomers or polymers. The low affinity of Ni (II) charged IMAC resin toward poly (T) homo-polymer is clear evidence that the binding is not purely a backbone effect, since poly (A) and poly (G) showed relatively large binding affinities for the IMAC matrix. Moreover, because duplexed nucleic acid oligomers or polymers did not bind to the IMAC matrix, the binding does not occur at either the phosphate backbone structure or the sugar moieties. Furthermore, because single-stranded oligonucleotides bind to the IMAC matrix, but the duplexes of the A/T and G/C homopolymers do not, the interaction appears to be based on affinity of the IMAC matrix toward the actual exposed bases on the single-stranded nucleic acids (or single stranded regions of larger nucleic acid molecules).",
                                "Second, the separation appears to be dependent on the number of single stranded purines available for interaction with the IMAC matrix. With the purines having such a large binding capacity, the method can be used to differentiate nucleic acid sequence with different purine to pyrimidine contents, especially at the extremes of purine and pyrimidine content. Thus, the higher the single-stranded purine content, the higher the affinity for the IMAC matrix.",

A20 bound with the highest affinity while G20 had an affinity approximately 10 times lower (based on a Langmuir fit). The affinities of the pyrimidines were much lower than those of the purines (approximately 60-and 300-fold lower affinity than A20 for C20 and T20 respectively). In addition, the A20/T20 heteroduplex had no detectable binding affinity, eliminating the phosphate backbone as a major source of adsorption affinity. The relative affinities of the homopolymers confirmed the nucleotide monomer results of Fanou-Ayi and Vijayalakshmi (11) and Hubert and Porath (12).",

The major contaminant left in the plasmid DNA purified by compaction precipitation is contaminating RNA and linear DNA (1-5%). The IMAC separation technique of this invention is well-suited to bind the remaining RNA (the minor component) and DNA fragments to further purify large quantities of plasmid DNA on relatively small IMAC columns",

The bound RNA was eluted in the figure by ammonium chloride, but elution can also be accomplished by using EDTA, pH, imidazole, or histidine.

The PCR reactions were loaded directly onto the spin columns allowing for the rapid removal of PCR primers and stunted fragments. FIG. 10 shows a 2% agarose gel of the cleanup of a PCR product using a Ni (II) charged IMAC spin column. The spin column mainly left behind the double-stranded PCR product and the plasmid DNA template as seen in lane 4 of FIG. 10. In addition, other metal ions were evaluated for this application. Cu (II) binds, not only the primers and fragments, but also the PCR product itself. Because of its high affinity for aromatic nitrogens, copper is thought to bind to the ragged ends commonly left by Taq polymerase. Thus, the present invention is also related to the direct binding and elution of the PCR fragments.",

The IMAC column captured the primers and the defective products leaving primarily the double-stranded PCR product and the plasmid DNA template (FIG. 11 top and bottom, Lane 3). Partial elution (FIG. 11 top, Lane 5) shows that the column binds not only the primers and fragments, but also the Taq PCR product itself, presumably through mismatched bulges or the 3\u2032A overhang commonly left by Taq polymerase. However, processing of a Pfu (21) polymerase PCR reaction product mixture amplifying the same sequence gave similar results (FIG. 11 bottom, Lane 5), but products of this proofreading polymerase were not as readily retained on the IMAC column. When the PCR product band in the elutant lanes of the gels were integrated, 1.6 times as much PCR product was retained on the IMAC column when Taq polymerase PCR reactions were purified vs. Pfu PCR reactions. In addition, when the IMAC purified Taq PCR product was sequenced improved fidelity was seen over a non-IMAC purified control sample (results not shown).",

As shown in FIG. 12, retention correlates well with the binding affinities of the homopolymers (FIG. 4). Especially with the enhanced resolution of metal affinity capillary electrophoresis (22), this mismatch separation could serve as the basis of PCR product cleanup, SNP scoring, or hybridization assays. Fragmentation of a potentially mutated gene followed by heat denaturation and reannealing in the presence of the corresponding wild type DNA, could allow efficient DNA sequence confirmation by IMAC in an analysis similar to \u201ctryptic mapping\u201d of proteins."

                        "IMAC, a robust and widely used chromatographic process, and now represents an effective nucleic acid separation technique with many applications. Metal charged IMAC ligands have affinity for single-stranded nucleic acids, in particular exposed nucleic acid bases or other molecules including at least one non-shielded purine or pyrimidine moiety. Through isotherm measurement, the IMAC matrix has been proven to bind to the nucleic acid bases and not the phosphate anion backbone or the ribose in the backbone. The aromatic nitrogens in the nucleic acid bases are the targets of the metal ion interaction meaning that purines have a higher affinity than pyrimidines for the charged IMAC matrix. The determined order of affinities are A>G>>C.gtoreq.T.",
                        "The nitrogen containing aromatic bases can be effectively stripped from a bacterial lysate or free solution. One preferred application of IMAC described herein is the purification of plasmid DNA by retaining RNA contaminants. In addition, separation of RNA (b ribozyme), single-stranded nucleic acids, and primers, truncated fragments and bases can be easily be removed from sequencing/PCR reactions.",
                        "Chelated soft metal ions interact with exposed bases of nucleic acids, and this interaction can serve as the basis of a variety of preparative and analytical methods useful in genetic technology. In addition, to those demonstrated here, further applications may include eukaryotic (poly(A) tailed) mRNA isolation, improvement of the quality and clonability of PCR products, and economical SNP scoring and sequence confirmation.",
                        "Detailed Description of Apparatuses of this Invention",
                        "Referring now to FIGS. 13A&B, two preferred embodiments of separation apparatus of this invention, generally 100, are shown to include a column 102 having an inlet 104 adapted to receive a sample (not shown), an outlet 106 and a single zone 108, while the column 102 of FIG. 13B includes a first zone 108 and a second zone 110. The single or first zone 108 includes an IMAC matrix with one or more immobilized metal atoms and/or ions bound thereto, while the second zone includes another matrix capable of separating sample components based on a different chemical and/or physical property such as size, charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, or any other property. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art should recognize that the two zones in FIG. 13B can be two different columns connected together in series.",
                        "The apparatus 100 is utilized by supplying a sample or sample flow 112 to the inlet 104 and analyzing an apparatus effluent 114 leaving the outlet 106. The sample or sample flow 112 can be a single sample or the output of an upstream separation apparatus. Moreover, the apparatus 100 can be used in a discrete or continuous mode of operation depending on the nature of the analysis intended.",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 14, a preferred embodiment of an analytical instrument apparatus of this invention, generally 200, is shown to include a sample input unit 202 in fluid communication via a first fluid conduit 204 with a separation unit 206. The separation unit 204 includes at least one separation apparatus of FIGS. 13A&B. The separation unit 204 is in fluid communication via a second fluid conduit 208 with a detector unit 210. The detector unit 210 is adapted to convert one or more properties of an effluent of the separation unit 206 to a signal. The signal is forwarded to an analyzer unit 212 via an electric conduit 214, which places the detector unit 210 in electrical communication with the analyzer unit 212. The analyzer unit 212 converts the signal produced by the detector unit 210 into a measurement of the detected property. Of course, the detector unit 210 and the analyzer unit 212 can be a single unit. Generally, the analyzer unit 212 is a digital processing unit including a memory, a digital processor, output devices such as a printer, a CRT, or the like and associated software and hardware for communication, storage, retrieval and human interaction. The sample input unit 202 can be an injector unit for injecting or introducing a single sample or plug of sample into the separation unit 206",
                        "The term fluid communication means that fluid is able to flow from one unit to the other unit in the indicated direction. The term electrical communication means that an electric signal travels from one unit to another unit in the indicated direction.",
