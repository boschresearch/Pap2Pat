                        "Genetically modified (GM) plants, including GM trees, turf grasses, biofuel and forage crops, and ornamentals, improve commercially important traits, such as biomass and biofuel production, digestibility, bioremediation, ornamental value, and tolerance to stresses. However, commercial uses of GM plants are severely limited by stringent government regulations due to concerns over potential ecological effects of transgene flow and floral-modified plantations. Transgene flow from GM plants to non-GM plants and wild populations is mainly mediated by dispersal of pollen and seeds. Early studies found that the pollen-mediated gene flow from GM Roundup Ready creeping bentgrass (a turfgrass) occurred within 2 to 21 km. The non-GM rabbit food grass could pollinate the GM creeping bentgrass to produce transgenic intergeneric hybrid offspring, suggesting that the transgene escape can also be mediated by the female part of GM plants. Long distance pollen-mediated gene flow occurred between weed beets as far as 9.6 km and the resulting interfield gene flow is unavoidable. Pollen migration from poplars often goes beyond 10 km, indicating that similar issues happened in GM trees. Moreover, gene flow from GM crops to native populations was detected in maize, soybean, wheat, and canola. To overcome regulatory hurdles to field research and, ultimately, commercial uses of GM plants, a practical solution is to create sterile plants by ablating floral organs/tissues using toxic genes under control of specific promoters or by altering flowering time and floral organs via manipulating genes critical for flower development.",
                        "Strategies on making male sterility have been employed to prevent the pollen-mediated transgene flow. This strategy has also been applied to asexually propagated GM perennial grasses and trees. In addition, manipulating genes regulating flowering time, floral meristem identify, floral organ identity, and floral organ establishment is used to abolish plant fertility. Although male sterility has been successfully achieved via different approaches in various plant species, it cannot completely prevent transgene flow. Seed development in male sterile GM plants can be rescued by the long-distance transfer of pollen from non-GM plants. The same is also true for female sterile GM plants which disperse pollen to non-GM or male sterile GM plants. Thus, completely abolishing male and female fertility is the only fail-safe way to prevent transgene flow. Moreover, existing strategies for creating male sterility, female sterility, or both lead to loss or alterations of entire flowers or floral organs, which may cause potential ecological effects on biodiversity of species associated with flowers, such as insects. In addition, genetically engineered ornamental plants that do not produce flowers or exhibit floral organ alterations reduce their ornamental value. The remaining toxicity of BARNASE in non-target organs due to unspecific basal activities of employed promoters inhibits plant survival and growth. In addition, the male fertility restoring system BARNASE-BARSTAR has been used to restore the male fertility via suppressing the BARNASE enzyme activity by its protein inhibitor BARSTAR. Seed production of BARNASE-created male sterile plants is restored by introducing BARSTAR, a BARNASE inhibitor. However, the BARNASE:BARSTAR protein complex may cause potential health risk and no restoration system has been tested to restore female fertility.",
                        "Biotechnologies for engineering sterility without altering either growth or floral structure are needed to prevent dispersal of transgenes and to reduce concerns regarding ecological impacts from genetically modified (GM) plants, such as GM trees, turf grasses, biofuel and forage crops, and ornamentals. There is a need to generate sterility in both male and female reproductive organs without affecting plant growth or altering flower structure. In addition, a system to restore both male and female fertility is needed to directly down-regulate the expression of BARNASE."

Variant may also mean a protein with an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to a referenced protein with an amino acid sequence that retains at least one biological activity. A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity, degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes may be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art. Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132 (1982). The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophobicity and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes may be substituted and still retain protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic indexes of \u00b12 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids may also be used to reveal substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of the hydrophilicity of amino acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide. Substitutions may be performed with amino acids having hydrophilicity values within \u00b12 of each other. Both the hydrophobicity index and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties.",

The compositions for restoring fertility involves an artificial microRNA system that inhibits BARNASE expression to restore plant fertility. To restore fertility to both male and female sterile plants, the artificial microRNA system, such as the ER::amiR-BARNASE system, induces the expression of an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) to post-transcriptionally suppress the expression of BARNASE. Instead of inhibiting the BARNASE activity by BARSTAR at the protein level, the amiR-BARNASE system, under the control of an inducible promoter, such as the estradiol inducible promoter, suppresses the expression of BARNASE at the post-transcriptional level, which consequently decreases the accumulation of BARNASE protein. Not only does the inducible treatment, such as estradiol treatment, restore fertility of male sterile and female sterile plants, such as SDS::SDS-BARNASE ER::amiR-BARNASE double transgenic plants, but also the offspring of these plants are completely sterile. The amiR-BARNASE system, such as the ER::amiR-BARNASE system, can be used as an alternative approach to conveniently and efficiently restore fertility of BARNASE-induced sterile plants.",

Besides traditional uses of grasses, many grass species can provide a large and sustainable cellulosic biomass feedstock. Recently, switchgrass was selected as a biomass feedstock for renewable bioenergy by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Feedstock Development Program since its broad adaption, high yield, and minimal agricultural inputs. Genetically modified (GM) switchgrass has been made to improve biomass and biofuel production, but the approval for commercial uses of GM plants is subject to complicated and stringent government regulations due to economic, politic or social concerns over potential ecological effects of transgene flow. Completely abolishing both male and female (bisexual) fertility is the only fail-safe way to prevent transgene flow; however, approaches to generating both bisexual sterility are limited. The gene structure of SDS in monocots is more conserved than that in dicots. In grass plants, two conserved regulatory motifs in the promoter region and the other two in introns may be possibly important for the SDS specific expression (see FIGS. 17 and 18A-18D).",

To create completely both male and female sterile plants without altering flower structure, the SDS::BARNASE construct was generated using the 1.5-kb promoter of the SDS gene and a modified BARNASE (Zhang et al., 2012) to genetically ablate microspore and megaspore mother cells in Arabidopsis (FIG. 1A). Among 66 examined SDS::BARNASE transgenic plants, none of them showed the specific phenotype in sterility. Instead, compared with the wild-type (FIG. 2A), SDS::BARNASE young plants were defective in vegetative growth, indicated by abnormal shape and numbers of rosette leaves (FIGS. 2B and 2C). Different from the WT adult plant (FIG. 2D), SDS::BARNASE adult plants also exhibited various abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarf and fertile (FIG. 2E), dwarf and sterile (FIG. 2F), and even no inflorescence (FIG. 2G). The height of mature SDS::BARNASE plants was significantly reduced (FIG. 2H). Moreover, SDS::BARNASE plants produced significantly fewer rosette leaves than that of wild-type (FIG. 2I). Various defects of SDS::BARNASE plants in growth and development suggest that the 1.5-kb promoter of the SDS gene failed to drive the specific expression of BARNASE in microspore and megaspore mother cells.",

Among 25 examined SDS::GUS transgenic plants, GUS signals were detected in cotyledons, true leaves, and shoot apical meristem of young seedlings (FIG. 3A), as well as in carpels and stigmas of young buds (FIGS. 3B-3D).

In examined 18 SDS::SDS-GFP transgenic plants, the GFP signal was not detected during the seedling stage and later in the vegetative growth stage. We, however, observed GFP signals only in microspore mother cells in anthers (FIG. 3E) and megaspore mother cell in ovule during the reproductive stage (FIG. 3F).

                                "To generate complete both male and female sterility by specifically ablating microspore and megaspore mother cells, the SDS::SDS-BARNASE construct was made by fusing the SDS entire gene with the BARNASE gene (FIG. 1D). We performed three transformations, resulting in 97, 80, and 126 SDS::SDS-BARNASE transgenic plants, respectively. All independent transgenic plants were sterile. We first evaluated the effects of SDS::SDS-BARNASE on growth and development. SDS::SDS-BARNASE transgenic plants produced rosette leaves with the same number, size, and shape as that of WT plants (FIGS. 4A, 4B). No morphological changes were observed in SDS::SDS-BARNASE inflorescences and flowers (FIGS. 4C, 4D). Moreover, mature SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants had a similar height to the wild-type (FIGS. 4E-4G). The flowering time of SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants was not affected either, because the same rosette leaf numbers as the wild-type were produced when flowering (FIG. 4H). To further investigate sterility of SDS::SDS-BARNASE transgenic plants, we analyzed both male and female fertilities. Compared with the wild-type (FIGS. 5A, 5H), SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants produced short siliques (FIGS. 5B, 5I). Except short filaments, SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants formed flowers that were the same as the wild-type, indicated by four sepals, four petals, six stamens, and two carpels (FIGS. 5D, 5E). In the WT flower, pollen grains were released from anthers that reached the stigma (FIG. 5D), whereas in the SDS::SDS-BARNASE flower, no pollen grains were observed on the anther surface and anthers did not reach the stigma (FIG. 5E). Furthermore, different from the WT anther (FIG. 5F), the SDS::SDS-BARNASE anther did not produce pollen grains (FIG. 5G), indicating that SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants were male sterile. Because pollination using the WT pollen did not rescue the fertility (FIGS. 5C, 5J), SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants were female sterile too. Thus, using SDS::SDS-BARNASE, we efficiently created completely both male and female sterile Arabidopsis plants that had normal vegetative and reproductive growth and development, including the formation of all flower organs.",

At stage 5, when compared with the WT anthers (FIG. 6A), the SDS::SDS-BARNASE anther showed vacuolated microsporocytes (microspore mother cells) and tapetal cells (FIG. 6D), indicating the degeneration of both cells. At stage 7 in the WT anther, successful male meiosis resulted in the formation of tetrads (FIG. 6B), whereas in the SDS::SDS-BARNASE anther, tetrads, and tapetal cells were collapsed (FIG. 6E). At stage 9, the WT anther contains developing pollen grains (FIG. 6C), but the SDS::SDS-BARNASE anther lacked developing microspore s (FIG. 6F). In embryo sacs of WT ovules, two nuclei at stage FG3 (FIG. 7A) and four nuclei at stage FG4 (FIG. 7B) were observed; however, in SDS::SDS-BARNASE embryo sacs, only a single nucleus was produced (FIGS. 7D, 7E). At stage FG6, the WT embryo sac showed the central cell, the egg cell, and synergid cells (FIG. 7C), but the SDS::SDS-BARNASE embryo sac is empty (FIG. 7F). Furthermore, our results showed that expressions of tapetal cell marker genes A9 and ATA7 as well as microspore and megaspore mother cell marker genes DMC1 and SWI1 were significantly decreased in SDS::SDS-BARNASE buds in comparison to the wild-type (FIG. 8). In summary, the specific expression of the SDS-BARNASE toxic fusion protein in microspore and megaspore mother cells efficiently impaired the production of both male and female gametes, which led to absolute both male and female sterility, but did not affect flower organ formation or plant growth and development.",
