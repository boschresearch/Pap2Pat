    "title": "Creating Completely Both Male and Female Sterile Plants by Specifically Ablating Microspore and Megaspore Mother Cells",
    "date": "2016-02-01",
    "abstract": "Although genetically modified (GM) plants have improved commercially important traits, such as biomass and biofuel production, digestibility, bioremediation, ornamental value, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, there remain economic, political, or social concerns over potential ecological effects of transgene flow from GM plants. The current solution for preventing transgene flow from GM plants is genetically engineering sterility; however, approaches to generating both male and female sterility are limited. In addition, existing strategies for creating sterility lead to loss or modifications of entire flowers or floral organs. Here, we demonstrate that instead of the 1.5-kb promoter, the entire SOLO DANCERS (SDS) gene is required for its meiocyte-specific expression. We then developed an efficient method to specifically ablate microspore and megaspore mother cells using the SDS and BARNASE fusion gene, which resulted in complete sterility in both male and female reproductive organs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), but did not affect plant growth or development, including the formation of all flower organs. Therefore, our research provides a general and effective tool to prevent transgene flow in GM plants.",

                "Since genetically modified (GM) plants were produced in 1983 (Caplan et al., 1983; Murai et al., 1983), the number of GM plants has been rapidly increasing yearly (Husken et al., 2010). GM trees, turf grasses, biofuel and forage crops, and ornamentals have improved commercially important traits, including biomass and biofuel production, digestibility, bioremediation, ornamental value, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses (Wang and Ge, 2006; Groover, 2007; Harfouche et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; Wang and Brummer, 2012; Wilkerson et al., 2014); however, the approval for commercialization of GM plants is subject to complicated and stringent government regulations due to economic, political, or social concerns over potential ecological effects of transgene flow and floral-modified plantations (Goeschl and Swanson, 2003; Hills et al., 2007; Van Acker et al., 2007; Strauss et al., 2009; Lombardo, 2014).",
                "Transgene flow from GM plants to non-GM plants and wild populations is mainly mediated by dispersal of pollen and seeds. Early studies found that the pollen-mediated gene flew from GM Roundup Ready creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) occurred within 2 to 21 km (Watrud et al., 2004). The non-GM rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) could pollinate the GM creeping bentgrass to produce transgenic intergeneric hybrid offspring, suggesting that the transgene escape is also mediated by the female part of GM plants (Zapiola and Mallory-Smith, 2012). Long distance pollen-mediated gene flow occurred between weed beets (Beta vulgaris) as far as 9.6 km and the resulting interfield gene flow was unavoidable (Fenart et al., 2007). Pollen migration from poplars (Populus trichocarpa) often went beyond 10 km (Slavov et al., 2009; DiFazio et al., 2012), indicating that similar issues happened in GM trees. Moreover, gene flow from GM crops to native populations was detected in maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and canola (Brassica napus; Pineyro-Nelson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010b; Rieben et al., 2011; Wang and Li, 2012). To overcome regulatory hurdles to field research and, ultimately, commercial uses of GM plants, a practical solution is to create sterile plants by ablating floral organs/tissues using toxic genes under control of specific promoters or by altering flowering time and floral organs via manipulating genes critical for flower development.",
                "Strategies on making male sterility have been extensively and successfully employed to prevent the pollen-mediated transgene flow. In the male reproduction organ anther, tapetum is a layer of nutritive cells, which is required for pollen development. Therefore, genetic ablation of tapetal cells by tapetum-specific promoters driven toxic genes, such as ribonuclease BARNASE and diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) genes, is commonly used to create male sterility in various plants. The widely used tobacco tapetum promoter TA29 was first employed to drive BARNASE to create male sterile tobacco and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) plants (Mariani et al., 1990). TA29::DTA tobacco transgenic plants are also male sterile (Koltunow et al., 1990). Since then, various male sterile plants were achieved using other tapetum or anther-specific promoters, including A9, A6, E1, T72, PS1, and PsEND1 in Arabidopsis, rapeseed (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), and pea (Pisum sativum) plants (Paul et al., 1992; Hird et al., 1993; Zhan et al., 1996; DeBlock et al., 1997; Roque et al., 2007). This strategy was also applied to perennial grasses and trees. The TAP::BARNASE creeping bentgrass is completely pollen sterile (Luo et al., 2005). PrMC2, a pine male cone-specific gene, was successfully used to generate male sterile pine (Pinus radiata) and Eucalyptus (sp.) plants by driving a modified BARNASE gene (Zhang et al., 2012). It was recently reported that the TA29::BARNASE transgenic poplar constantly showed robust male sterility during a 4-year field trial (Elorriaga et al., 2014). Attempts were also made to abolish male and female fertility together. In Arabidopsis, BARNASE driven by the second intron of AGAMOUS resulted in ablation of stamens and carpels (Liu and Liu, 2008). Male and female sterile tobacco plants were generated by expressing BARNASE under control of both the tapetum promoter p108 and the transmitting tract promoter sp41 (Gardner et al., 2009).",
                "In addition, manipulating genes regulating flowering time, floral meristem identify, floral organ identity, and floral organ establishment is used to abolish plant fertility. Silencing the tobacco LEAFY genes NFL1 and NFL2 resulted in plants without flowers (An et al., 2011). Tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum) AGAMOUS RNAi lines showed \u201cfruit-in-fruit\u201d phenotype, but did not produce seeds (Pan et al., 2010). Down-regulation of APETALA3 genes OsMADS16 and MtNMH7 caused stamen to carpel transformation and male sterility in rice and Medicago truncatula, respectively (Xiao et al., 2003; Roque et al., 2013). Expression of TFL1, a strong floral repressing gene, led to the non-flowering phenotype in red fescue (Festuca rubra; Jensen et al., 2004). Moreover, overexpression of miR156 inhibited flowering in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum; Fu et al., 2012). Besides generating sterile plants, plastid transformation is also an excellent approach to prevent pollen-mediated transgene flow, since plastids, including chloroplasts, are maternally inherited in most plants (Ruf et al., 2007; Wani et al., 2010).",
                "Although male sterility has been successfully achieved via different approaches in various plant species, it cannot completely prevent transgene flow. Seed development in male sterile GM plants can be rescued by the long-distance transfer of pollen from non-GM plants. The same is also true for female sterile GM plants which disperse pollen to non-GM or male sterile GM plants. Thus, completely abolishing both male and female fertility is the only fail-safe way to prevent transgene flow (Stewart, 2007). So far, approaches to generating complete both male and female sterility are limited. Moreover, existing strategies for creating male and/or female sterility lead to loss or modifications of entire flowers or floral organs (Xiao et al., 2003; Roque et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2010; An et al., 2011), which may cause potential ecological effects on biodiversity of species associated with flowers, such as insects. In economically interesting species, for example ornamentals, altered flowers may also be undesirable. Furthermore, since the remaining toxicity of BARNASE or DTA in non-target organs due to the non-specific basal activities of employed promoters often inhibits plant survival and growth (Lannanpaa et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2007), it is difficult to obtain usable sterile plants that have normal biomass and yield. Therefore, it is imperative to generate sterility in both male and female reproductive organs without affecting plant growth or modifying flower structure.",
                "In Arabidopsis, the SOLO DANCERS (SDS) gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific cyclin, is required for homolog interaction during meiotic prophase I in Arabidopsis (Azumi et al., 2002). With normal growth and development, the sds mutant is both male and female sterile. RNA in situ hybridization analysis showed that SDS transcripts were specifically present in microspore mother cells (male meiocytes) in anthers and megaspore mother cells (female meiocytes) in ovules (Azumi et al., 2002). Here, we report our new approach to create complete both male and female sterility in Arabidopsis and tobacco by specifically ablating microspore and megaspore mother cells using the SDS and BARNASE fusion gene. Our research provides a general and effective tool to prevent transgene flow in GM plants."

At stage 9, the WT anther contains developing pollen grains (Figure 6C), but the SDS::SDS-BARNASE anther lacked developing microspores (Figure 6F).",
                        "In embryo sacs of WT ovules, two nuclei at stage FG3 (Pagnussat et al., 2009) (Figure 7A) and four nuclei at stage FG4 (Figure 7B) were observed; however, in SDS::SDS-BARNASE embryo sacs, only a single nucleus was produced (Figures 7D,E). At stage FG6, the WT embryo sac showed the central cell, the egg cell, and synergid cells (Figure 7C), but the SDS::SDS-BARNASE embryo sac is empty (Figure 7F).",
                        "Furthermore, our results showed that expressions of tapetal cell marker genes A9 and ATA7 as well as microspore and megaspore mother cell marker genes DMC1 and SWI1 were significantly decreased in SDS::SDS-BARNASE buds in comparison to the wild type (Figure 8). In summary, the specific expression of the SDS-BARNASE toxic fusion protein in microspore and megaspore mother cells efficiently impaired the production of both male and female gametes, which led to absolute both male and female sterility, but did not affect flower organ formation or plant growth and development."

                        "To test whether SDS::SDS-BARNASE can provide a general tool to create both male and female sterile plants, we transformed it into tobacco and generated SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco transgenic plants by tissue culture. Among 14 examined SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco transgenic lines, leaf shape and size (Figures 9A\u2013C), as well as the plant height (Figures 9B\u2013D) were the same as that of WT plants. In addition, the SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco flower had the same size, color, and structure as that of wild type (Figures 9E,F). Therefore, SDS::SDS-BARNASE did not affect growth or development in tobacco plants.",
                        "Ten examined SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco transgenic lines were completely sterile. WT tobacco plants produced large fruits and per fruit averagely contained 0.11 g of seeds (Figures 10A,D). Conversely, SDS::SDS-BARNASE plants produced small fruits and no seeds were found when self-pollenated (Figures 10B,D, e.g., plants #1, 3, 5, and 7). Further pollen viability analysis showed that WT tobacco anthers produced viable pollen, indicated by red color (Figure 10E), whereas anthers from sterile tobacco plants either lacked pollen grains (Figure 10F) or formed dead pollen grains (Figure 10G). The four non-absolutely sterile lines produced a few seeds (Figure 10D, e.g., plants #2, and 14) and only some functional pollen grains were found in anthers of those lines (Figure 10H, e.g., plant #2). Our results suggest that SDS::SDS-BARNASE impaired male fertility in tobacco.",
                        "We then examined the female fertility in sterile tobacco transgenic plants. The fertility of manually male-sterilized WT flowers could be rescued by cross-pollination with WT pollen (Figure 10D), but following cross-pollination with WT pollen, the fruit size of SDS::SDS-BARNASE sterile tobacco plants did not change (Figure 10C) and no seeds were produced (Figure 10D, e.g., plants #1, 3, and 5). Thus, SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco transgenic plants were also female sterile. Manual pollination partially rescued the fertility of line #7, indicating that the line #7 is a completely male but partially female sterile plant, while lines #2 and 14 were nearly male and female sterile plants (Figure 10D). Collectively, a majority of SDS::SDS-BARNASE tobacco transgenic plants were completely male and female sterile, suggesting that SDS::SDS-BARNASE is functionally conserved, which can be used to create both male and female sterility in general."

                "SOLO DANCERS, a unique type of (SDS-type) meiosis-specific cyclin, is conserved in flowering plants (Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015). In our studies, the 1.5-kb SDS promoter did not achieve the specific expression of SDS in either microspore or megaspore mother cells. Conversely, the entire SDS gene genomic fragment did. The intron-dependent spatial expression has been revealed in different genes from various species, including SUS3 and SUS4 in potato (Fu et al., 1995a,b), OsTubA1 in rice (Jeon et al., 2000; Giani et al., 2009), PhADF1 in petunia (Jeong et al., 2007), as well as AGAMOUS, ACT1 and PRF in Arabidopsis (An et al., 1996; Sieburth and Meyerowitz, 1997; Jeong et al., 2006). Therefore, it is possible that regulatory motifs in SDS introns contribute to its specific spatial and temporal expression. Future studies should be focused on dissecting the functions of unknown regulatory motifs and then making a synthetic promoter that confers the strong and specific expression of SDS in microspore and megaspore mother cells. We found a few non-completely sterile tobacco transgenic plants, suggesting that the Arabidopsis SDS gene did not work efficiently in tobacco. In order to achieve accurate and efficient ablation effects, it would be more practical to use SDS orthologous genes of target species or the synthetic promoter to drive BARNASE.",
                "The existing methods for creating male sterile only GM plants are not able to completely prevent transgene flow, because pollen from non-GM plants can rescue seed development. In addition, current sterilization technologies either suppress the production of entire flower or some floral organs, which may cause potential ecological effects besides transgene flow. Furthermore, BARNASE and DTA are very toxic. Many \u201cspecific\u201d promoters still have basal activities in other organs; therefore, the low expression of BARNASE/DTA in non-target organs often reduces plant survival rate and inhibits plant growth. Microspore and megaspore mother cells are two small groups of male and female reproductive cells, which are differentiated after all floral organs are established. Ablating microspore and megaspore mother cells only leads to elimination of male and female gametes, but it does not affect other somatic cell differentiation and flower development. In this study, we specifically ablated microspore and megaspore mother cells using the SDS and BARNASE fusion protein. Thus, our research developed an efficient strategy to successfully create completely both male and female sterile plants; however, the plant growth and development, including the formation of all flower organs, were not affected.",
                "Genetically modified crops have been widely cultivated in many countries due to their improved agronomic traits; however, the adoption of GM trees (e.g., poplar, eucalypts, and pines) and perennial grasses (e.g., miscanthus and switchgrass) is limited, because those plants are long-lived, weakly domesticated, and important to ecosystems. Various studies has been done to increase cold tolerance and biomass, modify lignin and cellulose biosynthesis, or alter growth and flowering of Eucalyptus (Girijashankar, 2011; Hinchee et al., 2011; Klocko et al., 2015), aspen (Etchells et al., 2015), poplar (Wilkerson et al., 2014), and switchgrass (Fu et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2013; Baxter et al., 2014; Poovaiah et al., 2015). Our research developed a general and effective approach to create completely both male and female sterile plants by specifically ablating microspore and megaspore mother cells, which provides a solution for overcoming regulatory hurdles to field research and ultimately commercial uses of GM plants.",
                "Besides the transgene containment, our method can be applied for modifying invasive and ornamental plants. Male and female sterilized invasive plants generated by our method can be planted for multiple purposes, such as forestry and horticulture. The main valuable trait for many ornamental trees, such as cherries and plums, is the beauty of flowers. Fruits often make the garden messy. Moreover, nutrient competition from fruit setting affects flower organ differentiation, and consequently reduces flower numbers in the coming year. Our new method serves as an excellent tool to engineer ornamental trees that still produce attractive intact flowers without fruit setting, which, therefore, maintains their ornamental value."
