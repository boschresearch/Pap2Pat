Recent advances in hybridizing metasurfaces with optically active materials and correlated oxides have particularly attracted widespread attention due to the ability to engineer novel functionalities that are actively tunable. Tunable polaritonic metasurfaces have been pursued for reconfigurable nano-optic functionalities in compact devices3. One strategy is to apply the phase-change media as the substrate of emerging van der Waal nanomaterials, thus efficiently modulating the phonon polariton (PhPs)4-6. For instance, the hyperbolic PhPs (HPhPs), i.e. the PhPs following a hyperbolic dispersion in anisotropic crystals with at least two components of polarizability tensor of different signs, can be changed via the phase change substrate3,7,8. So far, such tunable polaritons via phase change materials that rely on the temperature as the seed introduces loss, as the phonon lifetime is reduced when the temperature and hence the phonon-phonon scattering events increase. In addition, this route suffers from inaccessibility of nanoscale manipulation due to limited way for localized thermal manipulations. As a result, reconfigurability of nanopolaritonic metasurface remains limited."

                        "Correlated oxides provide enormous advantages to engineer meta-devices due to their highly tunable optical and electronic properties9-11. Among these, the rare-earth nickelates (RNiO3, R=rare-earth element) display a rich phase diagram of structural and physical properties12-15, controllable via various approaches, including doping, temperature, atomic vacancies, electrical bias, etc. Hence, those media have been investigated for applications as configurable nanoelectronics, fuel cells, and memristor devices16-20. SmNiO3 (SNO) nickelate is unique in the rare-earth nickelate family because it displays phase transition above room temperature and is extremely sensitive to the orbital occupancy of electrons and carrier doping, exhibiting a huge change (more than eight orders of magnitude) in electrical resistivity and an order of magnitude in optical band gap during metal-insulator phase transition (MIT)23. These properties enable SNO enormously and reversibly to change its refractive index over ultrabroad frequency ranges, which have been utilized for nanophotonics applications including the electro-optic modulators for controllable scattering characteristics23 while tremendous new opportunities remain unveiled.",
                        "Accordingly, disclosed herein is a correlated oxide meta-structure with on-demand and multimode programming of polaritons at the nanoscale, which is largely tunable via field generated oxygen vacancies, hydrogen doping, and/or temperature modulation. Presented herein is the characterization as well as manipulation of optical properties of SNO. Also provided are case studies of two prototypical hyperbolic van der Waals crystals hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (\u03b1-MoO3), which showcases the rich dispersion engineering of HPhPs, enabling diverse control and patterning of PhPs.",
                        "Accordingly, this disclosure reveals the promise of tunable correlated oxides metasurfaces for future configurable and tailorable nanophotonic technologies. The samples used for this work are SNO grown by magnetron co-sputtering on a LaAlO3 substrate, and subsequently annealed in high pressure oxygen gas (see Methods for the detailed process). For example, a metasurface structure herein includes the correlated oxide SNO grown on a substrate LaAlO3. Using conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), we apply voltage on the surface so that a desired pattern is made. For example, the pattern can be either a geometrical shape consisting of several lines, a rectangular 12 \u03bcm*6 \u03bcm (FIG. 1B), a square 1 \u03bcm*1 \u03bcm (FIG. 2c), a triangle with 9 \u03bcm side (FIG. 6d, 6e), a circle 5 \u03bcm diameter (FIG. 9a-c) or a desirable shape like an animal figure (FIG. 6g-i). Applying a positive voltage results in a region with large resistivity on SNO (see Methods). Then a flake of van der Waals hyperbolic phononic exfoliable material like hBN or \u03b1-MoO3 of desirable thickness (e.g. for hBN the thickness is 60 nm and \u03b1-MoO3 is 120 nm) is transferred on top of the writing region on SNO surface using a homemade flake transfer setup24.",
                        "Accordingly, a metasurface according to principles described herein may include correlated oxide on a substrate and a wiring pattern of predetermined geometric shape on the surface thereof. There is a flake of van der Waals phononic exfoliable material on top of the wiring pattern/region. The wiring pattern may be formed by c-AFM or any other appropriate methods25.",
                        "Depending on the material which is transferred on SNO-Writing region, either a hyperbolic phonon polariton (hBN) or anisotropic phonon polariton (\u03b1-MoO3), could be produced. The region of low conductivity can be manipulated in real-time either via temperature modulation or spontaneous hydrogenation too (FIG. 2, 3). For this step, first, the writing patterns are made, then using a homemade enclosure that is placed on a heater, we expose the SNO to H2 (5%). To modulate the writing regions via temperature and capturing with s-SNOM, we used a homemade heating setup which is placed in the microscope, and we can measure through the near-field imaging.",

For example, using NNO the conductive pattern can be made using c-AFM and changed the surface to a desirable shape of insulating phase which is suitable for our device; however, on the LAO/STO surface c-AFM leads to an electron confinement between the layers so that a desirable shape of metallic/insulting phase can be made on the surface32.",

                        "To write square charge patterns on the SNO sample (topography shown in FIG. 2b), we applied strong local fields via c-AFM operated in contact mode, detection setpoint 0.2 V, scan rate 0.5 Hz, and spring constant of the tip 2 N/m. Subsequently, we map the surface potential of written areas using KPFM operated in tapping mode with an amplitude of 500 mV (see methods). The positive bias voltage in all writings led to a large potential compared to the pristine SNO as reflected in bright images in FIG. 2C. A large positive biased tip results in more desorption of surface adatoms and dissociates surface atoms, and the removal of oxygen from the SNO surface, providing a controllable route to manipulate the surface conductivity of SNO via the generation of oxygen vacancies33. This charge writing behavior is also reversible with a negative bias33.",
                        "We show in FIG. 2H a plot of normalized potential (the potential of the square writings (Vwriting) divided by the potential of the pristine SNO (VSNO), the surface potential difference of the patterned areas increases with the tip bias voltage commensurate with the change in local conductivity.",
                        "To quantitatively assess the local conductivity changes of the charge writing process, we performed s-SNOM imaging of the same area of the sample. S-SNOM maps local conductivity changes with high-sensitivity and high-spatial resolution only limited by the sharpness of the probe tip34-37. Focused infrared laser on a metalized cantilevered AFM tip with tapping frequency \u03a9 interacts with the sample and the scattered light from this interaction is demodulated at higher harmonics n\u03a9 of the tapping frequency and detected via phase modulation interferometer (see methods for more detail). The resulting s-SNOM amplitude images are shown in FIG. 2D-G were taken at 10 \u03bcm laser wavelength and show voltage dependence optical contrast. Such s-SNOM image contrast directly reflects local conductivity changes36 of the sample where dark regions, i.e. the area written with positive biases, imply lower conductivity compared to the pristine (red) region (FIG. 2D-G) due to the removal of oxygen from the SNO surface. Increasing bias voltage results in decreasing the local near-field amplitude (local conductivity) as shown in the plot in FIG. 2i of the normalized amplitude (amplitude of the square writings (s2(writing)) divided by the amplitude of the pristine SNO (s2(SNO)). The combination of charge writing with c-AFM and optical imaging of local electronic changes by s-SNOM opens an exciting prospect for local conductivity lithographic patterning that could be of use in nanophotonics.",
                        "In addition to voltage dopant control, the local conductivity of SNO can be further tuned via temperature modulation or spontaneous hydrogenation, which also induces the metal-insulator phase transition MIT33. We first investigate the temperature dependence of the pristine and written charge areas by mapping the IR near-field local response of the film. To that end, the sample was heated in situ at different temperatures on a custom-built heating stage integrated with the s-SNOM setup. After thermal equilibrium is reached (which is achieved by keeping the system at the selected temperature for 15 min), near-field images of the sample are taken. In FIGS. 2d and 1e we show two amplitude images taken at room (23\u00b0 C.) and high temperature (82\u00b0 C.) respectively (a series of images in different temperatures are shown in FIG. 3a-h).",

                        "Unlike most metals, for correlated oxides like SNO increasing temperature or disorder does not hasten the electron scattering process and decrease the electronic conductivity. Instead, increasing temperature results in increasing conductivity22. This is captured in FIG. 2H, which shows a linear normalized near-field amplitude plot as a function of temperature revealing increasing amplitude, commensurate with increasing conductivity, as temperature increases. However, the charge written areas do not show a similar trend; instead, the measured change in normalized amplitude with temperature is weak (see FIGS. 5A-B) owing to reduced oxygen content.",
                        "FIGS. 5A-5B show conductive writing manipulation by temperature change compared to SNO. FIG. 5A shows normalized amplitude s2(writing)/s2(SNO) without exposing to H2 for different temperatures.

                        "These dissimilar changes in conductivity between the pristine and charge written areas remarkably resulted in making the invisible charge written marking at low voltage (e.g., 5 V) visible in s-SNOM amplitude image as shown in FIG. 2E. Oxygen vacancies affect the electron occupancy (donate electrons to Ni-site eg orbitals) and electron-electron correlation energy and band gap in SNO, which modulated the MIT behavior. s-SNOM images provide a direct and facile way to monitor these modulations.",
                        "Hydrogen dopants provide another robust and sensitive route to dramatically modify the electronic phases of SNO16. We manipulate the local conductivity of pristine and written charge patterns of SNO by spontaneous hydrogen incorporation and then record in-situ the nanoscale changes via infrared s-SNOM imaging. The sample (that has written charge and pristine areas) is exposed to H2 (using forming gas which is 5% H2 and 95% N2) for 30 minutes, while simultaneously heating the sample at 100\u00b0 C. in a closed chamber. After hydrogen doping, the sample was cooled to room temperature and subsequent s-SNOM mapping was conducted as a function of temperature. Normalized amplitude s-SNOM plots of the pristine area of SNO as a function of temperature with and without hydrogen exposure are shown in FIG. 2H. A large resistance drop, compared to the pristine area, is observed in the hydrogenated sample at all temperatures due to modification of the electron configuration of, e.g., orbital of SNO21. Change in temperature also affects the charge written areas resulting in a large increase of conductivity at high temperatures (FIGS. 5A-B).",

The detailed modeling technique is provided in the method section. Our results also show a sharp difference of polaritons propagating into and out to triangle cavity (FIG. 6D), further confirming the distinguished properties of SNO in a different phase and hence the large configurability of polaritons. Moreover, different near-field images can be arbitrarily created via our modified SNO. FIGS. 6G-6I show a pattern written on SNO and imaged at 6.9 \u03bcm laser wavelength with and without hBN flake (thickness 50) on top of SNO, demonstrating desired metasurfaces by imaging at polariton wavelength (FIG. 6H) or outside the range of HPhP wavelength (FIG. 6I). These examples show that a simple tip-based high-resolution patterning of the oxide surface, instead of complicated fabrication of vdW materials themselves or substrates could provide a tailorable polariton cavity and other desired designs, allowing us to tailor the on-demand configuration of polariton configurations.",

The dispersion of those materials can be engineered by intercalation47,49,50 or the twist41, 51. Here, we point out another avenue of tunable dispersion of in-plane anisotropic PhPs via our largely tunable correlated oxide metasurfaces, a reconfigurable substrate that provides nanoscale on-demand dielectric patterns enabling the active manipulation of nano-confined fields.

                        "In FIG. 9A, we observed the elliptical shape with the largest PhPs wavelength along the [001] (blue plot in FIG. 9A) and the smaller value along the [100] (green plot in FIG. 9A). More importantly, as we go to the L-RB (around 10.76 \u03bcm) the interference patterns show an almond shape (FIG. 9C) with the largest wavelength along the [100] and almost no propagation along the orthogonal [001] direction, which is in agreement with the latest findings38. In those images, one could notice that HPhPs mostly propagate inside the dielectric-phase SNO, being confined, while the dramatic differences of the fringe periodicity are observed inside and outside of SNO circles. Furthermore, in FIGS. 9D-9F we show hyperbolic modes on square patterns that are twisted 45\u00b0 angle from the sample axis [001] as shown in FIG. 9D for the 10.1 \u03bcm, 10.05 \u03bcm, and 10 \u03bcm laser wavelength, respectively. HPH reflecting from edges propagate with almost the same wavelength at L-RB, while that in twisted angle of 45\u00b0 with respect to the [001] axis the anisotropy is not seen, exhibiting the similar patterns and behaviors with recent findings using the \u03b1-MoO3 nanocavities40 and suggesting the realized nanocavities using the shaped dielectric substrate.",

The large changes of momentum in different reststrahlen bands of \u03b1-MoO3 are observed, suggesting the various confinement of polaritons and different levels of light-matter interactions. Furthermore, the topological transitions may also be available if one further extends the possible permittivity range to the negative values, as demonstrated in recent findings of \u03b1-MoO3 on top of negative-permittivity substrate52,53, which could be studied in future work.",

We used the Cypher AFM (Oxford instrument) to acquire c-AFM and SKPM. In order to make the lithography (writing) pattern using c-AFM (FIGS. 1A-D, 2A-2I, and 3A-3H), a contacted mode AFM was performed while applying 5V-10V through a metal Ti/Ir coated tip (Asyelectric.01-R2 from Oxford instrument). In c-AFM, the current is passed through the tip and into a transimpedance amplifier, and it converts current to a voltage.",
                        "Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a technique that detects the potential difference between the probe and the sample. This technique is based on the AC bias applied to the tip to produce an electric force on the cantilever, which is proportional to the potential difference between the tip and the sample. Using an AC bias, the probe is driven electrically and the potential difference between the tip and the sample causes the probe to oscillate. These oscillations are canceled by a potential feedback loop, and the voltage required to match the probe to the sample is recorded as the surface potential in the software.",

The experimental setup (FIG. 1B, neaspec co.) is based on a tapping mode AFM with a cantilevered metal-coated tip that oscillates at a resonance frequency \u03a9\u02dc280 kHz and tapping amplitude of \u02dc100 nm. Either a coherent broadband infrared beam in the frequency range 700-2100 cm\u22121 (for nano-FTIR) or a monochromatic IR laser (for s-SNOM) is focused by a parabolic mirror to the tip. For nano-FTIR operation, the backscattered near-field light from the tip-sample junction is detected via mixing with an asymmetric Fourier transform Michelson interferometer. This detection method enables recording of both the amplitude s(\u03c9) and phase \u03c6(\u03c9) spectra of the backscattered light. To extract background free local near-fields, the detector signal is demodulated at a higher harmonic n\u03a9 of the tip mechanical resonance frequency \u03a9. Normalized amplitude (sn(sample)/sn(reference)) and phase (\u03c6n(sample)\u2212\u03c6n(reference)) IR near-field spectra are acquired by first taking reference spectrum on a reference area (silicon is used in these experiments), followed by taking spectra at desired positions of the sample.
