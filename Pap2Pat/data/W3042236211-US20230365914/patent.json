                        "Infection with protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea in the developing world. Research on this parasite has been impeded by many technical limitations, including the lack of cryopreservation methods. While cryopreservation of Cryptosporidium oocysts by vitrification can be achieved, the method is restricted to small sample volumes of only 2 \u03bcL, thereby limiting the usefulness of this procedure. It is therefore of interest to develop new methods and devices for vitrification of large sample volumes of Cryptosporidium oocysts, which will aid research efforts on this parasite, for example, by enabling the sharing of isolates among different laboratories and the standardizing of clinical trials."

                        "The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the development of methods and devices for high-volume cryopreservation of cells by vitrification that increased the volume of a single cryopreserved sample of Cryptosporidium oocysts by 100-fold compared to known techniques such as those involving microcapillaries.",
                        "Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and infant death in low- and middle-income countries. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study identified infection with Cryptosporidium parasites as the second most common cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in infants in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia (Kotloff et al., Burden and aetiology of diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children in developing countries (the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, GEMS): a prospective, case-control study. Lancet 382, 209-222 (2013). In this setting, cryptosporidiosis is strongly associated with death of infants and toddlers (Kotloff et al., Burden and aetiology of diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children in developing countries (the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, GEMS): a prospective, case-control study. Lancet 382, 209-222 (2013); Molbak et al., Cryptosporidiosis in infancy and childhood mortality in Guinea Bissau, west Africa. BMJ 307, 417-420 (1993)). In fact, acute cryptosporidiosis caused >48,000 deaths among children below the age of five in 2016 alone, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study (Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 328 diseases and injuries for 195 countries, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. Lancet 390, 1211-1259 (2017)). Long-term consequences of early childhood cryptosporidiosis are related to malabsorption and undernutrition and include cognitive impairment and stunted growth (Checkley et al., Effects of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in Peruvian children: growth faltering and subsequent catch-up growth. Am. J. Epidemiol. 148, 497-506 (1998); Guerrant et al., Association of early childhood diarrhea and cryptosporidiosis with impaired physical fitness and cognitive function four-seven years later in a poor urban community in northeast brazil. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 61, 707-713 (1999)). It is estimated that burden from cryptosporidiosis, adjusted for undernutrition, accounted for more than 12 million disability-adjusted life\u2014years in 2016 (Khalil et al., Morbidity, mortality, and long-term consequences associated with diarrhoea from Cryptosporidium infection in children younger than 5 years: a meta-analyses study. Lancet Glob. Health 6, e758-e768 (2018)). Additionally, cryptosporidiosis is also a key opportunistic infection among immunocompromised individuals, responsible for life-threatening persistent diarrhea (Tzipori & Widmer, A hundred-year retrospective on cryptosporidiosis. Trends Parasitol. 24, 184-189 (2008)). In industrialized countries, prevalence of cryptosporidiosis is on the rise with a 13% increase in the number of outbreaks per year in the USA (Gharpure et al., Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks\u2014United States, 2009-2017. MMWR Morb. Mortal Wkly. Rep. 68, 568-572 (2019)).",
                        "Current anti-parasitic drugs are ineffective and no vaccine is available to control cryptosporidiosis. This highlights the need to develop vaccines, better therapeutics and diagnostic tools for the disease. Until recently, a major technical limitation to research on cryptosporidiosis was the lack of methods for cryopreserving the parasite. In the absence of such methods, laboratory strains of Cryptosporidium are continuously propagated in laboratory animals (e.g., calves, pigs and rodents) every 6-8 weeks. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and has for years limited the sharing of well-characterized isolates among laboratories. This further precludes execution of clinical trials with standardized parasite preparations and hinders the development and evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines.",
                        "Scientists have attempted to cryopreserve infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts for decades without much success. These poor outcomes may be due in part to insufficient loading of cryoprotective agents (CPAs, e.g., dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol). Specifically, the complex tetralaminar oocyst wall shielding sporozoites, the fragile invasive stage of the parasite, also prevents effective CPA loading. Another reason for these poor outcomes may be the toxicity of CPAs, which can compromise the viability and infectivity of oocysts that have been exposed to these toxic agents. Some methods such as vitrification utilize high concentrations of CPAs (\u02dc4-8 M), which is combined with rapid cooling rates to achieve formation of an amorphous glassy state that is devoid of ice crystals.",
                        "Accordingly, described herein are cryopreservation methods that increase the intracellular concentrations of CPAs while minimizing cytotoxicity to enable increased sample volume through the design and manufacture of novel high aspect ratio specimen containers referred to as \u201cvitrification cassettes.\u201d This strategy increases the volume of a single cryopreserved sample by at least 100-fold compared to the previously reported microcapillaries. This volume is sufficient to produce multiple inocula from a single cryopreserved sample (e.g., 4 doses for pigs or >20 human doses for clinical trials), thus overcoming a major bottleneck in the development and testing of therapeutics for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis."

                                "The cryopreservation methods described herein can be used to cryopreserve a high-volume of cells that can later be used in a wide range of downstream applications. For example, the methods can be used to cryopreserve therapeutic cells (e.g., stem cells, T cells), which can then be used for cell-based therapies, cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. In another example, the methods can be used to cryopreserve unicellular or multicellular organisms such as parasites (e.g., parasites in the form of infectious oocysts), which can then be used for research and development of therapeutics and diagnostic tools for treating patients infected with such organisms.",
                                "To practice the methods described herein, a plurality of cells is mixed with a vitrification solution comprising a dehydrating agent and one or more cryoprotective agents, loaded into a vitrification cassette, and rapidly cooled for a time and under conditions sufficient to cause vitrification of the plurality of cells.",
                                "The cells can be added to the vitrification solution or the vitrification solution can be added to the cells. Alternatively, the cell media is modified to include all the components needed for vitrification. The concentration of the cells in the vitrification solution can vary depending on the type of cells and on the downstream use of the cells. For example, for oocysts (e.g., Cryptosporidium oocysts) for use in laboratory research and clinical trials, the concentration of cells in the vitrification solution can be between 5,000 to 100,000 cells/\u03bcL.",
                                "The vitrification solution can include any physiologic solution such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or cell media. The vitrification solution can be supplemented with one or more components including, but not limited to, serum, proteins, penicillin/streptomycin, lipids, salts, formamide, methoxylated compounds, polymers (e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol), cryoprotective agents, dehydrating agents (e.g., sugars, salts, or a combination thereof), or combinations thereof.",
                                "Prior to loading into the vitrification cassette, the cells are incubated in a vitrification solution comprising a dehydrating agent under conditions and for a time sufficient to promote dehydration of the cells. For example, when the dehydrating agent is trehalose, the cells are incubated in a vitrification solution comprising 0.5 to 2.5 M trehalose (e.g., 1.6 M trehalose) for 5 to 20 minutes (e.g., 10 minutes) at room temperature.",
                                "One or more cryoprotective agents are then added to the vitrification solution and the cells are incubated under conditions and for a time sufficient for uptake (or loading) of the cryoprotective agent by the dehydrated cells.",
                                "The total concentration of the one or more cryoprotective agents in the vitrification solution is then increased by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25% or more prior to loading the cells in the vitrification solution into the vitrification cassette. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the concentration of the one or more cryoprotective agents within the cells increases as a result of water loss caused by the osmotic gradient applied during the second addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents.",
                                "Accordingly, methods described herein comprise step-wise addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents. For example, when the one or more cryoprotective agents is DMSO, a stock solution of DMSO is added to the vitrification solution to achieve a concentration of 25% to 35% v/v DMSO/vitrification solution, and then the cells are incubated for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature. Following incubation, the concentration of DMSO in the vitrification solution is increased to 45% to 55% v/v DMSO/vitrification solution, and then the cells in the vitrification solution are loaded into the vitrification cassette. When using multiple cryoprotective agents, the concentration of the combination of all cryoprotective agents in the vitrification solution during step-wise addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents is between 25 to 35% (v/v) for the first step and between 45 to 55% (v/v) for the second step.",
                                "In some examples, the step-wise addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents decreases the concentration of the dehydrating agent in the vitrification solution. For example, when the dehydrating agent is trehalose, the concentration of the trehalose in the vitrification solution is decreased by the first addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents (e.g., the concentration of trehalose is decreased from 1.6 M to 0.8 M) and then further decreased by the second addition of the one or more cryoprotective agents (e.g., the concentration of trehalose is decreased from 0.8 M to 0.5 M).",
                                "Methods described herein also include treating the cells with a permeabilizing agent to increase uptake of the cryoprotective agent. Such methods are useful for cells that have an impermeable nature such as oocysts, which have an oocyst wall that is resistant to mechanical and chemical damage.",
                                "In such instances, prior to incubating the cells in the vitrification solution, the cells are exposed to a permeabilization solution comprising a permeabilizing agent for a time and under conditions sufficient to increase uptake of the cryoprotective agent by the cells compared to uptake of the cryoprotective agent by untreated cells. For example, the cells are exposed to 10% to 30% hypochlorite (e.g., 20% hypochlorite) for 10 seconds to 5 minutes (e.g., 1 minute) on ice, and then washed with PBS.",
                                "The cells are loaded into the vitrification cassette, for example, by loading the cells onto the cassette port and aspirating the cells into the cassette via negative pressure created by removing the air from the opposite cassette port. In some examples, the port(s) is sealed with a polymeric seal or an adhesive seal prior to submerging the vitrification cassette into liquid nitrogen.",
                                "The volume of vitrification solution loaded into the chamber of the vitrification cassette can depend on various factors such as the volume of the chamber, the type of cells, the downstream use of the cells, and combinations thereof.",

The materials of the three layers are selected to have matching thermal expansion coefficients. These layers are each about 200 \u03bcm, but may be thicker or thinner to provide additional mechanical stability or reduced thermal mass. The middle layer is cut out to form the walls of a chamber, which is meant to contain the sample. The material is transparent to allow visual inspection of the chamber. The sample is loaded and unloaded by way of two ports, which are cut into the top sheet. Flexible gaskets are used to seal against the sheets, and to facilitate loading and unloading of the sample via these ports. The sample is retained within the gasket by capillary forces, but adhesive sheets can also be used to seal the ports. Prior to use, the ports are sealed by a disposable adhesive layer to protect the chamber from contamination. The chamber is laid out within the sandwich in a pattern that aids in loading and unloading of the sample. The planar geometry allows rapid heat exchange by high surface area to volume ratio, while also allowing large internal volumes relative to a capillary geometry. Heat is almost entirely exchanged along the normal axis, so the length and height of the device may be increased to accommodate larger sample volumes without greatly impacting heat exchange rate. The planar components are easy to manufacture and assemble, so the device can be produced in large volumes by reel-to-reel manufacturing processes."

J Infect. Dis. 185, 1320-1325 (2002))) were generated at the Tufts University by infection of four 8-week-old female CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Propagation of oocysts in mice was conducted in an institution accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) in compliance with the study protocol No. G2017-107 approved by the Tufts University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council).",
                                "Mice were grouped in bedded microisolators with access to food and water ad libitum. Mice were immunosuppressed throughout the course of experiment by administration of dexamethasone in drinking water at a concentration 16 mg/L. After three days of immunosuppressive treatment, each mouse received 50,000 oocysts in a PBS suspension by oral gavage. Starting from 5 DPI, which marks onset of fecal oocyst shedding, mice were kept in collection microisolators during the night for collection of fecal material and then rested in bedded microisolators during the day, both with access to food and water ad libitum. At termination of the experiment on 15 DPI, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation as required by the Tufts University IACUC guidelines. Oocysts were purified from mice feces by ether extraction and separated on a nycodenz gradient, as described elsewhere (Widmer, et al. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Cryptosporidium parvum isolates from people with AIDS. J. Infect. Dis. 178, 834-840 (1998)) with minor modifications. Briefly, homogenized fecal slurry was filtered through a 100 \u03bcm cell strainer and treated with diethyl ether in water containing 0.5% Tween 80 at the ratio 2:3. Oocysts were isolated by ultracentrifugation (13,400\u00d7g, 60 min) on a 10%/25% nycodenz gradient. Harvested oocysts were then resuspended in PBS and stored in 4\u00b0 C. For consecutive propagation of fresh oocysts, intestines collected post-mortem from the positive control IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) infected with unfrozen oocysts were utilized. Briefly, at the completion of the experiment, a section of gut was excised between duodenal bulb and rectum. Guts were homogenized with Tissue Master 125 homogenizer (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA, USA). Homogenized gut slurry was then processed as described above for fecal slurry with the exception of the filtration step using a cell strainer."

Next, 20 \u03bcL of 60% DMSO was added to dehydrated oocysts to achieve the concentration of 0.8 M trehalose/30% DMSO and was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Lastly, 20 \u03bcL of 90% DMSO was added to achieve final concentration of 0.5 M trehalose/50% DMSO. Following the second addition of DMSO, oocysts were loaded into polycarbonate cassettes (Grace Biolabs #RD500011; 52 mm\u00d740 mm) in the following manner: 60 \u03bcL of oocysts in CPA cocktail was loaded onto the cassette port and was aspirated into the cassette via negative pressure created by removing the air from the opposite port with 1 mL pipette tip fixed with punched PDMS gasket (Drummond Scientific). While the study described herein utilized 60 \u03bcL inocula containing 2,000,000 oocysts at a time, a single cassette can hold more than three times this volume. Loaded cassettes were then rapidly submerged in liquid nitrogen such that exposure to 50% DMSO did not exceed 1 min. Although the sample reaches cryogenic temperatures nearly instantaneously, oocysts were maintained in liquid nitrogen for 10 min prior to thawing. Thawing was achieved by quickly transferring the cassette from liquid nitrogen to a 40\u00b0 C. water bath for 20 s. It is critical that the cassette be rapidly transferred into liquid nitrogen, as well as be rapidly transferred from liquid nitrogen to 40\u00b0 C. for thawing, in order to avoid lethal ice crystallization. Contents of the cassette were expelled using hydraulic pressure applied by flushing PBS through the cassette port sealed with PDMS gasket attached to the 1 mL pipette tip. The contents expelled through the opposite port were collected with pipette and transferred to 1.5 mL tube to incubate in excess PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatant was then removed from samples by centrifugation (18,000\u00d7g, 2 min) and 100 \u03bcL of PBS was used to resuspend the pellet.

                                "To enable cryopreservation of increased sample volumes, a range of commercially available specimen containers that allow >200 \u03bcL were initially tested including cryovials and insemination straws for compatibility with the CPA loading protocol (Jaskiewicz et al., Cryopreservation of infectious Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Nat. Commun. 9, 2883 (2018)), with modifications (FIG. 5A). Specifically, as the thermal mass of the sample is increased in these larger specimen containers, the CPA concentration must also be increased to facilitate vitrification. This was accomplished by increasing the concentration of DMSO from 30 to 40%. The CPA solution was further supplemented with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), an extracellular CPA that reduces ice crystallization during thawing. When this CPA solution of DMSO and PVP was loaded into the specimen containers and submerged in liquid nitrogen, visual examination indicated a vitreous state was achieved. Although oocyst viability assessed by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion ranged between 25-35% (35.5\u00b13.4% for cryovial and 25.3\u00b17.1% for insemination straw) after thawing, oocysts failed to infect IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (FIGS. 5A-5B). This failure is likely due to damage induced by the formation of lethal intracellular ice crystals as a consequence of insufficient CPA concentration within the oocyst. Accordingly, as the cooling rate is reduced to \u02dc 103\u00b0 C./min, a higher concentration of CPA is required to prevent ice crystal formation inside of the oocysts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that commercially available containers including cryovials and insemination straws failed to cryopreserve viable and infectious C. parvum oocysts.",
                                "**Example 2: Development of High Aspect Ratio Specimen Containers to Enable Vitrification of Bulk Volumes**",
                                "High aspect ratio specimen containers were developed that maintain high cooling rates while simultaneously increasing sample volume. Initially, a commercially available borosilicate glass rectangular capillary that holds a volume of up to 40 \u03bcL was used, but it was very fragile and shattered easily (FIG. 6A). Next, a polycarbonate vitrification cassette based on a high aspect ratio model was designed (FIGS. 1A-1B, FIG. 6B, FIGS. 7A-7B). This cassette increases the sample volume to approximately 200 \u03bcL with minimal reduction of the cooling rate, estimated at 104\u00b0 C./min when plunged into liquid nitrogen, based on extrapolation from the observation of partial vitrification of a 25% v/v DMSO/water solution (He et al., Vitrification by ultra-fast cooling at a low concentration of cryoprotectants in a quartz micro-capillary: a study using murine embryonic stem cells. Cryobiology 56, 223-232 (2008); Hopkins et al., Effect of common cryoprotectants on critical warming rates and ice formation in aqueous solutions. Cryobiology 65, 169-178 (2012)). Given that a minimum of 30% DMSO was necessary to form extracellular glass in the vitrification cassettes, 50% DMSO was selected to maximize glass formation within the oocyst since the intracellular concentration of CPA is likely much lower than that present in the extracellular solution (FIG. 5C).",
                                "**Example 3: Hypochlorite Treatment Improves CPA Uptake**",
                                "Given the impermeable nature of the oocyst wall, an approach to increase CPA uptake is through improved permeabilization. Previously, treatment with hypochlorite was found to enable partial uptake of CPAs (Jaskiewicz et al., Cryopreservation of infectious Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Nat. Commun. 9, 2883 (2018)). Trehalose was then added to induce osmotic dehydration of oocysts, thereby increasing the overall concentration of CPAs within the oocyst and reducing the risk of formation of intracellular ice crystals. Here, this effect was enhanced by applying harsher bleaching conditions and increasing the osmotic trehalose gradient. Oocysts permeabilized by bleach and dehydrated in trehalose, both in increasing concentrations, were subsequently exposed to varying concentrations of DMSO (30% and 50%) over a 15 min period and evaluated for viability as an indirect measure of CPA uptake. FIG. 2A-2B illustrate the fitness of oocysts based on their viability and infectivity in vitro following CPA removal and recovery in PBS. Harsher bleaching conditions were found to increase permeability of oocysts to DMSO, both at 30% and 50% concentration, as evidenced indirectly by an observed increase in mortality rates. Oocysts incubated with 50% DMSO maintained acceptable viability and in vitro infectivity during 5 min of incubation (for 20% bleach condition: 59.4\u00b12.3% viability, 38.7\u00b117.0% in vitro infectivity). However, after 15 min or longer, DMSO at this concentration was found to be highly toxic (for 20% bleach condition: 17.5\u00b15.0% viability and 6.4\u00b11.9% infectivity). Oocysts exposed to the cocktail of 0.8 M trehalose/50% DMSO for 5 min and then subsequently cooled using both types of high aspect ratio specimen containers (i.e., rectangular capillary or cassette), were not infectious to IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (FIG. 6C).",
                                "These results demonstrate that 50% DMSO, although important for vitrification in these specimen containers, accumulates significant pre-freeze and post-thaw cytotoxicity, rendering oocysts non-infectious.",
                                "**Example 4: Two-Step CPA Loading Increased Pre-Freeze Viability and Infectivity**",
                                "To ensure glass formation in the vitrification cassettes, the intracellular concentration of DMSO was increased while minimizing cytotoxicity. This was accomplished by adding DMSO in a step-wise manner rather than all at once, such that a final extracellular concentration of 50% is achieved with reduced toxicity. In this approach, oocysts were first incubated in 30% DMSO for 5 min, and then 50% DMSO for one additional minute. This significantly increased pre-freeze viability and infectivity in vitro in comparison to the one-step DMSO addition at the same overall concentration (FIG. 2C). Based on low oocyst permeability, in the two-step protocol, the additional DMSO (50% v/v) is unlikely to accumulate substantially inside the oocyst as the duration of exposure is limited to 1 min. However, it was previously observed that oocysts substantially dehydrate in response to the hyperosmotic extracellular gradient created by extracellular DMSO (Jaskiewicz et al., Cryopreservation of infectious Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Nat. Commun. 9, 2883 (2018)). Thus, the initial low concentration of DMSO within the oocyst can increase as a result of water loss caused by the osmotic gradient applied during the second CPA loading step. Given this minimal toxicity, the two-step DMSO loading protocol was examined for the cryopreservation of oocysts using the vitrification cassettes.",

                                "Oocyst age is important for cryopreservation outcome (Jaskiewicz et al., Cryopreservation of infectious Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Nat. Commun. 9, 2883 (2018)), and therefore methods and cassettes described herein were tested on a single batch of oocysts at different ages: 1, 6 and 12 weeks. FIG. 3A shows the workflow used in these vitrification experiments. First, oocysts were permeabilized by treatment with 20% bleach for 1 min and then suspended in 1.6 M trehalose for 10 min to promote dehydration. Next, a final concentration of 50% DMSO/0.5 M trehalose was achieved using the stepwise CPA loading protocol described above. The sample was then loaded into a vitrification cassette and rapidly submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 min to ensure the specimen was fully vitrified. While 10 min under liquid nitrogen may be brief, this is sufficient time for the specimen to equilibrate at \u2212196\u00b0 C. At this temperature, enzymatic activity essentially stops, and therefore the quality of the specimen at 10 min is reflective of the quality expected under much longer storage durations. The sample was later thawed by brief submersion in a 40\u00b0 C. water bath. FIG. 3B shows the toxicity associated with CPA exposure for oocysts of different ages, as compared to the post-thaw toxicity caused cumulatively by CPA exposure and cryopreservation. Cryopreservation yielded 70-80% viable oocysts based on PI exclusion. While CPA toxicity alone reduced viability to \u02dc92% regardless of oocyst age, the oldest oocysts exhibited significantly increased mortality after thawing (78.9\u00b12.5%, 78.8\u00b14.2% and 71.7\u00b13.1% at 1-, 6- and 12-weeks, respectively). As exclusion of PI alone is found to be an inaccurate marker of viability (VandeBurgt et al., Comparison of in vitro viability methods for Cryptosporidium oocysts. Exp. Parasitol. 187, 30-36 (2018); and Black et al., Comparison of assays for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts viability after chemical disinfection. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 135, 187-189 (1996)), oocyst viability testing was coupled with the in vitro infectivity assay. Cryopreserved oocysts were found to invade and establish intracellular stages inside MDBK cells, with the exception of 12-week-old oocysts (FIG. 3C), which failed to invade. These results are consistent with previous observations in which oocysts cryopreserved at an older age exhibit reduced infectivity in animals (Jaskiewicz et al., Cryopreservation of infectious Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Nat. Commun. 9, 2883 (2018)).",

FIGS. 4A-4C show that oocysts of different ages (2, 6 and 12 weeks) cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for 10 min using the vitrification cassettes were infectious to mice. Specifically, mice inoculated with cryopreserved oocysts developed a patent infection at 4 days post infection (DPI), a day later than mice inoculated with unfrozen control oocysts, as evidenced by onset of fecal oocyst shedding. Contrary to our in vitro findings, no reduction in oocyst infectivity in vivo as a function of oocyst age was observed, as inferred from the onset of oocyst shedding on the same day. This data demonstrates that oocysts aged up to 12 weeks can be successfully cryopreserved using vitrification cassettes. It is estimated that \u02dc 107 oocysts can be obtained from one mouse infected with cryopreserved oocysts by direct purification from intestines collected post mortem. Additionally, collection of feces throughout the course of infection can further maximize the total output of oocysts. Oocysts cryopreserved in commercially available containers and oocysts cryopreserved in vitrification cassettes using one-step CPA loading were not infectious in animals after thawing.",
