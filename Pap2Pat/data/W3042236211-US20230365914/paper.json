    "abstract": "Infection with protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea in the developing world. Research on this parasite has been impeded by many technical limitations, including the lack of cryopreservation methods. While cryopreservation of Cryptosporidium oocysts by vitrification was recently achieved, the method is restricted to small sample volumes, thereby limiting widespread implementation of this procedure. Here, a second-generation method is described for cryopreservation of C. parvum oocysts by vitrification using custom high aspect ratio specimen containers, which enable a 100-fold increase in sample volume compared to previous methods. Oocysts cryopreserved using the described protocol exhibit high viability, maintain in vitro infectivity, and are infectious to interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) knockout mice. Importantly, the course of the infection is comparable to that observed in mice infected with unfrozen oocysts. Vitrification of C. parvum oocysts in larger volumes will expedite progress of research by enabling the sharing of isolates among different laboratories and the standardization of clinical trials.",

                "Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and infant death in low- and middle-income countries. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study identified infection with Cryptosporidium parasites as the second most common cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in infants in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia1. In this setting, cryptosporidiosis is strongly associated with death of infants and toddlers1,2. In fact, acute cryptosporidiosis caused >\u200948,000 deaths among children below the age of five in 2016 alone, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study3. Long-term consequences of early childhood cryptosporidiosis are related to malabsorption and undernutrition and include cognitive impairment and stunted growth4,5. It is estimated that burden from cryptosporidiosis, adjusted for undernutrition, accounted for more than 12 million disability-adjusted life-years in 20166. Additionally, cryptosporidiosis is also a key opportunistic infection among immunocompromised individuals, responsible for life-threatening persistent diarrhea7. In industrialized countries, prevalence of cryptosporidiosis is on the rise with a 13% increase in the number of outbreaks per year in the USA8. Current anti-parasitic drugs are ineffective and no vaccine is available to control the disease. These trends highlight the need to develop vaccines, better therapeutics and diagnostic tools for cryptosporidiosis. Until recently, a major technical limitation to research on cryptosporidiosis was the lack of methods for cryopreserving the parasite. In the absence of such methods, laboratory strains of Cryptosporidium are continuously propagated in laboratory animals (calves, pigs and rodents) every 6\u20138\u00a0weeks. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and has for years limited the sharing of well-characterized isolates among laboratories. This further precludes execution of clinical trials with standardized parasite preparations and hinders the development and evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines.",
                "Scientists have attempted to cryopreserve infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts for decades without much success9\u201314. These poor outcomes may be due in part to insufficient loading of cryoprotective agents (CPAs, e.g. dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, etc.). Specifically, the complex tetralaminar oocyst wall shielding sporozoites, the fragile invasive stage of the parasite, also prevents effective CPA loading15. Recently, our group reported a method to permeabilize the oocyst wall using hypochlorite, which enabled uptake of CPAs without compromising oocyst viability16. This treatment led to the development of a protocol for cryopreservation of infectious C. parvum oocysts by vitrification, an ice-free method of cryopreservation16. While conventional slow-cooling approaches to cryopreservation were attempted with CPA-loaded oocysts, thawed parasites were not infectious to mice, which is consistent with insufficient CPA uptake. In contrast, oocysts that were cryopreserved by apparent vitrification using the ultra-rapid cooling method yielded motile sporozoites of normal morphology, and they were infectious to interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) knockout mice.",
                "Vitrification, unlike slow-cooling, utilizes high concentrations of CPAs (~\u20094\u20138\u00a0M) combined with rapid cooling rates to achieve formation of an amorphous glassy state that is devoid of ice crystals. Given the toxicity of CPAs, the vitrification field has moved toward the development of containers that enable extremely rapid cooling rates, where the geometry of the specimen container can be manipulated to reduce the thermal mass of the sample, thereby enabling more rapid cooling rates. As the CPA concentration necessary to vitrify is inversely related to the cooling rate, these containers enable vitrification with significantly lower CPA concentrations17\u201322. Our group, in particular, utilized this approach for the vitrification of Cryptosporidium oocysts, where silica microcapillaries with an internal diameter of 200\u00a0\u00b5m were used to achieve a cooling rate of ~\u2009250,000\u00a0\u00b0C/min16. However, the dimensions of the microcapillary limit the sample volume to 2\u00a0\u00b5L and permit cryostorage of only 105 oocysts per device. While this cryopreservation protocol addresses a major bottleneck in the study of Cryptosporidium, and serves as proof of concept that oocysts are amenable to vitrification, the volume restriction and cumbersome methodology limit its practicality for routine laboratory use. Ideally, an oocyst cryopreservation method should enable storage of multiple inocula originating from a single sample in order to ensure uniformity for testing of vaccine and therapeutic candidates in pre-clinical and clinical trials.",
                "Here, we report a cryopreservation protocol that enables increased sample volume through the design and manufacture of novel high aspect ratio specimen containers referred to as \u2018vitrification cassettes\u2019. This strategy increases the volume of a single cryopreserved sample by 100-fold up to ca. 200\u00a0\u00b5L compared to the previously reported microcapillaries. This volume is sufficient to produce multiple inocula from a single cryopreserved sample (e.g. 4 doses for pigs or >\u200920 human doses for clinical trials), thus overcoming a major bottleneck in the development and testing of therapeutics for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis."

                        "To enable cryopreservation of increased sample volumes, a range of commercially available specimen containers that allow \u2265\u2009200\u00a0\u00b5L were initially tested including cryovials and insemination straws for compatibility with the previously developed CPA loading protocol16, with modifications (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1). Specifically, as the thermal mass of the sample is increased in these larger specimen containers, the CPA concentration must also be increased to facilitate vitrification. This was accomplished by increasing the concentration of DMSO from 30 to 40%. The CPA solution was further supplemented with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), an extracellular CPA demonstrated to reduce ice crystallization during thawing. When this CPA solution of DMSO and PVP was loaded into the specimen containers and submerged in liquid nitrogen, visual examination indicated a vitreous state was achieved. Although oocyst viability assessed by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion ranged between 25\u201335% (35.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4% for cryovial and 25.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1% for insemination straw) after thawing, oocysts failed to infect IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (Supplementary Figs. S1b,c). This failure is likely due to damage induced by the formation of lethal intracellular ice crystals as a consequence of insufficient CPA concentration within the oocyst. Specifically, as the cooling rate is reduced to ~\u2009103\u00a0\u00b0C/min23, a higher concentration of CPA is required to prevent ice crystal formation inside of the oocysts. Our next efforts therefore focused on both increasing the intracellular CPA concentration within oocysts and increasing cooling rates while maintaining a storage volume of \u2265\u2009200\u00a0\u00b5L."

                        "The need to maintain high cooling rates while simultaneously increasing sample volume led us to consider high aspect ratio specimen containers. We initially adopted a commercially available borosilicate glass rectangular capillary that holds a volume of up to 40 \u00b5L, but it was very fragile and shattered easily (Supplementary Fig. S2a). Next, a polycarbonate vitrification cassette based on a high aspect ratio model was designed (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Fig. S2b and S3). This cassette increases the sample volume to approximately 200\u00a0\u00b5L with minimal reduction of the cooling rate, estimated at 104\u00a0\u00b0C/min when plunged into liquid nitrogen, based on extrapolation from the observation of partial vitrification of a 25% v/v DMSO/water solution24,25. Given that a minimum of 30% DMSO is necessary to form extracellular glass in vitrification cassettes, we selected 50% DMSO to maximize glass formation within the oocyst since the intracellular concentration of CPA is likely much lower than that present in the extracellular solution (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Video S1). Strategies to increase the concentration of intracellular CPA, such that conditions for vitrification are created inside of the oocysts, were next optimized.Figure 1Design of high aspect ratio vitrification cassette. (a) The vitrification cassette consists of two sheets of polycarbonate laminates (thickness 178\u00a0\u00b5m) bonded by a sheet of pressure sensitive adhesive (thickness 120\u00a0\u00b5m) which is cut out to form the chamber. Outer dimensions are 52\u00a0mm by 40\u00a0mm, with internal volume of\u2009~\u2009200\u00a0\u00b5L. (b) Solutions are loaded into the cassette via pipette tip affixed to a PDMS punch (4\u00a0mm outer and 1\u00a0mm inner dimeter), which seals the cassette port and creates a vacuum. (c) Formation of vitreous or crystallized state is determined by visual inspection. Images reflect contents of cassettes at \u00d7\u200920 magnification immediately upon removal from liquid nitrogen. Pure water appears opaque indicating ice formation. A solution of 25% DMSO appears to vitrify, though ice formation occurs during transfer from liquid nitrogen to the microscope stage appearing as opaque blotches in the image. 50% DMSO appears to vitrify, though cracks form during the transfer from liquid nitrogen to the microscope stage.

                        "Given the impermeable nature of the oocyst wall, an approach to increase CPA uptake is through improved permeabilization. Previously, treatment with hypochlorite was found to enable partial uptake of CPAs16. Trehalose was then added to induce osmotic dehydration of oocysts, thereby increasing the overall concentration of CPAs within the oocyst and reducing the risk of formation of intracellular ice crystals. Here, we attempted to increase this effect by applying harsher bleaching conditions and increasing the osmotic trehalose gradient. Oocysts permeabilized by bleach and dehydrated in trehalose, both in increasing concentrations, were subsequently exposed to varying concentrations of DMSO (30% and 50%) over a 15\u00a0min period and evaluated for viability as an indirect measure of CPA uptake. Figure\u00a02a,b illustrate the fitness of oocysts based on their viability and infectivity in vitro following CPA removal and recovery in PBS. Harsher bleaching conditions were found to increase permeability of oocysts to DMSO, both at 30% and 50% concentration, as evidenced indirectly by an observed increase in mortality rates. Oocysts incubated with 50% DMSO maintained acceptable viability and in vitro infectivity during 5\u00a0min of incubation (for 20% bleach condition: 59.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3% viability, 38.7\u2009\u00b1\u200917.0% in vitro infectivity). However, after 15\u00a0min or longer, DMSO at this concentration was found to be highly toxic (for 20% bleach condition: 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0% viability and 6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9% infectivity). Oocysts exposed to the cocktail of 0.8\u00a0M trehalose/50% DMSO for 5\u00a0min and then subsequently cooled using both types of high aspect ratio specimen containers (i.e. rectangular capillary or cassette), were not infectious to IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. S2c, Supplementary Table S1). This indicates that 50% DMSO, although necessary for vitrification in these specimen containers, accumulates significant pre-freeze and post-thaw cytotoxicity, rendering oocysts non-infectious.Figure 2Approaches to increase intracellular concentration of CPA. Increasing concentrations of bleach, trehalose and DMSO were applied to maximize intracellular permeation of CPA among C. parvum oocysts. (a) Viability of oocysts permeabilized with either 5% or 20% bleach, followed by incubation with a CPA cocktail containing varying concentrations of trehalose and DMSO over a duration of 5\u201315\u00a0min. Viability was measured by PI exclusion after removal of CPA (n\u2009=\u20093). Differences in viability in response to bleaching and trehalose/DMSO treatment were measured using two-way ANOVA (***p\u2009<\u20090.0001; **p\u2009=\u20090.002). (b) Infectivity was measured as percent of intracellular parasitic stages established in MDBK cells in comparison to control oocysts incubated with PBS in lieu of DMSO (n\u2009=\u20094). Differences in infectivity in response to DMSO concentration were measured for both permeabilization/ dehydration protocols using two-way ANOVA (***p\u2009<\u20090.0001). (c) Reduced CPA toxicity was accomplished through the introduction of a two-step CPA loading protocol. Toxicity due to CPA alone (pre-freeze) was measured in terms of viability and in vitro infectivity following treatment with 50% DMSO in either one- or two-step additions. Oocysts were bleached (20%), dehydrated (1.6\u00a0M trehalose, 10\u00a0min) and then incubated with 50% DMSO for 5\u00a0min or for 1\u00a0min following 5\u00a0min 30% DMSO incubation. Viability is reported as percent of PI\u2212 oocysts and infectivity as percent of intracellular parasitic stages established in MDBK cells in comparison to control oocysts incubated with PBS in lieu of DMSO (n\u2009=\u20093).

                        "To ensure glass formation in the vitrification cassettes, we next focused on increasing the intracellular concentration of DMSO while minimizing cytotoxicity. This was accomplished by adding DMSO in a step-wise manner rather than all at once, such that a final extracellular concentration of 50% is achieved with reduced toxicity. In this approach, oocysts were first incubated in 30% DMSO for 5\u00a0min, and then 50% DMSO for one additional minute. This significantly increased pre-freeze viability and infectivity in vitro in comparison to the one-step DMSO addition at the same overall concentration (Fig.\u00a02c). Based on low oocyst permeability, we expect that for the two-step protocol, the additional DMSO (50% v/v) is unlikely to accumulate substantially inside the oocyst as the duration of exposure is limited to 1\u00a0min. However, based on previous observations16, oocysts are expected to substantially dehydrate in response to the hyperosmotic extracellular gradient created by extracellular DMSO. Thus, the initial low concentration of DMSO within the oocyst is expected to increase as a result of water loss caused by the osmotic gradient applied during the second CPA loading step. Given the minimal toxicity, the two-step DMSO loading protocol was prioritized for the cryopreservation of oocysts using the vitrification cassettes."

                        "Since previous work revealed the importance of oocyst age on cryopreservation outcome16, the present protocol was tested on a single batch of oocysts at different ages: 1, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks. Figure\u00a03a shows the workflow used in these vitrification experiments (for detailed protocol, see Supplementary Protocol S1). First, oocysts were permeabilized by treatment with 20% bleach for 1\u00a0min and then suspended in 1.6\u00a0M trehalose for 10\u00a0min to promote dehydration. Next, a final concentration of 50% DMSO/0.5\u00a0M trehalose was achieved using the stepwise CPA loading protocol described above. The sample was then loaded into a vitrification cassette and rapidly submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10\u00a0min to ensure the specimen was fully vitrified. While 10\u00a0min under liquid nitrogen may be brief, this is sufficient time for the specimen to equilibrate at \u2212\u2009196\u00a0\u00b0C. At this temperature, enzymatic activity essentially stops, and therefore the quality of the specimen at 10\u00a0min is reflective of the quality expected under much longer storage durations. The sample was later thawed by brief submersion in a 40\u00a0\u00b0C water bath. Figure\u00a03b shows the toxicity associated with CPA exposure for oocysts of different ages, as compared to the post-thaw toxicity caused cumulatively by CPA exposure and cryopreservation. Cryopreservation yielded 70\u201380% viable oocysts based on PI exclusion. While CPA toxicity alone reduced viability to ~\u200992% regardless of oocyst age, the oldest oocysts exhibited significantly increased mortality after thawing (78.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5%, 78.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2% and 71.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1% at 1-, 6- and 12-weeks, respectively). As exclusion of PI alone is found to be an inaccurate marker of viability26,27, oocyst viability testing was coupled with the in vitro infectivity assay. Cryopreserved oocysts were found to invade and establish intracellular stages inside MDBK cells, with the exception of 12-week-old oocysts (Fig.\u00a03c, Supplementary Fig. S4), which failed to invade. This compares favorably to the previously observed trend, where oocysts cryopreserved at an older age exhibit reduced infectivity in animals16.Figure 3Oocysts frozen in vitrification cassettes are viable and exhibit in vitro infectivity. (a) C. parvum oocysts at 1, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks of age were bleached (20%), dehydrated in 1.6\u00a0M trehalose and then incubated with 30% DMSO for 5\u00a0min and additional 50% DMSO for 1\u00a0min. Oocysts were then immediately loaded into cassettes and submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10\u00a0min to achieve vitrification. Oocysts were thawed by quickly transferring the cassette from liquid nitrogen to a 40\u00a0\u00b0C water bath. Viability and infectivity were quantified after CPA removal. (b) Oocyst viability was determined by PI exclusion, both pre-freeze and after thawing of oocysts at different ages. Horizontal lines indicate mean and error bars standard deviation (n\u2009=\u20094). There were no differences in pre-freeze and thawed (post-freeze) viability between oocysts of different ages (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, pre-freeze: p\u2009=\u20090.64; post-freeze: p\u2009=\u20090.06), except a slight decrease in viability after thawing for 12- in comparison to 1-week-old oocysts (Mann\u2013Whitney test, *p\u2009=\u20090.03). (c) In vitro oocyst infectivity was determined using the MDBK infection assay. Thawed oocysts were co-incubated with MDBK cells for 24\u00a0h at MOI 1:1.

Figure\u00a04a\u2013c show that oocysts of different ages (2, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks) cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for 10\u00a0min using the vitrification cassettes were infectious to mice. Specifically, mice inoculated with cryopreserved oocysts developed a patent infection at 4\u00a0days post infection (DPI), a day later than mice inoculated with unfrozen control oocysts, as evidenced by onset of fecal oocyst shedding. Contrary to our in vitro findings, no reduction in oocyst infectivity in vivo as a function of oocyst age was observed, as inferred from the onset of oocyst shedding on the same day. This data demonstrates that oocysts aged up to 12\u00a0weeks can be successfully cryopreserved using vitrification cassettes. We estimate that ~\u2009107 oocysts can be obtained from one mouse infected with cryopreserved oocysts by direct purification from intestines collected post mortem. Additionally, collection of feces throughout the course of infection can further maximize the total output of oocysts.Figure 4Cryopreserved C. parvum oocysts are infectious to IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice. Bleached (20%) and dehydrated (1.6\u00a0M trehalose, 10\u00a0min) C. parvum oocysts were frozen at the age of 2, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks, using vitrification cassettes after application of the two-step DMSO loading protocol, such that oocysts were first incubated in 30% DMSO for 5\u00a0min, followed by 1\u00a0min incubation in 50% DMSO. Oocysts were submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10\u00a0min, which is sufficient to ensure complete equilibration under cryogenic conditions. IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (n\u2009=\u20093) were then inoculated orally with 30,000 PI\u2212 thawed or unfrozen control oocysts. Intensity of fecal shedding was quantified daily by microscopic enumeration of oocysts in 30 fields of acid-fast stained fecal smears under \u00d7\u20091,000 magnification. Positive (unfrozen) and negative (heat-inactivated) oocyst controls were included as age-matched controls. To determine whether oocyst age affects survival during cryopreservation, 2- (a), 6- (b) and 12-week-old (c) oocysts were studied. Values indicate means of log transformed oocysts count and error bars indicate standard deviation, except for 4\u00a0dpi for 12-week old oocysts, which indicates a pooled sample. Viability of cryopreserved oocysts was determined by PI exclusion prior to inoculation and was as follows: 75.9%, 74.1% and 76% for 2-, 6- and 12-week-old oocysts, respectively. Untransformed data can be found in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5a\u2013c."

                "Here, cryopreservation of C. parvum oocysts was achieved by incubation of permeabilized oocysts in an optimized CPA cocktail containing DMSO and trehalose combined with application of ultra-fast cooling rates, facilitated by vitrification cassettes. The geometry of the cassette was designed to maintain a rapid cooling rate despite the increased sample volume of 200\u00a0\u00b5L. Such increased volume comes inherently with a reduction in cooling rate in comparison to that of the previously reported microcapillary used for vitrification of oocysts16. We balanced the conditions of glass formation at this lower cooling rate by increasing the concentration of trehalose and DMSO in the extracellular solution and the intracellular compartment under conditions of increased oocyst permeability. Interestingly, Cryptosporidium parasites possess a synthetic pathway for trehalose28. We suspect that the native presence of this known glass-forming disaccharide29,30 may further benefit the cryopreservation outcome by promotion of intracellular glass formation upon dehydration of the oocyst.",
                "Notably, a 200\u00a0\u00b5L storage volume allowed by the vitrification cassette enables storage of ca. ~\u20096,000,000 oocysts in a single specimen container. For comparison, cryopreservation of the same number of oocysts using our previously described method would require over 60 individually loaded microcapillaries, therefore entailing significantly more time and labor. Overall, the vitrification cassettes enable cryopreservation of oocysts with reduced labor and technical challenges, which is likely to facilitate broader dissemination of the protocol. This is particularly useful as the field invests resources into genome sequencing31,32 and genetic modification33,34, where cryopreservation of well characterized strains becomes an urgent priority.",
                "The ability to cryopreserve large batches of oocysts may be transformative to the field by enabling broader access to parasites for research. Drug testing efforts and vaccine development would also benefit considerably from the availability of cryopreserved Cryptosporidium reference lines. Ideally, inocula for drug or vaccine trials should be of the same optimized batch to ensure reproducibility. Cryopreservation in one container eliminates variability expected with the use of multiple microcapillaries as each container undergoes separate cooling and rewarming events. Importantly, one vitrification cassette can hold a sufficient number of oocysts to produce multiple inocula from a single cryopreserved sample (e.g. ~\u20094 doses for piglets or >\u200920 doses for human subjects), whereas ~\u200920 microcapillaries would be required to produce a single inoculum for a piglet. Additionally, studies involving human subjects should be of the same standardized and validated batch of oocysts. Our cryopreservation protocol can reduce the effort of standardization and validation of specimens in vitro and in vivo following each propagation prior to evaluation at different testing sites. The ability to cryopreserve large numbers of oocysts from a single batch and thaw as needed can ascertain uniformity of the challenge dose and thus reduce considerably batch-to-batch variation. We recognize a key limitation of this study is the minimal number of strains validated. While the previously developed method of ultra-rapid vitrification has now been successfully applied to different isolates of C. parvum, C. hominis and C. tyzzeri, including transgenic strains, the method examined here must be evaluated further to ensure robustness of the protocol.",
                "Vitrification with reduced CPA concentrations and ultra-rapid cooling rates has been shown to be effective for the preservation of many cell types. However, this approach characteristically comes at the cost of sample volume. Here, we have described a novel high aspect ratio vitrification cassette that strikes the balance between the competing requirements for maximal surface area to volume ratio and sufficient specimen volumes for future clinical and research applications."

Starting from 5 DPI, which marks onset of fecal oocyst shedding, mice were kept in collection microisolators during the night for collection of fecal material and then rested in bedded microisolators during the day, both with access to food and water ad libitum. At termination of the experiment on 15 DPI, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation as required by the Tufts University IACUC guidelines. Oocysts were purified from mice feces by ether extraction and separated on a nycodenz gradient, as described elsewhere36 with minor modifications. Briefly, homogenized fecal slurry was filtered through a 100\u00a0\u00b5m cell strainer and treated with diethyl ether in water containing 0.5% Tween 80 at the ratio 2:3. Oocysts were isolated by ultracentrifugation (13,400\u00d7g, 60\u00a0min) on a 10%/25% nycodenz gradient. Harvested oocysts were then resuspended in PBS and stored in 4\u00a0\u00b0C.
