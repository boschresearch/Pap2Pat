The present invention further relates to tryptamine derivatives of general formula 1 which were synthesized by the formation of amide or ester with some known anti oxidant molecules such as gallic acid, 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid.

Present invention further relates to tryptamine derivatives of general formula 1 useful as antioxidant and antiapoptotic effect to prevent gastropathy/gastric mucosal injury induced by Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), stress and ethanol.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are most useful drugs in the world for the treatment of pain, rheumatic disorders, inflammation, and osteo-arthritis (Harth, M; et al. Br Med J, 1 (5479), 80-83, 1966).

NSAIDs have antipyretic activity and can be used for the treatment of fever. (Koeberle A; et al. Curr Med Chem 16 (32) 2009, 4274-96). So we can not avoid NSAIDs treatment but the major limitation associated with NSAIDs treatment is the development of serious gastropathy or gastric mucosal damage with profuse bleeding and dyspepsia. NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events are estimated to result in 103,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths per year in the United States (Green, G. A., Clin Cornerstone, 3 (5), 50-60, 2001). NSAIDs are also responsible for Nausea/Vomiting, Diarrhea (Simone Rossi, ed (2006). Australian medicines handbook 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd).

Reference may be made to journal “Maity, P; et al. J Biol Chem, 283 (21), 14391-14401, 2008”, wherein it is well established that the major cause of NSAID-induced gastropathy is the development of oxidative stress in gastric mucosa due to the excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

It has been documented that ROS induces gastropathy through the induction of both mitochondrial and death-receptor mediated pathway of gastric mucosal cell apoptosis (Maity, P; et al. J Pineal Res, 46 (3), 314-323, 2009). In fact, NSAIDs induce mitochondrial pathology, which is associated with increased generation of intra-mitochondrial ROS, such as O2.−, H2O2 and .OH leading to oxidative stress. O2.− is the most effective to damage mitochondrial aconitase, leading to the release of iron from its iron-sulfur cluster. The released iron, by interacting with intra-mitochondrial H2O2 forms .OH. Interestingly, intra-mitochondrial .OH generation is crucial for the development of mitochondrial pathology and activation of mitochondrial death pathway by indomethacin (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009). Chelation of free iron by desferrioxamin or prevention of the oxidative stress in gastric mucosa can protect gastric mucosal damage (Bandyopadhyay et al. Life Sci. 2002 Nov. 1; 71(24):2845-65). The release and involvement of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in gastric mucosa (Ogihara, Y; et al. Jpn J Pharmacol, 61 (2), 123-131, 1993) is also evident in NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury. Serotonin (5-hydroxy tryptamine) is a biogenic amine and well known neurotransmitter (Kushnir I H; et al. Fiziol Zh, 55 (3), 125-127, 2009).

It is important to mention that serotonin reduces gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) by vasoconstriction and thereby causing acute gastric injury (Wong, S. H; et al. Digestion, 45 (1), 52-60, 1990, Yoneda, M; et al. Am J Physiol, 269 (1 Pt 2), R1-6, 1995) through the generation of ROS by promoting ischemia (Khan, M; et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 323 (3), 813-821, 2007). Serotonin adversely affects the defense mechanisms of the gastric mucosa by reducing the secretory function of the mucosal cells and to weaken the epithelial and vascular integrity. Neutrophil activation appears to be responsible for the detrimental effects of 5-HT partly through the elevation in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (Ko, J; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 24 (6), 1007-1014, 1998).

It is worth mentioning that serotonin plays an important role in indomethacin, [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)], ethanol (Wong, S. H; et al. Digestion, 45 (1), 52-60, 1990) and stress-induced gastric ulcer (Debnath, S; et al. Indian J Exp Biol, 45 (8), 726-731, 2007). Serotonin can cause oxidative stress through the generation of ROS (Bianchi, P; et al. FASEB J, 19 (6), 641-643, 2005). Serotonin is released in response to inflammation (Yoneda, M; et al. Am J Physiol, 269 (1 Pt 2), R1-6, 1995) and the increase in mucosal XO activity by serotonin may induce free radical production and possibly modulate the ulcerogenic processes (Ko, J; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 24 (6), 1007-1014, 1998). Serotonin generates ROS by receptor-independent and receptor-dependent mechanisms (Bianchi, P; et al. FASEB J, 19 (6), 641-643, 2005). Gastric ulcer or gastropathy is a kind of inflammatory disorder of gastric mucosa (Mierzwa, G; et al. Med Wieku Rozwoj, 9 (4), 647-654, 2005).

Thus, it will be of great benefit to synthesize molecule, which will scavenge ROS or chelate free iron and at the same time will prevent the interaction of serotonin with its corresponding receptor to combat NSAID-induced gastropathy or related disorders. Gallic acid (GA), an iron chelator, is a gastroprotective compound and efficiently protects NSAIDs-induced gastric mucosal damage (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010). The mechanistic studies reveal that GA offers gastroprotective effect by preventing the NSAID-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells and it also prevents the NSAID-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010).

Present invention provides different tryptamine (serotonin like molecule) derivatives by formation of amide or ester linkage with GA and some other tryptamine derivatives by replacing GA with some other known antioxidant such as 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, 3-indole acetic acid. The major disadvantage of serotonin is its toxicity. On the other hand the limitation of GA is its poor bioavailability (Shahrzad, S; et al. J Nutr, 131 (4), 1207-1210, 2001). Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability studies indicate that GA is metabolized into 4-O-methylgallic acid very rapidly and the bioavailability in plasma is low. The 38% of the intake of GA were excreted through urine (Shahrzad, S; et al. J Nutr, 131 (4), 1207-1210, 2001, Manach, C; et al. Am J Clin Nutr, 81 (1 Suppl), 230S-242S, 2005). indole-3-acetic acid and 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid plays an important antioxidant activity by scavenging free radical (Cano, A; et al Anal Bioanal Chem (2003) 376: 33-37, Kylli, P; Anal Bioanal Chem (2003) 376: 33-37). It has been reported that the serotonin derivative (compound 2b of the present study) can be biosynthesized by the combination of serotonin and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (SHT) (Kiyoon Kang et al, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2009) 83:27-34). It was isolated from the seeds of Centaurea montana (Asteraceae), and it shows in vitro cytotoxic activity against the CaCo2 colon cancer cells (Mohammad Shoeb et al, Tetrahedron 62 (2006) 11172-11177).

There are some limitations of the existing gastro protective compounds such as proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole. etc), H2 receptor blockers (ranitidine, cimetidine etc). Although these existing molecules are effective at a very low dose against NSAID-induced gastropathy but it has some adverse effects like diarrhea (Mukherjee, S., J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 18 (5), 602-603, 2003), linear mucosal defects and friable mucosa associated with collagenous colitis, leydig cell tumors, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, myopathy including polymyositis, acute nephritis and anaphylactic reactions (Mukherjee, S., J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 18 (5), 602-603, 2003, Clark, D. W; et al. Fundam Appl Toxicol, 26 (2), 191-202, 1995). Proton pump inhibitors are reported to be associated with an increased risk of bacterial infection and related diseases (Dial, S; et al. JAMA, 292 (16), 1955-1960, 2004).

The synthesized derivatives of the present invention have several advantages. These derivatives can chelate free iron, prevent oxidative stress by scavenging ROS and simultaneously offer antiapoptotic effect in vitro. These derivatives have the ability to prevent the formation of iron-mediated .OH as well as scavenge ROS in vivo. These derivatives can prevent gastric mucosal oxidative stress and gastropathy by preventing ROS-mediated activation of apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells induced by NSAIDs.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

In the present invention, tryptamine derivatives SEGA (3a), TRGA (3b), MEGA (3c), GASA (4d), 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f, 2h, 2i, 5c, and 6c were synthesized by condensation of serotonin, tryptamine, 5-methoxytryptamine with some known antioxidant such as gallic acid, 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, indole-3-acetic acid etc. Among all these derivatives the compound SEGA (3a), prepared by combining serotonin and gallic acid, shows the greater anti-oxidant property in vitro than the other derivatives.

The primary amine group of serotonin is derivatized into various amide derivatives such as N-gallyl (SEGA) 3a, N-cinnamyl 2b and N-indole acetyl 2c respectively. These derivatives were synthesized by condensation of serotonin with benzylated gallic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and indol-3-acetic acid respectively in presence of 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC.HCl) and Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), followed by hydrogenolysis (for 3a) in presence of 10% Pd—C/H2 as outlined in the (FIG. 1). For the gallic acid derivatives with different amines, gallic acid was treated with benzyl chloride in presence of potassium carbonate and catalytic tetra n-butyl ammonium iodide to give benzyl 3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)benzoate (1a), which upon hydrolysis with ethanolic 20% KOH solution under reflux provided 3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)benzoic acid, (1b) (FIG. 1). To assess the importance of the free hydroxyl functional group of serotonin at 5-position of indole nucleus, further 5-deoxy derivative TRGA (3b) and 5-methoxy derivative 3c using tryptamine hydrochloride and 5-methoxy tryptamine respectively have synthesized. Condensation of these amines with 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, 4,5-tris(benzyloxy)benzoic acid (1b), using the same procedure as described before, furnished amide derivatives (FIG. 2) 2e, 2f, 2h, 2i, 3b, and 3c respectively in good yields. In order to understand the effect of gallic acid as substituent in serotonin-gallic acid conjugate (whether gallic acid is attached to primary amine group of serotonin as N-gallyl amide orelse it is attached to free hydroxyl functionality of serotoin as o-gally ester) and in addition to see the effect of free amine group in serotonin-gallic acid conjugate, further o-gallyl ester GASA (4d) (FIG. 3) have synthesized. For the preparation of o-gallyl ester (4d), the primary amine group was protected with Boc using di-tert-butyloxycarbonyl anhydride to give tert-butyl 2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethylcarbamate (4a) (Breitinger, H. G; et al. Biochemistry, 39 (18), 5500-5508, 2000). Condensation of Boc-Protected serotonin 4a with 3,4,5-tris(benzyloxy)benzoic acid (1b), yielded the ester 4b, which upon hydrogenolysis with 10% Pd—C/H2 followed by deprotection of the Boc group in presence of 96% formic acid provided the required compound, GASA (4d) (FIG. 3). To see the importance of free methoxy functionality of melatonin at 5-position of indole nucleus, 5-hydroxy derivative 5c have also synthesized, by treating melatonin with BBr3 at −78° C. in 45% yield as shown in (FIG. 3) (Srivastava, V; et al. Bioorg Med Chem, 15 (1), 518-525, 2007). To the end, dimeric serotonin derivative 6c was synthesized for structure-activity relationship study (SAR) starting from serotonin as shown in FIG. 4. Accordingly, Boc protected serotonin 4a was converted into the carboxylic acid derivative 6a, by treating with glutaric anhydride in presence of trimethyl amine and N,N dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) (Shi, W; et al. Org Lett, 9 (26), 5461-5464, 2007). Condensation of 6a with another serotonin molecule in presence of EDC afforded the compound 6b, which on subsequent treatment with 96% formic acid provided the required serotonin dimer 6c (FIG. 4).

All these derivatives play an important antioxidant activity in vitro by reducing Fe (III) in to Fe (II) in the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP assay) and also scavenging DPPH free radicals in DPPH assay. These experiments were performed in presence of some known anti oxidant available in the markets. SEGA (3a) shows the greater antioxidant activity than the known anti oxidant.

These derivatives protect the gastric mucosa from NSAIDs (indomethacin, diclofenac)-induced gastric mucosal damage in a dose dependent manner. These derivatives also protect gastric mucosa against stress and ethanol-induced injury

SEGA (3a) shows the gastro protective effect in NSAIDs (indomethacin, diclofenac)-induced gastropathy in dose dependent manner, it also prevent the ethanol, stress-induced gastropathy.

SEGA (3a) protects NSAIDs-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress by preventing NSAIDs-mediated mitochondrial protein carbonyl formation, peroxidation of mitochondrial protein, and depletion of total thiol content in mitochondria.

SEGA (3a) protects indomethacin-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosa in vivo as evident from the TUNEL assay and by preventing the indomethacin-induced caspase-3 activation. It also protects the apoptosis in in vitro cultured gastric mucosa by as manifested by the TUNEL assay. SEGA (3a) protects the mitochondrial path way of apoptosis by preventing the indomethacin-induced caspase-9 activation.

SEGA (3a) prevents NSAIDs-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, restores the NSAIDs-induced fall off mitochondrial membrane potential, checks the indomethacin-induced reduction in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and scavenges intra mitochondrial superoxide. It plays an important role as a mitochondrial iron chelator as well as intra mitochondrial ROS i.e. superoxide scavenger.

### Biological Effects

The antioxidant property of different tryptamine derivatives were assessed and compared with the known antioxidants for potency. A range of different synthesized compounds and known anti oxidants, quercetin, ascorbic acid and gallic acid were analyzed by the FRAP assay. The FRAP assay is based on the measurement of the ability of the substance to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, greater the reducing ability greater the anti oxidant property. Antioxidants reduce Fe3+-TPTZ in to blue colored Fe2+-TPTZ complex, which results in an increase in the absorbance at 595 nm giving a FRAP value. Higher FRAP value indicates that greater reducing (i.e. antioxidant property) ability of the compound. Absorbance changes at different time intervals (FIG. 6) as well as at different concentrations (FIG. 7) at time 6 min in the presence of different compounds at 595 nm were measured. FRAP values at 6 min and 65 min were calculated from different tryptamine derivatives and some known antioxidant (Table 1). Results clearly indicate that serotonin-gallic acid conjugate SEGA (3a) shows greater reducing ability (Fe3+ to Fe2±) compare to other tryptamine derivative as well as known antioxidant (gallic acid, quercetin, and ascorbic acid). Serotonin shows very little antioxidant property and the antioxidant property is not increased even after dimerisation thus indicating very insignificant native anti oxidant property of serotonin Anti oxidant property of these synthesized derivatives were further verified by the DPPH assay. DPPH assay based on the DPPH free radicals scavenging power of the antioxidant molecules. Higher the scavenging power higher will be the antioxidant property. The results indicate that among all the derivatives SEGA (3a) shows the higher scavenging power (FIG. 8) (Table 2 and table 3). This assay was performed in presence of some known antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, quercetin and gallic acid. The results indicate that SEGA (3a) shows almost equal antioxidant power to these known antioxidants (data not shown).

SEGA (3a) (dissolved in 0.05 N NaOH) dose dependently (ED50 6.9 mg kg−1) prevents indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage. In case of indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury, SEGA (3a) offers 94%, 82%, 62%, 45%, 28%, and 17% and in case of diclofenac induced ulcer it offers 82%, 72%, 57%, 42%, 25%, and 22% protection at the dose of 50, 20, 10, 5, 3, and 1 mg kg−1 respectively (FIG. 9). SEGA (3a) not only show the gastroprotective effect on NSAIDs-induced gastropathy it also protects the gastric mucosa in the ethanol, stress induced gastropathy (FIG. 10). To see the changes in the microscopic anatomy of the gastric mucosal tissue in control, indomethacin treated and SEGA (3a) pretreated indomethacin-treated sample we did the histological studies (FIG. 11). This further demonstrated that SEGA (3a) could protect gastric mucosa from the indomethacin induced increased gastric mucosal cell damage and cell shedding leading to the development of damage in the superficial mucosa. To see the effect of other tryptamine derivatives over the indomethacin-induced gastropathy, all the derivatives of tryptamine TRGA (3b), MEGA (3c), GASA (4d) (dissolved in 0.05 N NaOH) were administered intraperitoneally at ED50 dose of SEGA (3a) i.e. 6.9 mg kg−1. The results indicate that these derivatives have the lesser gastroprotective effect than the SEGA (3a) (Table. 4). To observe the effect of only serotonin on gastropathy we synthesized serotonin dimmer (6c), when this compound was injected all the rats were found dead within 20 mins. From this experiment it is clear that serotonin is a toxic molecule. To cross check this result we administered serotonin i.p. at the dose 50 mg kg−1, and 25 mg kg−1 and again all the rats were found to be dead. Thus we can conclude that serotonin is a toxic molecule on the other hand serotonin derived compound SEGA (3a) is a nontoxic molecule. Thus from this experiment we can conclude that by blocking the amine group of serotonin with gallic acid we detoxify the serotonin molecule. It also rescues the NSAIDs-induced already damaged gastric mucosa, i.e. it accelerates the healing process (FIG. 12).

Compound SEGA (3a) significantly protected NSAIDs (indomethcin, diclofenac)-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress; it protects oxidation of mitochondrial protein (protein carbonyl formation), depletion of mitochondrial thiol, and peroxidation of mitochondrial lipid. The results showed that increased formation of protein carbonyl, peroxidation of mitochondrial lipid and depletion of the mitochondrial thiol at the gastric mucosa, but pretreatment with the compound SEGA (3a) prevented NSAIDs (indomethcin, diclofenac)-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress (FIG. 13) Thus, from this experiment we can say that compound SEGA plays an important antioxidant role in vivo

SEGA (3a) prevents oxidative stress-induced gastric mucosal apoptosis during ulceration. Indomethacin induces gastric mucosal apoptosis through the generation of ROS and subsequent induction of oxidative stress. Therefore, to further explore the antioxidant gastroprotective effect of compound SEGA (3a), the activation of caspases (marker for apoptosis) by indomethacin were measured in presence or absence of compound SEGA (3a). The results indicate that compound SEGA (3a) prevents indomethacin-induced activation of caspase-3 (FIG. 14A) in dose dependent manner. Interestingly, compound SEGA (3a) also prevents the activation of caspase-9 during indomethacin treatment (FIG. 15). The activation of caspase-9 indicates the operation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis where the development of mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a vital role. Since compound SEGA (3a) is antioxidant in nature in vivo and prevents the activation of caspase-9 it indicates that the compound may prevent the mitochondrial oxidative stress to offer antiapoptotic effect. By performing TUNEL assay it can conclude that SEGA (3a) prevents the indomethcin-induced apoptosis in vivo (FIG. 14B) as well as in vitro cultured gastric mucosa (FIG. 16).

SEGA (3a) restores the indomethacin induced mitochondrial dysfunction as confirmed by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential, dehydrogenase activities, and reduces mitochondrial superoxides. NSAIDs (indomethacin, diclofenac) increases the mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by the ratio of fluorescence values at 590 nm (JC-1 aggregate) and 530 nm (JC-1 monomer) (FIG. 17), mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity as measured by MTT reduction assay (FIG. 17) and also increases the superoxides as measured by mitoSOX (FIG. 18) but pretreatment of SEGA (3a) restores all the NSAIDs-induced mitochondrial dysfuctions. SEGA (3a) also chelates the intramitochondrial iron in vitro cultured cell as measured Phen Green SK. (FIG. 19).

**Determination of In Vitro Antioxidant Property by Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) Assay**

The assay was performed in a 96-well microplate. FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing of 10 ml acetate buffer (200 mM, pH-3.6), 1 ml of 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution (10 mM in 40 mM HCl) and 1 ml of ferric chloride solution (20 mM) in distilled water. For 1 h the mixture was kept in a water bath at 37° C. In 96-well microplates, 25 μL of the compounds under investigation dissolved (in methanol, some compound dissolved in water) at different concentrations in the range 1-25 μM was placed in triplicate and freshly prepared FRAP solution (175 μL) was added to this sample. A micro plate reader monitored the absorbance at 595 nm at different time intervals for up to 150 min. The absorbance of a mixture 175 μL TRAP sol and 25 μL methanol or water was taken which was subtracted from the absorbance of the samples at each time interval to calculate the absorbance change (ΔA). The FRAP value at time interval t (FRAP valuet) was calculated according to the formula:

FRAP valuet(M)=(ΔatFl/ΔatFe2+)×10−5

Where ΔatFl is the absorbance change after the time interval t (6 and 65 min) relative to the tested flavonoid at the concentration of 10 μM and ΔatFe2+ is the absorbance change at the same time interval relative to ferrous sulfate at the same concentration (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267, 2010, Firuzi, 0; et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1721:174-184; 2005).

**Example 16**

**Free Radical Scavenging Activity In Vitro (DPPH Assay)**

2,2-Diphenyl-1-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) is a stable free radical that can accept hydrogen radical or an electron and become a stable diamagnetic molecule. The antioxidants can scavenge the DPPH by donating hydrogen as visualized by discoloration of the DPPH radical from purple to yellow (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010, Ben Farhat, M.; et al. J. Agric. Food Chem. 57:10349-10356; 2009, Han, J; et al. Wei Sheng Yan Jiu 38:596-598; 2009). The assay system contained 1 mL of compounds under investigation dissolved (in methanol, some compound dissolved in water) at different concentrations in the range 10-100 μM solution and 4 ml of DPPH (0.15 mM) in methanol (80% in water v/v) and mixed well. It was allowed to stand for 30 min at 27° C. away from light. Ascorbic acid at the same concentration was taken as positive control. The absorbance of the solution was measured spectrophotometrically at 517 nm and from the decrease of absorption; the antioxidant activity of different tryptamine derivatives were determined.

**Example 17**

**Animals and Gastric Damage Induced by Indomethacin and Diclofenac**

Sprague-Dwaley rats (180-220 gm) were used for this study. Each group (control or experimental) of animals was maintained at 24±2° C. with 12 hrs lights and dark cycle. The animals were fasted for 24 hrs before the start of experiments. They were provided with water ad libitum to avoid food-induced increased acid secretion and its effect on gastric lesions. Gastric mucosal ulcer was developed by indomethacin as described (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010, Biswas, K.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 278:10993-11001; 2003, Bandyopadhyay, U.; et al. Life Sci. 71:2845-2865; 2002). Briefly, all the animals were divided into control, indomethacin and test compound group. Oral administration of indomethacin at a dose of 48 mg kg−1 b.w was given to the fasted animals to induce gastric ulcer. In the drug-pretreated groups, the animals were given drug (50, 20, 10, 5, 3, 1 mg kg−1 b.w.) intraperitoneally 30 min prior to ulcer induction with indomethacin. Control group received vehicle only but no indomethacin. After 4 hrs of indomethacin treatment, the animals were sacrificed under proper euthanasia and stomachs were collected. The mucosal injury was scored as ulcer index as follows: 0=no pathology; 1=one pinhead ulcer. The sum of the total scores divided by the number of animals gave the ulcer index. All the in vivo studies were done in accordance with the institute animal ethical committee guidelines. To see the effect of SEGA on diclofenac induced gastric mucosal injury, gastric mucosal damage was developed by the oral administration of diclofenac (75 mg kg−1) and the rest of the experiment was carried out in a similar way as described for indomethacin. Diclofenac produced pinhead ulcer like indomethacin and the mucosal injury was scored as ulcer index as described above. Ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury was developed with oral administration of 1 ml of 50% ethanol (Banerjee, R. K. (2002) Life Sci 71, 2845-2865) and after 4 hrs the animals were sacrificed and cold-restrain stress induced mucosal injury was developed by immobilizing the animals at 4° C. for 3.5 hrs (Banerjee, R. K. (2002) Life Sci 71, 2845-2865, (2003) J Biol Chem 278, 10993-11001).

**Example 18**

**Histology**

Stomach tissues from the animals of different groups were washed first washed several times with PBS (pH 7.4) and later fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 12 hrs at 25° C. The formalin-fixed tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for preparing semi-thin sections (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 283:14391-14401; 2008). The semi-thin sections were prepared using a microtome and taken over poly-L-lysine coated glass slide for hematoxylene-eosine staining. The stained sections were observed under microscope (Leica DM-2500, Germany) and were documented by high-resolution digital camera.

**Example 19**

**Healing Effect of SEGA on Indomethacin-Induced Gastric Damage**

Gastric mucosal injury was first induced with indomethacin treatment at a dose of 48 mg kg−1. After 4 hrs of the induction of mucosal injury, some of the animals were divided into two different groups (n=6), i.e., auto healing and SEGA-induced healing. This time point was referred as ‘0’ hr of healing. At this point of time, in the SEGA-induced healing group, SEGA was administered (i.p) at the dose of 50 mg kg−1 (this dose was selected from the dose-response curve). The animals, which were not treated with SEGA and received only indomethacin, served as the auto healing group. Starting from 0 hr, the stomach was dissected out from all groups at the intervals of 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 8 hrs respectively for measuring ulcer index as described (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 283:14391-14401; 2008) and histological studies.

**Example 20**

**Isolation of Mitochondria**

Commercially available kit (Biochain) was used for the isolation of mitochondria from gastric mucosal cells. In brief, scrapped gastric mucosa was finely minced on ice in a petridish containing mitochondria extraction buffer. Ultra-Turrax T-25 homogenizer was used to homogenize the cells. To remove nuclei and unbroken cells the homogenate was first centrifuged at 800×g for 10 min and then finally subjected to 12000×g for 15 min to get the mitochondrial fraction.

**Example 21**

**Measurement of Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress**

Mitochondrial oxidative stress was performed earlier through measurement protein carbonyl formation, lipid peroxidation and measurement of total thiol content (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010, Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009, Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 283:14391-14401; 2008, Maity, P.; et al. J. Pineal Res. 46:314-323; 2009).

Mitochondrial oxidative stress was studied earlier through the measurement of mitochondrial total thiol depletion, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation. In brief, thiol content was measured by its reaction with 5-5′-dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) to yield the yellow chromophore of TNB (thionitrobenzoic acid), which was measured at 412 nm Mitochondrial lipid peroxidation was assayed by adding 1 ml of the mitochondrial fraction in 0.9% normal saline to 2 ml of TBA-TCA mixture (0.375% w/v and 15% w/v, respectively) in 0.25 N HCl and was mixed and boiled for 15 min which was then cooled and after centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 535 nm. Tetraethoxypropane was used as standard. Protein carbonyl was measured by following the standard colorimetric method that measures the binding of dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) to the carbonyl group and was quantified by taking the absorbance at 362 nm.

**Example 22**

**Assay of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 Activities**

From cytosolic fraction of gastric mucosal tissues, caspase-9 and caspse-3 activities were measured using commercially available kit (Biovision, Mountain View, Calif., USA and Sigma respectively). In brief, the gastric mucosa was homogenized in caspase lysis buffer (provided with the respective kit). The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000×g for 15 min The supernatant was collected and mixed with 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer (provided with the respective kit). This was followed by addition of the substrates: Ac-DEDV-pNA (200 μM final concentration) for caspase-3 and LEHD-pNA (200 μM final concentration) for caspase-9. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 1 hr and absorbance was taken at 405 nm (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009, Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 283:14391-14401; 2008, Maity, P.; et al. J. Pineal Res. 46:314-323; 2009).

**Example 23**

**Cell Culture**

Gastric mucosal cells were isolated and cultured as described earlier (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010) with slight modification. Mucosa from rat stomach was scraped into HBSS (pH 7.4) containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100-μg/ml streptomycin. The mucosa was then minced and suspended in HBSS (pH 7.4), containing 0.05% hyaluronidase and 0.1% collagenase type I. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37° C. in 5% CO2 environment with shaking and then filtered through a sterile nylon mess. The filtrate was centrifuged at 600×g for 5 min, the cell pellet was washed with HBSS (pH 7.4) and further centrifuged. The pellet was incubated in 5 ml of Hans F-12 media in T25 flask supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin, 100-μg/ml streptomycin and gentamycin. Cells were cultured at 37° C. with 5% CO2 and grown to ˜90% confluence before treatment. 90% of the cells, obtained following this protocol, possessed epithelial characteristics.

**Example 24**

**Measurement of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨm)**

Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured as described (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009, Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 283:14391-14401; 2008, Maity, P.; et al. J. Pineal Res. 46:314-323; 2009). Mitochondria were isolated from gastric mucosal scraping using Mitoisolation kit (Biochain) as described above. Equal amount of mitochondria (25 μg) from each group (control, indomethacin, diclofenac and SEGA pre-treated indomethacin, diclofenac treated) was taken in 100 μl of JC-1 assay buffer (100 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 550 mM KCl, 50 mM ATP, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sodium succinate, 5 mM EGTA) and were incubated in dark with JC1 (300 nM) for 15 min at 25° C. The fluorescence of each sample was measured in a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophtometer (excitation 490 nm, emission 530 nm for JC-1 monomer and emission 590 nm for JC-1 aggregates). ΔΨm was expressed as fluorescence ratio of 590 nm/530 nm.

**Assay of Mitochondrial Dehydrogenase Activity**

Mitochondrial metabolic function was studied by observing the ability of mitochondrial dehydrogenases to reduce MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]) into formazan dye (Pal, C; et al. Free Radic Biol Med, 49(2), 258-267; 2010). Equal number of gastric mucosal primary cultured cells were taken (106) in each well of a 12 well plate and were divided into three groups control, indomethacin treated (5 mM) and SEGA (50 μM) plus indomethacin (5 mM)-treated. After incubating for 16 hrs, cells were dissociated and centrifuged at 500×g for 5 min and the supernatant was then discarded. Cell pellet was reconstituted in fresh cell culture media. Equal number of cells (105 cells) in a final volume of 100 μl cell culture media from each group was then taken in 96 well plates in triplicates. MTT (0.1% final concentration) solution was added to each well of both control and experimental groups, mixed well and incubated for 3 hrs at 37° C. in a CO2 incubator. After the incubation, the culture medium was aspirated carefully and the insoluble formazan crystals at the bottom of the well were solubilized with 100 μl of MTT solubilization solution containing 10% Triton X-100 plus 0.1 N HCl in anhydrous isopropanol. The MTT reduction (absorbance of formazan dye) was measured at 570 nm.

**Measurement of Intra Mitochondrial Superoxide**

Isolated mucosal cells from both control and indomethacin-treated cultured gastric mucosa were used for detection of intra mitochondrial superoxide using MitoSOX, an superoxide-sensitive fluorescence probe following the protocol as described in the product catalogue (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009). Cells were stained with the respective fluorescent probe in HB SS (pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 min at 37° C. in the dark as described in the manufacture's protocols. After the incubation, cells were washed with HBSS three times and continued for fluorescence microscopy (Leica, DM-2500, Leica Microsystems). Staining of MitoSOX was visualized using Red filter.

**Measurement of Free Iron**

Isolated mucosal cells from both control and indomethacin-treated cultured gastric mucosa were used for free iron localization using Phen Green SK, an iron-sensitive fluorescence probe following the protocol as described in the product catalogue (Maity, P.; et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284:3058-3068; 2009). Cells were first incubated with Phen Green SK (20 μm) for 15 min at 37° C. in the dark. After the incubation, cells were washed with HBSS and used for fluorescence microscopy (Leica, DM-2500, Leica Microsystems). Staining of pheen Green SK was visualized using green filter.

## ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION

The synthesized derivatives of the present invention have several advantages.


- - 1. These derivatives can chelate free iron, prevent oxidative stress
    by scavenging ROS and simultaneously offer antiapoptotic effect in
    vitro.
  - 2. These derivatives have the ability to prevent the formation of
    iron-mediated .OH as well as scavenge ROS in vivo. We have shown
    that these derivatives can prevent gastric mucosal oxidative stress
    and gastropathy by preventing ROS-mediated activation of apoptosis
    in gastric mucosal cells induced by NSAIDs.
  - 3. This invention provides a new small molecule having
    gastroptotective efficacy and a new strategy for drug discovery in
    gastropathy
