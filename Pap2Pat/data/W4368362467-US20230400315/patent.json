User preferences for scenery during a trip from one location to another can be quantified and used to augment standard routing methods by giving weight to scenic quality. The relative importance of urban-scenic interest (or scenic quality) as well as time, cost of travel, and/or distance can be set by the user, for example by utilizing a weight selection triangle, where the user chooses a balanced weighting of three factors, including scenic quality, before the system or method calculates the route from the starting location to the destination.",
                        "In an embodiment, a system for generating a route from a starting location to a destination can comprise: a processor; a display in operable communication with the processor; and a (non-transitory) machine-readable medium in operable communication with the processor and having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the processor, perform the following steps: receiving first data comprising the starting location, the destination, and a relative preference of a user of the system for scenic quality of the route compared to at least one other objective, the at least one other objective comprising time of the route, cost of the route, and distance of the route; utilizing map data to generate segments of potential paths between the starting location and the destination; running an algorithm (e.g., a weighted-shortest path algorithm) on the segments of potential paths, using the relative preference, to generate the route from the starting location to the destination; and displaying, on the display, the route to the user of the system. The relative preference can be set by the user using a weighted selection triangle; for example, the relative preference can comprise a weighted selection triangle of the scenic quality of the route and two other objectives, the two other objectives comprising two of the time of the route, the cost of the route, and the distance of the route. The instructions when executed can further perform the following step: quantifying the scenic quality of the route using values of properties along the segments of potential paths. The quantifying of the scenic quality of the route can comprise using publicly available data on the properties along the segments of potential paths (e.g., values of improvements of the properties along the segments of potential paths (i.e., valuations of buildings), unimproved values of the properties along the segments of potential paths (i.e., valuation of the land of the parcel, ignoring the value of the buildings, if any, thereon), or total values of the properties along the segments of potential paths). The instructions when executed further can perform the following steps: aggregating the values of the properties along the segments of potential paths, on a per-segment basis, to generate a set of aggregated values data; and normalizing the values in the set of aggregated values data, e.g., into a range of from 0 to 1 to generate a normalized set of values data. The normalized set of values data can be used to represent the scenic quality in the relative preference. The instructions when executed can further perform the following steps: receiving second data from the user of the system comprising whether the displayed route is acceptable; and if the second data indicates the displayed route is unacceptable, allowing the user of the system to update the relative preference, running the algorithm again using the updated relative preference to generate an updated route, and displaying the updated route to the user of the system. This process can be repeated until the user indicates the displayed route is acceptable, at which point the displayed route will be the final route (this can occur with respect to the first displayed route). The first data can further comprise at least one choice of the user of the system for types of properties to exclude or include in (the calculation of weights attached to segments of) the (potential) route(s) (e.g., minimum value, type of property (e.g., single-family residential)), and the running of the algorithm to generate the route can further comprise using the at least one choice.

User preferences for scenery during a trip from one location to another can be quantified and used to augment standard routing methods by giving weight to scenic quality. For example, a weighting triangle can be used, where a user chooses a balanced weighting of three factors, including scenic quality, before the system or method calculates the route from the starting location to the destination.",
                        "Many users of systems and methods that provide routing calculation and/or assistance desire that the routing include consideration pertaining to the scenic quality (e.g., scenic architectural quality) of the path or route from the starting location to the destination. For example, a user may desire a leisure walk via a route including what might be deemed as visually attractive architecture. Embodiments of the subject invention can quantify such user preferences and scenic quality to augment routing (e.g., standard routing methods) by giving weight to said scenic quality.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows an image of traditional routing from a starting location to a destination, optimizing the distance and/or time (i.e., the route is the shortest distance from the starting location to the destination). However, the homes along Pine Tree Drive (the road to the right (as depicted in FIG. 1) of the route taken) are much more expensive than those on Sheridan Avenue (the road with the route taken in FIG. 1) and, thus, potentially of heavier significance for scenic quality than those along the shortest route. FIG. 2 shows an image of routing that takes into account urban scenery or scenic quality, according to an embodiment of the subject invention. Referring to FIG. 2, this routing results in a slightly longer journey, with property values taken into account for scenic quality such that much of the journey is along Pine Tree Drive. If lesser, but not insignificant, weight is assigned to the urban-scenic interest (i.e., scenic quality) than in the routing for FIG. 2, then the route would be slightly shorter, yet still longer than that in FIG. 1; this routing is shown in FIG. 3, where a large portion of the journey is still along Pine Tree Drive.",
                        "In an embodiment, the relative importance of scenic quality (or urban-scenic interest), along with time, cost of travel, and/or distance, can be determined by utilizing a weight selection triangle, as seen in FIGS. 4A-4C (see also U.S. Pat. No. 10,061,501, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). A triangle can allow a user to assign importance weights to three decision optimization objectives. In some embodiments, the weight selection triangle can be displayed on a device (e.g., a smart device such as a smart phone; see also FIG. 4C) that allows a user to make selections of the relative importance of the objectives by touching the touchable triangle using a single gesture. Referring to FIG. 4B, a decision optimization objective a would be the only one considered if the user selected the point labeled \u201cA\u201d at the bottom-left of the triangle (as depicted in FIG. 4B); decision optimization objective b would be the only one considered if the user selected the point labeled \u201cB\u201d at the bottom-right of the triangle (as depicted in FIG. 4B); and decision optimization objective c would be the only one considered if the user selected the point labeled \u201cC\u201d at the top of the triangle (as depicted in",
                        "FIG. 4B). Points in the body of the triangle correspond to different weights of the relative importance of the three decision optimization objectives (a, b, c), based on the relative distances from the point touched by the user within the triangle to the three corresponding vertices of the triangle. FIG. 4C shows an example where multiple weighting points are selected, which can be for different types of routing for the same starting point and destination or for different routings (i.e., different starting point and/or destination).",
                        "FIG. 4A shows the underlying principle of the establishment of a single weight wa for objective a. FIG. 4B shows the triangle for all three objectives, allowing for the establishment of a tri-variable weight function (wa, wb, wc). The three objectives can be, for example, scenic quality, time, and cost of travel (distance may be substituted for time or cost of travel). By applying a finger gesture (or other commands on a non-touch-screen device such as a desktop computer or laptop computer), the user can move an indicator freely inside the triangle (see FIG. 4C). The position of the indicator establishes a tri-variable weight function, which can then be used as input for a co-optimization algorithm. When the user is satisfied with the established weights (i.e., the final position of the indicator), this can be indicated (e.g., by selecting or pressing a command or button labeled \u201cgo\u201d or \u201cokay\u201d or similar).",
                        "It may be the case that the mere consideration of property values might include properties of the kind that the user does not consider worthy of observing on the journey (i.e., do not add to scenic quality), such as commercial properties or industrial properties. The user may narrow down the values to be considered in the weighting algorithm to be restricted to one or more certain categories of properties from among a group of inclusion/exclusion constraints. FIG. 5 shows an image of a constraint selection, where \u201cResidential\u2014Single-family\u201d has been selected, and FIG. 6 shows an image of the routing that results from this selection, where the route has been optimized considering the scenic interest based on the values of single-family homes along the route, ignoring other property types. This routing removes, or at least minimizes, at least commercial properties and multi-family residences (among others, such as industrial properties) from contributing to the scenic quality routing criterion.",
                        "In an embodiment, additional constraints (e.g., potentially arbitrarily complex constraints) can be utilized for the inclusion or exclusion of types of properties in evaluating the scenic quality or urban-scenic interest. FIG. 7 shows an image with an example of such an additional constraint. For example, a user may cause the system to evaluate the scenic interest only of single-family homes with a lot size of at least 10,000 square feet. FIG. 8 shows an image of routing that takes into account the constraints depicted in FIG. 7.",
                        "The steps of the routing can be presented to the user via oral instructions, in graphic form (e.g., next to, over, or in lieu of the actual path taken for the journey based on the routing), or in textual form (e.g., next to, over, or in lieu of the actual path taken for the journey based on the routing). FIG. 9 shows an image of the routing from FIG. 8, with the routing steps presented in textual foam, presented partly over the path taken for the proposed journey based on the routing.",
                        "When determining scenic quality, the weighting desired by the user might be based on, for example, the total dollar value of the properties (or could be another related metric that can better capture the user's preferences, such as value per square foot of the properties). FIG. 10 shows an image of routing that takes into account scenic quality and in particular value per square foot of the properties. Referring to FIG. 10, the value per square foot of properties along the route (and in other locations near the route as well) is displayed, and the scenic quality criteria include the property value per building square foot rather than, or in addition to, the building value.",
                        "Rather than the entire property value, the user preference for weighting value may instead just be for the value of the structure (in real estate, this can be referred to as \u201cimprovements\u201d) or the value of the land without the structure (in real estate, this can be referred to as the \u201cunimproved land\u201d value). FIG. 11 shows an image of routing that takes into account scenic quality and, in particular, the unimproved land value of the properties. Referring to FIG. 11, the unimproved land values of the properties along the route (and in other locations near the route as well) are displayed.",
                        "In embodiments of the subject invention, the source of valuation of each property along a potential route from a starting location to a destination can be, for example, the assessed value of the property per county records, recent sale price, or current asking price from MLS records. In the case of a county assessed value, a user would typically choose for the purpose of the weighting, an objective value rather than tax valuation because the latter may be dependent on the property owner's status rather than only on the objective property quality. For example, in Florida, counties publish multiple \u201cvalues\u201d for the same home, including \u201cthe taxable value\u201d (i.e., the value against which the property tax is assessed and which takes into account the freezing of homestead property valuation and various discounts to which the current property owner may be entitled). A more objective county-published value in Florida is what the counties call the \u201cjust value.\u201d While it may or may not be a true reflection of the current value of the property, it is objective in the sense that the county applies the same methodology to estimate the \u201cjust values\u201d of various properties; thus, it can be useful for the weighting utilized in embodiments of the subject invention. FIG. 12 shows the selection of the \u201cjust value\u201d data type and source for how the property values are determined for weighting.",
                        "FIG. 13 shows an image of several choices of various official valuation types available from Florida counties. Among these valuations, the most meaningful for urban-scenic (or scenic quality) routing purposes may be the \u201cjust value,\u201d while the land-value and building-value can also be meaningful. The other valuation types in FIG. 13 are affected by the demographics of the property owner and, thus, are not meaningful for urban-scenic routing purposes. Other objective metrics can be computed utilizing publicly available data about properties. For example, the value per square foot can be computed from the published official assessed home value and the published official home size, as depicted in FIG. 14.",
                        "FIG. 15 shows an image of routing that takes into account scenic quality derived from property values based on the current asking price in the real estate multiple listing service (MLS).",
                        "When the source property value is per-house, it can be translated into value weight per street segment using any appropriate statistical aggregation of data known in the art. FIG. 16 shows a printout of the source data allowing the system to compute a maximum and/or average property value along each segment (e.g., along the 4200 segment of Sheridan Avenue in Miami, Florida, United States). Other reasonable statistical aggregation functions can be used for the purpose of establishing the valuation of properties for the purpose of urban-scenic routing (i.e., routing while taking into consideration scenic quality). Such other reasonable statistical aggregation functions can include, for example, the median value, the average value after exclusion of low outliers (e.g., exclusion of the lowest 1%, 5%, or 10% of values), the median of the highest 20% of values, the number of homes valued at over a predetermined amount (e.g., $1 million), and/or the number of homes valued in a predetermined range (e.g., $1 million to $2 million) plus a multiplier (e.g., double) of the number of homes valued at over a predetermined amount (e.g., over the upper end of the predetermined range, such as over $2 million).",
                        "Sourcing property valuation per individual property (e.g., per house) and then their aggregation per street segment can be done using various statistical methods, as discussed above. In another embodiment, an already pre-aggregated compilation of property values can be used if available (e.g., in the United States from the American Community Survey (ACS) or the United States Census (Census)). However, said data sources may have a sparser spatial granularity than a street segment, in which case the urban-scenic routing method would be slightly less precise. For example, the 4200 block of Sheridan Avenue and the 4200 block of Pine Tree Drive in Miami, Florida are within the same home valuation statistical area in ACS, and they are in the same block group in Census. Further, one street segment may lie on the boundary of two statistical areas, in which case the urban-scenic valuation of the street segment may combine the even side of the street segment and the odd side of the street segment.",
                        "In many embodiments, after property values have been aggregated (e.g., per street segment), for example, using any of the aforementioned per-house or sparser data sources, the aggregated values can be normalized over the entire relevant map portion (containing all likely segments for routes between the starting location and the destination). For example, the aggregated values can be normalized into a range of 0 to 1. Thereafter, the total normalized value of each street segment can be computed by considering said normalized values in conjunction with other criteria (e.g., the street segment's expected travel time). Relative weights can be assigned to the various criteria, using a method for assigning weights to different objectives (e.g., the aforementioned weight selection triangle (see FIGS. 4A-4C)). Once a route is computed, it can be presented to a user for approval (e.g., by being displayed on a display in operable communication with a processor executing steps for the routing). If the routing is presented to the user in a graphic form, it may be further enhanced in various visual forms to inform the user and let the user visually confirm that the choice of the route shows what the user intended or have the user adjust the relative weights and/or criteria. For example, overhead imagery of the properties that the user would pass by or encounter (on the currently-offered route) can be displayed, as shown in FIG. 17. Another example is to display photographs of facades of the properties (i.e., facades of houses) that the user would pass by or encounter (on the currently-offered route), as shown in FIG. 18. Another example is to display photographs of oblique (or bird's eye) views of the properties (e.g., of houses on the properties) that the user would pass by or encounter (on the currently-offered route), as shown in FIG. 19. After viewing the currently-offered route, possibly in conjunction with additional graphical items (such as the overhead images, fa\u00e7ade images, and/or oblique angle images), the user can then confirm the route or adjust the relative weights and/or criteria.",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention provide a focused technical solution to the focused technical problem of how to address user preferences for navigating while taking scenic quality into consideration. Embodiments of the subject invention improve the device on which the processor is located by minimizing the resources dedicated to searching (e.g., for scenery along potential paths between a starting location and a destination) and changing a calculated route in view of results of such searching. This is accomplished by providing a route generated with scenic quality already accounted for.",
