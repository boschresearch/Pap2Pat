                        "The need for increased protein consumption via meat production in a sustainable manner globally, is directly linked with the need for reduction of the overall production cost. This certainly remains the primary objective within the pig and broiler chicken industry with the feed cost having the biggest impact. The high and unpredictable variability of raw material costs (cereals, proteins and fats) and the ever growing and complex load of toxins contamination continue to negatively impact productivity.",
                        "Several stress factors such as handling, sudden environmental changes, heat, feed programs & diet composition changes, vaccination, disease challenges, infections and impaired immune response are affecting animal health and productivity. Modern farming animals possess a limited natural resistance and immunity against such stresses leading often to oxidative stress, when the animal is no longer capable of detoxifying timely the reactive oxygen species at cell level. The impact of such stress factors is worsened and amplified in the presence of mycotoxins.\n\n\n- - Mycotoxins decrease the function of key metabolic organs such as the\n    liver and kidneys.\n  - Mycotoxins have a significant negative impact on the poultry and\n    swine defense mechanisms and immune system.\n  - For example, fumonisins & deoxynivalenol (DON) predispose to the\n    development of necrotic enteritis in broilers.",
                        "In today's environment, the presence of mycotoxins is an inherent risk. Chances are high that multiple mycotoxigenic molds such as Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium and the related toxins creep into silos and corn silage at harvest and after ensiling. A recent survey highlighted that 99% of grain samples collected contained mycotoxins and over 85% contained multiple mycotoxins. More than 400 types of mycotoxins have been identified so far, also diverse in their chemistry and effect on animals. Feed contaminated with mycotoxins causes a broad spectrum of problems ranging from reduction in feed intake and growth performance to compromised reproduction, health and immunity. Symptoms are often non-specific and cost the agricultural sector billions of dollars per annum.",
                        "Feed dietary mycotoxins can also end up in animal products destined for human consumption such as milk, eggs and meat where they remain as stable and inert toxic molecules but their fate is unknown once within the human body.",
                        "Under normal conditions multiple-mycotoxin contamination is likely. Multiple mycotoxins can have a synergistic or additive negative effect, increasing the overall negative impact on animal's performance and health. Mycotoxins from fungi in feed combined with bacterial toxins further increase the negative health issues.",
                        "Mycotoxins may also occur in a conjugated form either soluble (masked or modified mycotoxins produced by fungi and/or plants) or incorporated onto/associated with/attached to macromolecules (bound mycotoxins). That effectively means that not only \u2018parent\u2019 mycotoxins but also their fungal and plant metabolites need to be quantified precisely for an appropriate feed risk assessment. However, individual raw material (grains/seeds) and/or feed sampling for mycotoxin analysis, although a critical factor, is often overlooked due to the high cost and the relative long (analysis) time involved. Moreover, the sampling itself of raw materials constitutes a major limitation due to the existence of what is known as \u2018hot\u2019 spots and the estimated relevant error occurrence during the sampling procedure is \u02dc88%. Additionally, mycotoxin analysis of the raw materials does not necessarily warrant a true representation of the final feed that the animal consumes, as more mycotoxin transformations may take place during storage. Also, producers often rely on quick and often cheap(er) analysis tools for mycotoxin detection such as Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs) and ELISAs. While most of the LFDs provide qualitative results, some more recent versions of LFDs and all ELISAs provide quantitative results. However, both methods are limited in the fact that a) cross-reactivity may occur which in turn can invalidate the results and thereby, impact scientific reproducibility and that b) only one mycotoxin can be detected at a time and that not all tests are fit for different types of feed. Thus, this approach proves either insufficient or uneconomical for a full feed risk assessment.",
                        "More importantly, inherently, the feed risk assessment approach per se does not provide a true representation of the true exposure of animals to mycotoxins. Only methodological approaches that aim/allow a) the detection of several mycotoxins and their Phase I and Phase II metabolites b) with high analytical precision, c) in biological fluids in animals and d) with a practical, user-friendly as well as easy to sample and transport method can provide such meaningful information. It is only then when someone can get a true representation of the mycotoxins and their metabolites that systemically enter and expose the animal.",
                        "Reference is hereby made to a Research Paper entitled \u201cMulti-mycotoxin analysis using dried blood spots and dried serum spots\u201d by B. Osteresch, S. Viegas, B. Cramer and H-U Humpf in Anal. Bioanal. Chem (2017) 409:3369-3382; (Osteresch et al. 2017)",
                        "This study discloses a multi-mycotoxin approach for biomonitoring and quantification of 27 important mycotoxins and mycotoxin metabolites in human blood samples.\n\nFor a.o. Dried Blood Spots (DBS), HPLC-MS/MS detection method is used.\n\nThe study establishes a validated multi-mycotoxin approach for the detection of 27 mycotoxins and metabolites in dried blood/serum spots based on a fast sample preparation followed by sensitive HPLC-MS/MS analysis.",
                        "However, this study deals exclusively with the application of the methodology to human applications and transfer of the proposed methodology to animals cannot be taken for granted.",
                        "In a first paragraph, in the introduction pg. 3370, it is stated that Dried Blood Spots (DBS) are suitable for extensive biomonitoring studies of environmental contaminants in humans or animals. More specifically, reference is made to study nr. 14 by Batterman S, Chernyak S, entitled \u201cPerformance and storage integrity of dried blood spots for PCB, BFR and pesticide measurements\u201d, Sci Total Environ. 2014; 494-495:252-60. This study investigates the suitability of DBS analyses for population studies of exposure to three chemical groups: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and chlorinated pesticides.",
                        "The collection of whole blood samples on paper, known as dried blood spot (DBS), dates back to the early 1960s in human newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders. The last five years, DBS-LC-MS/MS has emerged as an important method for quantitative analysis of several molecules/analytes. The DBS-LC-MS/MS approach has been expanded for different types of analytes in the human sector such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), pesticides (Batterman S and Chernyak S, 2014), hormones (Thomas and Thevis, 2018) and drugs (Wickremsinhe et al. 2018). However, the DBS-LC-MS/MS approach has not, yet, been adopted within the veterinary sector and no prior application for the detection of mycotoxins in farming animals is known to date. Several parameters need to be checked and validated for appropriate adoption on a particular animal species such as analytical sensitivity due to the small sample size, knowledge of the animal species-specific in vivo metabolism of mycotoxins to determine the most appropriate biomarker, potential impact of various blood sample properties on accurate quantification, sample quality, the impact of blood hematocrit, analyte stability, within day analytical variation, between days analytical variation etc.",
                        "In that context, it should be noted that this study by Batterman S, Chernyak S (2014) referenced in the introduction of this Research Paper refers to the detection of pesticides and other environmental toxic contaminants via DBS in animals, but not per se to mycotoxins. The transfer of the DBS concept for the detection of the environmental contaminants such as pesticides and heavy metals to mycotoxins, is neither simple nor evident or obvious.",
                        "In support hereof, it should be noted that PCBs, BFRs, and several classes of manmade chemicals such as pesticides are typically \u2018organo-synthetic\u2019 structures. Namely not naturally occurring structures as they carry one or more chlorine, bromine, fluorine (or other) atoms of non-naturally occurring elements within organic based structures.",
                        "As a result, not only their corresponding physicochemical properties but also their stability in DBS by application in paper based Find The Agent (FTA) cards may be totally different to that of mycotoxins, the latter being solely naturally occurring (organic) molecules. In fact, the authors Batterman & Chernyak, report that the DBS method proved stable at room temperature for pesticides and PCBs but not for Polybrominated Diphenyl ethers (PBDEs).",
                        "Differently phrased, one needs to perform substantive research efforts in order to determine:\n\n\n- - which mycotoxins and their specific (Phase I & Phase II) metabolites\n    should be targeted and bio-monitored;\n  - for a specific animal species and;\n  - for a specific biological sample (urine, blood, feces, excreta\n    etc.);  \n    as this relates directly to their unique metabolic pathway for a\n    specific animal species.",
                        "Further, even if satisfactorily responses to the above questions are at hand, there still remains the need for a reliable, cost-effective means and method so as to detect in a qualitative and quantitative manner the presence of such mycotoxins and its metabolites in a sample of the selected animal to be bio-monitored.",
                        "Until today, mycotoxins are determined in the animal production farming field only in feed. Feed analysis provides only a rough estimate of the risk involved in relation to the amount of mycotoxins that animals could be exposed to. Moreover, feed analysis is prone to significant methodological errors due to the presence of hotspots and the difficulty of determining masked mycotoxins, both leading to underestimation of the risk. Therefore, although the feed risk assessment still remains a tool, its real usefulness, when applied in isolation, remains highly questionable as it lacks vital information with regards to the true exposure of animals to mycotoxins.",
                        "Additionally, routine mycotoxin biomonitoring methods do not include mycotoxin phase I and phase II metabolites. This may significantly underestimate mycotoxin exposure especially for heavily metabolized mycotoxins. Additional research efforts are also needed to measure metabolites in vivo after exposure and to establish which mycotoxin metabolites should be prioritized for the inclusion during biomonitoring efforts.",
                        "As a result, there remains a clear need for a cost effective and reliable method for determining the true exposure of mycotoxins to animals, broiler chicken and pigs in particular."

Such method comprises the following two steps:\n\n\n- - sampling the blood by collecting dried blood samples;\n  - preparing the dried blood sample for analysis;\n  - analyzing the dried blood samples.",

                        "The latter are mainly non-specific and associated with either the effect or the mechanism of mycotoxins. The effect-based biomarkers are even less specific than the mechanism-based. A typical example is the alteration in feed intake after administration of deoxynivalenol. The direct biomarkers are specific and directly linked to the exposure. This type of biomarker is often the mycotoxin itself or their phase I and II metabolites. In biomonitoring, the direct biomarkers are the preferred biomarkers.",
                        "The detection of biomarkers can occur in easily accessible matrices of the animal to be bio-monitored, such as blood, urine or feces.",

                        "Peak concentrations can be detected in the blood and the concentration in blood is directly related with the exposure. Plasma is thus a good matrix to measure mycotoxins a few hours after exposure.",
                        "The time at which mycotoxins are absorbed by the animal varies substantially between the various mycotoxins and between animal species. The inventors have determined after experiments that the optimal time slot for the detection of such mycotoxins, is to collect the dried blood sample after 30 minutes up to two hours after feeding, preferably approximately 1 hour after feeding the animal.",

The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.",
                        "Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form of purification. Analytical chromatography is done with smaller amounts of material and is for establishing the presence or measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. For the purpose of the present invention, analytical chromatography is applied.",

The results are typically presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. In the present case, mass spectrometry is applied to a quite complex organic mixture.",
                        "A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.",
                        "In the MS procedure as applied in the present invention, a sample, being the collected dried blood sample, extracted, dried and reconstituted as described below, is ionized. This will cause some of the sample's molecules to break into charged fragments or simply become charged without fragmenting. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The molecules in the dried blood sample are then identified either through a characteristic pattern for the whole of the mycotoxin or phase I metabolite molecules or through a characteristic pattern for the fragments of the mycotoxin or metabolite molecules.",
                        "The term \u201cLiquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC MS/MS)\u201d as used in the context of the present invention should be understood as Liquid Chromatography, followed by Mass Spectrometry. In such a case the Dried Blood Sample, after being extracted in the extraction solvent, being dried and reconstituted in the reconstituting solvent, is injected in the column of the Liquid Chromatography apparatus; the various mycotoxins and phase I metabolites, exiting the Liquid Chromatography column, are then subjected to an identification and quantification analysis by a Mass Spectrometry apparatus, based on a targeted approach.",

                                "To that end, tests have been run on three different days as well within a day, and the mean values have been calculated based on these results.",

The r ranged between 0.991 and 0.999 for pigs and between 0.993 and 0.998 for broiler chickens. The g-value varied from 6% to 17% in pig and 8% to 19% in broiler chicken DBSs. Most of the calibration curves matched a linear model with a 1/x weighing factor, except for the ENNs and BEA which are best described by a quadratic model with a 1/x weighing factor. For most mycotoxins, the linearity ranged between 0.5 and 200 ng\u00b7ml\u22121. However, the limit of quantification (LOQ) and thus the lowest concentration in the calibration curve was set at 1 ng\u00b7ml\u22121 for ZEN, AZAL, BZEL, ZAN, DOM1 and AME in pigs and for ZEN, AZAL, BZAL, ZAN, AOH, T2, ENNA and FB1 in broiler chickens. In broiler chickens, AZEL had an LOQ of 4 ng\u00b7ml\u22121 and FB2 2 ng\u00b7ml\u22121 and in pigs AOH had an LOQ of 10 ng\u00b7ml\u22121. The results for the LOQ and corresponding LOD values are found in Table 1 and Table 3, respectively.",

Moreover, in pig DBSs, good extraction recovery rates were also observed. For some components, SSE was more pronounced and extraction recovery was rather low (<60%). However, for all mycotoxins, an adequate internal standard (IS) and matrix-matched calibration curves were used, resulting in validation results for accuracy and precision matching the acceptance criteria. The results for matrix effects and extraction recovery are shown in the Tables set forth is said publication.",

Exposure at an individual level\n    takes variation in food consumption and ADME parameters into account\n    and integrates contamination from all different sources leading to a\n    more accurate estimation and possible use in toxicokinetic studies.\n    (ADME stands for Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,\n    all of these toxicokinetic parameters describing the effect of the\n    animal body on the toxins concerned,)\n  - 2) Although feed is an accessible matrix, it is difficult to sample\n    correctly due to the presence of hotspots. Urine, feces and in\n    particular plasma/blood in contrast are easy to sample correctly and\n    also allow sequential sampling.\n  - 3) Measuring complete exposure: modified mycotoxins can convert back\n    to their original forms during digestion and so contribute to the\n    overall effect of the toxins. Biomonitoring includes these effects\n    and gives thus a very accurate estimation of the risk."
