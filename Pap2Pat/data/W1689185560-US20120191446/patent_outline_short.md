# DESCRIPTION

## THE NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT

- state no joint research agreement

## FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

- introduce parsing problem

## BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS

### 1. Generals Principles of An Embodiment of the Invention

- introduce parser generator system
- describe formal verification of grammar
- motivate advantages over prior art

### Example 1

- illustrate PEG grammar for mathematical expressions

### 2. Description of Some Embodiments

- extend PEGs with semantics actions
- define default semantic actions and conversion
- prove termination for PEGs
- define well-formedness analysis for PEGs
- interpret PEGs and obtain certified parser interpreter
- develop generic interpreter for parsing input with arbitrary grammar
- develop parser generator for PEGs with total correctness guarantees
- extract parser generator from Coq development
- overcome shortcomings of parser generator approach

### 3. Summary of Three Embodiments of the Invention

- introduce three embodiments of parser generator/interpreter
- motivate parser interpreter with semantic actions
- describe parser generator with semantic actions
- motivate parser interpreter with parsing traces
- describe formal semantics of PEGs
- describe annexes for parsing expressions and grammar properties
