    "title": "Perinatal Maternal Administration of Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461 Prevents Allergic Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Birch Pollen Allergy",
    "date": "2012-07-06",
    "abstract": "The hygiene hypothesis implies that microbial agents including probiotic bacteria may modulate foetal/neonatal immune programming and hence offer effective strategies for primary allergy prevention; however their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. We investigated whether oral administration of Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461 to mothers during gestation/lactation can protect against airway inflammation in offspring in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy, and examined the immune mechanisms involved.BALB/c mice were treated daily with L. paracasei in drinking water or drinking water alone in the last week of gestation and during lactation. Their offspring were sensitized with recombinant Bet v 1, followed by aerosol challenge with birch pollen extract.Maternal exposure to L. paracasei prevented the development of airway inflammation in offspring, as demonstrated by attenuation of eosinophil influx in the lungs; reduction of IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in lung and mediastinal lymph node cell cultures; and reduced peribronchial inflammatory infiltrate and mucus hypersecretion. While allergen-specific IgE and IgG antibody levels remained unchanged by the treatment, IL-4 and IL-5 production in spleen cell cultures were significantly reduced upon allergen stimulation in offspring of L. paracasei treated mice. Offspring of L. paracasei supplemented mothers had significantly reduced Bet v 1-specific as well as Concanavalin A-induced responses in spleen and mesenteric lymph node cell cultures, suggesting the modulation of both antigen-specific and mitogen-induced immune responses in offspring. These effects were associated with increased Foxp3 mRNA expression in the lungs and increased TGF-beta in serum.Our data show that in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy, perinatal administration of L. paracasei NCC 2461 to pregnant/lactating mothers protects against the development of airway inflammation in offspring by activating regulatory pathways, likely through TLR2/4 signalling.",

                "The prevalence of allergic diseases in industrialized countries has increased rapidly over the past decades. The reasons for the steady increase are not yet fully understood. While genetic factors contribute to increased disease risk [1], [2], genetic predisposition and heritable factors cannot solely explain the rise in allergies. Rather, environmental factors such as reduced microbial stimulation of the immune system in infancy as a consequence of improved hygiene seem to play important roles. However, not only has the extrinsic microbial environment changed, but so has the composition of intestinal microbiota possibly due to differences in diet or over-use of antibiotics [3], [4]. Several studies have shown differences in the composition of gut microbiota between allergic and non-allergic children [5], [6], [7], [8] and reduced diversity of the infant\u2019s intestinal flora was associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization [9]. In a prospective study, children who later developed allergic disease were less often colonized with bifidobacteria during the first year of life [10]. Moreover, atopic sensitization was correlated with a reduced ratio of faecal bifidobacteria to clostridia in the early perinatal period [6]. These findings provide a rationale for use of probiotic bacteria to prevent allergic disease.",
                "There is evidence that events occurring in the first year of life and even before delivery have the potential to program persisting immunological phenotypes that determine the subsequent risk of allergic disease [11], [12]. Thus, pre-, peri-, and/or postnatal interventions offer a promising approach to modulate immune responses and promote a non-allergic status. Moreover, interventions during pregnancy/lactation might have considerable advantages in terms of convenience and compliance compared to child-directed interventions. Indeed, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that perinatal interventions with specific probiotic bacteria can mediate protection against infant allergic diseases [13].",
                "In animal studies, we have shown previously that probiotic bacteria might regulate the allergic phenotype through a number of different pathways including: (i) induction of Th1-type immunity [14]; (ii) generation of regulatory responses [15], [16]; (iii) and production of IgA [14]. Using a mouse model of allergic poly-sensitization, we recently demonstrated that Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461, a strain with the capacity to induce Th1 and regulatory responses in vitro [17], applied at the time of sensitization and challenge significantly suppressed airway inflammation and down-regulated allergen-specific immune responses [15]. In the present study we show that maternal supplementation with L. paracasei NCC 2461 protects against the development of allergic airway inflammation in offspring, likely mediated by induction of regulatory responses."

Indeed, ConA-stimulated splenocytes from offspring of L. paracasei\u2013supplemented mothers had significantly reduced secretion of IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 in comparison to splenocytes from offspring of control mice (Fig 6B-D ). Similarly, we observed a trend towards reduced secretion of Th1- and Th2-related cytokines by ConA-stimulated MLN cells in offspring of L. paracasei-treated mothers in comparison to offspring of sham-treated controls (IL-4: 6.3\u00b11.1 pg/ml vs. 10.2\u00b12.0 pg/ml, p\u200a=\u200a0.23; and IFN-\u03b3: 281.6\u00b193.5 pg/ml vs. 451.8\u00b1133.5 pg/ml, p\u200a=\u200a0.35; perinatal L. paracasei vs. perinatal sham, respectively; n \u22653 per group; data from 2 separate experiments which each yielded similar results)."

                        "We have shown previously that intranasal application of L. paracasei led to increased mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors in draining lymph nodes [15]. We therefore investigated whether TLR2 or TLR4 are functionally involved in mediating the L. paracasei induced regulatory responses observed in this study. Stimulation of spleen cells from na\u00efve wild type mice with L. paracasei induced production of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production were markedly reduced in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 derived splenocytes (Fig 7A-B ). L. paracasei-stimulated splenocytes from TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice had markedly impaired production of TGF-\u03b2 while IL-10 production remained unchanged compared to wild-type splenocytes (Fig 7A-B ). As expected, the production of cytokines triggered either by LPS (TLR4 ligand) or Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 ligand) was completely abrogated in spleen cells from TLR4\u2212/\u2212 or TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively (Fig 7A-B ). Thus, L. paracasei mediates the production of regulatory cytokines through TLR4 and partly through TLR2."

                "In this study we have shown that perinatal administration of L. paracasei NCC 2461 to pregnant/lactating mothers markedly attenuated allergic airway inflammation in their offspring. The protective effects were likely mediated by activation of regulatory pathways, signalling through TLR2 and/or TLR4 and were associated with suppression of both local and systemic immune responses.",
                "Our findings are consistent with a recent clinical trial which showed that administration of a combination of probiotic strains to women during pregnancy and lactation without direct infant supplementation reduced the prevalence of eczema at 2 years [23]. The fact that direct infant intervention with probiotics may not be an absolute prerequisite for beneficial outcomes in offspring is an exciting observation, as there are considerable advantages in terms of convenience and compliance offered by maternal as compared to child-directed interventions.",
                "There is a strong body of evidence suggesting a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for modulation of infant immune responses during late gestation and the early perinatal period [13], [24], [25]. Indeed, farm exposure during pregnancy (as compared to postnatal farm exposure) was associated with the strongest protective effect against development of allergy [26]. We took advantage of this early \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d and proved that intervention with L. paracasei during the process of maturation of immune system leads to anti-allergic phenotype in offspring. Nevertheless, our experimental approach does not allow us to distinguish whether the L. paracasei-driven effects were due to the prenatal intervention alone or to the combination of prenatal and early postnatal treatment.",
                "Recently, it has been shown that prenatal maternal exposure to Acinetobacter lwoffii F78 prevented the development of asthma in the progeny which was associated with changes in H4 acetylation at the IFNG promoter [27], [28], [29]. Our findings support the intriguing possibility that stimulation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy with specific probiotic strains may generate signals that induce reprogramming of foetal immune responses, thereby protecting the offspring from development of allergic disease.",
                "We observed that reduced airway inflammation in offspring after aerosol challenge with birch pollen was independent of changes in antibody titres in serum, which were not reduced by maternal exposure to L. paracasei. This situation is similar to human studies, where combined prenatal/postnatal probiotic treatment had no effect on atopic sensitization despite conferring a reduced prevalence of eczema (reviewed by Tang et al. [13]). Furthermore, our observations are in agreement with a study published by Bl\u00fcmer et al., where perinatal Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation suppressed allergic airway inflammation in offspring without having an impact on allergen-specific immunoglobulin titres in serum [30]. Similarly, as described in our study with L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus primarily induces IL-10 production in vitro [31]. On the other hand, other probiotic strains, such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, eliciting the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, have been shown to reduce allergen induced IgE-dependent basophil degranulation or directly inhibit IgE production in sera [32], [33]. In these cases the reduction of allergic immune responses is associated with a shift from typical Th2-based allergic responses to Th1-type immune responses. These observations indicate the complex character of probiotic applications which precise mechanism of action has to be still investigated as well as the clinical consequences.",
                "Furthermore, perinatal L. paracasei treatment increased the production of gut IgA in offspring. Similarly, we have shown previously that intranasal application of probiotic bacteria enhanced production of secretory IgA in BAL of adult mice [14], [15]. Secretory IgA might act as \u201cblocking antibody\u201d by capturing and neutralizing of the allergens. Recently, Smits et al. proved elegantly that secretory IgA plays a prominent role in preventing the onset of allergic inflammation in a mouse model [21]. In a clinical trial, daily consumption of probiotic bacteria induced beneficial effects on allergic responses which were accompanied by a significant increase in mucosal IgA [34]. However, the importance of increased intestinal IgA in our model remains to be investigated.",
                "With respect to cellular responses, the production of both Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) cytokines was markedly reduced in re-stimulated spleen cells by maternal L. paracasei-treatment. This data are in agreement with our previous work, where the application of L. paracasei to the nasal mucosa led to reduction of allergen-specific Th2 responses as well as of IFN-\u03b3 in re-stimulated spleen cells [15]. This broad suppression in T cell responsiveness might be an explanation for the observed anti-inflammatory effects in the airways of offspring in the present study.",
                "Surprisingly, maternal L. paracasei-treatment reduced production of IL-10 by allergen-re-stimulated splenocytes from offspring. This phenomenon was also observed in our previous study, where mucosal application of L. paracasei in a model of allergic poly-sensitization reduced IL-10 production in splenocytes [15], while allergic poly-sensitization and airway challenge itself was associated with increased IL-10 production. We therefore hypothesise that IL-10 is produced as part of a compensatory mechanism to control allergic inflammation, and so may be reduced following L. paracasei treatment if there is associated abrogation of allergic inflammation.",
                "Notably, perinatal application of L. paracasei was associated with suppression of both antigen-specific and mitogen-induced responses in offspring. It remains important to evaluate whether intervention with certain probiotic strains might interfere with active immune responses against infections or vaccines. Even though such an effect has not been reported in published clinical trials, the question deserves to be evaluated in detail and may lead to additional selection criteria for strains destined to perinatal interventions.",
                "De Roock et al. have shown that probiotic bacteria can induce functional Treg cells in vitro and block effector T cells function [35]. We have shown that stimulation of spleen or BM-DC with L. paracasei in vitro induced high levels of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and that L. paracasei-induced production of regulatory cytokines by splenocytes is mediated via TLR2 and/or TLR4. Interestingly, certain probiotic bacteria have been shown to prime DC to promote the development of Treg cells [36]. Although we have not directly explored this possibility, it is attractive to postulate that the beneficial effects of perinatal L. paracasei might, at least in part, be explained by the induction of Treg cells through L. paracasei-induced regulatory DC. There is a body of evidence suggesting that the TLR ligands play an important role in prevention of allergic disease [37], [38]. Our data clearly demonstrates that TLR2 and TLR4 are important for recognition of L. paracasei and signalling through these receptors leads to induction of regulatory cytokines. In support of this, Conrad et al. have shown that maternal perinatal exposure to cowshed-derived bacteria induced resistance to allergic disease in offspring and functional maternal TLR-signalling was prerequisite for the transmission of protection [39].",
                "In summary, our data demonstrate that maternal interventions by way of probiotic supplementation during gestation and the early postnatal period can modulate infant immune responses and thereby protect against unwanted allergic inflammation in the infant. This approach to disease prevention avoids direct interventions to the child, while having the capacity to influence regulation of immune responses in the infant."
