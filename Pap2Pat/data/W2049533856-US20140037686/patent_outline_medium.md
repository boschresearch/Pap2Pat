# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to perinatal administration of probiotic bacteria

## BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION

- introduce allergy prevalence
- discuss genetic and environmental factors
- explain allergic sensitization in childhood
- describe primary and secondary prevention
- discuss food and airborne allergens

### Gastrointestinal Microbiota and the Immune System

- introduce commensal gastrointestinal microbes
- discuss hygiene hypothesis
- describe association between microbiota and allergies
- explain differences in gut microbiota composition
- discuss probiotic interventions
- highlight importance of immunological status

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461
- describe administration to expectant females and/or lactating mothers and progeny

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Definitions

- define weaning period
- define sensitization

- describe administration with other compounds
- describe synergistic compounds
- describe carbohydrates and fat sources
- describe additional nutrients and additives

### Administration Period:

- describe administration period for expectant mothers
- describe administration period for lactating mothers and newborn babies

### Effect of the Probiotic Administration:

- describe effect of ST11 on allergy prevention
- describe previous study on ST11
- describe importance of probiotic strain and timing
- describe genetic loci in Lactobacillus plantarum
- describe passage of ST11 to infant
- describe reduction of allergic response
- describe reduction of airway inflammation
- describe reduction of IL-5 levels
- describe long-lasting immune imprinting

## Example 1

- demonstrate maternal supplementation with ST11 protects progeny from allergic phenotype
