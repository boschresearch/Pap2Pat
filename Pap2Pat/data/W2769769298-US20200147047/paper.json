    "abstract": "Treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma is an important therapeutic goal. Thus, it is important to identify and target mechanisms of resistance to improve therapy. The YAP1 and TAZ proteins of the Hippo signaling pathway are important drivers of cancer cell survival, and are BRAF inhibitor resistant factors in melanoma. We examine the role of YAP1/TAZ in melanoma cancer stem cells (MCS cells). We demonstrate that YAP1, TAZ and TEAD (TEA domain transcription factor) levels are elevated in BRAF inhibitor resistant MCS cells and enhance cell survival, spheroid formation, matrigel invasion and tumor formation. Moreover, increased YAP1, TAZ and TEAD are associated with sustained ERK1/2 activity that is not suppressed by BRAF inhibitor. Xenograft studies show that treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant tumors with verteporfin, an agent that interferes with YAP1 function, reduces YAP1/TAZ level, restores BRAF inhibitor suppression of ERK1/2 signaling and reduces tumor growth. Verteporfin is highly effective as concentrations of verteporfin that do not impact tumor formation restore BRAF inhibitor suppression of tumor formation, suggesting that co-treatment with agents that inhibit YAP1 and BRAF(V600E) may be a viable therapy for cancer stem cell-derived BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma.",

                "Nearly one-half of metastatic melanoma patients harbor a BRAFV600 mutation, the most common being BRAF(V600E) [1]. These constitutively-active mutants stimulate ERK1/2 and other signaling pathways to drive tumor cell survival [2, 3]. Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib are BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) that target BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma and have been shown to improve survival [4]. These agents are remarkably effective, but the majority of patients ultimately become resistant [4, 5]. Tumor cells utilize a number of strategies to circumvent these inhibitors, including activation of alternate survival pathways [3]. Hippo is an important signaling pathway that controls tissue and organ size [6] and is comprised of Mst1/2 kinases that phosphorylate LATS1/2 kinases which phosphorylate the nuclear adaptor factors, YAP1 and TAZ. In proliferating cells, YAP1 and TAZ localize to the nucleus where they interact with TEAD (TEA domain) transcription factors to drive cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, activation of LATS1/2 results in YAP1 and TAZ phosphorylation which causes these proteins to relocate to the cytoplasm where they are degraded [6, 7] leading to reduced proliferation. Hippo signaling is frequently reduced in tumors leading to enhanced nuclear YAP1/TAZ accumulation and activation of cell proliferation [6, 8]. In melanoma, reduced Hippo pathway signaling is associated with enhanced tumor formation and metastasis [9\u201311]. Recent reports [12, 13] identify YAP1/TAZ as BRAFi resistance factors in melanoma. These studies suggest that BRAFi treatment promotes remodeling of the cytoskeleton that promotes nuclear accumulation and activation of YAP1/TAZ [13]. This is consistent with the known activation of YAP1 in response to cytoskeletal changes [14]. An additional study suggests that YAP1 confers apoptosis resistance by increasing BCL-xL expression [12].",
                "In the present report, we extend these studies using melanoma cancer stem cells (MCS cells) and show that BRAFi resistant MCS cells display elevated YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels, and that this is associated with enhanced spheroid formation, matrigel invasion and tumor formation, and that YAP1, TAZ or TEADs knockdown reduces these responses. Moreover, knockdown of individual TEAD proteins reduces matrigel invasion, but optimal suppression is observed following simultaneous knockdown of all four TEAD proteins. We further show that inhibition of YAP1 using verteporfin, an FDA approved drug [15] that inhibits YAP1 function [16\u201318], reduces YAP1/TAZ level and restores sensitivity to BRAFi. A striking finding is that treatment with low levels of verteporfin completely restores BRAFi suppression of tumor formation in BRAFi-resistant xenograft tumor models. This finding suggests that verteporfin, and related compounds, may be useful therapeutic agents in BRAFi-resistant melanoma."

                        "PLX4032 is an important BRAF(V600E)-targeting drug used for the treatment of melanoma that is commercially available as vemurafenib [4]. PLX4032 is highly effective in the short-term, but the tumors eventually become resistant [4, 19]. As models to study PLX4032 drug resistance, we used BRAF(V600E)-positive/PLX4032-sensitive A375 cells and created PLX4032-resistant cells (e.g., A375-PLX-R) by selection in PLX4032 containing medium. Figure 1A shows that, unlike A375 cells, proliferation of A375-PLX-R cells is not suppressed by PLX4032. To understand the mechanism of resistance, we first confirmed that the YAP1 and TAZ transcription adaptor proteins, and the TEAD transcription factors, have a role in drug resistance [12, 13, 20\u201324]. Figure 1B shows that YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels are increased in A375-PLX-R cells and that the increase in YAP1 level is associated with an increase in apparent YAP1 phosphorylation. Figure 1C shows that the YAP1 and TAZ increase is not due to a change in YAP1 or TAZ mRNA level. To confirm a biological role for these proteins, we performed knockdown and overexpression experiments. Figure 1D shows that treatment with PLX4032 or YAP1-siRNA reduces A375 cell proliferation, and that expression of constitutively active YAP1, YAP(S127A), reverses the PLX4032-dependent growth suppression. Moreover, we show that YAP1 knockdown reduces growth and restores A375-PLX-R cell response to PLX4032 (Figure 1D). TAZ also influences cell function. TAZ knockdown reduces A375 cell proliferation while TAZ overexpression partially reverses PLX4032-dependent growth suppression (Figure 1E). TAZ knockdown also partially restores sensitivity of A375-PLX-R cells to PLX4032 (Figure 1E). Figure 1F, 1G confirms the successful knockdown and overexpression of YAP1 and TAZ. These studies confirm previous studies [12, 13, 25] showing that YAP1 and TAZ are PLX4032 resistance factors."

                        "MCS cells can be selected by growth as spheroids and form rapidly growing, invasive and highly aggressive tumors as compared to non-stem melanoma cancer cells [26]. We therefore assayed the impact of PLX4032 treatment on MCS cell spheroids. Figure 2A, 2B shows that PLX4032 treatment suppresses A375 cell, but not A375-PLX-R cell, spheroid formation. Figure 2C shows that A375-PLX-R cell-derived MCS cells express elevated YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels as compared to A375 cell derived MCS cells. In addition, YAP1-P formation is increased and TAZ-P formation reduced. These results are generally consistent with observations in monolayer culture (Figure 1). Subcellular distribution is reported to influence YAP1 and TAZ activity in some cell types and so we determined if PLX4032 treatment influences YAP1/TAZ subcellular distribution. As shown in Figure 2D, we did not observe a major change in YAP1 intracellular distribution in control versus PLX4032-treated A375 cells, suggesting that altered YAP1/TAZ subcellular distribution does not explain the response to PLX4032.",
                        "We next measured PLX4032 impact on A375 and A375-PLX-R cell invasiveness using a matrigel invasion assay. MCS cells display enhanced invasion which is a measure of metastatic aggressiveness [26]. Figure 2E shows that A375-PLX-R cell invasion is enhanced by 50% compared to A375 cells, but that invasion is not suppressed by PLX4032 in either cell type. Figure 2F, 2G shows that although YAP1 or TAZ knockdown reduces invasion, PLX4032 treatment has no impact. These findings indicate that YAP1/TAZ knockdown does not sensitize the cells to PLX4032 with respect to matrigel invasion.",
                        "The above findings show that YAP1 and TAZ antagonize PLX4032 suppression of proliferation and spheroid formation. To understand the molecular mechanism of this antagonism, we monitored signaling changes in A375 cells following expression of YAP(S127A) and TAZ(S89A) and challenge with PLX4032. YAP(S127A) and TAZ(S89A) are constitutively actives forms of these proteins. Consistent with previous reports, BRAFi treatment reduces A375 cell ERK1/2 activity (Figure 3A, 3B). Moreover, this is associated with reduced cyclin B and cyclin A, and increased p21Cip1 and p27 (Figure 3A, 3B). PLX4032 treatment also enhances apoptosis as measured by increased accumulation of cleaved PARP and reduced levels of procaspase 8 and 9. Consistent with a role for YAP1/TAZ in attenuating PLX4032 action, these changes are reversed by expression of constitutively-active forms of YAP1 (Figure 3A) or TAZ (Figure 3B). These findings are consistent with a previous report suggesting that YAP1 and TAZ antagonize BRAFi action by suppressing apoptosis [12]. In addition, ERK1/2 signaling is suppressed in response to PLX4032 in A375 cells, but YAP(S127A) or TAZ(S89A) expression restores and maintains ERK1/2 signaling that is not reduced by PLX4032 treatment (Figure 3A, 3B)."

                        "YAP1 interacts in the nucleus with TEAD transcription factors to regulate gene expression leading to enhanced cell proliferation and survival [6, 16]. Since YAP1 can also interact with other targets [27], we determined whether YAP1/TEAD interaction is required for PLX4032 resistance. Figure 3C shows that YAP(S127A) expression can reverse PLX4032 suppression of A375 cell proliferation. We then monitored the ability of YAP(S127A) mutants, which cannot interact with selected cellular proteins, to replicate this response. YAP(S127A)(S94A) is a TEAD interaction domain mutant that is unable to interact with TEAD factors. YAP(S127A)(WW1), YAP(S127A)(WW2) and YAP(S127A)(WW1/WW2) have mutations in key tryptophan resides in the WW domains and cannot interact with WW domain binding proteins. YAP(S127A)(Dbl) is a double mutant combining the S94A and WW domain mutations, and YAP(S127A)(PDZbm) has a c-terminal 5 amino acid truncation that removes the PDZ binding domain [8]. We show that all of these constructs are able to restore cell proliferation in PLX4032-treated A375 cells, except for YAP(S127A)(S94A) and YAP(S127A)(Dbl). Both of these mutants encode the S94A mutation in the TEAD interaction domain which inactivates interaction with TEAD factors (Figure 3C, upper panel). This indicates that YAP1 antagonism of PLX4032-dependent growth suppression requires YAP1 interaction with TEAD factors. We next measured the impact of each mutant and PLX4032 treatment on A375 cell matrigel invasion. Figure 3C (lower panel) tests the requirement for YAP1/TEAD interaction in this context. This data confirms, as shown in Figure 2F, that YAP1 stimulates and PLX4032 does not regulate invasion. It also shows that all YAP(S127A) forms increase A375 cell matrigel invasion, except for the YAP(S127A)S94A and YAP(S127A)Dbl mutants that do not interact with TEAD factors.",
                        "We next examined the impact of TEAD factor knockdown on invasion in PLX4032 sensitive and resistant cells. PLX4032 resistant cells more efficiently invade matrigel as compared to PLX4032 sensitive cells (compare control group values in Figure 3D and 3E). Moreover, loss of individual TEAD proteins reduces invasion, and simultaneous loss of all TEAD factors results in the greatest reduction (Figure 3D, 3E). TEAD loss reduces PLX4032-resistant cell invasion (Figure 3E) to the level observed in untreated PLX4032-sensitive A375 cells (Figure 3D); however, PLX4032 treatment does not impact invasion (Figure 3D, 3E). We next examined the impact of PLX4032 on signaling in TEAD intact and knockdown A375 and A375-PLX-R cells. ERK1/2 phosphorylation is particularly interesting in that it is reduced in PLX4032-treated A375 cells in the presence or absence of TEADs. In contrast, ERK1/2 activity is only reduced in A375-PLX-R cells following TEAD knockdown and PLX4032 treatment (Figure 3F). In contrast, TEAD knockdown does not appreciably alter YAP1, YAP1-P, TAZ or TAZ-P levels in either cell line, and p21Cip1 levels are increased by PLX4032 treatment or TEAD knockdown (Figure 3F)."

                        "Identification of agents that suppress survival of PLX4032-resistant cells, or re-sensitize these cells to PLX4032, is an important goal. The experiments in Figure 1D suggest that interfering with YAP1 function may achieve this objective. YAP1 interacts with TEAD transcription factors to drive gene expression [6, 28] and a small molecular inhibitor called verteporfin has been reported to disrupt YAP1/TEAD interaction by binding to YAP1 and altering its structure [6, 16]. We therefore examined the impact of verteporfin treatment on spheroid formation and matrigel invasion in PLX4032 sensitive and resistant MCS cells. Figure 4A, 4B shows that verteporfin treatment suppresses A375 and A375-PLX-R spheroid formation by 50% at verteporfin concentrations as low at 0.1\u20130.25 \u03bcM and that spheroid formation is nearly completely inhibited at higher verteporfin concentrations. We also studied the effect of verteporfin on pre-formed spheroids. In this assay, spheroids are permitted to form for 8 d and then treated with verteporfin. We observe that 20 \u03bcM verteporfin treatment reduces spheroid number/integrity (Figure 4C) by 30 - 50% after a 3 d treatment. Prolonged treatment results in complete destruction of the spheroids (not shown). We next examined the impact of verteporfin on ability to invade matrigel. Figure 4D, 4E shows that matrigel invasion is 50% suppressed at concentrations of 0.5 - 1 \u03bcM verteporfin and that suppression is nearly complete at higher concentrations.",

Verteporfin treatment does not impact the level of YAP1 or TAZ mRNA (Figure 4F), but does reduce YAP1 and TAZ protein level (Figure 4G). As shown in Figure 4H, verteporfin treatment also reduces TEAD transcription factor level. The proteasome is known to regulate YAP1/TAZ level [29, 30] and so we examined whether the proteasome is responsible for the observed reductions. Figure 4I shows the verteporfin-dependent reduction in YAP1, TAZ and TEAD level is not reversed by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin.",
                        "We next assayed whether verteporfin treatment can restore PLX4032 sensitivity in resistant cells. A375-PLX-R cells were plated in spheroid growth conditions and treated with 0\u20131 \u03bcM PLX4032 in the presence of 0 or 1 \u03bcM verteporfin and spheroid formation was monitored. Figure 5A confirms that treatment with 0\u20131 \u03bcM PLX4032 does not suppress A375-PLX-R spheroid formation, but that co-treatment with 0.1 \u03bcM verteporfin restores PLX4032 suppression of spheroid number."

To assess the role of ERK1/2 we treated PLX4032 resistant cells with SCH772984, a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 [31], and monitored the impact on cell proliferation.

The increase in YAP1, TAZ and TEADs in PLX4032 resistant tumor-derived MCS cells reflects the changes observed in cultured PLX4032-resistant cells (Figure 2C), and indicates that elevated levels of YAP1, TAZ and TEAD factors are retained during growth in PLX4032 resistant tumors.

In contrast, LATS1 activity is reduced in proliferating cells leading to YAP1/TAZ accumulation in the nucleus and interaction with TEAD transcription factors to drive transcription of pro-growth/pro-survival genes [6]. The YAP1/TAZ transcription adaptor proteins and TEAD transcription factors are also important regulators in cancer cells, as Hippo activity is often reduced in tumors leading to increased nuclear accumulation of non-phosphorylated YAP1 and TAZ, and activation of proliferation-associated transcription and cell survival [6, 8]. YAP1, TAZ and TEAD can also mediate drug resistance [12, 23, 24].

This is biologically meaningful, as YAP1 or TAZ knockdown in BRAFi-resistant MCS cells, restores BRAFi sensitivity, and forced expression of constitutively active YAP1 or TAZ confers BRAFi resistance on sensitive cells. This role for YAP1 and TAZ was observed in PLX4032 resistant cell lines derived from A375, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28 and WM3248 cells. These findings confirm that BRAFi resistance in MCS cells is associated with enhanced expression of YAP1, TAZ and TEADs, a finding previously reported in non-stem melanoma cancer cells [9\u201312].",
                        "Matrigel invasion is a measure of MCS cell metastatic potential. Our studies reveal potentially important and unexpected features regarding melanoma cancer cell invasion, the role of YAP1/TAZ in this process, and the response to PLX4032 treatment. YAP1, TAZ and TEAD knockdown reduces MCS cell invasion and YAP1 or TAZ overexpression increases invasion, showing that YAP1, TAZ and TEADs play a key role in regulating this process. These findings are consistent with a study showing that YAP1 is required for metastasis of tail vein-injected melanoma cells [11]. In contrast, it is interesting that although PLX4032 suppresses MCS cell proliferation and spheroid formation, it does not suppress invasion in BRAFi sensitive or resistant MCS cells. This interesting finding indicates that PLX4032 does not suppress all biological responses associated with the MCS cell phenotype nor does it oppose all YAP1/TAZ/TEAD-stimulated biological responses. These findings have important implications for therapy, and suggest that the YAP1/BRAFi interplay may be more complicated than previously appreciated."

                        "BRAF(V600E) drives melanoma cell survival by activating ERK1/2 signaling [32]. We therefore studied the impact of PLX4032 on ERK1/2 level and phosphorylation. In inhibitor sensitive cells, PLX4032 suppresses ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, PLX4032 does not suppress ERK1/2 signaling in BRAFi-resistant cells. Moreover PLX4032 does not suppress ERK1/2 activity when constitutively-active YAP1 or TAZ are expressed in PLX4032-sensitive cells. These findings are consistent with previous reports [12, 33], and suggest that YAP1 and TAZ antagonize BRAFi action by maintaining ERK1/2 activity. If ERK1/2 is the key mediator, we would expect that ERK1/2 inhibitors should reduce BRAF-resistant cell survival and proliferation. In fact, treatment with an ERK1/2 specific inhibitor, SCH772984, suppresses survival of BRAFi resistant cells, suggesting that ERK1/2 activity is a key nexus that mediates YAP1/TAZ-associated resistance. Additional studies will be required to understand this role. PLX4032 treatment also reduces cyclin A and cyclin B level and increases p21Cip1 and p27, findings that are consistent with BRAFi suppression of cell proliferation. In addition, PLX4032 treatment increases apoptosis, as measured by increased PARP cleavage and reduced procaspase level. These responses are reversed by expression of constitutively-active YAP1 or TAZ, consistent with the idea that BRAFi suppresses cell growth and enhances cell death, and YAP1/TAZ antagonize these actions [12, 25]."

                        "The four TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1/2/3/4) are major downstream targets of YAP1 and TAZ [34\u201337] and the observed increase in TEAD factor level in PLX4032 resistant cells is consistent with a role in BRAFi resistance. However, YAP1 and TAZ can interact with targets other than TEAD factors to guide responses [27] and so we used genetic and knockdown approaches to confirm that TEAD factors mediate the YAP1/TAZ antagonism of PLX4032 action. We show that constitutively-active YAP1 reverses PLX4032 suppression of cell proliferation, and mutants of constitutively-active YAP1 that cannot interact with TEAD factors lack this ability, suggesting that YAP1/TEAD interaction is required for BRAFi resistance. In addition, TEAD knockdown or treatment with BRAFi produces similar changes in signaling. For example, TEAD knockdown restores the ability of PLX4032 to reduce ERK1/2 activity. In addition, we assessed the role of TEAD1, 2, 3 and 4 in a matrigel invasion assay. Knockdown of individual TEAD factors resulted in a similar reduction in MCS cell matrigel invasion, and maximal suppression was observed in response to simultaneous knockdown of all four isoforms. This suggests that all of the TEAD factors have biological activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that TEAD factors are the likely downstream targets of YAP1/TAZ in MCS cells, and that YAP1/TAZ and TEAD factor interaction is required for MCS cell survival and BRAFi resistance."

                        "One of the most interesting aspects of this report are the tumor findings. Verteporfin is a small aromatic heterocyclic molecule that disrupts YAP1/TEAD interaction [16, 35], and is an FDA drug approved for photodynamic therapy of neovascular macular degeneration that is marketed as Visudyne by Novartis [15]. We show that PLX4032 resistant MCS cells form large and highly aggressive tumors compared to non-PLX4032 resistant cells. We selected the BRAFi-resistant MCS cells for tumor studies, since they are the most aggressive cells with respect to tumor formation. We show that treatment with verteporfin reduces tumor formation and YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels. The ability of verteporfin to markedly suppress YAP1 and TAZ levels in cultured MCS cells suggested that it may be effective in restoration of BRAFi sensitivity in tumors. An important finding is that verteporfin reduces tumor growth and that this is associated with reduced YAP1/TAZ level. However, the most remarkable observation is that treatment with a concentration of verteporfin that does not suppress tumor formation restores PLX4032 suppression of tumor formation. A remarkable (80%) suppression of tumor size is observed in mice treated with the combination, and this was associated with PLX4032 suppression of ERK1/2 signaling in the verteporfin co-treated tumors. This combination of agents was well tolerated by the mice and suggests that verteporfin, or a related agent, may be useful in restore BRAFi action in human patients."
