                                "Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib are BRAF inhibitors that target BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma and have been shown to improve survival (4). These agents are remarkably effective, but the majority of patients ultimately become resistant (4,5).",
                                "Tumor cells utilize a number of strategies to circumvent these inhibitors, including activation of alternate survival pathways (3). Hippo is an important signaling pathway that controls tissue and organ size (6) and is comprised of Mst1/2 kinases that phosphorylate LATS1/2 kinases which phosphorylate the nuclear adaptor factors, YAP1 and TAZ. In proliferating cells, YAP1 and TAZ localize to the nucleus where they interact with TEAD transcription factors to drive cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, activation of LATS1/2 results in YAP1 and TAZ phosphorylation which causes these proteins to relocate to the cytoplasm where they are degraded (6,7) leading to reduced proliferation. Hippo signaling is frequently reduced in tumors leading to enhanced nuclear YAP1/TAZ accumulation and activation of cell proliferation (6,8).",
                                "In melanoma, reduced Hippo pathway signaling is associated with enhanced tumor formation and metastasis (9-11). Recent reports (12,13) identify YAP1/TAZ as BRAF inhibitors resistance factors in melanoma. These studies suggest that BRAF inhibitor treatment promotes remodeling of the cytoskeleton that promotes nuclear accumulation and activation of YAP1/TAZ (13). This concept is consistent with the known activation of YAP1 in response to cytoskeletal changes (14). An additional study suggests that YAP1 confers apoptosis resistance by increasing BCL-XL expression (12).",

PLX4032 is highly effective in the short-term, but the tumors eventually become resistant (4, 19). As models to study PLX4032 drug resistance, BRAF(V600E)-positive/PLX4032-sensitive A375 cells were used and created PLX4032-resistant cells (e.g., A375-PLX-R) were created by selection in PLX4032 containing medium. FIG. 1A shows that, unlike A375 cells, proliferation of A375-PLX-R cells is not suppressed by PLX4032. To understand the mechanism of resistance, the YAP1 and TAZ transcription adaptor proteins and the TEAD transcription factors were confirmed to have a role in drug resistance (12,13,20-24). FIG. 1B shows that YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels are increased in A375-PLX-R cells and that the increase in YAP1 level is associated with an increase in apparent YAP1 phosphorylation. FIG. 1C shows that the YAP1 and TAZ increase is not due to a change in YAP1 or TAZ mRNA level.",
                                "To confirm a biological role for these proteins, knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. FIG. 1D shows that treatment with PLX4032 or YAP1-siRNA reduces A375 cell proliferation, and that expression of constitutively active YAP1, YAP(S127A), reversed the PLX4032-dependent growth suppression. Moreover, YAP1 knockdown reduced growth and restored A375-PLX-R cell response to PLX4032 (FIG. 1E). TAZ also influenced cell function. TAZ knockdown reduced A375 cell proliferation while TAZ overexpression partially reversed PLX4032-dependent growth suppression (FIG. 1F). TAZ knockdown also partially restored sensitivity of A375-PLX-R cells to PLX4032 (FIG. 1G). FIGS. 1G and 1I confirm the successful knockdown and overexpression of YAP1 and TAZ. These studies confirm previous studies (12,13,25) showing that YAP1 and TAZ are PLX4032 resistance factors."

The impact of PLX4032 treatment on MCS cell spheroids was examined. FIGS. 2A-2B shows that PLX4032 treatment suppressed A375 cell, but not A375-PLX-R cell, spheroid formation. FIG. 2C shows that A375-PLX-R cell-derived MCS cells expressed elevated YAP1, TAZ and TEAD levels as compared to A375 cell derived MCS cells. In addition, YAP1-P formation was increased, and TAZ-P formation reduced. These results are generally consistent with observations in monolayer culture (FIGS. 1A-1I). Subcellular distribution is reported to influence YAP1 and TAZ activity in some cell types and so it was determined if PLX4032 treatment influences YAP1/TAZ subcellular distribution. As shown in FIG. 2D, there was no major change in YAP1 intracellular distribution in control versus PLX4032-treated A375 cells, suggesting that altered YAP1/TAZ subcellular distribution does not explain the response to PLX4032 (FIG. 2D).",
                                "The PLX4032 impact on A375 and A375-PLX-R cell invasiveness was measured using a matrigel invasion assay. MCS cells display enhanced invasion which is a measure of metastatic aggressiveness (26). FIG. 2E shows that A375-PLX-R cell invasion is enhanced by 50% compared to A375 cells, but that invasion is not suppressed by PLX4032 in either cell type. FIGS. 2F-2G shows that although YAP1 or TAZ knockdown reduces invasion, PLX4032 treatment has no impact. These findings indicate that YAP1/TAZ knockdown does not sensitize the cells to PLX4032 with respect to matrigel invasion.",
                                "The above findings show that YAP1 and TAZ antagonize PLX4032 suppression of proliferation and spheroid formation. To understand the molecular mechanism of this antagonism, signaling changes were monitored in A375 cells following expression of YAP(S127A) and TAZ(S89A) and challenge with PLX4032. YAP(S127A) and TAZ(S89A) are constitutively actives forms of these proteins. Consistent with previous reports, BRAF inhibitors treatment reduces A375 cell ERK1/2 activity (FIGS. 3A-3B). Moreover, this is associated with reduced cyclin B and cyclin A, and increased p21Cip1 and p27 (FIGS. 3A-3B). PLX4032 treatment also enhances apoptosis as measured by increased accumulation of cleaved PARP and reduced levels of procaspase 8 and 9. Consistent with a role for YAP1/TAZ in attenuating PLX4032 action, these changes are reversed by expression of constitutively-active forms of YAP1 (FIG. 3A) or TAZ (FIG. 3B). These findings are consistent with a previous report suggesting that YAP1 and TAZ antagonize BRAF inhibitors action by suppressing apoptosis (12). In addition, ERK1/2 signaling is suppressed in response to PLX4032 in A375 cells, but YAP(S127A) or TAZ(S89A) expression restored and maintained ERK1/2 signaling that is not reduced by PLX4032 treatment (FIGS. 3A-3B)."

Since YAP1 can also interact with other targets (27), it was determined whether YAP1/TEAD interaction is required for PLX4032 resistance. FIG. 3C shows that YAP(S127A) expression can reverse PLX4032 suppression of A375 cell proliferation. The ability of YAP(S127A) mutants, which cannot interact with selected cellular proteins, to replicate this response was monitored. YAP(S127A)(S94A) is a TEAD interaction domain mutant that is unable to interact with TEAD factors. YAP(S127A)(WW1), YAP(S127A)(WW2) and YAP(S127A)(WW1/WW2) has mutations in key tryptophan resides in the WW domains and cannot interact with WW domain binding proteins. YAP(S127A)(Dbl) is a double mutant combining the S94A and WW domain mutations, and YAP(S127A)(PDZbm) has a c-terminal 5 amino acid truncation that removes the PDZ binding domain (8). All of these constructs are able to restore cell proliferation in PLX4032-treated A375 cells, except for YAP(S127A)(S94A) and YAP(S127A)(Dbl). Both of these mutants encode the S94A mutation in the TEAD interaction domain which inactivates interaction with TEAD factors (FIG. 3C, upper panel). This indicates that YAP1 antagonism of PLX4032-dependent growth suppression requires YAP1 interaction with TEAD factors. The impact of each mutant and PLX4032 treatment on A375 cell matrigel invasion was measured. FIG. 3C (lower panel) tests the requirement for YAP1/TEAD interaction in this context. This data confirms, as shown in FIG. 2F, that YAP1 stimulates and PLX4032 does not regulate invasion. It also shows that all YAP(S127A) forms increase A375 cell matrigel invasion, except for the YAP(S127A)S94A and YAP(S127A)Dbl mutants that do not interact with TEAD factors.",
                                "The impact of TEAD factor knockdown on invasion in PLX4032 sensitive and resistant cells was examined. PLX4032 resistant cells more efficiently invade matrigel as compared to PLX4032 sensitive cells (compare control group values in FIGS. 3D-3E). Moreover, loss of individual TEAD proteins reduces invasion, and simultaneous loss of all TEAD factors results in the greatest reduction (FIGS. 3D-3E). TEAD loss reduced PLX4032-resistant cell invasion (FIG. 3E) to the level observed in untreated PLX4032-sensitive A375 cells (FIG. 3D) but PLX4032 treatment did not impact invasion (FIGS. 3D-3E). We next examined the impact of PLX4032 on signaling in TEAD intact and knockdown A375 and A375-PLX-R cells. ERK1/2 phosphorylation is particularly interesting in that it is reduced in PLX4032-treated A375 cells in the presence or absence of TEADs. In contrast, ERK1/2 activity is only reduced in A375-PLX-R cells following TEAD knockdown and PLX4032 treatment (FIG. 3F). In contrast, TEAD knockdown does not appreciably alter YAP1, YAP1-P, TAZ or TAZ-P levels in either cell line, and p21Cip1 levels are increased by PLX4032 treatment or TEAD knockdown (FIG. 3F)."

The experiments in FIG. 1D suggest that interfering with YAP1 function may achieve this objective. YAP1 interacts with TEAD transcription factors to drive gene expression (6,28) and a small molecular inhibitor called verteporfin has been reported to disrupt YAP1/TEAD interaction by binding to YAP1 and altering its structure (6,16). The impact of verteporfin treatment on spheroid formation and matrigel invasion in PLX4032 sensitive and resistant MCS cells was examined. FIGS. 4A-4B shows that verteporfin treatment suppresses A375 and A375-PLX-R spheroid formation by 50% at verteporfin concentrations as low at 0.1-0.25 mM and that spheroid formation is nearly completely inhibited at higher verteporfin concentrations. To demonstrate the effect of verteporfin on pre-formed spheroids, spheroids were permitted to form for 8 d and then treated with verteporfin. 20 mM verteporfin treatment reduced spheroid number/integrity (FIG. 4C) by 30-50% after a 3D treatment. Prolonged treatment results in complete destruction of the spheroids (not shown).

As shown in FIG. 4H, verteporfin treatment also reduced TEAD transcription factor levels. The proteasome is known to regulate YAP1/TAZ level (29,30) and so whether the proteasome was responsible for the observed reductions was examined.

Moreover, consistent with the cell culture findings, the A375-PLX-R spheroid cell-derived tumors expressed elevated levels of YAP1, TAZ and TEADs as compared to A375 spheroid cell-derived tumors (FIG. 6C). In addition, ERK1/2-P, cyclins A and B, and CDK4 levels were elevated in A375-PLX-R spheroid cell-derived tumors (FIG. 6C). p21Cip1 level was selectively slightly elevated in PLX4032-treated A375 spheroid cell-derived tumors (FIG. 6C), a finding that is consistent with their sensitivity to PLX4032 growth inhibition. The increase in YAP1, TAZ and TEADs in PLX4032 resistant tumor-derived MCS cells reflected the changes observed in cultured PLX4032-resistant cells, and indicated that elevated levels of YAP1, TAZ and TEAD factors were retained during growth in PLX4032 resistant tumors (FIG. 2C).

                                "To demonstrate that inhibition of YAP1 function may restore PLX4032 suppression of tumor formation, the impact of treatment with 20 mg/kg PLX4032 was measured in the presence of 0-100 mg/kg verteporfin on tumor formation by spheroid-derived A375-PLX-R cells. FIGS. 7A-7B shows that in the absence of verteporfin, PLX4032 did not suppress A375-PLX-R tumor formation. However, verteporfin treatment produces a dose-dependent reduction in tumor size. The key observation is that treatment with a low concentration of verteporfin (10 mg/kg), that does not suppress tumor formation, restores PLX4032-dependent suppression of tumor formation. An examination of the biochemical status of the 10 mg/kg verteporfin/20 mg/kg PLX4032-treated tumors revealed a reduction in YAP1, YAP1-P, TAZ and TEAD levels (FIG. 7C). In addition, in the presence of verteporfin, PLX4032 treatment reduced ERK1/2-P level. These findings show that treatment with low levels of verteporfin, that do not impact tumor formation, can re-sensitize tumors to PLX4032.",
