    "abstract": "Generation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide in Alzheimer\u2019s disease involves cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b3-secretase, a protease known to cleave several substrates, including Notch. Finding specific modulators for \u03b3-secretase could be a potential avenue to treat the disease. Here, we report that transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 6 specifically interacts with APP leading to inhibition of its cleavage by \u03b3-secretase and reduction in A\u03b2 production. TRPC6 interacts with APP (C99), but not with Notch, and prevents C99 interaction with presenilin 1 (PS1). A fusion peptide derived from TRPC6 also reduces A\u03b2 levels without effect on Notch cleavage. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with TRPC6 transgenic mice leads to a marked reduction in both plaque load and A\u03b2 levels, and improvement in structural and behavioural impairment. Thus, TRPC6 specifically modulates \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP and preventing APP (C99) interaction with PS1 via TRPC6 could be a novel strategy to reduce A\u03b2 formation.",

                        "We initially examined whether Ca2+ channels play a role in A\u03b2 production because Ca2+ entry can affect \u03b1-secretase cleavage of APP202122. We downregulated several Ca2+ channel proteins (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 10), including Cav1.2, Cav3.1 or Cav3.3, L- or T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel proteins; TRPC5 or TRPC6, nonselective cation channel proteins, in primary cultured rat cortical neurons and found that downregulating TRPC6, but not others, greatly enhanced both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Fig. 1a), suggesting that TRPC6 specifically regulates A\u03b2 accumulation in cortical neurons. However, treatment of the neurons with OAG or SKF96365, agents known to activate or block TRPC channels2324, respectively, did not influence the A\u03b2 levels (Fig. 1b). These results suggest that TRPC6 regulates A\u03b2 accumulation likely independent of its channel activity.",
                        "We then tested the effects of TRPC6 on A\u03b2 levels in HEK293APP stable cells, a cell model commonly used for studying A\u03b2 accumulation. All the A\u03b240, A\u03b242, A\u03b238 and A\u03b21-x levels in the culture medium of the cells transfected with TRPC6 were markedly reduced (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Figs 1a and 10). In contrast, expressing TRPC5 did not change the A\u03b2 levels (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 10). These results show that TRPC6 specifically regulates A\u03b2 accumulation in HEK293APP stable cells. Similar to its effect on A\u03b2 accumulation in the neurons, SKF96365 did not suppress the inhibitory effect of TRPC6 on A\u03b2 levels in HEK293APP cells (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 10). Meanwhile, expressing the dominant-negative form of TRPC6 (DN-TRPC6), a mutant known to suppress TRPC6 channel activity25, did not affect TRPC6 inhibition of A\u03b2 accumulation (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 10). Moreover, expressing DN-TRPC6 also reduced A\u03b2 levels (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 10). All together, these results provide evidences that TRPC6 inhibition of A\u03b2 accumulation is independent of its channel activity."

                        "We next observed that expressing TRPC6 did not alter the APP levels, sAPP\u03b1 production and expression of ADAM10 or BACE1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Fig. 15). Further, the enzymatic activity of \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretase, determined by in vitro assay using their respective fluorogenic substrates was not changed by TRPC6 (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The A\u03b2 can be cleared by enzymatic degradation or pumping into plasma2627. However, the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and clusterin, proteins known to affect A\u03b2 clearance, was not changed by TRPC6 (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e; Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, the A\u03b2 levels in the medium and cell lysate of HEK293 cells assayed by the A\u03b2 clearance test were not altered by TRPC6 (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Together, these results suggest that \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 clearance are not affected by TRPC6.",
                        "We then examined whether \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP was affected by TRPC6. Cleavage of C99 by \u03b3-secretase releases A\u03b2 peptides and APP intracellular domain (AICD)28. TRPC6 greatly reduced both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in the culture medium of COS7 cells stably expressing C99 (Fig. 2a). TRPC6 also downregulated AICD generation in HEK293C99 stable cells (Supplementary Figs 2g, 11 and 15; Fig. 2b,c). In addition, TRPC6 did not affect CTF (C-terminal fragments of APP) levels either in HEK293APP cells (Supplementary Fig. 2h,I; Supplementary Fig. 15) or in APP/PS1 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2j,k; Supplementary Fig. 15). Further, expression of PS1, PS2, nicastrin or presenilin enhancer 2, proteins known as the \u03b3-secretase components, was not changed by TRPC6 (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Figs 2l and 11). Consistently, the \u03b3-secretase activity determined by in vitro assay using the fluorogenic substrate was unchanged by TRPC6 (Fig. 2e). We also examined whether TRPC6 affected \u03b3-secretase cleavage of Notch by detecting Notch intracellular domain level generated from Notch\u0394E, an immediate substrate of \u03b3-secretase29. As shown in Fig. 2f,g and Supplementary Fig. 11, TRPC6 did not alter the Notch intracellular domain level, suggesting that TRPC6 did not inhibit \u03b3-secretase cleavage of Notch. We further examined the CTF1 and CTF2 levels of E-/N-Cadherin, known as the endogenous substrates of \u03b3-secretase. As shown in Fig. 2h,i and Supplementary Fig. 11, TRPC6 did not alter the CTF2/CTF1 ratio of E-/N-Cadherin, suggesting that TRPC6 did not inhibit \u03b3-secretase cleavage of E-/N-Cadherin. Together, these results suggest that TRPC6 specifically reduces \u03b3-secretase cleavage of C99, but does not act as a general \u03b3-secretase inhibitor.",
                        "Certain proteins can interact with APP (C99) to regulate A\u03b2 production30. We next studied whether TRPC6 and APP (C99) were subcellularly co-localized. As the anti-TRPC6 antibody on hand cannot be used for immunostaining, we transfected HEK293 cell with TRPC6-HA and APP-Myc (C99-Myc) and stained with antibodies against HA- and Myc-tag. We found that TRPC6 and APP (C99) might co-localize in certain organelles (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 3a). These results provide the anatomic evidence to support the possible interaction between TRPC6 and APP. Next, in the fractionation experiments with mouse brain lysates, endogenous TRPC6 and APP (CTF) were also found in the same fractions (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 12). We then explored whether TRPC6 and APP were in the same complexes. Immunoprecipitation of mouse brain lysates, HEK293 cell or cortical neuronal lysates by APP antibody revealed that TRPC6 was in the precipitated complexes (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figs 3b,c, 13 and 16). In contrast, TRPC6 was not found in the complexes precipitated by PS1, Notch or APLP2 antibody (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figs 3b\u2013f, 13, 16 and 17), suggesting that TRPC6 selectively interacted with APP, but not with PS1, Notch or APLP2. Similarly, TRPC6 was found in the complexes precipitated by APP antibody in HEK293APP cells overexpressing TRPC6 (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 13), and the precipitated TRPC6 level was increased when its expression was enhanced (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b; Supplementary Fig. 17). In addition, TRPC6 was found in the complexes precipitated by APP antibody in HEK293TRPC6 cells overexpressing APP-I716F or APP-V717F, two familial AD-linked APP variants around \u03b3-secretase cleavage sites (Supplementary Figs 4c\u2013f and 17). In contrast, TRPC5 was not precipitated by APP antibody in HEK293APP cells overexpressing TRPC5 (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 13). Moreover, TRPC6, but not TRPC5, and C99 were found in the complexes by reciprocal precipitation experiments in HEK293C99 cells (Supplementary Figs 4g and 17). In addition, Notch\u0394E was not found in the complexes precipitated by TRPC6 antibody (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Fig. 14). All together, these results point to a possibility that TRPC6 selectively interacts with APP (C99) to specifically suppress its cleavage by \u03b3-secretase.",
                        "We next explored whether TRPC6 affected the interaction between C99 and PS1. The C99-Myc and PS1-HA in HEK293C99 cells were found in the complexes precipitated with the antibody against HA- or Myc-tag reciprocally (Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 14). However, the reciprocal precipitation of C99 and PS1 was markedly inhibited when TRPC6 was expressed (Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 14). It has been reported that PS2 can affect TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells13. We next explored whether APP could regulate the activity of TRPC6. Application of hyperforin, an agonist of TRPC6 (refs 18, 31), induced Ca2+ influx in HEK293TRPC6 cells and this Ca2+ entry was not affected by APP (Supplementary Fig. 4h,i). Together, these results suggest that TRPC6 prevents APP (C99) interaction with PS1 and APP does not affect the channel activity of TRPC6."

                        "To provide direct evidence that TRPC6 interaction with APP indeed inhibited APP cleavage by \u03b3-secretase and A\u03b2 formation, we investigated which domain of TRPC6 mediated its inhibitory effect on A\u03b2 production. TRPC6 has six transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminals (Supplementary Fig. 5a). As the cytoplasmic tail of C99 was reported to interact with several cytosolic proteins and these interactions may regulate A\u03b2 production30, we first hypothesized that cytoplasmic terminals of TRPC6 might interact with the cytoplasmic domain of C99 to reduce A\u03b2 production. We transfected HEK293APP cells with the N or C terminus (1\u2013405 or 725\u2013930 aa (amino acids)) of TRPC6 and examined A\u03b2 levels. These constructs did not affect A\u03b2 generation (Supplementary Fig. 5b). After a series of truncation experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5c), we found that all the constructs containing 437\u2013508 aa of TRPC6 reduced A\u03b2 levels, whereas the constructs without this domain did not (Supplementary Fig. 5d), suggesting that 437\u2013508 aa of TRPC6 was important for its inhibition of A\u03b2 production. This domain contains the first and second transmembrane regions and the first extracellular loop. When the second transmembrane (TM2) region was mutated, by point mutation (C6-mut1 and C6-mut2, Supplementary Fig. 5e), replacement (C6-mut3) or reversal (C6-mut4), TRPC6 was not able to reduce A\u03b2 levels (Fig. 4a), indicating that the TM2 domain was essential for TRPC6 to regulate A\u03b2 generation. Immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that C6-mut1 was not in the complexes precipitated by APP antibody (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting that TRPC6 may interact with APP through TM2 domain to inhibit A\u03b2 formation. To rule out the possibility that mutation of TRPC6 might affect its subcellular localization, we transfected HEK293 cell with C6-mut1-HA (Supplementary Fig. 5e) and APP-Myc, and stained with HA and Myc antibodies. The C6-mut1 and APP might co-localize in certain organelles (Supplementary Fig. 5f), similar to wild-type (WT) TRPC6 and APP (Fig. 3a)."

                        "To mimic TRPC6 inhibition of A\u03b2 formation, a cell-permeable peptide TAT-TM2 containing the 487\u2013508 aa of TRPC6 was synthesized and TAT-TM2, but not its mutated form (TAT-TM2-mut1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 6a) or TAT-TM1, greatly suppressed A\u03b2 production in HEK293APP cells (Fig. 4c). Further, TAT-TM2 dose-dependently reduced A\u03b2 levels in HEK293APP cells and in the primary cultured cortical neurons (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). To determine the amino acids important for the inhibitory effect, TAT-TM2-N (N-terminal 10 aa of TM2 fused to TAT) and TAT-TM2-C (C-terminal 11 aa of TM2 fused to TAT) were synthesized. The TAT-TM2-C inhibited A\u03b2 generation, whereas TAT-TM2-N did not (Supplementary Fig. 6d), suggesting that the C-terminal 11 aa of TM2 was critical for reducing A\u03b2 formation. Indeed, mutations within this domain blocked the effect of TAT-TM2-C on reducing A\u03b2 levels (Supplementary Fig. 6e). In the experiment to test whether TAT-TM2 also binds to APP, we found that TAT-TM2-biotin, but not TAT-biotin, interacted with APP similar to the full-length TRPC6 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 14), whereas it did not bind to TRPC6 (Supplementary Figs 7a and 18). Addition of TAT-TM2 prevented the interaction between APP and TAT-TM2-biotin or TRPC6 (Supplementary Figs 7b\u2013e and 18). Further, assayed by a double-blinded manner, injection of TAT-TM2 into APP/PS1 mice led to a marked reduction in A\u03b2 levels in the mouse brain (Fig. 4e). All these results show that TAT-TM2 reduces A\u03b2 accumulation in cultures and in mice.",
                        "To show whether TAT-TM2 can prevent \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP (C99), we carried out the in vitro purified C99 cleavage assay. TAT-TM2, but not its mutated forms (TAT-TM2-mut1, 2) or TAT-TM1, inhibited A\u03b2 generation (Fig. 4f). Further, TAT-TM2 dose-dependently reduced A\u03b2 levels in the in vitro C99 cleavage assay (Supplementary Figs 6f, 7f,g and 18). The A\u03b2 production in COS7 cells stably expressing C99 and the AICD generation from HEK293C99 cell, all were suppressed when TAT-TM2 was applied (Fig. 4g\u2013i; Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting that TAT-TM2 prevented \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP (C99). However, TAT-TM2 did not affect Notch cleavage by \u03b3-secretase (Fig. 4h,i; Supplementary Fig. 14). Together, these results suggest that TAT-TM2 reduces A\u03b2 levels without effect on \u03b3-secretase cleavage of Notch."

Amyloid plaques were examined by A\u03b2 immunostaining with 6E10 antibody on the brain sections of APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 8a). The plaque load was markedly reduced in APP/PS1/TRPC6 male (Supplementary Fig. 8b) and female (Fig. 5b) mice compared with that in APP/PS1 mice. Plaque staining with A\u03b2 specific antibody MOAB-2 (ref. 33) confirmed that the plaque load was greatly reduced in APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice compared with that in APP/PS1 mice (Supplementary Fig. 8f\u2013i). Total A\u03b2 levels in guanidine-HCl (GuHCl) extraction of APP/PS1/TRPC6 male (Supplementary Fig. 8c) and female (Fig. 5c) mouse forebrains were greatly reduced than those of APP/PS1 mouse forebrains. The TBST soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 levels in APP/PS1/TRPC6 male (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e) and female (Fig. 5d,e) mice were also substantially reduced compared with those in APP/PS1 mice. To further confirm the effect of TRPC6, we examined whether TRPC6 could reduce amyloid plaque in APP/PS1 mice with another genetic background. The plaque load in the hippocampus of APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice in B6C3 background stained with thioflavin S (Fig. 5f) was also greatly reduced than that in APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 5g). Taken together, TRPC6 reduces A\u03b2 accumulation in APP/PS1 mice.",
                        "As synapse loss was found to be best correlated with dementia degree1415 and A\u03b2 was proposed to be responsible for the synapse loss and dementia, we next asked whether reduced A\u03b2 levels by TRPC6 could improve AD pathology. At 6 months, the spine density, an indicator to evaluate synapse numbers revealed by Golgi staining, of TRPC6 mouse hippocampus was higher than that of WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013c). But at 11 month the spine density between TRPC6 mice and WT mice was likely similar (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The spine density of APP/PS1 mice either at 6 or 11 months was greatly reduced than that of WT mice, whereas it was markedly increased in APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice than that in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that TRPC6 prevented the spine loss in APP/PS1 mice. In the behavioural test, we found that at 6 months, TRPC6 mice performed better than WT mice both in the training and probe session of Morris Water Maze (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e), while at 11 months, there was no difference in the performance between TRPC6 and WT mice (Fig. 6d,e). However, compared with APP/PS1 mice, APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice spent shorter time to find the hidden platform in training session at 11 months (Fig. 6d), and crossed the platform region more times in the probe test at 6 months (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Therefore, overexpression of TRPC6 in neurons improves learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice. All these results are consistent with an explanation that TRPC6 downregulates A\u03b2 levels to maintain the structural and behavioural plasticity of AD mouse brains."

                "In this study we reported that TRPC6 could function as a novel endogenous \u03b3-secretase modulator and specifically regulate A\u03b2 production. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, TRPC6 inhibited \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP without effect on \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP, A\u03b2 clearance or \u03b3-secretase cleavage of other substrates tested (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs 2, 11 and 15). Second, TRPC6 selectively interacted with APP (C99), but not with Notch (Fig. 3c,e; Supplementary Figs 3b,c,13,14 and 16). Third, the fusion peptide TAT-TM2 prevented \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP, but not that of Notch (Fig. 4h,I; Supplementary Fig. 14). Finally, elevating TRPC6 in the forebrain neurons reduced A\u03b2 levels and improved structural and behavioural plasticity of APP/PS1 mice (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Thus, affecting TRPC6 levels may be a new strategy to specifically inhibit \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP and reduce A\u03b2 production.",
                "Several compounds have been developed to target \u03b3-secretase, but they were not successful in clinical trials to treat AD patients534. Although different reasons may have contributed to the failures, the unwanted side effects due to the strong inhibition of \u03b3-secretase by the compounds prevent clinical use of these agents. Therefore, the search for a specific modulation of \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP without affecting other substrates, including Notch7, is urgently needed. Several proteins, including GPR3 (ref. 35), Aph1B/C36, GSK3\u03b1 (ref. 37), CK1 (ref. 38) and DOR39, have been reported to specifically enhance \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP to promote A\u03b2 generation. However, proteins which can specifically downregulate A\u03b2 production are less reported. It has been shown that downregulation of TMP21, reported as a \u03b3-secretase component, increases A\u03b2 levels without effect on cleavage of Notch40. However, elevating TMP21 expression in cells could not reduce A\u03b2 levels40, and overexpressing TMP21 in mice causes post-natal growth retardation, severe neurological problems and premature death41. Here, we report that TRPC6 interaction with APP leads to the specific reduction in A\u03b2 production and improvement in structural and behavioural plasticity in APP/PS1/TRPC6 mice. It is thus likely that the substrate selectivity of \u03b3-secretase could be finely regulated by additional proteins, such as TRPC6, to confer the selective modulation of A\u03b2 production.",
                "While a few proteins have been found to regulate the substrate selectivity of \u03b3-secretase, the mechanism remains largely unknown. Recently, \u03b3-secretase-activating protein (GSAP) was reported to increase \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP (C99) and A\u03b2 generation, whereas Notch cleavage was not influenced42. It has been shown that GSAP could specifically interact with C99, but not with Notch, an observation similar to TRPC6 reported here (Fig. 3c,e; Supplementary Figs 3b,c, 13, 14 and 16). Thus, selective substrate targeting by interaction may confer a specific modulation of \u03b3-secretase cleavage. Actually, it has been reported that small-molecule \u03b3-secretase modulators, which regulate \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP, but not that of Notch, bind to C99 with a high affinity, but to Notch with a much lower affinity43. However, different from GSAP, which also binds to PS1, TRPC6 does not interact with PS1. Several other proteins have been reported to interact with PS1 to modulate \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP363940. In this context, the APP-specific interaction of TRPC6 to regulate A\u03b2 generation may basically minimize the risk of inhibiting \u03b3-secretase to avoid unexpected side effects, a critical problem encountered in clinical trials.",
                "The TRPC channels are nonselective cation channels which play important roles in development10 and diseases1112. To date all the reported functions of TRPC6 channels require its channel activities. Here, we reported that TRPC6 inhibited \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP likely through protein\u2013protein interaction, but not requiring its channel activity. Actually, Cav1.2, an L-type Ca2+ channel protein, has been reported to regulate transcription of certain genes independent of its channel activity, but through the C-terminal fragment44. TRPM6 and TRPM7, two channel proteins with kinase activity, have been found to phosphorylate myosin IIA and annexin I through their kinase domains45. In addition, TRPC1 could promote neurite outgrowth independent of its channel activity46. Thus, TRPC6 is a new channel protein to exert cellular functions independent of its channel activity. It is not clear for now whether TRPC6 interaction with APP is regulated. Since downregulation of TRPC6 and DN-TRPC6, all affect A\u03b2 production, the level of TRPC6 is critical for its modulation of A\u03b2 production. Therefore, it will be informative to examine the expression levels of TRPC6 in AD patients.",
                "In conclusion, our results showed that TRPC6 regulated A\u03b2 levels independent of its channel activity. TRPC6 inhibited \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP, but not that of Notch, through its selective interaction with APP. These results suggest that preventing APP interaction with PS1 via TRPC6 could be a novel strategy to reduce A\u03b2 formation and reveal a novel cellular function of TRPC6. Finding molecule(s) functioning as TAT-TM2, which is able to reduce A\u03b2 production without affecting Notch cleavage, may provide novel intervention candidates to reduce A\u03b2 levels and treat AD patients while bypassing the side effects induced by the direct inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity."
