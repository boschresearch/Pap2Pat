# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- introduce Alzheimer's disease and its diagnosis

## BACKGROUND

- describe current understanding of Alzheimer's disease

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- provide biomarker for early AD prediction or diagnosis
- provide therapeutic agent for AD treatment or prevention
- describe use of TRPC6 gene and/or protein for AD prediction or diagnosis
- describe use of TRPC6 protein or derivatives for AD treatment or prevention

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- introduce TRPC6 and its role in AD
- describe TRPC6 mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells
- discuss TRPC6 protein structure and function
- explain the use of TRPC6 for AD prediction or diagnosis
- describe TRPC6 mutant or active fragment containing 487-507aa
- discuss APOE gene and its role in AD
- outline pharmaceutical composition and therapeutic use of TRPC6
- describe medication screening method based on TRPC6
- highlight advantages of the present invention
- provide general methods for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time fluorogenic quantitative PCR
- describe additional experimental methods for protein extraction, Western blot examination, and immunohistochemistry

### EXAMPLE 1

- compare TRPC6 mRNA levels in peripheral blood cells
- correlate TRPC6 mRNA levels with AD diagnosis and dementia degree

### EXAMPLE 2

- determine relevance between TRPC6 mRNA level and Aβ in cell and in vivo

### EXAMPLE 3

- determine effect of expressing TRPCs on Aβ in cells and in vivo

### EXAMPLE 4

- examine effect of TRPC6 on γ-secretase cleavage of its substrates

### EXAMPLE 5

- screen and target transmembrane polypeptide of TRPC6 responsible for its active effect

### EXAMPLE 6

- synthesize fusion peptide containing 487-507aa and detect thereof

### EXAMPLE 7

- screen compounds for prevention or treatment of AD by improving TRPC6 expression

### EXAMPLE 8

- determine correlation between APOE genotype and TRPC6 mRNA levels

### EXAMPLE 9

- determine effect of TAT-TM2 on γ-secretase cleavage of the substrate thereof
