# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to methods of treating a subject suffering from an ischemic condition and of preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury in a subject suffering from an ischemic condition. The ischemic condition is especially but not exclusively ischemic heart disease and the subject is a human. The methods comprise administering an effective amount of a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng to the subject. The carbohydrate composition in particular comprises at least one polysaccharide which is an acidic heteroglycan. The present invention further provides a method of protecting cells against hypoxia and reoxygenation induced cell death, a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng and the method for its preparation and a pharmaceutical formulation comprising it.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Ischemic conditions, in particular ischemic heart disease (IHD), represent a leading cause of human death. Data issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014 indicate that about 7.4 million people died due to ischemic heart disease in 2012 which makes IHD to the no. 1 in the list of life-threatening conditions. At present, the approach for curing IHD is to re-perfuse the affected area through Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (GABG) or Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI). However, if reperfusion is delayed, this may exacerbate the myocardial injury known as ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.

Available medical therapies such as calcium channel blockers most often fail to provide sufficient therapeutic efficacy and may even enhance the risk of heart attacks. Further, the mechanisms of IHD are quite complex. How to increase the effectiveness of the treatment is, thus, of significant importance. Accordingly, there remains a strong need for further treatment options in treating ischemic conditions like IHD in particular for those which are able to protect against hypoxia and reoxygenation induced cell death.

Recently, Traditional Chinese medicine as well as complementary and alternative medicine has getting popular. Traditional Chinese medicines based on plant materials as well as respective components gained from plants usually allow for treatment of various diseases and conditions while bearing a reduced risk for side effects. In view of the rich medicinal plant resources, respective medicines can usually be produced in a cost-effective way. Accordingly, there has been a lot of research with regard to plants and respective ingredients for treatment of several conditions.

Traditional Chinese medicine is usually characterized by multiple components targeting multiple pathways at multiple levels to produce synergistic effects and, thus, might be a valuable treatment option for IHD, too. For example, Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (ginseng) has been used as a classic traditional Chinese medicine quite for a long time, wherein the whole ginseng extract was assumed to have cardio-protective effects (Zheng, S.-D. et al., Chinese journal of integrative medicine 18, 548-555, 2012). However, it seems that ginsenosides might only partially contribute to said effects (Zhou, H. et al., J Ethnopharmacol 135, 287-298, 2011).

Since diversified components in Chinese herbal medicines often act via multiple modes, there is a strong need for identifying and providing components in a rather isolated form with sufficient therapeutic efficiency, in particular suitable for treatment of ischemic conditions. Having those active ingredients could further reduce the risk of side effects or interactions which might limit the therapeutic use due to the presence of further ingredients with reduced or insufficient efficacy for treating the respective disease.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The first aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a subject suffering from an ischemic condition and a method of preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury in a subject suffering from an ischemic condition, which ischemic condition is in particular ischemic heart disease.

Said methods comprise administering an effective amount of a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng to the subject, in particular a human.

The carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng comprises a carbohydrate portion, preferably formed by at least one polysaccharide, with an amount of more than 50% by weight based on the weight of the carbohydrate composition. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the carbohydrate portion comprises and in particular essentially consists of at least one polysaccharide which is an acidic heteroglycan. Further preferably, the carbohydrate composition comprises at least 85% by weight of the polysaccharide based on the weight of the carbohydrate composition. In particular, glucose and galactose are the main monosaccharides forming the at least one polysaccharide.

The carbohydrate composition is in particular extracted from Panax ginseng with an extraction comprising steps of:

(i) providing a crude Panax ginseng extract comprising contacting Panax ginseng plant material with an extraction solvent comprising an aliphatic alcohol; and

(ii) isolating the carbohydrate composition from the crude Panax ginseng extract of step (i).

The crude Panax ginseng extract obtained in step (i) is in particular a standardized Panax ginseng extract, i.e. is standardized to contain a predetermined amount of ginsenosides, most preferably Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rb2 and Rd with amounts of about 8.08 mg/g, about 7.64 mg/g, about 11.58 mg/g, about 10.35 mg/g, about 6.67 mg/g and about 4.50 mg/g, respectively.

Step (ii) in particular comprises steps of:

a) optionally fractionating the crude Panax ginseng extract for obtaining a carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract in particular comprising subjecting the crude Panax ginseng extract to a fluid-fluid chromatography preferably carried out as a high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC);

b) adding water and an aliphatic alcohol, in particular ethanol, to the crude Panax ginseng extract of step (i) or to the carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract of step a) for obtaining a carbohydrate-enriched precipitate;

c) subjecting the carbohydrate-enriched precipitate to an anion-exchange chromatography with an eluting solvent, in particular comprising water and sodium chloride, for obtaining an eluate comprising the carbohydrate composition;

d) concentrating the eluate of step c) for obtaining the carbohydrate composition in particular including freeze-drying.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of protecting cells against hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) induced cell death. The method comprises contacting the cells with a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng, in particular with between 6.25 μg/ml and 800 μg/ml of the carbohydrate composition for at least 24 h. The cells are in particular cardiomyocytes, i.e. from the cardiac muscle.

Further provided is a method for preparing a carbohydrate composition by extracting the carbohydrate composition from Panax ginseng as described above.

The present invention further refers to the carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng, in particular comprising at least one polysaccharide which is an acidic heteroglycan.

The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an effective amount of the carbohydrate composition described above and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as selected from a diluent, a filler, a binder, a disintegrant, a lubricant, a coloring agent, a surfactant or a preservative.

The invention is also the carbohydrate composition described above for use as a medicament for the treatment of an ischemic condition and/or for preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury in a subject suffering from an ischemic condition, in particular ischemic heart disease. Another aspect of the invention refers to the use of the carbohydrate composition described above for preparing a medicament for treatment of an ischemic condition and/or for preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury in a subject suffering from an ischemic condition, in particular ischemic heart disease. The present invention also relates to the use of the carbohydrate composition as described above for protecting cells against hypoxia and reoxygenation induced cell death.

The carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng proved to exceptionally increase cell viability and reduce apoptosis rate under hypoxia and reoxygenation conditions. In particular, the carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng according to the present invention proved to prevent morphological changes of cells, to protect the mitochondrial function such as by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, to increase the ATP level, to increase the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and to activate the pro-survival Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) Pathway.

In particular, a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng comprising an acidic heteroglycan with a carbohydrate content of about 90.28% by weight comprising glucose with about 76.31% by weight, galactose about 12.70% by weight, galacturonic acid about 5.64% by weight, arabinose about 3.72% by weight, and glucuronic acid about 1.64% by weight and with a total protein content of about 9.85% by weight and an apparent molecular weight of about 3.8×104 Da demonstrated an exceptionally high potency in protecting cardiomyocytes against hypoxia and reoxygenation induced cell death. The experiments confirmed that said carbohydrate composition in particular increased the protein level of the steroid hormone receptors GR and ER and the phosphorylated expression of PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2 and eNOS, and NO production in a dose dependent manner. The inventors assume that it protects cardiomyocytes from H/R induced cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bcl2/Bax and by inhibiting the activities of caspase-3/7 and -9. It significantly stimulated cellular energy metabolisms and proved to suppress H/R induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the cardiomyocytes, too.

The results confirm for the first time that a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng has an exceptional cardio-protective effect which is expected to follow from the regulation of the mitochondrial metabolism and RISK pathway, in particular its cardio-protective potential exceeds the cardio-protective potential of the crude or total Panax ginseng extract. In other words, the inventors unexpectedly found that a total ginseng extract is less potent than the carbohydrate composition, in particular polysaccharides, obtainable from said total extract. The carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng, thus, provides a highly advantageous and highly promising treatment option for cardio-protection and treatment of IHD.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described. The invention includes all such variations and modifications. The invention also includes all steps and features referred to or indicated in the specification, individually or collectively, and any and all combinations of the steps or features.

Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Unless otherwise defined, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one skilled in the art to which the invention belongs.

As used herein, “comprising” means including the following elements but not excluding others. “Essentially consisting of” means that the material consists of the respective element along with usually and unavoidable impurities such as side products and components usually resulting from the respective preparation or method for obtaining the material such as traces of further components or solvents. “Consisting of” means that the material solely consists of, i.e. is formed by the respective element. As used herein, the forms “a,” “an,” and “the,” are intended to include the singular and plural forms unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The present invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from an ischemic condition. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury in a subject suffering from an ischemic condition.

The term “ischemic condition” as used herein refers to an inadequate or stopped flow and supply, respectively, of blood and oxygen to a part of the body, in particular to an organ and/or tissue caused by constriction or blockage of the blood vessels supplying it with blood such as due to a surgery, an injury or atherosclerotic stenosis, thrombosis, embolism, thromboembolism, or stroke or the like. In particular, the organ is the heart or the tissue is part of the heart, i.e. the ischemic condition preferably refers to an inadequate or stopped flow and supply, respectively, of blood and oxygen to the heart or parts thereof such as to the heart muscle or parts thereof, i.e. the ischemic condition is preferably an ischemic condition affecting the heart.

The ischemic condition is more preferably ischemic heart disease (IHD), also known as coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease, usually caused by a constriction or blockage of the coronary arteries resulting in a reduced blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle or parts thereof.

The term “ischemia-reperfusion injury” refers to the cellular damage after reperfusion of previously ischemic organs or tissues, i.e. when blood and oxygen supply returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia. More specifically, the restoration of blood flow after an ischemic condition can actually be more damaging than the ischemic condition itself. The so called ischemia-reperfusion injury can result in acceleration of cell death. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood creates a condition in which the restoration of blood supply results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress leading to the ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Said methods of the present invention comprise administering an effective amount of a carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng to the subject.

The subject can be an animal or a human. Preferably, the subject is a mammal, in particular the subject is a human.

The term “carbohydrate composition” as used herein means a composition comprising significant amounts, in particular more than 50% by weight, of carbohydrates, in particular polysaccharides, and more preferably more than 70% by weight and especially preferably more than 80% by weight and most preferably more than 85% by weight or even at least 90% by weight of carbohydrates. The total amount of carbohydrates is also referenced herein as the “carbohydrate portion” of the carbohydrate composition. I.e. the carbohydrate composition extracted from Panax ginseng comprises a carbohydrate portion, preferably formed by at least one polysaccharide, with an amount of more than 50% by weight, preferably more than 70% by weight and more preferably more than 80% by weight and most preferably more than 85% by weight or even at least 90% by weight based on the weight of the carbohydrate composition.

The term “carbohydrates” as used herein comprises monosaccharides including functionally modified monosaccharides, i.e. monosaccharides carrying functional groups like carboxyl groups, ester groups or amino groups, as well as polysaccharides formed by the monosaccharides and/or functionally modified monosaccharides. Polysaccharides as used herein are polymeric carbohydrates composed of two or more monosaccharides and/or functionally modified monosaccharides which are bound together usually by glycosidic linkage. A polysaccharide might further contain amino acids or polypeptides linking such as cross-linking components of the polysaccharide. This is still referred to as one polysaccharide according to this invention, wherein the linking such as cross-linking amino acids/polypeptides form the protein portion and the monosaccharides and polysaccharide components linked such as cross-linked by the amino acids/polypeptides form part of the carbohydrate portion of the carbohydrate composition.

The monosaccharides of a polysaccharide can be identical in which case the polysaccharide is referenced as a homopolysaccharide or homoglycan. If more than one type of monosaccharide is present in the polysaccharide, such polysaccharide is referenced as heteropolysaccharide or heteroglycan. A polysaccharide can, for example, be basic, neutral or acidic depending on the functional groups the monosaccharides of the polysaccharide carry. Acidic polysaccharides are generally polysaccharides that comprise monosaccharides carrying functional groups which can release protons such as carboxyl groups, phosphate groups and/or sulfate groups. Basic polysaccharides can be proton acceptors due to functional groups of monosaccharides such as amino groups.

In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the carbohydrate composition comprises at least one polysaccharide. The polysaccharide is most preferably an acidic heteroglycan. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the carbohydrate portion of the carbohydrate composition comprises a polysaccharide which is an acidic heteroglycan, herein said carbohydrate portion amounts to more than 85% by weight and in particular at least 90% by weight of the carbohydrate composition.

The carbohydrate composition can be administered in combination with other therapeutic compounds, preferably therapeutic compounds used for treating ischemic conditions, in particular used for treating ischemic heart disease such as for preventing an ischemia-reperfusion injury.

By “effective amount” is meant the safe and efficacious amount required to therapeutically treat or ameliorate a condition, such as an ischemic condition or an ischemia-reperfusion injury, i.e. to treat the condition in a clinically relevant manner. The effective amount may vary depending upon the subject, the kind of administration, age, and general health of the subject and can be determined by standard procedures such as with cell cultures or experimental animals. A concentration of the carbohydrate composition may, for example, be between 1 μg/ml and 800 μg/ml, such as between 6.25 μg/ml and 800 μg/ml and in particular of from about 50 μg/ml to about 200 μg/ml, most preferably about 200 μg/ml.

The carbohydrate composition can be administered to the subject alone or as part of a pharmaceutical formulation which further comprises at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and may additionally contain at least one further therapeutic compound, in particular a therapeutic compound for treating ischemic conditions such as ischemic heart disease.

The skilled person is able to select suitable excipients depending on the form of the pharmaceutical formulation and is aware of methods for manufacturing pharmaceutical formulations as well as able to select a suitable method for preparing the pharmaceutical formulation depending on the kind of excipients and the form of the pharmaceutical formulation.

When the separation time ran to 100 min, the mobile phase is preferably changed to the lower phase of ethyl acetate-water (1:1). Fractions are preferably collected in 5 min intervals.

Fractions with an increased amount of carbohydrates according to a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis are preferably combined further referenced as carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract which may be concentrated by means of drying such as freeze-drying. The thin-layer chromatography is preferably carried out with silica gel, in particular silica gel 60, developed with chloroform/methanol/water (13:7:2) and detected under UV-254 nm. The presence of carbohydrates can be verified with usual and well-known reagents such as p-anisidine hydrochloride, naphthoresorcinol with acid or silver nitrate with base. In particular preferred embodiments of the present invention, the carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract is obtained by drying such as freeze-drying combined fractions comprising an increased amount of carbohydrates.

The aliphatic alcohol used in step b) is an aliphatic hydrocarbon, preferably a branched or straight chain alkane, wherein at least one hydrogen atom of the aliphatic hydrocarbon is substituted with a hydroxyl group, preferably one hydrogen atom is substituted with a hydroxyl group referenced as monohydric aliphatic alcohol. More preferably, the aliphatic alcohol is a monohydric aliphatic alcohol, still more preferably a monohydric alcohol with 1 to 3 carbon atoms. I.e. the aliphatic alcohol is more preferably selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol or mixtures thereof. More preferably, the aliphatic alcohol is ethanol. The amount of water and aliphatic alcohol, in particular ethanol, can be selected such that a mixture with 70 Vol.-% to 90 Vol.-%, in particular about 70 Vol.-% aliphatic alcohol in water is obtained. Preferably, the crude Panax ginseng extract of step (i) or the carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract of step a) is dissolved in water and then the aliphatic alcohol optionally with water is added for obtaining a concentration of 70 Vol.-% to 90 Vol.-% aliphatic alcohol in water, in particular about 70 Vol.-% aliphatic alcohol in water.

Apoptosis can be determined by means of flow cytometry/Annexin V assay.

Contacting the cells, in particular cardiomyocytes, with the carbohydrate composition in particular has at least one of the following effects: prevents morphological changes of the cells, protects the mitochondrial function such as by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, increases the ATP level, increases the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and activates the pro-survival Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) Pathway. This can be determined such as by measuring the levels of Erk1/2/phospho-Erk1/2, PI3K/phospho-PI3K, Akt/phospho-Akt, and/or eNOS/phosphor-eNOS such as by means of Western Blotting.

### Example 1

Extraction of a Carbohydrate Composition of the Present Invention

**Example 1A**

Provision of the crude Panax ginseng extract (hereinafter referenced as “RSE”) Panax ginseng was authenticated, and its quality conformed to the requirements of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Edition 2015) and Hong Kong Standard of Chinese Materia Medica. The sample was stored in a desiccated condition in the laboratory until use. Voucher specimens in the form of whole root were deposited in the State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine (Macau University of Science and Technology). The standardized ginseng extract (RSE) was first prepared from P. ginseng by extraction for 2 h with 5 volumes (vs. Panax ginseng weight) of 70% ethanol for three times, a known method for preparing ginseng extract. The ethanol extracts were pooled and concentrated and finally dried to powder (RSE) under low temperature. The extraction rate reached at around 28%, meaning that 1 kg P. ginseng produced 280 g of RSE. The chemical fingerprints of RSE were established by using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometer (HPLC-TOF-MS), which led to the identification and quantification of eleven ginsenosides in conjunction with the use of chemical standards of ginsenosides (HPLC purity >98%) purchased from Chengdu Scholar Bio-Tech Co. Ltd. (Chengdu, China) or National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China). The contents of ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd, were 8.08, 7.64, 11.58, 10.35, 6.67, and 4.50 mg/g, respectively (Zhou, H. et al., J Ethnopharmacol 135, 287-298, 2011).

**Example 1B**

Isolation of the Carbohydrate Composition from the Crude Panax ginseng Extract

Fractionating the Crude Panax ginseng Extract by Means of High-Speed Counter-Current Chromatography

The crude Panax ginseng extract (RSE) was fractionated using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) first. The HSCCC instrument used in this study was a TBE-1000A HSCCC system (Tauto Biotechnique Company, Shanghai, China) equipped with a three polytetrafluoroethylene coil with 1000 mL total capacity. The β value of the column from internal layer to external layer varied from 0.59 to 0.75. A Waters (Waters Corp., MA, USA) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was connected to the HSCCC instrument. HPLC was equipped with Waters 2425 pump, Waters 2489UV detector, Waters FlexInject injector and Waters Fraction Collector III collector. The diphase solvent systems were prepared by adding the solvents to a separation funnel according to the volume ratios and fully equilibrated by shaking repeatedly at room temperature. The upper and lower phases were separated, degassed by sonication, and settled over night before use. The RSE extract (4.12 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of a two-phase solvent, then centrifuged with a Centrifuge 5810 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 4000 rpm for 15 min to get the supernatant solution. Firstly, the HSCCC column was filled with the stationary phase (the upper layer of butanol-water at a ratio of 1:1), then the apparatus was rotated in “forward” direction at 800 rpm and the sample solution was injected into the column through the injection loop. After that, the lower phase of butanol-water (1:1) was pumped into the column in a “head to tail” mode at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. When the separation time ran to 100 min, the mobile phase was changed to lower phase of ethyl acetate-water (1:1). The effluent was collected by every 5 min. The fractions were combined according to the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, and then freeze-dried. TLC was developed with chloroform/methanol/water (13:7:2) and detected under UV-254 nm. CA, USA).

Stepwise Ethanol Precipitation for Obtaining a Carbohydrate-Enriched Precipitate

HSCCC fractions were screened for their bioactivities. The carbohydrate-enriched HSCCC fractions, i.e. the carbohydrate-enriched Panax ginseng extract was dissolved in water and carbohydrate-enriched precipitates were obtained using stepwise precipitation in 90%, 80% and 70% of ethanol solutions in turns. Supernatants and precipitates were collected via centrifugation and freeze dying.

Subjecting the Carbohydrate-Enriched Precipitates to an Anion-Exchange Chromatography with H2O, H2O/NaCl or NaOH and Concentrating the Eluate Fractions

The carbohydrate-enriched precipitates and supernatants were further screened for their bioactivities and the carbohydrate-enriched precipitates were subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on Toyopearl DEAE 650 M that was stepwise eluted with H2O, 0.5 M of NaCl, 1.0 M of NaCl, 2.0 M of NaCl and 0.2 M of NaOH to give 5 eluate fractions. These five eluate fractions were collected via dialysis (Wako, Osaka, JAPAN), centrifugation, and lyophilization, and represent carbohydrate compositions of the present invention named NP, AP1, AP2, AP3, and AP4, respectively.

**Example 1C**

Isolation of the Carbohydrate Composition from the Crude Panax ginseng Extract without a Step of Fractionating the Crude Panax ginseng Extract

Crude Panax ginseng extract (RSE) was dissolved in water and the solution was added with ethanol to make a 70% ethanol solution and then filtered 24 h later. The carbohydrate-enriched precipitate was collected and dissolved in water to make the water solution of the carbohydrate-enriched precipitate. The water solution of the carbohydrate-enriched precipitate was loaded onto DEAE-650 M column chromatography that was eluted with water and 0.5 M NaCl. The 0.5 M NaCl elution was condensed under reduced pressure, and the condensed solution was dialyzed against 1,000 Da sieve in water for 24 hours. The dialyzed solution was collected and freeze-dried it to obtain the carbohydrate composition referenced herein as AP1.

### Example 2

Chemical and Pharmacological Characterization

**Example 2A**

Chemical characterization of the carbohydrate compositions of example 1 Examination by high-performance gel filtration chromatography (HPGPC) The apparent molecular weights of carbohydrate compositions were determined on Agilent 1100 system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.) equipped with a Alltech 2000 evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD), and on two TSK GMPWXL gel filtration columns in series (7.8×300 mm×2) with column temperature maintained at 40° C. 20 mM CH3COONH4 was used as mobile phase at the flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The drift tube temperature of ELSD was set at 120° C., the nitrogen flow rate was set at 3.2 L/min and the gain number was set to 4. After filtration, 20 μL solution was injected for analysis. Commercially available T-series dextrans (MW 1, 5, 12, 25, 50, 80, 150, 270, 410, 670 kDa) were used as standard molecular markers.

Monosaccharide Composition Analysis

Carbohydrate compositions (5 mg) were hydrolyzed with 2 M TFA at 120° C. for 2 h in a sealed test tube. The acid was removed under reduced pressure by repeated evaporation with methanol. Then 1 mL water was added to dissolve the hydrolysate. After centrifugation (14,000, 10 min), the 100 μL supernatant was mixed with the same volume of NH3 solution and 200 μL 0.5 M PMP methanol solutions. The mixture was allowed to react at 70° C. for 30 min. After cooling, 100 μL glacial acetic acid and 500 μL chloroform were successively added to neutralize the reaction solution and to remove the excess PMP reagents. The organic phase was discarded after vigorous shaking. The operation was performed 4 times, and the aqueous layer was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter (Vertic Chromatography Co., Ltd., Bangkok, THAILAND) before LC-DAD analysis. The monosaccharide composition was analyzed by HPLC using the reported methods (Xu, J. et al., Anal Bioanal Chem 406, 6409-6417, 2014).

Chemical Analysis

Total sugar contents were determined by phenol-H2SO4 colorimetric method (Dubois, M. et al., Analytical chemistry 28, 350-356, 1956). Uronic acid contents were determined using m-hydroxydiphenyl method (Blumenkrantz, N. and Asboe-Hansen, G., Anal Biochem 54, 484-489, 1973). Protein content analysis was carried out using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit and BSA was used as the standard.

**Example 2B**

Pharmacological Characterization

The rat ventricular myocardial cell line H9c2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md., USA) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37° C. under normoxic condition (95% air/5% CO2). The medium was changed every two days, and the confluent cells were passaged by trypsinization weekly. The cells passaged for three to four times were used for experiments described as below.

Comparisons between different experimental groups were performed using one-way AVOVA and SNK post hoc test with Graph Pad Prism 6.0 software (Graph Pad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif., USA). The data were expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD). P values less than 0.05 were considered as significant.

All measurements were repeated in three wells, the results are the average of three independent experiments.

Cytotoxicity Test

To examine the myocardial cytotoxicity of AP1 on H9c2 cells under normoxic conditions, the cells were cultured in the absence or presence of AP1 at different concentrations (final concentrations range from 100 μg/mL to 1600 μg/mL).

Hypoxia/Reoxygenation

To examine the effectiveness of RSE and AP1 on H9c2 cells under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions, the cells were cultured under normoxic conditions (95% air/5% CO2) overnight; then the cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (composition in mM: NaCl 115, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 2.5, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, NaHCO3 24, HEPES 10; pH 7.4) balanced with N2 at 4° C. for overnight. Aliquots (100 μL) of KRB supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) BSA were added to the cells immediately prior to hypoxia. To create a hypoxia condition, a hypoxic chamber (Stem Cell Technologies, USA) was used to produce an in vitro hypoxia challenge (Chiu, P. Y. et al., Molecular and cellular biochemistry 350, 237-250, 2011). In essence, the cells were placed in the sealed chamber and the chamber was flushed with pure N2 for 5 min at a flow rate of 20 mL/min, then, all sealable connectors were closed. After that, the chamber was transferred to an incubator and the cells in the chamber were subjected to 3 h incubation at 37° C. to induced hypoxia. Reoxygenation was initiated by opening the chamber and then replacing the KRB with fresh DMEM medium, the cells were then cultured in an incubator under normoxic conditions (95% air/5% CO2) at 37° C. for another 4 h.

Drug Treatment

The cells were seeded at the density of 8×104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The final concentration in assays for the crude Panax ginseng extract and the HSCCC fractions was 200 μg/mL, based on that, RSE and its active component (final concentrations range from 6.25 to 800 μg/mL) were added to the culture system 1 h before hypoxia treatment and throughout the reoxygenation period. The control normal group was always maintained in normal DMEM and put in the incubator under normoxic atmosphere (95% air/5% CO2). For pharmaceutical blockages, the cells were treated with mifepristone (an inhibitor of GR, 100 μM), tamoxifen (an inhibitor of ER, 100 μM), L-NAME (an inhibitor of NOS, 10 μM), LY294002 (an inhibitor of PI3K, 40 μM), Akt inhibitor IV (an inhibitor of Akt protein kinase, 10 μM), U0126 (an inhibitor of Erk1/2, 40 μM) right before the pretreatment of AP1 (200 μg/mL). The selection of these inhibitors is based on literatures (Aguilar, D. C. et al., Cardiovasc Toxicol 13, 91-99, 2013, Guo, R. et al., Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry 32, 1668-1680, 2013, Wei, C. D. et al., Lipids Health Dis 11, 135, 2012, Diffley, J. M. et al., Molecular Vision 15, 135-145, 2009, Park, E. S. et al., J Ethnopharmacol 153, 552-560, 2014) and the dosages of these inhibitors were screened to ensure that the pretreatment of inhibitors would not affect the hypoxia/reperfusion injury in H/R group.

Assay for Cell Viability

The cell viability was evaluated by MVS assay (Sathishkumar, K. et al., Free Radicals and Antioxidant Protocols, 51-61, 2010). Briefly, at the end of the cell culture, the cells were overlaid with 100 μL of 2×mitochondrial viability stain in each well containing 100 μL of medium and then incubated under normoxic condition (95% air/5% CO2) for 4 h in the dark. The fluorescent intensity was measured at excitation 550 nm and emission 590 nm by a TECAN Infinite M200 micro plate reader (Tecan, Durham, USA).

Western Blot Analysis

At the end of the cell culture, the cells were harvested after H/R, washed twice with cold PBS, and immersed in lysis buffer which containing 0.5% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4° C., and the supernatants were collected and stored at −80° C. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., USA). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) fractions were loaded onto and separated by 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in Tris-glycine buffer at 80 V for 90 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies, MA, USA) commenced overnight at 4° C. Afterwards, they were washed thrice with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected using the enhanced ECL method (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). Densitometric analysis of band intensity was performed using Lablmage software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., USA).

Measurement of Nitric Oxide (NO) Production

The concentration of NO in the culture medium was determined by the Griess reaction with minor changes (Chen, X. P. et al., Journal of Neuroinflammation 9, 2012). At the end of the cell culture, 40 μL cell culture fluid, 10 μL NADPH, and 40 μL basal solution (0.03 M PBS; 1.25 mM glucose-6-phosphate; 400 U/L glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 200 U/L nitrate reeducates) was incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate for 45 min at room temperature. Next, 50 μL Griess reagent was added and the solution incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was measured at 540 nm. Concentrations of NO in the sample were calibrated with a reference standard of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) supplied with the kit and the levels of NO were expressed as μM.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis

The percentage of apoptotic cells measured using the Annexin-V/PI kit for flow cytometry as manufacturer's instruction. At the end of the cell culture, the cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were re-suspended in 1× binding buffer containing propidium iodide (PI) and FITC-labelled Annexin V and incubated for 15 min at 37° C. in the dark, and analyzed with flow cytometry (FACS Vantage-BD Sciences, USA). The data was analyzed using Flow J software for determining the percent of apoptotic cells.

Determination of Caspase Activity

Caspase-3/7 and -9 activities in H9c2 cells were measured as described previously (Lu, C. et al., J Cerebr Blood F Met 30, 1972-1981, 2010), using a Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega, Wis.). At the end of the cell culture, the reagents were added to the cell culture in 1:1 dilutions. This reagent causes lysis of the cell and cleavage of the DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate, which is freed and degraded by luciferase enzyme. Thus, a luminescent signal is emitted corresponding to caspase-3/7 and -9 activities.

Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP)

MMP was measured using the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA). MMP depolarization resulted in the loss of Rh123 from the mitochondria and a decrease in intracellular fluorescence. At the end of the cell culture, Rh123 was added to cultured cells to achieve a final concentration of 10 μM for 30 min at 37° C. The fluorescence was observed by using confocal laser-scanning microscope.

ATP Content Measurement

The ATP level of the cells was measured by a luminescent ATP detection assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manual. The ATP concentrations were collected from duplicate wells of 3 independent experiments and detected by the Infinite M200 pro microplate reader.

Effect of AP1 on Mitochondrial Respiration in H9c2 Cells

The effect of AP1 on mitochondrial respiration was assessed in H9c2 cells using the XFp extracelluar Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Massachusetts, USA) according to a protocol modified after that allows the simultaneous measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an indicator of mitochondrial respiration (Duicu, O. M. et al., Rev Chim-Bucharest 66, 519-522, 2015). H9c2 cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well in Seahorse XFp cell culture miniplates (in duplicate) and pretreated without or with AP1 (200 μg/mL) for 1 h, and then exposed to hypoxia for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for another 4 h. The normal group (Normal) was always maintained in normoxic condition. The sensor cartridge for the XFp analyzer was hydrated in 37° C. non-CO2 incubator at the day before experiment. At the end of cell culture, the incubation media was replaced by unbuffered XF assay medium (provided by Seahorse Co.) containing 2.5 M glucose. OCR rates were measured over the time to establish the baseline rates. Afterwards the cells were metabolically challenged (in order to shift their bioenergetic profile) by three successive additions: oligomycin (10 μM), FCCP (2 μM), and Rotenone & antimycin A (0.5 μM). Previous studies were performed to optimize the cell seeding density and the FCCP concentrations, respectively (data not shown). Background correction wells (i.e., wells that were not seeded with cells) were included in the assay to normalize the data to the background plate noise. The following OCR parameters were recorded: (1) the basal respiration of the cells; (2) the percent of O2 consumption required for the ATP production (ATP turnover); (3) the amount of O2 consumption devoted to maintain the proton gradient (proton leak); (4) the maximal respiratory rate under conditions of uncoupled respiration. For further analysis, mitochondrial parameters were corrected to the non-mitochondrial respiration and instrumental background. OCR was reported in units of pmol/min/μg protein.

Results

After fractionating the crude Panax ginseng extract comprising HSCCC separation of 4.12 g RSE extract, the elution was collected in 48 tubes. When the separation was stopped, there was still 1000 mL solution (the lower phase plus the upper phase in total) in the HSCCC column that was pushed out by high-pressure gas to make the last two fractions. As illustrated in FIG. 1, these fractions were combined to 9 fractions according to the similarity in their TLC pattern. RSE 1 was tube 1, RSE 2 was tubes 2˜3, RSE 3 was tube 4, RSE 4 was tubes 5˜8, RSE 5 was tubes 9˜13, RSE 6 was tubes 14˜28, RSE 7 was tubes 29˜48, RSE 8 was the upper phase of the solution remained in the column, and RSE 9 was the lower phase. The recovery of RSE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 was 2.99, 46.85, 35.73, 1.52, 0.35, 0.41, 0.37, 2.15, and 3.98, respectively, and the total recovery was 94.36%.

Among them, RSE 2 and RSE 3 were two most active fractions (FIG. 3) that exhibited identical molecular distribution pattern as revealed by HPGPC (FIG. 2). As shown in FIG. 2, in addition to the small molecules (<1800 Da), macromolecules varying from 1800 Da to 10.6×105 Da were also found as the major components, showing that RSE 2 and RSE 3 are the polysaccharide fractions of RSE. Further stepwise ethanol precipitation of the RSE 2/RSE 3 mixture as carbohydrate enriched Panax ginseng extract offered five fractions.

Among these five fractions, the carbohydrate enriched precipitate obtained by precipitation in 70% ethanol (recovery rate was 21.88%) exhibited the strongest activity (FIG. 4) and was further subjected onto ion-exchange column chromatography on Toyopearl DEAE 650 M. Five eluate fractions were collected, and named NP (neutral polysaccharides), AP1 (acid polysaccharides 1), AP2, AP3 and AP4. After dialysis and lyophilization, they accounted for 28.96%, 39.39%, 5.24%, 1.37%, 1.12% of total 70% ethanol precipitate fraction, respectively. The total recovery was 76.15%. Among them, the carbohydrate composition AP1 was the major fraction and showed the strongest activity (FIG. 5). AP1 accounts from 7.11% of RSE.

The total sugar content of the carbohydrate composition AP1 was determined to be 90.28% using Glc as the reference. Its uronic acid content was determined to be 17.93% using Gal A as the standard. The protein content was determined to be 9.85%. The apparent molecular weight of AP1 was estimated to be 3.8×104, with reference to dextran. As shown in FIG. 6, sugar composition analysis revealed that AP1 was mainly composed of glucose (Glc, 76.31%), galactose (Gal, 12.70%) with small amount of galacturonic acid (Gal A, 5.64%), arabinose (Ara, 3.72%), and glucuronic acid (Glc A, 1.64%). Based on these results, AP1 was characterized to be an acidic heteroglycan.

As presented in FIG. 7, treatment with the carbohydrate composition AP1 at concentrations of 6.25 μg/mL to 800 μg/mL resulted in no significant alterations in H9c2 cell growth. However, treatment with even higher concentrations (>800 μg/mL) of AP1 resulted in a significant loss of cell viability. Therefore, the optimal and nontoxic concentrations of AP1 were proposed to be 6.25 to 800 μg/mL in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.

The protective effect of the carbohydrate composition AP1 against H/R-induced injury in H9c2 cells wax evaluated by morphological change (FIG. 8A to 8E) and MVS assay (FIG. 9). As indicated in FIG. 8A, normal H9c2 cells adhered to the plate uniformly, with a filamentous shape, which was consistent with other reports (Sardao, V. A. et al., Cell Biol Toxicol 25, 227-243, 2009). On the contrary, when exposed to hypoxia for 3 h and reoxygenated for 4 h, H9c2 cells exhibited morphological variations, i.e. becoming round or irregular in shape, indicating the cytotoxic capacity of H/R injury (FIG. 8B). However, the cell status appeared much better in the cells pretreated with different dosages of AP1 (12.5 to 200 μg/mL). Moreover, when RSE and AP1 intervenes with the H/R damage cells under the same concentration (200 μg/mL), by morphological change, it can be seen that the morphology of cells pretreated with AP1 is significantly better than that with RSE (FIG. 8C vs. FIG. 8D). Meanwhile, in the positive group, pretreatment with diazoxide (DZ), a mitochondria potassium channel opener (Janjua, M. B. et al., Journal of the American College of Surgeons 219, 803-813, 2014) and proven to exert protective effects against I/R injury in hearts and cardiomyocytes (Henn, M. C. et al., Journal of the American College of Surgeons 221, 319-325, 2015) at 100 μM also brought a significant protection in H/R induced cell death as did by AP1 and RSE (FIG. 8E). This phenomenon has been further verified through MVS experiment (FIG. 9). It can be seen that the influence of AP1 and RSE under the same concentrations on the cell activity has significantly statistical significance (###P<0.001 vs. RSE); the protection of AP1 to H9c2 cell can be remarkably increased by about 20% as compared to RSE (FIG. 9).

Evidences indicate that ginseng could exert its cardio-protective effect by activating RISK pathway, which is the term given to a group of pro-survival protein kinases (including PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, and eNOS) that confer powerful cardio-protection (Zhou, H. et al., J Ethnopharmacol 135, 287-298, 2011). It has been examined whether the cardio-protective effect of AP1 is related to the activation of these pathways. As shown in FIG. 10, H/R led to significant suppression of GR and ER (FIGS. 10A and 10B). Although H/R had no influence on the expression of Erk1/2, PI3K/Akt and eNOS, it significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, PI3K/Akt and eNOS (FIGS. 10C, F, G and H). H/R also induced significant increase of iNOS expression (FIG. 10I). AP1 pretreatment increased the protein level of GR, ER and the phosphorylated expression of PI3K, Akt, Erk1/2 and eNOS, and suppressed the expression of iNOS in a dose dependent manner. The effect of AP1 on these proteins is even better than the positive control diazoxide. All these results indicate that AP1 has a great cardio-protective potential possibly through regulating RISK pathway.

To further confirm whether the above signaling pathways were involved in the pre-survival function of AP1, H9c2 cells were pre-incubated with the GR inhibitor mifepristone, the ER inhibitor tamoxifen, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the Akt inhibitor IV, the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME and exposed to H/R injury in the absence or presence of AP1. As a result, these inhibitors abolished the protective effects of AP1 on H/R-induced cell death, showing that these proteins play an important role in the cardio-protective effects of AP1 in H9c2 cells (FIG. 11).

The suppressed production of nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be a cause of ischemia and reperfusion injury of the heart. But findings of the salutary effects of NO enhancement on such injury have been conflicting. It has been evaluated whether NO enhancement would attenuate ischemia/reperfusion injury. To determine whether protective effects of the carbohydrate composition AP1 against H/R-induced cell death are via an NO-mediated mechanism, the amount of NO produced was measured. The results showed pretreatment of AP1 at 200 μg/mL in H9c2 cells that underwent a H/R process resulted in a remarkable elevation of the amount of NO by 61.1% (compared with the H/R group, P<0.001). Furthermore, the H/R induced NO production was significantly abolished by specific eNOS inhibitor, L-NAME (10 μmol/L).

Apoptosis is the major mechanism of cell death immediately following a short period of ischemia with ensuring reperfusion. The cellular apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (FIG. 13A to 13F). Annexin V/PI double staining demonstrated significant apoptotic increase in the H/R group indicating an apoptotic cell accumulation of 46.0%±1.2%, while AP1 at the concentration of 50 and 200 μg/mL as well as the positive control DZ significantly attenuated H/R induced apoptosis (30.3%±4.7%, 18.1%±2.2% and 22.2±3.8%).

To determine the association of cell apoptosis with mPTP, the change of mitochondrial membrane potential has been evaluated as an indicator of mPTP opening. Exposure of cardiomyocytes with 3 h hypoxia followed by 4 h reperfusion resulted in a decrease in Rh123 fluorescence as detected by confocal microscopy when compared to normal cells, indicating H/R-induced mitochondria dysfunction in H9c2 cells (FIGS. 14A and 14B). However, the decrease in Rh123 fluorescence upon exposure with H/R was restored by AP1 (FIGS. 14C and 14D).

The balance of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins in the Bcl-2 family plays an important role in the control of mPTP opening and cell survival against ischemia-reperfusion injuries (Chen, Q. et al., PLoS One 10, e0118834, 2015). To determine whether H/R induced cell apoptosis is associated with a change in the Bcl-2 family proteins, the expression of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. An increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax and a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were found after H9c2 cells were treated with H/R. However, pretreatment with AP1 antagonized all the above effects induced by H/R treatment and significantly attenuated the decrease of the intracellular ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax (FIG. 15).

An additional test was performed to assess myocardial apoptosis with greater specificity. To investigate whether the blocking H/R induced apoptosis by AP1 is dependent on caspase activation, the activities of caspase-3/7 and -9 have been examined, which are initiating caspases in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. As shown in FIG. 16, after treatment of cells with H/R, the activities of caspase-3/7, -9 were enhanced by 4.5 and 9.6-fold, as compared to normal group. However, pretreatment with AP1 (50 and 200 μg/mL) significantly attenuated these increase of caspase activities in a dose-dependent manner.

ATP generation is also an essential marker for mitochondrial function (Dong, G. et al. Mitochondrion 26, 7-18, 2016). ATP levels of H/R group were significantly lower than that of the normal group, which was alleviated more by 200 μg/mL AP1 treatment (FIG. 17). These results suggested that AP1 supplementation largely preserved mitochondrial function under H/R conditions in cardiac cells.

OCR is an important feature of mitochondrial function. Compared with the normal cells, H/R significantly decreased OCR (Basal) and OCR (Maximal), indicating that H/R inhibits oxygen consumption. With AP1 treatment, OCR (Maximal) was significantly increased, indicating that AP1 ameliorated the oxygen consumption in H/R. (FIG. 18). All these indicate that the carbohydrate composition AP1 protects the mitochondrial function against H/R injury by increasing the MMP, ATP content, and mitochondrial respiration, and by increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio.
