# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to the field of bio-medicine and biological testing or detection. Specifically, it relates to the identification of the complete set of linear B-cell epitopes in the main capsid protein L1 from HPV 58, and their epitope motifs as well as their applications in preparing vaccines and testing kits for HPV58.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Chemical synthesized peptides were expected to be the third milestone, following inactivated virus vaccines and virus subunit vaccines, in the history of human vaccine development. However, none of preventative or therapeutic synthetic peptide vaccines comprising one or two epitopes (epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies and B cells. See the definition in the DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION) have been approved for clinical applications since 1970s due to the lack of sufficient and efficient immune effects against viruses. Therefore, in order to achieve sufficient and efficient preventive effects against viruses for clinical applications, synthetic peptide vaccines should combine more linear B-cell epitopes if possible (multi-epitope peptide immunogen can be prepared with bioengineering). In addition, single-epitope peptides consisting of 12˜20 amino acids are usually used as antigen reagents to detect serum antibodies for the diagnosis of virus infections because natural virus proteins are usually unavailable.

It has been known that a linear B-cell epitope usually consists of 3˜8 amino acids. Therefore, it is obvious that using a longer peptide as testing antigen could have problems because it might contain additional epitopes that are recognized by specific antibodies among thousands of antibodies that are present in normal human serum, resulting in high false positive detection rates. In order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the epitope peptide antigens in diagnosing virus infections and autoimmune diseases, a new trend has been to use short epitope peptides based on minimal motifs, and/or to develop a multi-epitope peptide antigen comprising as many precise epitope motifs as possible on a specific target antigen protein. The former strategy could avoid false positive results, and the rafter will improve detection sensitivity since multiple epitopes in a target protein would be recognized by more antibodies, and this strategy is particularly useful for detecting lower antibody titers elicited by viral infections or autoimmune diseases.

In addition, using the short epitope peptides based on precise motifs also will improve the effectiveness of making monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for the development of therapeutic biologics or detection agents. Obviously, whether these goals can be achieved by using short epitope peptides or multi-epitope peptides to develop detection antigen, vaccines or therapeutic biologics, will first depend on the identification of a complete set of linear B-cell epitopes and their precise motifs in a target antigen protein.

A large amount ohf research data demonstrated that cervical cancer, which ranks 2nd globally in the death rates of female cancers, is 90% related to persisted infection at the epidermal of gynecological tract with high-risk (HR-) HPV subtypes, such as HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45 (1). Currently, two pharmaceutical companies (Merck in the U.S. and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in UK] have developed preventative HPV vaccines that comprise L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, and L1 protein of HPV 16 and 18-L1 proteins, respectively. Even though much research has been done in developing HPV peptide vaccines, there is no report of market approval regarding these peptide vaccines.

Because most women infected by HPV can usually automatically eliminate the infected HPV, and only those, who are continuously infected by HPV, will resulted in cervical cancer, it becomes very important to develop inexpensive and convenient serum detection for HPV infection. Obviously, screening with such detection kits has great significance because such screening can determine who are the objects of vaccination with specific preventative or therapeutic HPV vaccines and what types of specific HPV vaccines should be used. Because of the limitations of early methodologies for epitope identification, it is almost impossible to identify a complete set of linear epitopes (particularly their minimal motifs) on a target protein. Identification of such epitopes or their minimal motifs can improve the detection accuracy, avoiding cross reactions with one or some of thousands of antibodies against unknown antigens present in normal human serum. Currently, no sensitive specific serological detection method for HPV infection has been established, even though in the early time, HPV-infected serum was used to identify specific markers for serological detection of HPV infections (2-5).

HPV 58 is one of the high-risk (HR)-HPVs after HPV 16 and 18 (6). Recent research also demonstrated that high positive detection rates for HPV 58 have been shown in cervical cancer patients in many areas of China including Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan (7-15). In some areas of China the detection rates for HPV 58 is even higher than those for HPV18 and only secondary to HPV16 (16-17).

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In view of the stated facts that the HR-HPV 58 is highly epidemic in many areas of China, and that the research on identifying linear B-cell epitopes of HPV 58-L1 protein has not been conducted both in China and abroad, we made efforts in order to develop preventative or therapeutic multi-epitope peptide vaccines against HPV 58 and to develop detection kits using multi-epitope peptide as antigen for HPV58 infection. We used E. coli to express HPV58-L1N36-233 and -L1C226-524 proteins (having overlaps each other by 8 residues), and prepared rabbit sera against recombinant (r-) L1N and r-L1C protein, respectively. We also employed the biosynthetic peptide method improved by us (18-19) in epitope mapping of L1 protein from HPV 58. Finally, we conducted a complete and fine mapping of linear B-cell epitopes and their minimal motifs on L1 capsid protein of HPV 58.

Some embodiments of the invention relate to minimal motifs of linear B-cell epitopes in L1 protein from HPV 58. These motifs have the amino acid sequences listed below:

The epitope minimal motifs in L1 protein from HPV 58 described above can be used to develop preventative and/or therapeutic multi-epitope peptide vaccines or biologics against HPV 58. For example, peptides containing these motifs may be used to immunize individuals or to produce antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic uses.

The epitope minimal motifs in L1 protein from HPV 58 described above can be used as marker antigen(s) to develop detective kits for HPV 58. They can be synthesized as a single peptide, which may contain one or more motifs, or can be expressed biologically either as a single peptide fused with a suitable protein (e.g., GST188 or with other vector protein), or as multi-epitope peptide antigens.

HPV58/L1-11331-335 (QLFNK) versus HPV18/L1366-371, HPV30/L1312-316, HPV33/L1305-310, HPV45/L1334-339 and low risky HPV6b/L1301-305;

HPV58/L1-5213-217 (PLELF) is a highly conserved epitope (expressed as PLELX, X is an alternative amino acid residue) among HR-HPVs which can be seen in HPV16/L1213-217, HPV18/L1248-252, HPV30/L1194-198, HPV31/L1188-192, HPV33/L1187-191, HPV39/L1186-190, HPV45/L1214-218 and HPV73/L1185-189. All the expressed 8-mer peptides (-GST188) that contain the motif PLELX in L1 protein from above HR-HPVs can be recognized by rabbit serum raised against HPV 58-L1N.

Meanwhile, the following sequences are the B-cell epitopes specific for the L1 protein of HPV58, and can be used alone or in combination as epitope peptide markers for serological detection of HPV58 infection. These sequences are HPV58/L1-2B (GHPYLN146-151), -3B (YPAQPGS162-168), -4 (ATDC208-211), -8 (FGTLQAM236-242), -12 (GTYK378-381), -13 (DNFKEY383-388) and -15 (KAKPRLK500-506).

While the above description refers to minimal motifs and 8-mer peptides, one skilled in the art would know that these motifs or peptides may be contained in a longer peptide or protein (e.g., fusion proteins) for the intended use (immunization, diagnosis, or therapeutic uses). In addition, such motifs or peptides may be coupled to other moieties, such as other organic ligands.

Some embodiments of the invention relate to the use of these peptides or motifs. Some exemplary uses may include preventive use (as immunogens) or therapeutic uses. For therapeutic uses, these peptides may be used to generate monoclonal or polycolonal antibodies. Similarly, thess peptides and their antibodies may be used in diagnosis. The methods of antibody generation are well known in the art, as well as the methods of using peptides and/or antibodies in diagnosis (e.g., ELISA).

### Experimental Methods

This invention can be further described as below:

1. The clone of HPV 58 genome was purchased from commercial resource (20). With regular PCR method, the N terminal and C terminal of full-length HPV58-L1 cDNA were amplified from the HPV 58 genome we purchased and then were reconstructed into pRSET-C fusion expression plasmid. The expressed r-L1N36-233 and r-L1C226-524 proteins were purified from E. coli, and finally used as antigen to immunize three New Zealand white rabbits to prepare rabbit antisera against r-L1N36-233 or r-L1C226-524, respectively.

2. Previously we have constructed a fusion expression plasmid pXXGST-1 specially used for 8/18-mer short peptide biosynthesis in epitope mapping. In this plasmid, the macromolecule protein carrier was a truncated glutathione S-transferases (GST) with 188 residues (GST188) (China Patent NO.: 200710173305.2; 18). DNA recombinant technology was employed to express two sets of 18-mer peptides overlapping each other by 10 residues covering the domains of L1N36-233 and L1C226-524 fused with GST188, respectively. Specifically the DNA fragments encoding different short peptide were inserted into pXXGST-1 plasmid after annealing of chemically synthesized plus and minus DNA strands to double-strand DNA. The E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with recombinant plasmids respectively, and then each positive clone was DNA-sequenced by Shanghai Jierui Biotech Co. Ltd. Each verified clone was used to express a fusion protein containing a target short peptide by thermal induction. As results, a set of 24 short peptide-GST fusion proteins for L1N and a set of 36 short peptide-GST fusion proteins for L1C were prepared. The former set is numbered as P1˜P24 (P1˜P23 are 18-mer peptides while P24 is a 15-mer peptide), the latter set is numbered as P25˜P60 (P25˜P59 are 18-mer peptides while P60 is a 19-mer peptide). The expressed P1˜P60 fusion proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Epitope mapping of L1 protein was done with rabbit serum raised against r-L1N and r-L1C protein, respectively. As results, there were 10 reactive peptides (P1, P9-P10, P14-P16, P21-P24) for L1N and 13 reactive peptides (P25-P27, P33-P34, P37-P38, P43-P44, P53-P54 and P59-P60) for L1C. The identification was conducted by Western-blotting (FIG. 1).

Each set of 8-mer peptide (fused with GST188, covering each reactive 18-mer peptide and overlapping each other by 7 residues) were further expressed using above mentioned approaches. Each set of 8-mer peptide were named as P61-P71 for P1, P72-P82 for P9, P83-P106 for P14, P15, and P16, P107-P118 for P22, P119-P152 for P24, P25, P26 and P27, P153-163 for P33, P164-P174 for P37, P175-P193 for P43 and P44, P194-P209 for P53 and P54, and P210-P221 for P59 and P60 relative to reactive peptides of P1, P9, P 14, P15, P16, P22 and P24. (If there were two or more neighboring reactive 18-mer peptides, such as P9-P10 and P14-P16, a set of eleven 8-mer peptides of P9 or P14 were usually first expressed for minimal motif mapping. If its fine epitope motif was not within the overlapping sequence of P9 and P10, meaning that the motif was not shared by two neighboring 18-mer peptides, another set of 8-mer peptides of P10 were expressed). Minimal motif mapping of all 8-mer peptide fusion proteins was done using rabbit serum against r-L1N or r-L1C protein.

The epitope minimal motif was identified according to the common sequence within the neighboring several reactive 8-mer peptides with the fine epitope mapping (see FIG. 2). Finally, eighteen epitope minimal motifs were mapped or identified among twenty-three reactive 18-mer peptides, indicating that there were eighteen B-cell epitopes in the L1 protein from HPV 58. Among these peptides, P1 had only one epitope (YLPPVP38-43). P9 and P10 shared a common epitope (PNKFGF107-112). P59 had one unique epitope (KAKPRLK500-506) and shared one epitope)(ASP508-510) with the neighboring P60, and P25 had two epitopes sharing one epitope with the neighboring P24 (DTGF228-231) and one with P26(FGTLQAM236-242), respectively.

The verification of the eighteen B-cell epitopes in the L1 protein from HPV 58 demonstrated that these minimal motifs and/or their extended 8-mer peptides can be used as candidate peptides for developing preventative HPV58 multi-epitope peptide vaccines. Among them seven of HPV58 specific B-cell epitope peptides as well as their multi-epitope peptides can be used as specific antigen markers to detect HPV58 infection.

Mapping of the epitopes in the L1 protein from HPV58 with rabbit sera can be specifically described as below:


- 1. DNAs were designed for encoding two sets of 18-mer peptides
  overlapping each other by 10 residues and covering L1N³⁶⁻²³³ and
  L1C²²⁶⁻⁵²⁴. Then the plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding
  each 18 mer peptides (numbered as P1-P60) were synthesized by Shanghai

  cooling to room temperature. In 15 μl of the reaction mixture, 2 μL
  annealing fragments, 1 μL of 200 ng/μL pXXGST-1 plasmids digested with
  BamH I and Sal I, 1 μL T4 DNA ligase and 1.5 μL buffer were mixed and
  incubated overnight. The ligation solution was transformed into
  BL21(DE3) host, then the bacteria was smeared on the Luria Broth
  medium (LB) plates containing ampicillin. After overnight culture at
  37□, the growing colonies (one colony for one clone) on the LB plate
  were inoculated into 3 mL LB culture solution for inducible
  expression. The expressed GST188-18 mer (P1-P60) fusion proteins were
  analyzed and verified through 15% SDS-PAGE (about 2 kDa mobility
  difference from the control) using GST188 protein as control which was
  expressed with pXXGST-2 plasmid. Each recombinant clone was picked and
  cultured for DNA sequencing.
- 3. The clones with correct sequencing results were inoculated into 3
  mL LB medium containing ampicillin and cultured overnight at 30° C.
  with shaking. The inoculums (or cultured solution) was inoculated into
  fresh LB medium containing ampicillin at 1:50 (inoculums:fresh medium)
  and cultured at 30° C. with shaking for 2˜3 hrs until OD₆₀₀ reaches
  0.6˜0.8. The temperature was up-regulated to 42° C. and then incubated
  for 4 hr for heat inducing expression. Then the bacteria were
  harvested by centrifugation, and was added with lysate, and finally
  was boiled for 5 min for further usage.
- 4. The total expressed bacteria proteins were separated with 15%
  SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, one gel was stained with Coomassie
  blue, while the other gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
  at 100 mA for 2 hrs. The membrane was stained with ponceaux for 2
  mins. Pictures were taken with digital camera before washing off the
  ponceaux.

  blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder overnight. After additional
  washing with PBS buffer for four times, the membrane was incubated for
  2 hrs at room temperature in 8˜10 ml reaction solution mixed with 30
  μL of the rabbit serum raised against r-L1N or r-L1C protein or with
  30 μL of pre-immune rabbit serum. After washing with PBS buffer, the
  membrane was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in 10 ml of

  protein from HPV58 were identified using rabbit serum raised against
  r-L1N or r-L1C protein (FIGS. 1A and 1C). However, no positive bands
  were seen when using pre-immune rabbit serum as shown in FIGS. 1B and
  1C.

**Example 2**

**Mapping of the BCE Minimal Motif of the Reactive Peptide P27**

Materials and Methods: (refer to the corresponding parts in Example 1)


- 1. The reactive peptide P27 shown in Example 1 (as seen in FIG. 1) was
  taken as an example for mapping the BCE minimal motif of an 18-mer
  peptide. The plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding each
  8-mer peptide (numbered as P142-P152) had an overlap of 7 residues
  each other and covered the whole P27 peptide sequence. The DNAs were
  synthesized by Shanghai Jierui Biotech Co. Ltd.

Steps 2-4 were the same as steps 2-4 in Example 1.

The membrane was washed with PBS buffer for four times and then blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder overnight. After additional washing with PBS buffer for four times, the membrane was incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature in 8-10 ml of reaction solution mixed with 30 μL of rabbit serum raised against r-L1N (1:200 dilution). After washing with PBS buffer, the membrane was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in 10 ml of reaction solution mixed with 5 μL of goat anti human IgG/HRP. Finally the membrane was washed with PBS buffer and then analyzed with electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL), exposed to X-film (FIG. 2A).

The epitope minimal motif DVPID present in the reactive peptide P27 was identified according to the common sequence shown in four reactive 8-mer peptides (P142-P145, FIG. 2B).

This invention described the identification of eighteen B-cell epitopes and their minimal motifs in the L1 protein from HPV58. The 8-mer peptides or 8-mer peptide fusion proteins each containing a minimal motif can be used alone or in combination to develop preventive and/or therapeutic multi-epitope peptide vaccines against HPV58, or to specifically detect HPV58 infection as antigen peptide(s), which could be prepared either by chemosynthesis or by bio-expression as a multi-epitope peptide fusion protein).

Useful peptides of the invention include amino acid sequences comprising one or more of the minimal motifs or the 8-mer peptides of this invention. Such peptides can be expressed biologically as fusion proteins. The fusion proteins of the invention can include, for example, one or more epitope minimal motif(s) in the L1 protein of HPV 58, fused to one or more T-cell epitope peptides, which may come from HPV or non-HPV immunogens or antigens.

As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a material which is combined with a compound of the invention to facilitate transfer or administration of the compound, but which does not preclude its biological activity. Examples include, but are not limited to, standard pharmaceutical carriers such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS), solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsions, and various types of wetting agents. Additional carriers are liposomes, polymer compositions, and the like. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well-known conventional methods (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapter 43, 14th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.).

Useful compositions of the invention include one or more peptides and/or fusion proteins of the invention combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or other pharmaceutical additive ingredients. The composition can include an adjuvant capable of enhancing an immune response to the epitope of the peptides or fusion proteins of the invention. Suitable adjuvants are known and include, for example, emulsifiers, Quil A, mineral oil, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, etc.

The vaccines of the invention comprise an effective therapeutic dose of the immunogenic HPV epitope peptides sufficient to induce the production of anti-HPV 58-L1 antibodies, thus resulting in a preventive or therapeutic effect. Preferably, the vaccine is effective to produce such an effect in humans.

Nucleic acid sequences of the invention encode the amino acid sequences of the HPV58-L1 epitopes and peptides of the invention, and include both deoxyribo- and ribonucleic acids. The nucleic acid sequences can be included in a vector for expression of the amino acids in a host cell. Vectors suitable for expression are known, and include, but are not limited to, bacterial expression vectors, yeast expression vectors, and baculovirus vectors. The HPV 58-L1's epitopes are expressed in a host cell, when the host cell is cultured under suitable conditions. Host cells can include, but are not limited to, silk worm larvae, CHO cells, E. coli, and yeast.

Methods of recovery of peptides expressed in host cells are known. Vectors, hosts, methods of expressing vectors and recovering peptides are known (see, for example, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, the 3rd edition and translated by Peitang Huang, Science Press, 2002, and O'Reilley et al., Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Oxford University Press, 1994).

The B-cell epitopes in L1 protein of HPV 58 and their fine motifs of the invention are preferably used to induce anti-HPV 58-L1 antibodies in a host animal. For example, a fusion protein comprising one or more of the amino acid sequence(s) of this invention, with or without T-cell epitopes from HPVs or non-HPV immunogens, is administered to an animal, for example by injection. The immunogen may be delivered with an adjuvant, as known in the field. The course of administration may be one or multiple boosters, as needed to induce anti-HPV antibody titer. Thereafter, maintenance doses can be administered as required to retain a sufficient antibody titer. The appropriate dose and immunization regimen for the peptide, peptide composition, or vaccine of the invention can be determined by one of skill in the art, armed with the information provided in this text and the Examples in this text.

In addition, the minimal motif(s) of the epitope(s) as well as their extended peptide(s) of this invention can be used as antigen alone or in combination to specifically detect the sera from subjects with HPV 58 infection. Since natural virus proteins are not usually available or are very difficult to prepare, the amino acid sequence of the invention can be used to prepare antigen reagent in detecting serum antibodies for the diagnosis of HPV 58 infection, or more types of HPV infection by using the 100% conserved epitope peptides among HR-HPVs of this invention.

The above specification, examples, and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereafter appended.
