    "abstract": "The human zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 (hZP3) by virtue of its critical role during fertilization has been proposed as a promising candidate antigen to develop a contraceptive vaccine. In this direction, it is imperative to map minimal motifs of the B cell epitopes (BCEs) so as to avoid ZP-specific oophoritogenic T cell epitopes (TCEs) in the ZP3-based immunogens. In this study, based on known results of mapping marmoset and bonnet monkey ZP3 (mstZP3 and bmZP3), two predictableepitopes23\u201330 and 301\u2013320on hZP3 were first confirmed and five minimal motifs within four epitopes on hZP3 were defined using serum to recombinanthZP3a22\u2013176orhZP3b177\u2013348as well as a biosynthetic peptide strategy.

                "The human zona pellucida (hZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding eggs, which consists of four sulfated glycoproteins designated as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4 [1, 2]. ZP glycoproteins mediate several critical events during fertilization process such as initial recognition and binding of the spermatozoa to the egg in a species-specific manner, induction of the acrosome reaction in the zona-bound spermatozoon, and prevention of polyspermy [3, 4]. By virtue of their critical role during fertilization, ZP glycoproteins have been proposed as target for developing contraceptive vaccines [5, 6]. Although active immunization with purified or recombinant ZP (r-ZP) proteins induces infertility in various mammalian species, the contraceptive efficacy is invariably associated with either transient alteration or complete loss of ovarian function [7\u201310]. The observed ovarian pathology following active immunization with ZP antigens may be due to (i) presence of ZP-specific T-cell epitopes (TCE) within a B-cell epitope (BCE), for example peptide corresponding to mouse ZP3 (mZP3) amino acid (aa) residues 330\u2013342 (peptide330\u2013342) [11], (ii) autoimmune ovarian disease (AOD) that can be adoptively transferred by the ZP3 peptide-activated CD4+ T-cells to na\u00efve recipients but does not occur when only antipeptide antibodies are administered [12], and (iii) the minimal and modified BCE peptide335\u2013342 of mZP3, which had no longer a ZP-specific TCE (phenylalanine, a key residue of the \u201coophoritogenic\u201d TCE, substituted by alanine), induced infertility in mice with eight different haplotypes without any AOD when it was co-linearly synthesized with a foreign \u201cpromiscuous\u201d TCE [13].",
                "The above observations clearly suggest a new possible approach of developing BCE peptide-based ZP vaccines for fertility control, which should be devoid of any ZP-specific TCE. Therefore, efforts have been made by several laboratories to delineate infertility-associated BCEs of ZP proteins since a BCE on mZP3 was first identified by Dean et al. [14]. For instance, five BCE peptides45\u201364,\u2009\u200993\u2013110,\u2009\u2009137\u2013150,\u2009\u2009172\u2013190\u2009\u2009and\u2009\u2009334\u2013341 of hZP3 have been mapped [15\u201317] and additional two epitopes corresponding to aa residue 23\u201330 and 301\u2013320 of hZP3 have also been predicted based on the mapping results of marmoset ZP3 (mstZP3) and bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata; bmZP3) proteins [18, 19], because their aa sequences are highly conserved among mstZP3 and hZP3 as well as bmZP3 and hZP3 proteins. To eliminate potential oophoritis-inducing TCE within a mapped longer BCE peptide, the identification of minimal motif of mapped BCEs on hZP3 has been hampered due to the limitation of available mapping methods. So far, only the minimal motif of the BCE on the C-terminus of hZP3 has been identified using rabbit serum [16].",
                "We have reported previously the identification of a minimal motif of hZP4314\u2013319 epitope using improved peptide biosynthesis strategy for the first time, where the truncated streptavidin (Stv108) and glutathione S-transferase (GST188) were used as protein carrier, respectively [20]. In addition, the sera against r-hZP322\u2013176 (hZP3a) and r-hZP3177\u2013348 (hZP3b) were made, which reacted with human oocyte [21]. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to map minimal motifs of four linear BCEs on hZP3 with biosynthetic peptides and antibodies against r-hZP3a or r-hZP3b. Moreover, the immunogenicity of two chemically synthesized peptides171\u2013186\u2009\u2009and\u2009\u2009301\u2013315 of hZP3, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), has also been evaluated in rabbits."

The resultant recombinant plasmids expressing each target short peptide fused with Stv108 or GST188 protein were transformed into the BL21(DE3)(pLysS) E. coli strain (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wis, USA).

As shown in Figure 5(a), the serum against P1 did not react with Stv108 and GST188 carrier proteins (Lanes 5-6), so does the serum against P2 (data not shown), suggesting there was no cross-reactive antibodies with Stv108 and GST188 proteins in their immune sera. In addition, the serum to P2 reacted to 8mer peptides P37 and P44 containing a mapped minimal motif SNFWF or EGP (Figure 5(b), Lanes 9 and 11), confirming our above mapping result, that is, there were two overlapping BCEs within the epitope peptide of hZP3301\u2013320 (Figure 2(e) and Figure 5(b)). As shown in Figure 5, the rabbit serum to P1 or P2 diluted to 1\u2009:\u200950 showed a strong positive reaction with the human ZP (I-J), and red fluorescence was absent when the oocytes were treated with preimmune serum (g-h). These results showed that production of specific immunoglobulin reactive with P1 or P2 epitope peptide and with human ZP was elicited by P1 or P2 peptide in immunized rabbits, respectively."

                "The hZP3 protein has been an interesting target antigen for the development of a contraceptive peptide vaccine. Two BCEs137\u2013150\u2009\u2009and\u2009\u2009334\u2013341 on hZP3 were first identified with serum to each synthetic peptide based on computer prediction or sequence comparison of a known BCE sequence of mZP3 with other ZP3 protein in many mammals [15, 16]. The former 14 mer peptide137\u2013150 (P7) of hZP3, however, was not recognized by both sera to r-hZP3 in ELISA [17] and serum to r-hZP3a in Western blotting (Figure 1(b), Lane 5), suggesting that it might not be a self-epitope peptide of hZP3, although it could elicit antibody capable of binding to native hZP and its antiserum might be used as a marker for the identification of hZP3 protein [15]. For the latter 8 mer peptide334\u2013341 (P11) that elicited antibodies reacting to human ZP in transgenic mice [16], although it failed to be identified by serum to r-hZP3 in the study on epitope mapping of hZP322\u2013360\u2009\u2009 [17], the result that peptide P11 could be recognized by serum to r-hZP3b in this study (Figure 1(b), lane 9) suggested that it should be an epitope of hZP3. As well, the 20 mer peptide45\u201364\u2009\u2009 (P5) of hZP3 mapped by serum to r-hZP3 [17], it could not react to serum to r-hZP3b in this study (Figure 1(b), Lane 3). At present, we cannot explain these distinct mapping results, including the above-mentioned 8mer peptide334\u2013341, because both groups employed different antisera (against r-hZP322\u2013460\u2009\u2009 and r-hZP3a22\u2013176, resp.).",
                "The antigenicity and immunogenicity of hZP3172\u2013190 [17], mstZP3301\u2013320 [18, 26], and bmZP3300\u2013322 [27] were previously reported. These synthetic peptides elicited antibodies capable of reacting to native mstZP, bmZP, and hZP, respectively. The peptide sequence301\u2013320 is highly conserved between mstZP3 and bmZP3 sequences. The mst-serum tomstZP3301\u2013320 linked to a promiscuous helper TCE from tetanus toxoid showed up to 60% of inhibition in human sperm-zona binding in vitro [26]. Conversely, the bm-serum to bmZP3300\u2013322 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid failed to show any significant decrease in sperm-zona binding in hemizona assay [27]. The reasons for this discordance are not clear and more research is required to explain these findings. In the present study, because there is difference of one residue at the position305 of hZP3301\u2013320 (P), mstZP3301\u2013320 (A), and bmZP3301\u2013320 (S), its antigenicity and specificity was preliminarily evaluated using synthetic peptide P2 conjugated with KLH, and was compared with peptide P1. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, peptides P1 and P2 elicited high-titer antibodies reacting with native hZP and r-hZP3b peptide expressed in E. coli, but the antigenicity of the latter was significantly greater than that of the former. For the antigenic diversity of peptides P1 and P2, one possible explanation might be because there were antibodies against two overlapping BCEs (NSNWF306\u2013310 and EGP313\u2013315) within the peptide P2 sequence. As for the efficacy of each antiserum to inhibit human sperm-zona binding, it remains to be further evaluated by carrying out competitive hemizona or sperm-egg binding assays.",
                "The serum to a synthetic peptide was often used to map minimal motif of identified BCE peptide [16, 28]. To further check the specificity of peptides P1 and P2 as antigen, the Western blotting was carried out with two sets of 8 mer peptides (P27~P33 and P34~P46). Surprisingly, the rabbit serum to P1 not only could recognize peptides P28 and P29, but also reacted with peptides P30 and P31 that were not recognized by rabbit serum to r-hZP3b, whereas the serum to P2 only recognized peptides P42 and P43, but did not recognize other peptides (P43\u2013P46) reacted with serum to r-hZP3b (data not shown). The data suggested that their BCE motifs generated a \u201cdrifting\u201d phenomenon when using serum against synthetic peptide P1 or P2 to map minimal motif compared with the result identified with serum to r-hZP3b, that is, the minimal motifs mapped with serum to a synthetic peptide and to a native or r-protein might be different sometimes.",
                "The synthetic peptides method [29\u201331] has been often used to delineate linear BCEs on a protein; however, the number of mapped BCE always was less or some BCEs were missing when using serum to r-protein and ELISA. For instances the following hold. (1) Only 3 BCEs on hZP3, not including a BCE on its C-terminus transmembrane- like domain, were mapped with serum to CHO-expressed r-hZP322\u2013460 [17] compared with the result of mapped 6 BCEs in this study. (2) It could not be defined how many BCEs there were in six of potential reactive neighboring 15mer-peptides (P5\u2013P8, P11-P12, P14\u2013P18, P31\u2013P33, P38-P39, and P43-P44) in the epitope mapping of brushtail possum (bp) ZP240\u2013634 with sera to r-bpZP240\u2013311/305\u2013634 [32], which might be one of causes why several BCE peptides could be missed or could not be defined in above two epitope mapping studies using synthetic peptide library. As we know, there may be only one BCE on mapped two neighboring overlapping peptides because they share a common sequence [33], but there may also be two or three BCEs according to our other epitope mapping results of E6, E7, and L1 proteins from HPV type 58 virus (data not shown). It obviously is a drawback to employ this method to map all BCEs on a protein, because it could not be used to carry out minimal motif identification of each reactive neighboring peptide with serum to r-protein, which is a way of answering how many BCEs there are on them.",
                "Some studies on expression of single 4\u201312mer BCE peptides fused with Stv118 core protein [34] and epitope mapping with several purified short peptides fused with GST226 [35, 36], suggested the possibility of using biosynthetic peptides to map linear BCEs and their minimal motifs on a protein. However, not like the above studies using mAb, chicken sera to SARS-CoV, and SARS convalescent sera, it needs to solve a key problem to employ serum against r-protein, that is, how to avoid interfering of antibodies against some strong antigens from E. coli on distinguishing target blotted bands. Because any r-protein used as immunogen always contains a little bacteria proteins that could not be completely removed when purified at laboratory level. At present, this problem has been solved through using a truncated GST188 or Stv108 as carrier of short peptide expression. As showed in Figure 1, the blotted bands of the GST188-short peptides were to be located in a weak antigenic area of bacterial proteins on blotted membrane, which avoided two blotted bands of bacterial protein with 21\u2009kDa and 31\u2009kDa bands. Obviously, besides simple, cheap, reliable, and adaptable merits mentioned in our previous work [20], the present study showed another two distinct advantages of our improved biosynthetic peptide strategy: (1) it permits using serum against bacteria-expressed protein to map BCEs and their minimal motifs on the target protein; (2) the 8mer\u201320mer peptide fusion proteins expressed by pXXGST-1 or pXXStv-3 plasmid could be used in Western blotting without purifying. In addition, the smallest binding motif of 3 residues for antibodies can be defined with biosynthetic peptides (Figure 2(e) and Figure 3), whereas the length mapped with synthetic peptides method was 4-5 residues [37].",
                "In summary, this study is the first to utilize biosynthetic peptides and sera against r-hZP3a and/or r-hZP3b to map BCEs and their minimal motifs on hZP3 protein. The identification of five minimal motifs within four epitopes on hZP3 will help in developing contraceptive vaccines of multiepitope ZP peptides without ZP-specific TCE activities which may result in ovarian dysfunction for human use in future, and those defined BCE minimal motifs of hZP3 would be also used as specific probes to detect whether there are self- ZP antibodies to each BCE in the sera from patients with infertile and/or premature ovarian failure. Furthermore, the data presented here again clearly suggest that the biosynthetic peptide strategy employed in this study could be used to map all BCEs and precise linear epitopes on other entire ZP proteins in any species."
