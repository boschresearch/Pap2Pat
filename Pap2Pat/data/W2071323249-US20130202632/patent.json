    "abstract": "Minimal Motifs of linear B-cell epitopes in L1 structure protein from human papillomavirus type 58 (HPV 58) and their applications are disclosed. Eighteen linear epitope motifs and their extended 8-mer peptides in the L1 protein from HPV 58 are described, which can be used as antigens separately or in combination to specifically detect the serum from subjects with HPV 58 infection, or to develop preventive or therapeutic multi-epitope peptide vaccines against HPV 58 by inducing humoral immunity. Of the eighteen B-cell epitope motifs, ten of them are 100% conservative and one is highly conservative among many homologous proteins of high-risk HPVs. They can be used as candidate \u201cuniversal\u201d epitopes to develop preventive or therapeutic HPV vaccines. The amino acid sequences of the epitope motifs and the 8-mer peptide formula of the invention are shown below in SEQ ID No. 1-2, 2B, 3, 3B, 4-18, 18B, 19, 19B, and 20-32.",

                        "Chemical synthesized peptides were expected to be the third milestone, following inactivated virus vaccines and virus subunit vaccines, in the history of human vaccine development. However, none of preventative or therapeutic synthetic peptide vaccines comprising one or two epitopes (epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies and B cells. See the definition in the DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION) have been approved for clinical applications since 1970s due to the lack of sufficient and efficient immune effects against viruses. Therefore, in order to achieve sufficient and efficient preventive effects against viruses for clinical applications, synthetic peptide vaccines should combine more linear B-cell epitopes if possible (multi-epitope peptide immunogen can be prepared with bioengineering). In addition, single-epitope peptides consisting of 12\u02dc20 amino acids are usually used as antigen reagents to detect serum antibodies for the diagnosis of virus infections because natural virus proteins are usually unavailable.",
                        "It has been known that a linear B-cell epitope usually consists of 3\u02dc8 amino acids. Therefore, it is obvious that using a longer peptide as testing antigen could have problems because it might contain additional epitopes that are recognized by specific antibodies among thousands of antibodies that are present in normal human serum, resulting in high false positive detection rates. In order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the epitope peptide antigens in diagnosing virus infections and autoimmune diseases, a new trend has been to use short epitope peptides based on minimal motifs, and/or to develop a multi-epitope peptide antigen comprising as many precise epitope motifs as possible on a specific target antigen protein. The former strategy could avoid false positive results, and the rafter will improve detection sensitivity since multiple epitopes in a target protein would be recognized by more antibodies, and this strategy is particularly useful for detecting lower antibody titers elicited by viral infections or autoimmune diseases.",
                        "In addition, using the short epitope peptides based on precise motifs also will improve the effectiveness of making monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for the development of therapeutic biologics or detection agents. Obviously, whether these goals can be achieved by using short epitope peptides or multi-epitope peptides to develop detection antigen, vaccines or therapeutic biologics, will first depend on the identification of a complete set of linear B-cell epitopes and their precise motifs in a target antigen protein.",
                        "A large amount ohf research data demonstrated that cervical cancer, which ranks 2nd globally in the death rates of female cancers, is 90% related to persisted infection at the epidermal of gynecological tract with high-risk (HR-) HPV subtypes, such as HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45 (1). Currently, two pharmaceutical companies (Merck in the U.S. and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in UK] have developed preventative HPV vaccines that comprise L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, and L1 protein of HPV 16 and 18-L1 proteins, respectively. Even though much research has been done in developing HPV peptide vaccines, there is no report of market approval regarding these peptide vaccines.",
                        "Because most women infected by HPV can usually automatically eliminate the infected HPV, and only those, who are continuously infected by HPV, will resulted in cervical cancer, it becomes very important to develop inexpensive and convenient serum detection for HPV infection. Obviously, screening with such detection kits has great significance because such screening can determine who are the objects of vaccination with specific preventative or therapeutic HPV vaccines and what types of specific HPV vaccines should be used. Because of the limitations of early methodologies for epitope identification, it is almost impossible to identify a complete set of linear epitopes (particularly their minimal motifs) on a target protein. Identification of such epitopes or their minimal motifs can improve the detection accuracy, avoiding cross reactions with one or some of thousands of antibodies against unknown antigens present in normal human serum. Currently, no sensitive specific serological detection method for HPV infection has been established, even though in the early time, HPV-infected serum was used to identify specific markers for serological detection of HPV infections (2-5).",
                        "HPV 58 is one of the high-risk (HR)-HPVs after HPV 16 and 18 (6). Recent research also demonstrated that high positive detection rates for HPV 58 have been shown in cervical cancer patients in many areas of China including Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan (7-15). In some areas of China the detection rates for HPV 58 is even higher than those for HPV18 and only secondary to HPV16 (16-17)."

We used E. coli to express HPV58-L1N36-233 and -L1C226-524 proteins (having overlaps each other by 8 residues), and prepared rabbit sera against recombinant (r-) L1N and r-L1C protein, respectively.

                                "1. The clone of HPV 58 genome was purchased from commercial resource (20). With regular PCR method, the N terminal and C terminal of full-length HPV58-L1 cDNA were amplified from the HPV 58 genome we purchased and then were reconstructed into pRSET-C fusion expression plasmid. The expressed r-L1N36-233 and r-L1C226-524 proteins were purified from E. coli, and finally used as antigen to immunize three New Zealand white rabbits to prepare rabbit antisera against r-L1N36-233 or r-L1C226-524, respectively.",
                                "2. Previously we have constructed a fusion expression plasmid pXXGST-1 specially used for 8/18-mer short peptide biosynthesis in epitope mapping. In this plasmid, the macromolecule protein carrier was a truncated glutathione S-transferases (GST) with 188 residues (GST188) (China Patent NO.: 200710173305.2; 18). DNA recombinant technology was employed to express two sets of 18-mer peptides overlapping each other by 10 residues covering the domains of L1N36-233 and L1C226-524 fused with GST188, respectively. Specifically the DNA fragments encoding different short peptide were inserted into pXXGST-1 plasmid after annealing of chemically synthesized plus and minus DNA strands to double-strand DNA. The E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with recombinant plasmids respectively, and then each positive clone was DNA-sequenced by Shanghai Jierui Biotech Co. Ltd. Each verified clone was used to express a fusion protein containing a target short peptide by thermal induction. As results, a set of 24 short peptide-GST fusion proteins for L1N and a set of 36 short peptide-GST fusion proteins for L1C were prepared. The former set is numbered as P1\u02dcP24 (P1\u02dcP23 are 18-mer peptides while P24 is a 15-mer peptide), the latter set is numbered as P25\u02dcP60 (P25\u02dcP59 are 18-mer peptides while P60 is a 19-mer peptide). The expressed P1\u02dcP60 fusion proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Epitope mapping of L1 protein was done with rabbit serum raised against r-L1N and r-L1C protein, respectively. As results, there were 10 reactive peptides (P1, P9-P10, P14-P16, P21-P24) for L1N and 13 reactive peptides (P25-P27, P33-P34, P37-P38, P43-P44, P53-P54 and P59-P60) for L1C. The identification was conducted by Western-blotting (FIG. 1).",
                                "Each set of 8-mer peptide (fused with GST188, covering each reactive 18-mer peptide and overlapping each other by 7 residues) were further expressed using above mentioned approaches. Each set of 8-mer peptide were named as P61-P71 for P1, P72-P82 for P9, P83-P106 for P14, P15, and P16, P107-P118 for P22, P119-P152 for P24, P25, P26 and P27, P153-163 for P33, P164-P174 for P37, P175-P193 for P43 and P44, P194-P209 for P53 and P54, and P210-P221 for P59 and P60 relative to reactive peptides of P1, P9, P 14, P15, P16, P22 and P24. (If there were two or more neighboring reactive 18-mer peptides, such as P9-P10 and P14-P16, a set of eleven 8-mer peptides of P9 or P14 were usually first expressed for minimal motif mapping. If its fine epitope motif was not within the overlapping sequence of P9 and P10, meaning that the motif was not shared by two neighboring 18-mer peptides, another set of 8-mer peptides of P10 were expressed). Minimal motif mapping of all 8-mer peptide fusion proteins was done using rabbit serum against r-L1N or r-L1C protein.",
                                "The epitope minimal motif was identified according to the common sequence within the neighboring several reactive 8-mer peptides with the fine epitope mapping (see FIG. 2). Finally, eighteen epitope minimal motifs were mapped or identified among twenty-three reactive 18-mer peptides, indicating that there were eighteen B-cell epitopes in the L1 protein from HPV 58. Among these peptides, P1 had only one epitope (YLPPVP38-43). P9 and P10 shared a common epitope (PNKFGF107-112). P59 had one unique epitope (KAKPRLK500-506) and shared one epitope)(ASP508-510) with the neighboring P60, and P25 had two epitopes sharing one epitope with the neighboring P24 (DTGF228-231) and one with P26(FGTLQAM236-242), respectively.",
                                "The verification of the eighteen B-cell epitopes in the L1 protein from HPV 58 demonstrated that these minimal motifs and/or their extended 8-mer peptides can be used as candidate peptides for developing preventative HPV58 multi-epitope peptide vaccines. Among them seven of HPV58 specific B-cell epitope peptides as well as their multi-epitope peptides can be used as specific antigen markers to detect HPV58 infection."
