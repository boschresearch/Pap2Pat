# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to bio-medicine and biological testing

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate chemical synthesized peptides
- limitations of early methodologies for epitope identification

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- identify linear B-cell epitopes in L1 protein from HPV 58
- develop preventative or therapeutic multi-epitope peptide vaccines
- develop detection kits using multi-epitope peptide as antigen

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
