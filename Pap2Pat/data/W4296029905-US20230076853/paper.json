    "title": "A digital mask to safeguard patient privacy",
    "date": "2022-09-01",
    "abstract": "The storage of facial images in medical records poses privacy risks due to the sensitive nature of the personal biometric information that can be extracted from such images. To minimize these risks, we developed a new technology, called the digital mask (DM), which is based on three-dimensional reconstruction and deep-learning algorithms to irreversibly erase identifiable features, while retaining disease-relevant features needed for diagnosis. In a prospective clinical study to evaluate the technology for diagnosis of ocular conditions, we found very high diagnostic consistency between the use of original and reconstructed facial videos ( \u03ba \u2265 0.845 for strabismus, ptosis and nystagmus, and \u03ba = 0.801 for thyroid-associated orbitopathy) and comparable diagnostic accuracy ( P \u2265 0.131 for all ocular conditions tested) was observed. Identity removal validation using multiple-choice questions showed that compared to image cropping, the DM could much more effectively remove identity attributes from facial images. We further confirmed the ability of the DM to evade recognition systems using artificial intelligence-powered re-identification algorithms. Moreover, use of the DM increased the willingness of patients with ocular conditions to provide their facial images as health information during medical treatment. These results indicate the potential of the DM algorithm to protect the privacy of patients\u2019 facial images in an era of rapid adoption of digital health technologies.",

                "Protecting the privacy of patients is central to healthcare delivery and has important ethical and medicolegal ramifications. Privacy protection has attained prominence over the past decade because of digitalization and increasingly widespread sharing of medical records and concerns about data breaches. Previous studies have explored the application of anonymization technologies for medical images. Researchers have proposed eliminating all digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) metadata (such as patient name and sex)1, with the application of defacing or skull-stripping algorithms to face or skull regions in DICOM images2. From a privacy perspective, clinical data involving facial images are especially sensitive, given that facial information clearly contains biometric identifying information. It is therefore imperative to protect the facial information of healthcare users to maintain medical privacy and security; however, facial images aiming to record signs of disease, such as strabismus or nystagmus, inevitably record patients\u2019 race, sex, age, mood and other biometric identifiers. Concerning facial images, common anonymizing methods, including blurring and cropping identifiable areas, may lose important disease-relevant information and they cannot fully evade face recognition systems3. An important challenge is, therefore, to separate biometric identity from medical information that can potentially be derived from facial images.",
                "Additionally, the successful development and utility of digital health technology depends on broad participation in medical data collection and the broad participation of large populations requires trust and protection of privacy4; however, digital data studies based on heavy-training image sets have also raised the potential threat of misusing facial recognition technology for unintended and/or unauthorized purposes5,6. Due to the understandable privacy concerns of individuals, people often hesitate to share their medical data for public medical research or electronic health records, thus largely hindering the development of digital medical care. Therefore, it is necessary to update the traditional procedure used to obtain informed consent at the front end of data collection, particularly by ensuring adequate privacy protection for personal health information and somehow improving the willingness of healthcare users to engage with these emerging digital technologies.",
                "In whole facial images, periocular biometrics is one of the most distinctive subsets of individual biometric information of an individual and it can be used to assist in building robust identity verification systems7. Additionally, periocular features are important signs of eye and general health. For example, periocular features, such as deep forehead wrinkles and periorbital wrinkles, are significantly associated with coronary heart disease8 and abnormal topological changes in eye dynamics indicate poor visual function and visual cognitive development problems9. This study aims to protect the biometric information of patients and focuses on four pathological ocular manifestations, namely, thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO), strabismus, ptosis and nystagmus, which involve more than ten abnormal behavioral phenotypes, such as eyelid retraction, overactive or underactive extraocular muscles, horizontal or vertical strabismus, changes in the double eyelid line, poor fixation and compensatory head position.",
                "To extract these disease-relevant features but remove patient identity features from facial images of patients, we developed the DM, a new technology based on real-time three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and deep-learning algorithms. The DM takes an original video as input and outputs a reconstructed video that contains disease information, while discarding as much of the patient\u2019s identity as possible. The refined eye reconstruction is highlighted. Converting DM-reconstructed videos back to raw videos is impossible because most of the information necessary to recreate the original attributes has been discarded and is no longer present in the set of digital representations that constitute the mask.",
                "To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DM approach, we designed a clinical trial (NCT05058599) and evaluated the consistency of the diagnoses of patients with ocular diseases from reconstructed videos and original videos. Identity removal validation was also used to show whether the DM could effectively remove personal biometric attributes. Additionally, we performed an empirical investigation of the receptiveness of patients to applying this new technology to their personal health information. Finally, we conducted an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered reidentification validation to evaluate the performance of the DM in evading recognition systems. The following results show that DM proposes a new approach to safeguarding patient privacy, provides an additional data format for privacy protection and enhances the willingness of patients to share their medical data, thereby benefiting the quickly evolving field of digital health."

                        "In this work, the proposed DM patient privacy protection technology was based on the complementary use of deep learning and 3D reconstruction. Deep learning achieved feature extraction from different facial parts, and 3D reconstruction automatically digitalized the shapes and motions of 3D faces, eyelids and eyeballs based on the extracted facial features (Fig. 1). Different from other face reconstruction methods10\u201316, the proposed technology focused on accurate ocular reconstruction, including both shapes and movements.Fig. 1Development of the DM system.Our approach uses RGB images as input and outputs 3D reconstructed meshes. For a particular frame, the algorithm first extracts 2D face landmarks from the RGB image and fits a set of face model weights for 3D face reconstruction. Then, the algorithm extracts 2D eyelid landmarks and 2D semantic lines and fits eyelid model weights for 3D eyelid reconstruction. Finally, the algorithm extracts 2D iris landmarks and solves eyeball rotation for 3D eyeball reconstruction.",
                        "In 3D reconstruction, we used three predefined parametric models for faces, eyelids and eyeballs. The face model was mathematically a bilinear model17 (Methods) that represented a 3D face as a shape vector wfs and a motion vector wfm. Given a particular wfs and a wfm, the bilinear face model can reconstruct a particular 3D face mesh Mf. The face model can represent the overall geometry of the face, but eye regions lack details. Since the eye regions are important for diagnosis, we used a linear eyelid model18 to represent detailed eye regions. Similar to the face model, given this eyelid model, a detailed eyelid Me (of one eye) was represented by an eye shape vector wes and an eye motion vector wem. To additionally reconstruct the eyeballs, we used the simplified geometry and appearance eyeball model (SGAEM), introduced in our previous study19. The model approximated eyeballs as spheres and used three parameters, the eyeball radius re, the iris radius ri and the position pe relative to the face, to represent the static properties of an eyeball and the eyeball rotation in polar coordinates to represent eyeball motion.",
                        "Deep-learning techniques were leveraged to extract facial features that were used to infer the aforementioned model parameters to obtain the facial reconstruction results. First, a pretrained neural network was used as a face landmark detector to extract two-dimensional (2D) face landmarks Lface from an input red, green and blue color space (RGB) image. With the landmarks Lface, we estimated the face pose T (rotation and translation), face shape vector wfs and face motion vector wfm by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the 2D landmarks Lface and the 2D projections of the corresponding points on the 3D face Mf. Second, an eyelid landmark detector was used to extract 2D eyelid landmarks Leyelid and an eyelid semantic line detector was used to extract 2D eyelid semantic lines Seyelid. These two detectors were also neural networks trained by deep-learning techniques. Then, we similarly estimated the eyelid shape vector wes and the eyelid motion vector wem by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the 2D landmarks Leyelid and the projections of the corresponding points on the eyelid mesh Me, as well as by making the projected points on the semantic lines close to the detected semantic lines Seyelid on the image. Here, semantic lines provided rich and continuous information on the eyelid area, while landmarks were robust discrete features for tracking eyelid motions. Combining these two types of features made the reconstruction more accurate and stable. Finally, for the eyeballs, we trained another neural network as an iris landmark detector to extract 2D iris landmarks Liris from the input RGB image. As the eyeball radius re, iris radius ri and relative position pe were invariant in a video, we predicted them in the first frame and then fixed them in the following video frames. Per-frame eyeball rotations were estimated by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the 2D landmarks Liris and the projections of the corresponding points on the SGAEM. The DM included optional operations for adapting to different clinical applications, such as dealing with eye occlusion in videos recording the alternate cover test or reconstructing eyebrow movements in diagnosing ocular diseases."

In the quantitative evaluation, the performance of the DM was measured by the 2D normalized pixel error, with lower numbers indicating better reconstruction performance. We first acquired the Euclidean distance between the landmarks in DM-reconstructed videos and the corresponding landmarks in original videos (Fig. 2a). The pixel errors between landmarks were then normalized by the pixel distance between the centers of the two eyes.Fig. 2Quantitative evaluation of the digital mask.a, Schematic indicating how the Euclidean error was calculated. For both eyeball and eyelid reconstruction, we project the 3D points to 2D image space (yellow) and calculate the Euclidean pixel distance between them and landmarks in the original video (red).

The heat map of the normalized pixel errors in images of patients with the abovementioned four diseases is shown in Fig. 2c. The normalized pixel errors remained small and stable most of the time, with slight fluctuations when the eyes were looking down, thus indicating the precise reconstruction of the DM."

                        "To evaluate the performance of the DM in clinical practice, we performed a relevant diagnostic comparison and an identity-removal validation. In the relevant diagnostic comparison, 12 ophthalmologists, 3 from each of the four departments, were invited to diagnose patients from their departments based on the DM-reconstructed videos and original videos. We evaluated the videos regarding pathological ocular manifestations that caused changes in the appearance of the eye and patients were diagnosed visually with diseases, including (1) TAO (exophthalmos, eyelid retraction and overactive or underactive extraocular muscles); (2) strabismus (horizontal or vertical strabismus and compensatory head position); (3) ptosis (drooping or lowering of the upper eyelid); and (4) nystagmus (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video)9. For each eye, both the independent diagnosis from the original videos and the diagnosis from the DM-reconstructed videos were recorded and compared (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 1). If the two diagnoses were excellently consistent, this would suggest that the reconstruction was precise enough for use in clinical practice. Cohen\u2019s \u03ba values showed very high consistency (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.845\u20130.934 for strabismus, ptosis and nystagmus on both eyes and \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.801 for TAO on right eyes) of the diagnoses, made by three ophthalmologists under majority rule, from original and reconstructed videos for all comparisons (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Table 2). Additionally, the accuracies of the diagnoses from the original and reconstructed videos, compared to the ground truth, were comparable for all paired comparisons (P\u2009=\u20090.131\u20131; Extended Data Table 3). These results indicate that the DM retains the important clinical attributes correctly and has the potential to be adopted in clinical practice.Fig. 3Clinical signs of the ocular diseases studied.Main clinical signs (top) for diagnosis of each ocular disease studied are shown using schematic diagram, the original facial image, the image of the DM and the overlap between the original facial image and the DM. See Supplementary Video for details. More diverse secondary clinical signs of the four diseases are shown (bottom).Fig. 4Clinical validation of the DM.a, Workflow of relevant diagnostic comparisons using the original videos and the corresponding DM-reconstructed videos. Participants were recruited from four outpatient departments after having been diagnosed by a specialist as having TAO, ptosis, strabismus, nystagmus or none of these. Once the participants were enrolled in the study, facial videos of appropriate ocular examinations were taken. Each video was independently used by three ophthalmologists from each of the four departments for making a diagnosis. A dichotomous diagnosis of abnormal or not was made for both the left eye and the right eye. Both the original video and DM video from the same participant were used by the same ophthalmologist for diagnosis, performed in a blinded fashion using the participant number (ID-1 to ID-n; TAO, n\u2009=\u2009102; strabismus, n\u2009=\u2009100; ptosis, n\u2009=\u2009111; and nystagmus, n\u2009=\u200992). b, Line plots indicating diagnostic consistency for the indicated ocular diseases (Cohen\u2019s \u03ba\u2009\u2265\u20090.81 indicates perfect consistent). c, Left, workflow for identity removal validation in which the identity removal abilities of the DM and those of image cropping were compared. Respondents were given six options, including five facial images and an \u2018other\u2019 option. From these options, the respondents were asked to choose the original image corresponding to the DM-reconstructed image or cropped image. Red indicates an incorrect answer; green indicates a correct answer. Accuracy of identity removal validation (right). Results were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d. Each scatter-point represents the score of one set calculated from one respondent, with ten questions per set and a total score of 100. For each disease, 20 sets of questions (10 of DM and 10 of cropped) were taken.",
                        "In the identity-removal validation, we compared the identity-removal ability of the DM with that of cropping by using multiple-choice questions. Specifically, we processed the original images of the faces of the patients by using DM and cropping to generate 400 DM-reconstructed images and 400 cropped images, respectively. The selected generated images and the original images were staggered in the video time sequence. Correspondingly, we designed 800 multiple-choice questions. For the DM test, each question contained a DM-reconstructed image and five original images. For the cropping test, each question contained a cropped image and five original images. For each question, there were six options, including the five original images and an \u2018other\u2019 option. From these options, the respondents were asked to find the original image corresponding to the DM-reconstructed image or cropped image. The results showed that the accuracy rate for those taking the DM test was 27.3%; however, the accuracy for those taking the cropping was 91.3%, which was much greater than the accuracy of those taking the DM test (Fig. 4c). Both accuracies were likely overestimated because the test was conducted on the premise that the respondent knew only five people. In actual situations, the numbers of people are far higher; however, the results still demonstrate that the DM can effectively remove patient identity attributes and protect patient privacy, especially compared to cropping.",
                        "In addition, to evaluate the willingness of patients to share their eye and facial images during the application of DM, we performed an empirical investigation. 3D reconstruction software was developed to which users could provide their videos anonymously. The videos were then automatically processed by the DM and delivered to clinicians. Clinicians were only allowed to watch the DM-reconstructed videos for diagnosis (Supplementary Video) and the diagnoses were fed back to the users. A total of 317 outpatients, randomly selected via clinics, agreed to participate in the empirical investigation. During the investigation, the participants were asked to watch uploaded videos and the corresponding reconstructed videos processed by the DM using the software. The patients then completed a questionnaire to investigate their willingness to use DM at the end of the investigation (Fig. 5a). Among the respondents, 161 were males (50.7%). By age group, the highest proportion of respondents was in the 20\u201330-year group. Most of the respondents had university degrees (82.3%) and had used smartphones for more than 7 years (73.8%). In addition, in the questionnaire, regarding five hypotheses, 16 questions were designed from five aspects, including health support, privacy concerns, trust in physicians and medical platforms, willingness to share information and the influences of DM (Fig. 5b). The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and Cronbach \u03b1 values for each component were larger than 0.617 and 0.718, respectively, thus supporting the reliability and validity of each question in the research design. Approximately 80% of the participants agreed that they had privacy concerns. Among the participants who had a disease with facial signs, more than 81.4% had privacy concerns, compared to more than 74.4% of participants without facial signs. Furthermore, we assessed the significance of the influence of the major aspects.Fig. 5Empirical investigation of the willingness of patients to share personal health information.a, Schematic of the hypothesis. Patients\u2019 trust in physicians and medical platforms was hypothesized to be positively affected by perceived benefits, such as health support of digital health information (H1) and negatively affected by perceived concerns, such as privacy concerns (H2). The DM was hypothesized to have a positive impact on such trust (H3) and further improved patients\u2019 willingness to share information (H4). b, Questionnaire results. In the questionnaire, 16 questions were designed with respect to the five hypotheses; the responses were further measured using five-point scales ranging from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019. The percentages of the responses to each item are shown (right).",
                        "As shown in Extended Data Table 4, perceived benefits, such as health support of digital health information, positively affected patients\u2019 trust in physicians and medical platforms with respect to digital health (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.465, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

In the validation, we conducted face recognition attacks by using three well-known deep-learning systems, namely, FaceNet20, CosFace21 and ArcFace22. All the systems were trained on the CASIA-WebFace Dataset23, which contains 494,414 face images of 10,575 real identities collected from the web. Using 405 patient videos, we randomly selected two frames in each video; one of the frames was used as the query image and the other was used as the database image. We processed 405 original query images to further generate 405 cropped query images and 405 DM-reconstructed query images. For the test, given a query image (original images, cropped images or DM-reconstructed images), the face recognition system (FaceNet, CosFace or ArcFace) was asked to match the image with database images of 405 patients. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.1 (TAR, true accept rate; FAR, false accept rate), TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.01 and Rank-1 to evaluate the face recognition performance. The lower values of TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.1, TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.01 and Rank-1 indicate the weaker performance of the face recognition system and the greater performance of the privacy protection technology. As shown in Fig. 6b and Extended Data Table 5, the results on all the measurements show that taking original images as the query images, it was easy for face recognition systems to match the correct identity. When taking cropped images as the query images, the metrics had limited degradation. When using the DM, the performance of face recognition was significantly degraded. Rank-1 was <0.02 for all three systems, indicating that the systems had a very low possibility of identifying the correct identity with the DM-reconstructed images. Meanwhile, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of using DM-reconstructed images were close to y\u2009=\u2009x for all three systems, indicating that it was impossible to keep high TAR with low FAR. These results show the superiority in terms of privacy protection of our DM technique.Fig. 6Validation of the DM using AI-powered re-identification algorithms.a, Study workflow. The re-identification algorithms were used to find the ID of the patient from a database of 405 patients when given the original image, a cropped image or the DM-reconstructed image of a patient as a query image. b, Performance of the three re-identification algorithms tested, as assessed by TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.1, TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.01, Rank-1 (left) and ROC curves (right). The re-identification algorithms were trained on the CASIA-Webface dataset. TAR@FAR\u2009=\u2009X indicates the TAR when the FAR equals X. Rank-1 is the probability that the similarity score of the same identity ranks first among all the identities. Lower values of TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.1, TAR@FAR\u2009=\u20090.01 and Rank-1 indicate weaker performance of the re-identification algorithm and better performance of the privacy protection technology.

Experimental results support that with the DM, examination videos of patients with manifestations of ocular disease can be precisely reconstructed from 2D videos containing original faces. A clinical diagnosis comparison showed that ophthalmologists achieved high consistency in reaching the same diagnosis when using the original videos and the corresponding DM-reconstructed videos. This new technology could effectively remove identity attributes and was positively accepted by patients with ocular diseases, who expressed an increasing willingness to share their personal information and have it stored digitally with this added layer of biometric protection.",
                "It is notable that the DM offers a pragmatic approach to safeguarding patient privacy and data utilization in both research and clinical settings; patient privacy and data utilization are frequently cited as concerns by patients worried about data breaches. Compared to rather crude but still widely used options, such as covering identifiable areas with very large bars or cropping these areas out altogether3, the DM is a much more sophisticated tool for anonymizing facial images. Even next-generation privacy-protection techniques, such as federated learning and homomorphic encryption, do not safeguard privacy well and crucially, these techniques are vulnerable to model inversion or reconstruction attacks24. The DM selects relevant features for reconstruction, but it is impossible to reconstruct original data particularly relevant to patient identification. Furthermore, compared with other face-swapping technologies, the DM can obtain quantitative parameters (such as the degree of eyeball rotation, eyelid shape parameters, blinking rate and rotation frequency), which might prove essential in the future for intelligent diagnosing disease or studying the relationships between diseases and certain facial characteristics.",
                "In addition to its potential utilization in research and routine clinical practice, the DM can be applied to telemedicine, including online automatic diagnosis and patient triage for more efficient healthcare delivery25. The wider adoption of digital medicine, partly prompted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, will require that the barriers to privacy protection be overcome and an important step is removing biometric data that are not essential for healthcare delivery. The DM can encrypt data before they are submitted to the cloud, thereby allowing clinicians or AI algorithms to review the reconstructed data and removing concerns of patients whose medical records contain sensitive biometric data26.",
                "However, \u2018protecting privacy\u2019 does not equate to \u2018absolute removal of identity characteristics.\u2019 According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, protecting patient privacy refers to reducing the identification risk of health information27. One of the most important principles is balancing disclosure risk against data utility. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an approach to health information disclosure that de-identifies protected health information as much as possible, without compromising the need for the clinician to reach a diagnosis.",
                "The study has several limitations. First, the reconstruction of conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema and abnormal growth of tissues, such as ocular tumors, remains challenging because of insufficient model capacity. Model-based 3D reconstruction assumes that the target lies in the linear space spanned based on a set of prepared models; however, it is difficult to cover all shapes in the aforementioned cases because shapes differ significantly from person to person. We intend to improve the DM by including a sufficiently large sample of abnormal cases for more detailed analysis or constructing an extra submodel on top of the existing model in the next research step. Second, this paper has demonstrated that the DM can protect re-identification from images but it may not work under certain circumstances if the video of the patient is exposed. We are currently extending our work to deal with video protection and circumvent this possible weakness. Third, the potential risk that the DM might be attacked still remains, as it might be abused to develop targeted attack algorithms; however, this risk can be mitigated by formulating relevant rules in the future.",
                "In conclusion, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DM in enhancing patient data privacy by making use of deep learning and real-time 3D reconstruction and notably, we demonstrate the DM\u2019s acceptability to healthcare users. Future work is necessary to further evaluate the applicability of DM in a wider variety of clinical settings as the requirements for de-identification will vary according to the type of imaging dataset used."

Cohen\u2019s \u03ba statistics were used to evaluate the diagnostic consistency in the relevant diagnostic comparison. Kappa was interpreted as recommended by Landis and Koch, where \u03ba\u2009\u2264\u20090.00 is considered as poor, 0.00\u20130.20 as slight, 0.21\u20130.40 as fair, 0.41\u20130.60 as moderate, 0.61\u20130.80 as substantial and \u22650.81 almost perfect42. In addition, based on the groundtruth, we measured the accuracies of diagnoses from the original videos and diagnoses from the reconstructed videos and compared them using the McNemar test. In the empirical investigation, principal-component analysis was used to generate five factors from the 16 questions in the questionnaire. The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin measure of the sampling adequacy and Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for each component were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of each question. Linear regression was used to measure the associations between components.",

The TAR is the proportion of authorized people who the system correctly accepts and is defined as\\(\\begin{matrix} {TAR = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}} \\end{matrix}\\)",

The AUC measures the 2D area underneath the ROC curve. TAR@FAR\u2009=\u2009X represents the TAR value when FAR equals X. Rank-1 is the probability that the similarity score of the same identity ranks first among all the identities.",
