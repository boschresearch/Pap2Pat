Digital treatment is a new approach to integrating an information technology into the whole treatment process. However, digital treatment brings about some problems, for example, how to protect privacy of a patient. How to better protect the privacy of a patient becomes an urgent problem to be resolved. Currently, because facial information digitally shows disease signs, and inevitably reserves sensitive biometric identification information, how to precisely distinguish sensitive biometric identification information from facial information is a major technical difficulty in the field of face privacy protection.",

The examination video may be obtained when pathological features of a patient are acquired by using a camera device, where the examination video is generally a color video, and the examination video includes the pathological features and  non-pathological features of a face.",

Extract image features of each frame of images in the examination video, perform region division on each frame of the images according to position information of organs in the image features, and obtain a region to be precisely reconstructed and a region to be roughly reconstructed according to a region division result.",

The image features include position information of organs of a face, such as position information of eyes, position information of eyebrows, position information of a nose, and position information of a mouth. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, each frame of the images is divided into a plurality of image regions according to the position information, and a region to be precisely reconstructed and a region to be roughly reconstructed are then obtained in the image regions in combination with case features required for a disease of an ophthalmic patient. It should be noted that the region to be precisely reconstructed includes main pathological features for diagnosing an ophthalmic disease, mainly including morphology and motion features of eyeballs and eyelids. The region to be roughly reconstructed includes features that are not related to the eye disease and identification features that are less related to the eye disease, such as a nose and a mouth. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, a region to be precisely reconstructed and a region to be roughly reconstructed are obtained according to the region division result, so that when three-dimensional (3D) face reconstruction with different precision is subsequently performed according to the region to be precisely reconstructed and the region to be roughly reconstructed, most of identification features of the ophthalmic patient can be covered while reserving most of case features of the ophthalmic patient, thereby protecting the privacy of the ophthalmic patient without affecting doctor's diagnosis.",
