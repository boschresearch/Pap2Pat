    "title": "Transition from static culture to stirred tank bioreactor for the allogeneic production of therapeutic discogenic cell spheres",
    "date": "2021-08-12",
    "abstract": "Background Culturing cells as cell spheres results in a tissue-like environment that drives unique cell phenotypes, making it useful for generating cell populations intended for therapeutic use. Unfortunately, common methods that utilize static suspension culture have limited scalability, making commercialization of such cell therapies challenging. Our team is developing an allogeneic cell therapy for the treatment of lumbar disc degeneration comprised of discogenic cells, which are progenitor cells expanded from human nucleus pulposus cells that are grown in a sphere configuration. Methods We evaluate sphere production in Erlenmeyer, horizontal axis wheel, stirred tank bioreactor, and rocking bag format. We then explore the use of ramped agitation profiles and computational fluid dynamics to overcome obstacles related to cell settling and the undesired impact of mechanical forces on cell characteristics. Finally, we grow discogenic cells in stirred tank reactors (STRs) and test outcomes in vitro (potency via aggrecan production and identity) and in vivo (rabbit model of disc degeneration). Results Computation fluid dynamics were used to model hydrodynamic conditions in STR systems and develop statistically significant correlations to cell attributes including potency (measured by aggrecan production), cell doublings, cell settling, and sphere size. Subsequent model-based optimization and testing resulted in growth of cells with comparable attributes to the original static process, as measured using both in vitro and in vivo models. Maximum shear rate (1/s) was maintained between scales to demonstrate feasibility in a 50 L STR (200-fold scale-up). Conclusions Transition of discogenic cell production from static culture to a stirred-tank bioreactor enables cell sphere production in a scalable format. This work shows significant progress towards establishing a large-scale bioprocess methodology for this novel cell therapy that can be used for other, similar cell therapies.",

                "Allogeneic cell-based therapies have the potential to treat many conditions impacting large numbers of patients, each using a single source of cells. While techniques to generate the cells vary, one approach is to use cell sphere-forming culture methods that result in a three-dimensional, tissue-like environment. Current methods for this type of culture are small in scale and rely on complex or labor-intensive strategies [1, 2]. As such, developing scalable manufacturing platforms for cell spheres is essential to ensuring successful translation of such cell-based therapies into a commercial setting. This development is especially important if the therapy is intended to address large patient populations, such as those experiencing disc degeneration in the spine.",
                "Disc degeneration is a major cause of low back pain, which is a leading cause of disability worldwide [3]. Patients with symptomatic disc degeneration who fail standard non-operative management have few therapeutic options. Some undergo fusion surgery, which has mixed outcomes [4, 5]. Approaches such as small molecules and biomaterials have demonstrated lack of efficacy and safety issues in clinical trials. Accordingly, novel treatments are needed to address this unmet medical need [6\u20138]. Cell therapy is a promising approach for this condition, where a live cell population is injected into the painful disc to drive new matrix production and minimize pain through active secretion of chemokines, extracellular matrix and other factors [9]. While a few clinical trials have been performed with cell therapies in the disc, none have shown robust efficacy and therefore, further research is needed to identify a suitable cell type [9].",
                "One potential source of cells is nucleus pulposus tissue, the central portion of the intervertebral disc, from human donors. However, the prospect of this cell type for therapeutic purposes has historically been limited by its poor scale-up potential and subsequent inability to meet the need for large numbers of doses to treat patients, coupled with a loss of potency during outgrowth. In previous studies, cells derived from nucleus pulposus tissue were shown not to grow well in vitro and exhibit minimal matrix production [10, 11]. Our group has developed a method to overcome these two issues through a unique multi-week growth process that includes specific media components and culture conditions, resulting in a homogeneous cell population that we call Discogenic Cells, which are distinct from native nucleus pulposus cells and also produce extracellular aggrecan [12]. In preclinical animal models of disc degeneration, the Discogenic Cells showed restoration of disc height and normalization of tissue architecture, which we hypothesize will provide a potential benefit to human patients experiencing disc degeneration [12, 13]. Two double-blinded clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate Discogenic Cells in humans to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of this allogeneic cell therapy in the United States (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03347708) and Japan (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03955315).",
                "Discogenic Cells used in preclinical studies and the ongoing clinical trials were produced using a static suspension culture that was manipulated using manual processes. For harvest, pooling individual flasks was required to achieve the desired lot size. The flasks contained a viscous, methylcellulose-based scaffold in the media to prevent cell adhesion to the flask surface and promote sphere growth, which drives the unique phenotype of Discogenic Cells seen at the end of the culture process [12]. Some other regenerative cell therapies also grow cells in sphere configuration because the three-dimensional tissue mimics endogenous tissue more closely than attachment or single cell suspension environments [1, 2, 12, 14\u201317]. However, for all of these applications, large-scale production is hindered by limitations caused by magnetic levitation, scaffolds, or viscous carriers [1, 2].",
                "In contrast, our group decided to explore other scalable modalities such as stirred tank bioreactors (STRs), flasks with internal waterwheels, Erlenmeyer shake flasks, and wave rocking bioreactors. These systems still maintain suspension of cell spheres through motion caused by rocking or internally moving parts, therefore eliminating scaffold-related complications. We tested each of these modalities before selecting the STR as a platform technology. We sought to maintain the attributes of cell growth, sphere size, extracellular matrix production (specifically, aggrecan production), and flow cytometry identity through the transition from static to STR culture. One issue specific to growing progenitor cells in STRs is the potential for undesired cell characteristics imparted by mechanical forces [18\u201321]. Therefore, we used Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to understand and optimize the STR parameters in an effort to meet the original process attributes. Finally, we performed an exploratory 200-fold scale-up in STR for large-scale production of Discogenic Cells. Successful scale-up of manufacturing is a key step towards enabling large-scale production of a cell therapy that ultimately can address the unmet medical need around disc degeneration and low back pain. Further, the findings may enable other cell therapies produced by cell sphere formation to address therapeutic areas outside of orthopedics."

The cells grown in the static culture generated typical Discogenic Cell spheres (Fig.\u00a01a). Cells grown in the waterwheels (3.87 doublings, SE 0.01) formed into long sheets of cells which trailed the wheel and built up in the vessel corners (Fig.\u00a01b). Cells grown in Erlenmeyer shake flasks had similar doublings relative to the original static culture controls (100 RPM: 3.48\u2009\u00d7\u2009doublings, SE 0.23; 130 RPM: 3.58 doublings, SE 0.18), but spheres were not generated and cells attached to the vessel walls and formed into clumps (Fig.\u00a01c). Cell clumping was most egregious in the wave reactor where large rafts of cells formed (1.67 doublings, SE 1.46) (Fig.\u00a01d).Fig. 1Investigated culture modalities. a Cells grown in a static suspension culture CellSTACK modality with methylcellulose exhibit the desired sphere phenotype. b Cells grown in waterwheel form into sheets rather than spheres. c Cells grown in Erlenmeyer flasks attach to vessel wall rather than in suspension. d Cells grown in Wave Bioreactor Bag form large rafts rather than spheres. e Cells form spheres when grown at low agitation in STR, however large spheres grow too large in size causing issues with oxygen transport and settling out of solution. f A large portion of cells grown at low agitation in STR attach to vessel surfaces impacting growth dynamics. g Cells grown at high agitation speeds in STR show some sphere growth but predominantly form single cells. h Using a ramped agitation profile with low initial RPM and high final RPM we are able to grow spheres in STR and limit cell attachment",
                        "In the 0.25L STR, cells grown at the low RPM setting formed spheres. However, spheres grew too large in size (Fig.\u00a01e) causing issues with spheres settling out of solution (Fig.\u00a01f); the medium and high RPM settings resulted in limited sphere formation (Fig.\u00a01g). Doublings were consistently higher in the STR than in the original static suspension culture (75 RPM\u2009=\u20094.64 doublings, 100 RPM\u2009=\u20096.64 doublings, 125 RPM\u2009=\u20098.4 doublings, 150 RPM\u2009=\u20098.4 doublings, 175 RPM\u2009=\u20096.88 doublings, 200 RPM\u2009=\u20097.73 doublings). Because spheres formed at the low and medium RPM in the 0.25L STR, relative doublings were twice that of static suspension culture controls, and due to the potential for scalability, the STR modality was chosen for further optimization."

                        "Next, an experiment employing twenty-two DASbox was run to evaluate different agitation strategies. No reactors run at a single RPM for the duration of culture enabled sphere growth while simultaneously limiting attachment to vessel walls. In contrast, when RPM was ramped over the course of the culture, we saw that small spheres successfully formed at the beginning of the run and then grow without settling. The ramped agitation allowed for sphere formation which visually resembled spheres from our static culture modality (Fig.\u00a01h).",
                        "The data generated from these runs were used for CFD modeling of 8 different agitation rates. Hydrodynamic parameters were found to vary differently as a function of RPM (Fig.\u00a02a). At the same scale but different RPM, average energy dissipation (m2/s3) and power per unit volume (W/m3) resulted in exponential curves whereas maximum shear rate (1/s), average shear rate (1/s), volume average velocity (m/s) and tip speed (m/s) had linear slopes. In each case the slope was different, indicating that the various hydrodynamic conditions do not scale equally based on RPM. By modeling aggrecan expression from the 22 DASbox reactors with the various hydrodynamic conditions, we found that maximum shear rate (1/s) had the highest correlation with aggrecan expression (p\u2009=\u20090.012) (Fig.\u00a02b).Fig. 2Variation in hydrodynamic conditions. a CFD models show that hydrodynamic conditions scale with different slopes and curvature based on RPM increase in STR, b by running STR at various conditions and then modelling aggrecan results using the various hydrodynamic slopes, we are able to see max shear rate (1/s) has the strongest correlation between our investigated hydrodynamic conditions and aggrecan expression (p\u2009=\u20090.012)",
                        "The CFD model of various agitation profiles showed us which metrics impact cell growth in STR (Fig.\u00a03a). As previously described, max shear rate (1/s) impacted aggrecan production (p\u2009=\u20090.012), along with cell doublings (p\u2009=\u20090.018) (Fig.\u00a03b). Also, cell settling was impacted by the cell volume fraction, meaning cell spheres would fall out of solution as predicted by average eddy turbulence dissipation (p\u2009=\u20090.024) (Fig.\u00a03c). Ultimately, sphere size was impacted by the use of dynamic agitation, where the use of a ramping vs static agitation scheme significantly correlated with sphere sizes (p\u2009=\u20090.033) (Fig.\u00a03d). With these findings, new set-points were identified for the DASbox which we predicted would produce Discogenic Cells with comparable properties to cells grown in static culture.Fig. 3CFD models to enable sphere growth. a Correlation between hydrodynamic conditions and cell outputs include models of max shear rate and aggrecan (p\u2009=\u20090.012), average eddy turbulence dissipation and cell settling (p\u2009=\u20090.024), max shear rate and doublings (p\u2009=\u20090.018), and dynamic agitation with sphere size (p\u2009=\u20090.033). b Illustration of shifts in hydrodynamic environment as RPM shifts in dynamic culture conditions.

Following the initial injury, X-ray analysis showed that the disc height index decreased by\u00a025\u201350%.

In contrast, the discs injected with cell therapy had a more normal appearance in these parameters\u00a0(Fig.\u00a05c). Dorsal cartilage and osteophyte formation were noted but unassociated with treatment condition and are attributed to the injury model. No inflammation\u00a0(as noted by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates) was noted that may have been caused by the cell therapy. Also, the new vehicle\u00a0(which contains the original excipients minus one in different concentrations) did not result in any abnormal findings.

Also, scale-up maintaining average shear rate (1/s) would result in an extremely high RPM that would prevent sphere formation and promote cell death. Scale-up based on power per unit volume (W/m3), maximum shear rate (1/s), and volume average velocity (m/s) all should limit cell settling while allowing sphere formation. Of these hydrodynamic conditions, maximum shear rate (1/s) was chosen to scale into the 50 L because it had the strongest correlation with aggrecan expression.",

Although the aggrecan value for the 0.25L was higher (2480 picograms/ml/day, SE 210) than the 50L (1540 picograms/ml/day), all aggrecan measurements were below the qualified limit of quantification making interpretation of differences inappropriate (Fig.\u00a06d).

            "paragraphs": [
                "Cell sphere production is primarily performed in static, small-scale systems that are unsuitable for large-scale industrialization [1, 2]. The purpose of this work was to transition into a scalable system while maintaining the desirable attributes of the cells established in the static suspension, small-scale systems. To begin our work, we tested our ability to grow cell spheres without a scaffold in wave reactors, Erlenmeyer shake flasks, PBS waterwheels, and STRs. Out of all the modalities tested, the STR was the most promising. With optimization and modeling of hydrodynamic profiles, we were able to understand the impact of maximum shear rate (s\u22121) on our cells and found the appropriate agitation rates necessary to maintain cell attributes in STRs.",
                "Optimizing agitation is a major obstacle in enabling cell sphere culture in STRs [19, 24]. In the STR modality, the run begins by inoculating vessels with a single-cell suspension. Then, these cells expand into progressively larger cell spheres. As the number of cells in each aggregate increases, the mass and buoyancy of the spheres shift. If the agitation setpoint is too low, the cells fall out of solution and attach to the bottom of the vessel. If the agitation is too high, the shear forces prevent cells from forming into spheres and ultimately the cells do not exhibit the desired characteristics. Thus, the goal is to identify an agitation scheme that allows for sphere formation without settling, and this changes as the spheres grow. We found that a ramped agitation scheme enabled sphere formation at the beginning of the run and limited cell settling throughout the run. The use of ramped agitation to keep the Discogenic Cell spheres in suspension differs from the predominate use of magnetic levitation or viscous carriers to grow cell spheres described previously [1, 21, 25].",
                "The optimal conditions identified in our hydrodynamic condition investigations were used for subsequent split stream growth between the original small scale static suspension modality and 0.25L STR suspension methods. Because cell phenotype is impacted by the mechanical, physical and chemical local environment, and the transition from a static culture to a bioreactor includes some significant environmental changes experienced by the cells, it was important to verify that cells grown in STR still resulted in Discogenic Cells with the same final attributes [18, 20, 21, 26]. Both in vitro and in vivo assessments were performed. We found that cells grown in static culture and 0.25L STR exhibited similar doublings, identity, aggrecan production and bioactivity in vivo, measured by increased disc height in rabbit disc degeneration model, as previously seen for Discogenic Cells [12]. To ensure comparability between the pre-clinical and clinical cells, xenograft was successfully used in this model as demonstrated by a lack visual evidence for immune rejection, perhaps due to the avascular nature of the disc making it immune-privileged [27]. Given the xenogeneic nature of this injection, a future study could include tracing the cells to determine the longevity in the disc.",
                "CFD played a key role in aiding the transition into STR and increasing scale by allowing for the efficient optimization of STR parameters. Given the significant expense of running larger volumes of STR, we sought to minimize the number of experiments needed to successfully generate Discogenic Cells. The purpose of maintaining consistent hydrodynamic conditions across modalities and scales is to maintain a similar cell phenotype because hydrodynamic conditions can affect cell differentiation [18, 28\u201331]. While many hydrodynamic parameters could be used to scale, we found through CFD modeling that Max Shear Rate (1/s) best correlates with aggrecan production and cell doublings for Discogenic Cells, and therefore was most suitable to use for the transition. Aggrecan is believed to be a key element contributing to the potency of this cell therapy, through deposition of tissue commonly found within the disc. Another important finding from CFD that was used in the transition was to control cell volume fraction, which was used to inform what minimum RPM would avoid cell settling. Our modeling suggested that if 3 out of 6 investigated hydrodynamic conditions had been used, instead of Max Shear Rate, the runs would have failed even with ramped agitation. Therefore, the extra modeling effort helped guide the scale-up effort in a useful way to avoid costly, failed runs.",
                "At the 50L scale we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of our scale up strategy generating similar sphere sizes, cell doublings and identity, to the 0.25L scale (Fig.\u00a06). This shows that our use of ramped agitation and maintaining max shear rate between scales has the potential to yield similar results across scales. Cell doublings from this scale up run (4.86 doublings for all conditions) were significantly higher than the previous study where we compared growth in STR (cell doublings\u2009=\u20092.57, SE\u2009=\u20090.39) to the original static suspension method (cell doublings\u2009=\u20092.38, SE\u2009=\u20090.48). However, aggrecan expression was below the qualified limit of quantification at both scales which restricts our ability for meaningful comparison. Because both conditions had low aggrecan values, and we demonstrated successful aggrecan production across 8 other donor cell lines (Fig.\u00a04d), we cannot assume these low values are caused by hydrodynamic conditions. Instead, we hypothesize that cell proliferation may have an inverse correlation to ECM production in our culture. These discrepancies show that future donor, process, and media characterization may be necessary for successful and consistent aggrecan production at any scale. Due to our low sample size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200950L STR additional studies are a prerequisite for drawing any significant conclusions about scale-up.",
                "While we used aggrecan production to guide our CFD models, other parameters could be used in the future as well. We have demonstrated that other molecules, such as collagen and anti-inflammatory molecules are also relevant to the mode of action of Discogenic Cells in treating lumbar disc degeneration [12, 32]. Further work is needed to evaluate these potency measures in the context of transitioning to a STR and scaling into larger volumes. Ultimately, the data shown for Discogenic Cells grown in a 50 L STR represents a successful proof of concept, and additional studies are needed to further develop optimal process setpoints such as pH, DO, cell, and density which will be further guided by additional potency parameters as well as further understanding of the key mode of action.",
                "Stirred tank bioreactor as a platform technology grants the ability for real time monitoring of cell conditions (pH, DO, etc.) at bench and manufacturing scales, as well as enabling process-controlled scale-up. There is also significant precedence for using STR in approved pharmaceutical products, and equipment can be purchased from many different vendors. For the 50 L STR work, we utilized a Thermo Fisher Scientific TruBio controller that is a DeltaV based automation system for the SUB (STR). It was selected because it is a proven industrial platform for biomanufacturing and supports advanced features important to the long-term success and commercialization of this therapy, such as advanced process analytics, recipe customization, streamlined tech-transfer tools, and meeting cGMP level integrity requirements.",
                "We are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of Discogenic Cells mixed with a viscous carrier in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc degeneration. The original static suspension process used to produce the cells for the clinical trial must be updated to allow for automation and scale-up, which can suitably meet market demand and compliance for cGMP manufacturing. Generally, cell therapies face manufacturing challenges as products advance beyond clinical trials and enter wide-spread usage. The manufacturing processes for commercial-scale products must be automated, data must be accessible, and larger scale must be successfully utilized. We can utilize well-established bioprocess equipment such as STRs, but must apply novel approaches to scale-up due to the highly sensitive nature of primary human cell lines. CFD was a useful tool in establishing suitable parameters for growing Discogenic Cells in an STR and informing preliminary scale-up parameters. Ultimately, this work advances our efforts to treat painful lumbar disc degeneration and provides a process development framework to utilize in the generation of future cell therapy products."
