                        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized, membrane-bound vesicles that are released from cells and typically contain messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs), microRNAs, other non-coding RNAs, deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), proteins, and lipids, and can server as endogenous delivery vehicles for cell-to-cell communication. Different EV types include microvesicles (MVs), exosomes, oncosomes, and apoptotic bodies. MVs bud from the plasma membrane, are about 100 nm to 1 \u03bcm in diameter, and contain cytoplasmic cargo. Exosomes are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and have diameters of about 40 to 120 nm. Oncosomes are large EVs (about 1 to about 10 \u03bcm in diameter) generated from membrane protrusions, which are produced primarily by malignant cells. Dying cells release vesicular apoptotic bodies (about 50 nm to about 2 \u03bcm in diameter) that are typically more plentiful in the body than exosomes or MVs and can vary in content between different biofluids.",
                        "Tumorigenesis can affect many pathways that regulate the production of EVs and often results in an increased production of EVs by some tumor cells in comparison to normal cells. These tumor-derived EVs often contain a select subset of proteins and nucleic acids that can manipulate their cellular microenvironments at local and distant sites to promote angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. For example, cancer patients frequently show increased concentrations of EVs in their circulation, which allows the use of isolated EVs from biofluids as biomarkers for diagnostics and disease monitoring in a non-invasive manner."

The systems and methods disclosed herein can be used to perform target, e.g., tumor-derived, EV isolation with high specificity (e.g., approximately 94%) within a relatively short time period (e.g., 3 hours or less). The systems can include a microfluidic device with channels (e.g., \u201cmicro-channels\u201d) with one or more surfaces that are coated with binding moieties, e.g., antibodies, to capture target EVs selectively from a fluid sample (e.g., human serum or plasma).

In some instances, target EVs that are captured in the microfluidic device can be released to enable downstream characterization and functional studies.",

The method includes flowing the fluid sample through a depletion module to remove at least some non-target extracellular vesicles and flowing the fluid sample that exits the depletion module into a capture module. The capture module includes a microfluidic channel where an internal surface of at least one wall of the microfluidic channel comprises a plurality of grooves or ridges, or both grooves and ridges, arranged and configured to generate chaotic mixing within a fluid sample flowing through the microfluidic channel. The capture module also includes a plurality of elongate flexible linker molecules, each having a molecular weight between about 1.8-4.8 kDa, where each elongate flexible linker molecule is bound at a first end to an internal surface of at least one wall of the microfluidic channel and is bound at a second end to one or more binding moieties that specifically bind to a target extracellular vesicle.

Non-target extracellular vesicles are captured in the depletion module.",
                        "The systems and techniques disclosed herein can be used to address many limitations in prior technologies for EV isolation and capture from a fluid sample that often prevent EVs from being widely used in clinical settings. For instance, many EV isolation technologies often rely on techniques (e.g., ultracentrifugation, precipitation processing) that rely on EV physical properties for isolation. However, these techniques often isolate not only target EVs, such as tumor-derived EVs, but also non-target EVs derived from non-malignant cells such as platelets, endothelial cells, and immunological cells. This often yields low throughput outcomes and low specificity. While antibody-coated bead-based assays can be used to improve specific isolation of tumor-derived EVs, these assays often take a relatively long time to complete and can consist of multiple labeling steps. Such assays are also typically not very efficient, as the interactions between the antibody coated beads and EVs are statistically challenging to optimize and can also suffer from steric hindrance effects and could benefit from use of flexible linker molecules as discussed in detail below.",
                        "Moreover, the systems and techniques disclosed herein provide various advantages over other types of microfluidic particle capture systems. For example, a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) technique can be used to sort populations of small nanometer EVs from micrometer-size particles. While a nano-DLD device can achieve a sorting resolution that allows separation between 10 nm to 110 nm populations of exosomes, techniques using the device often lack specificity towards tumor-derived EVs and may miss detection of important biological cargo. Other approaches include the use of plasmonic sensor devices that can immobilize and then quantify EVs. However, these devices are complicated to manufacture and scale up, and usually, operate at low throughput.",
                        "In addition, the microfluidic systems described herein provide improved specificity for capturing target EVs. The target EVs can be captured in channels of microfluidic devices that are coated with surface chemistry specific to the target EVs. As discussed in detail below, the surface chemistry, in some implementations, includes multiple layers of gelatin bonded to the channel surface, nanostructured substrates attached to a top layer of gelatin, and multiple elongated flexible linker molecules, e.g., fixed-length polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, attached to the nanostructured substrates. The addition of the multiple elongated flexible linker molecules enables improve capture of target EVs compared to, for instance, larger sized cells having 10-20 \u03bcm diameters.",
                        "The systems and techniques disclosed herein can also sufficiently distinguish between EVs produced by normal and target cells, such as tumor cells, at high throughputs to allow testing with large volumes of serum or plasma (e.g., 3 to 5 mL). In particular implementations, the systems disclosed herein can be used to capture and isolate tumor-derived EVs from fluid samples of GBM patients. In such implementations, the systems can be used for detection of low abundance molecular signatures of mRNAs, such as EGFRvIII, which has 15% to 20% frequency in GBM patients. The systems can be configured to perform EV isolation without requiring enrichment using anti-tetraspanins markers, which often produces undetermined and low tumor-derived EV enrichment ratios. In this regard, the system disclosed herein can be used for the isolation, capture, and investigation of tumor-derived EVs as disease-specific biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.",
                        "The systems also enable the simple and easy release of captured target EVs from the surface of microfluidic devices in a manner that preserves biological cargo contents of the captured target EVs. For example, in some instances, the system can extract up to approximately 87% of target EVs that are captured on the microfluidic device. The extracted target EVs can analyzed using downstream processing for clinical investigation. As an example, the extracted target EVs can be investigated for pre-metastatic niche formation since EVs from cancer cells of a primary tumor can remotely prepare distant sites for the spread of tumors in an organ-specific manner. As another example, once isolated and extracted, the target EVs can be studied to determine oncogenic transfer potential to other cells, since many tumor-derived EVs are capable of inducing phenotype changes in surrounding cells.",
                        "In some implementations, the systems disclosed herein can be configured to capture EVs of different sizes and are thereby capable of isolating exosomes, microvesicles, and oncosomes that could have significant biological implications with different cargo packaged in EVs based on their mode of biogenesis.",
                        "Moreover, the systems can provide improvements to downstream imaging of target EVs due to the increased sensitivity for capturing target EVs. For example, imaging benefits can be correlated to total RNA yield from EVs that can then facilitate the process of optimization for other types of cancer.",
                        "As used herein, \u201cfunctionalizing\u201d a material or a \u201cfunctionalized\u201d material refers to a modification, e.g., chemical modification, of the material to alter the reactivity of the material. Similarly, functionalizing a surface or a functionalized surface refers to the chemical modification of the surface to alter the reactivity of the surface. For example, the material can be chemically modified by oxidizing, reducing, aminating, or carboxylating one or more chemical functional groups. Functionalizing the surface can include, for example, contacting the surface (e.g., glass) with a chemical compound that introduces amine moieties to the surface. Functionalizing can be performed in one or more chemical reaction steps. A material can be functionalized by reactive contact with one or more functionalizing agents, which can be one or more chemical compounds that react with at least a portion of the hydrogel. For example, biotin-NHS can be bound to primary amines on a gelatin.",

                        "The present disclosure features microfluidic systems that can be used to isolate and capture target EVs from a fluid sample (e.g., bodily fluids such as human serum or plasma) for clinical investigation. The systems include a microfluidic device with channels coated functionalized with antibodies specific to target EVs. The channels include herringbone grooves to induce chaotic mixing to maximize interactions between target EVs in the fluid sample and antibodies immobilized on the surface of the channels. The surface of the channels can also be coated with a thermally responsive nanostructured substrate to allow extraction of capture target EVs for downstream characterization and clinical investigation.",
                        "As discussed below, the microfluidic systems can efficiently capture target EVs from fluid samples. Surfaces of the channels within the microfluidic device can be functionalized with antibody cocktails that allow for specific and rapid isolation of the target EVs. The captured target EVs can subsequently be released to allow analysis of biological cargo. In some instances, the surface of the channel can include nanostructured interfaces and linker molecules of a specified length or weight (e.g., 2.4 kDa) to improve specificity in capturing target EVs.",
                        "As discussed below, the clinical potential of the microfluidic systems was evaluated by identifying EGFRvIII mutations in serum/plasma from GBM patients. RNA sequencing analysis on the captured EVs revealed the presence of more than 50 genes specific to GBMs, as well as a variety of the GBM subtype-identifying mRNAs (neural, pro-neural, mesenchymal, and classical).",
                        "Once target EVs have been captured using the microfluidic device, the captured EVs can then be characterized and/or processed for further clinical investigation. For example, mRNA contained in target EVs captured on the surface of the microfluidic device can be isolated and analyzed as a diagnostic tool for a disease condition associated with the target EVs. As another example, quantitative PCR can be used to quantify the presence of target EVs in a liquid sample.",
                        "The descriptions below initially discuss concepts relating to target EVs and their isolation and capture from fluid samples. Systems and methods that can be used to isolate and capture target EVs from a fluid sample are then discussed. The description then focuses on methods of isolating and analyzing RNA from specific EVs that have been captured using the microfluidic system discussed throughout this disclosure. Downstream processing techniques for analyzing captured specific EVs are then discussed. Experimental results of exemplary implementations of the microfluidic system then further described.",
                        "I. Overview of Extracellular Vesicles",
                        "EVs are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures that includes exosomes and microvesicles originating from the endosomal system or are shed from the plasma membrane. EVs can be present in biological fluids and are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. For example, EVs can be considered as an additional mechanism for intercellular communication, allowing cells to exchange proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Knowledge of the cellular processes that govern extracellular vesicle biology can be essential to shed light on the physiological and pathological functions of these vesicles as well as on clinical applications involving their use and/or analysis.",
                        "Different specific types of EVs can be used as biomarkers of various pathological conditions. For example, identification of EVs produced by tumor cells (i.e., tumor-derived EVs) in a biological sample can be used to diagnose a patient with cancer. Because a biological sample can include different types of EVs, clinical diagnostic techniques based on EV identification and characterization often require the ability to selectively capture and isolate target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by tumor cells) while avoiding capture of non-target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by platelets, EVs produced by normal healthy cells). The specificity of a target EV isolation technique thereby indicates its potential likelihood of being successfully applied as a diagnostic tool.",
                        "Different types of target EVs can captured and isolated depending on the clinical application. For instance, isolation and capture of tumor-derived EVs can be used to identify the presence of tumor cells producing the tumor-derived EVs in a biological sample. As an example, target EVs can represent EVs produced by GBM cells in a sample from a patient with glioblastoma. In other examples, target EVs can represent EVs produced by other types of tumor cells that are associated with different pathological conditions, such as pancreatic, prostate, lung, breast, bladder, liver, and head and neck cancers. Target EVs can also be derived from cells associated with the tumor or tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages, neutrophils, immune cells, and T-cells. Isolation of these cell-specific EVs can help in the identification of patients that will respond to specific treatments, with a direct interest in immunotherapy. Further, these EVs can help to identify patients that are responding to the treatment already administered. Other non-cancer disease states (or injuries) would include cardiac events, stroke, neurological conditions (Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, Traumatic Brain Injury) as well as monitoring mental health and treatment response.",
                        "In other instances, target EVs can represent EVs produced by other types of cells of interest. For example, EVs released from putative donor organs can be used to monitor the \u2018fitness\u2019 of the organs for transplant. All biological cells release EVs, and as such, they can represent a biomarker for overall organ health and state. Examples include cardiac, kidney and liver EVs. Immune response and allergic reactions could also be monitored through EV release from specific cells, while their production in animal products (e.g., cow's milk) help to identify both fertility states as well as a means for quality control of the food source.",
                        "II. Systems for Isolating and Capturing Overview",
                        "The systems and methods disclosed herein improve the specificity of target EV capture and isolation from a biological fluid and thereby address various challenges associated with distinguishing between target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by tumor cells) and non-target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by normal cells).",
                        "While this disclosure references tumor-derived EVs as target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by GBM cells), these descriptions are intended to be exemplary and should not be understood to limit the scope of the systems and methods disclosed herein. Other types of target EVs are contemplated to be capable of being isolated and captured by the systems and methods disclosed herein. For example, in some implementations, target EVs can include various types of tumor-derived EVs, such as pancreatic tumors. In other implementations, target EVs can include EVs produced cells other than tumor cells that are useful for clinical investigation, such as predicting patients that would receive the greatest benefit from immunotherapy. Alternatively, Isolated EVs from immune cells (or tumor cells) may also help in the pre-conditioning or even design of CAR-T-Cells.",
                        "FIG. 1A is a schematic representation of an example of patient sample processing using a microfluidic system that includes microfluidic devices depicted in FIGS. 1B-D. In this example, a fluid sample (e.g., serum or plasma) is collected from a patient and processed in series using two microfluidic devices. The fluid sample is initially flowed through a depletion module 101, which can be a first microfluidic device, for depletion of non-target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by platelets and/or other healthy cells). A portion of the fluid sample that exits the microfluidic device 101 is then introduced into a capture module 103, which can be a second microfluidic device configured to capture target EVs from the fluid sample. The target EVs that have been captured on the microfluidic device 103 can then be investigated using different types of downstream analysis techniques discussed in greater detail below. For example, the captured target EVs can be investigated using size fractioning RNA analysis, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), and RNA sequencing.",
                        "The depletion and capture modules, e.g., microfluidic devices, 101 and 103 can include channels with herringbone grooves that are used to induce chaotic mixing of the fluid introduced into the channels. The herringbone grooves are discussed in greater detail with respect to FIGS. 1B-D. The microfluidic device 101 is a blank microchip that has surfaces that are not coated with antibodies. The microfluidic device 103 includes one or more surfaces that are coated with antibodies using surface chemistry that is discussed in more detail with respect to Examples 4 and 5 below. The microfluidic device 103 allows specific capture of target EVs based on, for example, interactions between antibodies immobilized on a surface of a microchannel and antigens present on surfaces of the target EVs.",
                        "FIG. 1B is a schematic representation of a microfluidic system 100 that can be used to isolate target EVs. The system includes a microfluidic device 110, a depletion module 120, a capture module 110, a flow control device 130, and an analyzer device 140.",
                        "In general, the system 100 can be used to isolate and capture target EVs from a fluid sample using the capture module 110, such as a microfluidic device. The target EVs captured on the microfluidic device 110 can then be characterized, investigated, or otherwise processed downstream by the analyzer device 140. For example, RNA can be extracted from captured target EVs and evaluated by the analyzer device 140 for the presence of specific genes that are associated with a pathological condition. In some implementations, target EVs captured on the microfluidic device 110 can be extracted to another medium prior to analysis by the analyzer device 140. For example, the captured target EVs can be extracted from the channels of the microfluidic device 110 and further processing and investigation.",
                        "The microfluidic device 110 can be a cartridge that permits the flowing and processing of a liquid sample and an antibody reagent through a fluidic circuit to perform EV capture and isolation as described herein. The fluidic circuit of the microfluidic device 110 can include one or more inlets 110A through which sample fluids are introduced into the microfluidic cartridge, one or more microfluidic channels (or chambers) 112 through which the sample fluids flow, and one or more outlets 110B through which the sample fluids exit the microfluidic channels or chambers.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1B, the channels 112 have columns of herringbone patterns 112A, e.g., as described in US Patent Application No. US2015/0377753, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Each column of herringbone patterns is positioned next to an adjacent column of patterns such that, an apex of a \u201cV\u201d shaped groove in the column is aligned with an apex of the \u201cV\u201d shaped groove in the adjacent column. The apexes of both grooves can lie on a line perpendicular to a principal axis passing through a channel of the microfluidic device 110. If all grooves in a column are equidistantly formed in the channel of the microfluidic device 110, then all grooves in the device will be aligned with each other. In some implementations, a column of herringbone patterns can be offset from an adjacent column. For example, the apex of a \u201cV\u201d-shaped groove in the column can be offset by 10 \u03bcm from the apex of a \u201cV\u201d-shaped groove in the adjacent column. The offset column design can further promote mixing. In some implementations, the multiple columns in the microfluidic device 110 can include symmetric grooves and asymmetric grooves randomly interspersed in each column. The forming of interspersed grooves promotes transverse movement of the fluid and the particles suspended in them, thereby increasing the number of cell-channel wall interactions and consequently increasing cell capture.",
                        "The depletion module 120 can be a device that is used to remove non-specific EVs, e.g., EVs produced by platelets and EVs produced by healthy cells, from a sample fluid. As discussed above with respect to FIG. 1A, a liquid sample is initially introduced into the depletion module 120 prior to prior to introduction into the microfluidic device 110 to improve the specificity of binding target EVs in the microfluidic device 110. In some implementations, the depletion module 120 is a blank microchip that has the same structures and features as the microfluidic device 110, but does not have functionalized channel surfaces that are coated with binding moieties that specifically bind to target EVs. In such implementations, the depletion module 120 can include channels with herringbone pattern grooves 112A to increase the surface area and induce chaotic mixing in the same manner as discussed above with respect to the microfluidic device 110. The depletion module works, because non-specific EVs, e.g., from platelets, naturally bind to surfaces of substrates, and thus are removed from the sample fluid as it flows through the depletion module, even without the use of any binding moieties. On the other hand, target EVs, such as from cancer cells, naturally resist binding to surfaces, and thus do not adhere to surfaces of solid substrates.",
                        "In some implementations, the depletion module 120 can include binding moieties that bind to non-specific EVs. For example, such binding moieties can bind to tetraspanins, e.g., CD63 or CD8, that are associated with membranes of many types of intracellular vesicles, to remove non-target EVs from a fluid sample.",
                        "In some implementations, the depletion device 120 can be a device that provides a high surface area, such as a sponge, a mesh, a forest of fibers, or packed colloids, for removal of non-target EVs from a liquid sample prior to introduction into a microfluidic device that is coated with binding moieties specific to the target EVs. The depletion device 120, in such implementations, can enable a flow rate that induces microvorticies to enable depletion in the same manner as discussed above.",
                        "The flow control device 130 can be any type of fluid delivery device used to introduce a sample fluid into a fluidic circuit. For instance, the flow control device 130 can be a peristaltic pump, a syringe pump, a pressure controller with a flow meter, or a pressure controller with a matrix valve. The flow control device 130 can be attached to tubing that attaches to the inlet port of the microfluidic device 110 to introduce the sample fluid into the channels of the microfluidic device 110. In some instances, the flow control device 130 is also capable of adjusting the flow rate of the sample fluids introduced into the microfluidic chamber according to a predetermined or user-adjusted program. This predetermined program is based on a specific sequence that involves flowing the liquid sample for a certain period of time at certain speeds. For example, the predetermined program can involve flow rates between around 0.5 mL/h to 20 mL/h, e.g., 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, or 20.0 ml/hr. In some instances, the upper limit can be extended by increasing the surface area of channels in the microfluidic device.",
                        "The analyzer device 140 can be a computer-controlled device that is capable of acquiring, processing, and/or storing data associated with target EVs captured on the microfluidic device 110. For example, in some implementations, the analyzer device 140 is an RNA sequencing device, e.g., 10\u00d7, IlluminaMiSeq, BioRAD ddPCR, which is capable of sequencing cytoplasmic or nuclear RNA from captured target EVs. In such implementations, the analyzer device 140 can be used for size-fractioning RNA. In other implementations, the analyzer device 140 can be a microscopic device (e.g., a confocal microscope, fluorescent microscope) that is used to investigate target EVs that have been captured in the channels of the microfluidic device 110. In some other implementations, the analyzer device 140 can be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system that is capable of nucleic acid application and detection.",
                        "A. Microfluidic Device",
                        "FIG. 1C is a schematic representation of the microfluidic device 110 depicted in FIG. 1B. FIG. 1D is a close-up schematic representation of herringbone pattern grooves and/or ridges in a portion of a channel of the microfluidic device 110. As shown in FIG. 1D, the herringbone pattern grooves and/or ridges can be used to a capture target EVs from a fluid sample that flows through a channel of the microfluidic device 110. The fluid sample can include both target EVs (e.g., tumor-derived EVs) and non-target EVs (e.g., EVs produced by platelets). The surfaces of the channel can be coated with antibodies that allow for the selective capture of target EVs but not non-target EVs. Thus, as a fluid sample flows through the channel, target EVs interact with binding moieties, e.g., antibodies or aptamers, immobilized on surfaces of the herringbone groove patterns as non-target EVs flow through the channel with the flow of the liquid sample.",
                        "The herringbone groove patterns can be arranged in a column such that the grooves in the path of the fluid disrupt fluid flow. In some implementations, depending upon flow velocity and the dimensions of the grooves, specifically, for example, a size of the grooves and an angle between the two arms of a groove, the disruption in the fluid flow leads to a generation of microvortices in the fluid. For example, the microvortices are generated because the grooves induce fluid flow in a direction that is transverse to a principal direction of fluid flow, i.e., the axial direction. The microvortices can be induced in flow rates ranging from about 0.5 mL/h to 100 mL/h, e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 mL/h.",
                        "In some implementations, although microvortices are not generated, the grooves induce sufficient disruption to alter the flow path of portions of the fluid to increase wall-particle interactions.",
                        "The heights of herringbone pattern grooves can be varied in different implementations. In general, the choice of groove heights can depend on factors including channel dimensions, particle properties including size, density, and the like, and particle suspension flow rates. Although deeper grooves offer more disruption, other factors can impose limits on groove heights. For example, up to a certain limit, the groove height can be increased in proportion with the channel height. The channel height, and consequently the groove height, can depend upon the particle to channel surface contact area. An increase in channel dimensions can cause a decrease in particle-channel interactions as surface contact area available for the particles to interact decreases relative to the cross-sectional flow area. A lower limit on the channel height, and consequently the groove height, can be imposed to prevent clogging.",
                        "In some implementations, a ratio between groove height and channel height can be less than one, for example, in a range between 0.1 to 0.6. In some implementations, the ratio can be equal to one (e.g., the groove height can be equal to the channel height), or can be greater than one (e.g., the groove height, for example, 60 \u03bcm, can be greater than the channel height, for example, 50 \u03bcm).",
                        "The shape of the grooves, from a top view, can also be different from a \u201cV\u201d shape, for example, \u201cU\u201d shape, \u201cL\u201d shape, and the like. In some particular implementations, the groove and channel heights can between approximately 25 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm, e.g., 25, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 \u03bcm. In some implementations, the grooves are not perfectly square-shaped from a top view, i.e., with apexes formed by a ninety-degree angle, and instead have different angles, e.g. 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 95, 100, 105, 110 or other degrees. In other embodiments, the apexes can be rounded rather than having a sharp angle.",
                        "A channel formed in a microfluidic device can be treated to capture target EVs suspended in a fluid flowing through the channel. A particle capture efficiency of the microfluidic device can be defined as a ratio of a number of particles captured in the channel and a total number of particles flowed through the channel. As described above, grooves (or ridges) are formed extending into (or out of) the walls of the channel to create flow patterns in the fluid that promote an interaction between the particles suspended in the fluid and inner surfaces of the walls of the channel. The increased interaction can lead to an increase in a number of particles captured in the channel, and consequently, in the particle capture efficiency of the microfluidic device. The efficiency can further be increased by tailoring structural features of the microfluidic device including, for example, device substrate material, channel and groove dimensions, and the like, as well as fluid flow parameters such as flow rates based on types of particles and the types of fluids in which the particles are suspended. An example of such a microfluidic device manufactured using soft lithography techniques is described with respect to FIGS. 1B and 1C. As described below, particles are captured in the channel of the microfluidic device 110 by forming grooves in a wall of the channel, coating binding moieties on the inner surfaces of the walls of the channel, and flowing a sample fluid that may contain EVs suspended in the fluid through the channel.",
                        "In some implementations, the channel can have a rectangular cross-section including two side walls, and an upper wall formed in the upper substrate. Terms of relative location such as, for example, \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d are used for ease of description and denote location in the figures rather than necessary relative positions of the features. For example, the microfluidic device 110 can be oriented such that the grooves are on a bottom surface of the channel or such that a central axis of the channel extends vertically. Alternatively, the cross-section of the channel can be one of several shapes including but not limited to triangle, trapezoid, half-moon, and the like. The lower substrate can form the lower wall of the channel once bonded to the upper substrate. In some implementations, the channel includes multiple grooves formed in the upper wall of the channel. Alternatively, the grooves can be formed in any of the walls, and/or can be formed in more than one wall of the channel. The grooves can span an entire length of a wall, or only a portion of the wall.",
                        "B. Surface Chemistry",
                        "Surfaces of the channel formed in the microfluidic device 110 can be functionalized to enable selective capture and isolation of target EVs from a fluid sample (e.g., serum or plasma). Various surface chemistries can be applied to the surfaces to enable, for example, the type of target entity to be captured in the channel of the microfluidic device.",
                        "FIG. 2A is a schematic representation of different surface chemistries for immobilizing binding moieties, e.g., antibodies, aptamers or ligands from a ligand binding pair, heparin, lectins, glycoproteins, onto a surface of a channel of the microfluidic device 110. The surface chemistry is applied to a surface of a substrate 210 that forms a wall of a channel of the microfluidic device 110. Generally, different surface chemistries can be applied to specify the target EVs to be captured using the microfluidic device 110, for example, by varying the antibodies that are immobilized on the surface of the substrate 210. In other examples, such as those shown in FIG. 2A, different antibody immobilization strategies can be used based on differences in biophysics of capture for different types of target EVs. For example, 100 nm diameter EVs within the microfluidic device 110 exhibit different biophysics compared to 10-20 \u03bcm whole cells.",

In this example, the spacer 202 is bound to a platelet-derived fibroblast growth factor receptor (PDFGFR) antibody at a first end and is bound to the surface of the substrate 210 at a second end. Surface chemistry 200B in FIG. 2A represents an immobilization strategy in which layers of gelatin 204 are functionalized onto the surface of the substrate 210. In this example, the top layer of the layers of gelatin 204 is optionally bound to nanostructures, e.g., nanoparticles, 206 that immobilize zero-length linker molecules bound to binding moieties 208, such as antibodies to PDFGFR, endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), and podoplanin (PODO).",

Surface chemistries 200A and 200B were previously applied for immunoaffinity capture of \u03bcm-size particles (e.g., circulating single or clusters of tumor cells), and work to capture EVs, but surface chemistry 200C was even more effective to capture EVs.",

In some implementations, the nanostructures 206 are bound to a member of a binding pair and to one or more binding moieties (e.g., antibodies) that selectively bind to the target EVs. The nanostructures can be bound to the substrate directly or to the top layer of gelatin by a second member of the binding pair. The nanostructures add surface area, e.g., surface roughness, to the substrate or the top gelatin layer and can create two additional benefits: (i) higher local concentration of the binding moieties per unit area, and (ii) multiple orientations of the binding moieties around the surface of the nanostructures that can provide high EV capture efficiency.",

An experiment was conducted to investigate the number of EVs that were captured using the different surface chemistries. Application of the surface chemistry 200C resulted in an approximately two-fold increase in EV capture on the microfluidic device 110 compared to surface chemistry II (200B). Moreover, as described in Example 3 below and depicted in FIG. 6, the effect of molecular weight of the linker molecules 208 on EV capture was also investigated to identify the most effective molecular weight of the linker molecules 208 (e.g., approximately between 1.8-4.8 kDa).

For example, the upper substrate can be fabricated using an elastomer such as, for example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and the lower substrate can be fabricated using glass, PDMS, or another elastomer. Alternatively, or in addition, the substrates can be manufactured using plastics such as, for example, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate, cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), and the like. In general, the materials selected to fabricate the upper and lower substrates can be easy to manufacture, for example, easy to etch, and can offer optical properties that facilitate ease of testing. For example, the upper and lower substrates can be optically clear, and can be non-toxic so as to not negatively affect the cells or molecules attached to the substrate. In addition, the materials are preferred to exhibit no or limited auto-fluorescence. Further, the materials can be easy to functionalize so that analytes can be attached to the substrate. Furthermore, the materials can be mechanically strong to provide strength to the microfluidic device 110. The upper substrate can be securely fastened to the lower substrate, with a micro-channel formed between them, as described throughout.",

The microchip is fabricated using standard photolithography techniques to produce, for example, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and glass device. Various stiffness can be used for the PDMS with a similar effect gained. 3D printing techniques may also be used to produce the microfluidic device 110. The microfluidic device fabrication is scaled up by plastic micro-injection molding of cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) at thinXXS\u00ae Microtechnologies (Germany). In some implementations, other plastics, such as PMMA, may also be used to produce the microfluidic device 110. In such implementations, the microfluidic device 110 is manufactured in two separate molds\u2014one for three-dimensional features, and another for a top layer that is subsequently put together by thermoplastic bonding.

The substrate can then be exposed to a gelatin solution comprising gelatin functionalized with a plurality of the first members of a binding pair, e.g., biotinylated gelatin, at a concentration and for a period of time sufficient for the gelatin to bind to the substrate, e.g., 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes, thereby forming a first layer of gelatin on the substrate by physical adsorption. The time of exposure is one factor in selecting the thickness of the coating, with the maximum thickness being attained at about 15 minutes. Longer times will not add much to the thickness and shorter times will result in a thinner coating. The exposure can be accomplished by flowing the gelatin solution over or onto the substrate and is done at room temperature.

                                "Target EVs that have been captured in channels of the microfluidic device 110 can be isolated for downstream processing and evaluation using various techniques, as discussed below.",
                                "Target EVs can be selectively captured from a liquid sample by contacting the liquid sample to the bioresponsive nanostructures disclosed herein to enable the one or more binding moieties to bind to target particles in the sample. The target EVs can then be released from a substrate, e.g., a slide or a channel within a microfluidic device, via either of two release mechanisms. First, by increasing temperature, e.g., over 30\u00b0 C., e.g., 37\u00b0 C., capture particles can be released in a bulk fashion. Second, by increasing a localized shear stress in the gelatin, e.g., by applying a frequency-controlled force with a vibrating device, e.g., using microtip devices, single cells can be selectively released from the substrate. The versatility of the capture and isolation techniques allows a practitioner to perform various assays with low or high complexity, as discussed below. For low complexity assays such as cell enumeration, culturing and staining, bulk release is sufficient. For high complexity assays such as single cell genomics, the selective release may be preferred.",
                                "Selective release occurs when a localized shear stress is generated in the gelatin layer, e.g., by applying a frequency-controlled force with a vibrating device, e.g., a microtip device, to the gelatin layers. The microtip device can produce a controlled vibration at the surface of the gelatin such that the gelatin is locally removed by shear stress. The size of the gelatin removed depends on the frequency of vibration and a release radius is defined. One way to achieve selective release of captured particles is by using a microtip device. Such a device for selectively releasing one or more captured particles in a gel, includes (1) a microtip; and (2) a vibrator mechanism that is connected to the microtip and moves the microtip at a controlled frequency, where the microtip when contacting the gel produces a localized shear stress in the gel at the controlled frequency, and releases one or more captured particles from the gel. The vibrator mechanism can consist of copper coil and cone mounted on a support, and magnets. The copper coil and cone are connected with an electricity source through connector.",

For example, micrographs of the microfluidic device 110 can be captured with an LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Peabody, Mass.) equipped with a 63x Zeiss Plan-APOCHROMAT\u00ae oil objective. Images are collected at the top plane of the device, i.e., top plane of the herringbone grooves. A total number of 100 images, e.g., 10 by 10 images in x- or y-axis, are acquired. In some instances, similar imaging parameters are used between samples to allow subsequent analyses. Images are processed using Zeiss microscope ZEN software. Semi-quantification of the captured EVs includes determining constant threshold of fluorescent intensity between the signal from EVs and noise and automatically calculated using imaging software.",

RNA is subsequently extracted from lysates using the miRNeasykit (Qiagen, Valencia, Mass.). RNA is eluted from the columns in 50 \u03bcl water and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. RNA quality can be assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer\u00ae (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) with an RNA 6000 Pico Chip kit (Agilent Technologies). Similar amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using the VILO\u00ae super kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The relative levels of GFP, TdT, PPBP, EGFR, EGFRvIII, and GAPDH are assayed by single tube TaqMan\u00ae assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.): GFP, Mr00660654_cn; TdTomato, AI39R57; PPBP, Hs00234077_m1; GAPDH, Hs02758991_g1 [EGFRvIII].",

Five \u03bcl of cDNA is used as input in duplicate reactions for each assay, e.g., EGFRvIII and EGFRwt. About 20,000 droplets are generated using an AutoDroplet\u00ae generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.).",

The last stage is 98\u00b0 C. for 10 min followed by 4\u00b0 C. Droplets are analyzed using a Droplet Reader\u00ae (Bio-Rad). Gates are set to exclude all events from the cDNA no control template sample. All events above the no template control gates are considered positive. Concentrations are calculated in auto mode using software. The patient samples are run without knowing a priori which results from tissue or CSF biopsy are positive for EGFRvIII.",

Amplified cDNA is synthesized from the entire cell lysate using a SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing\u2014v3 kit (Clontech Laboratories). PCR amplification following second strand synthesis is run for 18 cycles. One ng of amplified cDNA is loaded into the Nextera\u00ae XT kit.

Once samples are confirmed to have sufficient quality, samples are aligned to a reference genome using a RNA-seq aligner, such as the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) aligner. Duplicate reads are marked using command line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, such as PICARD, and removed using a suitable program, such as Samtools. Resulting stored sequence data, e.g., BAM files in .bam format, are used to quantify the read counts per gene using a suitable Htseq-count program.",

To obtains insights into the sequencing data, 100, 500,1000 and 2000 most variant genes are selected for hierarchical clustering of all samples based on the expression of these genes. Differential expression analysis between the two clusters can be performed using a package, e.g., DESEQ2 package in R, to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes between any two conditions of interest. Heat maps can be plotted using, for example, a heatmap.2 function in gplots package in R.",

In some implementations, blood is collected from healthy donors and patients having GBM. For example, a total of thirteen samples were collected from GBM patients and six healthy donors. Ten mL blood samples are collected by venipuncture into, for example, a BD Vacutainer SST tube (#367985) or a BD Vacutainer PPT\u00ae (#362788) for serum and plasma respectively. Samples are left to clot for 30 min at room temperature and processed within 2 hours of collection. Serum or plasma is then filtered through a 0.8 \u03bcm filter and run through the microfluidic device 110, as discussed above, or stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. for later processing."

Experiments were conducted using microfluidic devices that were functionalized with surface chemistries with different antibodies to evaluate capture efficiency of each antibody in capturing tumor-derived EVs. For these experiments, cell lines and fluorescent EVs were spiked into a human control serum and used to identify the most promising tumor-specific antibody candidates.

For the cocktail of antibodies, the amount of Cetuximab bound on-chip was reduced by a factor of two (10 \u03bcg/ml) to allow for efficient placement of each antibody in the mixture.

The housekeeping gene (GAPDH) was used to determine the degree of non-specific background RNA message present in the samples (inlet, outlet, and EVHB-Chip), with a similar comparison demonstrating markedly higher GAPDH RNA positive events in the ultracentrifuged samples (input: 1857; output: 1696; microfluidic device: 236, n=2).

Notably, commonly mutated genes for GBM were found over-represented and were grouped as signaling genes (e.g. KRAS, NUCB1, PIK3CA, PRKAR1B). Moreover, gap junction protein and angiogenesis genes showed an over-represented in the cohort of patients (gap and tight junctions: GJC1, CLDN5; angiogenesis: CXCL5, GUCY1A3, GUCY1B3).

For classical subtype: PDGFA, EGFR, and AKT2, for neural subtype: FBXO3, GABRB2, MBP; for proneural subtype: SOX2, ERBB3; for mesenchymal subtype: TLR4, RELB, PTPRC, and CASP1/4/8. These results demonstrate that the microfluidic devices captured tumor EVs containing GBM enriched mRNA signatures and potentially reveal transcriptional heterogeneity in GBM tumors."
