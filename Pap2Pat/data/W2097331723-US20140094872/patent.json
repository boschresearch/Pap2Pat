The stimulus can be delivered to a nerve via a set of multiple electrode contacts according to a stimulation parameter that maximizes a joint moment associated with the stimulus and minimizes the overlap between pairs of contacts. The joint moment can be related to the muscle force, and the overlap can be related to the onset of muscle fatigue.",

For example, a FES standing system stimulates motor units associated with standing to allow a SCI patient to stand for a period of time. For the patient's safety while standing, the FES standing system must ensure that the knees remain locked by delivering a maximal level of constant stimulation. However, the maximal level of stimulation can also cause muscle fatigue that can limit the standing time provided by the FES standing systems."

                        "The present invention generally relates to functional electrical stimulation (\u201cFES\u201d). The term \u201cFES,\u201d as used herein, generally refers to a technique that can restore a motor function to a paralyzed patient. As used herein, the term \u201cpatient\u201d can refer to any warm-blooded organism including, but not limited to, a human being, a pig, a rat, a mouse, a dog, a cat, a goat, a sheep, a horse, a monkey, an ape, a rabbit, a cow, etc. More specifically, FES can restore the function to the paralyzed patient via an application of an electrical stimulus (e.g., one or more time-varying current waveforms) to multiple motor units that can coordinate a muscle contraction. The term \u201cmotor unit,\u201d as used herein, generally refers to a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber innervated by the motor neuron, and a \u201cmuscle\u201d generally includes a plurality of muscle fibers that are part of a corresponding plurality of motor units. As used herein, the term \u201cjoint moment\u201d generally refers to a moment of force produced across a joint associated with the muscle based on a force associated with the muscle contraction. The joint moment is associated with the muscle contraction and associated muscle force.",
                        "Many FES systems apply a constant electrical stimulus (e.g., current stimulus) to motor units to ensure that a strong muscle contraction is maintained. However, the utility of these FES systems can be limited because the constant electrical stimulus can induce rapid muscle fatigue. By employing a time-varying electrical stimulus (with a plurality of corresponding stimulus waveforms) through an electrode that includes a set of multiple electrode contacts (e.g., provided by a multi-contact electrode and/or by a plurality of single contact electrodes) and producing a stimulation parameter of the electrical stimulus (e.g., a phase shift value, a pulse width value, a pulse amplitude value, a pulse frequency value, a total charge value, and/or a different adjustable parameter varying in a sinusoidal manner that facilitates selective stimulation of the nerve), the FES system of the present invention can stimulate a plurality of mutually agonist motor units to maintain a strong muscle contraction with constant muscle force (and corresponding constant joint moment) while delaying the onset of the muscle fatigue (e.g., by reducing the duty cycle of stimulation and/or minimizing the overlap between individual electrode contacts).",

It is understood that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, can represent aspects of the present invention that can be embodied in hardware and/or in software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.). Software aspects of the present invention can be implemented by computer program instructions that can be stored in a non-transitory memory (e.g., any non-transitory medium that can contain or store the program instructions, including, but not limited to, a portable computer diskette; a random access memory; a read-only memory; an erasable programmable read-only memory (or Flash memory); and a portable compact disc read-only memory) and may executed by a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, and/or other programmable data processing apparatus. Upon execution, the functions/acts specified in the block diagrams and/or flowchart block or blocks can be implemented.",

                        "In accordance with the present invention, FIG. 1 depicts an example of a FES system 1 that can configure an electrical stimulus of a nerve such that one or more components of the nerve can signal corresponding muscle fibers to provide a constant muscle force while delaying the onset of muscle fatigue. Examples of suitable applications of the FES system 1 include, but are not limited to, motor neural prostheses for: standing, walking, hand grasp, upper extremity function, and/or bowl, bladder, and erection control. The FES system 1 can include an electrode 6, a stimulator 8, and a stimulation generator 10. The electrode 6, the stimulator 8, and/or the stimulation generator 10 can be configured to communicate via one or more wired and/or wireless connections and can be configured to be implantable within the patient and/or external to the patient.",

Examples of the component include, but are not limited to: a peripheral nerve, a fascicle, a synapse, a motor unit, etc. Although an electrode that is configured to be internal to the patient's body (e.g., an electrode that is in contact with a nerve and/or a muscle) is described herein, it will be understood that the electrode 6 can be located external to the patient's body (e.g., an electrode that contacts the skin).",
                        "The electrode 6 can be configured to deliver an electrical stimulus to the component via a set of multiple electrode contacts (also referred to as the \u201cset of contacts\u201d). The set of contacts can include N electrode contacts, where N is a positive integer greater than or equal to two. In an embodiment, N can be a positive integer greater than or equal to three. Each contact can be configured to provide the electrical stimulus (or a portion of the electrical stimulus) to the component to activate a corresponding portion of the plurality of motor units. It will be understood that due to the placement and/or shape of electrode 6 and/or the anatomical shape of the component, one or more of the individual electrode contacts may not be associated with any portion of the plurality of motor units.",
                        "The set of contacts can be provided by a multi-contact electrode and/or by a plurality of single contact electrodes. Accordingly, the set of contacts can include, but is not limited to, a multi-contact nerve cuff electrode (examples schematically illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3), one or more epimysial electrodes, one or more intramuscular electrodes, one or more electrode arrays, and/or one or more intrafasicular electrodes. However, any type of electrode that can achieve a stable, selective, chronic interface with the associated component of the peripheral nervous system to enable control of a muscle and/or a functionality of the muscle is within the scope of the present invention.",
                        "One example type of nerve cuff electrode, as illustrated in FIG. 2, is a self-sizing spiral nerve cuff electrode 30 (the \u201ccuff electrode\u201d) that is configured to wrap around a portion a nerve, as shown in FIG. 2. The cuff electrode 30 has a circular cross-section and four electrode contacts 6a-6d that are spaced equally around the circumference of the nerve. Because the cuff electrode 30 is circular, it is well suited for interfacing with small circular nerves. However, the cuff electrode 30 may not be as appropriate for larger and/or non-circular (e.g., flatter) nerves at least because the electrode contacts 6a-6d preferentially stimulate a portion of the fascicles 34a-g within the nerve, but can leave other fascicles 36a-d (within the center of the cross section) unstimulated and/or stimulated to a lesser extent.",
                        "Another example type of nerve cuff electrode, as illustrated in FIG. 3, is a flat interface nerve electrode (the \u201cFINE\u201d) 40. In the example depicted in FIG. 3, the FINE 40 has a rectangular cross-section, which aligns the fascicles 42a-42i so that they are close enough to the eight stimulating contacts 42a-42h so that all of the fascicles can be stimulated. Accordingly, the FINE 30 may be better suited for larger and flatter nerves than the cuff electrode 30.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 1, the stimulator 8 can be configured to configure the electrical stimulus according to a stimulation parameter 28 and to provide the configured electrical stimulus to the electrode 6 (e.g., via a stimulator assembly) for stimulation of the plurality of motor units. The stimulation generator 10 can be configured to adjust the stimulation parameter 28 to vary the number of motor units recruited at a time according to the electrical stimulus by each contact. The stimulation generator 10 can be located within the stimulator 8 and/or can be located independent from the stimulator 8. The stimulator 8 and/or the stimulation generator 19 can be configured to provide a control system and/or a power system for FES system 1. Although the stimulator 8 and the stimulation generator 10 are described as external to the patient's body herein, it will be understood that one or both of the stimulator 8 and/or the stimulation generator 10 can be implantable within the patient's body.",

In an embodiment, the electrical stimulus can include a plurality of time-varying current waveforms (the \u201cplurality of waveforms\u201d). As used for exemplary purposes herein, the plurality of waveforms can include sinusoidal waveforms. However, it will be understood that the plurality of waveforms are not limited to sinusoidal waveforms and can include other types of time varying current waveforms associated with one or more parameters that can be adjusted to produce a constant muscle force while delaying the onset of muscle fatigue (e.g., carousel waveforms, interleaved waveforms, etc.).",
                        "The stimulation parameter 28 can be associated with the one or more parameters related to the plurality of waveforms that can be delivered by the contacts to achieve selective stimulation of the plurality of motor units. In an example where the waveforms are sinusoidal waveforms, the stimulation parameter 28 can include, but is not limited to: a phase shift value, a pulse width value, a pulse amplitude value, a pulse frequency value, a total charge value, etc.",
                        "One example of an electrical stimulation that can be generated and configured by the stimulator 8 according to the stimulation parameter 28 is a sum of phase shifted sinusoids (the \u201cSOPS\u201d) electrical stimulation. The stimulation parameter 28 of the SOPS electrical stimulation waveforms can be a pulse width parameter. The waveforms with different pulse widths can cause the joint moments generated by multiple independent motor unit populations to oscillate with equal amplitude and frequency, but offset phases, so that their combined output is a constant value equal to the sum of their average joint moments. For electrodes that can stimulate two or more independent populations of motor units, the total joint moment produced with the SOPS electrical stimulation will, by definition, be greater than the contribution of any single independent population of motor units. This allows a reduction in duty cycle as compared to constant stimulation and a corresponding reduction in fatigue, while still providing a high total joint moment. The SOPS electrical stimulation exhibits an improved circulation and oxygenation of the muscle tissue, a reduction of acidosis, a delay in depletion of glycogen and ATP stores within the muscle, and subsequent delay in the onset of muscle fatigue.",
                        "The SOPS electrical stimulation employs the mathematical identity that the sum of multiple sinusoids with equal amplitude and frequency with phase shift values evenly spread between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 (0 and 2pi radians) will be constant and cancel the oscillations (or \u201cripple\u201d) in the resultant joint moment. As shown in FIG. 4, the moments generated by stimulating each of the three independent populations of motor units (e.g., 52, 54 and 56) oscillate between on and off and, because of their evenly distributed phase shifts values, the oscillations cancel out, resulting in a ripple-free constant joint moment 58 equal to the sum of the offsets of the oscillations.",
                        "Below is the mathematical derivation of an example of this relationship for three independent motor units or populations of motor units, but a similar approach could be taken for any number of independent populations of motor units greater than or equal to two.",

The SOPS electrical stimulation can achieve ripple-free joint moment if the maximum joint moments generated by stimulating through all contacts are equal.",
                        "For example, if there are three independent agonist populations of motor units corresponding to three electrode contacts, and the joint moment produced by stimulating each population is made to oscillate at 0.2 Hz between 0 and 5 Nm, as long as the three sinusoids have phase shifts of 0\u00b0, 120\u00b0 or 240\u00b0, the summed output will be ripple-free, with only the sum of their offsets remaining. This example would produce a constant 7.5 nm of knee extension moment, since the offset for each of the three sinusoids is 2.5 Nm.",

An example configuration of the stimulation generator 10 is illustrated in FIG. 5. The stimulation generator 10 can include a memory 14 (e.g., a non-transitory computer readable medium) to store computer program instructions that correspond to the adjustment of the stimulation parameter 28 and a processor 16 to execute the computer program instructions to adjust the stimulation parameter 28.",

Accordingly, the stimulation generator 10 can determine a first model of the joint moment (\u201cjoint moment model\u201d 20) based on the moment data 16 and a second model of the overlap (\u201coverlap model\u201d 22) based on the overlap data 18.",

The moment data 16 can also include a sum of the individual moments generated based on the stimulus pulses applied to each of the contacts individually. The overlap can correspond to pairs of contacts recruiting the same motor units, thereby increasing the likelihood of fatigue in the motor units that are jointly recruited.",

The cost function can also be a function of the joint moment model 20 and the overlap model 22 (which can be scaled by weighting factors).
