                        "Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have saved millions of lives worldwide. The causes of antibiotic resistance development have been known for a while, but the intent to solve the problem seems to be inadequate. Increasing demands for new antibacterial drugs have not been met due to growing numbers of multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. As development of new antimicrobial drugs is decreasing, we must turn to drugs which are already here.",
                        "This is where helper compounds come to use. Helper compounds are non-antibiotic compounds functioning as adjuvants for antibiotics to operate in synergy. Drugs found to contain helper compound properties were normally used for treatment of non-infectious diseases but might contain some degree of antibacterial activity itself. Since overuse of antibiotics is the main cause of antibiotic resistance, combining antibiotics with helper compounds would require less amount of antibiotic needed to achieve the same growth inhibition than seen when using higher concentration of the antibiotic alone and therefore decrease the likelihood of resistance development. Therefore, new helper compounds need to be found.",
                        "Cannabinoids may be categorized as either endogenous cannabinoids, which are cannabinoids produced by the human body, or exogenous cannabinoids which are produced either by plants such as Cannabis sativa or synthetically. Cannabinoids act on the endocannabinoid system of the human body consisting of two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). These are named cannabinoid type 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) receptors, and depending on the specific cannabinoid, the binding results in either an agonistic or antagonistic effect. Besides endocannabinoids being ligands for the endocannabinoid receptors, exogenous cannabinoids are also able to bind. One of the best characterized exogenous ligands is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It is a partial agonist for both CB1 and CB2 receptor mediating effects such as analgesia, muscle relaxation, and antiemetic effects, but also results in negative effects such as anxiety, psychosis, and sedation. Another exogenous cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which has been observed to decrease the adverse neaative effects of THC. CBD is an antagonist of both CB1 and CB2 receptor leading to the anti-sedative, antipsychotic, and anxiolytic effects. Furthermore, it has been observed to inhibit growth of bacteria (Appendino G et al. Antibacterial cannabinoids from Cannabis sativa: A structure-activity study. Journal of Natural Products. 2008;71(8):1427-30). However, the use of cannabidiol as an antibiotic adjuvant has not been studied so far.",
                        "Hence, improved or new helper compounds would be advantageous, and in particular more efficient and/or reliable new helper compounds would be advantageous."

                        "in here it is disclosed that cannabidiol (CBD) is a potential helper compound in the treatment of bacterial infections. CBD has been found to potentiate the effect of bacitracin and daptomycin against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus species, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis but not Gram-negative bacteria. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that CBD is capable of disrupt the membrane potential in Staphylococcus aureus and possibly inhibit the ATP synthase leading to potentiation of bacitracin. In addition, it is believed that by combining CBD and bacitracin, CBD is able to downregulate or decrease expression of bacitracin resistance genes leading to increased bacitracin concentration and effect. Together, these mechanisms result in a synergy between CBD and bacitracin enabling growth inhibition of resistant Gram-positive bacteria.",
                        "Based on these observations, the combination of CBD with bacitracin and/or daptomycin might be a putative novel treatment in future clinical settings for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections, and in particular, antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections.",

                        "Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of at least 113 active cannabinoids identified in cannabis. CBD does not appear to have any intoxicating effects such as those caused by THC in marijuana, but may have effects on anxiety and anti-psychotic effect.",
                        "Cannabidiol may have the CAS Registry Number 13956-29-1. Cannabidiol may also be in the form of a salt. Thus, the invention is also considered to cover pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Cannabidiol.",

Bacitracin may also be in the form of a salt such as bacitracin zinc salt. Thus, the invention is also considered to cover pharmaceutically acceptable salts of bacitracin.",
                        "Daptomycin",
                        "Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening infections caused by Gram-positive organisms. It is a naturally occurring compound found in the soil saprotroph Streptomyces roseosporus. Its distinct mechanism of action makes it useful in treating infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria. It is marketed in the United States under the trade name Cubicin by Cubist Pharmaceuticals.",
                        "Daptomycin may have the CAS Registry Number 103060-53-3. Daptomycin may also be in the form of a salt. Thus, the invention is also considered to cover pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Daptomycin.",

Thus, in a first aspect the invention relates to a composition comprising\n\n\n- - Cannabidiol (CBD) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and\n  - bacitracin or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and/or\n    daptomycin or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.",

Such effect could not be found when Cannabidiol were combined with other tested antibiotics. Similarly, other members of the cannabinoid family did not show a synergistic effect when combined with either bacitracin or daptomycin (Example 4).",

                        "In an embodiment, the functional equivalents to bacitracin is selected from the group consisting of Viridicatumtoxin, Spirohexaline, and Plantaricin C. Viridicatumtoxin and Spirohexaline, are small fungal molecules with a tetracyclic scaffold and an additional spirobicyclic ring in common. They were were found to inhibit bacterial undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) synthase with IC50 values of 4 and 9 \u03bcM, respectively. They showed antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Furthermore, molecular modeling strongly suggested that the hydrophobic spirobicyclic ring of viridicatumtoxin interacts with three hydrophobic clefts of the active site in MRSA UPP synthase (The Journal of Antibiotics volume 69, pages 798-805 (2016)). Plantaricin C (PlnC) falls into the category of lipid II-interacting antimicrobial peptides and acts as a potent cell wall synthesis inhibitor. PlnC shares intermediate features with the prototype lantibiotics raisin and mersacidin concerning both its structure and lipid II interaction, which are also reflected in its biological activity (Appl Environ Microbiol. 2006 April; 72(4): 2809-2814).",
