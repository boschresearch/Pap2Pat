## EXAMPLES

### Combining Cannabidiol with Antibiotics

- introduce study aim
- describe materials and methods
- detail bacterial growth conditions
- explain minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index
- describe micro dilution growth experiments
- outline chequerboard setup for screens
- present results of screens
- calculate FIC index
- define synergy
- visualize growth curves
- discuss results
- conclude synergy between CBD and antibiotics

### Example 2

- study bacterial spectrum of CBD and bacitracin on Gram-positive bacteria
- conclude synergy on different Gram-positive bacteria

### Example 3

- study bacterial spectrum of CBD and bacitracin on Gram-negative bacteria

### Example 4

- investigate synergy for other members of the cannabinoid family
- conclude no synergy for other cannabinoids

### Example 5

- study triple combination of CBD, daptomycin, and bacitracin on Gram-positive bacteria
- conclude synergistic potential for triple combination

### Example 6

- study CBD with kanamycin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and with polymyxin B on Salmonella typhimurium and Es
