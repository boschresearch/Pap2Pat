    "abstract": "The cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) is characterised in this study as a helper compound against resistant bacteria. CBD potentiates the effect of bacitracin (BAC) against Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus species, Listeria monocytogenes , and Enterococcus faecalis ) but appears ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. CBD reduced the MIC value of BAC by at least 64-fold and the combination yielded an FIC index of 0.5 or below in most Gram-positive bacteria tested. Morphological changes in S. aureus as a result of the combination of CBD and BAC included several septa formations during cell division along with membrane irregularities. Analysis of the muropeptide composition of treated S. aureus indicated no changes in the cell wall composition. However, CBD and BAC treated bacteria did show a decreased rate of autolysis. The bacteria further showed a decreased membrane potential upon treatment with CBD; yet, they did not show any further decrease upon combination treatment. Noticeably, expression of a major cell division regulator gene, ezrA , was reduced two-fold upon combination treatment emphasising the impact of the combination on cell division. Based on these observations, the combination of CBD and BAC is suggested to be a putative novel treatment in clinical settings for treatment of infections with antibiotic resistant Gram-positive bacteria.",

                "Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have saved millions of lives from fatal infections world-wide. However, with time bacteria have developed mechanisms to escape the effects of antibiotics. The amount of antibiotics used seems to be directly related to development of antibiotic resistance. Similarly, a growing number of multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria is a result of inadequate intentions to solve the resistance problem and increasing unmet demands for new antibacterial drugs1.",
                "With fewer antibiotics available to treat MDR bacterial infections, the possibility of entering a pre-antibiotic era is looming ahead. Alternative strategies are being explored and helper compounds, also known as antibiotic potentiators or resistant breakers, are attracting attention2. Helper compounds are non-antibiotic compounds functioning as adjuvants for antibiotics to operate in synergy through various mechanisms including efflux pump inhibition, inhibition of enzymes, and changes in membrane permeability, all of which may contribute to increasing the efficacy of a specific antibiotic 3,4. Drugs found to contain helper compound properties are normally used for treatment of non-infectious diseases but may contain some degree of antibacterial activity itself5. Helper compounds are usually associated with side-of-action in the central and peripheral nervous system as local anaesthetics and in psychopharmaceutic practice, where they usually block membrane associated transporter activity5.",
                "Overuse of antibiotics is the main cause of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, by combining an antibiotic with a helper compound less antibiotic is needed in order to achieve bacterial growth inhibition or killing compared to using the antibiotic alone. This strategy may therefore decrease the likelihood of resistance development, and investigations to identify efficient helper compounds are thus important.",
                "Cannabinoids are categorised as either endogenous cannabinoids, which are cannabinoids produced by the human body, or exogenous cannabinoids, which are produced either by plants such as Cannabis sativa or synthetically. Cannabinoids act on the endocannabinoid system of the human body6 consisting of two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). These are named cannabinoid type 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) receptors, and, depending on the specific cannabinoid, the binding results in either an agonistic or antagonistic downstream effect7. Besides endocannabinoids being ligands for the endocannabinoid receptors, exogenous cannabinoids are also ligands for the receptors. One of the best characterised exogenous ligands is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It is a partial agonist for both CB1 and CB2 receptor mediating effects such as analgesia, muscle relaxation, and antiemetic effects, but also results in negative effects such as anxiety, psychosis, and sedation. Another exogenous cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which has been observed to decrease the adverse negative effects of THC. CBD is an antagonist of both CB1 and CB2 receptor leading to anti-sedative, anti-psychotic, and anxiolytic effects7. However, these are not the only known effects of CBD, as it is able to cause a variety of different effects such as inhibition of cancer cell growth8, neuroprotection in both neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease9 and post-ischemia10, and anti-inflammatory effects as in type-1 diabetes11. Not much is known regarding antimicrobial effects of cannabinoids and even less on the mechanism of action. Endocannabinoids and exogenous cannabinoids such as CBD have been observed to inhibit growth of bacteria12\u201314, yet the use of cannabidiol as an antibiotic adjuvant has not been studied so far.",
                "In the present study, we aim to characterise cannabidiol as a potential helper compound against resistant bacteria in combination with the cyclic peptide antibiotic bacitracin (BAC). BAC is a mixture of related cyclic peptides operating as a bactericidal antibiotic by interfering with the\u00a0cell wall and interrupting the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan leading to cell lysis15."

                        "Initially, we validated the antimicrobial effect of cannabidiol (CBD) against the Gram-positive bacterium Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as previously published by Appendino and colleagues14 but also for Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). We found the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) to be 4\u2009\u00b5g/mL for S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and the MRSE strain and 8\u2009\u00b5g/mL for E. faecalis, indicating that Gram-positive bacteria are sensitive towards CBD (Table\u00a01).Table 1*FIC index indicates synergy when FIC index \u2264 0.5, indifference when 0.5 < FIC index < 4, and antagonism when FIC index > 437.StrainMIC CBD (\u00b5g/mL)MIC BAC (\u00b5g/mL)Fold reduction in MIC of BAC when combined with \u00bdxMIC CBDFIC Index*MRSA USA300 FPR375746432\u2013640.5E. faecalis (13\u2013327129)864\u2265640.375L. monocytogenes (EGD)451280.625MRSE (933010 3F-16 b4)432640.5",
                        "To determine whether CBD would induce a higher susceptibility of BAC in Gram-positive bacteria, MICs of BAC were determined for the four Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of CBD. Remarkably, the MIC of BAC was decreased by 8 to at least 64-fold when combined with 1/2 x MIC of CBD compared to MIC of BAC alone in the different Gram-positive strains (Table\u00a01). Furthermore, the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index was determined for each Gram-positive bacteria. The results showed a FIC index at 0.5 for both MRSA USA300 and MRSE and 0.375 for E. faecalis indicating weak synergistic effect between the compounds CBD and BAC (Table\u00a01). After combining CBD with other antibiotics, both similar and different types, we concluded that CBD had the best effect together with BAC (see Supplementary Figure\u00a0S1).",
                        "To assess the potentiating effect of CBD on BAC over time, measurements of bacterial growth over 24\u2009hours\u2009in the presence of either CBD alone or in combination with BAC were performed. The assessment concentrations of CBD were at 2\u2009\u00b5g/mL and 8, 16, and 32\u2009\u00b5g/mL for BAC. As seen in Fig.\u00a01a, growth of S. aureus is inhibited by 2\u2009\u00b5g/mL CBD and 16\u2009\u00b5g/mL BAC combined compared to monotherapies of the individual compounds. The results suggest that CBD can potentiate the antimicrobial effects of BAC. Similarly, growth measurements of E. faecalis, MRSE, and L. monocytogenes on monotherapies and combination (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d), suggests that the combination of CBD and BAC is useful against other Gram-positive bacteria.Figure 1Growth curves of cannabidiol (CBD) in combination with bacitracin (BAC).

                        "To clarify whether CBD and BAC act in synergy, time-kill assays were performed (Fig.\u00a01e). CBD and BAC reduced the viability by 6 log10 CFU/mL compared to CBD alone. The result shows that a clear synergistic effect in fact exists between CBD and BAC, and that the effect is bactericidal. The slight re-initiation of growth after 8\u2009hours is almost certainly caused by degradation or oxidation of the cannabinoid16. To verify that the decreased CFU upon combination treatment is caused by killing of the bacteria and not due to clustering of the cells, microscopy was performed at the time 1, 2, 4, and 8\u2009hours post treatment (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S2). Images show no additional clustering of the cells treated with the combination compared to the other treatments.",
                        "To further assess the spectrum of use for the combination of CBD and BAC, growth of Gram-negative bacteria upon treatment was measured as well. The Gram-negative bacteria tested were strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S3). Experiments for CBD and BAC against the Gram-negative bacteria revealed MIC values above 128\u2009\u00b5g/mL for all tested bacteria, presumably due to the outer membrane. In addition, the experiments did not reveal any synergy between CBD and BAC in the concentrations tested, limiting the use of the combination to Gram-positive bacteria."

                        "We have established that CBD can potentiate the effect of BAC in Gram-positive bacteria. The next step is to study the mechanism underlying this synergy. First, we looked at the morphological changes of S. aureus USA300 upon exposure to CBD and/or BAC by treating a culture at start exponential phase for 2.5\u2009hours and then performing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the cells. Results showed that CBD and BAC alone caused no morphological changes, as they resembled untreated control and EtOH control. However, as seen in Fig.\u00a02a, treatment with the combination of CBD and BAC resulted in large undivided cells with several septa formations or several initiations of septum formation indicating severe defects in cell division (red arrows) and irregularities around cell envelope (green arrow) (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S4). The result was confirmed by staining the Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) in the membrane using Bocillin-FL, a fluorescence-conjugated penicillin V derivative (Fig.\u00a02b) which showed similar morphology (red arrows). As peptidoglycan synthesis occurs both at the septal and peripheral cell wall, we can observe irregularities concerning the peptidoglycan all over the cell surface17. Upon exposure to either CBD or BAC alone regular septum formations were visualised, however, when treated with the combination, several septa formations appeared for some of the cells as visualised by Bocillin-FL as in the TEM images. This suggests that the combination of CBD and BAC affects the cell envelope causing irregular cell division visualised by multiple septa formations and irregular cell membrane. To study whether the cell division defect is specific for the combination of CBD and BAC, microscopy analysed using higher concentrations of CBD and BAC at 4 and 64\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively, was performed (Supplementary Information Figure\u00a0S5). Images show cells with multiple septa upon treatment with 64\u2009\u00b5g/mL BAC, indicating that the effect visualised is not specific to the combination of CBD and BAC. However, it further emphasises the CBD mediated potentiation of BAC, since this phenotype did not appear at lower BAC concentration. Adding a higher concentration of CBD did not seem to\u00a0cause any division defects.Figure 2Morphology of USA300 FPR3757 following treatment with CBD and/or BAC.

Therefore, a Triton X-100 induced autolysis assay was performed. S. aureus USA300 were grown until start exponential phase and stressed for one hour with CBD, BAC, CBD+BAC, EtOH or left untreated. Cells were then washed and incubated with or without triton X-100. As suspected, upon treatment with the combination of 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL CBD and 16\u2009\u00b5g/mL BAC a significant decreased autolysis was observed (Fig.\u00a03) compared to the untreated control from 90 to 300\u2009minutes except at the 150\u2009minute timepoint, indicating cell division arrest.Figure 3Effects of CBD and BAC on autolysis.

The chromatogram of purified digested muropeptides revealed the typical pattern of S. aureus18 with the highest peak found in the dimeric fraction (peak 4). Treating the bacteria with both CBD and BAC alone or in combination did not change the pattern of the HPLC chromatogram of the muropeptides (Fig.\u00a04) indicating no change in the muropeptide composition. Even though the relative amount of some of the muropeptide fractions were significantly different, the degree of cross-linking was unaltered when compared to the untreated control (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S3, S4 and S5).

To evaluate effects on the bacterial membrane, the membrane potential was measured when exposed to either CBD, BAC, or the combination of the two (Fig.\u00a05). Accumulation of the fluorescent dye DiOC2(3) in healthy bacteria cells with intact membrane potential results in red fluorescence (high red/green ratio), whereas lower concentrations of the dye, due to membrane potential disruption, exhibit green fluorescence (low red/green ratio), as visualised for the depolarised control using CCCP. Thus, the ratio between red and green fluorescence can reveal the state of the membrane potential. As shown in Fig.\u00a05, even very low concentrations of CBD at 0.1 and 0.2\u2009\u00b5g/mL as well as concentration of BAC at 16\u2009\u00b5g/mL resulted in a significant lower red/green fluorescence ratio compared to either the untreated or the EtOH control indicating disruption of the membrane potential. However, combining BAC with CBD at either 0.1 or 0.2\u2009\u00b5g/mL did not show any significant further membrane depolarisation compared to either CBD or BAC alone.Figure 5Measurements of membrane potential in USA300 treated with CBD, BAC and the combination using BacLight Bacterial Membrane Potential Kit as described in Methods. The ratio between the mean red fluorescence and mean green fluorescence was calculated as a measure of membrane potential for each sample since the dye will accumulate in unaffected cells thus emitting a red fluorescence, whereas in cells with affected membranes less accumulations will occur resulting in emission of green fluorescence.

Similar to the TEM experiment, S. aureus USA300 was grown for 2.5\u2009hours after exposure to CBD and/or BAC in the exponential growth phase. Analysis of transcriptional changes of selected genes (see Supplementary Table\u00a0S1) involved in the divisome, cell division and autolysis of S. aureus upon treatment was performed by Reverse Transcriptase qPCR. Regarding the divisome and cell division genes, ezrA was shown to be the most regulated gene upon combination treatment at approximately 2-fold down-regulation (Fig.\u00a06a). EzrA is an important multifunctional component of the bacterial cell divisome implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis and assembly of the cell division apparatus19. The results for the remaining genes analysed can be seen in Supplementary Figure\u00a0S8. These data support the TEM images by showing that CBD in combination with BAC disrupts the cell division. As autolysis was shown to be decreased upon treatment with the combination of CBD and BAC, we studied the expression of selected autolysis genes. Of the genes studied, the expression of lytM and lytN showed to be highly upregulated upon combination treatment at approximately 2.5 (Fig.\u00a06b) and 3.5 (Fig.\u00a06c), respectively, whereas the combination treatment did not seem to affect the expression of the other genes autolysis genes (atl, sle1, lytA)) compared to treatment with either CBD or BAC alone (see Supplementary Information Figure\u00a0S8).Figure 6qPCR data of the divisome gene ezrA and autolysis genes lytM and lytN studied upon 2.5\u2009hours treatment with either CBD, BAC, combination, EtOH or left untreated in USA300.

                "The limited availability of effective therapies against S. aureus has increased the pursuit to discover new treatment strategies. Development of new antibiotics is currently undergoing an innovation gap, while research in the use of helper compound in combination with antibiotics is becoming more intense. It has previously been reviewed that many natural compounds such as flavonoids and compounds from manuka honey and teas have been reported to potentiate antibiotics20\u201322. In this study, we found that the antibacterial effects of BAC against S. aureus as well as other Gram-positive bacteria can be enhanced by cannabidiol originating from the Cannabis plant. The potentiation was confirmed through MIC determinations, standard growth experiments, fractional inhibitory concentration determination and time-kill assays. As expected, the combination turned out to be ineffective in Gram-negative bacteria, as BAC is a mixture of related cyclic peptides which interrupt cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria and is probably unable to cross the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. BAC interferes with the dephosphorylation of bactoprenol (C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate); a membrane lipid-carrier that transports peptidoglycan-precursors across the membrane for peptidoglycan biosynthesis23,24. The use of BAC in combination with other compounds against S. aureus has been studied before such as in combination with colistin25 and alkyl gallates26,27. Colistin is believed to damage the cell membrane thus increasing entry of BAC into the cell or by increasing availability of divalent ions such as Zn2+. This is important for the functionality of BAC25, whereas the mechanism underlying the alkyl gallate mediated potentiation of bacitracin is unknown. However, it has been shown to bind the bacterial membrane affecting the membrane integrity suggesting similar mechanism for synergy as suggested for colistin28.",
                "The use of CBD and other cannabinoids as antibacterial agents was first described in 1976 by Van Klingeren and Ten Ham13 and again in 2008 by Appendino and colleagues14, however, since then very little has been published on this topic. CBD is a quite effective antimicrobial compound with a MIC value of 4\u2009\u00b5g/mL against S. aureus USA300 and other Gram-positive bacteria. Appendino and colleagues14 found MIC values of CBD extracted from powdered plant material in the 0.5-1\u2009\u00b5g/mL range towards various drug-resistant strains of S. aureus. However, the mechanism or how CBD and other cannabinoids affects the bacteria has not been studied so far. Endogenous endocannabinoids as anandamide (AEA) and endocannabinoid-like arachidonoyl serine (AraS) has been shown to contain poor antimicrobial properties but have a pronounced dose-dependent inhibitory effects on biofilm formation of all tested MRSA strains12. In this study, we have shown that the cannabinoid CBD is able to potentiate the antibacterial properties of the cell wall targeting BAC. Nevertheless, unlike in the case of the endocannabinoids, we did not find any effect on biofilm formation and breakdown in our experimental setup (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S9). This may indicate a different mechanism of action for CBD.",
                "Cell imaging is an approach to obtain indications of the mechanism or site of action of an antimicrobial compound. Cells grown in the presence of either CBD or BAC did not reveal any phenotypical changes compared to the untreated or the EtOH control. However, treatment with the combination of CBD and BAC revealed a remarkable phenotype visualised by transmission electron microscopy. The TEM images showed bacteria with several septa causing lack of cell separation during cell cycle and a distorted cell membrane. The lack of cell separation and termination of the cell cycle is consistent with the Triton X-100 induced autolysis assay showing a decrease in autolysis upon combination treatment. We therefore thought to study the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the autolysis and found the expression of lytM and lytN to be upregulated upon combination treatment. In a study of gene silencing of the major regulator of cell wall metabolism walRK, S. aureus was shown to have similar phenotype as observed in this study; several septa and initiation of septa29. In addition, they found that by increasing the expression of lytM, they could restore the viability of the cells even though the cells had still formed several septa. Based on this, the increased expression of lytM, and perhaps also lytN, might be due to a kind of self-defense mechanism trying to restore the cell viability. Regarding the several septa formation, similar characteristics have been recorded by others as well, e.g. by treating S. aureus with the wall teichoic acid biosynthesis inhibitor targocil 30,31, causing both decreased autolysis and impaired cell division as visualised by several septa formations. In addition, formation of several septa has been visualised by others by creation of gene knockouts or by performing gene silencing of genes important for cell cycle regulation. Pang and colleagues showed this phenotype in a \u0394noc strain, lacking a very important cell division regulator32. In addition, Stamsas and colleagues found effects on septum formation in a \u0394cozEa strain upon gene silencing of cozEb, encoding proteins which together are important for proper cell division in S. aureus and which interacts with the major cell division protein EzrA33. Furthermore, construction of a conditional ezrA mutant has also shown to cause impaired cell division and several septa formations in S. aureus34. The fact that ezrA is downregulated upon exposure to the combination of CBD and BAC by approximately two-fold, indicates that the combination of CBD and BAC affects the cell division in S. aureus. Steele and colleagues19 showed that S. aureus cells partially depleted of EzrA cannot divide without sufficient levels of EzrA. The authors also showed that EzrA is required for peptidoglycan synthesis. Nevertheless, the combination of CBD and BAC in our experimental setup does not seem to have a noteworthy effect on peptidoglycan synthesis, or at least not on the composition of the peptidoglycan nor the degree of cross-linking, as the muropeptide analysis showed a similar pattern in the chromatograms of the untreated cells as for the CBD and BAC treated cells. However, whether the decreased expression of ezrA is a direct or a secondary effect of the combination treatment is unknown and will be studied further in the future.",
                "The exact mechanism of CBD potentiation of BAC is not yet fully understood; however, it was visualised that the combination did cause cell division complications and envelope irregularities. As mentioned above regarding the combination of colistin and BAC and presumably alkyl gallates, one would argue that CBD could have similar mechanism, that is affecting the membrane as visualised by the membrane potential disruption. This causes either increase of BAC entry into the cell or increased divalent ion availability for BAC. On the other hand, the mechanism of potentiation seems to be specific for bacitracin, since no particular synergy was observed when combining CBD with either dicloxacillin, daptomycin, nisin or tetracycline indicating other mechanisms for CBD mediated potentiation of BAC than an increased uptake due to disrupted membrane."

                "Through growth experiments, it was interestingly found that CBD was able to potentiate the effects of BAC against S. aureus USA300 and other Gram-positive bacteria. However, it was found to be ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. Upon treatment with the combination of CBD and BAC, it was revealed by TEM that the morphology of the cells had changed compared to cells treated with either CBD or BAC alone or left untreated. The cells showed several septa formations indicating lack of cell separation during cell division causing reduced autolysis, as well as an irregular membrane. In addition to this, a very important cell division gene, ezrA, turned out to be transcriptionally\u00a0down regulated upon combination treatment. Changes observed in morphology was not caused by compositional changes in the cell wall muropeptide composition. Membrane potential changes for the combination of CBD and BAC compared to either CBD or BAC treatment alone did not reveal the mechanism of action for the combination of CBD and BAC. Future studies are therefore focused on the cell division and cell envelope to identify the mechanism of action."
