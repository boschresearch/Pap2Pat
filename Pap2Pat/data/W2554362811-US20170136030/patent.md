# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally relates to compounds that inhibit the methylerythritol cytidyltransferase (IspD) enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway (MEP pathway), which is present in many organisms including the P. falciparum parasite. Inhibitors of the IspD enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of the P. falciparum parasite are useful for treating malaria. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to methods of treating malaria by administering a composition comprising an IspD enzyme inhibitor compound.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Malaria remains a major threat to global health, with over 250 million cases per year and one million deaths per year, primarily in children under the age of five. The primary parasites that cause malaria, P. falciparum and P. vivax, are largely resistant to older therapies. Quinine and derivatives such as chloroquine have been used for decades for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, and are often the drugs of last resort for the treatment of severe malaria. However, the usefulness of these drugs has rapidly declined in parts of the world where resistant strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax have emerged and are now widespread. P. falciparum is also increasingly resistant to relatively newer frontline agents that have been developed (e.g., semi-synthetic artemesinins). Therefore, an urgent need remains for the discovery of new antimalarial agents.

Isoprenoids represent a diverse family of over 35,000 natural products, including sterols and terpenes. The biosynthesis of isoprenoids occurs through the repeated condensation of a key precursor, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Mammals and fungi derive IPP from a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent pathway, which proceeds through the key intermediate mevalonate. Recent studies have identified the MEP pathway (also known as the non-mevalonate and the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway) as an alternative biosynthetic route to IPP. The MEP pathway is utilized by plants, algae, bacteria and protozoa, but is crucially absent in mammalian systems, which instead utilize the mevalonate pathway to synthesize IPP. MEP pathway enzymes are known to be present in all intraerythrocytic stages of the P. falciparum parasite.

Accordingly, the MEP pathway in parasites including P. falciparum is an attractive target for next generation antimalarial therapies. Thus, there remains a need for compounds that are capable of disrupting this critical pathway to treat malaria.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

Generally, the present invention is directed to compounds that inhibit the IspD enzyme in the MEP pathway and methods of treating diseases caused by parasitic organisms that possess the MEP pathway. The MEP pathway is present in many organisms including the P. falciparum parasite. Accordingly, inhibitors of the IspD enzyme in the MEP pathway of the P. falciparum parasite are useful for treating malaria.

A schematic of isoprenoid biosynthesis via the MEP pathway is shown in FIG. 1. The MEP pathway is catalyzed by nine enzymes over a total of eight steps. The enzymes in this pathway are named according to E. coli nomenclature, although there is a proposed standardized nomenclature system in the literature (1). The pathway begins with the condensation of pyruvate 1 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) 2, catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Dxs), with thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) acting as a cofactor. Pyruvate is thought to form a covalent intermediate with TPP, allowing reaction with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The second enzyme in the pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (IspC), catalyzes both an intramolecular isomerization and reduction to generate 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate 4 (MEP). Fosmidomycin, a potent inhibitor of the MEP pathway, inhibits this enzyme from multiple organisms (2). In the next stage, MEP is coupled to cytidine triphosphate to produce 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME) 5 by 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol cytidyltransferase (IspD). CDP-ME then undergoes phosphorylation by an ATP dependent kinase, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase (IspE). 2C-Methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF) then catalyzes the cyclization of 4-diphospho-cytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate 6 into 4-diphospho-cytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate 7 (cMEPP). A two electron reduction of cMEPP forms 2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl diphosphate 8, followed by conversion to IPP 9 and DMAPP 10. These steps are catalyzed by 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate synthase (IspG) and 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (IspH), respectively.

Isoprenoid biosynthesis via the MEP pathway has been shown to be essential to development in many organisms (3-7). Compounds that inhibit the IspD protein halt further development, which kills the organism. Thus, inhibitors of IspD are capable of killing parasites such as malaria that possess the MEP pathway. MEP pathway enzymes are present in all intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. A plastid organelle known as the apicoplast, present within Plasmodium spp parasites, has recently been shown to serve a single function, namely the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors during blood stage growth, additionally validating the MEP pathway as a viable drug target (9). As drug resistance to frontline treatments for malaria emerges for conventional frontline treatments, the compounds of the present invention advantageously provide inhibition of a new therapeutic target, the IspD enzyme.

### EXAMPLES

The following non-limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention.

**Example 1**

Inhibition of Malaria IspD Enzyme

Compounds listed in Table 1 were tested for activity against purified recombinant Plasmodium falciparum methylerythritol cytidyltransferase (PfIspD) enzyme. Reactions were continuously monitored for phosphate release, as previously described for bacterial IspD in Zhang et al., Biochemistry, (2011) 50(17), 3570-3577, which is incorporated herein by reference. Each compound was evaluated for enzymatic inhibition over several concentrations. Nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism) was used to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for each compound.

Antimalarial Efficacy

Each compound was tested for the ability to inhibit growth of a standard cultured Plasmodium falciparum parasite strain 3D7. Parasite growth was monitored by staining with the DNA fluorophore Sybr Green, as previously described for the antimalarial fosmidomycin in Zhang et al., Biochemistry, (2011) 50(17), 3570-3577. Each compound was evaluated for antimalarial activity over several concentrations. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine the concentration of half-maximal antimalarial efficacy (EC50) for each compound. Comparison of activity against the target enzyme (IC50) and antimalarial efficacy (EC5) for each compound demonstrated that increased potency against the target was highly correlated with increased efficacy against malaria parasites. See FIG. 2. These data show that the antimalarial efficacy of the tested compounds is through cellular inhibition of the target ISPD enzyme.

Mechanism of Action

Metabolic Profiling of Inhibitor-Treated Malaria Parasites

A quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed to determine the cellular levels of metabolites in the MEP pathway. This method allows determination of whether the MEP pathway has been inhibited in malaria parasites treated with MEP pathway inhibitors of the present invention. This method has been previously used to validate the cellular metabolic effects of the known MEP pathway inhibitor fosmidomycin (Zhang et al., Biochemistry 2011). This method was used to determine whether the compounds of the present invention also inhibited the MEP pathway. It was found that downstream metabolites in the MEP pathway (CDP-ME and cMEPP) are significantly decreased when parasite lines are treated with compound 41 (2-(4′-methoxy-[1,1′biphenyl]-3-yl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one), a representative IspD inhibitor of the present invention. FIG. 3 presents these results.
