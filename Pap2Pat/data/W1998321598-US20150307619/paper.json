    "abstract": "Purpose.: We characterized antigen-presenting cell (APC)\u2013relevant chemokine receptor expression in dry eye disease (DED), and investigated the effect of topical CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-7 blockade specifically on Th17 cell immunity and dry eye disease severity. Methods.: We induced DED in female C57BL/6 mice. Chemokine receptor expression by corneal APCs was characterized using immunohistochemistry. To determine the functional role of CCR7 in DED, mice were treated topically with either anti-CCR7, a control isotype antibody, or left untreated, and clinical disease severity, Th17 responses, and molecular markers of DED were quantified. Results.: Frequencies of CD11b+ cells and their chemokine expression were increased in the cornea of DED mice. Mice treated topically with anti-CCR7 antibody displayed a significant reduction in clinical disease severity and Th17 response compared to the isotype and untreated groups. Topical CCR7 blockade was effective in ameliorating DED in its acute and chronic stages. Conclusions.: Our findings suggest that CCR7-mediated trafficking of APCs drives the induction and maintenance of Th17 immunity in DED and that CCR7 blockade is effective in suppressing the immunopathogenic mechanisms in DED.",

Mice were exposed to the CEC for 12 days and additionally injected with scopolamine hydrobromide 0.5 mg/0.2 mL (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., Springfield, MO, USA) subcutaneously into their dorsal skin three times a day, to maximize ocular surface dryness. Age-and sex-matched control mice were housed in the normal environment of the animal facility and did not receive scopolamine hydrobromide. The induction and progression of DED was evaluated clinically using corneal fluorescein staining (CFS). A total of 1 lL of 5% fluorescein was applied to the lateral conjunctival sac of the mice, and eyes were examined for fluorescein staining using slit-lamp biomicroscopy under a cobalt blue light. Punctate staining was scored by two individuals using the National Eye Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA) grading system. One observer was masked and the scores of both observers were averaged at the end of each experiment. Mice were euthanized after 12 days of exposure to the CEC, and tissues were collected for immunohistochemical and molecular studies."

                        "The cornea contains a heterogeneous population of resident APCs. These include Langerhans cells and dendritic cells (DC) in the epithelium, 23,24 as well as langerin \u00fe DCs 24 and CD11c \u00fe CD11b \u00fe DCs in the stroma. 2 5 In addition, CD11b \u00fe CD11c \u00c0 macrophages/monocytes are located in the stroma. 25,26 We selected CD11b as an APC marker to capture most sets of the steady state populations in the cornea, as well as infiltrating APCs. 10,11 Our data showed infiltration of APCs into the cornea of mice with DED, and are consistent with previously reported results. 11 Chemokines have been implicated in the mobilization of T cells and APCs in corneal alloimmunity and models of corneal inflammation. However, to date, comparably less is known about chemokine expression in DED. 15,27,28 Our results demonstrated increased frequencies of CCR1-, CCR2-, CCR5-, and CCR7-expressing APCs within the corneal stroma. These results suggested a key role for chemokine-mediated APC trafficking in DED, and are consistent with several reports describing elevated expression levels of the chemokine ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 at the ocular surface and tear film in DED. 15,29 Mature APCs are known to upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR7, which facilitates their directional migration towards lymphoid tissue, in response to a CCL21 chemotactic gradient generated in part by the lymphatic 30 Notably, the functional importance of CCR7-mediated APC trafficking from the cornea to the DLNs in the afferent phase of the corneal alloimmune response has been highlighted by previous findings indicating a reduction in APC migration to the LNs following subconjunctival CCL21 blockade. 20 The corneal lymphangiogeneic response described in DED is thought to serve as the primary conduits for APC migration to the cervical LNs. 31 Our results showed increased frequencies of CCR7-expressing CD11b \u00fe cells in the corneal stroma, increased frequencies of mature CCR7 \u00fe CD11b \u00fe cells within the DLNs of DED mice, and decreased frequencies of mature APCs (CD11b\u00feMHC II\u00fe) in the DLNs after treatment with an anti-CCR7 antibody, thus suggesting an important role for CCR7 in directing APC trafficking in DED. The frequencies of IL-17-secreting CD4 T cells (Th17) are significantly increased in the LNs of DED mice and they have been demonstrated to be a critical CD4 \u00fe population in DED. 7,8 Notably, they have been reported as displaying a relative resistance to T regulatory suppression. 9 Additionally, their effector functions in DED include, but are not limited to, the stimulation of lymphangiogenesis and direct disruption of the corneal epithelial barrier via upregulating MMP expression. 8 In our DED mouse model, Th1 cells frequencies in the DLNs are not increased after disease induction and anti-CCR7 treatment showed no effect on Th1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Clearly, several inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and MMPs, are increased in the cornea and conjunctiva in DED. 7 However, in this study we focused on Th17associated molecules and inflammation markers. Our findings showing decreased frequencies of Th17 cells in LNs, as well as reduced IL-17 mRNA expression in the conjunctiva, and reduced expression of MMP-3, IL-1b, and TNF-a at the ocular surface of anti-CCR7-treated DED mice, clearly implicated a role for CCR7 in inducing ocular inflammation and suggested a role in Th17 immunity in DED. Because CCR7 is expressed not only by APCs, but also by other immune cells, including T cells, 32 blockade of CCR7 might act on several levels.",
                        "To assess the functional significance of CCR7 in DED, we used the approach of topical CCR7 blockade in vivo in a murine disease model. Furthermore, topical application was selected over systemic administration given our goal of exclusively impairing the afferent arm of APC mobilization to the DLNs, as systemic administration also would impact upon homing of regulatory T cells to the LNs. 17 Other investigators have observed significantly reduced clinical scores following topical treatment with anti-CCR7 antibody in their model of ocular allergy. 2,33 Consistent with this report, we observed that topical anti-CCR7-treated mice did not develop clinically significant DED, which suggests a fundamental role for CCR7 in the induction of DED.",
                        "It is thought that APC migration from the cornea to the DLNs is an essential requirement for the induction of DED, evident by the failure of DED to develop in mice, which have had either depletion of ocular surface APCs or cervical lymphadenectomy. 12 Our data showing significantly reduced clinical scores in anti-CCR7-treated mice certainly are consistent with this hypothesis. However, the question of whether continuous trafficking of APCs along the ocular surfacelymphoid axis is required to sustain the immune response in DED following the initial induction remains unknown. To address this question, we evaluated topical CCR7 blockade in a chronic DED model. Despite re-exposure to the CEC, topical anti-CCR7-treated mice do not have chronic DED, suggesting that re-exposure to a desiccating stimulus in the absence of CCR7-mediated APC migration to the DLNs is insufficient to perpetuate DED.",
                        "In summary, our findings revealed the chemokine receptors associated with APC infiltration into the cornea of DED mice as well as suggested a key role for CCR7 in the trafficking of corneal APCs to the DLNs in DED. Furthermore, our novel data demonstrated that topical CCR7 blockade is highly effective in inhibiting the immunopathogenesis of acute and chronic DED, in terms of clinical and molecular markers of the disease.
