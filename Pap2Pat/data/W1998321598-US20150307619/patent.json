                        "Dry Eye Disease (DED) is recognized as a common cause of ocular surface inflammation, and remains one of the most frequent reasons that patients seek ophthalmic care. The commonly reported symptoms of DED, which include dryness, irritation, foreign body sensation, light sensitivity, and decreased visual acuity, have a debilitating impact upon activities of daily living. DED is estimated to affect approximately 5 million Americans over the age of 50 years, with millions more experiencing intermittent symptoms of dry eye. Despite the high prevalence of this condition, current therapeutic strategies are restricted to symptomatic relief with artificial tears, as well as non-specific corticosteroid therapy and topical cyclosporine. However, the long-term use of corticosteroids is limited by the sight-threatening side effects of raised intraocular pressure and cataracts. Additionally, tolerability issues such as burning and stinging have been reported with cyclosporine. Therefore, there is an unmet need for immunomodulatory agents that target specific components of the underlying immune response in DED."

The invention also provides for methods for the treatment and prevention of ocular surface inflammatory disease in a subject in need of such treatment by administering the formulations of the present invention (e.g., topically or subconjunctivally) directly to the eye or region of the eye of the subject. The subject is preferably a mammal in need of such treatment, e.g., a subject that has been diagnosed with dry eye or a predisposition thereto. The mammal can be any mammal, e.g., a human, a primate, a mouse, a rat, a dog, a cat, a horse, as well as livestock or animals grown for food consumption, e.g., cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and goats. In a preferred embodiment, the mammal is a human.",
                        "Compositions comprising a C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) inhibitor are described herein.

                        "The ocular surface disease comprises dry eye disease or an autoimmune or inflammatory condition including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and microbial keratitis. In some cases, the dry eye disease is chronic dry eye disease. The dry eye disease comprises keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome associated keratoconjunctivitis sicca, non-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome associated keratoconjunctivitis sicca (e.g., as seen in graft-versus-host disease), keratitis sicca, sicca syndrome, xerophthalmia, tear dysfunction disorder, decreased tear production, aqueous tear deficiency (ATD), meibomian gland dysfunction, or hyperevaporate tear deficiency.",

Additionally, the CCR7 inhibitor is administered at a dose effective to reduce or prevent migration of antigen-presenting cells to lymphoid tissue of the subject. Specifically, the CCR7 inhibitor is administered at a dose that impairs migration of antigen-presenting cells to the lymphoid tissue of the subject, thereby interfering with priming of T cells including the induction of Th1 and Th17 immunity in the draining lymph node. This is then reflected in the reduction of priming of T cells and the reduction of an observable Th1 and/or Th17 immune response in ocular or adnexal tissue.",

                        "The CCR7 inhibitors/antagonists are administered to the ocular surface (i.e., topically) at a dose of 1 to 2 drops. Alternatively, the CCR7 inhibitors/antagonists are subconjunctivally administered at a dose of 0.5-1 ml. The concentration of CCR7 inhibitors/antagonists is from about 0.001% to about 10% (w/v). Alternatively, the concentration of CCR7 inhibitors/antagonists is from about 0.01% to about 10% (mg/ml).",
                        "Suitable CCR7 antagonists include a neutralizing anti-CCR7 antibody, a small molecule antagonist of CCR7, a peptide that blocks CCR7, a blocking fusion protein of CCR7, and any agent directed against CCR7 ligands (e.g., an anti-CCL19 antibody or an anti-CCL21 antibody). For example, the antagonist, e.g., CCR7-specific antibody, binds to the receptor (CCR7) on a cell expressing CCR7 in an ocular tissue, thereby impairing CCR7-mediated signaling.",
                        "The neutralizing anti-CCR7 antibody is specific to CCR7, CCL19, or CCL21 in the species of the intended subject. For example, the neutralizing antibody is a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a single chain antibody, a humanized antibody, a recombinant antibody, or a chimeric antibody.",

                        "Suitable forms of the composition include a solid, a paste, an ointment, a gel, a liquid, an aerosol, a mist, a polymer, a film, an emulsion, or a suspension. In some cases, the composition is incorporated into or coated onto a contact lens. For example, the composition is a depot preparation, or a sustained-release formulation. Preferably, the formulation is an aqueous formulation. The term \u201caqueous\u201d typically denotes an aqueous composition wherein the carrier is to an extent of >50%, more preferably >75% and in particular >90% by weight water.",
                        "In some cases, the method further comprises the administration of a second therapeutic agent. For example, therapeutic agents suitable for treatment of an ocular surface disease include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or any other appropriate therapeutic agent including agents that target pathogenic cytokines in ocular surface disease such as those that target interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-17 (IL-17). Agents that target or inhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) can inhibit or decrease IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 expression or activity. For example, agents that target or inhibit IL-1 include, but are not limited to, recombinant and/or soluble IL-1 receptor \u03b1 or IL-1 receptor \u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1R\u03b1, or IL-1R\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antagonists and/or inverse agonists. An example of an IL-1 receptor antagonist is Anakinra/Kineret (Amgen). Examples of agents that target or inhibit IL-17 include, but are not limited to, recombinant and/or soluble IL-17 receptors, IL-17 or IL-17 receptor monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antagonists and/or inverse agonists. Examples of commercially available agents that target IL-17 include, but are not limited to Ixekizumab (Eli Lilly and Co.), thymoquinone (Novus Biologicals, Catalog No. NBP2-26241) and plumbagin (Novus Biologicals, Catalog No. NBP2-26242).",

Agents that target or inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) include, but are not limited to, recombinant and/or soluble TNF-\u03b1, receptors, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antagonists and/or inverse agonists. Examples of commercially available agents that target TNF-\u03b1, include, but are not limited to, etanerept/Embrel (Amgen, Pfizer), infliximab/Remicade (Janssen Biotech, Inc.), and adalimumab/Humira (Abbott Laboratories). Agents that target or inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) include but are not limited to, recombinant and/or dominant negative MMP-3 mutants, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antagonists and/or inverse agonists. Examples of commercially available agents that target MMP-3 include, but are not limited to, MMP-3 Inhibitor I (EMD Millipore, Catalog No. 444218-5MG), MMP-3 Inhibitor IV (Santa Cruz Biotech, Catalog No. sc-311433), N-isobutyl-N(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-glycylhydroxamic Acid (Calbiochem, Catalog No. 444218), N-[[(4,5-Dihydro-5-thioxo-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino]-N-(cyclohexylmethyl-(2)-benzenepropanamide (Calbiochem, Catalog No. 444243).",

For example, the composition comprising the CCR7 inhibitor is administered every 72 hours, every 48 hours, every 24 hours, every 12 hours, every 6 hours, every 3 hours, every 1 hour, or any other appropriate interval. The composition comprising the CCR7 inhibitor is administered for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or 120 days. Alternatively, the composition comprising the CCR7 inhibitor is administered for long-term use, i.e., more than 120 days, more than 150 days, more than 180 days, more than 210 days, more than 240 days, more than 270 days, more than 300 days, more than 330 days or more than 360 days.",
                        "In some cases, administration of the CCR7 inhibitor decreases expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-1\u03b1, and IL-10 that are induced in ocular surface disease. Alternatively, administration of the CCR7 inhibitor decreases expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in dry eye disease.",

In some cases, the subject is asymptomatic, but at high risk for developing an ocular surface inflammatory disease, e.g., post refractive surgery. The ocular surface inflammatory disease is selected from the group consisting of dry eye disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and microbial keratitis.",

Each carrier must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the supplement and not injurious to the patient. Optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is non-pyrogenic. Some examples of materials which may serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.",

The preferred antibody is a monoclonal antibody reactive with the antigen. The term \u201cantibody\u201d is also intended to encompass mixtures of more than one antibody reactive with the antigen (e.g., a cocktail of different types of monoclonal antibodies reactive with the antigen). The term \u201cantibody\u201d is further intended to encompass whole antibodies, biologically functional fragments thereof, single-chain antibodies, and genetically altered antibodies such as chimeric antibodies comprising portions from more than one species, bifunctional antibodies, antibody conjugates, humanized and human antibodies. Biologically functional antibody fragments, which can also be used, are those peptide fragments derived from an antibody that are sufficient for binding to the antigen. \u201cAntibody\u201d as used herein is meant to include the entire antibody as well as any antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab\u2032)2, Fab\u2032, Fab, Fv) capable of binding the epitope, antigen or antigenic fragment of interest.",

Specifically, as used herein, an \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cpurified\u201d nucleic acid molecule, polynucleotide, polypeptide, or protein, is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. Purified compounds are at least 60% by weight (dry weight) the compound of interest. Preferably, the preparation is at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 99%, by weight the compound of interest. For example, a purified compound is one that is at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) of the desired compound by weight. Purity is measured by any appropriate standard method, for example, by column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. A purified or isolated polynucleotide (ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) is free of the genes or sequences that flank it in its naturally-occurring state. A purified or isolated polypeptide is free of the amino acids or sequences that flank it in its naturally-occurring state. Purified also defines a degree of sterility that is safe for administration to a human subject, e.g., lacking infectious or toxic agents.",

Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given polypeptide. For instance, the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG all encode the amino acid arginine. Thus, at every position where an arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent substitutions\u201d or \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of \u201cconservatively modified variations.\u201d Every polynucleotide sequence described herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation, except where otherwise noted. Thus, silent substitutions are an implied feature of every nucleic acid sequence which encodes an amino acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule by standard techniques.",
                        "Similarly, \u201cconservative amino acid substitutions,\u201d in one or a few amino acids in an amino acid sequence are substituted with different amino acids with highly similar properties are also readily identified as being highly similar to a particular amino acid sequence, or to a particular nucleic acid sequence which encodes an amino acid. Such conservatively substituted variations of any particular sequence are a feature of the present invention. Individual substitutions, deletions or additions which alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids (typically less than 5%, more typically less than 1%) in an encoded sequence are \u201cconservatively modified variations\u201d where the alterations result in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. See, e.g., Creighton (1984) Proteins, W.H. Freeman and Company, incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "By \u201cisolated nucleic acid\u201d is meant a nucleic acid that is free of the genes which flank it in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. The term covers, for example: (a) a DNA which is part of a naturally occurring genomic DNA molecule, but is not flanked by both of the nucleic acid sequences that flank that part of the molecule in the genome of the organism in which it naturally occurs; (b) a nucleic acid incorporated into a vector or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote in a manner, such that the resulting molecule is not identical to any naturally occurring vector or genomic DNA; (c) a separate molecule such as a cDNA, a genomic fragment, a fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or a restriction fragment; and (d) a recombinant nucleotide sequence that is part of a hybrid gene, i.e., a gene encoding a fusion protein. Isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention further include molecules produced synthetically, as well as any nucleic acids that have been altered chemically and/or that have modified backbones. For example, the isolated nucleic acid is a purified cDNA or RNA polynucleotide.",

                        "Dry Eye Disease (DED) is recognized as a common cause of ocular surface inflammation, and remains one of the most frequent reasons leading patients to seek ophthalmic care (Kymionis et al., 2007 Am J Ophthalmol, 143:409-15). The commonly reported symptoms of DED, which include dryness, irritation, foreign body sensation, light sensitivity, and decreased visual acuity, can have a debilitating impact upon activities of daily living. The disease is estimated to affect approximately 5 million Americans over the age of 50 years, with millions more experiencing intermittent symptoms of dry eye (Asbell and Spiegel, 2007 Ocul Surf, 5:93-107).",
                        "Dry eye disease is a highly prevalent condition, estimated to affect 10-20% of the adult population (Zhu et al., 2007 Ocul Surf, 5(2): 75-92). Despite the high prevalence of dry eye disease, current therapy for moderate to severe dry eye disease relies on nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, which are fraught with side effects. Specifically, current therapeutic strategies are restricted to symptomatic relief with artificial tears, as well as non-specific corticosteroid therapy and topical cyclosporine (Restasis). However, the long-term usage of corticosteroids is limited by the sight-threatening side effects of raised intraocular pressure and cataracts (Kyrieleis et al., 2000 Curr Opin Ophthalmol, 11:478-483). Additionally, tolerability issues such as burning and stinging have been reported with Restasis\u00ae (cyclosporine; Brown et al., 2009 Arch Ophthalmol, 127:146-152). Therefore, given the nonspecific nature and adverse side effect profile of these current therapies, there remains an unmet need for immunomodulatory agents that focus on targeting specific components of the underlying immune response in DED."

                                "Dry eye disease is characterized by symptoms, ocular surface damage, reduced tear film stability, tear hyperosmolarity, and inflammatory components. Dry eye disease can be diagnosed through a variety of tests (symptom questionnaires, ocular surface staining, tear break-up time, and osmometry) (See, e.g., Bron A J, 2001 Sury Ophthalmol, 45 Suppl 2:S221-6, incorporated herein by reference). According to Khanal et al., tear osmolarity is the best single test for the diagnosis of dry eye, whereas a battery of tests employing a weighted comparison of tear turnover rate (TTR), evaporation, and osmolarity measurements derived from discriminant function analysis is the most effective. (Khanal et al., 2008 Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 49: 1407-1414, incorporated herein by reference). Dry eye disease symptoms also includes symptoms associated with eyelid margin and/or the meibomian glands, including thickening, itchiness, redness or swelling of the eyelids; blocked meibomian glands or abnormal meibomian gland secretions."

A CCR7 antagonist comprises any agent able to prevent CCR7 mediated signal transduction in cells, and may include, without limitation, a blocking fusion molecule or antibody directed against CCL19 and CCL21 ligands, neutralizing anti-CCR7 antibody, soluble peptides able to bind CCR7, a blocking fusion protein or antibody against CCR7, and small molecule antagonist of CCR7.",
                                "Antagonists may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, antibodies, or any other molecules that decrease the effect of a protein. As used herein, antagonists of CCR7 include any compound (agent) which modulates functions of CCR7, such as a protein, peptide, small organic molecule, nucleic acid, peptidomimetic, soluble chemokine receptor, and antibody.",
                                "For example, antagonists of CCR7 include an antibody which binds to CCR7 and inhibits the interaction between CCR7 and a chemokine (or ligand for CCR7), an agent (e.g., a fragment of CCR7) which binds to the chemokine receptor but does not elicit intracellular signaling events, and a compound which reduces or inhibits the CCR7 expression. Similarly, exemplary antagonists of a chemokine receptor includes an antibody which binds to the chemokine receptor and inhibits the interaction between the chemokine ligand and CCR7, an agent (e.g., a fragment of the chemokine receptor) which binds to CCR7 and prevents the interaction between CCR7 and the wild-type chemokine ligand, and a compound which reduces or inhibits the chemokine receptor expression.",
                                "Antibodies are exemplary antagonists. Antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal; intact or truncated, e.g., F(ab\u2032)2, Fab, Fv; xenogeneic, allogeneic, syngeneic, or modified forms thereof, e.g., humanized, chimeric, etc. Preferably, the antibody agonist is a neutralizing antibody (i.e., an antibody whose binding does not lead to the lysis or destruction of the CCR7 expressing cell).",
                                "Antibody generation against CCR7 polypeptide can be obtained by administering the polypeptide or epitope-bearing fragments, analogs or cells to an animal, preferably a nonhuman, using routine protocols. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used. Examples include the hybridoma technique (Kohler, et al., Nature (1975) 256:495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor, et al., Immunology Today (1983) 4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, pp. 77-96, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985). Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can also be adapted to produce single chain antibodies (e.g., against CCR7). Also, transgenic mice or other organisms including other mammals, may be used to express humanized antibodies.",
                                "The neutralizing anti-CCR7 antibody has a binding specificity to CCR7, CCL19, or CCL21 in the species of the subject. For example, the anti-CCR7 antibody has a binding specificity of mouse CCR7 (R&D, Catalog No.: MAB3477)",
                                "Potential antagonists may include a small molecule (such as a peptidomimetic) that binds to CCR7, making it either more readily accessible or inaccessible to the other binding partner such that normal biological activity is enhanced or prevented. Examples of small molecules include, but are not limited to, small peptides or peptide-like molecules (e.g., a peptidomimetic). As used herein, the term \u201cpeptidomimetic\u201d includes chemically modified peptides and peptide-like molecules that contain non-naturally occurring amino acids, peptoids, and the like. The term includes compounds that are partially amino acid (peptidic) in nature and partially organic chemical in nature. For example, at least one peptide bond is replaced by another more durable bond or by an organic molecule having the ability to retain the functionality of amino acids they replace. Peptidomimetics also include molecules bearing identifiable resemblance to a peptide that, as a ligand of a biological receptor, can imitate or inhibit the effect of a natural peptide. A \u201cpseudopeptide\u201d comprises a peptidomimetic where one or more peptide bonds have been replaced with an isostere, a surrogate functionality that is isosteric and/or isoelectronic with a peptide amide bond.",
                                "Peptidomimetics provide various advantages over a peptide, including enhanced stability when administered to a subject. The peptidomimetic has at least 10% of the activity of the reference peptide/polypeptide, e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 99%, or 100% of the activity of the reference peptide/polypeptide. Methods for identifying a peptidomimetic are well known in the art and include the screening of databases that contain libraries of potential peptidomimetics. For example, the Cambridge Structural Database contains a collection of greater than 300,000 compounds that have known crystal structures (Allen et al., Acta Crystallogr. Section B, 35:2331 (1979)). Where no crystal structure of a target molecule is available, a structure can be generated using, for example, the program CONCORD (Rusinko et al., J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 29:251 (1989)). Another database, the Available Chemicals Directory (Molecular Design Limited, Informations Systems; San Leandro Calif.), contains about 100,000 compounds that are commercially available and also can be searched to identify potential peptidomimetics of CCR7.",
                                "In particular, potential antagonists also include soluble forms of a chemokine receptor (e.g., CCR7), such as fragments of the receptor which bind to CCR7 and prevent CCR7 from interacting with membrane bound (wild-type) chemokine receptor. Optionally, the fragments are derived from the intracellular or extracellular domains of CCR7. See, e.g., U.S. Publication No. 2011/0014128, incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
                                "Antagonists also encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 50 and less than about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl or carboxyl group. The CCR7 antagonist may be a thiadiazoledioxides and thiadiazoleoxides. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,691,856, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety by reference in its entirety. The CCR7 antagonist may be a tertiary amine containing a multiplicity of heteroaromatic substituents as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,835,731 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,864,265, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The CCR7 antagonist may be a piperazinylpiperidine derivative as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,678,798, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                                "Candidate antagonists can be obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are available or readily produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds can be modified through conventional chemical, physical, and biochemical means. Known pharmacological agents may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, and amidification, to produce structural analogs."

CCL19 is a small cytokine belonging to the CC chemokine family that is also known as EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3-beta (MIP-3-beta). CCL19 is expressed abundantly in thymus and lymph nodes, with moderate levels in trachea and colon and low levels in stomach, small intestine, lung, kidney and spleen. This chemokine elicits its effects on its target cells by binding to the chemokine receptor chemokine receptor CCR7. CCL19 attracts certain cells of the immune system, including antigen-presenting cells and antigen-engaged B cells, CCR7+ central-memory T-Cells.

                                "The critical contribution of inflammation to the development and progression of DED has become increasingly clear in recent years. Hyperosmolarity resulting from desiccating stress induces the epithelial expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Chemokine-mediated recruitment of immature antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to the ocular surface ensues (as explained above), with the pro-inflammatory milieu promoting their subsequent activation and maturation (Stevenson et al., 2012 Arch Ophthalmol, 130:90-100). In accordance with the acquisition of maturation markers, mature APCs up-regulate the chemokine receptor CCR7, which facilitates their directional migration towards lymphoid tissue, in response to a CCL21 chemotactic gradient generated in part by the lymphatic endothelium (Saeki et al., 1999 J Immunol, 162: 2472-2475). By capture and subsequent presentation of Antigen to T helper (Th) lymphocytes, as well as being involved in driving T cell differentiation (e.g., Th1, Th2, and Th17), APCs play a central role in the induction of adaptive immune responses. Unparalleled expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules (e.g., B7.1 and B7.2) allows mature APCs to be potent T cell stimulators.",
                                "As described above, there was an increase in the frequencies of CCR7 expressing mature APCs in the regional lymph nodes (LN) of DED mice (FIG. 4). In the regional LNs, APCs activate IL-17 producing T-helper cells (Th17), which have been identified as the dominant effectors in DED and capable of corneal epithelial barrier disruption.",
                                "Described in detail below is the prevention of the induction and maintenance of Th17 mediated immunity in DED by interfering with the trafficking of mature APCs from the ocular surface to regional LNs through the topical blockade of CCR7. This approach has been successfully implemented by Schlereth who observed significantly reduced clinical scores following topical treatment with anti-CCR7 antibody in their model of allergic conjunctivitis (Schlereth et al., 2012 Am J Pathol, 180: 2351-60).",
                                "DED was induced by exposing mice to a desiccating environment within a controlled environment chamber (CEC), and supplementing this with subcutaneous injections of scopolamine. Initially, the role of topical CCR7 blockade on the induction of DED and Th17 immunity was examined. Mice were treated topically from the first day of exposure to the CEC with either anti-CCR7 antibody (clone 4B12; R&D Systems, catalog number: MAB3477), isotype control antibody (R&D Systems, catalog number: MAB006) or remained untreated. The anti-CCR7 antibody was administered at a concentration of 1% (mg/ml) using a volume of 2 \u03bcl/dose instilled topically onto the ocular surface. The clinical severity of the disease was evaluated by clinical fluorescein scoring (CFS) using the National Eye Institute (NEI) grading scheme. A significant difference (p<0.0001) in CFS scores were observed between the anti-CCR7 and isotype treated groups over the 8 days of observation (FIG. 5A). FIG. 5B shows the mean percentage reduction in CFS scores (normalized to mean CFS scores in untreated DED group) in isotype and anti-CCR7 treated mice at day 8.",
                                "Next, the effect of topical CCR7 blockade in previously sensitized mice that were re-exposed to the desiccating environment of the CEC for a second time was examined. The purpose of the second experiment (FIG. 6) was to evaluate the potential therapeutic value of this approach in chronic DED by determining the effect of topical CCR7 blockade on DED in mice that had been re-exposed to the CEC following prior induction of DED. Dry eye was initially induced as outlined above for a total of 12 days. Mice from all 3 groups were initially placed into the CEC until day 12, with the subsequent observed rise in CFS scores confirming the primary induction of DED. The DED mice were then removed from the CEC and housed in room air until day 22, during which time CFS scores decreased, but remained higher than baseline. During the induction and room air phases, all mice remained untreated. At day 22, mice were returned to the CEC, and treatment commence in all 3 groups. Because treatment began on day 22, the therapeutic effect of blockade of CCR7 was observed from this time point forward.",
                                "A schematic diagram of the experimental design to study the effect of topical CCR7 blockade on chronic DED is shown in FIG. 6A. A similar difference (p<0.001) in CFS scores was observed in the anti-CCR7 treated group compared to isotype treated (FIG. 6B), suggesting that topical CCR7 blockade is effective in ameliorating DED following prior sensitization. FIG. 6C shows the mean percentage reduction in CFS scores (normalized to mean CFS scores in untreated DED group) in isotype and anti-CCR7 treated mice at day 29. **, p=0.0001.",
                                "In order to examine the effect on Th17 induction, frequencies of CD4+IL-17+ cells in the regional draining lymph nodes of the mice utilized in the experiments above were quantified using flow cytometry. A reduction in Th17 frequencies was demonstrated in the anti-CCR7 treated group (0.9%), compared to isotype treated (1.5%) and untreated (1.6%), suggestive of a minimal Th17 response in the draining lymph node of anti-CCR7 treated mice (FIG. 7A). These findings are in accord with the reduction of IL-17a expression observed in the conjunctiva of anti-CCR7 DED mice compared to isotype treated mice (FIG. 7B).",
                                "Next, conjunctival mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined. Since IL-17 has been implicated in inducing DED associated up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) which are critical to corneal epithelial barrier disruption (Chauhan and Dana, 2009 Mucosal Immunol, 2:243-253), mRNA expression of MMP-3 in corneal tissue was determined. Decreased mRNA transcript levels of MMP-3, (p<0.05), was demonstrated in anti-CCR7 treated corneas (FIG. 8A). Decreased expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were observed in conjunctival and corneal tissue derived from anti-CCR7 treated mice, compared to isotype treated (FIG. 8B and FIG. 8C). Values presented are the mean of three. N=3-6 mice per group.",
                                "In summary, the data presented herein demonstrates that topical CCR7 blockade is highly effective in inhibiting the immunopathogenesis of DED and implicates the contribution of CCR7 mediated trafficking of mature APCs in driving the induction and maintenance of the Th17 response in DED. Thus, topical CCR7 antagonism is an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DED and ocular surface disorders."
