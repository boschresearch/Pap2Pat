### Selection and Purification of Human Anti-F1 and Anti-V Fabs Clones

- select and purify Fab clones

### Binding of the Selected mAbs as Fabs and IgG1s to Their Antigens

- determine specificity and affinity of selected antibodies

### Low Level of Competition Between the Human Anti-F1 and Anti-V Fabs and Mouse Anti-F1 and Anti-V Mabs

- analyze competition between human and mouse mAbs

### Epitope Mapping by Peptide-ELISA

- map epitopes of human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs

### Example 5

- test binding of human anti-F1 IgG1 to Y. pestis
- analyze binding data by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence
- evaluate protection of human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs against Y. pestis challenge

## Discussion

- introduce antibiotics and limitations
- motivate antibody-based therapies
- describe human mAbs against Y. pestis
- discuss mechanism of protection and potential applications
