                        "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus) has exposed weaknesses in the ability of the biomedical community to respond to this and future pandemics. In particular, a major barrier to controlling the spread of the disease has been the availability of cheap, reliable and serologically reactive sources of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for use in diagnostic testing. Typical protein overproduction systems include bacteria, yeast, mammalian cell lines and several plant species. A major drawback of bacteria and yeast expression systems is that they lack the proper glycosylation machinery to produce recombinant proteins having the complex glycosylation patterns similar to those found on human proteins. This represents an especially important drawback for expressing recombinant coronavirus antigenic proteins, which have been shown to be extensively glycosylated (Grant et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2016). Conversely, while recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cell lines typically possess the necessary glycosylation machinery, such expression systems are costly to operate, requiring specialized infrastructure and biocontainment. While there have been several attempts to genetically engineer yeast and other non-mammalian species to be versatile platforms capable of producing a variety of therapeutic recombinant proteins having human-like glycosylation, those efforts have largely proved unsuccessful, with the few successes being limited to individual strains being adapted to produce individual proteins with their activities being individually validated. Thus, improved methods for producing cost-effective recombinant coronavirus proteins that are sufficiently natively glycosylated, immunogenic, and serologically active would be highly desirable."

Recent advancements in genetic tool development, such as efficient DNA delivery methods, replicating plasmids, antibiotic selection markers, and gene-editing systems, have enhanced the potential utility of P. tricornutum as an orthogonal production system. Despite such advancements, there are only a limited number of efficient inducible gene promoters available and there have been relatively few reports of the successful expression in P. tricornutum of exogenous glycoproteins, particularly those that are extensively glycosylated.",
                        "Here, we utilize P. tricornutum as an expression system for the overexpression and purification of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We show that RBD produced in P. tricornutum (PtRBD) is N-linked glycosylated and can competitively inhibit binding of recombinant RBD produced in mammalian cell culture to the human ACE2 extracellular signalling domain. We also show that nucleocapsid protein produced in P. tricornutum (PtNC) is unglycosylated and is predominantly expressed as a N-terminally truncated protein that is nevertheless recognizable by control anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. Also demonstrated herein is the conjugation of PtRBD and PtNC, as well as their implementation in a functional lateral flow assay device and their potential to specifically bind IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins present in serum from human patient samples. Overall, the results disclosed herein demonstrate that  P. tricornutum represents a suitable expression system for low cost production of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus glycoprotein or protein antigens.",

Interestingly, for recombinant proteins secretable by P. tricornutum, it is further shown herein that phosphate- and iron-limiting conditions may induce increased secretion of recombinant proteins under control of the HASP1 promoter. Indeed, the data presented herein suggest a number of strategies for phosphate-regulated expression based on titrating media phosphate that would be particularly applicable, for example, for the expression of toxic proteins and/or for timing expression for particular growth stages.",

                                "All plasmids were constructed using a modified yeast assembly protocol (Gibson et al., 2006; Noskov et al., 2012). We cloned versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene into the E. coli /  P. tricornutum shuttle plasmid pPtGE31 (Slattery et al., 2018). We obtained SARS-CoV-2 expression plasmids from the Krammer lab in New York city. These served as templates for PCR amplification of the human codon-optimized spike and receptor-binding domain coding regions for cloning into P. tricornutum expression plasmids. We also ordered synthetic constructs corresponding to the full-length spike protein gene and RBD from IDT-DNA that were codon-optimized for P. tricornutum. The nine initial constructs are listed in FIG. 1 and a representative schematic can be seen in FIG. 2. The polynucleotide sequences of the plasmids pSS1, pSS2, pSS3, pSS4, pSS5, pSS6, pSS7, and pSS8 are provided in SEQ ID NOs: 2-9 or 15-19. The constructs differed in the following ways: codon-optimization for human or P. tricornutum, full-length or RBD of the spike protein, version 1 or version 2 of the P. tricornutum HASP1 promoter (originating from two homologous P. tricornutum chromosomes). We also cloned a version of the full-length construct with two proline stabilizing mutations and a mutation of the furin cleavage site (RRAR) to an alanine, in addition to a stabilizing trimerization motif. The constructs were made with a promoter from the P. tricornutum 40SRPS8 (40S ribosomal protein S8) gene or from the HASP1 gene (highly abundant secreted protein 1). All constructs contained the 40SRPS8 terminator downstream of the spike or RBD coding sequence. All constructs also included a histidine marker (PRA-PH/CH) expression cassette from the pPtPRAPHCH plasmid (Slattery et al., 2020) for selection and maintenance in a P. tricornutum histidine auxotroph strain. Plasmids encoding the P. tricornutum codon-optimized versions had the HASP1 promoter and the HASP1 secretory signal peptide, while plasmids encoding the human codon-optimized versions used the 40SRPS8 promoter and the native spike protein secretory signal. The plasmid constructs were assembled in yeast by co-transforming linear DNA fragments of the pPtGE31 plasmid backbone, the PRA-PH/CH expression cassette, the HASP1 or 40SRPS8 promoter, and the spike or RBD protein gene. Resultant yeast colonies were pooled, DNA extracted, and transformed into E. coli. Single E. coli colonies were grown and plasmid DNA isolated using standard plasmid mini-prep kits. Correct assembly was confirmed by restriction enzyme digests, by whole-plasmid sequencing using a Minion sequencer from Nanopore, and by sequencing of the spike and RBD protein expression cassettes at the London Regional Genomics Centre.",

The pH-adjusted gold was then diluted in ultrafiltrate H2O to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 (peak absorbance observed between wavelength 350 to 540 nm). Purified algae-RBD (0.213 mg/mL) was conjugated by passive adsorption to gold at a final concentration of 6 \u00b5g/mL algae-RBD per mL of OD 1.0 gold. After incubation at ambient temperature (22-25\u00b0 C.) for 45 minutes, a solution of 10% bovine serum albumin and 1% polyethylene glycol comprising 5% of the total conjugate volume was added and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 mins under gentle mixing. After incubation the gold conjugate solution was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 30 mins. Without disturbing the pellet, the resulting supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.25) representing 80% of the initial conjugate volume. This process was repeated in two consecutive centrifugation and resuspension steps. A final centrifugation step was performed and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in the remaining supernatant. The RBD labelled gold was then stored overnight at 2-8\u00b0 C. to observe aggregation. Following overnight incubation, algae-RBD gold conjugate was briefly sonicated in a water bath to disperse any gold aggregates. A sample of the gold conjugate was then diluted 1/50 in Tris-HCl pH 9.25, and the absorbance peak was measured. The final OD of the gold conjugate was determined to be 12.8.",

Following lamination onto adhesive lined polyester backing cards, the resulting cards were cut into cut into 5.5 mm strips and placed into the Lumivi commercial housing, packaged in foil pouches with desiccant and stored at ambient temperature for subsequent testing. For comparison purposes a SARs-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain expressed in a human cell line (DAGC174 Creative Diagnostics) was similarly conjugated to colloidal gold as described previously and evaluated in the adapted lateral flow assay. A 15 \u00b5L aliquot each test sample (plasma) was applied to the device sample well followed by three drops of 0.1 M PBS/Tween running buffer (approximately 150 L). After a 15-minute incubation at ambient temperature the test was visually interpreted for the presence of purple/red lines at both the Test and Control marker areas within the devices read window. The devices were scanned with an optical reader (i-Lynx\u2122) and values of 0.055 reflectance units were considered to be visually detectable by untrained operators and are positive. Values below 0.055 reflectance units are scored as negative. A positive control line (indicating proper sample flow within the prototype device) was required before device interpretation could be made."

In the first set of plasmids (pSS1 and pSS2), the RBD coding region was codon-optimized for P. tricornutum (PtRBD) and targeted for secretion using the promoter and secretory signal from the P. tricornutum HASP1 gene (highly abundant secreted protein 1) (Erdene-Ochir et al., 2019) (FIG. 2). pSS1 and pSS2 differ in nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter that are present in different alleles of HASP1. Another plasmid (pSS7) used a human codon optimized RBD coding region (HsRBD) with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein secretory signal. Plasmids were introduced into wild type P. tricornutum or a histidine auxotroph strain (Slattery et al., 2020) from E. coli by conjugation. After isolation of single P. tricornutum clones, retention of the RBD coding region was assessed after 28 days growth in liquid culture. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, diagnostic PCRs on individual clones for the PtRBD coding region indicated no rearrangements in the RBD coding region in the wild type or histidine auxotroph strains of P. tricornutum, whereas the HsRBD appeared stable in only the histidine auxotroph strain. Transcription of the RBD was confirmed by RNAseq for 4 clones of pSS2. Histidine auxotroph strains harbouring three clones of pSS2 (PtRBD) or pSS7 (HsRBD) plasmids were expanded in liquid culture and RBD expression examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-RBD antibody (FIGS. 4A and 4B). One strain of pSS2 revealed robust RBD expression (PtRBD-1) and was chosen for lonf-term growth experiments over 7 months. At 7 months, larger-scale bioreactors (20-L) were seeded with the PtRBD-1 strain, and samples taken for diagnostic PCR and Western blotting for RBD expression. Of the bioreactor cultures sampled for diagnostic PCR, the RBD was present in 10 of the 12 samples (FIG. 5). Western blotting of whole cell lysates revealed robust RBD expression in 8 of 14 bioreactors, and weaker or undetectable expression in the remaining bioreactors (FIG. 5).",

In each case, Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-RBD antibody revealed expression of the RBD fusions, although at varying levels (data not shown). Together, these data show that plasmids with RBD coding regions optimized for expression in P. tricornutum can be maintained in laboratory scale or larger scale cultures for at least 7 months, that robust RBD expression can be detected by RNAseq and by a polyclonal anti-RBD antibody, and that 4 different purification tags are compatible with RBD expression, providing different strategies for purification."

We thus constructed a plasmid (pSS10) where the coding region for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was cloned downstream of a 650-bp sequence containing the HASP1 promoter region (FIG. 6A). Stable P. tricornutum clones harbouring pSS10 were selected, grown in media containing high concentrations of phosphate (100%; about 362 \u00b5M; about 34 ppm) and then diluted into test tubes containing media with phosphate at 5% of normal media levels (5%; about 18.1%; about 1.7 ppm), or with reduced amounts of other media constituents. We examined eGFP expression by Western blotting of whole cell lysates of cultures sampled at different days post inoculation and observed robust expression of eGFP in media that was reduced in phosphate alone (\u201c5% phosphate\u201d), phosphate and iron (\u201c5% phosphate 5% iron\u201d), and phosphate and nitrate (\u201c5% phosphate 5% nitrate\u201d) as early as day 4 in the time course (FIG. 6B). The HASP1-eGFP induction by low phosphate media was replicated with an independent isolate of pSS10 in P. tricornutum (data not shown). As also shown in FIG. 6B, no eGFP expression was detected in strains grown in media reduced in nitrate alone (\u201c5% nitrate\u201d), iron (\u201c5% iron\u201d), or both nitrate and iron (\u201c5% nitrate 5% iron\u201d).",
                                "Interestingly, secreted eGFP was evident after 8 days in supernatants of media with 5% phosphate and 5% iron, and continued to increase over the time course of the experiment (FIG. 6C). In contrast, no secreted eGFP was observed in supernatants of L1 media (Full L1). Limiting phosphate in combination with nitrate, nitrate alone, or nitrate in combination with iron, did not stimulate eGFP secretion to the supernatant (FIG. 6C). The differences in secreted eGFP for these clones many be related to mutations that were identified by whole-plasmid sequencing that likely occurred during conjugation from E. coli to P. tricornutum. Intriguingly, growth curves of P. tricornutum in 5% phosphate and 5% iron revealed no difference to growth in full L1 media, whereas strains grown in media with reductions in other constituents had much slower rates (FIG. 6D). Limiting phosphate in combination with nitrate, nitrate alone, iron alone, or nitrate in combination with iron, did not stimulate eGFP secretion to the supernatant. eGFP secretion to the culture supernatant was observed with 5 other pSS10 clones in 5% phosphate 5% iron media, but not in modified L1 media (FIG. 6E). Collectively, these data show that eGFP secretion was robust in media with reduced phosphate and iron, whereas limiting phosphate alone was sufficient to stimulate eGFP expression from the HASP1 promoter.",
                                "Encouraged by this result, we next tested whether expression of the RBD from the HASP1 promoter was also regulated by limiting phosphate and/or iron. We first tested this by diluting a stationary phase culture of pSS2 into small-scale cultures (10 mL) with fresh L1 media containing different concentrations of added phosphate (0%, 1%, 10% and 100%; corresponding to about 0, 0.34, 3.4, and 34 ppm, respectively). By day 3, RBD expression as observed by Western blotting of whole cell extracts in all cultures except those containing 100% phosphate (FIG. 7A), indicating that the HASP1 promoter was responsive to reduced levels of phosphate with maximal induction between 1 and 10% phosphate.",
                                "We next scaled expression to 5 L to facilitate monitoring of growth rate, RBD expression, phosphate and iron concentration in a bioreactor containing media with our standard L1 media (100% phosphate, about 34 ppm phosphate). For this experiment, we seeded the bioreactor with a culture in a late stationary phase that showed high levels of RBD expression (FIG. 7B, lane 0). As shown in FIG. 7B, RBD levels as indicated by Western blots of whole cell lysates were high at early time points (days 1 and 2), not detected at days 3-8, and then visibly induced by day 9. Reduction of phosphate in the media to below about 0.5 or 1 ppm correlated with the observed maximal RBD expression (FIG. 7C). A similar reduction in iron was also observed (FIG. 7C). Taken together, these data show that the HASP1 promoter can be induced or repressed based on phosphate levels in the culture media, with < 1 ppm phosphate inducing expression. This result also explains why we found that in our modified L1 media, which contains about 34 ppm phosphate or 10 times more than other studies (Erdene-Ochir, 2019), HASP1-driven expression of the RBD was highest in late stationary phase when phosphate depletion to levels necessary for induction occurred, and why our western blot data shows full RBD repression."

However, we found no evidence of secretion of the expressed RBD in culture supernatants, either in small scale cultures or larger bioreactors. Lack of RBD secretion was not due to the HASP1 promoter and secretory peptide, as we observed robust secretion of the HASP1-eGFP construct (FIG. 6C). We also found no evidence of RBD secretion in culture supernatants of strains harbouring pSS7 that expresses a human codon-optimized RBD driven by the P. tricornutum 40SRPS8 constitutive promoter and the native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein secretion signal. Moreover, plasmids expressing algae codon-optimized versions of the full-length spike protein (pSS3-pSS6) also had poor expression levels and we found significant proteolysis of the spike protein as evidenced by mass spectrometry analyses of concentrated cell-free media (data not shown).",
                                "We focused on purifying the 6X-histidine tagged RBD from whole-cell extracts of P. tricornutum using a combination of metal affinity, ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (FIG. 8A). From 5-L bioreactor runs, we achieved RBD yields of 28-34 \u00b5g of RBD. During repeated purification runs, we noted that a significant portion of the expressed RBD was present in the column flow through (~90-95%) (FIG. 8B). Purification under denaturing conditions (6 M urea) did not improve binding to the metal affinity column (data not shown). Interestingly, Western blotting of the column load, lysate, flow through and eluate with anti-HisTag and anti-RBD antibodies showed that the majority of the RBD present in the load and flow through lacked a 6X-histidine tag, providing an explanation for why most of the expressed RBD did not bind the metal affinity column.",
                                "We considered the possibility that the TEV protease site in the algae-RBD construct was a potential substrate for a P. tricornutum protease, thus causing loss of the C-terminal 6X-histidine tag from expressed algae-RBD. Surprisingly, when we deleted the TEV protease site from the construct (pSS72), but retained the C-terminal 6X-histidine tag, the majority of the protein was present in the eluate and not in the flow-through (FIG. 8C), suggesting that the presence of the TEV protease site caused loss of the 6X-histidine tag. Furthermore, RBD constructs lacking a TEV protease site were also present in the supernatant of culture P. tricornutum, suggesting that these RBD constructs were more readily secreted, in comparison to RBD constructs having a TEV protease site (FIGS. 8D and 8E). The finding of enhancing secretion of recombinantly-expressed proteins in P. tricornutum by removal of a TEV protease cleavage site was surprising and significant in that previous studies expressing RBD in algae, such as in Berndt et al., 2021 using green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), were unsuccessful in secreting RBD.",
                                "The identity of the purified algae-RBD was confirmed by mass spectrometry protein identification (FIG. 8F) and by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-RBD antibody (FIG. 9). We noted that the apparent molecular weight of the algae-RBD was lower than that of RBD produced in mammalian cell lines (HEK293) (FIG. 9).",

As shown in FIG. 9, treatment with PNGase F reduced the apparent size of the algae-RBD. A similar treatment of commercially available RBD purified from mammalian cell lines (HEK293-RBD) also reduced the apparent size of the RBD (FIG. 9). The algae-RBD and mammalian RBD do not differ in primary sequence of the recombinant constructs and thus the slight difference in the apparent size of the pre- and post-treated algae-RBD versus mammalian RBD could be due to post-translational modifications other than N-linked glycosylation, including reported O-linked glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Tian et al., 2021). These data, however, are consistent with both RBD preparations containing N-linked glycosylated residues."

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 variants (such as the Delta B.1.617.2 variant) that have enhanced infectivity and/or pathogenicity relative to the parental SARS-CoV-2 strain will likely continue to arise, and it is possible these and other variants will become endemic. Rapid LFAs that utilize recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 antigens are one type of serological test useful for viral exposure monitoring or for determining immune response post-vaccination (Whitman et al., 2020). Widespread use of LFAs will require a scalable source of immunologically reactive viral antigen. Here, we show that the marine diatom P. tricornutum is a viable orthogonal and scalable system for overexpression and purification of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and nucleocapsid, and possibly other viral antigens, for use in pandemic diagnostics. In particular, the minimal biocontainment measures, defined growth media and lack of infectivity by mammalian viruses make P. tricornutum an attractive orthogonal system.",

Thus, the HASP1 promoter is responsive to limiting phosphate conditions and adds to the inducible expression toolbox of P. tricornutum that is currently based on the nitrate reductase promoter (Niu et al., 2013; Chu et al., 2016; Adler-Agnon et al., 2018) and alkaline phosphatase promoter (Lin et al., 2017). Indeed, our data suggest a number of strategies for phosphate- and iron-regulated expression that would be applicable for toxic proteins or for timing expression for particular growth stages.",
                                "We found that overexpressed RBD constructs with a TEV cleavage site was not secreted and was retained intracellularly, while RBD constructs lacking a TEV cleavage site were readily secreted, contrary to observations in Chlamydomonas where the RBD was found to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Berndt et al., 2021). Deleting the TEV protease site from the construct resulted in a substantial increase in yield with no protein visible by western blotting in the metal-affinity column flow-through. Without being bound by theory, one interpretation of this result is that P. tricornutum encodes an endogenous protease that recognizes the TEV protease site and subsequent cleavage releases the C-terminal 6X-histidine tag. The C-terminal 6X-histidine tag could also be lost by pre-mature transcription termination, post-transcriptional processing or pre-mature translation termination. The fact that we could recover some expressed algae-RBD-6X-His containing the TEV protease site suggests that, regardless of the mechanism that removes the C-terminal 6X-histidine tag, it is inefficient or restricted to a particular sub-cellular compartment (e.g., the ER or Golgi). It is not clear from other studies with P. tricornutum if similar issues were observed during purification of histidine-tagged proteins, although proteolytic removal of C-terminal tags from overexpressed proteins has been observed in E. coli (Lykkemark et al., 2014). This data also suggest that different tags may be better suited for expression and purification of the algae-RBD. RBD constructs using GST, Fc, or 10X-His tags were successfully purified in Pt, and cleavage of at least the Fc and GST tags from RBD was observed by Western blot (data not shown), which indicates that different tags may be used with RBD and that TEV-mediated protease cleavage by Pt is not only specific to 6X-His.",
                                "The RBD that we purified from whole cell extracts possessed N-linked glycosylation suggesting that a portion of expressed RBD is transited through the ER/Golgi apparatus and is either secreted at levels too low to be detected in culture supernatants, or is not secreted at all. Although RBD was found to be recalcitrant to secretion when overexpressed, this is not be the case for all proteins, as we found robust secretion of eGFP with the same HASP1 promoter/secretory peptide combination as used for the RBD studies.",
                                "The PtRBD was biologically active in an ACE2 receptor binding inhibition assay and serologically active in a test LFA device where it performed at sensitivities similar to commercially available RBD antigen made in mammalian cell lines. This result demonstrates that P. tricornutum is a viable orthogonal protein expression system to mammalian cell culturing for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viral antigens. P. tricornutum, and other algae, have a number of advantages over mammalian expression systems, foremost being minimal biocontainment requirements, a defined growth media that lacks potentially cross-reactive antigens present in serum needed for cell culturing, insensitivity to infection by mammalian viruses, and a scalability (>10,000 L) that exceeds many mammalian bioreactors. Moreover, the P. tricornutum histidine auxotroph that we used in our experiments alleviates the need for antibiotic selection of plasmids, further reducing the complexity and cost of growth media. An additional advantage of plasmid-based expression systems is the ability to screen through large numbers of potential expression constructs in response to emerging pandemic viral threats."
