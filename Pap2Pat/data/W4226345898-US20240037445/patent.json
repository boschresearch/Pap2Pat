                        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on how intelligent agents ought to perform actions in an environment to maximize the cumulative reward. In RL, a method of rewarding desired behaviors and punishing negative behaviors assigns positive values to the desired actions to encourage the agent and negative values to desired behaviors to discourage the agent. This essentially trains the agent to seek a long-term and maximum overall reward to achieve an optimal solution.",
                        "RL has some advantages over other types of learning, such as supervised learning, in that RL does not require label training data. However, typical training schemes of RL algorithms rely on active interaction with the environments. It limits their applications in domains where active data collection is expensive or dangerous (e.g., autonomous driving). Recently, offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) has emerged as a promising candidate to overcome this barrier. Unlike traditional RL methods, offline-RL learns the policy from a static offline dataset collected without iterative interaction with the environment.",
                        "However, offline RL methods suffer from several issues, such as distributional shift. Unlike online RL algorithms, the state and action distributions are different during training and testing. As a result, RL agents may fail dramatically after being deployed online. For example, in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, overconfident and catastrophic extrapolations may occur in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Described are systems and methods for performing pessimistic offline RL. Offline RL requires learning skills from previously collected data sets without any active environment interaction. As such, offline RL allows for utilizing previously collected datasets from various sources, including human demonstrations, prior experiments, domain-specific solutions, and even data from different but related problems, to build complex decision-making engines. However, offline RL requires handling distributional shifts, making it difficult to learn from a fixed data set effectively.",
                        "The systems and methods described herein for performing pessimistic offline RL limit the policy from visiting unseen states and actions. Broadly, the pessimistic offline RL systems and methods limit the magnitude of the value function at unseen states so that the agent can avoid or recover from unseen states by detecting out of distribution (OOD) states and shaping the value function at those OOD states.",
                        "To provide further background regarding RL, reference is made to FIG. 1, which illustrates a prior art traditional online RL learning process flow 10. Here, illustrated as a policy 12 and an environment 14. The policy 12 generally defines an agent's way of behaving at a given time. The environment 14 is the environment in which the agent operates within. When the agent performs a particular action 16 based on the policy 12, a change of state 18 occurs, and reward 20 is generated. Based on this reward 20, the policy 12 is updated to generate a new policy 22, which the agent in subsequent episodes then utilizes to determine what types of actions should be performed. Over time, as the agent interacts with the environment, the agent gathers data for learning each skill and task and updates its policy accordingly.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2, one example of a process flow 100 for offline RL is illustrated. Offline RL is similar to online RL but differs in at least one aspect. Moreover, instead of having the agent interact with the environment 14, the policy 12 is trained offline using data from a data set 121 to generate an updated policy 122. Eventually, after it is fully trained, the updated policy 122 may then be deployed in the real world 130. Real-world applications for utilizing the updated policy 122 can include any one of several different uses. For example, the updated policy 122 can be utilized in robotic applications, such as robotic control and/or autonomous vehicles.",
                        "In particular, Q-Learning may be used for offline RL. Q-Learning uses a table to store all Q-Values of all possible state-action pairs possible. Q-Values may also be estimated by a continuous function when the state space is continuous. In one example, the table can be updated dynamic programming, such as the Bellman update, while action selection is usually made with an \u03b5-greedy policy. Q-Values measure the overall expected reward assuming the agent is in state s and performs action a, and then continues playing until the end of the episode following some policy \u03c0.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 3, one example of a pessimistic offline RL system 200 is shown. In this example, the pessimistic offline RL system 200 includes one or more processor(s) 202, one or more data store(s) 204 that is in communication with the processor(s) 102, and a memory 206 that is also in communication with the processor(s) 202. Accordingly, the processor(s) 202 may be a part of the pessimistic offline RL system 200 or the pessimistic offline RL system 200 may access the processor(s) 202 through a data bus or another communication path. In one or more embodiments, the processor(s) 202 may be an application-specific integrated circuit that is configured to implement functions associated with an offline learning module 208. In general, the processor(s) 202 are an electronic processor such as a microprocessor that is capable of performing various functions as described herein.",
                        "As stated before, the pessimistic offline RL system 200 may include a memory 206 that stores the offline learning module 208. The memory 206 may be a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard disk drive, a flash memory, or other suitable memory for storing the offline learning module 208. The offline learning module 208 is, for example, computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor(s) 202, cause the processor(s) 202 to perform the various functions disclosed herein.",
                        "With regards to the data store(s) 204, the data store(s) 204 are, in one embodiment, an electronic data structure such as a database that is stored in the memory 206 or another memory and that is configured with routines that can be executed by the processor(s) 202 for analyzing stored data, providing stored data, organizing stored data, and so on. Thus, in one embodiment, the data store(s) 112 stores data used by the offline learning module 208 in executing various functions.",
                        "In one embodiment, the data store(s) 112 includes a policy (\u03c0) 212 and a dataset () 221. The policy (\u03c0) 212 is, in one example, a mapping from some state s to the probabilities of selecting each possible action a given that state. As such, policy (\u03c0) 212 generally dictates the action to be taken by an agent at a particular state. The dataset () 221 generally contains transitions that have been observed by having the agent that utilizes the policy (\u03c0) 212 perform an action that moves it from one state to another. As such, the dataset () contains the transitions between different states. States that are part of the dataset () are considered seen or in-distribution states, while states that are not part of the dataset () are considered unseen or OOD states. As mentioned previously, offline RL methods suffer from several issues, such as distributional shift. Moreover, the state and action distributions are different during training and testing. As a result, RL agents may fail dramatically after being deployed online.",
                        "Concerning the offline learning module 208, the offline learning module 208 includes instructions that, when executed by the processor(s) 202, cause the processor(s) 202 to perform pessimistic offline RL as will be described in greater detail in this description, the offline learning module 208 causes the processor(s) 202 limit the policy (\u03c0) 212 from visiting unseen states and actions. This is accomplished by limiting the magnitude of the value function at unseen states so that the agent can avoid or recover from unseen states by detecting out of distribution (OOD) states and shaping the value function at those OOD states.",
                        "Here, the offline learning module 208 includes instructions that, when executed by the processor(s) 202, cause the processor(s) 202 to sample states over a whole state space. The sampling of states over a whole state space can include states that are OOD and in-distribution states. As mentioned previously, in-distribution states are states that are within the dataset () 221, while OOD states are states that are not within the dataset () 221.",

Moreover, an appropriate distribution d\u03d5(s), which requires a tool for OOD state detection should be utilized. In one example, the offline learning module 208 cause the processor(s) 202 to train a bag of dynamics models ({circumflex over (P)}1, {circumflex over (P)}2, . . . {circumflex over (P)}n) according to transitions within a dataset () 221 to output an uncertainty estimation model that indicates when the present state is the OOD state.",

It penalizes the softmax value over the state space but also considers the distances between sample points and the training data. The two terms following the trade-off factor \u03b5 is trying to decrease the discrepancy between the softmax value over OOD states and the average value over in-distribution states. The equation enforces the learned value function to output higher values at in-distribution states and lower values at OOD states. The log sumexp of the above equation mitigates the requirement for an accurate uncertainty estimation \u03b6(s) over the entire state space.
