    "abstract": "Recombinant genetic constructs and strains of H. polymorpha having significantly increased ethanol productivity with a simultaneous decreased production of xylitol during high-temperature xylose fermentation are disclosed. The constructs include a H. polymorpha XYL1 gene encoding xylose reductase mutated to decrease affinity of the enzyme toward NADPH. The modified version of XYL1 gene under control of a strong constitutive HpGAP promoter was overexpressed in a \u0394xyll background. A recombinant H. polymorpha strain overexpressing the mutated enzyme together with native xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase in the \u0394xyll background was also constructed. Xylose consumption, ethanol and xylitol production by the constructed strain were evaluated during high-temperature xylose fermentation (48\u00b0 C.). A significant increase in ethanol productivity (up to 7.4 times) was shown in the recombinant strain as compared with the wild type strain. Moreover, the xylitol production by the recombinant strain was reduced considerably: 0.9 mg\u03c7 (L\u03c7h)\u22121 versus 4.2 mg\u03c7 (Lxh)\u22121 by the wild type strain.",

                        "Ethanol produced from lignocellulosics is an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. As a substantial fraction of lignocellulose material consists of xylose, it is necessary to ferment efficiently xylose to ethanol to make the process cost-effective [1].",
                        "Some yeasts, filamentous fungi and bacteria are able to convert xylose to ethanol. Yeasts and most of other fungi first reduce xylose to xylitol using xylose reductase, which strongly prefers NADPH as coenzyme, EC 1.1.1.21 (XR). Then they oxidize xylitol to xylulose with strictly NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.9 (XDH) [2]. The difference in cofactor specificity results in redox imbalance that leads to decreasing ethanol production and accumulation of xylitol [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The xylitol production has been reduced by metabolic engineering directed to optimize the expression levels of XR and XDH [9, 10, 11, 12], change the cofactor specificity of XR from NADPH to NADH [13, 13a], or modify the redox metabolism of the host cell [14, 15, 16]. The other used approach to bypass redox imbalance during xylose fermentation was based on expression of fungal or bacterial xylose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.5 (XI) which converts xylose directly to xylulose and does not require redox cofactors [17, 18]",
                        "The additional overexpression of xylulokinase, EC 2.7.1.17 (XK) (the third enzyme in the xylose metabolism) that converts xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate, which enters the pentose phosphate pathway and then into the central metabolism, has been shown to enhance both aerobic and anaerobic xylose utilization in XR-XDH- as well as XI carrying strains [12, 19]. Overexpression of XK is necessary to overcome the naturally low expression level of this enzyme [3, 5]. The overexpression resulted in more efficient conversion of xylose to ethanol [5, 20].",
                        "The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha is capable of alcoholic fermentation of xylose at elevated temperatures (45-48\u00b0 C.) [21, 22, 23]. This property of H. polymorpha makes it a good candidate for use in an efficient process of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). SSF combines enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material with subsequent fermentation of released sugars in the same vessel. Major advantages of exploring the utility of H. polymorpha for ethanol production from cellulosic material using are this yeast has (i) well developed methods of molecular genetics and (ii) the availability of a whole genome sequence for a model strain CBS4732 [24; 25]."

Concentrations of xylitol in medium were determined enzymaticaly as described earlier (Enzymatic determination of D-sorbitol and xylitol, R-Biopharm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) with slight modifications. Nitrotetrazolium Blue (NTB) 12 mM and phenazine methosulfate 15 mM were used instead iodonitrotetrazolium chloride and diaphorase, respectively. The absorbance of the reduced NTB was measured at 570 nm. Concentrations of xylose from fermentation in mineral medium were analyzed by chemical method as was described before [32].",

The transformants were grown on YPD medium supplemented with zeocin. The presence of expression cassettes in the transformants was examined by PCR using corresponding primers. To express the XK, the recombinant plasmid pGLG61/HpXYL3 was transformed into the recipient strain H. polymorpha overexpressing native or modified versions of XR and XDH. The transformants were grown on YPD medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of G418. The highest concentration of G418, which allows the transformants to grow, was 0.4 mg\u00d7ml\u22121. Colonies able to grow on the selective medium appeared after 3 days of incubation with frequency of up to 20 transformants\u00d7mg\u22121 DNA.

The specific activity of XR with NADH in both strains remained unchanged. Strains XRn/XDH and XRm/XDH with additional overexpressing XDH possessed two-fold increase in the specific activity of XDH compared with the wild type strain.

                        "As was described earlier [6], natural xylose-utilizing yeasts display alcoholic fermentation only when their XR possessed NADH-linked activity. The XR of H. polymorpha belongs to enzymes with dual cofactor specificity, however NADPH is strongly preferred (>10-fold). In the present case, we focused our efforts on engineering the XR with increased KM for NADPH. Lysine and asparagine residues were substituted for arginine and aspartic acid, respectively, at the positions 341 and 343 in the frame of cofactor binding site using the site-specific mutagenesis, according to data for the XR gene of C. tenuis [33]. The modified version of XR gene under control of the strong constitutive HpGAP promoter was overexpressed on the \u0394xyl1 background. It resulted in significant increase of KM for NADPH, while KM for NADH remained nearly unchanged. Obtained results are in good agreement with reported features of modified XR from C. tenuis [33]. The constructed XRm strain showed a slight increase in ethanol productivity as compared to the wild type strain, while the overexpression of native XR had no positive effect. Xylitol production of these strains varied insignificantly. It has to be emphasized that mutated XR reveals significantly lower specific activity with NADPH which resulted in increase of ethanol productivity of the XRm. For further improvement of ethanol production, XDH was expressed together with the modified XR. Overexpression of enzymes for initial two stages of xylose utilization pathway resulted in the 2.4-fold improvement of ethanol productivity accompanied by the 2.6-fold decrease of xylitol production.",
                        "In our previous work we developed H. polymorpha strains co-overexpressing E. coli XI and own XK. The strains were characterized with significant improvement of ethanol production during xylose fermentation [23]. In the present study, the constructed strain XRm/XDH/XK overexpressing the modified XR together with XDH and XK is characterized with significant increase in ethanol productivity (up to 7.4 times) as compared to the wild type strain. Importantly, xylitol production by this strain is reduced considerably: 0.9 mg\u00d7(L\u00d7h)\u22121 versus 4.2 mg\u00d7(L\u00d7h)\u22121 by the wild type strain. Additional overexpression of XDH and XDH together with XK led to a gradual increase in ethanol productivity and simultaneously a decrease in xylitol production. It may be assumed that the initial stages of xylose utilization are limiting in alcoholic fermentation of xylose in H. polymorpha. In FIG. 3, the fermentation profiles of XRm/XDH/XK and XRn/XDH/XK are represented. The consumption of xylose by both constructed H. polymorpha strains and the wild type strain during the fermentation was rather low (FIG. 3). This may suggest that xylose uptake in H. polymorpha is quite inefficient and corresponding genes coding putative xylose transporters should be cloned and overexpressed. In addition, bottlenecks downstream of XR cannot be excluded and arrant further investigation. The fermentation profile revealed reutilization of synthesized ethanol. The reason of this phenomenon is not understood. In another study the present inventors have isolated a H. polymorpha 2EtOH- mutant which is characterized by significant decrease in synthesized ethanol consumption (Ishchuk et al., unpublished). The molecular nature of the corresponding mutation, however, remains unknown.",
                        "Recombinant strains of H. polymorpha constructed in this study showed significant increase in ethanol productivity during high-temperature xylose fermentation. On the other hand, ethanol production from xylose is still very low as compared to the best current xylose fermenting strains [13a, 17, 34]. Therefore, further efforts have to be applied to improve the xylose alcoholic fermentation in the thermotolerant yeast H. polymorpha."

The same construction integrated into the chromosome of a H. polymorpha strain that a over expresses the H. polymorpha pyruvate decarboxylase gene PDC1, but lacking the \u0394xyl deletion also increases ethanol fermentation from xylose by nearly a factor of three. It is therefore expected that the combination of overexpression of the PDC1 gene and the mutated XR gene in a H. polymorpha strain also carrying the \u0394xyl deletion will enhance ethanol production from xylose even further."

A recombinant H. polymorpha strain comprising at least one recombinant nucleic acid that singularly or in combination, includes at least one gene encoding a xylitol dehydrogenase enzyme, at least one gene encoding a xylose reductase enzyme having a higher binding affinity for NAD(H) than for NADP(H), and at least one gene encoding a xylulokinase enzyme, each of said genes being operably linked to at least one promoter that overexpresses said genes in said H. polymorpha strain and where said recombinant H. polymorpha strain produces a greater amount of ethanol when fermented in a media containing xylose than a parent H. polymorpha strain not containing said genes.",
        "2. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 wherein each of said genes of the recombinant nucleic acid is integrated into the H. polymorpha chromosome.",
        "3. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 wherein the H. polymorpha strain has a mutation rendering at least one native gene encoding a xylose reductase inoperable.",
        "4. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 wherein each of said genes is over expressed in the H. polymorpha strain relative to the parent H. polymorpha strain.",
        "5. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 further comprising at least one sequence encoding a pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme operably linked to a promoter that overexpresses said pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme in the recombinant H. polymorpha strain.",
        "6. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 wherein at least one promoter comprises a HpGAP promoter obtained from H. polymorpha.",
        "7. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 wherein the recombinant xylose reductase gene is a mutant of a native H. polymorpha xylose reductase gene.",
        "8. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 7 wherein the xylose reductase gene has a mutation in the native H. polymorpha xylose reductase gene that changes a first codon encoding lysine at position 341 to a codon that encodes arginine and a mutation that changes a second codon expressing asparagine at position 343 to a codon the encodes aspartic acid.",
        "9. A process for making ethanol comprising growing the recombinant H. polymorpha strain of claim 1 in a media comprising xylose under conditions that cause the recombinant H. polymorpha to make ethanol.",
        "10. A recombinant nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a xylose reductase gene from H. polymorpha.",
        "11. The recombinant nucleic acid of claim 10 wherein the sequence encoding the xylose reductase encodes an NADPH/NADH binding domain according to SEQ. ID NO: 1.",
        "12. The recombinant nucleic acid of claim 10 wherein the sequence encoding the xylose reductase encodes an NADPH/NADH binding domain according to SEQ. ID NO: 2.",
        "13. The recombinant nucleic acid of claim 10 according to SEQ. ID NO: 3.",
        "14. The recombinant nucleic acid of claim 10 that encodes a protein according to SEQ. ID NO: 4.",
        "15. The recombinant nucleic acid of claim 10 that encodes a protein according to SEQ. ID NO: 4 except having a mutation in the NADPH/NADH binding domain according to SEQ. ID NO: 2."
