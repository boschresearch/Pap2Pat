    "title": "Engineering of xylose reductase and overexpression of xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase improves xylose alcoholic fermentation in the thermotolerant yeast Hansenula polymorpha",
    "date": "2008-07-23",
    "abstract": "Background The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha is capable of alcoholic fermentation of xylose at elevated temperatures (45 \u2013 48\u00b0C). Such property of this yeast defines it as a good candidate for the development of an efficient process for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. However, to be economically viable, the main characteristics of xylose fermentation of H. polymorpha have to be improved. Results Site-specific mutagenesis of H. polymorpha XYL1 gene encoding xylose reductase was carried out to decrease affinity of this enzyme toward NADPH. The modified version of XYL1 gene under control of the strong constitutive HpGAP promoter was overexpressed on a \u0394xyl1 background. This resulted in significant increase in the K M for NADPH in the mutated xylose reductase (K341 \u2192 R N343 \u2192 D), while K M for NADH remained nearly unchanged. The recombinant H. polymorpha strain overexpressing the mutated enzyme together with native xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase on \u0394xyl1 background was constructed. Xylose consumption, ethanol and xylitol production by the constructed strain were determined for high-temperature xylose fermentation at 48\u00b0C. A significant increase in ethanol productivity (up to 7.3 times) was shown in this recombinant strain as compared with the wild type strain. Moreover, the xylitol production by the recombinant strain was reduced considerably to 0.9 mg \u00d7 (L \u00d7 h) -1 as compared to 4.2 mg \u00d7 (L \u00d7 h) -1 for the wild type strain. Conclusion Recombinant strains of H. polymorpha engineered for improved xylose utilization are described in the present work. These strains show a significant increase in ethanol productivity with simultaneous reduction in the production of xylitol during high-temperature xylose fermentation.",

                "Fuel ethanol produced from lignocellulosics is an environmentally friendly alternative liquid fuel to petroleum derived transportation liquid fuels. Xylose represents a significant constituent of the hemicellulose xylan fraction of lignocellulosics. Due to this, it is necessary to ferment xylose efficiently to ethanol to improve process economics for the production of this renewable liquid fuel [1].",
                "Some yeasts, filamentous fungi and bacteria are able to convert xylose to ethanol. Yeasts and most other fungi first reduce xylose to xylitol using xylose reductase, EC 1.1.1.21 (XR). This enzyme has strong preference for NADPH as a co-factor. In the following step, xylitol is oxidized to xylulose with a strictly NAD-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.9 (XDH) [2]. The difference in cofactor specificity in the first steps for xylose metabolism results in cofactor imbalance with reduced ethanol production and accumulation of xylitol [3-8]. Xylitol production can be reduced by metabolic engineering approaches directed to optimize the expression levels of XR and XDH [9-12], by changing the cofactor specificity of XR from NADPH to NADH [13,14], or by modifying the redox metabolism of the host cell [15-17]. Another approach used to bypass redox imbalance during xylose fermentation relies on the expression of fungal or bacterial xylose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.5 (XI) thereby directly converting xylose to xylulose with no requirement for NADPH or NADH as cofactors [18,19]. In the subsequent step, xylulose conversion can be further streamlined through the overexpression of xylulokinase, EC 2.7.1.17 (XK) (the third enzyme in the xylose metabolism that converts xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate). The C5 sugar, xylulose-5-phosphate, is the entry point to the pentose phosphate pathway and into central metabolism. The overexpression of xylulokinase has been shown to enhance both aerobic and anaerobic xylose utilization in XR-XDH \u2013 as well as XI-carrying strains [5,20]. Overexpression of XK is necessary to overcome the naturally low expression level of this enzyme [3,5] and has been shown to result in more efficient conversion of xylose to ethanol [5,21].",
                "The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha is capable for alcoholic fermentation of xylose at elevated temperatures (45 \u2013 48\u00b0C) [22-24]. Such property of the yeast defines it as a good candidate for use in efficient process of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). This process combines enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material with subsequent fermentation of released sugars in the same vessel. Among the major advantages for this yeast using are (i) well developed methods of molecular genetics and (ii) availability of genome sequence for the type strain CBS4732 [25,26].",

Xylose consumption, ethanol and xylitol production of this strain in comparison with those of strains overexpressing the native XR, XDH and XK are presented."

                "As described earlier [6], natural xylose-utilizing yeasts display alcoholic fermentation only when their native XR possessed NADH-linked activity. The XR of H. polymorpha belongs to enzymes with dual cofactor specificity, however NADPH is strongly preferred (>10-fold over NADH). In the present study, we focused our efforts on engineering an XR with increased KM for NADPH. Lysine and asparagine residues were substituted for arginine and aspartic acid, respectively, at the positions 341 and 343 in the cofactor binding site using the site-specific mutagenesis, based on sequence data of XR gene of C. tenuis [34]. The modified version of XR gene under control of the strong constitutive HpGAP promoter was overexpressed on the \u0394xyl1 background. This resulted in significant increase of KM for NADPH, while KM for NADH remained nearly unchanged. The results are in good agreement with reported features of modified XR from C. tenuis [34]. The constructed XRm strain showed a slight increase in ethanol productivity as compared to the wild type strain, while the overexpression of native XR had no positive effect. Xylitol production of these strains varied insignificantly. The cloned mutated XR gene results in significant lower specific activity with NADPH and in an increase in ethanol productivity of the host strain. To enable further improvement in ethanol production, XDH was expressed together with the modified XR. Overexpression of enzymes for initial two stages of xylose utilization pathway resulted in a 2.4-fold improvement of ethanol productivity accompanied by a 2.6-fold decrease in xylitol production.",
                "In our previous work we developed H. polymorpha strains co-overexpressing E. coli XI and own XK. These strains were characterized by significant improvement of ethanol production during xylose fermentation [24]. In present study, the constructed strain XRm/XDH/XK overexpressing the modified XR together with XDH and XK is characterized with significant increase in ethanol productivity (up to 7.3 times) as compared to the wild type strain. It is worth mentioning that xylitol production by this strain is reduced considerably: 0.9 mg \u00d7 (L \u00d7 h)-1 versus 4.2 mg \u00d7 (L \u00d7 h)-1 by the wild type strain. Additional overexpression of XDH and XDH together with XK led to gradual increase in ethanol productivity and simultaneously decrease in xylitol production. It could be assumed that the initial stages of xylose utilization are limiting in alcoholic fermentation of xylose in H. polymorpha. The fermentation profiles of XRm/XDH/XK and XRn/XDH/XK are represented in Figure 3. The consumption of xylose by both constructed H. polymorpha strains and the wild type strain during the fermentation was rather low (Figure 3). This may suggest that xylose uptake in H. polymorpha is quite inefficient and corresponding genes coding putative xylose transporters should be cloned and overexpressed. In addition, bottlenecks downstream of XR cannot be excluded but this has to be determined. The fermentation profile revealed reutilization of synthesized ethanol. The reason of this phenomenon is not understood. We have isolated H. polymorpha 2EtOH-mutant which is characterized by significant decrease in synthesized ethanol consumption (Ishchuk et al., unpublished). The molecular nature of the corresponding mutation, however, remains unknown.",
                "Recombinant strains of H. polymorpha constructed in this study showed significant increase in ethanol productivity during high-temperature xylose fermentation. On the other hand, ethanol production from xylose is still very low as compared to the best current xylose fermenting strains [14,18,35]. Therefore, further efforts have to be applied to improve the xylose alcoholic fermentation in the thermotolerant yeast H. polymorpha."
