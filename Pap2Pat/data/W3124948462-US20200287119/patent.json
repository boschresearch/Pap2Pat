                        "As is well known, if you cool many metals and alloys to very low temperatures (e.g., within 20 degrees or so of absolute zero), a phase transition occurs. At this \u201ccritical temperature,\u201d the metal transitions from what is considered a normal state, where it has electrical resistance, to a superconducting state, where there is essentially no resistance to the flow of direct electrical current. What occurs is that the electrons in the metal become paired; above the critical temperature, the net interaction between two electrons is repulsive, but below the critical temperature, the overall interaction between two electrons becomes slightly attractive, a result of an interaction between the electrons and the ionic lattice of the metal. This very slight attraction allows the electrons to drop into a lower energy state, opening up an energy gap. Because of the energy gap and the lower energy state, electrons can move freely without being scattered by the ions of the lattice.",
                        "It is to be understood that the term \u201cmetal\u201d is used above from a physics perspective to refer to those elements having a partially filled conduction band and having lower resistance toward lower temperature. Thus, a superconducting metal silicide would also be considered a metal.",
                        "A Josephson junction is a quantum mechanical device which is comprised of two superconducting electrodes separated by a thin barrier (e.g., insulating tunnel barrier, non-superconducting metal, semiconductor, ferromagnet, etc.). The devices are named after Brian Josephson, who predicted in 1962 that pairs of superconducting electrons could essentially \u201ctunnel\u201d through the non-superconducting barrier from one superconductor to another. Electronic circuits can be built from Josephson junctions, especially digital logic circuitry. Many researchers are working on building ultrafast computers using Josephson logic.",
                        "Superconducting solid-state electronic circuits based on Josephson-effect nonlinear oscillators may be used in qubit implementations for quantum computing. Aluminum may be the desired superconductor despite having a relatively low superconducting transition temperature (TC) (e.g., about 1.2 degrees Kelvin) and narrow superconducting energy gap (e.g., about 44 gigahertz (GHz)). A transmon is a type of superconducting charge qubit that was designed to have reduced sensitivity to charge noise. A transmon device architecture implemented using aluminum (Al)/aluminum oxide (AlOx)/Al junctions, has been studied and is the basis of current qubit technology. However, conventional transmon implementations have limited prospects for scaling. Moreover, achieving high quality superconductor-silicon interfaces, and identifying compatible superconductors with higher TC and other tunable attributes, remains a challenge."

However, conventional transmon implementations, which may form the basis of qubit technology, generally have limited prospects for scaling.

By way of illustration only and without limitation, one or more of the accompanying figures depict exemplary processing steps/stages in the fabrication of a superconducting qubit device structure according to embodiments of the invention.",
                        "Although the overall fabrication method and the structures formed thereby are entirely novel, certain individual processing steps required to implement the method may utilize conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques and conventional semiconductor fabrication tooling. These techniques and tooling will already be familiar to those having ordinary skill in the relevant arts given the teachings herein. Moreover, many of the processing steps and tooling used to fabricate semiconductor devices are also described in a number of readily available publications, including, for example: P. H. Holloway et al., Handbook of Compound Semiconductors: Growth, Processing, Characterization, and Devices, Cambridge University Press, 2008; and R. K. Willardson et al., Processing and Properties of Compound Semiconductors, Academic Press, 2001, which are both hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes. It is emphasized that while some individual processing steps are set forth herein, those steps are merely illustrative, and one skilled in the art may be familiar with several equally suitable alternatives that would also fall within the scope of the invention.",
                        "It is to be appreciated that the various layers and/or regions shown in the accompanying figures may not be drawn to scale. Furthermore, one or more semiconductor layers of a type commonly used in such semiconductor devices may not be explicitly shown in a given figure to facilitate a clearer description. This does not imply that the semiconductor layer(s) not explicitly shown are omitted in the actual device.",
                        "FIG. 1 conceptually illustrates an exemplary transition metal silicide thin film fabrication process by metal-silicon thermal diffusion over a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Specifically, the transition metal silicide thin film fabrication process involves forming a structure 100 which includes a substrate 102, which may comprise doped or undoped crystalline silicon (Si), an insulating layer 104 disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the substrate 102, and a silicon layer 106 disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the insulating layer 104. The insulating layer 104, which may comprise silicon dioxide (SiO2) or an alternative dielectric or oxide material, in conjunction with the silicon layer 106 may, in one or more embodiments, form at least a portion of an SOI wafer; the silicon layer 106 may be a device layer of an SOI wafer. The structure 100 further includes a metal layer 108, which preferably comprises a transition metal, disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the silicon layer 106.",
                        "The substrate 102 may be a base silicon substrate which, in one or more embodiments, comprises a back gate region (e.g., 302 in FIG. 3 or 402 in FIG. 4). Although embodiments of the invention are not limited to any particular dimensions for the respective layers, the substrate 102 may be thicker than the other layers disposed, directly or indirectly, on the substrate (e.g., insulating layer 104, silicon layer 106 and metal layer 108). The substrate 102 may comprise a single crystalline semiconductor material such as silicon (and may therefore be referred to as a silicon wafer), or the substrate may comprise alternate materials, which may or may not be combined with silicon. Alternate materials suitable for use as a substrate include, but are not limited to, germanium, indium antimonide, lead telluride, indium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium arsenide, gallium antimonide, indium gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium indium phosphide, etc. Although a few examples of suitable materials from which the substrate 102 may be formed are described herein, any material that may serve as a foundation upon which a superconductor qubit device can be built similarly falls within the spirit and scope of the present silicide-based qubit device.",
                        "The insulating layer 104 disposed on the substrate 102 may, in one or more embodiments, be grown or deposited on the upper surface of the substrate. In the case of a silicon substrate 102, for example, the insulating layer 104 formed is silicon dioxide; the silicon dioxide may form a layer disposed atop the silicon substrate of the SOI wafer. Alternate oxides may be grown (e.g., using an epitaxial growth process) or deposited (e.g., using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), etc.); deposition is preferably used in cases where the substrate includes materials other than silicon. The insulating layer 104 may be grown to a thickness of between about 10 Angstroms (\u212b) and 500 (\u212b), more preferably between about 25 (\u212b) and 250 (\u212b), in one or more embodiments. Methods of growing or depositing an insulating layer on a semiconductor substrate are well known, as will become apparent to those skilled in the art.",
                        "The metal layer 108 preferably comprises a transition metal, such as, but not limited to, titanium, tantalum, platinum, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, or alloys thereof. In one or more embodiments, the metal layer preferably comprises a superconducting metal, such as, for example, vanadium, aluminum or barium. The metal layer 108 is preferably deposited on the upper surface of the silicon layer 106 using a standard deposition process (e.g., PECVD, CVD, sputtering, etc.).",
                        "Once the metal layer 108 is formed on the silicon layer 106, the structure 100 is subjected to thermal processing 110, such as annealing (e.g., rapid thermal anneal (RTA)) or the like, to form a silicide layer 112 in the resulting structure 150. As will be known by those skilled in the art, the silicide formation technique involves directly depositing a refractory metal on a silicon surface to form the required silicide layer through a process of direct metallurgical reaction. After the metal is deposited on the silicon, the structure is exposed to high temperatures (e.g., about 200-1000 degrees Celsius) that promote chemical reactions between the metal and the silicon needed to form the silicide.",
                        "In such a metallurgical reaction, metal-rich silicides generally form first, and continue to grow until all the metal is consumed. When the metal has been consumed, silicides of lower metal content start appearing, which can continue to grow simply by consuming the metal-rich silicides. Silicide formation by direct metallurgical reaction consumes silicon from the silicon layer 106 onto which the metal layer 108 was placed. A treatment of thermal annealing may be conducted at prescribed temperatures, for prescribed durations of time, under a prescribed gas or gas mixture, and other parameters sufficient to render thermal diffusion of the metal into the underlying silicon layer of the SOI wafer. The temperature used for thermal annealing is typically a function of the type of metal employed, and generally ranges from about 200 to 800 degrees Celsius, depending on the melting point of the metal.",
                        "In other embodiments of the invention, the silicide layer 112 can be formed using alternative technologies known by those skilled in the art, such as, for example, co-evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, or epitaxial growth. Co-evaporation involves the simultaneous deposition of metal and silicon under high-vacuum conditions. The metal and silicon are vaporized through one of several possible heating techniques (e.g., by an electron beam, radio frequency (RF) induction, laser, or resistive heating). Sputtering is a deposition process whereby atoms or molecules are ejected from a target material by high-energy particle bombardment so that the ejected atoms or molecules condense on the surface of a substrate as a thin film. Sputtering of silicides comes in various forms, including sputtering from two targets using multi-pass sputtering systems to achieve a prescribed mixture of metal and silicon in a layered structure. Sintering then completes the chemical reaction between the metal and silicon to form the silicide. Chemical vapor deposition of silicide involves chemical reactions between vapors to form a silicide film. Epitaxially grown silicides belong to a special class of silicides that exhibit a definite orientation relationship with respect to the underlying silicon layer. A silicide is expected to grow epitaxially on silicon if the crystal structures are similar and the lattice mismatch between them is small. For example, nickel silicide (NiSi2) and cobalt silicide (CoSi2) can be grown in single-crystal form on silicon.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the metal layer 108 comprises a transition metal, such as, for example, vanadium (V). After thermal processing 110, the silicide layer 112 comprises a TMSi, such as vanadium silicide (V3Si). The coherent, epitaxial growth of transition metal silicides directly, on silicon suggests that it may be possible to achieve high-quality superconductor-silicon interfaces. The TMSi as used in a device and method according to embodiments of the invention may include known superconductors, such as, for example, V3Si, A15 phases of intermetallic compounds (e.g., M3Si, where M is a transition metal), \u03b1-ThSi2 disilicides (e.g., LaSi2, CaSi2), B31-type monosilicides (e.g., palladium silicide (PdSi), platinum silicide (PtSi), rhodium silicide (RhSi), etc.), as well as other superconductors. Some superconductors may display a relatively high superconducting transition temperature (for example, 17 K for V3Si).",
                        "The present synthesis of the superconducting phase may be demonstrated by electrical transport measurement, showing a critical superconducting transition temperature, TC, of about 14 degrees kelvin (K) for a V3Si film, as shown in FIG. 2. More particularly, FIG. 2 is a graph depicting a plot of resistance (R), in units of ohms (\u03a9), as a function of temperature (T), in units of degrees kelvin (K), for an exemplary film that features a clean V3Si/silicon dioxide (SiO2) interface, for 20 millikelvin per second (mk/s) and 10 mk/s cooling rates. As apparent from FIG. 2, the V3Si film exhibits a superconducting transition temperature of about 14 K. The V3Si film has a similar but slightly lower critical temperature as its bulk phase (about 17 K).",
                        "Built upon a first part of the present synthesis of a structure including a TMSi film, an example of which was previously described in conjunction with FIG. 1, a second part according to aspects of the invention involves fabricating Josephson junctions based on transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide (e.g., TMSi/silicon/TMSi) heterojunctions. The term \u201cheterojunction\u201d as used herein can be broadly defined as an interface that occurs between two layers or regions of dissimilar crystalline semiconductor materials having unequal band gaps. Multiple heterojunctions can be integrated together to form a hetero structure, although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably.",
                        "According to aspects of the invention, each of two islands of TMSi may be separated by a weak link of intrinsic silicon (i-Si) or doped silicon (or another doped or undoped semiconductor material), which in one or more embodiments is about 5-500 nanometers (nm) in length, juxtaposed between the two islands (e.g., as raised regions). The weak link of intrinsic or doped silicon may form a channel between the two TMSi islands. It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific dimensions or types of materials used to form the TMSi islands or channel.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a perspective view depicting an exemplary structure 300 for a transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide (e.g., TMSi/Si/TMSi) Josephson junction, according to an embodiment of the invention. This structure 300 can be used, for example, as a silicide-based qubit device in a quantum computing application. With reference to FIG. 3, the structure 300 includes a substrate or gate back 302, which may comprise doped silicon, an insulating layer 304, which comprises an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, or various other possible oxides) in one or more embodiments, disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the substrate or gate back, and a heterojunction fabricated in accordance with aspects of the present invention, including a silicon (Si) layer 306, which may be either doped or intrinsic, sandwiched laterally between a first TMSi layer 308 and a second TMSi layer 310, the heterojunction being disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the insulating layer 304. In the device structure 300, the TMSi layers 308, 310 are formed in the same plane as the silicon layer 306, and therefore the transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide Josephson junction is configured having a vertical interface.",
                        "The insulating layer 304, in one or more embodiments, comprises an oxide material, such as, for example, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, tantalum oxide, or various other possible oxides. Alternatively, the insulating layer 304 may comprise a high dielectric constant (high-k) material, such as, for example, oxides of tantalum, zirconium, aluminum, titanium, lanthanum, ceramics, or combinations thereof. When the substrate 302 is a gate back, the insulating layer 304 disposed on the gate back may be considered a gate oxide layer. In one or more embodiments, the insulating layer 304 has a thickness ranging from about 1 nm to 10 nm. In other embodiments, the insulating layer 304 has a thickness ranging from about 1.5 nm to 2.5 nm. It is to be understood, however, that embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific thickness of the insulating layer 304. In one or more embodiments, the silicon layer 306 forms a channel region in the device structure 300 that may be intrinsic or it may be doped with either n-type or p-type dopants.",
                        "Similarly, the intrinsic silicon layer may be an individual layer formed separately with respect to the first and second TMSi layers, as shown in FIG. 4. Specifically, FIG. 4 is a perspective view depicting an exemplary device structure 400 for a transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide (e.g., TMSi/Si/TMSi) Josephson junction, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. The device structure 400 includes a substrate or gate back 402, which may comprise doped silicon, an insulating layer 404, which, in one or more embodiments, comprises an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, tantalum oxide, etc.) or other dielectric materials, disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the substrate or gate back, an intrinsic silicon or other semiconductor layer 406 disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the insulating layer, and a first TMSi layer 408 and a second TMSi layer 410 disposed on respective portions of an upper surface of the intrinsic silicon layer.",
                        "The first and second TMSi layers 408, 410 are spaced laterally from one another by a trench or other opening 412 through which a portion of the underlying intrinsic silicon layer 406 is exposed. In some embodiments, the opening 412 may be filled with an insulating material. In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the silicon layer 406 forms a channel in the device structure 400. This silicon channel may be intrinsic or it may be doped with either n-type or p-type dopants. In this illustrative embodiment, the TMSi layers 408 and 410 are formed above the intrinsic silicon layer 406 (i.e., in a different plane), and the transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide Josephson junction is therefore configured having a horizontal interface.",
                        "Thus, each of the exemplary device structures 300 and 400 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, a heterojunction is disposed on at least a portion of the upper surface of an insulating layer (304, 404), the heterojunction comprising a weak link layer of intrinsic or doped silicon (306, 406) and at least two TMSi regions (308/310, 408/410) coupled with the link layer. In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the TMSi regions (308, 310) are disposed on laterally opposing ends of the silicon link layer (306), so that the heterojunction has a vertical interface between the link layer and the TMSi regions. By contrast, in the embodiment of FIG. 4, the TMSi regions (408, 410) are disposed on respective portions of the upper surface of the silicon link layer (406) and spaced laterally from one another, so that the heterojunction has a horizontal interface between the link layer and the TMSi regions.",
                        "In the illustrative embodiments shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the link layer 306 and 406, respectively, comprises intrinsic or doped silicon. However, it is to be appreciated that in one or more alternative embodiments, the link layer forming a part of the heterojunction may comprise a normal metal (e.g., in a superconductor-normal conductor-superconductor (SNS) junction) or a geometric constriction (e.g., in a superconductor-geometric constriction-superconductor (ScS) junction).",
                        "FIG. 5 is a perspective view depicting an exemplary device structure 500 for a transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide Josephson junction with a top gate, according to another embodiment of the invention. This device structure 500, like the exemplary device structures 300 and 400 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, can be employed as a silicide-based qubit device in a quantum computing application. Referring to FIG. 5, the structure 500 includes a substrate 502, preferably a silicon substrate doped with either n-type or p-type dopants, an insulating layer 504, which in one or more embodiments comprises an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, or various other possible oxides), disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the substrate 502, and a heterojunction fabricated in accordance with aspects of the present invention, including a silicon (Si) channel 506, which can either doped or intrinsic, residing laterally between a first TMSi layer 508 and a second TMSi layer 510, the heterojunction being disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the insulating layer 504. The silicon channel 506 may be intrinsic or lightly doped with either n-type or p-type dopants. In the device structure 500, the TMSi layers 508, 510 are formed in the same plane as the silicon channel 506, and therefore the transition metal silicide/semiconductor/transition metal silicide Josephson junction is configured having a vertical interface.",
                        "The TMSi layers 508, 510, like the TMSi layers 408, 410 and 308, 310 forming the exemplary device structures 400 and 300 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, respectively, may comprise a superconductor formed as a thin film. The superconducting TMSi thin film may have certain desired thicknesses (e.g., about 10-100 nm) suitable for use in the fabrication of a Josephson junction. In one or more embodiments, a thickness of the superconducting TMSi thin film used to form the TMSi layers 508, 510 is about 20 nm, for establishing a high-quality superconductor-silicon interface. It is to be appreciated, however, that embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific thicknesses of the TMSi layers. The superconducting TMSi thin film, in one or more embodiments, provides a lattice-matched, atomically smooth interface between superconducting TMSi layers (e.g., 508, 510) and the adjacent semiconductor material (e.g., silicon channel 506) used to faun the Josephson junction.",

In one or more embodiments, the gate dielectric layer 512 is formed directly on and is aligned with the underlying silicon channel 506, which can be achieved using the same photolithographic mask to form the gate dielectric layer 512 as is used to pattern the silicon channel 506. In this manner, the gate dielectric layer 512 will not extend laterally onto the upper surfaces of the TMSi layers 508, 510 forming part of the heterojunction. In one or more alternative embodiments, the gate dielectric layer 512 may extend onto the upper surfaces of the TMSi layers 508, 510.",
                        "A gate electrode 514, which may comprise metal or metal silicide material, is disposed on at least a portion of an upper surface of the gate dielectric layer 512. The gate electrode 514, in one or more embodiments, may be superconducting and may also comprise TMSi. In this instance, the TMSi material forming the gate electrode 514 may be the same as or different than that of the TMSi layers 508, 510 used to form the heterojunction. Like the gate dielectric layer 512, the dimensions of the gate electrode 514 in this illustrative embodiment are preferably aligned with the gate dielectric layer 512, so that the gate electrode 514, the gate dielectric layer 512 and the silicon channel are aligned and congruent with one another. As previously stated, in one or more alternative embodiments, the gate dielectric layer 512 and the silicon channel 506 may not be aligned with one another.",
                        "The device structure 500 is essentially a tunable quantum qubit device that integrates a Josephson tunneling junction comprising a pair of transition metal silicide superconductors (TMSi layers 508, 510) separated by an active region (silicon channel 506) having a charge density that is controllable as a function of a bias signal applied to the gate electrode 514. The gate electrode 514 forms a capacitively-coupled control gate that is connected to the Josephson tunneling junction and is configured to modulate an energy level of the tunneling junction, which in turn controls a Josephson current flowing in the device.",

Tunability is achieved by simultaneously modulating energy levels of the Josephson tunneling junctions with the capacitive-coupled control gates and dynamically reconfiguring the quantum computing circuit via the independent control gates. This design allows for nonvolatile, field-programmable configurations where quantum states are created and reconfigured through gate-control coupling, providing increased performance, complexity, resiliency and reduced leakage.",

The depositions can be epitaxial processes, and the deposited material can be crystalline. In one or more embodiments, formation of a layer can be achieved using a single deposition process or multiple deposition processes, where, for example, a conformal layer is formed by a first process (e.g., ALD, PE-ALD, etc.) and a fill is formed by a second process (e.g., CVD, electrodeposition, PVD, etc.); the multiple deposition processes can be the same or different.",
