    "abstract": "We present a new method for thin-film synthesis of the superconducting A15 phase of vanadium silicide with critical temperature higher than 13 K. Interdiffusion between a metallic vanadium film and the underlying silicon device layer in a silicon-on-insulator substrate, at temperatures between 650 and 750 \u00b0C, favors formation of the vanadium-rich A15 phase by limiting the supply of available silicon for the reaction. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction verify the stoichiometry and structure of the synthesized thin films. We measure superconducting critical currents of more than 106 amperes per square centimeter at low temperature in micron-scale bars fabricated from the material, and an upper critical magnetic field of 20 T, from which we deduce a superconducting coherence length of 4 nm, consistent with previously reported bulk values. The relatively high critical temperature of A15 vanadium silicide is an appealing property for use in silicon-compatible quantum devices and circuits.",

                "In the early 1950s, the cubic A15 phase (A3B) was discovered to be superconducting, with the notable example of A15 vanadium silicide (V3Si) briefly having the highest known critical temperature (Tc) of any material (17.1\u00a0K)1,2. Other A15 superconductors were soon found to have higher Tc [e.g., Nb3Sn (18\u00a0K)3, Nb3Ge (23\u00a0K)4], and the later discovery of cuprate perovskites5,6 heralded an era of intense study of so-called high-Tc superconductivity\u2014leaving the material V3Si largely unexplored. As a silicide, V3Si is also appealing for its compatibility with silicon technology. In microelectronic devices, transition metal silicides are thoroughly studied and used for low-resistance metallic contacts to field-effect transistors7\u201310. V3Si is an s-wave, type-II superconductor with isotropic energy gap, suitable for superconducting devices such as Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)11,12. Furthermore, geometrical lattice matching analysis shows that V3Si forms a high-quality, epitaxial interface with Si with very small lattice mismatch (0.4%) and common cell area (40 \u00c52)13.",
                "In this work, we report a new method for synthesis of phase pure, superconducting V3Si thin films on silicon dioxide/silicon substrates (SiO2/Si)\u2014a process amenable to fabrication of superconductor-on-insulator devices leveraging silicon technology, and potentially compatible with silicon CMOS fabrication. In the bulk, V3Si is typically synthesized by melting together a stoichiometric mixture (3:1) of elemental vanadium (V) and Si in an inert atmosphere14. Thin films have been previously prepared by vapor phase deposition, including electron-beam co-evaporation of V and Si15, magnetron sputtering from a stoichiometric target16, and molecular beam epitaxy17. In silicon microelectronics, transition metal silicides are formed by silicidation\u2014the process of annealing metal films deposited on silicon8. However, silicidation of V deposited on Si typically forms the Si-rich vanadium silicide phase (VSi2), which is not superconducting, due to the excess supply of available Si during the reaction18,19. Silicidation of V deposited on thermally-grown SiO2 can form the A15 phase V3Si under the right conditions18,19, presumably because diffusion of Si out of SiO2 is slow enough to permit formation of the V-rich phase. However, this process also results in oxygen from the SiO2 reacting with V to form vanadium oxides that are mixed with V3Si in the final structure."

                        "Here, we synthesize phase-pure, vanadium-rich V3Si thin films by silicidation, by reacting only the thin Si device layer of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer (Fig.\u00a01). By optimizing the silicidation anneal conditions, we completely convert the Si device layer into V3Si without reacting with the underlying SiO2, leaving a sharp and smooth V3Si/SiO2 interface. In our experiments, we start with SOI wafers having a 20-nm Si (100)-oriented device layer on top of a 140\u00a0nm thick thermal SiO2. Stoichiometric conversion of the entire 20\u00a0nm thick Si layer to V3Si by silicidation requires the number of V atoms supplied by a 42\u00a0nm thick film (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Most typically, we deposit 90\u00a0nm of V\u2014which provides an oversupply of V to ensure complete silicidation of the Si device layer. Prior to annealing, we observe a sharp V/Si interface from cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig.\u00a02a). The samples are annealed in high vacuum (10\u22127\u00a0Torr) for 15\u00a0min, at temperatures (T) ranging from 650\u00a0\u00b0C to 900\u00a0\u00b0C. The V/Si interface disappears after annealing at sufficiently high temperature (Fig.\u00a02b), due to V-Si interdiffusion. Silicidation at T\u2009=\u2009800\u00a0\u00b0C or lower maintains a sharp, smooth interface at the underlying SiO2 layer, while higher T roughens this interface, indicating a reaction with the SiO2 (Fig.\u00a02c).Figure 1Thin-film synthesis of A15 vanadium silicide on insulator.

                        "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals more details of the silicidation process. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) cross-sectional images of a sample annealed at 700\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a02d\u2013f) show two distinct regions within the V-Si layer: an upper, porous region and an underlying, denser layer (Fig.\u00a02d). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) shows that the top layer is pure V and the bottom layer contains both V and Si (Fig.\u00a02e\u2013g), consistent with our supplying excess V for the silicidation reaction. The porosity of the V layer is a result of deposition by thermal evaporation, as deposited V atoms quickly lose kinetic energy on the cold substrate and have insufficient mobility to form close-packed films. Quantitative analysis of the EDX maps shows that the bottom layer contains V and Si in a 3:1 ratio (Fig.\u00a02h). X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms formation of the A15 phase of V3Si for samples annealed at 700\u00a0\u00b0C, along with impurities of VSi2 and V5Si3 (Fig.\u00a03). Annealing at 600\u00a0\u00b0C shifts the broad V (110) peak at 42\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, which is matched to V5Si3 (102) but is very broad and likely reflects an intermediate amorphous phase formed during interdiffusion. The presence of VO (200) peak in all samples suggests partial oxidation of the deposited V due to air exposure. For any sample annealed at less than 800\u00a0\u00b0C, we do not expect reaction between vanadium and SiO2, which is evident from the sharp interface between the V/Si layer and the SiO2 layer (Fig.\u00a02b). According to the EDX maps, the V3Si layer is about 50\u00a0nm in thickness, which matches closely the thickness expected from stoichiometric conversion of Si (52\u00a0nm, see \u201cMethods\u201d section). The dense V3Si layer suggests that V is the predominant diffusion species, i.e., that silicidation occurs primarily by V diffusing into the Si lattice. Significant Si diffusion would result in the silicide inheriting the porous appearance of the deposited V layer. Our observation is consistent with those of previous studies, which noted an \u2018ordered Cu3Au rule\u201920, suggesting that majority atoms are the most mobile ones\u00a0in the class of A3B compounds21.Figure 3X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) of V films deposited on SOI, before annealing, and after vacuum annealing at 600\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The pattern after annealing at 700\u00a0\u00b0C shows the formation of the A15 V3Si phase. The 600\u00a0\u00b0C pattern shows a transition from metallic V to vanadium silicide. Due to exposure to air during sample handling, vanadium oxide (VO) is also formed and evident in the diffraction patterns.",
                        "Profiling the vanadium silicide film by sequential argon ion milling and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verifies its composition (Fig.\u00a04). The film top surface is composed of excess V that has been oxidized upon air exposure, with the V 2p3/2 peak positioned at 515.6\u00a0eV, corresponding to a V3+ oxidative state (Fig.\u00a03a, black color). Beginning with spectra taken from 12\u00a0nm below the top surface, this peak shifts to 513\u00a0eV, which corresponds to elemental V (Fig.\u00a04a, red color). The emergence of the Si 2p peak at 99.0\u00a0eV (Fig.\u00a04b, green color) at a depth of 70\u00a0nm and beyond indicates the conversion to V3Si. In this region, the Si 2p peak position is very close to elemental Si (99.4\u00a0eV), while the V 2p3/2 peak remains at 513\u00a0eV, consistent with the metallic nature of V in A15 V3Si22. By analyzing the peak areas and sensitivity factors associated with V 2p3/2 and Si 2p elements in the V3Si region, at a depth of 77\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a04, blue color), the relative elemental ratio between V and Si is obtained at 3:1, consistent with EDX measurements (Fig.\u00a02h). The O 1s peak at 531\u00a0eV across all depths indicates the presence of vanadium oxide (VO) in both metallic V and vanadium silicide region due to exposure to air.Figure 4Depth-profiled X-ray photoelectron spectra of a V3Si thin film, probed from the film top surface (upper curve) toward the bottom (lower curve). (a) the V 2p and O 1s levels, and (b) the Si 2p level. Depth-profiling is carried out by Ar ion milling. The depth values are calculated by assuming a uniform ion mill rate.

                        "Four-probe resistance measurements of V3Si films versus T reveal their metallic nature and the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). We measure the film in-plane resistance using a constant-current bias of 50 \u00b5A and vary T at a rate of\u2009~\u20091\u00a0K\u00a0min\u22121 with no magnetic field. The sheet resistance of a 50\u00a0nm thick V3Si film silicided at 700\u00a0\u00b0C decreases from 2.8 to 1.0 \u2126/sq upon cooling from room T to 20\u00a0K, a resistance ratio of 2.8 (Fig.\u00a05a, inset). These values reflect the parallel normal state resistance of both the V3Si and the overlaying metallic V layer (also about 50\u00a0nm thick). At Tc\u2009=\u200913.75\u00a0K, the film resistance abruptly decreases to zero with a transition width of 0.3\u00a0K, marking the onset of superconductivity. Films silicided at T between 650 and 750\u00a0\u00b0C all showed superconducting transitions, with Tc decreasing with decreasing silicidation T (Fig.\u00a05a). We do not observe a superconducting phase transition in films silicided at T\u2009\u2264\u2009600\u00a0\u00b0C measured to temperatures as low as 4\u00a0K (Fig.\u00a05a, inset). The critical current density is determined from voltage-current measurements of strips fabricated from V3Si thin film annealed at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The strips are 30\u00a0\u00b5m in width and are patterned using photolithography, with etching performed in an argon ion mill (2.5\u00a0mA/cm2 beam density), and electrical contacts deposited by e-beam evaporation of 10\u00a0nm titanium and 300\u00a0nm gold. The voltage-current behavior of strips patterned from a V3Si film change from linear behavior above Tc to non-linear near the superconducting transition (Fig.\u00a05b, inset). Films display sharp, fully developed, critical currents at T\u2009<\u2009Tc, which increase as T is further reduced. At T\u2009=\u20095\u00a0K, the critical current density (jc) is 8.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 A cm\u22122, slightly higher than previous reports taken on V3Si single crystals23. This is likely due to the presence of impurity phases acting as flux-pinning centers, which lead to the observed higher critical current densities. Because the Tc of metallic V is 5.4\u00a0K for single crystals24, and lower for amorphous films deposited from the vapor phase25, the only contributions from the 50-nm-thick amorphous V film to jc that we would expect within the range of measured temperatures (5\u201315\u00a0K) is a proximity effect induced superconducting layer near the V3Si that serves to increase the effective thickness that carries supercurrent, which is taken into account in the main panel of Fig.\u00a05b.Figure 5(a) Electrical resistance versus temperature with no magnetic field, for vanadium silicide films annealed at 650\u00a0\u00b0C (red), 700\u00a0\u00b0C (blue), and 750\u00a0\u00b0C (magenta), normalized against normal state resistance at 20\u00a0K (inset).

No superconductivity is observed in the 600\u00a0\u00b0C sample, consistent with the absence of a V3Si phase.

                        "The A15 phase of vanadium silicide is a known type II superconductor that undergoes phase transitions at two different applied magnetic fields. At a lower critical magnetic field (Hc1) the superconducting order parameter is locally suppressed and the material supports magnetic vortices, and at an upper critical field (Hc2) the material reverts to the normal state. We measured the V3Si film resistance versus T in a series of increasing applied magnetic fields (H) in order to determine Hc2(0), the upper critical field at 0\u00a0K. The Tc of a V3Si film silicided at 700\u00a0\u00b0C and having Tc(0)\u2009~\u200913\u00a0K is continuously suppressed with increasing magnetic field (Fig.\u00a06). For each H, we determine the corresponding Tc(H) using the criteria R/RN\u2009=\u20090.5 (midpoint Tc), where RN is the normal state resistance. In the color map shown in Fig.\u00a05, the dependence of Hc2 on T appears as a narrow white region separating normal and superconducting behaviors. Because the highest magnetic fields available in our experiment (9\u00a0T) are insufficient to completely suppress superconductivity in our films, we deduce Hc2(0) for the material indirectly using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, which gives:\\[H_{c2}(0) = - \\frac{\\pi^{2}T_{c}(0)}{8e^{\\gamma}}\\left( \\frac{dH_{c2}}{\\mathit{dT}} \\right|_{T = T_{c}{(0)}},\\] where \\(\\gamma \\approx 0.5772\\)  is Euler\u2019s constant26. A linear fit to the Hc2 \u2013 T relation in the range of 0\u00a0T\u2009<\u2009\u03bc0Hc2\u2009\u2264\u20091\u00a0T provides both the tangent term in Eq.\u00a0(1) and zero field Tc(0), respectively, as the slope and the T-axis intercept (Fig.\u00a05). From this analysis, we obtain \u03bc0Hc2(0)\u2009=\u200920\u00a0T, which is consistent with the previously-reported bulk value of Hc2\u2009=\u200923.5\u00a0T for V3Si27. Knowing \\(H_{c2}(0)\\) , we can also calculate the superconducting coherence length \\(\\xi(0)\\)  in our V3Si to be 4\u00a0nm, using the relation \\({\\mu_{0}H}_{c2}(0) = \\Phi_{0}/2\\pi\\xi^{2}(0)\\) 28, where \\(\\Phi_{0} = h/2e\\)  is the magnetic flux quantum, also consistent with previous reports29.Figure 6Magnetic field dependence of superconducting critical temperature. The white region separating the normal state (red) and superconducting state (blue) are separated by a thin white region denoting the upper critical field, Hc2(T). A linear fit to Hc2(T) near zero applied field (dashed line) is used to calculate Hc2(0) using Eq.\u00a0(1)."
