                        "The generation of pluripotent stem cells that are genetically identical to an individual provides unique opportunities for basic research and for potential immunologically-compatible novel cell-based therapies (Byrne J A. (2008) Human Mol. Gen. 17:R37-41). Methods to reprogram primate somatic cells to a pluripotent state include somatic cell nuclear transfer (Stojkovic M, et al. (2005) Reprod Biomed Online 11:226-231; Byrne J A, et al. (2007) Nature 450:497-502), somatic cell fusion with pluripotent stem cells (Cowan C A, et al. (2005) Science 309:1369-1373) and direct reprogramming to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) (Takahashi K, et al. (2007) Cell 131:861-872; Park I H, et al. (2008) Nature 451:141-146; Yu J, et al. (2007) Science 318:1917-1920; Kim D, et al. (2009) Cell Stem Cell 4:472-476; Soldner F, et al. (2009) Cell. 136:964-977; Huangfu D, et al. (2008) Nature Biotechnology 26:1269-1275; Li W, et al. (2009) Cell Stem Cell 4:16-19). These methodologies, however, are characterized by a low reprogramming efficiency and a lack of knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms. While it has been demonstrated previously that more differentiated cells demonstrate a lower reprogramming efficiency (Gurdon J B and Byrne J A.(2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 100:8048-8052) and different somatic cell types possess differential reprogramming ability (Aoi T, et al.(2008) Science 321:699-702; Aasen T, et al. (2008) Nature Biotechnology 2008; 26(11):1276-1284) the art has not identified a subpopulation of cells within a somatic cell type possessing differential reprogramming potential.",
                        "Isolation of a subpopulation or subpopulations of cells within a somatic cell population possessing differential reprogramming potential would provide a method to significantly increase the efficiency of reprogramming, thereby enhancing the feasibility of the potential applications based on this technology (Byrne J A. (2008) Human Mol. Gen. 17:R37-41). Isolation of such subpopulations would also provide a tool for basic research studies to understand the underlying reprogramming mechanisms."

Also provided are methods for enriching for a population of human somatic cells that have enhanced potential to become induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (iPS cells), and methods for generating iPS cells from this population of cells, which may then be used for transplantation, for drug screening, for experimental models of cellular differentiation and interaction; for in vitro screening assays to define growth and differentiation factors, to characterize genes involved in cell development and regulation, and the like.

                                "The terms \u201cdifferentiated somatic cell\u201d or simply \u201csomatic cell\u201d encompasses any cell in or of an organism that cannot give rise to all types of cells in an organism. In other words, somatic cells are cells that have differentiated sufficiently that they will not naturally generate cells of all three germ layers of the body, i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. For example, somatic cells would include both neurons and neural progenitors, the latter of which may be able to naturally give rise to all or some cell types of the central nervous system but cannot give rise to cells of the mesoderm or endoderm lineages.",
                                "The terms \u201cprimary cells\u201d, \u201cprimary cell lines\u201d, and \u201cprimary cultures\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to cells and cells cultures that have been derived from a subject and allowed to grow in vitro for a limited number of passages, i.e. splittings, of the culture. For example primary cultures are cultures that may have been passaged 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 4 times, 5 times, 10 times, or 15 times, but not enough times go through the crisis stage. Typically, the primary cell lines of the present invention are maintained for fewer than 10 passages in vitro.",
                                "By \u201cpluripotency\u201d it is meant the ability of cells to differentiate into all types of cells in an organism. By \u201cpluripotent stem cells\u201d, it is meant cells that can a) self-renew and b) differentiate to produce all types of cells in an organism. The term \u201cinduced pluripotent stem cell\u201d encompasses pluripotent stem cells, that, like embryonic stem (ES) cells, can be cultured over a long period of time while maintaining the ability to differentiate into all types of cells in an organism, but that, unlike ES cells (which are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts), are derived from somatic cells, that is, cells that had a narrower, more defined potential and that in the absence of experimental manipulation could not give rise to all types of cells in the organism. iPS cells have an hESC-like morphology, growing as flat colonies with large nucleo-cytoplasmic ratios, defined borders and prominent nuclei. In addition, iPS cells express one or more key pluripotency markers known by one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to Alkaline Phosphatase, SSEA3, SSEA4, Sox2, Oct3/4, Nanog, TRA160, TRA181, TDGF 1, Dnmt3b, FoxD3, GDF3, Cyp26a1, TERT, and zfp42. In addition, the iPS cells are capable of forming teratomas. In addition, they are capable of forming or contributing to ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm tissues in a living organism.",
                                "By \u201chaving the potential to become iPS cells\u201d it is meant that somatic cells can be induced to become, i.e. can be reprogrammed to become, iPS cells. In other words, the somatic cell can be induced to redifferentiate so as to establish cells having the morphological characteristics, growth ability and pluripotency of pluripotent cells.",
                                "The term \u201cefficiency of reprogramming\u201d is used to refer to the ability of a primary cell culture to give rise to iPS cell colonies when contacted with reprogramming factors. By \u201cenhanced efficiency of reprogramming\u201d it is meant that the cells will demonstrate an enhanced ability to give rise to iPS cells when contacted with reprogramming factors relative to a control.",
                                "As used herein, \u201creprogramming factors\u201d refers to one or more, i.e. a cocktail, of biologically active factors that act on a cell to alter transcription, thereby reprogramming a cell to multipotency or to pluripotency. Reprogramming factors may be provided to the cells of the subject invention individually or as a single composition, that is, as a premixed composition, of reprogramming factors. The factors may be provided at the same molar ratio or at different molar ratios. The factors may be provided once or multiple times in the course of culturing the cells of the subject invention.

                                "A substantially pure composition of human somatic cells that have enhanced potential to become induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (iPSCs) is provided. As discussed above, the term \u201csomatic cell\u201d encompasses any cell in an organism that cannot give rise to all types of cells in an organism, i.e. it is not pluripotent. In other words, somatic cells are cells that have differentiated sufficiently that they will not naturally generate cells of all three germ layers of the body, i.e. ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Examples of somatic cells that may comprise the substantially pure composition of the present application are those from ectodermal (e.g., keratinocytes), mesodermal (e.g., fibroblast), endodermal (e.g., pancreatic cells), or neural crest lineages (e.g. melanocytes). The somatic cells may be, for example, dermal fibroblasts, keratinocytes, pancreatic beta cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, hepatocytes, hepatic stem cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, hematopoietic cells, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, pericytes, vascular endothelial cells, schwann cells, and the like. They may be cells that in the absence of experimental manipulation will not proliferate, or if they do, will only be able to give rise to more of their own kind, e.g. terminally differentiated cells; or they may differentiated to the point that they are capable of giving rise to cells of a specific lineage, e.g. adult non-pluripotent multipotent stem cells, e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, neural stem cells, cardiac stem cells, hepatic stem cells, and the like. In some embodiments, the cells will have a phenotype reflective of their differentiated state e.g. markers, cell morphology, and/or functional characteristics that reflect the differentiated state of the cells, as is well known in the art. As one non-limiting example, the somatic cell may be a cell of the fibroblast lineage. Cells in this lineage include differentiated fibroblasts, e.g. dermal fibroblasts, and less differentiated progenitor cells, e.g. circulating and tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells; cells from an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, etc. as is well known in the art. Dermal fibrobasts may express vimentin and/or fibroblast surface antigen (FSA), while less-differentiated fibroblasts may express CD34 and/or heat shock protein 47 (HSP47). In addition, fibroblasts have a general \u201cfibroblastic\u201d morphology, which, in general encompasses a branched cytoplasm surrounding an elliptical, speckled nucleus having one or two nucleoli.\u201d",
                                "In addition to being somatic cells, the cells that have enhanced potential to become induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (iPSCs) will express detectable levels of the pluripotency marker stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA3). In other words, the somatic cells are positive for SSEA3 expression, i.e. they are SSEA3+ cells. SSEA3, as first described by Shevinsky L H, et al (1982) Cell 3:697-705, is a carbohydrate cell surface antigen present on both cell surface glycolipids and glycopeptides. Antibodies to SSEA3 are commercially available, for example from Millipore, catalog number mab4303.",
                                "It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the stated expression levels reflect detectable amounts of the marker protein on the cell surface. A cell that is negative for staining (the level of binding of a marker specific reagent is not detectably different from an isotype matched control) may still express minor amounts of the marker. And while it is commonplace in the art to refer to cells as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d for a particular marker, actual expression levels are a quantitative trait. The number of molecules on the cell surface can vary by several logs, yet still be characterized as \u201cpositive\u201d.",
                                "The staining intensity of cells can be monitored by flow cytometry, where lasers detect the quantitative levels of fluorochrome (which is proportional to the amount of cell surface marker bound by specific reagents, e.g. antibodies). Flow cytometry, or FACS, can also be used to separate cell populations based on the intensity of binding to a specific reagent, as well as other parameters such as cell size and light scatter. Although the absolute level of staining may differ with a particular fluorochrome and reagent preparation, the data can be normalized to a control.",
                                "In order to normalize the distribution to a control, each cell is recorded as a data point having a particular intensity of staining. These data points may be displayed according to a log scale, where the unit of measure is arbitrary staining intensity. In one example, the brightest stained cells in a sample can be as much as 4 logs more intense than unstained cells. When displayed in this manner, it is clear that the cells falling in the highest log of staining intensity are bright, while those in the lowest intensity are negative. The \u201clow\u201d positively stained cells have a level of staining brighter than that of an isotype matched control, but is not as intense as the most brightly staining cells normally found in the population. An alternative control may utilize a substrate having a defined density of marker on its surface, for example a fabricated bead or cell line, which provides the positive control for intensity.",
                                "Also provided are methods for separation/enrichment of somatic cells that have enhanced potential to become iPS cells, i.e. SSEA3 somatic cells, referred to hereafter as \u201cthe subject SSEA3+cells\u201d The enriched cell population will be a substantially pure population, where by \u201csubstantially pure\u201d it is meant having at least about 70%, about 75%, or about 80% of the cells of the population be of the selected phenotype, more usually at least 85% or 90% of the population be of the selected phenotype, and sometimes at least 95% or more of the population be of the selected phenotype, e.g. 95%, 98%, and up to 100% of the population.",
                                "In methods of the invention, somatic cells that have enhanced potential to become iPS cells, i.e. SSEA3+ somatic cells, are separated from an initial population of somatic cells ex vivo or in vitro, i.e. outside the body of the individual, and sometimes in culture. This initial population of somatic cells, referred to hereafter as \u201cthe subject initial population\u201d is often a complex mixture or a heterogeneous culture of somatic cells. The subject initial population may be obtained from any mammalian species, e.g. human, primate, equine, bovine, porcine, canine, feline, etc. The subject initial population may include fresh or frozen cells, which may be from a neonate, a juvenile or an adult, and from tissues including skin, muscle, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, spleen, liver, pancreas, lung, intestine, stomach, and other differentiated tissues. The tissue may be obtained by biopsy or aphoresis from a live donor, or obtained from a dead or dying donor within about 48 hours of death, or freshly frozen tissue, tissue frozen within about 12 hours of death and maintained at below about \u221220\u00b0 C., usually at about liquid nitrogen temperature (\u2212190\u00b0 C.) indefinitely. For isolation of cells from tissue, an appropriate solution may be used for dispersion or suspension of the cells. Such solution will generally be a balanced salt solution, e.g. normal saline, PBS, Hank's balanced salt solution, etc., conveniently supplemented with fetal calf serum or other naturally occurring factors, in conjunction with an acceptable buffer at low concentration, generally from 5-25 mM. Convenient buffers include HEPES, phosphate buffers, lactate buffers, etc.",
                                "In some embodiments, the SSEA3+ somatic cells, i.e. the subject SSEA3+ cells, are separated from the subject initial population of somatic cells immediately following dispersion or suspension of the cells. In some embodiments, the subject initial population is cultured first to form a heterogeneous culture of cells, for example, a primary culture of fibroblasts, which is then subjected to separation techniques that will enrich for cells that express SSEA3. In some embodiments, the subject initial population is frozen and stored frozen, usually at about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about liquid nitrogen temperature (\u2212190\u00b0 C.), until a time at which the separation of the subject SSEA3+ cells from the subject initial population may be performed. In such cases, the cells are usually stored in 10% DMSO, 50% serum, 40% buffered medium, or some other such solution as is commonly used in the art to preserve cells at such temperatures, and will be thawed and recultured by methods commonly known in the art and as described further below.",
                                "Separation of the subject SSEA3+ cells from the subject initial population of somatic cells may be by any convenient separation technique. For example, the subject SSEA3+ cells may be separated from the subject initial population by affinity separation techniques. Techniques for affinity separation may include magnetic separation using magnetic beads coated with an affinity reagent, affinity chromatography, \u201cpanning\u201d with an affinity reagent attached to a solid matrix, e.g. plate, cytotoxic agents joined to an affinity reagent or used in conjunction with an affinity reagent, e.g. complement and cytotoxins, or other convenient technique. Techniques providing accurate separation include fluorescence activated cell sorters, which can have varying degrees of sophistication, such as multiple color channels, low angle and obtuse light scattering detecting channels, impedance channels, etc. The cells may be selected against dead cells by employing dyes associated with dead cells (e.g. propidium iodide). Any technique may be employed which is not unduly detrimental to the viability of the subject SSEA3+ cells.",
                                "To separate the subject SSEA3+ cells by affinity separation techniques, the subject initial population of somatic cells is contacted with an affinity reagent that specifically recognizes and selectively binds the marker associated with pluripotency, i.e. the SSEA3 marker. By \u201cselectively bind\u201d is meant that the molecule binds preferentially to the target of interest or binds with greater affinity to the target than to other molecules. For example, an antibody will bind to a molecule comprising an epitope for which it is specific and not to unrelated epitopes. In some embodiments, the affinity reagent may be an antibody, i.e. an antibody that is specific for SSEA3. In some embodiments, the affinity reagent may be a specific receptor or ligand for SSEA3, e.g. a peptide ligand and receptor; effector and receptor molecules, a T-cell receptor specific for SSEA3, and the like. In some embodiments, multiple affinity reagents specific for SSEA3 may be used. Antibodies and T cell receptors may be monoclonal or polyclonal, and may be produced by transgenic animals, immunized animals, immortalized human or animal B-cells, cells transfected with DNA vectors encoding the antibody or T cell receptor, etc. The details of the preparation of antibodies and their suitability for use as specific binding members are well-known to those skilled in the art. Of particular interest is the use of antibodies as affinity reagents. Conveniently, these antibodies are conjugated with a label for use in separation. Labels include magnetic beads, which allow for direct separation; biotin, which can be removed with avidin or streptavidin bound to a support; fluorochromes, which can be used with a fluorescence activated cell sorter; or the like, to allow for ease of separation of the particular cell type. Fluorochromes that find use include phycobiliproteins, e.g. phycoerythrin and allophycocyanins, fluorescein and Texas red. Frequently each antibody is labeled with a different fluorochrome, to permit independent sorting for each marker.",
                                "The subject initial population of somatic cells are contacted with the affinity reagent(s) and incubated for a period of time sufficient to bind the available cell surface antigens. The incubation will usually be at least about 5 minutes and usually less than about 60 minutes. It is desirable to have a sufficient concentration of antibodies in the reaction mixture, such that the efficiency of the separation is not limited by lack of antibody. The appropriate concentration is determined by titration, but will typically be a dilution of antibody into the volume of the cell suspension that is about 1:50 (i.e., 1 part antibody to 50 parts reaction volume), about 1:100, about 1:150, about 1:200, about 1:250, about 1:500, about 1:1000, about 1:2000, or about 1:5000. The medium in which the cells are suspended will be any medium that maintains the viability of the cells. A preferred medium is phosphate buffered saline containing from 0.1 to 0.5% BSA or 1-4% goat serum. Various media are commercially available and may be used according to the nature of the cells, including Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (dMEM), Hank's Basic Salt Solution (HBSS), Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (dPBS), RPMI, Iscove's medium, PBS with 5 mM EDTA, etc., frequently supplemented with fetal calf serum, BSA, HSA, goat serum etc.",

The SSEA3+ somatic cells will be about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85% about 90% or more of the cell composition, about 95% or more of the enriched cell composition, and will preferably be about 95% or more of the enriched cell composition. In other words, the composition will be a substantially pure composition of SSEA3+ somatic cells. The cells of the substantially pure composition will also express higher levels of the gene Nanog than the cells that express no or low levels of SSEA3 from which they were separated. Additionally, the cells of the substantially pure composition will be morphologically indistinguishable from the cells from which they were separated; for example, if enriched from a human dermal fibroblast population, SSEA3+ somatic cells will appear morphologically substantially the same as or identical to SSEA3\u2212 human dermal fibroblasts.",

Separation can be achieved with HPLC, reversed phase-HPLC, gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, dialysis, or other non-degradative techniques, which allow for separation by molecular weight, molecular volume, charge, combinations thereof, or the like. One or more of these techniques may be combined to enrich further for specific fractions.

Different packaging cell lines provide a different envelope protein to be incorporated into the capsid, this envelope protein determining the specificity of the viral particle for the cells. Envelope proteins are of at least three types, ecotropic, amphotropic and xenotropic. Retroviruses packaged with ecotropic envelope protein, e.g. MMLV, are capable of infecting most murine and rat cell types, and are generated by using ecotropic packaging cell lines such as BOSC23 (Pear et al.

This may include ubiquitously acting promoters, for example, the CMV-b-actin promoter, or inducible promoters, such as promoters that are active in particular cell populations or that respond to the presence of drugs such as tetracycline. By transcriptional activation, it is intended that transcription will be increased above basal levels in the target cell by at least about 10 fold, by at least about 100 fold, more usually by at least about 1000 fold. In addition, vectors used for providing reprogramming factors to the subject cells may include genes that must later be removed, e.g. using a recombinase system such as Cre/Lox, or the cells that express them destroyed, e.g. by including genes that allow selective toxicity such as herpesvirus TK, bcl-xs, etc",

For example, a permeant peptide may be derived from the third alpha helix of Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Antennapaedia, referred to as penetratin. As another example, the permeant peptide comprises the HIV-1 tat basic region amino acid sequence, which may include, for example, amino acids 49-57 of naturally-occurring tat protein. Other permeant domains include poly-arginine motifs, for example, the region of amino acids 34-56 of HIV-1 rev protein, nona-arginine, octa-arginine, and the like. (See, for example, Futaki et al.

Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5\u2032) to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of particular nucleic acid sequence to which they are operably linked. Such promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoters are promoters that initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e.g., the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Both a native reprogramming factor polypeptide promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct expression of a reprogramming factor polypeptide. However, heterologous promoters are preferred, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields. Transcription by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, which act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the transcription unit, within an intron, as well as within the coding sequence itself.",

Other methods of gene therapy are the introduction of drug resistance genes to enable normal progenitor cells to have an advantage and be subject to selective pressure, for example the multiple drug resistance gene (MDR), or anti-apoptosis genes, such as bcl-2. Various techniques known in the art may be used to introduce nucleic acids into the target cells, e.g. electroporation, calcium precipitated DNA, fusion, transfection, lipofection, infection and the like, as discussed above. The particular manner in which the DNA is introduced is not critical to the practice of the invention.",

The genome of the cells may be restricted and used with or without amplification. The polymerase chain reaction; gel electrophoresis; restriction analysis; Southern, Northern, and Western blots; sequencing; or the like, may all be employed. The cells may be grown under various conditions to ensure that the cells are capable of maturation to all of the myeloid lineages while maintaining the ability to express the introduced DNA. Various tests in vitro and in vivo may be employed to ensure that the pluripotent capability of the cells has been maintained.",

By \u201cenhanced efficiency of reprogramming\u201d it is meant that the cells will demonstrate an enhanced ability to give rise to iPS cells when contacted with reprogramming factors relative to a control. Cells and cell populations that demonstrate an enhanced efficiency of reprogramming have the ability to give rise to iPS cells that is about 150% of the ability of control cells or control cell populations, about 200%, about 300%, about 400%, about 600%, or about 800% of the ability control cells or control cell populations. In other words, the primary cells or primary cell cultures produce about 1.5-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 6-fold or about 8-fold the number of iPS colonies as control primary cells or a control primary cell population, or more. In some cases, the control cells/control cell population does not express a subject pluripotency marker. In some cases, the control population is a population that comprises some cells expressing the subject pluripotency marker, but is not enriched for those cells expressing the pluripotency marker, i.e. only about 2% or less, 5% or less, 7% or less, 10% or less, sometimes 15%, 20%, or 30% or less, occasionally 40%, 50%, 60% or 70% or less of the cells express the pluripotency marker. Typically, the methods of the invention provide for an increased efficiency of reprogramming that is at least about two-fold or higher than the efficiency of reprogramming of the control population.",

Examples of differentiated cells include any differentiated cells from ectodermal (e.g., neurons and fibroblasts), mesodermal (e.g., cardiomyocytes), or endodermal (e.g., pancreatic cells) lineages. The differentiated cells may be one or more: pancreatic beta cells, neural stem cells, neurons (e.g., dopaminergic neurons), oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, hepatocytes, hepatic stem cells, astrocytes, myocytes, hematopoietic cells, or cardiomyocytes.",

On day 2 a second transduction was performed at the same viral concentrations. On day 3 the mixed viral supernatant was again removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then cultured in fresh MEF medium. Five days post-transduction (day 5), the cells were resuspended with trypsin, counted and seeded onto 10-cm dishes pre-plated with irradiated MEF feeders. 105 transduced HUF1 cells were seeded per biological replicate. After overnight incubation, the MEF medium was replaced with hESC medium, and thereafter, the medium was changed either every day or every other day, as required. hESC-like colonies started to appear among background colonies around 14 days post-transduction. The colonies were manually picked and transferred to 12 or 6-well plates pre-plated with MEF feeders on day 21. Colonies that continued to expand and maintained their hESC-like morphology were further passaged; whereas, those that failed to expand and/or spontaneously differentiated were discarded.",

                                "We derived a fibroblast line from a skin biopsy from a healthy adult male (HUF1) (FIG. 1A) and used immunohistochemistry to characterize the expression of cell surface markers commonly associated with pluripotent stem cells (FIG. 1B, C and D). Unexpectedly, we observed that, even prior to reprogramming, the HUF1 cell population included cells that were heterogeneous for expression of stage specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA3; FIG. 1B). SSEA3 is a cell surface glycosphingolipid generally considered an embryonic/pluripotency marker (Kannagi R, et al. (1983) Embo J. 2:2355-2361; Enver T, et al. (2005) Human Molecular Genetics 14:3129-3140). Overlaying phase contrast and SSEA3 immunofluorescence images revealed that the SSEA3 expression was detected across the entire cell surface (FIG. 1E) and using confocal microscopy we observed that the SSEA3 expression was primarily localized to the cellular membrane (FIG. 1F). Additional small and localized regions of SSEA3 fluorescence were also detected around the peri-nuclear region, possibly reflecting the intracellular processing and packaging of SSEA3 on peri-nuclear endoplasmic reticulum and/or golgi bodies (FIG. 1F). Notably, in positive controls, strong cell surface expression of SSEA3 was observed in H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)(FIG. 1G) and no expression was observed in the negative controls (FIG. 1H).",
                                "We next examined whether the expression of SSEA3 in a subset of fibroblasts was specific to HUF1 or a more-general observation. Eight additional primary adult human fibroblast lines were derived from skin biopsies and immunostained. We observed that all eight lines contained a subpopulation of cells that were positive for SSEA3 (FIG. 2A). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of HUF1 cells stained with the SSEA3/488 antibody complex, revealed a larger subpopulation of cells with little or no SSEA3 expression and a smaller subpopulation with detectable SSEA3 expression (FIG. 2B). Subsequently, we isolated (through FACS) and cultured the top 10% and bottom 10% of the SSEA3/488 fluorescing cells as our SSEA3-positive and negative populations respectively (FIG. 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis of the two populations, following overnight adherence to exclude analysis of non-viable cells, revealed that >97% of the SSEA3-positive population expressed detectable SSEA3/488 fluorescence and 0% of the SSEA3-negative population expressed detectable SSEA3/488 fluorescence (FIG. 2C), demonstrating that the fluorescence activated cell sorting process can purify viable subpopulations of cells from a heterogeneous somatic population. These subpopulations were then used for reprogramming to iPS cells.",
                                "Previous reprogramming work demonstrated that we could reprogram the entire, unsorted population of HUF1 somatic cells using retroviral vectors that express OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC to generate iPS cells that express the same pluripotency markers as control H9 ESCs (FIG. 3A). Reprogrammed cells possessed a normal karyotype (FIG. 3B) and differentiated in vitro into beating cardiomyocytes, as well as, into representatives of all three germ layers in vivo (FIG. 3C).",
                                "We transduced our SSEA3-positive and SSEA3-negative populations with the same retroviral vectors, under identical experimental conditions, and seeded the transduced cells onto inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). After three weeks of culture under standard hESC conditions, plates were examined in a double-blind analysis by three independent hESC biologists for iPSC colony formation. Colonies with iPSC morphology were picked and expanded. We observed that all three biological replicates with the transduced SSEA3-negative cells formed many large background colonies (10-27 per replicate, FIG. 4A) but no iPSC colonies emerged; in contrast, all three biological replicates with the transduced SSEA3-positive cells resulted in the formation of iPSC colonies (4-5 per replicate, FIG. 4B) but very few large background colonies (0-1 per replicate, Table 1). Further characterization of the cell lines derived from the iPSC-like colonies revealed that they possessed hESC-like morphology, growing as flat colonies with large nucleo-cytoplasmic ratios, defined borders and prominent nucleoli (FIG. 4C).",
                                "When 5 lines were further expanded and characterized, all demonstrated expression of key pluripotency markers expressed by hESCs, which included: alkaline phosphatase, Nanog, SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA160 and TRA181 (FIG. 5A). The SSEA3-selected iPS cells also demonstrated a normal male karyotype (46, XY)(FIG. 5B), the ability to differentiate into functional beating cardiomyocytes, as well as, into representatives of all three germ layers in vivo (FIG. 5C). Most importantly, since we observed no iPSC colony formation or line derivation from the transduced SSEA3-negative cells, this suggests that these cells possess significantly lower or even no reprogramming potential relative to the SSEA3-expressing cells (Table 1). Additionally, a 10-fold enrichment of primary fibroblasts that strongly express SSEA3 resulted in a significantly greater efficiency (8-fold increase) of iPSC line derivation compared to the control derivation rate (p<0.05, Table 1).",
                                "We next examined the expression of genes that might potentially confer the enhanced reprogramming to the SSEA3-positive population, including Nanog (Silva J, et al. (2006) Nature 441:997-1001), Sa114 (Wong C C, et al. (2008) PLoS ONE 3:e1955) and hTert (Park I H, et al. (2008) Nature 451:141-146) as well as several control housing keeping genes (Gapdh, Rplpo and Ctnnb1). In addition to the SSEA3-positive and-negative populations of cells, which represented the top 10% and bottom 10% of SSEA3 expression cells respectively, we also included the intermediary SSEA3-expressing cells, which represented the remaining 80% of the total HUF1 cell population. Three biological replicates for each of the three subpopulations were analyzed. While no significant differences in gene expression were observed for Sall4, hTert or the housekeeping genes (FIG. 6 and table 2), the analysis revealed that expression of Nanog was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the SSEA3-positive cell population compared to either the SSEA3-intermediate or SSEA3-negative population (FIG. 6 and table 2)."

                                "In this study, we unexpectedly observed that SSEA3, a cell surface marker normally associated with pluripotent cells, is strongly expressed in a sub-population of cells derived from a primary human dermal fibroblast biopsy. The SSEA3-positive cells appeared indistinguishable, morphologically, from the SSEA3-negative fibroblasts (FIG. 2C). Expression of the SSEA3 antigen is not considered a marker of other multipotent stem cells, e.g. mesenchymal or epidermal adult stem cells (Deans R J and Moseley A B. (2000) Exp Hematol 28:875-884; Lavker R M and Sun T T. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 97:13473-13475).",
                                "Several recent studies have demonstrated that human iPS cells can be generated without permanent integration of genetic factors into the reprogrammed cell chromatin (Kim D, et al. (2009) Cell Stem Cell 4:472-476; Soldner F, et al. (2009) Cell 136:964-977; Kaji K, Norrby K, Paca A, et al. (2009) Nature 458:771-775; Woltjen K, et al. (2009) Nature 458:766-770; Yu J, et al. (2009) Science 324:797-801). While these integration-free human iPS cells hold great promise for future patient specific cell-based therapies (Byrne J A. (2008) Human Mol. Gen. 17:R37-41), the reprogramming efficiency is typically very low. Methods to enhance the reprogramming efficiency will significantly increase the feasibility of this approach, especially for cell types which are difficult to reprogram, such as the primary adult human fibroblasts used in this study. Our control iPSC derivation efficiency using the HUF1 line was very low, with only 1 iPSC line derived from 200,000 cells. However, in this study we have demonstrated that a 10-fold purification of the top SSEA3-expressing cells could increase the efficiency of reprogramming 8-fold relative to unsorted cells and to a much greater extent relative to the SSEA-negative cells. Indeed, in addition to identifying a cell population with enhanced reprogramming efficiency, we also identified an SSEA3-negative population with either significantly reduced reprogramming efficiency or no reprogramming ability. Comparison analysis between the SSEA3-positive and negative populations may help us elucidate the currently poorly understood mechanisms of reprogramming.",
                                "Our transcriptional analysis of the SSEA3-positive and -negative populations revealed a significantly increased expression of Nanog in the SSEA3-positive population (p<0.05). As increased Nanog expression has been demonstrated to enhance reprogramming efficiency (Silva J, et al. (2006) Nature 441:997-1001), this suggests Nanog may be playing a role in the differential reprogramming observed. However, it should be noted that the level of Nanog expression is thousands of times higher in hESCs and fully reprogrammed iPS cells than in the SSEA3-expressing HUF1 cells, making it likely that other factors may also be playing a role in the differential reprogramming observed. Future studies using global transcriptional and epigenetic profiling should assist in further identifying the differences between the SSEA3-positive and negative subpopulations, and may help elucidate the mechanisms of reprogramming."
