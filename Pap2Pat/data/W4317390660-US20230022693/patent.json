                        "Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are attractive for bioelectronics, wearable electronics, and artificial neuromorphic electronics because of their low driving voltage, low power consumption, high transconductance, and facile integration in mechanically flexible platforms. However, further OECT development faces several challenges, including poor electron-transporting (n-type) OECT performance versus their hole-transporting (p-type) counterparts. This unbalanced p-type and n-type OECT performance prevents efficient integration into complementary circuits, and the poor n-type OECT performance leads to inferior sensitivity to in vivo relevant analyte cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Cu2+ and Zn2+), severely hindering OECT biosensor development. The best performing conventional OECTs (cOECTs), having planar source/drain electrode architectures, require small channel lengths (L), along with a precisely-patterned semiconducting layer and electrode covering with passive materials, to yield high transconductance (gm) and fast switching (\u02dcms range) devices. This requires complex fabrication methodologies, including multi-step photolithographic and wet/dry etching steps. Furthermore, conventional photolithography can only reliably realize features/L of \u02dc1 \u03bcm, and while printing and laser cutting have simplified cOECT fabrication, it comes at the expense of performance. Moreover, to increase gm, OECTs based on thick semiconducting films are typically employed, inevitably compromising the switching speed since high gm values require efficient ion exchange between the electrolyte and the bulk semiconductor.",
                        "Previously reported, pioneering vertical organic transistor architectures required either a permeable/ultra-thin (e.g., single-layer graphene) electrode or very complex photolithographic processes to accurately register the nanoscopic electrode/semiconductor layers for effective gate field modulation.

One vertical OECT (vOECT) reported to date, based on p-type PEDOT:PSS, achieved ION,A and gm,A of 821 A/cm2 and 25.38 \u03bcS/\u03bcm2, respectively, but it required an ion-permeable silver (Ag) nanowire-based electrode to function. (Yan, Y. et al., 2020.) Ag is electrochemically unstable, thus cycling stability and enhancing gate leakage current, while using a depletion mode semiconductor (PEDOT:PSS) results in low Ion:Ioff."

                        "The redox-active semiconducting organic polymers are conjugated organic polymers having carrier-conducting backbones that are able to donate and/or accept electrons. The redox-active semiconducting organic polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers having side-chain substituents for enabling processability from solution. Depending upon the particular polymer, the backbone may be electron-conducting (n-type), hole-conducting (p-type), or may conduct both electrons and holes (ambipolar charge transport).

DPP copolymers include copolymers of DPP and thiophene, bithiophene, and/or dithienovinylene (TVT). The DPP polymers may have ethylene glycol side-chains or other hydrophobic or hydrophilic side-chains. Specific, non-limiting examples of such polymers include those shown on the right side of FIG. 1B and the ethylene glycol-functionalized p-type and n-type redox-active polymers shown in FIG. 1C. FIG. 1D shows the structures of a larger set of backbone units (\u03c0-units) for redox-active homopolymers and copolymers. The structures of some suitable comonomers, as well as the structures of various side-chains, are also shown in FIG. 1E.",
                        "The photocurable organic molecules are blended with the redox-active semiconducting organic polymers in order to render the resulting polymer blends photoprocessable. For the purposes of this disclosure, an organic molecule is photocurable if it is able to absorb radiation and undergo radiation-induced crosslinking reactions with other organic molecules to form covalent bonds. The reaction mechanisms by which the covalent crosslinks may be formed include cycloaddition reactions. The wavelengths of the radiation that induce photocuring will depend upon the particular photocurable organic molecules being used. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., wavelengths in the range from about 10 nm to about 400 nm) is generally suitable and, therefore, the photocurable organic molecules may be functionalized with ultraviolet wavelength-absorbing groups, such as cinnamate, dienecinnamate, cumarine, vinyl, allyl, acrylate, azide, and oxetane groups. For purposes of illustration, the structures of some functional groups that may be present as substituents on a photocurable organic molecule are shown in FIG. 1F, where R1 is H, F. CN, a C1-10 alkyl group, a C1-10 haloalkyl group, or a C1-10 alkoxy group, Me represents a methyl group, and a wavy line is used to show the attachment point to the organic molecule, consistent with the convention in the art. However, the photocuring reactions described herein are not limited to UV radiation-induced curing reaction; radiation from other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used. For example, the radiation that is typically used in the industrial FAB line of a semiconductor processing can be used to induce the crosslinking reactions, including I-line, H-line, G-line, and flood exposure.",
                        "The photocurable organic molecules can be monomers, dimers, higher order oligomers, and/or polymers that are functionalized with one or more of the radiation-absorbing substituents discussed above, or other radiation-absorbing constituents. In some examples of the polymer compositions, the photocurable organic molecules are carbohydrates that are functionalized with UV absorbing functional groups. However, other types of organic molecules, including polyesters, can also be used. By way of illustration, FIG. 1G shows the backbone structures of various photocurable organic molecules that can be used, where the wavy lines represent the locations of crosslinks. The use of carbohydrates and polyesters is advantageous because they are soluble in environmentally friendly solvents and, therefore, can be photopatterned using those environmentally friendly solvents. The photocurable carbohydrates include cinnamate-functionalized cellulose, glucose, and/or sucrose, examples of which are described in Wang, Zhi, et al. \u201cCinnamate-Functionalized Natural Carbohydrates as Photopatternable Gate Dielectrics for Organic Transistors.\u201d Chemistry of Materials 31.18 (2019); 7608-7617.",
                        "In order to prevent the photocurable organic molecules from interfering with device function, they are desirably redox-inactive, meaning that their oxidation states do not change upon interaction with the ions from an electrolyte during the operation of an OECT. Thus, the photocurable organic molecules may be dielectric polymers and are typically polymers that do not have a conjugated backbone.",
                        "The polymer compositions may take the form of a solution in which the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and, optionally, the photocurable organic molecules are mixed together in a solvent or solvent mixture in which both polymer components are soluble. The concentration of redox-active semiconducting polymer should be high enough to retain sufficient redox activity and charge carrier conduction for the intended application. By way of illustration, depending upon the particular redox-active semiconducting organic polymer being used and the requirements of the intended application, the solutions and the crosslinked organic films made from the solutions desirably have a concentration of redox-active semiconducting organic polymer of at least 10 weight percent (wt. %), based on the total weight of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecules (in the case of a solution) or the total weight of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the crosslinked organic polymer (in the case of a crosslinked organic film). This includes solutions and crosslinked organic polymer films having a redox-active semiconducting organic polymer concentration in the range from 10 wt. % to 90 wt. % and further includes solutions and crosslinked organic polymer films having a redox-active semiconducting organic polymer concentration in the range from 50 wt. % to 90 wt. %, based on the total weight of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecules (in the case of a solution) or the total weight of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the crosslinked organic polymer (in the case of a crosslinked organic film). However, concentrations outside of this range can be used for less demanding applications.",
                        "Solutions of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecules can be processed via various solution-phase processing techniques. For example, a coating formulation comprising a redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecules can be deposited on a substrate, such as an electrically conductive substrate (e.g., source, drain, or gate electrodes in a transistor), a dielectric substrate, or a solid electrolyte, via various solution-phase deposition methods known in the art. In various embodiments, the solution-phase process can be selected from spin-coating, slot coating, printing (e.g., inkjet printing, screen printing, pad printing, offset printing, gravure printing, flexographic printing, lithographic printing, mass-printing and the like), spray coating, electrospray coating, drop casting, dip coating, and blade coating. Spin-coating involves applying an excess amount of the coating solution onto the substrate, then rotating the substrate at high speed to spread the fluid by centrifugal force. The thickness of the resulting film prepared by this technique will be dependent on the spin-coating rate and the concentration of the solution, as well as the solvent used. Printing can be performed, for example, with a rotogravure printing press, a flexoprinting press, pad printing, screen printing or an ink jet printer. The thickness of the resulting film as processed by these printing methods will be dependent on the concentration of the solution, the choice of solvent, and the number of printing repetitions. Ambient conditions such as temperature, pressure, and humidity also can affect the resulting thickness of the film. Depending on the specific printing techniques used, printing quality can be affected by different parameters including, but not limited to, rheological properties of the formulations/compositions such as tension energy and viscosity. For non-contact printing techniques such as inkjet printing, the solubility requirement generally can be less stringent and a solubility range as low as about 1-4 mg/ml can suffice. For gravure printing, a higher solubility range may be necessary, often in the range of about 50-100 mg/mL. Other contact printing techniques such as screen-printing and flexo printing can require even higher solubility ranges, for example, about 100-1000 mg/ml.",
                        "For use in applications where structural stability is important, such as in the conducting channel of a vOECT, polymer blends in which the crosslinked organic polymer is at least partially phase separated from the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer can be used. In the phase-separated embodiments of the crosslinked organic films, the crosslinked organic polymer provides structures, such as pillars, within the film that enhance the mechanical robustness of the film.",
                        "Crosslinked, redox-active, ion-permeable semiconducting organic films can be made from solutions containing the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecules. Some such solutions consist of only redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and photocurable organic molecules dissolved in one or more solvents. Depending upon the particular polymers and molecules being used, the solution may be aqueous or non-aqueous. To make the organic films, the solution is first coated onto the surface of a substrate. The substrate may be a component of an electronic device or circuit, such that the redox-active, semiconducting organic films can be formed in situ as active layers in the device or circuit. The composition is then exposed to radiation that is absorbed by the photocurable organic molecules, inducing covalent crosslink formation to produce a crosslinked, redox-active, ion-permeable semiconducting organic film comprising, or consisting of, a blend of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the crosslinked polymer that is formed by the photocuring of the organic molecules. The films may be very thin, which is advantageous for thin film electronics applications such as vOECTs in which the channel length corresponds to the film thickness. By way of illustration, organic films having thicknesses of less than 200 nm, less than 100 nm, and less than 50 nm can be formed.",
                        "In addition to the photocurable organic molecules, the photopatternable compositions can include other components that can be used to selectively modify the processability of the composition (e.g., viscosity, photocuring speed, and/or absorption wavelengths) and/or the properties of the resulting material (e.g., dielectric properties, thermal stability, and/or decomposition temperature). For example, the composition can include initiators and/or additional crosslinking agents to enhance its photopatternability (e.g., by speeding up curing time or reducing curing temperature or radiation dosage) and/or to increase the crosslinking density of the present polymers. Examples of initiators can include radical initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), photoacid generators (PAGs) such as triphenylsulfonium triflate, radical photoinitiators such as diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (TPO), or photosensitizers such as benzophenone and 1-chloro-4-propoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one. Initiators of these types are currently sold under the tradenames Irgacure PAG 103, Irgacure PAG 121, CGI 1907, CGI 725, Irgacure PAG 203, and Irgacure PAG 290, the structures of which are shown in FIG. 11.",
                        "To illustrate, in certain embodiments, a crosslinked film can be deposited from a photopatternable composition, where the photopatternable composition includes (a) a redox-active semiconducting organic polymer, and (b) a photoacid generator dispersed in a liquid medium (e.g., an organic solvent or mixtures thereof). The redox-active semiconductor polymer can be present in the photopatternable composition at a concentration between, for example, about 1 wt. % and about 20 wt. %, and the photoacid generator can present in the photopatternable composition at a concentration between, for example, about 0.05 wt. % and about 1 wt. %.",
                        "Organic films patterned with fine features can be formed by selectively exposing one or more portions of the coating composition to radiation, while shielding one or more other portions of the coating composition from the radiation in order to selectively photocure the composition in the exposed portion(s). This can be accomplished using, for example, a photomask or a laser writer. As a result of the photocuring, the solubility of the crosslinked portions of the composition is reduced, relative to the solubility of the uncured portions of the coating. Therefore, by exposing the coating to an appropriate organic solvent, the unexposed portions of the coating composition can be selectively removed. The organic solvent used to form the initial coating composition can be used to selectively dissolve the unexposed portions. However, other organic solvents that selectively dissolve the unexposed portions can be used. Features with sub-micron dimensions can be patterned into the organic films in this manner. As a result, arrays comprising many devices, such as vOECTs, having very small footprints can be patterned quickly using a few simple steps.",
                        "One example of a vOECT is illustrated in FIG. 3A, which shows a cross-sectional view of the device. The vOECT includes a source 302 on device substrate 300, a drain 304, a crosslinked, redox-active, ion-permeable semiconducting organic film 306 sandwiched between source 302 and drain 304, an electrolyte 308 in contact with film 306, and a gate 310 immersed in electrolyte 308. Although source 302 and drain 304 in this embodiment are shown as the bottom and top electrodes, respectively, the top electrode could also be the source and the bottom electrode the drain. Alternatively, the gate electrode can be deposited on the same plane as the source or the drain electrode, forming a side-gate OECT architecture or on top of a solid-state electrolyte, as illustrated in the fabrication schemes of FIG. 3B or FIG. 3C, respectively. Furthermore, while the source and drain are gold contacts, and the gate is silver/silver chloride, other electrically conductive materials, including other metals, can be used. The source and drain can be formed using, for example, thermal evaporation and masking.",

The electrostatic repulsion caused by the application of this gate voltage induces ions from the electrolyte to diffuse into the ion-permeable semiconducting organic film 306 and change the oxidation state of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer. Depending upon whether the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer is n-type doped (n-channel) or p-type doped (p-channel), and the mode of operation of the transistor (depletion or accumulation), the charge carries may either decrease or increase the drain current.",
                        "Complementary circuits can be formed by incorporating a vOECT having a given channel type (n-channel or p-channel) with a second vOECT having a complementary (i.e., opposite) channel type (p-channel or n-channel) in a circuit. In the complementary circuits, one or both of the OECTs may be a vOECT. Examples of complementary circuits that can be fabricated include complementary logic circuits, such as NAND gates, complementary inverters, ring oscillators, and differential pairs. By way of illustration, vertically stacked complementary inverters (VSCIs) are circuits in which an n-type vOECT sits directly on top of p-type vOECT, or vice versa. Such 3D geometry enables much higher integration density as it requires a smaller footprint per inverter, relative to OECTs having a planar construction."

                                "This example demonstrates high-performance p- and n-type OECTs and complementary circuits by employing a vertical device architecture (vOECTs) easily fabricated by thermal evaporation/masking of impermeable and dense Au source/drain electrodes and spin-coating/photopatterning of the semiconductor channel. The vOECT fabrication process is illustrated in FIG. 1A and details can be found in Methods. The key to this process is the use of a redox-active [p-type (gDPP-g2T) or n-type (Homo-gDPP)] semiconductor blended with a redox-inert/photocurable polymer component [Cin-Cell] as the OECT channel (see structures in FIG. 1B, synthesis process in Methods). A vOECT geometry cross-section (FIG. 1H) and selected optical and SEM images (FIG. 1I) indicate that the channel length (L) is the semiconductor layer thickness (\u02dc100 nm), and the widths of the bottom and the top electrodes define the channel width (W) and the nominal depth (d) of the semiconductor, respectively. Conventional OECTs (cOECTs) were also fabricated as controls (FIG. 5). Briefly; i) Au source and drain electrodes were fabricated on a substrate using photolithography, Au thermal evaporation, and lift-off, ii) a solution of the redox-active semiconducting organic polymer and the photocurable organic molecule was spin-coated (e.g., gDPP-g2T:Cin-Cell) over the source and drain and the exposed surface of the substrate between the source and the drain and subsequently photocured via UV radiation; iii) a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was applied as the electrolyte over the cured film, and an Ag/AgCl gate electrode was immersed in the electrolyte.",
                                "Before device evaluation, the semiconductor film morphology and microstructure were characterized. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2B, pristine gDPP-g2T and HOMO-gDPP films were continuous and smooth (root-mean-square roughness, \u03c3RMS\u02dc1 nm) while both polymer blends with Cin-Cell were rougher after UV cross-linking/patterning (\u03c3RMS\u02dc3 nm) with evidence of phase separation, where Cin-Cell formed pillar-like structures which enhanced structural robustness and stability. Thus, Cin-Cell in the semiconducting matrix acted not only as a photopatterning component of the channel but, most importantly, an OECT structural stabilizer (vide infra). Two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS. FIGS. 2C-2E) patterns of the pure polymer and polymer:Cin-Cell mixture films were similar, corroborating phase separation and demonstrating that Cin-Cell addition does not significantly alter the overall film texturing and polymer chain order.",
                                "Next, vOECTs and cOECTs were tested and the performance parameters (Table 1) were extracted following standard procedures. (Ohayon, D. et al. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 13, 4253-4266 (2021): Moser, M. et al. Adv. Mater. 32, e2002748 (2020).) Control vOECTs without the Cin-Cell were also fabricated for comparison. However, the device yield was low and, most importantly, they were unstable after very few repeated gate voltage (VG) scans mainly due to delamination of the top electrode. Consequently, all the data reported here are for crosslinked polymer blends. The device transfer characteristics and the corresponding gm/subthreshold swing (SS) plots (FIGS. 6A-6D) demonstrate extraordinary performance for both the p-type and n-type vOECTs, achieving maximum drain currents (IONS) of 8.2\u00b10.5\u00d710\u22122 A (VD=\u22120.5 V, VG=\u22120.5 V) and 2.5\u00b10.1\u00d710\u22122 A (VD=+0.5 V, VG=+0.7 V) and gms of 384.1\u00b117.8 mS and 251.2\u00b17.6 mS, respectively (FIG. 6G). Note that despite the ultra-small L (\u02dc100 nm), the ION/IOFF of both devices is impressive (\u2265106). All p- and n-type vOECTs retained stable turn-on voltages (VON) of +0.10 and +0.21 V as well as subthreshold swing (SS) of \u02dc60 and \u02dc62 mV/decade, respectively, upon scanning VD from \u00b10.1 to +0.5 V. More relevant parameters for vertical architectures are the area-normalized gm (gm,A) and ION (ION,A). As shown in FIGS. 6E-6F, gm,A (ION,A) of 226.1 \u03bcS/\u03bcm2 (4036 A/cm2) and 112.4 \u03bcS/\u03bcm2 (1015 A/cm2) were achieved for p- and n-type vOECTs, respectively. These values are about 18\u00d7 (13\u00d7) and 100\u00d7(1000\u00d7) greater than those measured in the corresponding p- and n-type cOECTs, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the p-type vOECTs exhibited the highest gm,A and ION,A values reported to date, even surpassing those of heavily doped/depletion mode PEDOT:PSS OECTs, while the n-type vOECT performance surpassed all of the previously reported OECTs (including p-type OECTs) known to the inventors in terms of gm,A and ION/IOFF.",
                                "The vOECTs were fabricated using simple thermal evaporation of dense and thick (150 nm) Au electrodes through a shadow mask, in combination with a photo-patternable semiconductor layer, to create a structure with excellent ion intercalation. Using a semi-transparent Au top electrode (FIG. 3A), it was demonstrated that the electrochromic switch associated with the redox chemistry encompassed the entire semiconductor area between the top/bottom electrodes and was not confined to the two narrow regions of the semiconductor in direct contact with the electrolyte.",
                                "The vOECTs exhibited good transistor behavior even when operated at a VD of only \u00b10.001 V. Note, especially for n-type vOECTs, VON shifted from +0.43 to +0.21 V when VD was only increased from +0.001 to +0.1 V, due to the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), a short channel effect. For n-type cOECTs reported in the literature, and here specifically for the Homo-gDPP cOECT control, the energy mismatch between the n-type semiconductor LUMO level and the Au electrode work function resulted in a very high VON (>+0.4 V), and the limited electrochemical window of the aqueous electrolyte prevented the application of large VG biases. This is one of the key limitations of current n-type cOECTs and where DIBL plays a key role in the n-type vOECT performance enhancement seen here. Equally important, common issues of short channel transistors, such as loss of saturation, VT roll-off, and reduced current modulation, were absent in the vOECTs (FIGS. 6A-6G). This result is possible only if bulk redox processes occur so that the carrier concentration of the entire semiconducting layer is modulated. The low SS of \u02dc60 mV/decade measured for both vOECTs (FIGS. 6C, 6D) is another convincing proof of the extremely effective gating effect in this architecture. Furthermore, unlike cOECTs where the region with SS\u02dc60 mV/decade, if achieved, is narrow, the present vOECTs have a very wide subthreshold region [0.0\u02dc\u22120.2 V for gDPP-g2T and +0.3\u02dc+0.6 V for Homo-gDPP] with SS near or equaling the \u02dc60 mV/decade thermal limit. The wide subthreshold region is particularly useful for applications where high voltage gain and low power consumption are vital.",
                                "Cycling stability along with transient response of vOECTs were next assessed. As shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B, for both p- and n-type vOECTs, >50000 stable switching cycles were recorded. Aside from the ultra-stable performance, vOECT turn-on transient time (\u03c4ON) was <1 ms for both devices (FIGS. 7C, 7D), which is \u02dc6-9\u00d7 shorter than those of the corresponding cOECTs (\u03c4ON=6.75 ms and 9.73 ms for p-type and n-type cOECTs). To understand the mechanism of the faster vOECT switching process, electrolyte capacitors with the structure shown in FIG. 8 were fabricated, and the electrochromic process associated with the charging/discharging process dynamics was monitored. When VG was switched from 0 V to \u22120.7 V, the polymer film located in direct contact with the Au electrode oxidized immediately (within 100 ms in a 2\u00d70.5 mm2 area). This reflects the very high electric field (E) near Au increasing the ion drift velocity, s (s=\u03bciE, where \u03bci=ion mobility), thus effecting faster doping. Next, as the charging process continued, the entire electrolyte area covered semiconductor (\u02dc6\u00d72.5 mm2) oxidized slowly (\u02dc2 s), starting from the semiconductor near the Au electrode.",
                                "Similarly, the reduction also began from the semiconductor in direct contact with the Au electrode, followed by the portion near the edges. Therefore, since the entire vOECT channel layer was in direct contact with the Au electrode, the redox process was intrinsically fast. This mechanism is fundamentally different from that for lateral cOECT architectures, where even for ultra-small channel dimensions, the vast majority of the redox chemistry occurs in the semiconductor film located distant from the contacting electrodes, resulting in significantly slower switching. Thus, the present vOECTs exhibited the shortest is among known n-type OECTs and rival those of the fastest p-type OECTs to date, without extensive optimization of the vOECT electrolyte or electrode patterning.",
                                "The fabrication of vertically stacked complementary inverters (VSCIs) was possible due to the unique operation mechanism, simple fabrication process, and high stability of the present vOECTs. FIG. 4A shows a schematic of the VSCI, where the n-type vOECT sits directly on top of p-type vOECT. Such 3D geometry enables much higher integration density as it requires 50% less footprint per inverter (FIG. 4B). The voltage output characteristics indicate that the VSCI possessed a sharp voltage transition with a gain up to \u02dc150 (driving voltage=+0.7 V, FIG. 4C), and it was stable for >30000 switching cycles (FIG. 4D), further corroborating the excellent stability of both n-type and p-type vOECTs. Thus, a 5-stage ring oscillator (FIG. 4K) was fabricated based on the VSCI (FIGS. 9A-9B), and the output signal began to oscillate between 0.0 and +0.7 V at a frequency of 17.7 Hz (VDD=+0.7 V. FIG. 4E). This corresponds to a propagation delay of \u02dc5.6 ms for each inverter. Finally, NAND and NOR logic gates operating between 0.0 and +0.7 V (FIGS. 4F-4H, FIGS. 10A-10B) as well as a rectifier based on VSCI (0.35V amplitude, FIGS. 4I-4J and FIG. 10C) were fabricated demonstrating a library of circuit units. Note, previous cOECT-based ring oscillators, NANDs, and NORs were constructed with unipolar p-type cOECTs while complementary circuits were limited at the preliminary stage of an inverter due to the low performance of the n-type cOECTs. Thus, the vOECTs enable not only VSCI, far outperforming the corresponding state-of-the art cOECT inverters, but also facilitate integration of this electrochemical technology into more complex complementary electronics.",

The voltage sweeping speed was 0.1 V/s for the OECT measurements. For transistor and inverter cycling tests, the voltage pulse was generated by a Keysight waveform generator (33500B), while the current/voltage variation was monitored with an Agilent B1500A. During the cycling tests, to maintain a relatively stable PBS electrolyte concentration, a PDMS mold was placed on top of the device active area to confine the electrolyte displacement and slow water evaporation. For the inverter, to access accurate OECT transient behavior, a resistor was added between the source electrode and ground (see insets of FIGS. 7C, 7D), while an oscilloscope (Tektronix, T D S 2014) was utilized to measure the variation of the voltage on the resistor. A VD of \u00b10.5 V was applied to the vOECT, and a square pulse (from 0.0 to \u00b10.7 V) was applied on the gate electrode. Note, the resistance of the resistor should be small enough to ensure the highest voltage measured by the oscilloscope is not higher than 1/10 of the drain voltage. For the ring oscillator characterization, a constant VDD of +0.7 V was applied with an Agilent B1500A, and the VOUT was monitored by an oscilloscope (Tektronix, T D S 2014). For NAND and NOR characterization, square pulses (from 0.0 to \u00b10.7 V) with a frequency of 5 Hz and 10 Hz were applied as VIN-A and VIN-B, respectively, by a Keysight waveform generator (33500B), and the VOUT was monitored by an Agilent B1500A.

PEDOT-PSS is used as the semiconductor for fabricating planar OECTs which operate in depletion mode because, in its pristine state. PEDOT:PSS has a high carrier density and, thus, a high conductivity. This stands in contrast to the other semiconducting polymers in the previous examples, which have low carrier densities in their pristine state and, therefore, are suited for OECTs that operate in an accumulation mode. The depletion-mode vertical and planar OECTs based on PEDOT:PSS were fabricated using procedures described in Example 1. The vOECT exhibited excellent transistor behavior relative to the OECT having a conventional planar architecture and it could be efficiently turned off (FIGS. 15A-15C). Such a result would not be observed if only interfacial redox chemistry was occurring in the vOECTs. Therefore, this example demonstrates not only that bulk doping/de-doping occurred but that the OECT architectures are not limited to accumulation-mode semiconductors.",
