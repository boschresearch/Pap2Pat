    "abstract": "Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and OECT-based circuitry offer great potential in bioelectronics, wearable electronics and artificial neuromorphic electronics because of their exceptionally low driving voltages (<1 V), low power consumption (<1 \u00b5W), high transconductances (>10 mS) and biocompatibility 1\u20135 . However, the successful realization of critical complementary logic OECTs is currently limited by temporal and/or operational instability, slow redox processes and/or switching, incompatibility with high-density monolithic integration and inferior n-type OECT performance 6\u20138 . Here we demonstrate p- and n-type vertical OECTs with balanced and ultra-high performance by blending redox-active semiconducting polymers with a redox-inactive photocurable and/or photopatternable polymer to form an ion-permeable semiconducting channel, implemented in a simple, scalable vertical architecture that has a dense, impermeable top contact. Footprint current densities exceeding 1 kA cm \u22122 at less than \u00b10.7 V, transconductances of 0.2\u20130.4 S, short transient times of less than 1 ms and ultra-stable switching (>50,000 cycles) are achieved in, to our knowledge, the first vertically stacked complementary vertical OECT logic circuits. This architecture opens many possibilities for fundamental studies of organic semiconductor redox chemistry and physics in nanoscopically confined spaces, without macroscopic electrolyte contact, as well as wearable and implantable device applications.",

                "Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are attractive for bioelectronics, wearable electronics and neuromorphic electronics because of their low driving voltage, low power consumption, high transconductance and facile integration in mechanically flexible platforms1\u20133,5,9\u201311. However, further OECT advances face challenges. (1) Despite progress8, poor electron-transporting (n-type) OECT performance versus their hole-transporting (p-type) counterparts (approximately 1,000 times lower transconductance and/or current density)6,7,12, hinders the development of complementary logic and sensitivity to in vivo relevant analyte cations (for example, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+) for biosensor development. (2) Temporal and/or operational instability hinders all possible applications. (3) Unbalanced p-type and n-type OECT performance prevents integration into complementary circuits13,14. (4) Slow redox processes lead to sluggish switching. (5) State-of-the-art conventional OECTs (cOECTs), having planar source\u2013drain electrode architectures, require small channel lengths (L) of at most 10\u2009\u00b5m, along with precisely patterned semiconducting layers and electrode coatings with passive materials, for high transconductance (gm) and fast switching (approximately in the millisecond range)15, requiring complex fabrication methodologies15,16. Note that conventional photolithography can only reliably realize features or L larger than 1\u2009\u00b5m (ref. 16), and although printing and laser cutting offer simplified cOECT fabrication, this is at the expense of performance17\u201319. Moreover, to increase gm, OECTs typically use thick semiconducting films, inevitably compromising switching speeds because high gm values require efficient ion exchange between the electrolyte and the bulk semiconductor20. Consequently, without progress in materials design, particularly for n-type semiconductors, and the realization of new device architectures, OECT applications will remain limited in scope.",
                "In this report, we demonstrate high-performance p- and n-type OECTs and complementary circuits by using a vertical device architecture (vertical OECT, hereafter named vOECT) readily fabricated by thermal evaporation and masking of impermeable and dense Au source\u2013drain electrodes and spin-coating and photopatterning of an ion-conducting semiconductor channel. The vOECT fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 1a and details can be found in the Methods. The key to this process is the use of a redox-active p-type (gDPP-g2T) or n-type (Homo-gDPP) semiconducting polymer blended with a redox-inert and photocurable polymer component (cinnamate-cellulose polymer (Cin-Cell)) as the OECT channel (see the structures in Fig. 1b, the synthesis process in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). On the basis of the control experiments (vide infra) the optimal semiconducting polymer:Cin-Cell weight ratio was found to be 9:2. A vOECT geometry cross-section and selected optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1c,d) indicate that the channel length (L) is the semiconductor layer thickness (approximately 100\u2009nm), the widths of the bottom and the top electrodes define the channel width (W) and the nominal depth (d) of the semiconductor, respectively. cOECTs and vOECTs that use polymers without ion-conducting ethylene glycol side chains were also fabricated as controls; their performance is marginal (Extended Data Fig. 2).Fig. 1Fabrication scheme and vOECT materials used.a, Fabrication process for vOECTs: thermal evaporation of the bottom source electrode with a shadow mask (i), spin-coating and photopatterning of the semiconducting polymer\u2009+\u2009Cin-Cell blend (ii), thermal evaporation of the top drain electrode with a shadow mask (iii) and application of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) electrolyte and Ag/AgCl gate electrode (iv). b, Chemical structures of the redox-active semiconducting polymers (gDPP-g2T (p-type); Homo-gDPP (n-type)), and the redox-inactive cross-linkable polymer (Cin-Cell, cross-linking occurs through a photo-induced 2\u2009+\u20092 cycloaddition reaction). c, Cross-section illustration of p-type vOECTs, along with a false-coloured cross-section SEM image showing the phase-separated layer sandwiched between two dense Au electrodes. d, Optical image of a p-type vOECT, in which the electrode overlapping area is enlarged (W\u2009=\u2009L\u2009=\u200970\u2009\u03bcm). e, AFM height and phase images of gDPP-g2T:Cin-Cell blends. In all samples, the gDPP-g2T:Cin-Cell weight ratio is 9:2.",
                "Before evaluation of the device, the morphology and microstructure of the semiconducting polymer:Cin-Cell blend were characterized. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 3a,b, the pristine gDPP-g2T and HOMO-gDPP films are continuous and smooth (root-mean-square roughness, \u03c3r.m.s.\u2009\u2248\u20091\u2009nm), whereas both polymer blends with Cin-Cell are rougher after ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking/patterning (\u03c3r.m.s.\u2009\u2248\u20093\u2009nm) with evidence of phase separation in atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1e), in which the Cin-Cell forms pillar-like structures that should enhance the structural robustness and stability. Thus, the Cin-Cell in the semiconducting matrix acts not only as a photopatterning component of the channel, but, most importantly, as an OECT structural stabilizer (vide infra). The two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D\u2013GIWAXS, Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e) patterns of the pure polymer and polymer:Cin-Cell mixture films are similar, corroborating phase separation and demonstrating that Cin-Cell addition does not substantially alter the overall film texturing and the polymer chain order.",
                "Next, the vOECTs and cOECTs were tested and the performance parameters were extracted following standard procedures (Extended Data Table 1)7,21. Before discussing the results, note that control vOECTs based on semiconducting polymers without ethylene glycol side chains exhibit a negligible transistor response, demonstrating that the hydrophilic ion-complexing polymer facilitates ion penetration across the nanoscopic thin electrolyte-blend interface (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). Furthermore, the performance of control vOECTs with varying Cin-Cell weight contents indicate (Extended Data Fig. 2d\u2013g) that the device yield without Cin-Cell is low and, most importantly, that such devices are unstable after very few repeated gate voltage (VG) cycles, mainly reflecting top electrode delamination, whereas those that use a semiconducting polymer:Cin-Cell weight ratio of more than 9:2 exhibit poor performance (low current on (ION) and large hysteresis), because of reduced redox-active polymer content and constricted ion diffusion. Consequently, all of the data reported here are for cross-linked semiconducting polymer:Cin-Cell blends with a 9:2 weight ratio.",
                "The vOECT and cOECT transfer characteristics and the corresponding gm\u2013subthreshold swing (SS) plots (Fig. 2a\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 4) demonstrate extraordinary performances for both p- and n-type vOECTs, achieving maximum drain currents (ION) of (8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122\u2009A (drain voltage (VD)\u00a0=\u2009\u22120.5\u2009V, VG\u2009=\u2009\u22120.5\u2009V) and (2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122\u2009A (VD\u2009=\u2009+0.5\u2009V, VG\u2009=\u2009+0.7\u2009V), and gm values as high as 384.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8\u2009mS and 251.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6\u2009mS, respectively (Fig. 2e). Note that despite the ultra-small channel lengths (L\u2009\u2248\u2009100\u2009nm), the ION/current off (IOFF) ratios of both devices are impressive (\u2265106), exclusively due to the higher ION and low IOFF. All of the p- and n-type vOECTs retain stable turn-on voltages (VON) of +0.10 and +0.21\u2009V as well as SS values of approximately 60 and approximately 62\u2009mV per decade, respectively, upon scanning VD from \u00b10.1 to \u00b10.5\u2009V. More relevant parameters for vertical architectures are the area-normalized gm (gm,A) and ION (ION,A) metrics22. As shown in Fig. 2f,g, gm,A (ION,A) values as high as 226.1\u2009\u00b5S\u2009\u00b5m\u22122 (4,036\u2009A\u2009cm\u22122) and 112.4\u2009\u00b5S\u2009\u00b5m\u22122 (1,015\u2009A\u2009cm\u22122) are achieved for p- and n-type vOECTs, respectively. These values are about 18 times (13 times) and 100 times (1,000 times) greater than those measured in the corresponding p- and n-type cOECTs, respectively (Extended Data Table 1). Thus, the present p-type vOECTs exhibit, to our knowledge, the highest gm,A and ION,A values reported up until now, even surpassing those of heavily doped and/or depletion-mode poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) cOECTs. In addition, to our knowledge, the present n-type vOECT performance surpasses all previously reported OECTs (including p-type OECTs) in terms of gm,A and ION/IOFF(refs. 7,8,14,15,21,23\u201332). Importantly, the present vOECT structures also have reduced footprints because the contacting lines also function as source and drain contacts, eliminating the need for extra source\u2013drain pads overlapping with the channel materials that are required in cOECTs. This vertical architecture and blending strategy with the Cin-Cell is also applicable to other mixed ionic-electronic semiconductors, with the vOECTs based on two p-type (Pg2T-T and PIBET-AO) and two n-type (polyethylene glycol-N2200 (PEG-N2200) and BTI2) polymers exhibiting similarly enhanced transistor performance versus their planar counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 5).Fig. 2OECT performance and comparison with literature data.a\u2013d, Representative transfer characteristics (a,c) and corresponding gm and SS curves (b,d) of p-type gDPP-g2T (W\u2009=\u2009d\u2009=\u200930\u2009\u00b5m) (a,b) and n-type Homo-gDPP (W\u2009=\u2009d\u2009=\u200950\u2009\u00b5m) (c,d) vOECTs.

                "To our knowledge, there are no examples of truly vertical electrochemical devices in which transistor behaviour is observed throughout the entire semiconductor bulk by using ion-impermeable contacts. Previously reported pioneering organic transistor architectures with vertical source\u2013drain arrangements functioned as OECTs only when using permeable (for example, Ag nanowires) electrodes22,26,33, or when operated as electrical double-layer transistors or field-effect transistors. Therefore, bulk ion penetration and redox reactions are not involved, and only a small semiconductor volume under the top contact functions as the charge-carrying channel34\u201338. In contrast, the present approach uses simple thermal evaporation of dense and thick (150\u2009nm) Au electrodes through a shadow mask, in combination with a photopatternable semiconductor layer, to create a structure with excellent ion intercalation. By using a semi-transparent Au top electrode (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013c), Supplementary Video\u00a01 demonstrates that the electrochromic switch associated with the redox chemistry encompasses the entire semiconductor area between the top and bottom electrodes and is not confined to the two narrow regions of the semiconductor that are in direct contact with the electrolyte. Evidence for bulk doping is further supported by the following observations: (1) ION and gm of the vOECTs with different top electrode widths but identical bottom electrode widths, thus meaning an equal electrolyte\u2013semiconductor interfacial area but a different semiconductor area or mass available for doping or de-doping, increase linearly (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f), illustrating that doping is not limited to the semiconductor\u2013electrolyte interface. (2) Depletion-mode PEDOT:PSS vOECTs exhibit excellent switching behaviour and can be efficiently turned off (Extended Data Fig. 6g), which would be impossible if only interfacial redox chemistry was occurring in the vOECTs. (3) The measured saturation ION values of the present vOECTs would carry unreasonably large electrical current densities (>107\u2009A\u2009cm\u22122) if the channel were only few nanometres thick, as in typical electrical double-layer transistors. (4) Finally, devices based on very hydrophobic blends, which do not support ion intercalation across the nanoscopic interface, are non-functional (vide supra, Extended Data Fig. 2c).",
                "The present vOECTs also exhibit good transistor behaviour even when operated at a VD of only \u00b10.001\u2009V (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Note, especially for the n-type vOECTs, VON shifts from +0.43 to +0.21\u2009V when VD is only increased from +0.001 to +0.1\u2009V because of the drain-induced barrier lowering, which is a short channel effect22. For n-type cOECTs reported in the literature, and here specifically for Homo-gDPP cOECT control (Extended Data Fig. 4h), the energetic mismatch between the n-type semiconductor LUMO level and the Au electrode work function results in a very high VON (>+0.4\u2009V), and the limited electrochemical window of the aqueous electrolyte prevents the application of large VG biases. This is one of the key limitations of current n-type cOECTs39 and it is where drain-induced barrier lowering plays a key role in the n-type vOECT performance enhancement seen here. Common issues of short channel transistors, such as loss of saturation40, VT roll-off and reduced current modulation22, which\u00a0are equally as important, are absent in the vOECTs (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). This result is possible only if the redox processes modulate the carrier concentration of the entire semiconducting layer2,41. The low SS of approximately 60\u2009mV per\u2009decade measured for both vOECTs (Fig. 2b,d) provides more convincing proof of the extremely effective gating in the present vertical architecture. Furthermore, unlike cOECTs in which the region with SS approximately 60\u2009mV per\u2009decade, if achieved, is narrow (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h), the present vOECTs have a very wide subthreshold region (0.0\u2009\u2248\u2009\u22120.2\u2009V for gDPP-g2T and +0.3\u2009\u2248\u2009+0.6\u2009V for Homo-gDPP) with SS near or equalling the approximately 60\u2009mV per decade thermal limit. The wide subthreshold region is particularly useful for applications in which high voltage gain and low power consumption are vital42,43.",
                "The cycling stability along with the transient response of the OECTs were next assessed. As shown in Fig. 3a,b, for both p- and n-type vOECTs, more than 50,000 stable switching cycles are recorded, which is an order of magnitude higher than for literature values of OECTs, especially for n-type devices21,44. Note that the stability of the ubiquitous PEDOT:PSS in depletion-mode vOECTs is also greatly stabilized compared to that in cOECT architectures (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Furthermore, the vOECT turn-on transient time (\u03c4ON) is less than 0.5\u2009ms for both devices (Fig. 3c,d), and is comparable to those of the corresponding precisely patterned cOECTs (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h).Fig. 3vOECT stability, switching time and frequency-dependent transconductance (bandwidth) characteristics.a\u2013d, Cycling stability (cycling frequency of 10\u2009Hz) (a,b) and transient response (c,d) of p-type gDPP-g2T (a,c) and n-type Homo-gDPP (b,d) vOECTs, where VD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.1\u2009V, VG is switching between 0\u2009V and \u22120.5\u2009V for the p-type vOECT, and VD\u2009=\u2009+0.1\u2009V, VG is switching between 0\u2009V and +0.7\u2009V for the n-type vOECT.

The insets in g and h are the EIS measurement setup (g) and the equivalent circuit\u00a0(2R1C behavior) (h).Source data",
                "To validate the fast switching process and to understand the underlying mechanism, bandwidth and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for both cOECTs and vOECTs were carried out (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Figs. 7i and 8). Cut-off frequencies (fc) of approximately 500 and approximately 1,200\u2009Hz are measured for p- and n-type vOECTs, respectively, which are consistent with the transient responses in Fig. 3c, whereas the EIS based on the vertical configuration also exhibits typical 2R1C\u00a0behaviour as that in standard two-electrode configurations (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013c). Moreover, vOECTs with different semiconductor film thicknesses were also fabricated and the transient responses were accessed (Extended Data Fig. 8d). As the film thickness (that is, the vOECT channel length) increases from 100 to 400\u2009nm, \u03c4ON and \u03c4OFF increase from 425\u2009\u00b5s and 85\u2009\u00b5s (100\u2009nm) to 32.6\u2009ms and 966\u2009\u00b5s (400\u2009nm), respectively, showing that the confined electric field in the channel is the key for the fast transient response (Supplementary Video 2). On the basis of these results, it is fast bulk redox instead of interfacial doping near the semiconductor\u2013electrolyte interface that is established, in which the short channel length leads to a strong electric field in the channel that effectively enhances the ion drift velocity, thereby leading to fast doping. Consequently, even in vOECTs for which the ion diffusion length is greater than 15\u2009\u00b5m, the vOECT response times are amongst the shortest of the known n-type OECTs and are comparable to current state-of-the-art p-type OECTs, without extensive vOECT electrolyte or electrode patterning optimization7,8,14,15,21,23\u201329,45.",
                "So far, complementary logic has not been demonstrated for any type of vertical organic transistor architecture, mainly because of immaturity of the fabrication processes22. Here vertically stacked complementary inverters (VSCIs) are possible because of the unique vOECT operation mechanism, simple fabrication process and high stability of the present devices. Figure 4a shows a schematic of the VSCI, in which the n-type vOECT is located directly on top of the p-type vOECT. Such three-dimensional geometries enable much higher integration densities that require a 50% smaller footprint per inverter (Fig. 4b). The voltage output characteristics indicate that the VSCI possesses a sharp voltage transition with a gain of up to approximately 150 (driving voltage\u2009=\u2009+0.7\u2009V, Fig. 4c) and is stable for more than 30,000 switching cycles (Fig. 4d), further corroborating the excellent stability of both the n-type and p-type vOECTs. Thus, the present VSCI can also be used as an effective ion sensor over a wide concentration range (1\u2009\u00b5M to approximately 0.1\u2009M of KCl aqueous solution, Extended Data Fig. 8e,f), for which the transition voltage of the inverter can be effectively modulated to near half of voltage drain drain,\u00a0VDD/2.Fig. 4Vertically stacked complementary circuits based on vOECTs.a, Illustration of a VSCI based on vOECTs\u00a0(OSC = organic semiconductor). b, Top view of the VSCI, for which the Au electrode locations are indicated. c, Voltage output characteristics of the VSCI, along with the voltage gain. d, Switching stability of the VSCI with a switching frequency of 10\u2009Hz. e,f, Photograph of a five-stage ring oscillator (e) and the corresponding output characteristics (f). g\u2013i, Photograph of NAND (g) and NOR (h) circuits, and the corresponding voltage input/output characteristics (i). j, Photograph of a rectifier and the corresponding output characteristics (k). Note, in photographs g,h and i, the electrolyte and Ag/AgCl are omitted to provide a better view of the channel areas.Source data",
                "In addition, a five-stage ring oscillator was fabricated based on the present VSCI (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9), and the output signal begins to oscillate between 0.0 and +0.7\u2009V at a frequency of 17.7\u2009Hz (VDD\u2009=\u2009+0.7\u2009V, Fig. 4f). This corresponds to a propagation delay of approximately 5.6\u2009ms for each inverter. Finally, NAND and NOR logic gates operating between 0.0 and +0.7\u2009V (Fig. 4g\u2013i and Extended Data Fig. 9) as well as a VSCI-based rectifier (0.35\u2009V amplitude, Fig. 4j,k and Extended Data Fig. 9) were fabricated, demonstrating a versatile library of circuitry elements. Note that previous cOECT-based ring oscillators, NANDs and NORs were fabricated with unipolar p-type cOECTs17,46\u201348, whereas complementary circuits were limited at the preliminary stage of an inverter because of the low performance of the n-type cOECTs12,14. Thus, the present vOECTs enable not only VSCIs, which far outperform the corresponding state-of-the-art cOECT inverters17,49,50, but they also facilitate the integration of this electrochemical technology into more complex complementary electronics.",
                "In summary, this work reports vOECTs that demonstrate unprecedented performances for both p- and n-type operation modes. The device architecture demonstrated here is enabled by the synthesis of new electro-active and ion-permeable semiconducting polymers and by the interface engineering of electro-active blend layers. The devices are accessible by conventional fabrication processes and provide high fidelity and stable performance characteristics. They open up opportunities for fundamentally new system designs in diverse applications including low-cost diagnostics, brain-machine interfaces, implantable and wearable devices, prosthetics and intelligent soft robotics, for which small effective footprints along with high gm and low driving voltage metrics are essential requirements. Moreover, vOECTs offer a new design paradigm for flexible and stretchable complementary devices and related logic circuits."

Next, the p-type gDPP-g2T:Cin-Cell mixture solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 3,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009s and was cross-linked under UV light for 30\u2009s with a shadow mask. The film was patterned by immersing it in chloroform for 3\u2009s and blow-drying. Next, 150\u2009nm Au were thermally evaporated with a shadow mask as the middle electrode (VOUT). The n-type Homo-gDPP:Cin-Cell mixture was then spin-coated and photopatterned in the same way as for the p-type polymer blend. Then, 150\u2009nm Au top electrode (ground,\u00a0GND) was thermally evaporated with a shadow mask. Pure Cin-Cell solution was then spin-coated at 5,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009s, cross-linked under UV light for 60\u2009s with a shadow mask and developed in chloroform for 3\u2009s, to leave openings for the active channel areas and VOUT electrodes. A Ag/AgCl paste (Creative Materials, 125-20) was applied on the VOUT electrodes of each inverter and vacuum dried for 30\u2009min. Finally, a drop of PBS electrolyte (approximately 2\u2009\u00b5l) was applied on each VOUT electrode and its adjacent inverter active channel area."

For the planar or conventional architecture, the carrier mobility of the p-type cOECT is found to be 1.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121, which is comparable to other high-performance p-type OECTs.

However, for the vertical devices, the calculated carrier mobilities are much lower, (3.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 and (3.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61)\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 for the p-type and n-type vOECTs, respectively.",
                        "The much lower and similar carrier mobilities in the vOECTs probably originate from the large series resistance from the source\u2013drain electrodes and, to a lesser extent, the non-optimal polymer morphology of the spin-coated films, which typically enhances in-plane rather than out-of-plane organic semiconductor charge transport. Because the measured channel resistance in the vertical structure in the on-state is less than 10\u2009\u03a9, series resistances originating at the electrode\u2013semiconductor interface and within the electrode contact will reduce the measured drain current notably16. Overall, these observations indicate that further optimization of charge injection and connecting-line conductivity, and the use of organic semiconductors that favour vertical charge transport as in those for organic photovoltaics, will probably enhance the current densities even further. Nevertheless, to properly evaluate the true carrier mobilities for the unconventional vertical architecture reported here, additional modelling and simulation efforts are required. This would be of great interest to the entire community."
