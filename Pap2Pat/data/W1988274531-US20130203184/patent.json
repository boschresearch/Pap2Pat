                        "With the recent advent of rapidly aging society in advanced countries, senile dementia is posing medically and socially serious problems. Measures against dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as \u201cAD\u201d), particularly, establishment of an early diagnosis method, is urgently needed. Pathologically, AD is a disease confirmed to show senile plaque in the cerebral parenchyma mainly constituted with an aggregate of amyloid \u03b2 peptide (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as \u201cA\u03b2\u201d), vascular amyloid that appears due to A\u03b2 accumulation in the cerebral blood vessels, intracellular accumulation of neurofibril tangle in the brain and the like (non-patent documents 1 and 2). A\u03b2 is produced from an amyloid \u03b2 precursor protein (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as \u201cAPP\u201d) by sequential enzyme reactions of \u03b2 secretase (BACE1) (non-patent documents 3-6) and \u03b3 secretase (non-patent document 7). Since most of early-onset familial AD patients have a gene mutation influencing A\u03b2 production mechanism or aggregation, and neurite associated with A\u03b2 aggregation is often damaged (non-patent document 2), the process of A\u03b2 aggregation and accumulation in the brain is considered to be strongly related to the onset of AD.",
                        "While APP is suggested to have a receptor-like function and binds to various extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., heparin and collagen (non-patent documents 8 and 9) etc.), elucidation of the biological function of APP still remains to be an important scientific problem (non-patent document 10). In mammals, two kinds of APP paralogs are known and designated as APP-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2, respectively). Interestingly, a triple knockout mouse that lacks all of these three APP family members (i.e., APP, APLP1 and APLP2) dies soon after birth (non-patent document 11), which suggests redundant function of APP family proteins. Furthermore, APP contains three kinds of isoforms APP695, APP751 and APP770 due to selective splicing (non-patent documents 12 and 13). As compared to APP695, APP751 further contains a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) region, and APP770 contains an OX2 region in addition to KPI region. While APP695 is expressed in the highest amount in neuron, APP751 and APP770 show more universal expression patterns (non-patent document 14). Secretory APP containing the KPI region (also known as protease nexin 2) has a possibility of inhibiting a particular serine protease (particularly some of prothrombotic enzymes (non-patent document 15)). On the other hand, as for the function of the OX2 region, available information is extremely limited.",
                        "While many markers showing a correlation with AD have conventionally been reported, most of the markers are unclear as to the relationship with pathological changes, and diagnostic values have not been necessarily established. Examples of the marker directly related to the pathological changes include decrease of a kind of A\u03b2 consisting of 42 amino acids (A\u03b21-42), increase of (phosphorylated) tau protein and the like in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, A\u03b2 is known to show value changes only after aggravation of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and cannot be used as an early diagnostic marker. When phosphorylated tau is used as a biomarker, the nerve cell death has already progressed at the time the phosphorylated tau shows an increase, and complete recovery of neural function cannot be expected by starting the treatment at this stage. In addition, since these markers are mainly measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture fluid), sampling thereof requires a special technique, placing a great burden on patients, and cannot be a method for mass screening.",
                        "The symptoms of AD are reported to be closely related to A\u03b2 accumulation in the cerebral parenchyma and intracerebral vascular wall (non-patent documents 16-18). Particularly, accumulation of A\u03b2 in the cerebrovascular system is also considered to be the etiology of cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as \u201cCAA\u201d). CAA is found in more than 80% of AD patients, and 10-40% of the elderly without AD (non-patent document 19). For example, according to an elaborated analysis of pathological section of patients with Alzheimer's disease by using electron microscope, amyloid fiber, which is A\u03b2 aggregate, and the like are found in various intracerebral capillaries, which suggests that aggregation and accumulation of A\u03b2 in the cerebral blood vessels are strongly related to AD (non-patent document 20). In addition, CAA is known to also cause cerebrovascular dementia disorder, cerebral apoplexy and intracerebral bleeding. In AD treatment using a vaccine against A\u03b2, moreover, CAA is suggested to be a potential influence causing side effects (non-patent documents 21 and 22), and therefore, the necessity of CAA diagnosis showing the state of A\u03b2 accumulation in the cerebral blood vessels has widely been pointed out. While the important role of cerebrovascular smooth muscle cell in the removal of A\u03b2 in blood vessels has recently attracted much attention (non-patent document 23), no precedent detailed analysis of APP in vascular endothelial cell is available, and the production site of accumulative vascular A\u03b2 remains unrevealed."

The present inventors have considered that A\u03b2 production in the nerve cell and A\u03b2 production in the vascular endothelial cell can be identified by separating nerve cell-derived APP and vascular endothelial cell-derived APP, and conducted intensive studies and analyzed.",
                                "As a result, they have found for the first time in the world that unique splicing variant APP770 can be specifically detected in vascular endothelial cell, which is conventionally unnoted from the aspect of A\u03b2 production, and amyloid 1340 and 42 are produced from APP770 of vascular endothelial cell, and it leads to the finding that a cleavage product of APP770 can be used as an index of amyloid accumulation in the cerebral blood vessels.",

The present inventors have found that soluble APP770\u03b2 (sAPP770\u03b2), which is an N-terminal side fragment of BACE1 cleavage product of APP770, can be a biomarker of diseases accompanied by A\u03b2 accumulation, such as cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease, since A\u03b2 and C-terminal side fragment of APP after A\u03b2 production are common in each APP splicing variant, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.",

As aging proceeds, the A\u03b2 level in the body is considered to increase.

Thus, a disease accompanied by accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 peptide typically includes, irrespective of whether the symptom is exteriorized, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, cerebrovascular dementia, other dementia, cerebral infarction and the like. Since some reports indicate that A\u03b2 accumulation in cerebral blood vessels is observed in initial stages of Alzheimer's disease, soluble amyloid \u03b2 precursor protein 770\u03b2 may increase before highly toxic A\u03b2 oligomer increases."

In addition, when the target disease of the determination by the aforementioned sAPP770\u03b2 level and that by the sAPP695\u03b2 level are both Alzheimer's disease, the diagnosis can determine, in more detail, the state of Alzheimer's disease after the onset.",

E., et al., J. Neurosci., 25, 6213-6220 (2005), Racke, M. M., et al., J. Neurosci., 25, 629-636 (2005).).",

This is based on the finding that emboli are leaked to outside of blood vessel in a recanalization of brain microvessel (Nature. 2010 May 27; 465(7297):478-82.). From this finding, since A\u03b2 accumulation is also present as an embolus, it is possible that A\u03b2 is leaked to outside of blood vessel in a recanalization of brain microvessel, and said A\u03b2 consequently accumulate in the cerebral parenchymal region and affect the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.",

The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on the detection of sAPP695\u03b2 takes note of the accumulation of A\u03b2 produced from the nerve cell in the cerebral parenchymal region. Therefore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the detection of sAPP770\u03b2 enables diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by a principle different from the diagnosis by the detection of sAPP695\u03b2. This also means that diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on the combination of the detection of sAPP770\u03b2 and the detection of sAPP695\u03b2 can provide a more detailed diagnosis of the disease state of Alzheimer's disease than the individual diagnosis.",

                                "While human brain expresses APP mRNA isoforms APP695, APP751 and APP770 by 3 kinds of selective splices (Nature 1988 331(6156):525-527; Nature 1988 331(6156):528-530) (FIG. 1A), neuron expresses only for APP695 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1993 90 (20):9513-9517; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1990 87(4):1561-1565; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1989 86(16):6338-6342). Such information suggests cell type-specific APP splicing phenomenon occurs in the brain. In the present Example, the present inventors took note of cerebral endothelial cell, and analyzed cerebral endothelial APP using established primary human brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC). Western blot analysis using anti-APP C-terminal antibody (C15) has revealed that BMEC expresses APP at a level equivalent to or higher than that of primary neuron (FIG. 1B). Endothelial APP showed two separate bands with different gel mobility after SDS-PAGE. Since two endothelial APPs were detected by both anti-KPI antibody and anti-OX2 antibody, endothelial cell was concluded to express APP770. Since neuron APP was not detected by both anti-KPI antibody and anti-OX2 antibody, the previous report on the expression of only APP695 by neuron (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1993 90(20):9513-9517; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1990 87(4):1561-1565) was confirmed. When BMEC lysate was analyzed by anti-KPI antibody or anti-OX2 antibody, one additional band was found between two APP bands. This band is highly likely a processed form of APP or sAPP lacking the C-terminal sequence of APP. While human umbilical cord blood-derived vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) showed a remarkably lower expression level than that of BMEC, it expressed two kinds of the type of APP, thus showing wide expression of APP770 in endothelial cells.",
                                "To analyze APP transcript, the present inventors have isolated RNA from the endothelial cells and primary neuron. Then, the reversely transcribed cDNA sample was analyzed by PCR using a series of oligonucleotide primers to detect APP695, APP751 and APP770. As shown in FIG. 1C, the neuron expressed APP695, but the endothelial cell expressed APP770 and did not express APP695. These results have confirmed cell type-specific APP expression.",
                                "**Example 2**",
                                "The present Example explains sugar chain addition state of APP770.",
                                "Since APP may contain two N-linked and plural O-linked sugar chains (Biochim Biophys Acta 1999 1472(1-2):344-358; J Proteome Res 2009 8(2):631-642; J Biol Chem 1998 273(11):6277-6284), the present inventors have predicted that APP770 having high molecular weight (APP-H) is highly added with sugar chains. Based on the results of the series of lectin pull down assays (FIG. 2), APP-H and APP770 having low molecular weight (APP-L) were each separated by Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA)- and concanavalin A(ConA)-agarose, and digested with peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) to remove N-linked sugar chain. As shown in FIG. 4A, after the PNGase treatment, the two APP forms both moved slightly faster in SDS-PAGE gel than before the treatment. Therefore, it was shown that the both forms have an N-linked sugar chain, and the difference in the molecular weight of the both forms cannot be explained by N-linked sugar chain alone.",
                                "Since APP-H has affinity for SSA lectin that recognizes Sia\u03b12, 6Gal/GalNAc, the present inventors predicted that APP-H contains O-linked sugar chain having a sialic acid residue. After the sialidase treatment, the mobility of APP-H remarkably changed, and became close to that of APP-L (FIG. 4B). After the treatment with sialidase and O-glycosidase, the mobility of APP-H completely matched with that of APP-L. Since O-glycosidase cleaves unsubstituted core-1 type O-linked sugar chain alone, the present inventors have concluded that APP-H has a sialylated core-1 type O-linked sugar chain. When APP695, APP751 or APP770 was overexpressed in COS cells, the difference in the mobility between two forms of APP was always observed clearly for APP770 (FIG. 3). The data suggest the presence of O-linked sugar chain in OX2 region.",
                                "Thus, the present inventors have produced a series of APP770 variants wherein each Ser/Thr residue in the OX2 region was individually substituted by Ala (FIG. 4C). Then, wild-type APP770 and a variant thereof were overexpressed in COS cells. Although an O-linked sugar chain addition mechanism is not sufficiently developed in COS cells, the present inventors have detected APP-H at a low level (FIG. 4D). While mutation in Ser346, Ser348 and Thr352 did not affect the mobility of APP variant on SDS-PAGE gel, APPT353A variant (Thr353 was substituted to Ala) moved faster than the wild-type APP (FIG. 4D). The results suggest that the O-linked sugar chain is added to Thr353.",
                                "The finding that both APPT353A and APPOX2all (wherein all Ser/Thr residues in OX2 region were mutated to Ala) still showed two separate bands suggests further presence of an O-linked sugar chain addition site in a region other than the OX2 region of APP770. Perdivara et al. (J Proteome Res 2009 8(2):631-642) have recently showed that APP695 is modified with O-linked sugar chain in Thr291, Thr292 and Thr576. Thus, the present inventors have now produced APP770 variant APPall (which is APPOX2all wherein Thr291, Thr292, Thr651 (Thr576 for APP695) and Thr652 were further substituted by Ala). The APPall all showed an almost single band (FIG. 4D), which indicates that the present inventors mutated all O-linked sugar chain addition sites of APP770 in the APPall variant.",
                                "**Example 3**",
                                "The present Example explains sugar chain addition state of sAPP secreted from brain microvascular endothelial cell BMEC.",
                                "To analyze APP metabolite in endothelial cells, the present inventors performed Western blot analysis of BMEC lysate and medium samples by using an anti-APP 22C11 antibody (which recognizes APP N-terminal region). As shown in FIG. 5A, a single sAPP band having mobility between two bands of APP (APP-H and APP-L) found in the cell lysate was detected in the medium. This suggests that sAPP is derived solely from APP-H. In fact, sAPP is sensitive to both sialidase and O-glycosidase treatments (FIG. 5B), and this shows that sAPP contains sialylated core-1 type O-linked sugar chain.",
                                "It is noteworthy that the present inventors could not detect sAPP without an O-linked sugar chain. In consideration of the general aspect that cleavage of APP at the \u03b1 site seems to occur on the cell surface, whereas that at the \u03b2 site occurs in the endocytosis pathway (J Cell Biol 2003 160(1):113-123), a possibility was also considered that APP without O-linked sugar chain addition cannot move to the cell surface, and cannot contact any of \u03b1-secretase and \u03b2-secretase. However, the cell surface biotinylation experiment has revealed that APP-H and APP-L both reach the cell surface (FIG. 5C). Furthermore, benzyl GalNAc (inhibitor of O-linked sugar chain chain elongation) did not inhibit secretion of sAPP into the medium (FIG. 5D). These suggest that addition of one GalNAc to APP770 is sufficient for APP770 to enter the secretion pathway.",

                                "As for APP770 processing, since only limited information is available as to the expression levels and activities of endothelial \u03b1 secretase and \u03b2 secretase, the present inventors have analyzed soluble sAPP770 secreted from BMEC. When a specific antibody to sAPP\u03b1 and sAPP used, sAPP\u03b1 and sAPP13 were both detected (FIG. 6A).",
                                "Since endothelial cell has an amyloid-producing \u03b2 secretase pathway, these cells can be considered to also have \u03b3 secretase activity and produce A\u03b2 peptide. Both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected in a medium of BMEC that overexpresses APP770, and the ratio of endothelial A\u03b242/A\u03b240 was similar to that in neuron (FIG. 6B).",
                                "To clarify whether APP770 is actually expressed in cerebral blood vessel, the present inventors have first analyzed a cerebral cortex section by using an anti-OX2 antibody, and determined the localization of APP770. While the luminal region of endothelial cells of the vein and venule was stained with anti-OX2 antibody, smooth muscle cell was not stained (FIG. 6C). In arachnoid blood vessel, immunohistochemical signal was not observed.",
                                "Next, whether CSF contains sAPP770\u03b2 (\u03b2 secretase cleavage product on APP770 N-terminal side) was examined. sAPP was pulled down from CSF by using heparin-agarose, and immunostaining was performed using anti-APP22C11 antibody, anti-OX2 antibody and anti-sAPP\u03b2antibody. Two bands were detected by the anti-APP22C11 antibody, of which only the upper band was detected by the anti-OX2 antibody (FIG. 6D). This means that the upper band was derived from APP770. Detection of both the upper and lower bands with the anti-sAPP\u03b2 antibody means that the both forms contained \u03b2 secretase cleavage product. These results indicate that CSF obtained from the subject can be adopted as a sample for examining the presence or absence of sAPP770\u03b2 production by endothelial cells in the body."
