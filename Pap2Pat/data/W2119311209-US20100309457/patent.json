The light detector can receive a light projection at the surface from light passing through the aperture. The light detector can also separately measure amplitude and phase information of a wavefront at the aperture based on the received light projection.

                        "Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to phase sensing devices used in applications such as microscopy and photography. More specifically, certain embodiments relate to a wavefront imaging sensor (WIS) configured to measure phase variations and/or amplitude variations of a light field in a high Fresnel number regime.",
                        "A light field contains two primary sets of characteristics\u2014amplitude/intensity and phase front variations. At present, commercial optical sensors are designed to operate much like our retina and are only responsive to light field amplitude/intensity variations.",
                        "The phase of light is very important for imaging because many objects, such as transparent organisms and cells, only significantly modulate the phase of transmitted light and do not change the amplitude/intensity much. Sometimes, contrast agents (e.g., stains) can be used to generate amplitude/intensity variations in these transparent objects, however staining involves preparation and can damage specimens. For this reason and others, phase microscopes are highly valued in biomedical applications for their ability to render contrast based on refractive index variations in unstained biological samples. Such applications include field analyses of bloodborne and waterborne pathogens where cost considerations and ease-of-use are important, and analysis of biopsy sections to determine tumour margins during surgical procedures where rapid processing is critical. Phase microscopes are also useful where staining is undesirable or simply not an option. Such applications include examinations of oocytes and embryos during in-vitro fertilization procedures, and longitudinal imaging of live cells or organisms. Examples of these applications can be found in S. L. Stanley, \u201cAmoebiasis,\u201d Lancet 361, 1025-1034 (2003), M. M. Haglund, M. S. Berger, and D. W.

Sternberg, \u201cChanges of induction and competence during the evolution of vulva development in nematodes,\u201d Science 265, 114-118 (1994), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.",
                        "Conventional differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopes and, to a lesser extent, phase contrast microscopes and Hoffman phase microscopes have been the primary phase microscopes used in the past five decades. FIG. 1(a) is a schematic illustration of the underlying principle of a conventional DIC device (e.g., such as a conventional DIC microscope or camera). A conventional DIC device operates by interfering slightly displaced duplicate image light fields of polarized light. FIG. 1(b) is a schematic drawing of a conventional DIC device. An example of a phase contrast microscope can be found in F. Zernike, \u201cPhase contrast, a new method for the microscopic observation of transparent objects,\u201d Physics 9, 686-698 (1942). An example of a Hoffman phase microscope can be found in R. Hoffman, and L. Gross, \u201cThe modulation contrast microscope,\u201d Nature 254, 586-588 (1975). An example of a conventional DIC microscope can be found in G. Nomarski, \u201cNew theory of image formation in differential interference microscopy,\u201d Journal of the Optical Society of America 59, 1524-& (1969), and an imaging strategy used by a conventional DIC microscope can be found in \u201cDIC,\u201d http://www.microscopyu.com/articles/dic/dicindex.html, (2007). These three references are incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.",
                        "However, these conventional phase microscopes have several limitations. One major limitation of the techniques used by these conventional devices is that phase variations are inextricably mixed with the amplitude/intensity variations that arise from absorption and/or scattering by an object. As a consequence of this entanglement of amplitude and phase information, these conventional techniques do not provide quantitative phase measurements. This limitation can introduce ambiguities in the rendered image of the object. Another limitation of conventional DIC devices is that they use polarized light and depend on the polarization in their phase-imaging strategies. Since polarized light must be used, conventional DIC devices generate images of birefringent samples, such as muscle sections and collagen matrices that typically suffer from significant artifacts. An example of a DIC microscope that uses polarization in its phase-imaging strategy can be found in B. C. Albensi, E. V. Ilkanich, G. Dini, and D. Janigro, \u201cElements of Scientific Visualization in Basic Neuroscience Research,\u201d BioScience 54, 1127-1137 (2004), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Since polarized light must be used, these devices generate images of birefringent objects (e.g., potato starch storage granules) that typically suffer from significant artifacts. Furthermore, these techniques use elaborate and bulky optical arrangements that are expensive and require high maintenance. The relatively high cost of these systems prevents their broader use.",
                        "In recent years, other phase microscopy techniques have been developed such as 1) phase shifting interferometry schemes\u2014where two or more interferograms with different phase shifts are acquired sequentially and a phase image is generated therefrom, 2) digital holography or Hilbert phase microscopy\u2014where high frequency spatial fringes encoded on the interferogram are demodulated to generate the phase image, 3) swept-source phase microscopy\u2014where modulation in the interferogram generated by a wavelength sweep can be processed to create a phase image, 4) Polarization quadrature microscopy\u2014where phase images are generated by a polarization based quadrature interferometer, and 5) harmonically matched grating-based phase microscopy\u2014which makes use of non-trivial phase shifts between the different diffraction orders from a harmonic combination grating to generate phase images. Examples of these phase microscopy techniques can be found in K. Creath, \u201cPhase-measurement interferometry techniques,\u201d Prog. Opt. 26, 44 (1988), K. J. Chalut, W. J. Brown, and A.

However, as with phase contrast and conventional DIC microscopy, these advanced methods contain significant optical elements and have relatively steep learning curves. In addition, these phase microscopy techniques invariably require the use of a laser source to provide coherent light.",
                        "Another technique for calculating optical phase includes collecting two or three successive images of the specimen around its focal plane. An example of this technique can be found in A. Barty, K. A. Nugent, D. Paganin, and A. Roberts, \u201cQuantitative optical phase microscopy,\u201d Optics Letters 23, 817-819 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. This technique however, requires the physical actuation of the camera to be placed in three distinct positions in order to provide enough data to render a single phase image, and is therefore intrinsically limited in speed. In addition, the presence of a mechanical actuation system can also introduce undesirable vibrations to the microscope and potentially pose a challenge to sensitive experiments."

                        "Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Some embodiments include a WIS (wavefront imaging sensor) configured to measure the amplitude and/or phase variations of an image wavefront. The WIS has an aperture layer with one or more closely spaced apertures and a light detector receiving light through the aperture(s) in the form of light projection(s). The WIS also includes a transparent layer between the light detector and the aperture layer. The thickness of the transparent layer can be sized to locate the light detector at a self-focusing plane in the high Fresnel region to narrow the light projection(s). During operation, the light detector at the back of the WIS receives the light projection(s) and can measure the lateral movement of the narrowed light projection(s) due to a phase gradient of the image wavefront. The WIS can determine the phase gradient based on the lateral movement. The WIS can also sum up the intensity over each light projection to determine the amplitude or total intensity at each aperture. The WIS can generate one or more images of the object based on the measured amplitude and/or phase gradient information.",
                        "Some embodiments include a WIS that can be used in applications such as microscopy, photography, or other imaging devices. For example, an embodiment of a WIS can be used in place of a conventional camera in a standard bright-field microscope. The WIS can transform the bright-field microscope into a wavefront microscope that can provide both bright-field (transmitted light intensity) and phase gradient images. Since the WIS of some embodiments can detect light intensity/amplitude variations in addition to the phase variations, the WIS of these embodiments can replace sensors in digital cameras. Some other examples of applications that may benefit from the use the phase gradient measuring capability of the WIS include machine recognition, object ranging, and texture assessment. In addition, fields such as LASIK surgery and high-resolution retinal imaging can also benefit from the phase gradient measuring capability of the WIS.",
                        "The WIS of many embodiments provides advantages because the WIS can self focus the light in the high Fresnel number regime which narrows the light projections received by the light detector without the need of lenses. First, this self-focusing scheme is advantageous over conventional wavefront sensors such as Shack-Hartmann sensors which use microlenses to narrow light projections. By avoiding the need for lenses, the cost for WIS devices can be reduced. Also, since the light projections through the apertures are narrowed, the apertures can be arranged in a more dense fashion, which can provide more highly populated light data and improved sensor sensitivity. Further, the narrowing of light projections avoids crosstalk or interference between neighboring projections, which can also improve image quality.",
                        "Another advantage of the WIS of some embodiments is that it can implement phase gradient measuring functionality onto a simple sensor chip such as a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) chip. In some cases, the different layers of the WIS can be formed as part of the sensor chip fabrication process, which minimizes the cost. This implementation is advantageous over conventional phase sensing devices that use bulky optical elements to provide similar functionality. Since there are no bulky optical elements, the WIS can be more and robust (less optical elements to break), less expensive, and simpler in use and design than conventional phase sensing devices.",
                        "An imaging device employing a WIS of embodiments of the invention also provides advantages because it will not require polarized light as part of its imaging technique. Since the imaging device will does not depend on the polarization of the light (illumination), the imaging device can use unpolarized light to generate artifact-free phase gradient and intensity images for both birefringent and homogenous objects. Also, an ordinary illumination source can be used such as the illumination source used in a conventional microscope.",

                        "In one embodiment, a functionalized sensor chip employing a WIS 100 is capable of simultaneously measuring both the amplitude and the phase front variations of a light field. The WIS 100 comprises a substrate light detector 120 of a sensor pixel grid (pixel size=2.2 \u03bcm), a transparent layer 130 having an effective thickness=28 \u03bcm and an aperture layer 110 of 150 nm thick aluminium. The aperture layer 110 is a two-dimensional array of closely spaced apertures (spacing=11 \u03bcm, diameter=6 \u03bcm) patterned on aperture layer 110. By monitoring the tightly confined transmitted light projections (spots) in a high Fresnel number regime, the functionalized sensor chip can accurately measure both intensity and phase front variations. In this embodiment, the functionalized sensor chip is tested to have a measured normalized phase gradient sensitivity of 0.1 mrad under the typical working condition \u22121.0 second total signal accumulation time and 9.2 \u03bcW/cm2 light intensity on the sensor.",

Any suitable implementation technique can be used. For example, a color sensor chip having stratified color sensing sites (e.g. Foveon X3\u00ae color sensor chip) can be used as a substrate in a fabrication process similar to the one described above. In another example, the WIS capable color sensors can be built with the conventional color sensors with Bayer color pixel arrangements. In this example, a light projection (spot) localization algorithms is used. The functionalized sensor chip of this embodiment can replace a camera on a conventional microscope to add the capabilities of collecting phase gradient and/or intensity images in both color and/or black and white. In previous microscope systems, the user would need to switch between different cameras to collect these images.",

For example, a WIS 100 can replace a camera in a conventional bright field microscope to construct a WIS microscope system 200 having both bright field and phase gradient imaging capabilities (\u201cWavefront Microscope\u201d). The phase gradient images generated by the WIS microscope system 200 can be of better quality than images from a conventional DIC microscope since they are artifact-free and quantitative. In another example, a WIS 100 can replace sensor(s) in a digital camera to construct a WIS digital camera system 200 having both bright field and phase gradient imaging capabilities (\u201cWavefront Camera\u201d). The additional phase gradient sensing capability provided by the implementation of the WIS 100 can benefit various applications including, for example, machine recognition, object ranging, and texture assessment for a variety of applications.",

In FIG. 6(c), the WIS 100 is placed in communication with the conventional microscope 250 via its camera port. In some cases, the WIS 100 can be formed on a suitable sensor chip which is placed in communication with the camera port. In FIG. 6(c), the conventional microscope 250 includes an illumination source 150 such as a standard halogen microscope. In this example, the conventional microscope 250 also included a push-in DIC prism and polarizers, so that the conventional microscope 250 can be configured as a DIC microscope for comparison. Other embodiments would not need this DIC functionality. A sensor chip can be used to record the DIC images. An example of a suitable sensor chip is a CMOS optical sensor chip having 9.9 micron sensor pixels (e.g. MT9V403C12STM sensor chip manufactured by Micron technology, Inc.). In some cases, the conventional microscope 250 operates with a 40\u00d7, N.A.=0.75 objective having a resolution of 0.49 microns. As the conventional microscope 250 magnifies the image by the magnification factor, the projected image should have a resolution of 20 microns. In the illustrated example, the WIS 100 has an effective image pixel size of 11 microns. The WIS system 200 employing the WIS 100 can accomplish a resolution of 0.55 microns (only 10% off its specific resolution). In general, the WIS 100 of embodiments performs even better with higher magnification objectives. For example, a 60\u00d7, N.A.=0.9 objective and a 100\u00d7, N.A.=1.3 objective based microscope would be able to achieve their specific resolution of 0.41 microns and 0.28 microns, respectively, with the WIS system 200.",

However, the x-directional normalized phase gradient image taken by the Wavefront Microscope contains phase information orthogonal to the DIC image and our y-directional normalized phase gradient image, and reveals different details of the object. For example, dense bodies (identified by \u03b1 indicator) are clearly shown in y-directional normalized phase gradient image, while the vulva slit, furrow and annuli (identified by \u03b3 and \u03b2 indicators) on the skin are more obvious in x-directional normalized phase gradient image.",
