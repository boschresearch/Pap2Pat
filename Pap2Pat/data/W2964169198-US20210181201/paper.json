    "title": "The generation and use of recombinant extracellular vesicles as biological reference material",
    "date": "2019-07-23",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increase of extracellular vesicle (EV) research geared towards biological understanding, diagnostics and therapy. However, EV data interpretation remains challenging owing to complexity of biofluids and technical variation introduced during sample preparation and analysis. To understand and mitigate these limitations, we generated trackable recombinant EV (rEV) as a biological reference material. Employing complementary characterization methods, we demonstrate that rEV are stable and bear physical and biochemical traits characteristic of sample EV. Furthermore, rEV can be quantified using fluorescence-, RNA- and protein-based technologies available in routine laboratories. Spiking rEV in biofluids allows recovery efficiencies of commonly implemented EV separation methods to be identified, intra-method and inter-user variability induced by sample handling to be defined, and to normalize and improve sensitivity of EV enumerations. We anticipate that rEV will aid EV-based sample preparation and analysis, data normalization, method development and instrument calibration in various research and biomedical applications.",

                "Biofluids contain extracellular vesicles (EV) that differ in their biogenesis, molecular patterns and cellular origin1. EV are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative- and autoimmune- diseases, which has made EV an intensive field of research, especially for disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment2,3. However, EV research and its biomedical applications are hampered by the myriad of separation methods and measurement instruments and the lack of appropriate reference materials for accurate calibration, normalization and method development4\u20136. A reference material suitable for all those purposes should (1) have EV-like physical and biochemical characteristics, hence should be from biological origin; (2) be trackable and thus be distinguishable from sample EV and (3) behave similarly as sample EV under various experimental conditions7. Current reference materials for calibration are polystyrene beads, silica beads or liposomes, which lack EV-like properties such as surface markers and a mean refractive index (RI) of ~1.39, resulting in inaccurate measurements7\u20139. Biological reference materials derived from biofluids or cell cultures are commercially available but they lack specificity, rendering them less suitable for quality control applications. Reference materials for normalization and method assessment are not available. Recent approaches have tried to improve the EV-like properties of existing reference materials making them more suitable for restricted flow cytometry-based use10\u201312.",
                "To meet the need for appropriate reference materials, we have generated recombinant EV (rEV) as a trackable biological reference material resembling the physical and biochemical characteristics of sample EV. rEV find their origin in the major structural component of HIV-1 virus particles, the gag polyprotein. HIV-1 gag hijacks the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) pathway, responsible for the release of EV, and inserts itself in membrane areas with similar lipid/protein characteristics as EV budding areas13,14. Expression of the polyprotein gag alone suffices for the production of nanometer-sized immature virus like particles (VLP) surrounded by a lipid bilayer and enriched for gag molecules and EV-associated proteins14,15. The suitability of HIV-1 VLP as a reference material for EV research has not been previously considered or tested. Here we define the physical and biochemical characteristics, trackability, stability and commutability of rEV, identify and test suitable read-out methods, provide tools to segregate rEV from sample EV for further downstream approaches and demonstrate the usability of rEV in various applications."

Western blot and flow cytometry analysis for gag-EGFP protein expression and viability assays of HEK293T cells revealed that the transfections were reproducible and non-toxic (supplementary fig.\u00a01a-e). Transfection with gag-EGFP resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in EV secreted per cell compared to mock transfection (supplementary fig.\u00a01f).Fig. 1rEV are separated from conditioned medium using density gradient centrifugation. a Schematic representation of rEV showing representative molecular components shared with sample EV, PA phosphatidic acid, PC phosphatidylcholine, PE phosphatidylethanolamine, PI phosphatidylinositol, PS phosphatidylserine, SM sphingomyelin. b Schematic overview of the production of rEV at the cellular level: (1) The gag-EGFP fusion protein inserts in regions of the plasma membrane enriched for tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81 via its N-terminal MA domain containing a myristoyl group. (2) The gag-EGFP fusion protein oligomerizes and recruits ESCRT-1 proteins (TSG101) via the PTAP motive on its p6 domain. (3) Recruitment of ESCRT-2/3 proteins initiates the outward budding of the gag-EGFP containing plasma membrane. (4) ESCRT-3 mediated scission of the membranes finally causes release of rEV into the conditioned medium (CM)13. c Schematic overview of the workflow to separate rEV from CM of gag-EGFP transfected HEK293T cells. Seventy-two hour post transfection CM is collected from ~3 x 109 cells and concentrated to 1\u2009mL. Concentrated CM is loaded on top of an OptiPrep density gradient (ODG) and centrifuged for 18\u2009h at 100,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g.

To establish linear or semi-logarithmic regression curves for fluorescent microplate reader, western blot, ELISA and RT-qPCR analysis, rEV were quantified by fNTA. Based on fluorescence, a microplate reader allowed to linearly deduce rEV numbers in a defined concentration range of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u20131\u2009\u00d7\u20091010 rEV (Fig.\u00a03f).

OptiPrep velocity gradient (OVG) centrifugation18 physically segregated rEV from gag-EGFP\u00a0negative EV and resulted in near 100% fluorescent particles (supplementary fig.\u00a06a\u2013d). Western blot analysis for gag-EGFP protein and EV-associated proteins ALIX, flotillin-1, TSG101, syntenin-1, CD81 and CD9 revealed that gag-EFGP negative EV segregate in low density fractions (1.046\u20131.068\u2009g/mL, corresponding to OVG fractions 4\u20137) whereas rEV segregate in high density fractions (1.076\u20131.088\u2009g/mL, corresponding to OVG fractions 10\u201313) (supplementary fig.\u00a06a, b). rEV obtained by OVG centrifugation contained EV-associated proteins, EV-like size distribution and had a typical EV morphology as analyzed by, respectively, western blot, (f)NTA and TEM (supplementary fig. 6b\u2013e). Mass spectrometry-based proteome data indicated that gag-EGFP\u00a0negative EV segregated from rEV share 81% of the total number of detected proteins, further indicating the high similarity in protein composition of rEV and sample EV (supplementary fig.\u00a06j).

                "The need for a biological reference material for EV research and biomedical applications is increasingly recognized5,9,22. To meet this need, we have developed rEV, a gag polyprotein-induced mimic of EV. rEV were generated by reproducible transfection of HEK293T cells with gag-EGFP DNA followed by high-purity rEV separation from CM using density gradient centrifugation23. rEV are safe, since the viral genome, proteases and other viral proteins, which render viruses infectious are not present24. rEV show biochemical and physical traits characteristic of sample EV14,15,25\u201327: (1) equivalent lipid and protein profiles including the presence of intraluminal and membrane EV-associated proteins; and (2) equivalent cup-shaped morphology, size (50\u2013180\u2009nm), buoyant density (1.086\u20131.119\u2009g/mL), RI (1.37) and zeta potential (\u221232 mV). rEV are stable during lyophilization and long-term storage, ensuring convenient distribution and use. They contain exogenous mRNA and protein allowing quantification with multiple measurement instruments while ensuring adequate differentiation from sample EV. rEV are the first biological reference material for EV compatible with a plethora of applications including quality control, instrument calibration and data normalization (Fig.\u00a05g).",
                "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics revealed that rEV contain intraluminal and membrane proteins characteristic of sample EV including ALIX, TSG101, flotillin-1, syntenin-1, CD9, CD81 and CD63. In depth analysis for molecular function and biological processes revealed that rEV are enriched in proteins regulating RNA binding and nucleic acid metabolism (supplementary fig.\u00a04e). Gag polyprotein contains zinc-finger RNA binding domains and to form VLP, gag polyprotein must bind RNA28,29. In the absence of viral RNA, gag encapsulates host RNA and any single-stranded nucleic acid longer than \u223c20\u201330 nt can support VLP assembly, indicating a general propensity to bind abundant RNA30,31. Indeed, exogenous EGFP mRNA is encapsulated in rEV and allows for a reproducible quantification of rEV using EGFP or gag RT-qPCR assays. Fusion of EGFP to gag polyprotein results in the delivery of exogenous gag-EGFP protein to rEV allowing for a reproducible quantification of rEV using fluorescence-based fNTA, HR-FC and plate reader or protein-based p24 ELISA assays. Inherently, the number of spiked rEV appropriate for data normalization depends on the recovery efficiency of the separation method and the sensitivity of the rEV detection method. One or more of these detection methods are available in any routine laboratory allowing for a broad implementation of rEV. Thus, rEV can be differentiated from sample EV, including sample EV derived from body fluids of HIV patients, due to the presence of exogenous EGFP mRNA and gag-EGFP protein. rEV are highly adaptable and can be used to deliver RNA and proteins as part of gag or not, alike EGFP mRNA and protein, opening perspectives for custom-made rEV for multiple diagnostic and therapeutic applications32.",
                "The separation of rEV by ODG centrifugation from medium conditioned by gag-EGFP transfected HEK293T cells resulted in ~80% fluorescent particles, implying that not all particles contain gag-EGFP protein. Indeed, separation of rEV by OVG centrifugation resulted in ~100% fluorescent particles, indicating that EV generated by endogenous biogenesis of HEK293T cells are segregated from rEV. In comparison, other proposed fluorescent reference EV such as EV containing a membrane-associated form of GFP (palm-GFP)33 or lipophilic fluorophore stained EV (Hansabiomed Life Sciences) delivered less than 13% fluorescent particles as measured by fNTA (supplementary fig.\u00a012). Also, only 16% of EV containing tetraspanin-EGFP fusion proteins, recently proposed and validated as biological reference material for restricted use in flow cytometry platforms, were detectable by fNTA analysis12.",
                "rEV have a RI, a physical property determining the amount of light that is scattered by a certain material, equivalent to sample EV, indicating that rEV can be used as a calibrator for measurement instruments. To compare or reproduce EV research, exact enumeration of EV particles rather than indirect quantification via protein concentration measurements is recommended5. Flow cytometry and NTA are frequently used to quantify individual particles. Synthetic silica or polystyrene beads with a RI of respectively 1.45 and 1.61 are commonly used to calibrate these instruments. Since the RI determines the minimal size of particles detected with NTA and determines the relationship between scatter and size in flow cytometry, the average size and concentration of sample EV detected by these methods is underestimated7,8. Recent advances in the field of metrology have possibly bypassed this problem with the standardized production of hollow organosilica beads (HOB)10. Although HOB have an equivalent RI to sample EV, in contrast to rEV they do not contain EV-enriched surface markers, limiting their applicability to light scattering.",
                "To be fit for their intended use, rEV must be commutable, meaning that they must perform equally to sample EV undergoing the actual procedure34,35. We have demonstrated that rEV, modified or not by post-insertion PEGylation, act as sample EV when spiked in multiple biofluids. This allowed us to estimate the recovery efficiency of sample EV from plasma using commonly implemented separation methods including dUC, SEC and ODG centrifugation4. The recovery efficiency of dUC varied between 5 and 10%. This finding, together with previous reports showing that dUC co-pellets contaminants and disrupts sample EV23,36 further advices against the use of dUC to retrieve EV from plasma. SEC recovered rEV with 100% efficiency but, as previously reported, is unable to appropriately resolve sample EV from low density lipoproteins, chylomicrons and protein aggregates20,37,38. The use of ODG centrifugation to separate rEV from plasma resulted in 30% recovery efficiency. Nevertheless, the orthogonal implementation of size and density-based separation of sample EV has been reported to separate EV with very high specificity20,37. These examples illustrate that rEV can assist in identifying the performance of EV separation methods. In addition, in a clinical set-up rEV mitigated for intra-assay (manually prepared SEC columns, products from different batches) and inter-user (different time points, different sample handling) variability while separating EV from plasma samples of healthy donors and cancer patients resulting in increased sensitivity in EV enumerations. Indeed, recovery efficiencies of rEV varied between time points and donors (supplementary table\u00a02).",
                "After separation and recovery efficiency calculation, post-insertion PEGylation of rEV allows\u00a0for segregation of rEV-PEG from sample EV using anti-PEG antibodies. As such, rEV-PEG allows for normalization during separation but after segregation, they will not interfere with downstream analysis of sample EV composition (proteomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics) and function. rEV-PEG are compatible with EV separation methods that do not require immune capture by targeting EV surface proteins since antibody binding is sterically hindered by PEG.",
                "Interlaboratory evaluation and benchmarking of rEV to assess the applicability for data normalization, instrument calibration and quality control will be of great importance to stimulate their wide-spread use. Whether rEV, with a size distribution between 50 and 180\u2009nm, are appropriate as biological reference material for large EV (>200\u2009nm) remains to be investigated and is likely dependent upon the separation and measurement method of choice (use of size and large EV-specific protein versus other isolation or characterization methods).",
                "In conclusion, we propose rEV as a biological reference material to be implemented in EV separation methods and measurement instruments. rEV have equivalent buoyant density, size distribution, morphology, RI, zeta potential and molecular patterns (proteins and lipids) to sample EV. The gag-EGFP fusion protein enables sensitive and differential trackability of rEV. As such rEV are tailor-made for quality control, data normalization, method development and accurate calibration of optical and non-optical EV measurement methods (Fig.\u00a05g). The use of rEV will ensure rigorous sample EV analysis and is essential to advance the field and develop future EV-based biomedical applications."

This concentration of DMPE-PEG 5\u2009K was optimized using a DMPE-PEG-biotin construct (Nanocs, NY, USA) and precipitation using streptavidin coated magnetic beads. Using western blot analysis targeting EGFP we saw the highest signal in the precipitation and the lowest signal in the flow through at a concentration of 0.016\u2009mg/mL DMPE-PEG-biotin (supplementary fig.\u00a013c)."

The vials were placed on pre-cooled shelves at -45\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h after which the chamber pressure was lowered to 0.1 mbar. From the moment the desired pressure was reached, the shelf temperature was increased at 1\u2009\u00b0C/min to \u221225\u2009\u00b0C and maintained for 24\u2009h. When all ice was completely sublimated the temperature was increased at 0.15\u2009\u00b0C/min to the final drying temperature of 20\u2009\u00b0C and this temperature was maintained for 4\u2009h. Finally, the temperature was decreased again at 1\u2009\u00b0C/min to a storage temperature of 3\u2009\u00b0C while maintaining the vacuum until the cycle was stopped."
