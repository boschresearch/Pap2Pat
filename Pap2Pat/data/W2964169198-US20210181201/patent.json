                        "Liquid biopsies increasingly gain attention as a golden standard for future clinical use because of the lower risk for the patient, the possibility of treatment monitoring, the lesser cost and the heterogeneous view of the disease compared to tissue biopsies.1, 2 Since it is generally accepted that extracellular vesicles (EV) are present in body fluids and that they represent a fingerprint of the originating cell they are focused upon as a candidate to provide information for medical decision making.2, 3",
                        "EV are nanometer-sized vesicles secreted by all cell types and found circulating in body fluids like plasma, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, etc. They consist of a double lipid membrane surrounding its cargo of proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites making them useful conveyors of information as the lipid membrane provides protection against degradative proteins, such as proteases and RNAses, present in biofluids.4 EV are found to be implicated in cancer progression. They can be secreted by cancer cells and either activate or recruit cancer or stromal cells locally or educate a premetastatic niche at a distant location, and hereby facilitating metastasis formation.5, 6 Recently, EV isolated from different biofluids have been found to contain specific mRNA, miRNA and protein content related to disease state for breast, urogenital, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.7-10 However, little advances are made towards clinical application. This is mainly due to the fact that EV research is difficult to reproduce owing to the plethora of isolation methods used and a lack of standardization and normalization.11-13 The latter problems can be solved by using a standard reference material that has the same characteristics as sample EV, but can be easily distinguished from them.",
                        "Up to date there are few materials used as a reference material for EV research. Nanometer sized polystyrene or silica beads are often used as a calibrator for flow cytometry (FC) or nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). This usually leads to inaccurate measurements of EV as the refractive index (RI) of these beads is higher than the RI of EV (1.61, 1.46 vs 1.40).14, 15 Another alternative could be EV-inspired liposomes engineered to contain proteins and nucleic acids. However, natural EV are heterogeneous in size, and standards lacking this heterogeneity may consequently impact the standard reference settings of EV quantification methods. To overcome these problems, a biological reference material seems mandatory. A recent survey performed by researchers of the METVES program (Metrological characterization of micro vesicles from body fluid) indeed stated that an ideal EV reference material should be from biological origin and have the same physical and biochemical characteristics as sample EV and should preferably be distinguishable from them.16 US20130078658 discloses a recombinant EV comprising a fusion of a membrane protein and a light-emitting protein that can be used to quantify sample EV. However, the latter recombinant EV are difficult to be produced in high quantities and cannot be detected in a very sensitive manner."

                        "In this disclosure, the use of a particular kind of recombinant extracellular vesicle (rEV) was used as a biological reference material for EV research. These rEV are induced by self-assembling proteins that direct their own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein and further comprise a heterologous marker that can be fused to the self-assembling proteins. A non-limiting example of such a self-assembling protein is the retroviral group-specific antigen (Gag) fused to a heterologous marker such as the light-emitting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The physical and biochemical characteristics of density gradient purified particles from the supernatant of Gag-EGFP-transfected HEK293T cells and endogenous sample EV from different cell lines and biofluids at the level of NTA, (immune) electron microscopy, proteomics, lipidomics and zeta potential were analyzed and compared. The high abundance of fluorescent fusion proteins per particle can be exploited to deduce the amount of particles, as measured with fluorescent NTA, by measuring fluorescent signals with a fluorescent plate reader, high resolution FC or by measuring the concentration of, for example, the Gag polyprotein or, most preferably, by measuring the concentration of, for example, EGFP mRNA. It was shown that the latter non-fluorescence-based measurements are far more sensitive than the fluorescence measurements. It was further shown that rEV can be used as a reference material to spike in different biofluids prior to isolation and afterwards be tracked, giving the possibility to calculate the recovery rate of different EV isolation methods. The methods of this disclosure allow the end user to choose whether he wishes to isolate the reference material together with the sample EV or separated from the sample EV. In addition, it is disclosed herein that rEV can be used to calibrate a device for analyzing sample EV and that rEV can be used to evaluate EV isolation methods. Taken together, the methods of this disclosure clearly enable the comparison of results between different research groups, and support the use of EV measurements for the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic decision making of diseases such as, but not limited to, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",
                        "This disclosure thus provides for a method to determine the recovery rate of sample EV, the method comprising:\n\n\n- - mixing a biofluid sample comprising sample EV with a known amount of\n    rEV wherein rEV comprise: a) a self-assembling protein that directs\n    its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound\n    protein, and b) a heterologous marker, to obtain a mixture,\n  - isolating the EV from the mixture,\n  - detecting the amount of the rEV among the isolated EV, and\n  - determining the recovery rate of the sample EV based on the ratio of\n    the amount of rEV after the isolation step to the known amount of\n    rEV mixed with the biofluid sample before the isolation step.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201csample extracellular vesicle (sample EV)\u201d refers to endogenous EV present in a sample, such as a biofluid, taken from a patient. The term \u201cendogenous EV\u201d refers to membrane-structured vesicles that are secreted by a wide range of cell-types including red blood cells, tumor cells and immune cells.4 Endogenous EV are known to be released in both normal and pathological conditions and are known to contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids such as miRNAs, and metabolites. It has been disclosed that the amounts of various types of, for example, miRNAs present in endogenous EV correlate with particular diseases.17 Hence, accurate quantification of EV in EV-based diagnostics is crucial.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201crecombinant extracellular vesicles (rEV)\u201d refers to EV obtainable by transfecting an appropriate host cell with DNA encoding for \u201ca self-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein\u201d and with DNA encoding for \u201ca heterologous marker.\u201d The latter \u201cheterologous marker\u201d can thus be provided by direct transfer into producer cells using cell-transfection procedures known to a person skilled in the art. For heterologous markers consisting of RNA, this molecule can be supplied either in its native form (i.e., unprotected) or in a protected form. Protected RNA relates to modifications in the RNA molecule that enhance the stability of the molecule by reducing RNase activity (see Fisher T L, Terhorst T, et al. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res, 21:3857-3865). Examples of modifications are phosphorothioate bonds, 2\u2032-O-methyl bases and 2\u2032fluoro bases. Alternatively, and as indicated above, the heterologous RNA molecule can be transcribed from an expression cassette, either transfected in cells as a double stranded DNA fragment, as part of a plasmid, or after integration of the expression cassette in the genome. In its simplest form, an expression cassette consists of a promoter, a sequence that is transcribed and a sequence that terminates transcription. Additional elements can be added to improve the transcription process: 1) the transcribed DNA fragment can be fused directly to the DNA that encodes the self-assembling protein; 2) the transcribed DNA encodes a heterologous marker protein (a luminescent, fluorescent or any other detectable protein) that is translated as a fusion protein to the self-assembling protein.",
                        "The heterologous RNA marker molecule can be recruited to the vesicles by a-specific binding to the self-assembling protein (see M. Comas-Garcia et al., eLife 2017 (6): 1-27) or by specific recruitment to the self-assembling protein via the retroviral packaging signal psi (see M. Comas-Garcia et al., eLife 2017 (6): 1-27). Alternatively, the heterologous marker is recruited by a nucleotide-binding polypeptide that recognizes a specific nucleotide target sequence. To this end, the nucleotide-binding polypeptide is fused directly to the self-assembling protein. Non-limiting examples of RNA-binding polypeptides are Lambda N, RNA-binding domain of MS2, NS3 and Cas9. The nucleotide target sequence can be used directly as heterologous marker, or can be fused to the heterologous marker sequence. Non-limiting examples of nucleotide target sequences are NutL, MS2, NS3 aptamers and gRNAs.",
                        "The terms \u201cheterologous marker\u201d mean a marker derived from a different organism than the organism from which the sample EV are under examination, or a synthetic marker, not originating from any existing organism. The term \u201cmarker\u201d as used herein refers to a measurable, heterologous protein or nucleic acid whose detection indicates the presence of a rEV of this disclosure. A preferred heterologous protein marker of the disclosure is a light-emitting protein as is also defined further.",
                        "Hence, this disclosure further relates to a method as described above wherein the heterologous marker is a heterologous nucleic acid molecule or a heterologous protein.",
                        "Furthermore, this disclosure relates to a method as described above wherein the heterologous protein is fused to the self-assembling protein.",

A skilled person will understand that also other techniques to quantify the amount of heterologous nucleic acids such as nanostring (see Geiss et al., Nature Biotechnology 26 (2008):317-325), branched DNA amplification (see Collins et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25 (1997):2979-2984) or serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE; see M. Yamamoto et al., J. Immunol. Methods 250 (2001):45-66) can be used.",
                        "As a preferred embodiment, the disclosure further relates to a method as described above wherein the heterologous protein is a light-emitting protein or wherein the heterologous nucleic acid is light-emitting protein mRNA.",
                        "The term \u201ca self-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein\u201d means a protein that comprises: a) a membrane insertion domain that is a protein domain that directly inserts in the double lipid layer or that recruits a lipid chain for insertion. A non-limiting example of such a domain is the MA domain of the well-known retroviral group-specific antigen (Gag), b) a self-assembling domain that is a protein domain that is responsible for oligomerization. The latter is required for a tight packing of proteins in a small domain of the lipid membrane, so that one vesicle contains a high amount of copies of that same protein. A non-limiting example of such a domain is the CA domain in the Gag polyprotein, and c) a late budding domain that is a protein domain that comprises a PTAP, PPXY or FPIV amino acid sequence for recruitment of ESCRT proteins required for vesicle morphogenesis. A non-limiting example of such a domain is the P6 domain of the Gag polyprotein.18, 19 Non-limiting examples of such a \u201cself-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein\u201d are\u2014besides Gag\u2014Gag variations as described by Coffin and Hughes,20 the influenza M1 proteins as described by Lamb and Krung,21 the Arrdc1 protein as described by Kuo et al.,22 the Ebola virus VP40 protein as described by Harry et al.,23 the Arc protein as described by Pastuzyn et al.24 and the M proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus as described by Justice et al.25",
                        "Hence, the disclosure relates to methods as described above and as described further wherein the self-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein is chosen from the group consisting of: the retroviral group-specific antigen, retroviral group-specific antigen variations, the influenza M1 protein, the Arrdc1 protein, the Arc protein, the Ebola virus VP40 protein and the M proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus.",

                        "As used herein, the term \u201clight-emitting protein\u201d refers to any protein that emits light by a change in physical conditions or by a chemical process. Non-limiting examples of such proteins are fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein, luminescent proteins, photoproteins or luciferase. The light-emitting protein is positioned inside the rEV as is\u2014for example\u2014explained in detail in US 20130078658. Hence, the present disclosure provides a method as described above wherein the light-emitting protein is a fluorescent protein or a luminescent protein. The present disclosure specifically provides a method as described above wherein the fluorescent protein is green fluorescent protein.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cbiofluid sample\u201d (which contains sample EV) can be any suitable biofluid taken from the body or in vitro cultures. Non-limiting examples of such biofluids are plasma, serum, blood, urine, mucus, saliva, stool, brocheoalveolar fluid (BALF), sweat, vitreous humor, tear drops or culture medium derived from in vitro cell or tissue cultures. However, the present disclosure specifically provides a method that is described further as a second embodiment wherein the biofluid sample is a plasma or serum sample as these biofluids may contain endogenous Immunoglobulins such as IgM and/or IgG.",
                        "After mixing a biofluid sample comprising sample EV with a known amount of rEV, the method comprises isolating both types of EV using any type of isolation method such as any type of density-based isolation method, size-based isolation, protein-based isolation, precipitation-based isolation, electrotatic-based isolation, acoustic-based isolation, microfluidics-based isolation or lipid-based isolation.13, 26-30",
                        "Detecting the amount of the rEV among the isolated EV can be\u2014as already mentioned above\u2014undertaken by qPCR or any other method as described above for light-emitting protein mRNA or any other heterologous nucleic acid. In other words, quantification of the rEV can be performed using any appropriate method known in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods are fluorescence intensity measurement methods using a fluorescence microplate reader, FC, fluorescent NTA (fNTA), qPCR for light-emitting protein mRNA or an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay against a subunit of the \u201cself-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein\u201d or the light emitting protein.",
                        "The method of the disclosure further includes determining the recovery rate of the sample EV from a ratio of the amount of rEV after isolation to the known amount of rEV added to the sample, which contains the sample EV, before isolation. The ratio of the rEV after isolation to the known amount of the rEV added to the sample containing sample EV can be calculated and used in calculating the recovery rate of the sample EV. The latter recovery rate can be used in quantifying and normalization of\u2014for example\u2014miRNAs or proteins in a sample obtained from a patient and can thus be used in diagnosis based on sample EV.",
                        "In another embodiment, the disclosure more specifically relates to a method as described above, wherein the isolation step comprises a separation step and/or is combined with a separation step in order to obtain a first fraction comprising the rEV and a second fraction comprising the sample EV, wherein detecting of the amount of the rEV occurs in the first fraction. The latter separation step is preferably a density-based separation step. However, since this separation is based on the adherence of immunoglobulins to the rEV it can also be achieved by immunocapturing the rEV with for instance (magnetic) beads expressing anti-IgM/anti-IgG antibodies on its surface. The above-mentioned separation can also be achieved by using a high resolution FC that can sort vesicles based on a fluorescent signal as explained by Van de vlist et al.31 The step of \u201cdetecting the amount of the rEV in the first fraction\u201d can be undertaken by, for example, a fNTA analysis, qPCR for light emitting protein mRNA or, an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay against a subunit of the self-assembling protein.",
                        "After mixing a biofluid sample comprising sample EV with a known amount of rEV, the method described in this embodiment comprises separating both types of EV using any type of separation method resulting in a first fraction comprising the rEV and a second fraction comprising the sample EV. This surprising and unique feature of the method of the present disclosure allows the end user to isolate the rEV separated from the sample EV. This allows further downstream analysis of sample EV without disturbance by rEV. This unique feature is due to the fact that immunoglobulin proteins, such as IgM and/or IgG, endogenously present in the biofluid sample or exogenously added to the rEV bind to the surface of the rEV as a consequence of the outer membrane orientation of specific lipids (phosphatidylserine or lysophosphatidylcholine). These lipids are then recognized by antibodies, such as IgM and/or IgG, as a Damage/Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP/PAMP).32, 33",
                        "Non-limiting examples of the separation methods, preferably density-based isolation methods, are density gradient ultracentrifugation and density cushion centrifugation.",

                        "After separating both types EV, the method of the latter embodiment of the disclosure includes the step of detecting or quantifying the amount of the rEV in the first fraction. Quantification of the rEV can be performed using any appropriate method known in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods are fluorescence intensity measurement methods using a fluorescence microplate reader, FC, fNTA, qPCR for light-emitting protein mRNA or an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay against a subunit of the \u201cself-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein\u201d or the light emitting protein. Hence, the present disclosure further provides a method as described above wherein detecting the amount of the rEV in the first fraction is undertaken specifically by high resolution FC or fNTA analysis, or, qPCR for light emitting protein mRNA and an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay against a subunit of the self-assembling protein that directs its own release through vesicles as a luminal membrane-bound protein.",
                        "Moreover, and as stated above, the method of the disclosure actually allows the end user to choose whether he wishes to isolate the rEV together with the sample EV or separated from the sample EV. Indeed, the disclosure also provides a method as described above wherein the mixture is treated with a protease before the density-based isolation so that the rEV and the sample EV are present in the same density fraction after the density-based isolation. Any protease such as papain, trypsin or subtilisin can be used. However, the present disclosure specifically provides a method as described above wherein the protease is proteinase K. In order to have the rEV and the sample EV present in the same density fraction, the rEV can be incubated with lipid conjugated PEG prior to mixing the rEV with the biofluid sample. In this method the lipid conjugated PEG\u2014for example DMPE-PEG\u2014inserts in the membrane of the rEV orienting the low molecular weight PEG chains to the exterior of the rEV. This exterior orientation of the low molecular weight PEG chains then sterically inhibits the adherence of immunoglobulins to the surface of the rEV. After isolation of the rEV incubated with lipid conjugated PEG and the sample EV in the same density fraction, the rEV incubated with lipid conjugated PEG can be separated from the sample EV by immune precipitation using anti-PEG antibodies. Hence, the present disclosure relates to a method as described above wherein the rEV incubated with PEG and the sample EV isolated in the same fraction after the isolation are incubated with anti-PEG-coated magnetic beads so that the rEV incubated with PEG are separated from the sample EV. A skilled person will understand that also other techniques to capture the recombinant extracellular vesicles incubated with PEG like immunecapture in microfluidic devices, immune affinity chromatograpy or immunecapture on coated plastic wells can be used.",
                        "On the other hand, the present disclosure also provides a method as described above wherein the rEV are incubated with immunoglobulin proteins such as IgG and/or IgM before mixing the biofluid with a known amount of the rEV so that the rEV and the sample EV are present in a different fraction after the separation step. The latter method is suited especially for biofluid samples that contain trace amounts or no endogenous immunoglobulin proteins.",
                        "Nanometer sized polystyrene or silica beads are often used as a calibrator for FC or NTA. This usually leads to inaccurate measurements of EV as the refractive index (RI) of these beads is higher than the RI of EV (1.61, 1.46 vs 1.40). This higher RI results in increased scattering and consequently wrong device settings for EV measurements that have a lower RI and thus scatter less light.14, 15 A biological reference material with the same RI as sample EV is required to calibrate these devices.16 By means of NTA and MIE theory calculations,14 the RI of the recombinant extracellular vesicles could be accurately determined and found to be equal to the RI of the sample extracellular vesicles.",

Transfection efficiency, calculated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, was on average 75% (FIGS. 1e, 1f) with no significant changes in morphology and cell viability compared to MOCK-transfected cells (FIGS. 1c, 1d). Western Blot analysis for EGFP of 6 transfections at different time points proved that Gag-EGFP transfection was reproducible (FIGS. 1g, 1h). Expression of the Gag-EGFP fusion protein resulted in more than 5 times more particles per cell compared to MOCK-transfected cells (FIG. 2a).",

The average zeta potential for rEV in water was similar to those of EV from different cell lines and biofluids (\u221234 mV) and Western blot analysis of all top-to-bottom ODG fractions from CM of GAG-EGFP and MOCK-transfected HEK293T cells identified EV enriched proteins TSG101, CD81 and Alix in fraction 8-9 corresponding to a buoyant density of 1.094 g/mL (FIGS. 2c, 2d).26 EGFP was characterized by a Gaussian distribution, with the highest protein levels in the EV enriched fraction of CM. EM images visualized a heterogeneous population of vesicles in rEV and MOCK EV samples with similar morphology and size distributions, in agreement with NTA measurements (FIGS. 2e, 2f).

The CD63 smear differed between rEV and MOCK EV, and EV isolated from MCF7 cells. Immune capture of rEV with anti-CD81, anti-CD63 or anti-CD9-coated magnetic beads confirmed the co-isolation of CD81, CD63 or CD9 with GAG-EGFP (FIG. 3b). Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) with a gold labelled secondary antibody recognizing anti-CD63 antibody targeting an epitope in the large extracellular loop, confirmed the presence of CD63 in the membrane of rEV (FIG. 3c).",

In the group of proteins that were equally expressed in rEV and MOCK EV (n=823), most EV-associated proteins were found (FIG. 3d). When ESCRT-associated proteins were compared, proteins that play a role in EV biogenesis, with rEV and MOCK EV enriched and equally expressed proteins, it was found that 27 ESCRT-associated proteins were equally expressed in rEv and MOCK EV; only 2 were significantly enriched in MOCK EV, whereas no ESCRT-associated proteins were significantly enriched in rEV (FIG. 3e).",

FC and fNTA detected similar relative amounts of three biological replicates of rEV. rEV was measured in triplicate in a 2/3 dilution series in PBS with a fluorescence plate reader. A linear signal trend was obtained from 1010 to 2*108 particles, with a mean R2 of 0.969 for three biological replicates (FIG. 5d). Western blot for EGFP on a series of \u00bd dilutions of rEV in PBS identified a lower detection limit of 7.8*107 particles, with a narrow linear range from 109 to 4*108 particles (FIG. 5c). With a commercial ELISA kit for P24, a subunit of the Gag polyprotein, the concentration P24 (ng/mL) could be correlated to the amount of particles (as quantified by fNTA). This technique was found to be the most sensitive with a linear concentration range from 107 to 106 particles suspended in PBS in a \u00bd dilution series in triplicate with a mean R2 of 0.978 for three biological replicates (FIG. 5e). RFU signals and P24 concentrations obtained with a fluorescence plate reader and an anti-P24 ELISA, respectively, differed between different batches of rEV.

                                "PBS or healthy donor plasma was spiked with rEV and performed SEC, differential ultracentrifugation (dUC), Exoquick precipitation and ODG. The recovery of rEV, and thus the efficiency of the isolation method, was evaluated by Western blot for EGFP and quantified by fNTA and anti-P24 ELISA.",
                                "Western blot analysis for EGFP revealed that rEV elutes in similar fractions as sample EV after isolation with SEC (FIG. 7a). When spiked in PBS, rEV elutes in fractions 4 to 6, which corresponds to the TSG101 signal of EV from MCF7-Rab27b cells (FIG. 7a). rEV spiked in plasma elutes in the same fractions as plasma sample EV (FIG. 7a). The EGFP signal in fraction 6 was masked by the co-elution of abundant plasma proteins (albumin). Quantification of R-EV by fNTA and anti-P24 ELISA revealed an isolation efficiency of nearly 100% (FIG. 7b).",
                                "Next, SEC fractions 4 to 6 from plasma spiked with rEV were concentrated to 1 mL and loaded on top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient. After 18 hours centrifugation at 100,000 g, all top to bottom fractions were collected. Western blot analysis and fNTA measurements revealed that rEV was localized in higher density fractions 12-13 (1.14-1.18 g/mL), in contrast to plasma sample EV, localized in fractions 8-9 (FIGS. 8a, 8b). Electron microscopy and Western blot analysis identified rEV aggregation and interaction with plasma proteins including immunoglobulins (IgG) (FIGS. 8b, 8c). Quantification with fNTA revealed an isolation efficiency of only 27.5% in ODG fractions 12-13 (data not shown). Aggregation of rEV only seemed to occur when spiked in plasma, since 40% of rEV particles were retrieved after ODG centrifugation when spiked in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS (FIG. 8d). When performing a bottom-up or top-down ODG on urine spiked with rEV all rEV particles could be found in the endogenous EV enriched density fractions (FIG. 8e). This shift in density could also be mimicked by incubation of the rEV particles with 100 \u03bcg IgM or 5 mg IgG isolated from healthy human serum prior to spike in PBS and isolation via ODG (FIG. 8f).",
                                "Alternatively, a proteinase K (PK) treatment was performed (1 mg/mL for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C.) on the concentrated SEC fractions of the spiked plasma prior to ODG centrifugation. PK treatment shifted rEV from density fractions 12-13 to 8-9 (FIG. 8a). To remove iodixanol remnants, ODG fractions 8 and 9 were pooled and subjected to SEC. Fractions 4 to 7 were collected and quantified by fNTA. This revealed an isolation efficiency of 30% (FIG. 7c). PK treatment did not influence the isolation of plasma sample EV since the amount of particles was similar for untreated plasma and the EV markers syntenin-1 and flotillin-1 were still detected by Western blot analysis after isolation by SEC-ODG (FIGS. 8g, 8h). Although this density shift is a unique feature to separate rEV from EV, it is not tailor-made for other EV isolation methods and it may be incompatible with certain downstream applications. Therefore, rEV was modified by post-insertion PEGylation to avoid plasma protein interactions while providing the unique opportunity for proteinase-independent separation of spiked rEV from EV in any biofluid (FIG. 9a). Surface masking of rEV by DMPE-PEG (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine conjugated to polyethylene glycol) does not alter fluorescence intensity and size distribution, but prevents the interaction with plasma proteins (FIG. 9b). More than 85% of rEV-PEG spiked in plasma floats at similar densities as EV (1.086-1.119 g/mL). Immune precipitation using anti-PEG-coated magnetic beads specifically captures rEV-PEG compared to rEV (FIG. 9c).",
                                "rEV could also be isolated when spiked in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS after ODG centrifugation followed by high speed pelleting (100,000 g for 3 hours), but this with very low efficiency (2 to 7% of the initially spiked amount was retrieved) (FIG. 7d). Since ODG centrifugation had a recovery of 40% (fNTA on pure ODG fractions 8-9), it was hypothesized that high speed pelleting of EV could be responsible for such a great loss. This was tested by flushing the bottom of a UC tube with 1 mL of PBS after resuspension of the pellet in 100 \u03bcL PBS until no fluorescent signal could be detected by fNTA and observed that more EV stuck to the bottom of the tube than could be resuspended in low volumes of PBS (100 \u03bcL) (FIG. 7e). To check whether the adherence to the bottom and probably also to the wall of the tube was not an artefact of rEV itself, these experimental conditions were repeated with EV isolated from MCF7-Rab27b cells spiked in PBS and concluded similar observations as with rEV. dUC on plasma spiked with rEV recovered around 10% rEV as measured with fNTA and ELISA (FIG. 7f). This low recovery was probably caused by the bottom/wall adherence as described above.",

The total number of EV and rEV are quantified by NTA and fNTA, respectively. The inter-user variation, expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), is reduced by 66% (from 17.5% to 6.1%) by normalization according to rEV isolation efficiencies (FIG. 9d). In a proof of concept experiment, 5\u00d71010 fluorescent rEV particles were spiked in 2 mL plasma from breast cancer patients (n=18) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n=6). EV and rEV were next isolated from the PK-treated spiked plasma samples through a combination of SEC-ODG-SEC and quantified the total amount of isolated vesicles and the fluorescent rEV via NTA and fNTA, respectively. From the latter quantification, the recovery of each EV isolation is calculated and the total amount of vesicles is normalized based on this recovery. EV concentrations per mL plasma normalized according to rEV isolation efficiencies are increased by 2.2 fold (p=0.0023, Mann-Whitney test) in breast cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. This fold change is of higher significance after normalization compared to the absolute values (p=0.0023 vs p=0.2204, Mann-Whitney test) (FIG. 9e)."
