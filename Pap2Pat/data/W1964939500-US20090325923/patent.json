                "The present invention relates to the use of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide for the preparation of a medicament used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The invention relates also to a process to manufacture a medicament for treating inflammatory diseases and finally to a pharmaceutical kit comprising such inhibitor.",
                "The preparation of a class of compounds, comprising several subclasses, which act as inhibitors of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl nucleotide, and their use thereof as anti-tumour agents, is already described in the patent applications WO0050399, WO97/48695, WO97/48397, WO99/31063, WO9931060, WO9931087, WO9931064, WO00/50399, and WO0380054. Especially useful compounds are described in the PCT application WO9748696.",
                "One of these inhibitors, (E)-N-[4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-acrylamide also known as APO866, FK866, WK175, or WK22.175 and hereinafter referred to as FK866 [International Non-proprietary Name], is especially described in the literature as an anticancer agent.",
                "FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases implicating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer. It has been demonstrated in the prior art that FK866 interferes with nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide (also known and hereinafter referred to as NAD) biosynthesis and induces apoptotic cell death without any DNA damaging effects.",
                "Antiangiogenic and antitumoral efficacy of FK866 are described in many publications.",
                "The publication \u201cFK866, a high specific non-competitive inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, represents a novel mechanism for induction of tumor cell apoptosis\u201d, M. Hasmann et al., Cancer Research 63, 7436-7442, Nov. 1, 2003 describes more generally FK866 as the first high potent and specific inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and its characteristics as antitumor compound.",
                "For example, its efficacy as antitumor agent for the treatment of leukaemia is described in \u201cWK175, a novel antitumor agent, decreases the intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration and induces the apoptotic cascade in human leukaemia cells\u201d, K. Wosikowski et al., Cancer Research 62, 1057-1062, Feb. 15, 2002.",
                "Its efficacy as antitumor agent for the treatment of renal carcinoma is demonstrated in \u201cantiangiogenic potency of FK866/K22.175, a new inhibitor of intracellular NAD biosyntheses, in murine renal cell carcinoma\u201d, J. Dreves et al., Anticancer Research 23: 4853-4858 (2003).",
                "EP 1 348 434 describes the use of pyridyl amides including FK866 as inhibitors of angiogenesis. According to this document a number of diseases are characterized by unregulated angiogenesis such as inflammatory disorder, proliferative retinopathies, rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration, preneoplastic lesions, benign prostatic hyperplasia, venous neointimal hyperplasia and psoriasis. However, EP 1 348 434 only describes the effect of FK 866 on angiogenesis in a murine renal cell carcinoma. Moreover, it is probable that for most inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, angiogenesis is a consequence, rather than a cause, of inflammation.",
                "Considering the above-mentioned completely different known medical indications of known inhibitors to the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide, the activity of the compounds used according to the invention with advantageous therapeutic properties for inflammatory diseases was completely surprising for the person skilled in the art.",
                "The notion of inflammatory diseases delineates a heterogeneous group of pathologies that involve innate or adaptive immune system components and characterized by chronic inflammation in the absence of infection or seemingly unprovoked. Examples of these diseases are hereditary periodic fevers, Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial mediterranean fever, familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, the metabolic disorders gout and pseudogout, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.",
                "Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are cytokines produced by cells of the innate immune system upon microbial activation, and are important mediators of both local and systemic inflammation. In many instances, the secretion of these cytokines is deregulated in inflammatory diseases leading to chronic inflammation.",
                "Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 production is beneficial in several inflammatory diseases, and numerous efforts have been devoted in the design of novel therapies aimed at blocking the production and/or the biological effects of these important pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
                "In the present invention, unexpected anti-inflammatory properties of the inhibition of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide have been identified. By inhibiting nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide biosynthesis, it was surprisingly found that TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 secretion are inhibited.",
                "In the present invention, it is demonstrated that optimal proinflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6, require adequate nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide intracellular concentration.",
                "In view of this art, the finding that inhibitors of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide have activities which make them particularly suitable in an excellent manner for the therapy of inflammatory diseases was completely unexpected.",
                "The present invention establishes a functional link between metabolism and inflammation, and demonstrates a potential important role for NAD-dependent enzymes in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6.",

                "The expression \u201cnon-competitive inhibitor\u201d as used herein defines a substrate molecule which always binds to the enzyme at a site other than the enzyme's active site. The binding affects the activity of the enzyme because the presence of the inhibitor causes a change in the structure and shape of the enzyme but it doesn't change the apparent binding affinity of the normal enzyme substrate.",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in the development and maintenance of the disease, and blocking of TNF or IL-1 for alleviating symptoms of RA is now well established in clinical practice. Male DBA/1 mice between 8-10 weeks of were immunized intradermally at the base of tail with 100 \u03bcg of native type II collagen (CII), emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 5 mg/ml mycobacterium tuberculosis. Twenty-one days later, the mice were boosted with 100 \u03bcg collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant intradermally at the base of the tail. From day 15 after the first immunization onward, mice are examined daily for the onset of clinical arthritis. The severity of arthritis is scored on a 3-point scale, where 0=normal appearance, 1=mild swelling and/or erythema, 2=pronounced swelling and erythema, and 3=joint rigidity. Each limb is graded, resulting in a maximal clinical score of 12 per animal. Treatment with FK866 was administered twice daily at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally for a total of 15 days from the day when CIA became clinically detectable (clinical scoring\u22671). Results shown in FIG. 8 indicate that FK866 ameliorates the symptoms of arthritis in an animal model of RA."

                                "This example describes that FK866-targeted enzyme NAMPT expression is upregulated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). During CIA, the level of NAMPT was significantly elevated in sera and paw tissue extracts from arthritic mice compared to non-arthritic na\u00efve controls as measured by ELISA (FIGS. 9a and b, respectively). These results were also supported by NAMPT immunohistochemistry. Indeed, we found massive staining of arthritic paw and knee joints from CIA, but markedly reduced staining in non-arthritic joints or joints from na\u00efve mice. In affected joints, NAMPT staining was prominent in synoviocytes of the synovial lining layer (SLL), sub-intimal synovium and pannus (P) and in some inflammatory cells. Most of the blood vessels were also positive. In addition, some positive chondrocytes were observed in both normal and arthritic joints.",

                                "This example illustrates that NAMPT inhibition with FK866 reduces established collagen-induced arthritis. FK866 was administered from the day following the appearance of the first clinical symptoms of arthritis, and continued for 15 days. FK866 had a marked protective dose-dependent effect on CIA, with a maximal therapeutic effect when administered at 10 mg/kg (FIG. 10a). The beneficial effect was apparent within 10 days following the commencement of treatment, and with an activity similar to etanercept (anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment) (FIG. 10b). To gain more insight into the inhibitory mechanism of action of FK866 on CIA, we repeated the CIA curative experiment using the optimal dose of FK866 and analyzed more parameters. Paws from FK866-treated mice showed minimal signs of inflammation after 2 weeks of treatment whereas paws from placebo-treated mice were still inflamed, and this was also reflected in the clinical scoring. Additionally, these in vivo clinical observations were consistent with histology of knees and paws, where much less inflammation was observed in the FK866-treated group. Knee joints of placebo mice and mice treated with FK866 were assessed for inflammatory infiltrate and synovial hyperplasia. Histological sections revealed a statistically significant decrease in inflammatory infiltrate and hyperplasia in mice treated with FK866 as compared to placebo-treated controls. Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) levels, which reflect the systemic inflammatory response, were decreased in FK866-treated mice (FIG. 10c), further suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of FK866 administration. Amongst the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the amelioration of CIA by FK866 is the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Expression of different cytokines was investigated in paw tissue extracts at the end of the experiment. TNF\u03b1 was below the level of detection of the assay Locally produced IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were significantly reduced in FK866-treated animals. MCP-1 was decreased, and finally IL-10 secretion remained unchanged by FK866 treatment.",
                                "We observed no signs of toxicity resulting from the treatment with FK866 since the weight of the mice was comparable between placebo- and FK866-treated groups (FIG. 10d). Indeed, FK866 was well tolerated, no premature death occurred in the treated group and the corresponding histopathology of liver, spleen, lung, gut, kidney, inguinal lymph nodes and brain in this group was no different from control animals. In addition, liver toxicity was also ruled out as similar alanine aminotransferase low levels were measured in FK866-treated versus control mice. Finally, hematological examination showed similarity between the treated and control mice (Table 1).",
                                "To verify that FK866-treated mice generated an adequate immune response against type II collagen, total anti-collagen IgG levels were measured by ELISA at the end of the therapy (day 15). No significant difference was observed in anti-collagen IgG levels between control and FK866-treated mice (control mice: 140+/\u221220.2 arbitrary units (n=18), treated mice: 106.5+/\u221217.6 arbitrary units (n=15)). Collectively, these data show that the beneficial effects of FK866 on established CIA were neither due to toxicity nor to impaired immune response to collagen II, but to an impaired secretion of inflammatory cytokines.",

Peritoneal exudates cells (PEC) were obtained by lavage at different time points after treatment, and intracellular NAD levels were determined using an enzymatic assay.
