# DESCRIPTION

The present invention relates to the use of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide for the preparation of a medicament used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The invention relates also to a process to manufacture a medicament for treating inflammatory diseases and finally to a pharmaceutical kit comprising such inhibitor.

The preparation of a class of compounds, comprising several subclasses, which act as inhibitors of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl nucleotide, and their use thereof as anti-tumour agents, is already described in the patent applications WO0050399, WO97/48695, WO97/48397, WO99/31063, WO9931060, WO9931087, WO9931064, WO00/50399, and WO0380054. Especially useful compounds are described in the PCT application WO9748696.

One of these inhibitors, (E)-N-[4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridine-3-yl)-acrylamide also known as APO866, FK866, WK175, or WK22.175 and hereinafter referred to as FK866 [International Non-proprietary Name], is especially described in the literature as an anticancer agent.

FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases implicating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer. It has been demonstrated in the prior art that FK866 interferes with nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide (also known and hereinafter referred to as NAD) biosynthesis and induces apoptotic cell death without any DNA damaging effects.

Antiangiogenic and antitumoral efficacy of FK866 are described in many publications.

The publication “FK866, a high specific non-competitive inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, represents a novel mechanism for induction of tumor cell apoptosis”, M. Hasmann et al., Cancer Research 63, 7436-7442, Nov. 1, 2003 describes more generally FK866 as the first high potent and specific inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and its characteristics as antitumor compound.

For example, its efficacy as antitumor agent for the treatment of leukaemia is described in “WK175, a novel antitumor agent, decreases the intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration and induces the apoptotic cascade in human leukaemia cells”, K. Wosikowski et al., Cancer Research 62, 1057-1062, Feb. 15, 2002.

Its efficacy as antitumor agent for the treatment of renal carcinoma is demonstrated in “antiangiogenic potency of FK866/K22.175, a new inhibitor of intracellular NAD biosyntheses, in murine renal cell carcinoma”, J. Dreves et al., Anticancer Research 23: 4853-4858 (2003).

EP 1 348 434 describes the use of pyridyl amides including FK866 as inhibitors of angiogenesis. According to this document a number of diseases are characterized by unregulated angiogenesis such as inflammatory disorder, proliferative retinopathies, rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration, preneoplastic lesions, benign prostatic hyperplasia, venous neointimal hyperplasia and psoriasis. However, EP 1 348 434 only describes the effect of FK 866 on angiogenesis in a murine renal cell carcinoma. Moreover, it is probable that for most inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, angiogenesis is a consequence, rather than a cause, of inflammation.

Considering the above-mentioned completely different known medical indications of known inhibitors to the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide, the activity of the compounds used according to the invention with advantageous therapeutic properties for inflammatory diseases was completely surprising for the person skilled in the art.

The notion of inflammatory diseases delineates a heterogeneous group of pathologies that involve innate or adaptive immune system components and characterized by chronic inflammation in the absence of infection or seemingly unprovoked. Examples of these diseases are hereditary periodic fevers, Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial mediterranean fever, familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, the metabolic disorders gout and pseudogout, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are cytokines produced by cells of the innate immune system upon microbial activation, and are important mediators of both local and systemic inflammation. In many instances, the secretion of these cytokines is deregulated in inflammatory diseases leading to chronic inflammation.

Inhibition of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 production is beneficial in several inflammatory diseases, and numerous efforts have been devoted in the design of novel therapies aimed at blocking the production and/or the biological effects of these important pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In the present invention, unexpected anti-inflammatory properties of the inhibition of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide have been identified. By inhibiting nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide biosynthesis, it was surprisingly found that TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 secretion are inhibited.

In the present invention, it is demonstrated that optimal proinflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6, require adequate nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide intracellular concentration.

In view of this art, the finding that inhibitors of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide have activities which make them particularly suitable in an excellent manner for the therapy of inflammatory diseases was completely unexpected.

The present invention establishes a functional link between metabolism and inflammation, and demonstrates a potential important role for NAD-dependent enzymes in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, including TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6.

Hence, in a first embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide for the preparation of a medicament used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

In a second embodiment, the present invention relates to a process to manufacture a medicament for treating inflammatory diseases.

In a third embodiment, the present invention also concerns a method of treating inflammatory diseases comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide.

Furthermore, the present invention concerns also a pharmaceutical kit comprising at least an effective amount of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide together with instructions for use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

The term “inhibitor” refers to a substrate molecule that blocks a particular biologic activity.

The expression “competitive inhibitor” refers to a substrate molecule which directly binds to the same active site as the normal enzyme substrate, without undergoing a reaction.

The expression “non-competitive inhibitor” as used herein defines a substrate molecule which always binds to the enzyme at a site other than the enzyme's active site. The binding affects the activity of the enzyme because the presence of the inhibitor causes a change in the structure and shape of the enzyme but it doesn't change the apparent binding affinity of the normal enzyme substrate.

The term “inflammatory diseases” refers to diseases that are characterized by activation of the immune system to abnormal levels that lead to disease.

The terms “rheumatoid arthritis” refer to chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the joints.

The expression “effective amount” generally refers to the quantity for which the active substance has therapeutical effects. In the present case the active substance is the inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide.

“Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase” also named NMPRT, NMPRTase or NAmPRTase, (International nomenclature: E.C. 2.4.2.12) is a key enzyme in nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis from the natural precursor nicotinamide.

“Nicotinic acid” is a precursor of NAD.

In the present invention, both terms “TNF” and “TNF-α” are used to designate the cytokine named “Tumor necrosis factor-α.”.

When used as a therapeutic the inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide described herein are preferably administered with a physiologically acceptable carrier. A physiologically acceptable carrier is a formulation to which the compound can be added to dissolve it or otherwise facilitate its administration. Example of a physiologically acceptable carrier includes propylene glycol. An important factor in choosing an appropriate physiologically acceptable carrier is choosing a carrier in which the compound remains active or the combination of the carrier and the compound produces an active compound.

Benefits of the present invention include oral administration of an optimal amount of a NAD biosynthesis inhibitor.

Based on these results, the present invention has important implications for the design of novel treatment strategies for patients with inflammatory diseases.

Thus, a first aspect of the present invention concerns the use of an inhibitor of the formation of nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide for the preparation of a medicament used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

According to the present invention, the inhibitor is preferably a competitive or noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. According to the present invention, the inhibitor is preferably a compound of formula (I)

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

This example illustrates the direct relationship between NAD levels in cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Human monocytic cell line THP-1 was cultured overnight in the presence of nicotinic acid, a precursor of NAD, and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria for 2 h. The cell supernatant was tested for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) content by ELISA and the intracellular pool of NAD was measured by an enzymatic assay. FIG. 1 shows that TNF secretion and NAD levels were increased in parallel in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of nicotinic acid.

### Example 2

This example describes the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production by the competitive small molecular weight compound inhibitor of NMPRT, ((E)-N-[4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide, designated FK866). Human monocytic cell line THP-1, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, or mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured overnight with increasing doses of FK866, and then stimulated with LPS for 6 h. The culture supernatants were tested for TNF and IL-6 content by ELISA. FIG. 2 shows that FK866 inhibited cytokine secretion in a dose-dependent fashion in all inflammatory cells tested.

### Example 3

This example illustrates that FK866 inhibits TNFα secretion at a posttranscriptional level. The murine RAW 264.7 cell line was incubated in the presence of graded doses of FK866, stimulated with microbial products, and levels of TNFα released in the supernatant evaluated by ELISA. As shown in FIG. 3, FK866 strongly inhibited TNFα secretion in this experimental setting. FK866 did not significantly affect TNFα mRNA levels, showing that intracellular NAD regulates the translational efficiency of TNFα mRNA.

### Example 4

This example describes the inhibition of other pro-inflammatory cytokine production, in addition to TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6, by FK866. Human dendritic cells from 5 different donors were cultured with FK866 before stimulation with LPS or LPS+IFNγ. The culture supernatants were tested for TNFα, IL-12 (p40 and p70), and IL-23 content by ELISA. FIG. 4 shows that FK866 inhibited TNFα (as described in our application) as well as IL-12 and IL-23 production.

### Example 5

This example illustrates the correlation between proinflammatory cytokine secretion and NAD levels in the cell. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was cultured overnight with increasing doses of FK866, and then stimulated with LPS for 2 h. The culture supernatants were tested for TNF content by ELISA and intracellular NAD levels were measured by an enzymatic assay. FIG. 5A shows that inhibition of TNF production correlated with the inhibition of intracellular NAD levels.

In another experiment, RAW264.7 cells were cultured overnight in the presence of FK866 and the intracellular pool of NAD was restored by co-incubation of the cells with nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is a precursor of NAD, but its transformation into NAD is not dependent upon NMPRT and is thus not inhibited by FK866. Cells were then stimulated with LPS for 2 h and the culture supernatant was tested for TNF content by ELISA. FIG. 5B shows that addition of nicotinic acid maintained high levels of NAD, even in the presence of FK866. The synthesis of TNF was also restored showing the direct relationship between NAD levels in cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.

In another experiment, RAW264.7 cells were cultured overnight in the presence of FK866 and NAD levels were maintained by culturing the cells in the presence: of extra-cellular NAD. Cells were then stimulated with LPS for 2 h and the culture supernatant was tested for TNF content by ELISA. FIG. 5C shows that NAD levels remained high even in the presence of FK866, and TNF synthesis was restored.

### Example 6

This example illustrates that the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine secretion induced by lowering intracellular NAD levels is not due to apoptosis induction. Human PBMC were isolated and cultured overnight with increasing doses of FK866, and then stimulated with LPS for 6 h. At the end of the culture, cell viability was assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. FIG. 6A shows that cell viability was not affected by FK866.

In another experiment, human monocyte-derived dendritic cells were isolated and cultured overnight with increasing doses of FK866, and then stimulated with LPS for 6 h. At the end of the culture, the survival of cells was measured by Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining and no difference in survival was observed in cells treated with FK866 compared to untreated cells (FIG. 6B). This shows that inhibition of NAD and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was not simply due to cell death induction.

### Example 7

This example illustrates that NAMPT is the only molecular target of FK866. The human THP-1 monocytic cell line was cultured in the presence of medium or FK866 and stimulated by LPS. Addition of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the product of the NAMPT-catalyzed reaction, restored both intracellular NAD levels and TNFα production, despite continuous exposure to FK866 (FIG. 7). The underlying mechanism by which NMN exerts its effect is linked to NAD generation via the conversion of NMN to NAD, catalyzed by NMNAT. These results confirm both the specificity of action of FK866 and the role of intracellular NAD in regulating TNFα secretion.

### Example 8

This example describes the reduction of disease severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an experimental mouse model of collagen-induced RA after treatment with FK866. RA is an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints leading to their destruction. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role in the development and maintenance of the disease, and blocking of TNF or IL-1 for alleviating symptoms of RA is now well established in clinical practice. Male DBA/1 mice between 8-10 weeks of were immunized intradermally at the base of tail with 100 μg of native type II collagen (CII), emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 5 mg/ml mycobacterium tuberculosis. Twenty-one days later, the mice were boosted with 100 μg collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant intradermally at the base of the tail. From day 15 after the first immunization onward, mice are examined daily for the onset of clinical arthritis. The severity of arthritis is scored on a 3-point scale, where 0=normal appearance, 1=mild swelling and/or erythema, 2=pronounced swelling and erythema, and 3=joint rigidity. Each limb is graded, resulting in a maximal clinical score of 12 per animal. Treatment with FK866 was administered twice daily at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally for a total of 15 days from the day when CIA became clinically detectable (clinical scoring≧1). Results shown in FIG. 8 indicate that FK866 ameliorates the symptoms of arthritis in an animal model of RA.

### Example 9

This example describes that FK866-targeted enzyme NAMPT expression is upregulated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). During CIA, the level of NAMPT was significantly elevated in sera and paw tissue extracts from arthritic mice compared to non-arthritic naïve controls as measured by ELISA (FIGS. 9a and b, respectively). These results were also supported by NAMPT immunohistochemistry. Indeed, we found massive staining of arthritic paw and knee joints from CIA, but markedly reduced staining in non-arthritic joints or joints from naïve mice. In affected joints, NAMPT staining was prominent in synoviocytes of the synovial lining layer (SLL), sub-intimal synovium and pannus (P) and in some inflammatory cells. Most of the blood vessels were also positive. In addition, some positive chondrocytes were observed in both normal and arthritic joints.

**Example 10**

This example illustrates that NAMPT inhibition with FK866 reduces established collagen-induced arthritis. FK866 was administered from the day following the appearance of the first clinical symptoms of arthritis, and continued for 15 days. FK866 had a marked protective dose-dependent effect on CIA, with a maximal therapeutic effect when administered at 10 mg/kg (FIG. 10a). The beneficial effect was apparent within 10 days following the commencement of treatment, and with an activity similar to etanercept (anti-TNFα treatment) (FIG. 10b). To gain more insight into the inhibitory mechanism of action of FK866 on CIA, we repeated the CIA curative experiment using the optimal dose of FK866 and analyzed more parameters. Paws from FK866-treated mice showed minimal signs of inflammation after 2 weeks of treatment whereas paws from placebo-treated mice were still inflamed, and this was also reflected in the clinical scoring. Additionally, these in vivo clinical observations were consistent with histology of knees and paws, where much less inflammation was observed in the FK866-treated group. Knee joints of placebo mice and mice treated with FK866 were assessed for inflammatory infiltrate and synovial hyperplasia. Histological sections revealed a statistically significant decrease in inflammatory infiltrate and hyperplasia in mice treated with FK866 as compared to placebo-treated controls. Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) levels, which reflect the systemic inflammatory response, were decreased in FK866-treated mice (FIG. 10c), further suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of FK866 administration. Amongst the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the amelioration of CIA by FK866 is the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Expression of different cytokines was investigated in paw tissue extracts at the end of the experiment. TNFα was below the level of detection of the assay Locally produced IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly reduced in FK866-treated animals. MCP-1 was decreased, and finally IL-10 secretion remained unchanged by FK866 treatment.

We observed no signs of toxicity resulting from the treatment with FK866 since the weight of the mice was comparable between placebo- and FK866-treated groups (FIG. 10d). Indeed, FK866 was well tolerated, no premature death occurred in the treated group and the corresponding histopathology of liver, spleen, lung, gut, kidney, inguinal lymph nodes and brain in this group was no different from control animals. In addition, liver toxicity was also ruled out as similar alanine aminotransferase low levels were measured in FK866-treated versus control mice. Finally, hematological examination showed similarity between the treated and control mice (Table 1).

To verify that FK866-treated mice generated an adequate immune response against type II collagen, total anti-collagen IgG levels were measured by ELISA at the end of the therapy (day 15). No significant difference was observed in anti-collagen IgG levels between control and FK866-treated mice (control mice: 140+/−20.2 arbitrary units (n=18), treated mice: 106.5+/−17.6 arbitrary units (n=15)). Collectively, these data show that the beneficial effects of FK866 on established CIA were neither due to toxicity nor to impaired immune response to collagen II, but to an impaired secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

**Example 11**

This example illustrates that FK866 reduces intracellular NAD level in inflammatory cells in vivo. Naïve mice were treated ip with thioglycollate to elicit inflammatory cells, and then FK866 was administered ip at 10 mg/kg. Peritoneal exudates cells (PEC) were obtained by lavage at different time points after treatment, and intracellular NAD levels were determined using an enzymatic assay. FIG. 11 shows that FK866 induced a significant time-dependent NAD depletion in macrophages in vivo with a nadir at 9 h and recovery around 14 h after injection.

**Example 12**

This example illustrates that NAMPT inhibition reduces circulating TNFα during endotoxemia and correlates with diminished intracellular NAD in inflammatory cells. Naïve mice were treated ip with thioglycollate to elicit inflammatory cells, and then were treated ip with placebo or 10 mg/kg FK866 7 h before an intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Mice were bled 90 min later for evaluation of serum TNFα levels. As shown in FIG. 12, FK866 induced a significant decrease in circulating TNFα levels compared to placebo. This decrease in TNFα secretion was accompanied by a significant decrease in intracellular NAD in PECs obtained from the same mice.
