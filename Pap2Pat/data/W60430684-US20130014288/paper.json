    "title": "Pharmacological Rescue of the Mutant Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Detected by Use of a Novel Fluorescence Platform",
    "date": "2012-02-29",
    "abstract": "Numerous human diseases arise because of defects in protein folding, leading to their degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Among them is cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR ), an epithelial anion channel. The most common mutation, F508del, disrupts CFTR folding, which blocks its trafficking to the plasma membrane. We developed a fluorescence detection platform using fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) to directly detect FAP-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface using a cell-impermeant probe. By using this approach, we determined the efficacy of new corrector compounds, both alone and in combination, to rescue F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane. Combinations of correctors produced additive or synergistic effects, improving the density of mutant CFTR at the cell surface up to ninefold over a single-compound treatment. The results correlated closely with assays of stimulated anion transport performed in polarized human bronchial epithelia that endogenously express F508del-CFTR. These findings indicate that the FAP-tagged constructs faithfully report mutant CFTR correction activity and that this approach should be useful as a screening assay in diseases that impair protein trafficking to the cell surface.",

                "Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (1). CFTR is an anion channel that is responsible for adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-stimulated secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions across the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells (2). CFTR is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of two membrane-spanning domains, each composed of six membrane-spanning \u03b1-he-lices, two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBD) and a central cytoplasmic regulatory domain, the predominant site of PKA phosphorylation (3). Although there are many documented mutations in CFTR, by far the most prevalent mutation, the deletion of F508 in NBD1 (F508del) is present on at least one allele in 90% of CF patients (4). This mutation causes protein misfolding that results in premature proteasomal degradation, and it precludes channel expression at the cell surface (5,6). The trafficking of F508del-CFTR to the plasma membrane can be partially rescued, however, by low temperature (<30\u00b0C) or with chemical chaperones such as glycerol (6)(7)(8).",
                "Recent efforts are aimed at the discovery of small molecules that remedy the folding of mutant CFTR and promote its trafficking to the plasma membrane. High-throughput drug screening efforts have successfully identified many small molecule compounds that partially rescue the trafficking defect of F508del-CFTR, called correctors (9)(10)(11)(12). Thus far, correctors have shown limited ability to improve F508del-CFTR trafficking. Even after corrector treatment, F508del-CFTR has <15% the activity of CFTR wild-type (WT), and the corrector efficacy may vary depending on the cell type examined (13)(14)(15)(16). More robust rescue can be achieved by using a combination of correctors, which enhances rescue to levels greater than individual compound actions (17)(18)(19).",
                "To date, most F508del-CFTR corrector high-throughput screening assays have relied on measurements of restored CFTR function. Halide sensitive yellow fluorescent proteins or F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based voltagesensitive membrane dyes have been used to detect plasma membrane F508del-CFTR function after small molecule treatment on the basis of detection of stimulated anion efflux from preloaded cells (13,14). Both of these methods require multiple wash steps and are susceptible to signal saturation. In addition, they rely on the recruitment of a functional CFTR to the cell surface. Alternatively, an immunofluorescence labeling method has been used with an epitope tagged version of CFTR to detect trafficking of mutant CFTR to the cell surface (20). This antibody-labeling approach also required multiple wash and binding steps, which add variability, reduce throughput for drug screening and can introduce artifacts due to cell permeabilization. Direct detection of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface with a single labeling step would improve throughput and increase the dynamic range of corrector screening assays.",
                "Selective and sensitive detection of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface can be used to identify new correctors and can elucidate mechanisms for existing ones. However, this approach normally requires labor-intensive biochemical methods, such as immunofluorescence using epitope tags or biotinylation and subsequent immunoblotting techniques (21)(22)(23). To address these limitations, we tagged CFTR with a protein module that provides a unique and selective fluorescence assay of the abundance of this protein at the cell surface. The protein tag is comprised of a genetically encoded fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) that has been fused to the N-terminus or inserted in the fourth extracellular loop (EL4) of CFTR.",
                "Here, we report the development of the FAP-CFTR platform and found the behavior as well as functional activity consistent with that of untagged WT and F508del-CFTR. Importantly, F508del-CFTR FAP constructs provide a method to quantify corrector efficacy that was consistent with functional measurements of endogenous untagged CFTR in a native airway cell background. Using this method, we characterized two new correctors, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics (CFFT)-002 and C18, as well as corrector combinations that significantly improve the trafficking of F508del-CFTR compared with the previously described C4 corrector. Furthermore, this platform has a modular design to allow for rapid construction of FAP fusions with most transmembrane proteins. Therefore, this development can serve as a template for application to other protein trafficking diseases, to accelerate the discovery of pharmacological agents that rescue trafficking defects."

                        "The FAP system consists of a genetically encodable engineered antibody fragment (scFv) that binds a small organic dye called a \"fluorogen.\" The fluorogen is completely nonfluorescent in solution, but on binding to the FAP, its fluorescence activity is increased dramatically (15,000-20,000-fold) (25). The bipartite FAP and cognate fluorogen system enables the selective visualization of proteins at the cell surface through the use of a cellimpermeant fluorogen, MG, fused to an 11-unit polyethylene glycol linker (MG-11p). Alternatively, the total cellular distribution of FAP-tagged protein can be visualized using MG-ester, a fluorogen that passively diffuses across the cell membrane and is then trapped within the cell.",
                        "To use FAP-based detection for CFTR, we generated two separate CFTR tagging strategies, each of which presents the FAP tag to the extracellular environment, where it is accessible to the cell-impermeant fluorogen. First, we modified the N-terminus to include the FAP and an additional transmembrane segment, derived from the PDGF receptor; this is called FAP-CFTR (24). Second, we inserted the FAP tag into the fourth extracellular loop of CFTR, to generate CFTR EL4-FAP (Figure 1). EL4 is the largest extracellular domain in CFTR and has been used previously to insert epitope tags and fluorescent proteins (26)(27)(28). Because CFTR had been found to tolerate these modifications while retaining functional activity, we chose this location to create an FAP-CFTR chimeric protein. The CFTR EL4-FAP chimera was generated by inserting the FAP in the EL4 between the two asparagine residues required for the posttranslational glycosylation of CFTR (29,30).",
                        "To verify that the FAP reporter constructs behaved as expected, we expressed them in HEK293 cells and used the cell-impermeant fluorogen, MG-11p, to ask whether tagged WT CFTR had progressed to the cell surface. These cells were imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy in the presence of either cellimpermeant or cell-permeant fluorogen, and representative images are provided in Figure 2. Distinct labeling of the cell membrane was observed with MG-11p (Figures 2A,C), which indicates that the CFTR WT FAP fusion proteins are trafficked to, and inserted in, the plasma membrane, exposing the FAP to the ex-tracellular environment. When the same cells were exposed to MG-ester, there was a small, yet detectable, additional intracellular pool of protein, but the signal was predominantly localized to the cell surface (Figures 2B,D)."

HEK293 cells stably expressing ei-ther the N-terminal or EL4 FAP F508del-CFTR constructs were grown under control conditions (vehicle, DMSO) for 24 h and imaged with MG-11p by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As expected, there was no signal because of the added fluorogen. The F508del-CFTR mutation prevented trafficking of the protein to the cell surface and presentation of FAP at the plasma membrane (Figures 3A,D). Consequently, the FAP is not exposed to the extracellular environment and is unable to bind and activate the cell-excluded MG-11p fluorogen. These images illustrate the low background level obtained from this technology, which can provide a large dynamic range for surface protein detection. To verify fusion protein expression under normal conditions, these cells were incubated with the cell-permeant fluorogen, MG-ester, which produced a significant intracellular expression pattern (Figures 3B,E). These observations are consistent with the trafficking defect of untagged F508del-CFTR, since the protein is translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but translocation to and beyond the Golgi is blocked.",

In contrast to the vehicle-treated control, both the Nterminal and the EL4 F508del-CFTR-expressing cell lines showed activation of the cell-impermeant fluorogen.

SPQ is quenched by iodide, so that the signal is weak in iodide-preloaded cells. Replacement of medium iodide with nitrate, which does not interact with SPQ, leads to dequenching of the signal in cells expressing functional CFTR at the plasma membrane upon treatment with forskolin. Using this approach, we found that both the HEK293 cells expressing the N-terminus or EL4 FAP tagged CFTR WT constructs displayed a characteristic pattern of CFTR-mediated iodide efflux in response to forskolin stimulation (Figure 5A). Both the N-terminus and EL4 reporter constructs produced a rapid increase in SPQ fluorescence, which was consistent with that observed for untagged CFTR WT. Therefore, the cAMPstimulated anion transport activity of CFTR is maintained with the FAP reporter modifications.",

To test whether the rescue of F508del-CFTR FAP trafficking results in the production of functional channels, we examined anion efflux in both cell lines after treatment with C4 and C18 correctors for 24 h. The corrector-treated cells generated substantial iodide efflux in response to stimulation that was completely absent in the vehicletreated control groups (Figures 5B,C).",

The maturation of WT CFTR can be visualized as two bands on an SDS-PAGE gel: a more mobile core glycosylated form, having modifications acquired in the endoplasmic reticulum (B band), and a less mobile mature, complex glycosylated form, produced when the protein traverses the Golgi compartment (C band). Consistent with untagged WT  CFTR, FAP-CFTR WT migrated as two distinct bands, which we interpret as the core and mature (B and C, respectively) forms (Figure 6A), with increases in molecular weight attributed to the addition of the FAP tag (~20 kDa). On the other hand, CFTR WT EL4-FAP did not exhibit distinct B and C bands (see Figure 6A). Although a larger migrating band was present above the core glycosylated form, it did not show a discrete molecular weight shift expected from Golgi maturation.",
                        "Native F508del-CFTR does not produce a mature glycosylated band because it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded before export to the Golgi. Previous studies have shown that correctors promote the maturation of F508del-CFTR, which can be visualized by the appearance of band C (13,14). To test whether the F508del-CFTR FAP reporter proteins also exhibit this behavior, we performed immunoblots using the CFTR-specific antibody, CFFT#596. Whole cell lysates from stable HEK293 cell lines expressing either the FAP-F508del-CFTR or the F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP were extracted from cells that had been treated with correctors or vehicle (DMSO). FAP-F508del-CFTR acquired a band that migrated at the same position as the C band of FAP-CFTR WT after corrector  HEK293 cells expressing either untagged or FAP-CFTR constructs. F508del constructs receiving treatment with correctors CFFT-002 + C18 or C4 + C18 for 24 h showed an accumulation of higher-molecular weight bands that were not present in the vehicle-treated control. FAP-F508del-CFTR corrected lanes have acquired a fully glycosylated C band, but corrected F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP shows incomplete glycosylation. (B) HBE cells expressing untagged F508del were treated with CFFT-002 and C18 either alone or in combination.

Like FAP-CFTR WT, F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP acquired higher molecular weight bands after both corrector treatments (CFFT-002 + C18), which were absent under control conditions (see Figure 6A). Complete glycosylation was not achieved for the F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP relative to the N-terminal FAP tag, even after corrector treatment, an observation that is consistent also for CFTR WT EL4-FAP. In HBE cells, which express endogenous untagged CFTR F508del, rescue of a mature glycosylated band was detected after treatment with a combination of CFFT-002 and C18, and at a lower density after treatment with C18 alone, and was not evident under control conditions or after CFFT-002 (Figure 6B). Densitometry plots of each of the lanes from these immunoblots were generated to facilitate detection and interpretation of antibody labeling (Figure 6C)."

Flow cytometry offers a quantitative output of the fluorescence of each cell, while also providing information on the distribution of fluorescence across a large cell population. We analyzed 10,000 cells per condition and took the average fluorescence intensity from activation of the MG-11p signal, which reduced the effects of heterogeneity between cells due to expression differences and other factors such as cell cycle. HEK293 cell lines expressing either FAP-F508del-CFTR or F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP were incubated with single correctors or combinations of correctors at their maximal effective concentrations for 24 h. After corrector treatment, the cells were brought into suspension using a nonenzymatic reagent to ensure that proteins at the cell surface remained intact, an issue that complicates enzymatic procedures such as trypsinization. Samples were analyzed in the presence of cell-impermeant fluorogen, MG-11p, and the fluorescence activation across the population over three independent trials was normalized to the signal obtained for C18 (see Table 1 for a summary of corrector efficacy data). A representative output of these experiments is shown in Figure 7A. C18 + CFFT-002 treatment produced a dramatic increase in signal in the FAP-F508del-CFTR samples and a lesser increase in the F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP samples.",

A statistically significant difference was found for FAP-F508del-CFTR when treated with C4 but not for F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP.

Levels of trafficking correction reached 3.5-fold better than observed for the reference corrector, C4, for the N-terminus tagged F508del-CFTR construct after subtraction of the vehicle (DMSO) control.",

A combination of CFFT-002 and C18, however, resulted in a significant increase in surface expression, resulting in an 8.6fold increase over the rescue achieved by C4 alone. Similarly, C4 and C18 treatment produced a 9.3-fold improvement compared with C4 correction. There was no statistically significant difference found for the CFFT-002 + C18 versus C4 + C18 corrector conditions.

Therefore, this system can provide a reference for evaluating the potential of the FAP approach as a screen for drug discovery or development.

The combination of CFFT-002 and C18, but not C4 and the other correctors, increased the extent of functional rescue compared with these compounds when used individually.

                "Selective detection of proteins at the cell surface is a prerequisite for studying the trafficking behavior of membrane proteins, such as CFTR, to and from the plasma membrane and for evaluating therapeutic approaches to diseases of protein folding. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by time-and laborintensive biochemical labeling methods such as biotinylation and immunofluorescence. By using a genetically encoded FAP reporter, however, we can selectively label CFTR at the cell surface in live cells instantly without the need for incubation or wash steps that may modify the cellular handling of CFTR. The cell-impermeant fluorogen remains dark when free in solution; however, upon binding to the FAP, fluorogen fluorescence increases >15,000-fold. These features provide low background signal, excellent signal-to-noise and a large dynamic range, and they eliminate the need for wash or blocking steps to remove nonspecific signals. Proper trafficking and localization of FAP-tagged CFTR to the cell surface was confirmed using confocal fluorescence microscopy in stable cell lines. Importantly, F508del-CFTR FAP protein was absent from the plasma membrane under normal conditions, but was readily detected by cell-impermeant fluorogen after treatment by currently available correctors.",
                "Immunoblot analysis was used to reveal the glycosylation state of the FAP-CFTR WT and CFTR WT EL4-FAP fusion constructs. The N-terminal FAP-CFTR WT fusion protein migrated as two distinct bands, the core and mature bands characteristic of untagged CFTR WT. The CFTR EL4-FAP construct did not produce a distinct mature band, which suggests that the efficiency of its glycosylation was impaired. The fourth extracellular loop of CFTR is the locus of two asparagine residues (N894 and N900) that acquire N-linked glycosylation and other modifications; therefore, careful consideration was taken to preserve these residues, and the consensus glycosylation sequences (NXS/T) surrounding them, in the FAP fusion construct (29,30). The observed incomplete glycosylation could be due to reduced glycan modification or partial oligosaccharide modification at these sites, which may result from impaired glycosylation enzyme recognition and/or accessibility at these sites when the FAP tag is pres-ent. Modification of the FAP location within EL4 or by varying the spacer length and/or properties may improve glycosylation. However, in view of the adequacy of the N-terminal reporter, this step has not been pursued.",
                "Importantly, immunoblots showed that corrector treatment was capable of rescuing the maturation of FAP-F508del-CFTR, albeit modestly (Figure 6). Accumulation of the C band after corrector treatment is quite low with untagged F508del-CFTR and can depend on the cell type examined (13,15). To date, C4 is one of the most well-studied correctors for F508del-CFTR rescue. However, the efficiency of rescue for C4 is quite limited across multiple cell types that have been tested (15,18,32). This result is in agreement with data obtained from both F508del-CFTR FAP constructs in HEK293 cells as well as the currents associated with F508del-CFTR endogenously expressed from HBE cells, where functional C4 correction efficacy was poor (Table 1). Unlike C4, C18 displayed a more robust rescue in both HEK293 cells expressing FAP-CFTR constructs and in HBE cells expressing endogenous F508del-CFTR. Because rescue by C18 was independent of cellular background, this molecule may interact directly with F508del-CFTR or through a common quality control pathway expressed in both systems. Future studies to determine the exact mechanism of these correctors, especially C18 and related compounds, will increase our understanding of the F508del-CFTR folding defect and can help guide the design of new and more effective correctors or corrector combinations.",
                "Combinations of corrector treatments, particularly CFFT-002 and C18, improved F508del-CFTR trafficking and function over single corrector treatments alone (Table 1). The enhanced effects produced from combinations of correctors, acting at their maximally effective concentrations, indicate that these corrector compounds likely have distinct targets and/or mechanisms of action. One possibility is that each corrector interacts with a different structural feature of F508del-CFTR to sta-bilize their folding or reduce nonproductive folding intermediates. Because the folding defect of F508del involves multiple domain and interdomain interactions, multiple interaction sites may be necessary for optimal correction of the misfolded protein (33)(34)(35)(36)(37). Alternatively, rescue might be achieved indirectly through the modulation of folding chaperones or by suppressing ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathways that promote F508del-CFTR ubiquitylation and degradation. In addition, since rescued F508del-CFTR may also be subject to quality control pathways at the cell surface, rescue improvements may arise via actions at different cell loci (28,38). Because the development of combination therapies to correct CFTR trafficking may be required to obtain sufficient efficacy, the availability of a method with a broad dynamic range should optimize the detection of a signal that approaches that of WT CFTR.",
                "Alternative tagging strategies were used to study CFTR to minimize artifacts due to the fluorescent reporter position. Although, the N-terminus and EL4 constructs both produced functional CFTR fusion proteins for which behavior was qualitatively similar, there were some important differences between them. In addition to the impaired glycosylation of the EL4 constructs, the plasma membrane density and anion transport of F508del-CFTR EL4-FAP, even after corrector treatment, was substantially diminished compared with the N-terminal fusion. Therefore, the N-terminal fusion appears to be superior because of its more robust expression, glycosylation state and anion transport capabilities.",
                "The pattern of corrector efficacy was strikingly similar across the disparate cell types and assays that we examined, and this has not always been observed (15,16). Nevertheless, our results highlight the fidelity of the FAP reporter system to recapitulate the behavior of F508del-CFTR in a system that expresses the mutant untagged protein endogenously. Taken together, these re-sults demonstrate that the FAP reporter system is sensitive enough to elucidate differences in the extent of correction of cell surface expression among different correctors. Moreover, this pattern of corrector action correlates with functional data obtained from differentiated human airway epithelia, a drug development system that has enabled the transition from preclinical data to clinical trials (39,40)."

As a proof of principle, this system has been validated with known corrector compounds, but could be adapted to a multi-well format to screen for new correctors. Therefore, this fluorescence-based approach could streamline the current drug development pipeline.
