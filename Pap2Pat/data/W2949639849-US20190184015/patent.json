    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an approach for the treatment of adverse neurological sensations in a certain body surface area such as the skin, in particular treatment of pain or itching. The invention is based on the finding that administration of a targeting molecule which specifically binds a cell or receptor responsible for the adverse sensation in the respective body surface area of a patient, and which is coupled/conjugated to a photosensitive inhibitor or cytotoxic agent can enable the irradiation dependent ablation of cells responsible for the sensation. This approach allows a targeted and specific treatment of body surface areas by irradiation. Provided are conjugate compounds for use in the photoablation treatment of the invention and pharmaceutical compositions which comprise these compounds.",

                        "Itch is a cutaneous sensory perception defined by the behavioral response it elicits: an urgent need to scratch (A. Ikoma, M. Steinhoff, S. Stander, G. Yosipovitch, M. Schmelz, The neurobiology of itch. Nat Rev Neurosci 7, 535-547 (2006)). When itching becomes pathological, it can be irritating and distressful and have a dramatic impact on quality of life (S. Davidson, G. J. Giesler, The multiple pathways for itch and their interactions with pain. Trends Neurosci 33, 550-558 (2010)). Chronic itch generates a recurrent cycle whereby the more the skin is scratched, the more it itches (C. F. Wahlgren, Itch and atopic dermatitis: an overview. J Dermatol 26, 770-779 (1999)). In turn, this may lead to serious damage to the skin barrier and thereby an increased risk of infection. There are many itch-associated diseases such as atopic dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis that respond poorly to current therapies (S. B. Elmariah, E. A. Lerner, Topical therapies for pruritus. Semin Cutan Med Surg 30, 118-126 (2011)). Identifying novel strategies to reduce itching is therefore critical and requires a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.",
                        "Although several key molecules involved in transducing itch sensation have recently been described, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive chronic itch are not fully understood. The transduction of itch begins in the skin where a network of different cell types, such as keratinocytes, sensory nerves and immune cells respond to exogenous or endogenous pruritogens and initiate the cascade which ends with the scratch response (D. M. Bautista, S. R. Wilson, M. A. Hoon, Why we scratch an itch: the molecules, cells and circuits of itch. Nat Neurosci 17, 175-182 (2014)). Two major itch pathways have been described; the histaminergic pathway which is mediated by histamine (K. Rossbach et al., Histamine H1, H3 and H4 receptors are involved in pruritus. Neuroscience 190, 89-102 (2011)), and the non-histaminergic pathway which includes other itch mediators, such as chloroquine and inflammatory cytokines (Q. Liu et al., Sensory neuron-specific GPCR Mrgprs are itch receptors mediating chloroquine-induced pruritus. Cell 139, 1353-1365 (2009)). It is becoming increasingly apparent that anti-histaminergic drugs are often ineffective against many chronic itch conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (A. Reich, J. C. Szepietowski, Mediators of pruritus in psoriasis. Mediators Inflamm 2007, 64727 (2007), and N. Takano, I. Arai, Y. Hashimoto, M. Kurachi, Evaluation of antipruritic effects of several agents on scratching behavior by NC/Nga mice. Eur J Pharmacol 495, 159-165 (2004)). Attention has now turned to non-histaminergic pathways to control itch sensation under pathological conditions (M. Steinhoff et al., Neurophysiological, neuroimmunological, and neuroendocrine basis of pruritus. J Invest Dermatol 126, 1705-1718 (2006)).",
                        "Amongst anti-histamine resistant itch mediators, the cytokine Interleukin 31 (IL-31) has recently attracted much attention as a novel target molecule for chronic itch therapy (S. R. Dillon et al., Interleukin 31, a cytokine produced by activated T cells, induces dermatitis in mice. Nat Immunol 5, 752-760 (2004)). IL-31 is a four-helix bundle cytokine with a prominent skin tropism that is produced preferentially by T helper-type 2 cells (O. Grimstad et al., Anti-interleukin-31-antibodies ameliorate scratching behaviour in NC/Nga mice: a model of atopic dermatitis. Exp Dermatol 18, 35-43 (2009)). It signals through a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL31RA and OSMR which are expressed in epithelial cells, keratinocytes and sensory neurons (Bando, Y. Morikawa, T. Komori, E. Senba, Complete overlap of interleukin-31 receptor A and oncostatin M receptor beta in the adult dorsal root ganglia with distinct developmental expression patterns. Neuroscience 142, 1263-1271 (2006), and C. Diveu et al., Predominant expression of the long isoform of GP130-like (GPL) receptor is required for interleukin-31 signaling. Eur Cytokine Netw 15, 291-302 (2004)). Transgenic mice overexpressing IL-31 develop severe pruritus, alopecia and skin lesions that resemble lesioned skin from patients with atopic dermatitis. Moreover, numerous studies have reported an association of IL-31 with inflammatory skin diseases with a severe pruritic component. For example, IL-31 mRNA is up-regulated in human patients with atopic dermatitis (E. Sonkoly et al., IL-31: a new link between T cells and pruritus in atopic skin inflammation. J Allergy Clin Immunol 117, 411-417 (2006)) and in mouse models of this disease (A. Takaoka et al., Expression of IL-31 gene transcripts in NC/Nga mice with atopic dermatitis. Eur J Pharmacol 516, 180-181 (2005)). Furthermore, a common IL31 haplotype has been associated with non-atopic eczema in three independent European populations, marking this as the first genetic risk factor for non-atopic eczema (F. Schulz et al., A common haplotype of the IL-31 gene influencing gene expression is associated with nonatopic eczema. J Allergy Clin Immunol 120, 1097-1102 (2007)). Intriguingly, it has been suggested that the major pathology evoked by IL-31 is to induce pruritus, rather than directly causing skin lesions per se (Q. Zhang, P. Putheti, Q. Zhou, Q. Liu, W. Gao, Structures and biological functions of IL-31 and IL-31 receptors. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 19, 347-356 (2008)). Thus therapies which reduce scratching and break the cycle of itch and disruption of the skin's barrier function (M. W. Greaves, N. Khalifa, Itch: more than skin deep. International archives of allergy and immunology 135, 166-172 (2004)) may be the most effective strategies for improving the quality of life for patients with chronic pruritic disease.",
                        "Another neurological sensation covered by the invention is pain. The treatment of pain conditions is of great importance in medicine. There is currently a world-wide need for additional pain therapy. The pressing requirement for a specific treatment of pain conditions or as well a treatment of specific pain conditions which is right for the patient, which is to be understood as the successful and satisfactory treatment of pain for the patients, is documented in the large number of scientific works which have recently and over the years appeared in the field of applied analgesics or on basic research on nociception. PAIN is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as \u201can unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage\u201d (IASP, Classification of chronic pain, 2nd Edition, IASP Press (2002), 210). Even though pain is always subjective its causes or syndromes can be classified.",
                        "In neuropathic pain patients, hypersensitivity to light touch can develop to the extent that movement of a single hair shaft is sufficient to provoke severe pain. This impacts greatly upon quality of life due to the pervasive nature of mechanical stimuli (mechanical allodynia); for example, small movements of the body, or the weight of clothing can cause severe pain in neuropathic patients. While much recent progress has been made in delineating the spinal circuits that gate mechanical pain, however the sensory neurons that input this sensation into the spinal cord are not known.",
                        "Especially mechanical allodynia which in the past years has developed into a major health problem in broad areas of the population needs a very specific treatment, especially considering that any treatment of mechanical allodynia is extremely sensitive to the causes behind the pain, be it the disease ultimately causing it or the mechanistic pathway over which it develops.",
                        "Hypothetically, mechanical hypersensitivity could be mediated either by sensitization of nociceptors, or through integration of input from low threshold mechanoreceptors into pain transmitting circuits. In human studies, there is little evidence for nociceptor sensitization, and most reports indicate that mechanical allodynia is conveyed by myelinated A-fibre mechanoreceptors. For example, differential block of these nerves alleviates brush evoked pain, and the short latency of pain perception is indicative of the fast conduction velocity of A-fibres. Similarly, in experimental animal studies it has been demonstrated that mice develop mechanical allodynia in neuropathic pain models even when all nociceptors are genetically ablated. Unmyelinated C-low threshold mechanoreceptors marked by Vglut3 expression were initially proposed as a candidate population for driving mechanical hypersensitivity. However, allodynia persists even when these neurons fail to develop, and recent evidence indicates that transient Vglut3 expression in spinal interneurons accounts for the phenotype. Thus a subtype of A-fibre mechanoreceptor is likely the input that drives pain sensation from innocuous touch stimulation.",
                        "Therefore, it was the underlying problem of this invention to develop a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of adverse neurological sensations in body surface areas such as parts of the skin which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks exemplified for the treatment of itch and pain.",
                        "In a first aspect of the invention, the above problem is solved by a method for targeting and inhibiting/killing a target cell in a target body surface area of a subject, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n\n- - (a) Providing a conjugate compound, preferably a protein conjugate\n    compound, comprising (i) a binding domain which specifically binds\n    to the target cell, and (ii) a photosensitive inhibition/cytotoxin\n    group,\n  - (b) Administering said conjugate compound to the subject, and\n  - (c) Irradiating said target body surface area of the subject with an\n    appropriate excitation light in an amount to effectively activate\n    said photosensitive inhibition/cytotoxin group and to induce\n    cellular inhibition or cell death of the target cell.",
                        "In some embodiments it is preferred that the administration of the conjugate compound to the subject results in a sufficient final concentration of the conjugate compound in the respective target body surface area of the subject.",
                        "In certain aspects the invention pertains to the above noted conjugate compound for use in such a method, or alternatively for use in the treatment of neurological sensations in a body surface area. Preferably, the neurological sensation is selected from noxious or innocuous stimuli, such as all forms of mechanical (touch) sensation, pain and/or itching. Preferred is in some embodiments that the neurological sensation is a sensation other than pain, such as itch.",
                        "Preferably, in some embodiments, the method for targeting and inhibiting/killing a target cell in a target body surface area of a subject is a method for treating a neurological sensation in said subject. In this case the target cell is a cell mediating, or being involved in, the pathology or manifestation of said neurological sensation. Further, the target body surface area is an area in which the subject perceives, feels, experiences or otherwise senses (locally) said neurological sensation, or parts of it. In some embodiments of the invention the target cell is a (for example peripheral) sensory neuron(s), preferably expressing Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) or alternatively IL31RA and/or Oncostatin-M specific receptor (OSMR).",

It may also be present independently of a disease, disease state, or disorder. The term \u201citch\u201d or \u201cpruritus\u201d includes itch, or pruritus, wherein the cause of the itch or pruritus is associated with or due to a disorder, disease or disease state, and includes itch or pruritus wherein the cause or origin is not understood. \u201cItch related disorder or disease\u201d is known in the field. The term \u201citch related disorder or disease\u201d means itch associated with or due to a disorder or disease.

Within the context of the present invention, the term \u201cpain\u201d as used herein refers to a pain state experienced by a human individual or a mammal (also referred to as a \u201csubject!\u201d or \u201cpatient\u201d herein) that includes a non-nociceptive pain, i.e., a neuropathic pain, a sympathetic pain, or both. As used herein, the term \u201cpain\u201d is also intended to include a mixed pain syndrome that includes a nociceptive pain state in addition to a non-nociceptive pain state. As used herein, the term \u201cneuropathic pain\u201d is a common type of chronic, non-malignant pain, which is the result of an injury or malfunction in the peripheral or central nervous system and serves no protective biological function. It may occur, for example, due to trauma, surgery, herniation of an intervertebral disk, spinal cord injury, diabetes, infection with herpes zoster, HIV/AIDS, late-stage cancer, amputation (including mastectomy), carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic alcohol use, exposure to radiation, and as an unintended side-effect of neurotoxic treatment agents, such as certain anti-HIV and chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast to nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain is frequently described as \u201cburning,\u201d \u201celectric,\u201d \u201ctingling,\u201d or \u201cshooting\u201d in nature. It is often characterized by allodynia defined as pain resulting from a stimulus that does not ordinarily elicit a painful response such as light touch, and hyperalgesia defined as an increased sensitivity to a normally painful stimulus, and may persist for months or years beyond the apparent healing of any damaged tissues. One form of pain according to the invention is \u201cmechanical allodynia\u201d, which refers to the abnormal perception of pain from usually light mechanical stimulation, among allodynia which occurs due to a non-noxious stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, and it is the most severe neuropathic pain.",

Preferably the compounds and methods relating to the TrkA receptor and NGF fall in this category, and preferably shall be used in context of inflammatory pain. The term \u201cnociceptive pain\u201d refers to acute pain that arises under normal basal conditions, for example that associated with noxious mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli. The term \u201cinflammatory pain\u201d or a pain associated with inflammation is intended to describe the subset of acute and chronic pain that results from inflammatory processes, such as may arise in the case of arthritis, infections and neoplasia or tumor related hypertrophy. Inflammatory pain includes pain associated with osteo-arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy, arthritis associated with other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, degenerative conditions such as back strain and mechanical back pain or disc disease, post operative pain, pain from an injury such as a soft tissue bruise or strained ligament or broken bone, abscess or cellulitis, fibrositis or myositis, Felty's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, biorythmus, bunions, burstis of the knee, Celiac's disease, Cushing syndrome, Costochondritis and Teize's syndrome, dry eyes, ganglion, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), scleritis, relapsing polychondritis, pleurisy, connective tissue disease, steroid drug withdrawal, amyloidosis, uveitis, Raynard's phenomenon, osteopenia, chronic pain, Still's disease, swollen lymph nodes, Lyme disease, gout, sacroliac joint dysfunction, knee pain, lupus and ankle pain.

TrkB is a receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). TrkB is the high affinity catalytic receptor for several \u201cneurotrophins\u201d, which are small protein growth factors that induce the survival and differentiation of distinct cell populations. The neurotrophins that activate TrkB are: BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), and to a lesser extent neurotrophin-3 (NT-3).

The term \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibodies\u201d as used herein includes but is not limited to recombinant antibodies that are generated by recombinant technologies as known in the art. Included are antibodies' of any species, in particular of mammalian species, including antibodies having two essentially complete heavy and two essentially complete light chains, human antibodies of any isotype, including IgAi, lgA2, IgD, Igd, lgG2a, lgG2b, lgG3, lgG IgE and IgM and modified variants thereof, non-human primate antibodies, e.g. from chimpanzee, baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey, rodent antibodies, e.g. from mouse, rat or rabbit; goat or horse antibodies, and camelid antibodies (e.g. from camels or llamas such as Nanobodies\u2122) and derivatives thereof, or of bird species such as chicken antibodies or of fish species such as shark antibodies. The term \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibodies\u201d also refers to \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a first portion of at least one heavy and/or light chain antibody sequence is from a first species and a second portion of the heavy and/or light chain antibody sequence is from a second species.

For the most part, humanized antibodies are human antibodies (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region [or complementarity determining region (CDR)] of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken or non-human primate, having the desired specificity, affinity, and activity. In most instances residues of the human (recipient) antibody outside of the CDR; i.e. in the framework region (FR), are additionally replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. Humanization reduces the immunogenicity of non-human antibodies in humans, thus facilitating the application of antibodies to the treatment of human disease. Humanized antibodies and several different technologies to generate them are well known in the art.",
                        "The term \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibodies\u201d also refers to human antibodies, which can be generated as an alternative to humanization. For example, it is possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of production of endogenous murine antibodies. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies with specificity against a particular antigen upon immunization of the transgenic animal carrying the human germ-line immunoglobulin genes with said antigen. Technologies for producing such transgenic animals and technologies for isolating and producing the human antibodies from such transgenic animals are known in the art. Alternatively, in the transgenic animal; e.g. mouse, only the immunoglobulin genes coding for the variable regions of the mouse antibody are replaced with corresponding human variable immunoglobulin gene sequences. The mouse germline immunoglobulin genes coding for the antibody constant regions remain unchanged. In this way, the antibody effector functions in the immune system of the transgenic mouse and consequently the B cell development are essentially unchanged, which may lead to an improved antibody response upon antigenic challenge in vivo. Once the genes coding for a particular antibody of interest have been isolated from such transgenic animals the genes coding for the constant regions can be replaced with human constant region genes in order to obtain a fully human antibody. Other methods for obtaining human antibodies antibody fragments in vitro are based on display technologies such as phage display or ribosome display technology, wherein recombinant DNA libraries are used that are either generated at least in part artificially or from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires of donors. Phage and ribosome display technologies for generating human antibodies are well known in the art. Human antibodies may also be generated from isolated human B cells that are ex vivo immunized with an antigen of interest and subsequently fused to generate hybridomas which can then be screened for the optimal human antibody. The term \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibodies\u201d as used herein, also refers to an aglycosylated antibody. The term \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibodies\u201d as used herein not only refers to untruncated antibodies of any species, including from human (e.g. IgG) and other mammalian species, but also refers to an antibody fragment. A fragment of an antibody comprises at least one heavy or light chain immunoglobulin domain as known in the art and binds to one or more antigen(s).

                                "The inventors produced recombinant IL31 with a C-terminal fusion of SNAP (IL31SNAP) in E. Coli. Following purification and refolding from inclusion bodies, IL31SNAP was efficiently labelled with BG derivatized fluorophores (FIG. 1a) indicating that the SNAP tag was successfully incorporated and correctly folded in the fusion protein. To determine whether IL31SNAP was functional the inventors first performed binding studies in primary keratinocyte cultures. IL31SNAP was labelled in vitro with BG-Surface549 and applied to keratinocytes from wildtype or IL31 Receptor A (IL31RA) knockout mice (IL31RA\u2212/\u2212). At a range of concentrations the inventors observed strong fluorescent signal internalized in wildtype keratinocytes that was not present in cells for IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIGS. 1b and c). The inventors further examined IL31SNAP labelling in vivo by injecting IL31SNAP-Surface549 intradermally into the back skin of wild type and IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice. Again, fluorescent signal was observed in cells in skin sections from wildtype mice but not from IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIGS. 1d and e). Finally, the inventors determined whether IL31SNAP was active by quantifying scratching behavior in mice upon intradermal injection. IL31SNAP evoked robust scratching that was comparable in duration and intensity to native recombinant IL31 in wildtype mice. In IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice, IL31SNAP and IL31 did not evoke scratching (FIG. 1f). Thus the IL31SNAP retains the functional properties of native IL31.",
                                "**Example 2: IL31 Mediated Photoablation**",
                                "To manipulate IL31 receptor expressing cells in vivo, the inventors reasoned that IL31SNAP may allow for targeted photoablation of these cells through delivery of a photosensitizing agent. The inventors synthesized a benzylguanine modified derivative of the highly potent near-infrared photosensitizer IRDye\u00ae700DX phthalocyanine (IR700) and conjugated it in vitro to IL31SNAP (20). Application of IL31SNAP-IR700 to keratinocytes followed by 1 minute illumination provoked substantial cell death (FIG. 1g) that was not evident in keratinocytes only treated with IR700 (FIG. 1h) or in keratinocytes from IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 1i). The inventors further examined photosensitizer induced cell death in skin by injecting IL31SNAP-IR700 and applying near infrared light to the skin. TUNEL positive apoptotic cells were observed throughout the epidermis and dermis of the illuminated area in wildtype mice (FIG. 1j), but largely absent in skin from IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 1k). The inventors next examined whether IL31SNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation would impact upon IL31 evoked scratching behavior. Strikingly, a progressive decrease in scratching bouts was observed when IL31SNAP-IR700 was injected for three consecutively days and the skin illuminated (FIG. 1l).",
                                "**Example 3: Generation and Characterization of a Non-Signaling IL31 Mutant**",
                                "A conceptual problem of using IL31SNAP therapeutically is that it in itself evokes itch. The inventors therefore sought to engineer IL31SNAP to obtain a ligand that still binds to IL31 receptor complex but no longer promotes signaling. From a previous structure/function study (21) the inventors selected an IL31 point mutant IL31K138A that was reported to exhibit reduced signaling in cells expressing IL31 receptors. The K138A mutation denotes the murine IL31 mutations. The corresponding mutation in the human IL31 protein is at position K134 in the human IL31 (SEQ ID NO: 1). The inventors generated a recombinant IL31K138A-SNAP fusion protein, labelled it with BG-Surface549 and applied it to keratinocytes. Pronounced fluorescence was evident in cells from wildtype mice treated with fluorescent IL31K138A-SNAP (FIG. 2a), at a similar concentration range to that observed with IL31SNAP (Supplementary FIG. 2). Importantly, such signal was not present in IL31RA\u2212/\u2212 keratinocytes (FIG. 2b). The inventors further assessed cellular signaling pathways activated by IL31SNAP and IL30K138A-SNAP in the skin by examining levels of phosphorylated Akt, pMAPK and pSTAT3 which have all been previously implicated in IL31 downstream signaling (14, 21, 22). Mice were injected subcutaneously with IL31SNAP and IL31K138A-SNAP and skin harvested 1 hour later for immunoblot analysis. The inventors observed increased phosphorylation in each pathway in skin injected with IL31SNAP, and this increase was absent in skin injected with IL311K138A-SNAP (FIGS. 2c and d). As a final test for the functional activity of IL31K138A-SNAP, the inventors assayed its capacity to provoke scratching behavior in mice. In contrast to IL31SNAP which induced robust scratching when injected intradermal, IL31K138A-SNAP did not evoke any scratching above baseline levels in mice (FIG. 3e). Thus the engineered ligand IL31K138A-SNAP may offer a powerful means of targeting cells involved in itch without triggering itch in itself.",
                                "**Example 4: IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 Mediated Photoablation and Acute Itch**",
                                "To characterize IL31K138A-SNAP mediated photoablation in vivo, the inventors first tested its efficacy at alleviating IL31 provoked itch. Mice were treated for three consecutively days with IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 and the skin was illuminated with near-IR light. Strikingly, IL31-induced scratching behavior was abolished in these animals (FIG. 2f), and this persisted throughout an 8 week observation period (Supplementary FIG. 2l). In control mice that received an IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 injection but were not illuminated, the inventors observed no reduction in IL31-evoked scratching (FIG. 2f). The inventors next tested the effects of photoablation on scratching provoked by other acutely applied pruritogens. Intriguingly, IL31K138A-SNAP guided photoablation had no significant effect on histamine, chloroquine or LY344864 (a serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonist) evoked itch (FIG. 2f). Finally, to assess the specificity of photoablation to itch sensation, the inventors examined other sensory modalities after treatment. Using the hot plate test to assay thermal sensitivity (FIG. 2g), and calibrated von Frey filaments to measure mechanical sensitivity (FIG. 2h), the inventors observed no difference in response properties of treated mice, indicating that IL31 guided laser ablation is indeed a selective and effective means of disrupting the itch pathway.",

                                "The inventors examined the effects of IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 ablation on inflammatory skin conditions using the well characterized Calcipotriol model of atopic dermatitis (23). To assess the effectiveness of treatment the inventors monitored three indicators of clinical progression; scratching behavior, skin integrity and skin histology. The inventors first determined whether pretreatment with IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 would abolish the development of the disease, and then investigated whether post-treatment, upon establishment of robust inflammation, could reverse symptoms.",
                                "As previously reported (M. Li et al., Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103, 11736-11741 (2006)), application of Calcipotriol to skin provoked a severe atopic dermatitis-like phenotype that was evident as a progressive increase in the number of spontaneous scratching bouts over time, distinct skin damage, and a thickening of the epidermis and cell infiltration (not shown). Injection of IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 and subsequent near IR illumination of the skin for 3 days prior to Calcipotriol application completely abolished the development of all indicators in this model. Thus scratching behavior remained at baseline levels (FIG. 3a), skin thickness and histological characteristics were not altered (FIGS. 3b and c), skin appeared healthy and typical features of dermatitis such as redness and scaling were entirely absent (FIG. 3d). To control for a pharmacological antagonistic effect of IL31K138A-SNAP the inventors performed identical experiments in the absence of near IR illumination and observed the normal development of dermatitis-like symptoms (FIGS. 3a-d). Similarly, near IR light and IR700 alone were also ineffective at blocking the progression of the condition (not shown).",
                                "For IL31K138A-guided photoablation to be developed as a clinical tool, it must also be effective in reversing already established skin inflammation. The inventors therefore treated mice with Calcipotriol for 7 days until severe symptoms were evident. IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 was then injected subcutaneously and near IR light applied to the skin for three consecutively days. Strikingly, the inventors observed a rescue of all disease indicators over the course of 1 week. Thus scratching behavior returned to baseline levels (FIG. 3e), and skin thickness (FIG. f), morphology (FIG. 3g)) and structure (FIG. 3h) became indistinguishable from healthy mice. Such profound reversal of dermatitis-like symptoms was not evident in control experiments where IL31K138A-SNAP was applied without subsequent near IR illumination (FIG. 3e-h).",
                                "Finally, to further improve the clinical applicability of IL31K138A guided photoablation, the inventors sought to develop a formulation that would allow for topical, pain-free application of IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700. The inventors selected a water-in-oil micro-emulsion preparation based upon previous evidence that this type of formulation can deliver high molecular weight proteins across the dermal barrier (R. Himes, S. Lee, K. McMenigall, G. J. Russell-Jones, Reduction in inflammation in the footpad of carrageenan treated mice following the topical administration of anti-TNF molecules formulated in a micro-emulsion. J Control Release 145, 210-213 (2010)). IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 was loaded into the aqueous phase of the micro-emulsion, applied topically and 20 minutes later, skin was illuminated with near IR light. Similar to subcutaneous delivery, topical application of IL31K138A-SNAP-IR700 both prevented and reversed Calcipotriol provoked dermatitis-like symptoms. This was evident as a return to baseline levels of scratching behavior (FIGS. 3i and k) and a normalization of skin structure and histology (FIGS. 3j and l). Thus molecule guided delivery of a photosensitizer complex allows for on-demand, pain-free control of chronic itch.",

                                "**Example 5: TrkB Positive Neurons are a Subset of Mechanoreceptive Neurons**",
                                "Using TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26RFP reporter mice the inventors examined colocalization of TrkB with established cellular markers in adult sensory ganglia. Approximately 10% of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were positive for TrkBCreERT2, corresponding to the \u02dc8% of cells which expressed TrkB mRNA (FIG. 1I). Expression was evident in 2 populations of large neurons marked by NF200 and NF200 plus Ret (FIG. 4A, B, I), and not present in nociceptors positive for CGRP or IB4, or C low threshold mechanoreceptors marked by TH (FIG. 4C-E, I). The inventors further investigated the projections of TrkB neurons to the skin and spinal cord. TrkBCreERT2 fibres extended to Meissner corpuscles in the glabrous skin (FIG. 4F) and formed longitudinal lanceolate endings around hair follicles (FIG. 4G). To assay TrkBCreERT2 positive sensory input into the spinal cord a reporter line was generated in which Cre dependent expression of mCherry was driven from the sensory neuron specific Avil locus. TrkBCreERT2::AvilmCherry positive sensory neurons were present in laminae III/IV of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where they formed column-like structures extending dorsally (FIG. 4H). The authors also examined expression of TrkB in human tissue using a TrkB antibody. In agreement with mouse data, TrkB immunoreactivity was present in human DRG in large neurons co-expressing NF200 and Ret but largely absent from nociceptors expressing TrkA (FIG. 4i-k, n). Similarly, in glabrous skin, TrkB immunoreactivity was detected in NF200 positive fibers innervating Meissner corpuscles (FIG. 4l). Collectively, these data indicate that TrkBCreERT2 marks a population of putative mechanoreceptive neurons in mouse and human.",
                                "To unequivocally establish the identity of TrkBCreERT2 positive sensory neurons the inventors characterized their response properties utilizing a combination of electrophysiology and optogenetic activation. Mice expressing the light-gated ion channel channel-rhodopsin in TrkB positive cells were generated (TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2) and an ex vivo skin nerve preparation used to identify neuronal subtypes which could be concomitantly activated by light. Strikingly, the inventors determined that all D-hair and RAMs could be stimulated by light (FIG. 40-q) whereas all other subtypes of sensory neurons were not responsive (FIG. 40-q). Thus TrkB marks myelinated neurons that innervate hair follicles and are tuned to detect gentle moving mechanical stimuli.",
                                "**Example 6: Ablation of TrkB Positive Neurons Affects Exclusively Light Mechanical Sensation**",
                                "To determine the role played by TrkBCreERT2 positive D-hairs and RAMs in sensory evoked behavior, the inventors genetically ablated TrkB neurons in the peripheral nervous system. A Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin receptor transgene knocked-in to the sensory neuron specific Avil locus was generated that allowed for selective deletion of TrkB positive neurons only in adult sensory ganglia. Upon systemic injection of diphtheria toxin a \u02dc90% ablation of TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR and TrkB mRNA positive neurons was achieved with a parallel reduction in the number of NF200 positive neurons by \u02dc40% and no change in the expression of other markers (FIG. 5A-C).",
                                "The inventors performed a series of behavioral tests in these animals examining sensory responses to a range of thermal and mechanical stimuli. There was no difference in responses to evaporative cooling evoked by acetone application (FIG. 5D), or in thresholds to noxious heat (FIG. 5E) after diphtheria toxin ablation. Similarly, grip strength (FIG. 5F) was unaltered by ablation of TrkBCreERT2 neurons, as were responses to noxious pinprick (FIG. 5G), and static mechanical stimulation of the hairy skin evoked by application of tape to the back (FIG. 5H). Further examined were the responses to dynamic mechanical stimuli by monitoring responses to brushing of the plantar surface of a paw. Using a puffed out cotton swab which exerts forces in the range 0.7-1.6 mN, the inventors observed a significant reduction in responsiveness upon ablation of TrkB positive neurons (FIG. 5I). Intriguingly, these differences were not apparent upon application of stronger dynamic forces using a paint brush (>4 mN, FIG. 6B, D). Thus under basal conditions, TrkB positive sensory neurons are required for behavioral responses to the lightest of dynamic mechanical stimuli.",
                                "**Example 7: TrkB Sensory Neurons are Necessary and Sufficient to Convey Mechanical Pain in a Neuropathic Pain Model**",
                                "On account of the exquisite sensitivity of TrkB positive neurons, the inventors next asked whether they contribute to mechanical hypersensitivity in models of injury induced pain. The inventors took both a loss of function approach using genetic ablation, and a gain of function approach using optogenetic activation of TrkB neurons. First considered was a model of inflammatory pain by injecting Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) into the plantar surface of the paw, and monitoring responses to von Frey filaments and dynamic brush stimuli. Ablation of TrkB neurons in TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR mice had no effect on either basal mechanical sensitivity or mechanical hypersensitivity after inflammation (FIG. 6A-B).",
                                "It was further examined whether optogenetic activation of TrkB neurons could evoke pain behavior under inflammatory conditions. Using stimulation parameters which evoked robust firing in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation, the inventors observed no discernible behavioral response to light application to the paw either in basal conditions or after inflammation in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (FIG. 6C). Importantly, identical stimulation conditions applied to the auricle of the ear evoked a brief ear twitch in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (not shown), likely reflecting activation of the dense network of mechanoreceptors in this structure.",
                                "Next neuropathic pain was induced in mice using the Spared Nerve Injury (SNI) model. Control mice developed a profound mechanical hypersensitivity in the sural nerve territory of the paw to both von Frey filaments and dynamic brush stimuli (FIGS. 6D and E). Strikingly, upon ablation of TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR sensory neurons, mice did not develop mechanical allodynia to either punctate or brushing stimuli, and mechanical sensitivity remained at preinjury levels throughout the observation period. The inventors performed further experiments in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice to optogenetically activate these neurons. Three days after injury it was observed that selective stimulation of TrkB neurons with light evoked behavior indicative of pain. This was evident as a prolonged paw withdrawal from the stimulation, lifting of the paw and licking of the illuminated area (FIG. 6F) that continued for several minutes after light application. Such behavior persisted throughout the 2 weeks observation period and was never observed in control mice (FIG. 6F).",
                                "As a neuronal correlate of this apparent pain behavior, the inventors examined induction of the immediate early gene C-fos in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice without injury, optical stimulation evoked C-fos immunoreactivity primarily in laminae III and IV of the spinal cord, the region where TrkB neurons terminate (FIGS. 6G and I). Upon nerve injury however, identical stimulation parameters induced C-fos staining in lamina I of the dorsal horn, an area associated with nociceptive processing. Thus under neuropathic pain conditions, TrkB sensory neurons are necessary and sufficient to convey the light touch signal that evokes pain.",
                                "Example 8: Treatment of Mechanical Allodynia In Vivo",
                                "In light of the clinical importance of mechanical allodynia in neuropathic pain patients, it was sought to develop a pharmacological strategy to exploit the striking selectivity of TrkB to the peripheral neurons which provoke this pain state. It was reasoned that BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, may give access to these neurons and allow for their manipulation in wildtype, non-transgenic animals. To this end the inventors produced a recombinant BDNF protein with a SNAP-tag fused to its C-terminus that would enable its chemical derivatization. BDNFSNAP was labelled in vitro with fluorescent SNAP-Surface647 substrate and applied to HEK293T cells expressing neurotrophin receptors. Fluorescently labelled BDNFSNAP displayed remarkable selectivity for its cognate receptor complex TrkB/p75 (FIG. 7A), and did not bind to cells expressing related neurotrophin receptors TrkA/p75 (FIG. 7B) or TrkC/p75 (FIG. 7C).",
                                "The inventors further tested whether BDNFSNAP would recognize native TrkB receptors in DRG neurons. BDNFSNAP was conjugated to Qdot 655 quantum dots and applied to dissociated DRG from TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26RFP mice. a >95% overlap between BDNFSNAP and TrkBCreERT2 positive cells (FIG. 7D) was observed indicating that recombinant BDNFSNAP is a highly selective means of targeting TrkB neurons.",
                                "To manipulate TrkB neurons in vivo, it was reasoned that BDNFSNAP may allow for targeted photoablation of these neurons through delivery of a photosensitizing agent. The inventors synthesized a benzylguanine modified derivative of the highly potent near-infrared photosensitizer IRDye\u00ae700 DX phthalocyanine (IR700) and conjugated it in vitro to BDNFSNAP. In initial experiments BDNFSNAP-IR700 was applied to HEK293T cells expressing TrkB/p75 and cell death assayed following near infrared illumination. In cells expressing TrkB/p75 the inventors observed substantial cell death 24 hours after brief illumination (FIG. 7E) that was not evident upon mock transfection or treatment with IR700 alone (FIG. 7F).",
                                "The inventors next sought to assess the therapeutic potential of this approach by investigating the effects of BDNFSNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation in wildtype mice with neuropathic pain. Upon establishment of robust mechanical allodynia three days after SNI, a range of concentrations of BDNFSNAP-IR700 was injected into the ipsilateral paw of injured mice and the skin illuminated with different light intensities. Strikingly, the inventors observed a concentration and illumination dependent rescue of both von Frey withdrawal thresholds (FIG. 8a) and dynamic brush or cotton swab evoked allodynia (FIG. 8b and c) that persisted for more than 3 weeks after a single treatment regime. It was examined whether such pronounced effects were also evident in other types of neuropathic pain. Indeed, in both the streptozotocin model of painful diabetic neuropathy, and the paclitaxel model of chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain, a marked reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity that peaked around 10 days post treatment and returned to injury levels by day 20 (FIG. 8d and e) was observed. To determine the selectivity of this approach, the inventors further assessed the effects of BDNFSNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation on behavioral responses under basal conditions. No deficits in sensitivity to cold, heat, or pinprick upon treatment were observed (FIG. 8f to h). Responses to cotton swab were also unaffected by photoablation (FIG. 3i), perhaps because the skin area that is stimulated in this test extends beyond the zone of illumination.",
                                "To investigate the mechanism by which BDNFSNAP-IR700 reverses mechanical allodynia, a TrkBCreERT2::Ros26SNAPCaaX reporter mouse line was used to identify TrkB positive afferents, and a PGP9.5 antibody to label all fibers, in order to examine the innervation density of hypersensitive skin over the course of phototherapy. Prior to photoablation, TrkB positive lanceolate endings were detected around hair follicles (FIG. 9a) and innervating Meissner corpuscles in the plantar surface of the paw. At 7 days after photoablation (13 days post-SNI) when behavioral reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity was most pronounced, a selective loss of TrkB fibers but persistent innervation by PGP9.5 fibers in hairy and glabrous skin was observed (FIG. 9b, f, g). Indeed, many hair follicles displayed a complete loss of TrkB innervation but still contained PGP9.5 positive circumferential and longitudinal lanceolate endings demonstrating the remarkable specificity of ablation (FIG. 9c). At 24 days post-photoablation when mechanical hypersensitivity had reverted, TrkB positive fibers were again seen innervating their appropriate end organs in both glabrous and hairy skin (FIG. 9d). Importantly, there was no apparent reduction in innervation of control tissue injected with unconjugated IR700 and illuminated (FIG. 9f). It was further investigated whether loss of TrkBCreERT2 neurons was also evident at the level of the cell soma by analyzing the number of TrkBCreERT2 positive neurons in the DRG. No differences in the proportion of TrkB neurons 10 days after photoablation were observed (FIG. 9e and f), indicating that the loss of fibers likely reflects local retraction from their peripheral targets.",
                                "TrkB is also expressed by other cells in the skin in addition to sensory fibers. The inventors sought to identify these cell types and determine whether they are lost upon photoablation and contribute to the behavioral phenotype. TrkB was not detected in Merkel cells, keratinocytes, or dendritic and dermal antigen presenting cells, and BDNFSNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation did not alter their numbers in the skin (FIG. 9g). Expression of TrkB was however evident in cells labelled with CD34, a marker of mast cells and epithelial and endothelial progenitor cells. Moreover, photoablation significantly reduced the number of CD34 positive cells in the skin (FIG. 9g). To determine whether it is loss of these cells or TrkB+ afferents which influences sensory behavior, BDNFSNAP-IR700 was injected into the sciatic nerve at mid-thigh level and the nerve illuminated to ablate TrkB sensory fibers but spare CD34 cells in the skin. In these animals, behavioral responses to cooling, heating and pinprick were normal (FIG. 9h-j), however, sensitivity to cotton swab was reduced (FIG. 9k), paralleling the results using genetic ablation. It was further investigated whether optogenetically evoked pain behavior in SNI mice is dependent upon CD34 + cells or TrkB+ fibers in the skin. Upon photoablation of TrkB+ fibers in the sciatic nerve a significant reduction in light driven nocifensive behavior in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (FIG. 9l) was observed. Thus, TrkB+ sensory afferents, rather than other cells in the skin likely underlie behavioral sensitivity to light touch under basal conditions and after nerve lesion.",
                                "In summary, the results identify the first relay station in the neuronal pathway that confers pain from gentle touch under neuropathic pain states. It was demonstrated that TrkBCreERT2 positive sensory neurons detect the lightest touch under basal conditions but after nerve injury are both necessary and sufficient to drive mechanical allodynia.",
                                "The invention further describes a new technology based upon ligand mediated delivery of a phototoxic agent to target these neurons and reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain states. This approach is analogous to clinically approved capsaicin patches, in which a high concentration of capsaicin is applied to the skin and leads to retraction of nociceptive fibers. Instead, here the invention targets directly the neurons responsible for mechanical allodynia, allowing for local, on demand treatment of pain through application of light.",
                                "**Example 9: Treatment of Inflammatory Pain using NGF to Target Nociceptive Sensory Neurons**",
                                "A similar experiment as with BDNF was performed with nerve growth factor (NGF). The reasoning here was that TrkA, the receptor for NGF is expressed exclusively by nociceptive sensory neurons, thus their ablation should allow for treatment of acute and inflammatory pain. In initial experiments, a recombinant NGFSNAP protein was produced and shown to bind to TrkA positive cells and not TrkB or TrkC. NGFSNAP was conjugated to IR700 and injected into the paw of mice which was then illuminated with near IR light in the treatment group, while a control group received no illumination. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the paw, and responses to thermal stimuli monitored for a period of 50 days. In the control group NGF itself produced a robust thermal hyperalgesia which was further increased by CFA injections. In animals illuminated with near IR light, thermal hyperalgesia did not develop (FIG. 10a). In a further experiment, CFA was injected first and then the paw was subjected to NGFSNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation and mechanical hypersensitivity was monitored. In control animals which received no illumination, robust mechanical hypersensitivity developed which was maintained throughout the 25 day observation period. In animals which received near IR light, and substantial reduction in mechanical withdrawal thresholds was observed and mechanical sensitivity returned to baseline levels (FIG. 10b).",
                                "A conceptual problem with using NGFSNAP as a means of targeting TrkA positive nociceptors is that it in itself evokes pain and sensitization. To circumvent this problem, the authors generated an engineered NGFSNAP with Arginine mutated to Tryptophan at position 121 (NGFR121W-SNAP). This molecule was found to bind specifically to Hek293 cells expressing TrkA and p75 receptors (FIG. 10c) and to evoke cell death when conjugated to IR700 and applied to these cells and illuminated (FIG. 10d). Importantly, when NGFR121W-SNAP was injected into the paw of mice it did not provoke mechanical hypersensitivity, while wildtype NGFSNAP had a strong sensitizing effect (FIG. 10e). Thus NGFR121W-SNAP is a \u201cpainless\u201d NGF derivative that binds to TrkA receptors but does not activate pain signaling pathways.",
                                "To determine whether NGFR121W-SNAP can be used as a photosensitizing agent to control pain, the authors conjugated it to IR700 and injected it into skin for subsequent near IR light illumination. Acute behavioral responses were first examined. NGFR121W-SNAP mediated photoablation was found to significantly elevate painful mechanical withdrawal latencies to von Frey filaments, while non-illuminated controls showed no change (FIG. 11a). Similarly, responses to painful pinprick were reduced by photoablation (FIG. 11b) while non-nociceptive responses to brush were not affected (FIG. 11c). Finally, the authors examined the efficacy of photoablation under inflammatory pain conditions. Using the CFA model of inflammatory pain, it was found the NGFR121W-SNAP-IR700 mediated photoablation led to prolonged recovery of both thermal hyperalgesia (FIG. 11d) and mechanical hypersensitivity (FIG. 11e) in this model. Thus NGFR121W-SNAP can be used to control acute nociceptive pain and hypersensitivity that results from an inflammatory stimulus."
