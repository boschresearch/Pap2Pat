In that respect, the 6MIE promoter by itself shows higher activity than the CMV promoter in cultured cells from T-cell lines such as Molt-3, Jurkat, and SupT1. A combination of this 6MIE promoter with the present enhancer causes a further increase in activity.

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refer to nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, and refer to essentially identical sequences if the nucleic acids do not encode amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For example, codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide.

                                "In an aspect, the present invention provides an enhancer for a promoter, which comprises an intron sequence for a major immediate early gene (MIE) of human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) or a fragment of the intron sequence. In particular, it has been found that this enhancer has unexpectedly enhanced the ability of a viral promoter such as an HHV-6B MIE promoter or the like.",
                                "It has been found that the HHV-6B MIE promoter, with an HHV7 MIE promoter, and an HHV7 U95 promoter, is unexpectedly enhanced in selectivity to lymphocytes in comparison to HCMV IE promoters. It is understood that the enhancer of the present invention can further enhance such selectivity. Further, it has been found that in adhesive cells (293 cells, Vero cells and the like), the MIE promoter only showed one hundredth the activity of that of HCMV IE promoter, whereas in lymphoid cells such as SupT1 and U937, a several fold increase in expression efficiency is obtained. Such a high level of selectivity or specificity accounts for capability of application to DNA vaccines, and particularly to the development of a pharmaceutical agent that targets lymphocytes as gene therapy. In this regard, it is understandable that the enhancer of the present invention can further enhance such an effect. Moreover, in an expression system in vivo, since activities are diminished even in the case of CMV promoters which have potent activity, due to the action of methylase, it is understood that the enhancer for a promoter of the present invention may be used to secure an amount of expression in vivo in blood cells or lymphocyte cells. In genetic diseases, gene therapy for cancer, or the like, retrovirus vectors are generally used; however, since LTR activity is not so potent as a promoter, the introduction of the enhancer for a promoter of the present invention into the upstream of the gene to be expressed allows potent expression in blood cells. The present invention is useful in gene therapy targeting blood cell diseases such as leukemia. Furthermore, RNAi is used as a method for knocking out gene expression, and the enhancer for a promoter of the present invention is used as an enhancer for a promoter of hair-pin type RNA expression vectors, thereby allowing more efficient effects of inhibition of expression in the blood cells. Macrophages, dendritic cells or the like are purified from native peripheral blood using flow cytometry, and these cells are transfected with plasmids constructed so as to express cancer specific antigen, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene and the like under controlling the enhancer for a promoter of the present invention, and reintroduced to the original body after confirmation of expression of a cancer antigen, thereby practicing the gene therapy of cancer as a result of efficient activation of cancer antigen specific CTL via Class I-HLA.",

Here, the biological activity may be a promoter activity and/or an enhancer activity, but is not limited thereto. The promoter activity and the enhancer activity can be determined using techniques well-known in the art. Such techniques are also described in the present specification and illustrated in examples.",

The smaller the numbers of substitutions, additions, and deletions is preferred. However, the larger the number of substitutions, additions, and deletions is allowable as long as the promoter retains its biological activities (preferably, the promoter has similar or substantially the same activities as those of HHV-6B MIE promoter).",
