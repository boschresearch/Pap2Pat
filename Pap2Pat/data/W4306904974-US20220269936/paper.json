    "title": "Knowledge Graph Guided Simultaneous Forecasting and Network Learning for Multivariate Financial Time Series",
    "date": "2022-10-26",
    "abstract": "Financial time series forecasting is challenging due to limited sample size, correlated samples, low signal strengths, among others. Additional information with knowledge graphs (KGs) can allow for improved prediction and decision making. In this work, we explore a framework GregNets for jointly learning forecasting models and correlations structures that exploit graph connectivity from KGs. We propose novel regularizers based on KG relations to guide estimation of correlation structure. We develop a pseudo-likelihood layer that can learn the error residual structure for any multivariate time-series forecasting architecture in deep learning APIs (e.g. Tensorflow). We evaluate our modeling and algorithmic proposals in small sample regimes in real-world financial markets with two types of KGs. Our empirical results demonstrate sparser connectivity structures, runtime improvements and high-quality predictions.",

                "Time series analysis is a problem central to finance and statistics [44]. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling and forecasting in multivariate time-series panel data {\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc61 } \ud835\udc61 \u2208 [\ud835\udc47 ] where, \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc61 \u2208 R \ud835\udc41 is a vector of panel measurements at time \ud835\udc61 \u2208 [\ud835\udc47 ] := {1, . . . ,\ud835\udc47 }. Our study is motivated by challenging financial timeseries forecasting problems (e.g., volatility, volume forecasting) characterised by relatively large panel-sizes, limited sample sizes than the number of nodes \ud835\udc41 . We differ in that we use these models in the context of a joint mean and covariance learning framework and perform this joint learning in very limited sample regimes in the context of financial applications. We model the unexplained residuals \ud835\udf50 \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc61 -\ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 via a multivariate Gaussian graphical model [25]. We model the precision matrix [31] or partial correlations of the errors to be sparse-the sparsity structure is partially (not fully) informed by KGs. Our framework GregNets extends the framework of [5] in multiple ways: we propose faster algorithms (100\u00d7-250\u00d7) for joint training, incorporate flexible GCN models for the panel component, and use KGs to inform the partial correlation matrices.",
                "Joint training. Jointly training the conditional mean function and error correlation structure leads to algorithmic challenges. When \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 is a sparse linear model (e.g., sparse VAR), we present a joint proximal gradient descent algorithm [7,39] to simultaneously learn \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 and a sparse partial correlation matrix for \ud835\udf50 \ud835\udc61 via a pseudolikeihood approach that results in improvements over the recently proposed algorithm of [5]. When \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 corresponds to a GCN or other generic temporal (graph) neural networks, we embed the partial correlation learning into our proposed pseudo-likelihood layer, append it to the temporal graph neural network layers, and train the time-series parameters as well as the partial correlation simultaneously via backpropagation with (adaptive) stochastic gradient descent.",
                "Contributions. The key contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we propose a joint modeling and training framework GregNets2 to learn the conditional mean function for the panels and the error correlation structure for the innovations -both of these incorporate KGs as structured priors. (2) Joint training leads to computational challenges. We address this by developing a pseudolikelihood layer that incorporates the KG information and can be easily appended to any existing multivariate time-series forecasting architecture trainable with (stochastic) gradient descent. (3) We demonstrate the usefulness of GregNets for S&P500/S&P1500 stock volatilities time-series analysis for improved prediction, reduced model complexity, faster optimization and better interpretability."

                "The partial correlation learning sub-problem is related to the rich literature on high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models [25,31], and central to the portfolio optimization in finance [36]. Given a data matrix, common approaches to learn a corresponding \u2113 1sparse precision matrix are the graphical lasso [21], row-by-row estimation methods [38], the pseudo-likelihood framework [8,42]. Recently, [3,45] propose the MTP 2 method to learn a precision matrix with nonpositive entries. For other methods on covariance matrix estimation, see [18] for a nice overview. The above methods focus on learning correlation matrices; and assume that the timeseries panel component \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 \u2261 0.",
                "VAR is a popular linear modeling tool for modeling the dynamics of panel time series data, with wide applications in various domains [28,44]. However, the number of parameters in VAR grows quadratically with the number of time series components, hence regularization is called for. Common methods to reduce the complexity of VAR models include \u2113 1 -regularization [24], canonical correlation analysis, factor models [9], among others-see [40] for further discussions. Apart from VAR-based models, there are some other traditional statistical time series models in financial econometrics [4,19,43]. All of these models learn \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 ; but they do not directly learn the correlation structure of the residuals.",
                "There is a large body of recent literature on GCNs. The fundamental GCN idea was formulated by [30] and originally studied for author citation networks [2,30]. The idea has been extended to time-series modelling by combining graph convolution operation with recurrent/1D convolution architectures to capture dynamics in [34,35,46,48]. These networks have been primarily explored in the context of traffic forecasting datasets where the number of samples is very large compared to number of nodes. Some recent financial literature uses variation of these modelling ideas in the context of stock prediction [20,37]; see also [29] for a nice review of different applications of deep learning for stock market prediction.",

However, our work differs in that (i) we use KG information to aid learning of the partial correlation matrix and/or a NN-based model for \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 , (ii) we allow for a GNN model for \ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc61 while [5] considers VAR models, (iii) our proposed algorithm for joint training is more general; and when specialized to the specific task considered in [5], our proposed algorithms are much faster.",
                "Our proposals are evaluated on knowledge graphs, some of which are close in spirit to those used in financial econometrics literature. Existing modelling approaches with financial KGs have explored different forms of connectivity information such as industrysector classification [20] and first and second order relationships from text data [11,20,37]. We explore a new KG, proposed in [33], constructed on the basis of aggregated co-search of financial information by analysts, which is described in more detail in section 5.1. We also consider KG created using one type of financial indicator (e.g. returns) to improve prediction/correlation structure estimation for another financial indicator (e.g. volatilities)."

GCNs process past time-samples of multivariate time-series with graph operations, e.g. graph convolutions, before feeding them into a linear model of significantly reduced model complexity.

There are many temporal graph convolution variants. For instance, T-GCN follows graph convolution layers by gated recurrent units [48]; along the same spirit, a multitude of architectures such as dynamic graph convolutional networks [35], diffusion convolutional network [34], spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks [46] etc. model dynamic dependence with recurrent/convolutional layers with some intermediate graph convolution operations.

For both S&P500 and S&P1500 markets, we see a flat curve for hard masking when \ud835\udefc \u2208 (0, 1), above the \ud835\udc45 2 of both end points, which implies using the union of the sparse structure helps improve the performance. For the soft masking case, the best combination (\ud835\udefc = 0.9) outperforms the test \ud835\udc45 2 from hard masking. For S&P500, the test \ud835\udc45 2 is 35.90%, which is even better than any results using the cosearch graph alone. For S&P1500, the test \ud835\udc45 2 using the combination with \ud835\udc3e = 75 is comparable to the cosearch graph masking with \ud835\udc3e = 125. Compared to soft masking on cosearch graph, soft masking with \ud835\udefc = 0.9 may have almost the same effect on the edges from the cosearch graph, but it also allows for the edges from the return PC graph (with high penalties). Therefore, the superior performance of the combined graph over the cosearch graph implies that the strong partial correlation connections are mainly from the cosearch graph, but the return PC graph contains some important weak connections that can help improve the prediction.

We highlight that VAR-PC models outperform both LSTM-PC and temporal graph convolution networks (T-GCN-PC) perhaps due to over-parameterization in these recurrent NN architectures; hence models tend to overfit severely when there are few to learn from. We see significant gains in predictive performance with simpler graph convolution architectures such as GCNs and N-GCNs. This confirms the effectiveness EDGAR cosearch graph as an adjacency matrix in the context of stock volatility with GCNs.

For each sector \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc58 , we consider the set of all edges from the sector, i.e. {(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) : \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc58 }, as all samples, and report the precision metrics of whether the sparsity pattern given by learned \ud835\udf46 can correctly recover the edges within the same sector, i.e. the set {(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) : \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc58 }. The table indicates that for all the sectors, the \ud835\udf46 learned using KG has higher recovering precision than the one learned without KG. Additional results of VAR-PC for S&P500 and S&P1500 volume. Finally, we evaluate our VAR-PC framework in predicting the S&P500 and S&P1500 daily trading volumes. We apply the same detrending process to the log trading volume time series, and use the EDGAR cosearch KG in GregNets. The results of VAR-PC are summarized in Table 4. The results still exhibit the \ud835\udc45 2 boost and sparsity improvement when incorporating the KG information into the model. "
