# DESCRIPTION

- introduce oncolytic viruses
- describe Myxoma virus and its properties
- summarize previous research on Myxoma virus as oncolytic agent
- introduce attenuated vaccine strain SG33 of Myxoma virus

## Example 1

### Comparison of the Efficiency of Replication of the SB33 Strain and the Wild-type Strain Toulouse 1 in Human Tumor Cells

- compare replication efficiency of SG33 and Toulouse 1 strains in human tumor cells

## Example 2

### Comparison of the Kinetics of Diffusion of the Toulouse 1 and SG33 Viruses Expressing Beta-Galactosidase

- compare diffusion kinetics of SG33 and Toulouse 1 viruses in infected cells

## Example 3

### Comparison of the Oncolytic Properties of the  Toulouse 1 and SG33 Viruses

- compare oncolytic properties of SG33 and Toulouse 1 viruses
