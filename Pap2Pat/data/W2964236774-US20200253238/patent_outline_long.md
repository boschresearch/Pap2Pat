## EXAMPLE 1

- mechanically pretreat larvae to larvae juice and chitin rich fraction
- mix larvae juice with lactic acid and separate into three layers
- recover and analyze upper layer, pellet 1, and pellet 2
- determine protein and lipid composition of different fractions

## EXAMPLE 2

- treat crushed larvae with lactate and separate into four layers
- recover and analyze upper layer, supernatant, pellet 1, and exoskeleton pellet
- determine mass balance and protein and lipid composition of different fractions
- optimize conditions for lipid and protein extraction

## Comparative Experiment A

- simulate rendering by mixing larvae juice with water and heating
- separate into upper layer, pellet 1, and pellet 2
- compare protein and lipid composition to Example 1

## Comparative Experiment B

- treat crushed larvae with HCl and fail to extract lipids

## EXAMPLE 3-6: EFFECT OF THE NATURE OF THE ORGANIC ACID

- prepare insect juice and treat with lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, and lactic acid at pH 2
- separate into upper layer, pellet 1, and pellet 2
- determine protein and lipid composition of different fractions
- calculate mass balances and yields
- evaluate performance of different acid treatments
- compare protein yields and purities
- conclude that lactic acid treatment is superior

## EXAMPLE 7. EXTRACTION OF LIPIDS AND PROTEINS FROM MINCED MEAT, BY TREATMENT WITH LACTIC ACID

- treat minced meat with lactic acid and compare to Example 1
