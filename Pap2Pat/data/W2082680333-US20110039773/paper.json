    "title": "Identification of a Key Residue Mediating Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-6 Resistance to Noggin Inhibition Allows for Engineered BMPs with Superior Agonist Activity",
    "date": "2010-04-01",
    "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are used clinically to induce new bone formation in spinal fusions and long bone non-union fractures. However, large amounts of BMPs are needed to achieve these effects. BMPs were found to increase the expression of antagonists, which potentially limit their therapeutic efficacy. However, the relative susceptibility of osteoinductive BMPs to different antagonists is not well characterized. Here we show that BMP-6 is more resistant to noggin inhibition and more potent in promoting osteoblast differentiation in vitro and inducing bone regeneration in vivo when compared with its closely related BMP-7 paralog. Noggin was found to play a critical role as a negative feedback regulator of BMP-7 but not BMP-6-induced biological responses. Using BMP-6/7 chimeras, we identified lysine 60 as a key residue conferring noggin resistance within the BMP-6 protein. A remarkable correlation was found between the presence of a lysine at this position and noggin resistance among a panel of osteoinductive BMPs. Introduction of a lysine residue at the corresponding positions of BMP-2 and BMP-7 allowed for molecular engineering of recombinant BMPs with increased resistance to noggin antagonism.",

BMP-7 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the BMP-7 WT construct, using the QuikChange protocol, under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA segments encoding residues 1-40, 45-80, and 90 -120 of the mature BMP-7 domain were replaced by their corresponding regions in BMP-6 to generate three chimeras, 40-1, 80-1, and 90-1, respectively. A PCR-based method was used to generate these chimeras. Briefly, for each chimera, overlapping 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 BMP-7 DNA fragments as well as the middle BMP-6 region were amplified by PCR. DNA plasmids containing the wild type human BMP-7 and BMP-6 open reading frames were used as templates for these PCRs (DNA primers used are available upon request). For each chimera, the three PCR fragments generated in this fashion were subsequently used as a template to amplify a chimeric region spanning the entire mature domain. The assembled chimeric DNA was subsequently substituted for its corresponding BMP-7 wild type sequence, downstream of the pro-domain-encoding region, in the BMP-7 WT construct described above. Four copies of the BMP response element (BRE), as previously described by Korchynskyi and ten Dijke (28), were cloned into TA-Luc (Panomics, Fremont, CA) at the NheI site to generate the BMP reporter construct, BRE 4xR-luc.

The BMP sample was then injected at the indicated concentration, at 75 l/min for 180 s (over both the active and control flow cells), followed by a 300-s undisturbed dissociation phase. For at least one concentration of each sample, the dissociation phase was extended to 1200 s to ensure accurate measurement of slow dissociation constants. Iodination of BMP Ligands and Affinity Labeling of BMP Receptors-Iodination of BMP-6 or BMP-7 was performed according to the choramine T method, and subsequently trans-fected COS cells were affinity-labeled with the radioactive ligand as described previously (8).

BMP-6 induction of downstream genes in primary human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is less susceptible to noggin inhibition than BMP-7. A, in order to compare BMP susceptibility to noggin inhibition, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-2, and BMP-4 were tested by an ALP assay in the ROS cells, in the presence of increasing concentrations of noggin. Each condition was tested in triplicates, and noggin dose-response curves were derived by fitting the data to a non-linear regression. The IC 50 for noggin corresponding to each BMP was then calculated. These results indicate that the four BMPs tested are affected differently by noggin. BMP-4 is the most susceptible, followed by BMP-2, BMP-7, and then BMP-6. Although BMP-4, BMP-2, and BMP-7 are clearly sensitive to noggin inhibition, BMP-6 demonstrated marked resistance to noggin inhibition, with an IC 50 value 4 -16 times higher than that of other BMPs tested. B, BMP-6, but not BMP-7, is resistant to noggin-mediated inhibition. C2C12 cells transfected with BRE-luc reporter were challenged with BMP-6 or BMP-7 in the absence or presence of the indicated amounts of noggin and analyzed for luciferase activity. C, human mesenchymal stem cells were stimulated with BMP-6 or BMP-7, and effects on target genes, including Id-1, Dlx-5, Msx-2, and noggin, were measured by quantitative PCR. Induction of these target genes by BMP-7 was significantly inhibited by noggin in all cases. In particular, noggin inhibits its own induction by BMP-7 to a greater degree than other genes. In contrast, noggin did not affect induction of Id-1, Dlx-5, and noggin transcription induced by BMP-6. Noggin only marginally decreased the induction of Msx-2 by BMP-6.

Interestingly, the dose-response curves for BMP-2 and BMP-4 had shallower slopes compared with those for BMP-5, BMP-6, and BMP-7, suggesting a potentially more pronounced negative regulatory mechanism for BMP-2 and BMP-4. The difference in potency observed between the highly related BMP-6 and BMP-7 (73% amino acid identity) triggered our interest initially. We confirmed this difference in C2C12 myoblasts using both alkaline phosphatase activity and BRE-driven luciferase reporter gene expression as readouts (Fig. 1B). This difference in potency was also confirmed in BMP-treated C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells (data not shown). Importantly, using a critical size defect model of rabbit ulna, we showed that implantation of 100 g of BMP-6, on a bovine collagen sponge, induced faster and more robust bone regeneration as compared with a similar dose of BMP-7 (Fig. 1C). Two weeks following implantation of BMP-6, partial defect bridging with material of non-uniform radiodensity was apparent (Fig. 1C). At the same time point, only flocculent radiodensity with flecks of calcification and no defect bridging was observed in rabbits treated with the 100-g dose of BMP-7. Bone formation, comparable with that induced with BMP-6 (100 g), was found in animals treated with a 5-fold higher dose (500 g) of BMP-7 (Table 1). At 6 weeks postsurgery, BMP-6 induced significantly more bone repair as compared with BMP-7, and by 8 weeks, micro-CT analyses revealed that almost 2 times more bone was formed with BMP-6 as compared with the same amount of BMP-7 (Fig. 1C and Table 1).",
                        "BMP-6 and BMP-7 Induce Noggin Expression with Different Potencies-We next set out to determine the mechanism underlying the differential in vitro and in vivo potency between BMP-6 and BMP-7. Noggin, a natural extracellular BMP inhibitor, has been shown to be induced by BMPs and to antagonize their activity by direct binding and interfering with BMP-BMP receptor interaction (11). To investigate a potential difference in noggin negative feedback regulation of BMP-6 and BMP-7, we initially examined the effect of both BMPs on noggin expression. In C2C12 cells, BMP-7 induced noggin mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B) expression more potently than BMP-6. As a result, we found a more sustained Smad1 phosphorylation in BMP-6-treated C2C12 cells (Fig. 2C) and MC3T3 preosteoblasts (data not shown) compared with BMP-7. Upon siRNA-mediated noggin knockdown, BMP-7-induced Smad1 phosphorylation became more sustained and mimicked the BMP-6-induced response that was also slightly elevated under these conditions (Fig. 2D). Consistent with this result, noggin knockdown also increased BMP-7 effects on downstream effectors, such as BREluciferase reporter gene expression and ALP activity, to BMP-6 levels (Fig. 2, E andF). Taken together, these results indicate that the differential induction of noggin expression by BMPs is a key component of the negative feedback loop regulation of their biological activities.",
                        "BMP-6 Is More Resistant to Noggin Inhibition than BMP-7-In order to compare the susceptibility of BMP-6 and BMP-7 to inhibition by exogenous noggin, both BMPs were tested, along with BMP-2 and BMP-4, for their ability to promote ALP activ-ity in ROS 17/2.8 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of noggin. Of the BMPs tested, BMP-4 was the most sensitive to noggin inhibition, followed by BMP-2 and then BMP-7 (Fig. 3A). BMP-6 demonstrated the highest resistance (IC 50 \u03fe 5,000 ng/ml) to noggin inhibition (Fig. 3A), even compared with its closest homolog BMP-7 (IC 50 \u03ed 800 ng/ml). This differential sensitivity was confirmed using a BRE reporter gene assay in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3B) and A549-BRE cells (data not shown). Similarly, in primary bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells, QPCR analysis showed that BMP-6 induction of the osteoblast marker genes Id-1, Dlx-5, and Msx-2, in addition to noggin, was less susceptible to noggin inhibition compared with BMP-7 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the relative BMP-6 resistance to noggin inhibition is not restricted to a particular cell or assay system but is rather an intrinsic characteristic of BMP-6.",
                        "BMP-6 and BMP-7 have Binding Characteristics Comparable with Those of Immobilized Fc-Noggin Using a Biosensor Assay-One possible explanation for the lower susceptibility to noggin inhibition is that affinity of noggin for BMP-6 is significantly lower than for BMP-7. To test this hypothesis, we profiled the affinity of recombinant noggin on a panel of BMPs, using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Recombinant Fc-noggin protein was immobilized on the Biacore chip surface, and free BMP-2, -4, -6, or -7 was added at various concentrations. BMP binding to Fc-noggin was observed for all four BMPs and was dose-dependent. Noggin bound with the highest affinity to BMP-4 (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, in this experimental paradigm, BMP-6 apparent affinity to noggin (K D \u03ed 1.3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea11 M) was higher than that of BMP-7 (K D \u03ed 1.8 \u03eb 10 \u03ea10 M) (Fig. 4). This paradoxical result was in conflict with the functional data presented in Fig. 3. Interestingly, close analysis of the biosensor data showed that this apparent higher affinity for BMP-6 is driven mainly by its apparent low dissociation rate (K d of 6 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 s \u03ea1 for BMP-6 compared with 1 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 s \u03ea1 for BMP-7). In fact, the dissociation rate observed for all ligands in this experiment was unusually low. In contrast, the on-rate for BMP-6 was slightly lower than that of BMP-7 (K a of 4.7 \u03eb 10 6 FIGURE 5. Noggin inhibits BMP-7 but not BMP-6 binding to BMP receptors. The indicated BMP receptors were transfected into COS cells and affinity-labeled by cross-linking with radiolabeled BMP-6 or BMP-7 in the absence or presence of noggin. Affinity-labeled BMP-BMP receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell extracts with ALK2-or ALK6-specific antibodies. Samples were washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and scanned with the STORM imaging system (Amersham Biosciences).

Moreover, at comparable concentrations, more BMP-7 was bound to Fc-noggin compared with BMP-6, as judged by the response units measured by the instrument (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the binding characteristics of BMP-6 and BMP-7 to immobilized Fc-noggin fusion protein are significantly different.",
                        "Noggin Inhibition of BMP Binding to Cell Surface BMP Receptors Is More Pronounced in the Case of BMP-6 Compared with BMP-7-In order to further validate the functional data presented in Fig. 3 and to investigate noggin interactions with BMP-6 and BMP-7 using an alternative method to Biacore, we measured the effect of noggin on the binding of BMP-6 or BMP-7 to cell surface BMP type I and type II receptors. To accomplish this, we overexpressed BMPR-II on the surface of COS cells, in conjunction with either BMP type I receptor FIGURE 6. Identification of region in BMP-6 that is responsible for increased resistance to noggin inhibition. A, alignment of BMP-6 and BMP-7 mature domains. Shared amino acid residues are shaded. B, schematic representation of BMP-6 (shaded), BMP-7 (black), and BMP-6/7 chimeras. C, the chimera 80-1 is as resistant to noggin inhibition as BMP-6. D, the sensitivity of purified recombinant 80-1 chimera to noggin inhibition is comparable with that of BMP-6. 80-1 chimera was purified from the conditioned medium of transfected HEK 293 cells, and BMP-7 and BMP-6 were purified from stable Chinese hamster ovary expressing cell lines. A549-BRE cells were challenged with either BMP-6, BMP-7, or 80-1 proteins in the presence of increasing concentrations of noggin. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-BMP treatment, and the percentage inhibition was calculated for each noggin concentration. expressed by transient transfection in HEK293T cells and secreted in the conditioned medium (supplemental Fig. 1B). The susceptibility of each of these BMP-7 mutants to noggin inhibition was tested as described above for the revertant proteins. Of the BMP-7 mutants tested, E60K was significantly more resistant to noggin compared with wild type, whereas Y65N had a marginal effect (Fig. 7C; only data for the highest noggin concentration is shown). A triple mutant BMP-7 protein, R48Q/E60K/Y65N, was also generated and was not significantly more resistant to noggin when compared with E60K (Fig. 7C). These results further support the finding that Lys 60 plays a major role in mediating noggin resistance in BMP-6."

Interestingly, side by side comparison of the sensitivity of purified recombinant BMP-2, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-9, and BMP-7 E60K proteins to noggin (Fig. 8B) revealed that BMP-9 is also highly resistant to noggin inhibition. This finding is in agreement with the recent finding by Rosen (33). Moreover, these data confirm the increased resistance of BMP-7 E60K protein to noggin inhibition because a purified form of this protein was used rather the conditioned medium from transfected cells. BMP amino acid sequence alignment also showed that a proline residue is found at the corresponding Lys 60 position in BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Fig. 8A). This prompted us to test if a proline to lysine mutation at this position in BMP-2 (BMP-2 P36K) could yield a BMP-2 variant with increased noggin resistance. Such a mutant BMP-2 was generated and tested for noggin resistance. As expected, this BMP-2 variant demonstrated a significant increase in noggin resistance compared with its wild type counterpart, although the magnitude of effect was less pronounced than in the case of BMP-7 (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these data suggest that the function of BMP-6 lysine 60 in mediating noggin resistance can be transferred to other BMPs, making them more resistant to this BMP antagonist."

                "Recombinant human BMP-2 and BMP-7 proteins have been used clinically for many years to induce new bone formation in spinal fusion (34) and long bone non-union fractures (26,35). Despite their safety and clinical efficacy, these proteins still have significant shortcomings (36). The most intriguing of these are the relatively high doses of BMPs needed to achieve clinical success. We postulated that the strong negative feedback loop mechanisms built into the biology of these growth factors play a major role in attenuating their function following surgical implantation.

                "Here we show that although BMP-6 and BMP-7 are highly similar, BMP-6 is more potent in inducing osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vivo. We postulate that a key underlying mechanism for this differential response could be that noggin is more effective as a negative regulator for BMP-7 than for BMP-6. Although BMP-7 induces noggin expression more potently than BMP-6, BMP-6 is more resistant to noggin inhibition than BMP-7. Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of noggin sustains BMP-7-induced Smad phosphorylation and cellular differentiation responses at levels similar to BMP-6.",
                "Importantly, we identified a single amino acid in BMP-6 that modulates its susceptibility to noggin inhibition. We show a strong correlation between BMP resistance to noggin inhibition and the presence of a lysine residue at position 60 of the mature domain (BMP-6 numbering). Amino acid sequence alignment of mature BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, and -15 reveals that, in addition to BMP-6 and BMP-9, BMP-11 also has a lysine at this position (data not shown). Our data suggest that it is possible to engineer BMP variants with increased noggin resistance by substituting a lysine for the corresponding residue at position 60. This feature, if combined with others that enhance BMP specificity, stability, and safety, could allow the development of more effective recombinant BMPs in the future.",
                "The crystal structures of BMP-7 (37) and BMP-6 (31, 38) mature domains have both been solved. Despite their remarkable similarities, the overlay of these two structures reveals significant differences at the tips of finger 1 and finger 2 (Fig. 9A). Fingers 1 and 2 mediate BMP binding to both type I and type II BMP receptors. In the case of BMP-7, fingers 1 and 2 are more extended. Moreover, in BMP-6, Lys 60 and Asn 65 form intramolecular hydrogen bonds between fingers 1 and 2, thus increasing the overall rigidity of the molecule. These interactions are missing in BMP-7, making it more flexible than BMP-6. Interestingly, BMP-7 Glu 60 resides at the tip of finger 1. This region undergoes significant conformational change upon binding to noggin (Fig. 9B). In the noggin-bound conformation, Glu 60 forms an intramolecular salt bridge with Arg 48 and interacts with noggin Phe 54 (Fig. 9C). BMP-7 Glu 60 and Arg 48 also engage in direct interactions with type II BMP receptors (Fig. 9D). This interaction is preserved in BMP-6 despite the presence of lysine at position 60. Our functional cell-based studies clearly demonstrate that BMP-6 binding to cell surface receptors is less susceptible to noggin compared with BMP-7. One possible explanation for this difference is that BMP receptors might displace BMP-6 from noggin more efficiently than in the case of the BMP-7-noggin complex. This is supported by the observation that BMP-6 is more rigid than BMP-7 and thus may not undergo as much of a conformational change when bound to noggin, making the complex more unstable in the presence of cell surface receptors. Solving the BMP-6-noggin and BMP-6-BMP receptor ternary complex crystal structures could provide additional insight into the differential mechanisms of BMP-7 and BMP-6 inhibition by noggin.",
                "In conclusion, a key determinant for the increased potency of BMP-6 compared with BMP-7 is the lower sensitivity of BMP-6 to noggin-mediated inhibition. Identification of Lys 60 in BMP-6 that confers noggin resistance allowed us to generate BMPs with superior agonistic activity that hold promise for future clinical benefit."
