# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate materials science

## BRIEF SUMMARY

- outline microtexture analysis method

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce microtextured regions analysis
- collect orientation information from sample
- organize orientation information into tiles
- perform texture processing on each tile
- compute Generalized Spherical Harmonic expansion
- perform clustering in orientation space
- map clustering results back to real space
- perform spatial filtering and macrozone identification
- calculate microstructure metrics and n-point statistics
- store data in long-term storage and archival system
- perform quality control and data mining operations
- use n-point correlations to define common language for analyzing materials

### Example

- illustrate method to identify conforming materials
- describe cluster analysis and PCA space
- explain application of method for quality control
- outline steps for analyzing EBSD data
- discuss computer program product and system embodiments
