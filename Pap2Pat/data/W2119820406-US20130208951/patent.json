    "date": "2013-02-07 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The identification and quantification of microtextured regions in orientation datasets is provided through the use of microstructure informatics based on n-point correlation functions, dimensionality reduction techniques, and a computer algebra system. Orientation information is extracted for materials and processing is performed on the orientation information along with other ancillary data that accompanies each piece of orientation information and a hybrid descriptor of orientation is formed. Representative descriptors are identified such that regions of microtexture are classified. This classification is mapped back onto the real space of the sample and a local clustering is done to identify continuous regions of microtexture. These labeled continuous regions of microtexture then provide a method for segmentation of the orientation data into their respective macrozones.",

The analysis comprises obtaining crystallographic orientation information from a sample of a material under evaluation and performing texture processing of the collected orientation information by generating hybrid descriptors, each hybrid descriptor comprising texture information and non-texture information extracted from associated orientation information. The analysis further comprises clustering the hybrid descriptors to produce orientation clusters where each orientation cluster corresponds to a dominant zone of microtexture.

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "According to various aspects of the present disclosure, the analysis (e.g., the quantification, identification or both the quantification and identification) of microtextured regions (also referred to herein as macrozones) in materials with ordered crystal structure is carried out according to one or more approaches set out herein.",
                        "In general, an approach to analyzing microtextured regions described more fully herein is to collect a plurality of individual measurements of orientation information (in real space, i.e., spatial location on the sample) from a sample under evaluation using an orientation measurement device. The measurements are logically organized into a plurality of \u201ctiles\u201d such that each tile includes a number of measurements. Thus conceptually, each measurement can be represented as a \u201cpixel\u201d in a corresponding tile. Each measurement (in whatever form is provided by the particular orientation measurement technology) is mapped to a structure that allows subsequent processing, referred to herein generally for sake of discussion as an \u201corientation matrix\u201d. Thus, there is an orientation matrix for each pixel of each tile.",
                        "For every tile, the Generalized Spherical Harmonic (GSH) expansion is computed from the corresponding orientation matrices, which transforms the measurements to an \u201corientation space\u201d. This process is repeated for each tile individually, thus providing an efficient additive process. This process is generally referred to as \u201ctexture processing\u201d. Once the GSH coefficients are calculated, a clustering process is performed in the orientation space to produce orientation clusters and the results of the clustering process (orientation clusters) are mapped back to their respective locations in the real space. Additionally, clustering process may comprise color coding, filtering and performing other cleanup processes as described more fully herein.",
                        "Overall Flow Diagram:",
                        "Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to FIG. 1, a flow diagram 100 illustrates a process for analyzing (e.g., identifying, quantifying, etc.) microtextured regions in materials with an ordered crystal structure, according to aspects of the present disclosure.",
                        "The process obtains crystallographic orientation information from a sample of a material under evaluation at 102. The orientation information may be derived from an existing data set, or the orientation information can be extracted from the sample under evaluation using an orientation measurement device.",
                        "For instance, where a material is available for evaluation, a sample of the material (i.e., material sample) having an ordered crystal structure is examined to collect crystallographic orientation information. As a few illustrative examples, the orientation information of the material under evaluation can be collected using an orientation measurement device that implements Electron Backscatter Diffraction (i.e., EBSD), Spatially Resolved Acoustic Spectroscopy (i.e. SRAS), Ultrasonic orientation characterization techniques, X-ray, or other approaches that measure physical properties of the sample material so as to infer or result in orientation state.",
                        "The orientation information obtained from the material sample is characterized in either sub-regions (i.e., \u201ctiles\u201d) of a large area, or a large area is characterized and then split into tiles (i.e., sub-regions of the large area). Regardless, the orientation information is arranged into tiles that correspond to associated spatial locations of the sample. The tiles may contain information of one or more arbitrary dimensions (i.e. n-dimensions where n is any integer greater than 0). However, at least one of those dimensions should contain data about a location specific crystallographic orientation state (e.g. Euler angles, Rodrigues vector, Orientation matrix, etc). The collection of information about the orientation state at multiple locations is then regarded as the texture.",
                        "Texture processing is performed at 104. In this regard, the tile processing discussed above may be implemented as a separate process (such as may be implemented before texture processing) or the above-tile processing may be implemented as part of the texture processing at 104.",
                        "As noted above, each measurement (in whatever form is provided by the particular orientation measurement technology) is mapped to a corresponding orientation matrix. Thus, there is an orientation matrix for each pixel of each tile. For every tile, the Generalized Spherical Harmonic (GSH) expansion is computed from the corresponding orientation matrices, which transforms the measurements to an \u201corientation space\u201d. For instance, in an illustrative implementation, data from each tile is processed such that \u201ctexture information\u201d along with non-texture information (e.g., information about the quality and pedigree of the corresponding data, etc.), form a hybrid descriptor that is able to discern, for instance, the relevance of a given data point in relation to belonging to a calculated zone of microtexture.",
                        "As an illustrative example, the orientation information may be extracted from the material sample at 102 using EBSD. The texture processing at 104 may then be performed by computing the Generalized Spherical Harmonic (GSH) expansion on the orientation information. Regardless of the means to collect the orientation information, texture processing at 104 comprises obtaining the symmetries as point-group operators, which are either given directly or solved for, for both the crystal symmetry and the sample symmetry. A computer algebra system (CAS) then solves for values (e.g., one per symmetry operator and rotational parameter) such that point-group operators can be applied through additive values to a given rotation to produce equivalent rotations with respect to the quotient space. The CAS then finds the linear combination of the additive values applied to the underlying basis function that produces the same values under all given symmetries. This linear combination of basis functions yields a closed form solution for a given bandwidth of the D-Wigner function.",
                        "Optimizations (e.g., constant folding and constant propagation) may then be performed by the CAS such that the number of operations required to evaluate the resulting closed form solution is minimized. Moreover, the resulting expression can be translated into program text for the target programming language (e.g., Fortran, Matlab, C, etc.). The generation of these computer codes represents a one-time cost; the generated computer code is used from that point forward to compute the compact representations of functions over the Special Orthogonal group SO(n).",
                        "The hybrid descriptors are inputted into a clustering device at 106. The clustering device outputs dominant zones of microtexture (also referred to herein as orientation clusters). In an illustrative implementation, a k-means clustering algorithm is used to find the most likely representative hybrid orientation descriptor such that the inner-class mean to the class centroids are minimized. However, in general, any methodology, algorithm, or combination of methodologies which provides a mapping from orientation descriptor to class label could be used in the place of the k-means clustering, which is discussed only as an example.",
                        "Additional cleanup may also be implemented, e.g., to remove regions which are identified as belonging to a macrozone, but yet are not on the required length scale. Cleanup may be implemented by mapping orientation clusters to real space at 108, performing spatial filtering at 110, performing macrozone identification at 112, or combinations thereof.",
                        "The orientation clusters are mapped to real space at 108. In an exemplary implementation, the dominant zones of microtexture output by the clustering device at 106 are spatially resolved at 108, back on to the original, corresponding spatial location in the sample. The orientation clusters are mapped back to the tiles and back to the original coordinate system from which they were collected.",
                        "Spatial filtering is performed at 110. Keeping with the above-exemplary implementation, local, spatial filtering is performed such that continuous regions of similar zones of microtexture are identified. Zones of microtexture are characterized by a representative orientation descriptor or collection of descriptors. In an illustrative implementation, data points that either do not belong to a coherent zone of microtexture or are of low quality are then labeled as outliers. In this instance a local voting scheme can be used to decide which zone of microtexture a given location belonged to in the case that there are multiple adjacent zones of microtexture.",
                        "A macrozone identification process can be performed at 112 to identify macrozones in the orientation descriptors. An example of identifying macrozones is set out in greater detail herein in the discussion of FIG. 4.",
                        "These representative orientation descriptors or collection of descriptors are used as input to microstructure metrics calculations. The microstructure metrics calculations can be utilized, for instance, to relate the characteristics of the zones of microtexture to performance parameters or processing paths.",
                        "Moreover, according to further aspects of the present disclosure, a graphical presentation of orientation information of multiple datasets is implemented by plotting Inverse pole figure (IPF) maps at 114. For instance, IPF maps can be generated for each individual dataset (i.e., tile). The images of the IPF maps can then be into one image or multiple images.",
                        "Further, higher-order statistics can be processed at 116. In an illustrative example, macrozones identified at 112 are obtained and metrics on the macrozones are computed, including n-point statistics (e.g. 2-point statistics). The n-point statistics are applied to analyze the material under test. In this regard, the data can be expressed as a continuous function, i.e., a vector having a size the same as the image size. Thus, an m\u00d7m pixel image has an m2 dimension space (also referred to herein generally as n-point). By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, a 200\u00d7200 pixel image has 40,000 2-point statistics. By expanding out to a 40,000 dimension space, the image reduces to a single point. By obtaining a plurality of different data sets, each data set having the same dimensions (40,000 in this example), and by plotting each data set as a single point in space, trend analysis can be performed.",
                        "The overall texture of the sample is then partitioned into the orientation descriptors that comprise each zone of microtexture at 118. This allows an investigator to compute or derive information on regions of microtexture that they would normally perform on the level of the whole sample. In the case of EBSD, an exemplary but not limiting case would be computing texture distributions (e.g., pole figures or orientation distribution functions (ODF)).",
                        "According to still further aspects of the present disclosure, the obtained data, including the microstructure metrics, n-point information, etc., are stored in a long-term data storage and archival system for subsequent use at 120. The stored information can be retrieved for performing quality control at 122. For instance, microstructure metrics can be retrieved from storage for comparison across different data sets and samples. This allows, as an example, an engineer to make decisions about quality control of thermo-mechanical processing.",
                        "As another example, the data stored in the database at 120 can be evaluated for various data mining operations at 124. More particularly, according to still further aspects of the present invention, n-point information is stored, mapped, processed, searched and/or otherwise manipulated to perform analysis of orientation information. As an illustrative example, EBSD is utilized to calculate the crystallographic orientations of crystalline materials, e.g., to study materials with ordered crystal structure, such as titanium. Based upon the collected information, orientation data is extracted and n-point correlations (n=2,3,4 etc.) are then used to analyze the linkages of the microstructure to the properties of the material.",
                        "According to yet a further aspect of the present disclosure, n-point correlations are used to define a common language for analyzing materials. In this regard, the n-point correlations can serve as a \u201cbarcode\u201d to embed metadata that can be later recovered to identify information about the sample under evaluation, e.g., to embed information such as a source of the material, date of test, batch identifier, location or any other useful information.",
                        "As an illustrative, but not limiting example, reference is made to FIGS. 2A-2D. In this example, the c-axis (e.g. [0001] is the direction normal to the basal plane in the hcp titanium) is used as the primary orientation descriptor and the direction of the c-axis is mapped on to a color using a stereographic projection. Three illustrative individual zones of microtexture are identified using the above methods and are segmented into the images seen in FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C, respectively. More particularly, an exemplary first segmented macrozone 202 is illustrated in FIG. 2A. An exemplary second segmented macrozone 204 is illustrated in FIG. 2B. An exemplary third segmented macrozone 206 is illustrated in FIG. 2C. FIG. 2D illustrates a c-axis map (herein is referred to it as C-Map) 208 that has been stitched together from corresponding tiles, as described more fully herein. Similarly, C-Maps can be plotted for the clustered C-coefficients of the GSH in 108 above.",
                        "Orientation Information",
                        "Referring to FIG. 3, a method 300 is illustrated to process orientation information. The method 300 may be utilized, for instance, to perform texture processing at 104 and/or other processing of the orientation information collected at 102 of FIG. 1. According to various aspects of the present disclosure, starting data of orientation information is mapped at 302 to discrete spatial locations. The starting data of orientation information is organized at 304. For instance, the orientation information can be arranged in one dataset or multiple datasets (i.e., tiles). For each individual dataset (tile), each spatial location may contain the crystallographic orientation, local chemistry, phase, or any other information collected or added during or after data collection. In a non-limiting but illustrative example, a sample may produce 1,000 tiles, each tile containing data for 1,000,000 spatial points or more. Moreover, each data point may contain multiple individual pieces of information, e.g., 10-20 pieces of information.",
                        "Orientation information is extracted at 306, e.g., for each location, i.e., from individual tiles. Thus, the process works on tiles individually, thus providing a computationally efficient process compared to processing all orientation information measurements as a single, large dataset. In an exemplary implementation, a view of the orientation of the crystal structure is defined. For instance, a sample material can be probed to see the orientation of grains. By knowing grain orientation in space, one can get a sense of the material and look at its \u201ctexture\u201d, i.e., preferred orientation. An approach to look at texture is to consider the average of the orientation of crystals in space. Thus, in an illustrative implementation, Euler angles are used to determine orientation, and thus \u201ctexture\u201d information. In the case of EBSD data, an orientation distribution function (ODF) is determined. The ODF is a continuous function that represents texture.",
                        "According to further aspects of the present disclosure, in an exemplary case of EBSD texture information, a graphical representation of orientation information of multiple datasets is accomplished by plotting an Inverse Pole Figure (IPF) map for each individual dataset (tile). The resultant IPF image maps (metadata) are stitched into one image or multiple images. This method enables the analysis of large datasets in a short computational timeframe.",
                        "For instance, by taking a plurality of EBSD scans, e.g., 1,000 or more scans, and stitching the image data together (not the underlying data), a dataset is provided that allows computationally efficient zooming in and out of the data to expedite data analysis. In this regard, by stitching tiles together, granularity can be coarsened to large scale or focused to small scale by zooming in on the image data without the computational burden of the underlying data. That is, the image data is stitched, not the underlying data. This produces an efficient way to manage data. In the case where data was collected as a single region, the single region can be efficiently dealt with in an analogous manner, e.g., by dividing the single region into regular sub-regions (tiles) and applying the above-described technique.",
                        "A harmonic function is used to capture grain orientations at 308, e.g., in the case of EBSD data, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Other functional representations can be used for other cases up to and including the use of primitive basis functions. In an illustrative implementation, for each dataset, the generalized spherical harmonic (GSH) expansion of each crystallographic orientation is computed. Notably, conventional processing can take a considerable amount of time, even to process a single tile. However, according to aspects of the present disclosure, numerical interpolation is used to capture generalized spherical harmonic coefficients. By way of illustration and not by way of limitation, a database is constructed of all textures. A numerical analysis is used to calculate the GSH coefficients of the textures captured in the database. This numerical approach can speed up processing significantly over a process that computes the GSH per tile.",
                        "According to further aspects of the present disclosure, texture information for the overall dataset or subsets can be calculated directly by plotting standard Pole figure or Orientation Distribution Functions from the Generalized Spherical Harmonics.",
                        "As another illustrative example, the GSH can be computed using closed-form analytical solutions, for the basis function of a limited bandwidth as computed by a CAS (Computer Algebra System), examples of which are described above with reference to FIG. 1. Moreover, each expansion is optimized to reduce the number of expressions evaluated. Expansion optimization is carried out in one illustrative exemplary implementation by using compiler-like optimization techniques. In an exemplary implementation, as a result of the technique set out above, an order of magnitude savings was observed in the CPU time (i.e., time for which a central processing unit was used) that was required to compute the basis functions of an arbitrary orientation compared to computing these basis functions using an intermediate Fourier basis.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 4, a method 400 is provided to identify microtextured regions (macrozones). This process may be utilized for instance, to implement the macrozone identification 112 of FIG. 1. Discrete orientation data, e.g., the output of the method 300, is segmented at 402. As an example, discrete orientation data from EBSD is segmented into different classifications by using an algorithm which assigns a classification based error-minimization with respect to a parametric probability distribution. In addition to the discrete orientation data, information about the reliability (or quality) of the extracted orientation data and the accuracy (or confidence) of indexing them is taken into account in the classification algorithm, and data points which are below a preset threshold are excluded in the classification process.",
                        "The graphical presentation of segmented microtextured regions (macrozones) is accomplished, for instance, by plotting the C-Map at 404. In an illustrative implementation, the C-Map is plotted in which the square of cosine angles between the crystallographic crystal direction of interest (e.g., basal pole for hcp titanium) and the sample coordinate axes (e.g. reference direction (RD), transverse direction (TD), and normal direction (ND)) is plotted.",
                        "Each classification (cluster) is assigned a code, e.g., a color, in the C-Map at 406. Thus, the C-Map is color-coded. For instance, in an illustrative implementation, for visual identification of individual macrozones that were segmented, each classification (cluster) is assigned a color (or fill, pattern or other distinguishable characteristic) at 406 in the C-Map. The coloring of the C-Map may be associated to a key color map with continuous gradient of colors for each possible value of cosine squares (0-1). As such, the color coding is based upon orientation information.",
                        "As noted above, higher-order statistics, (e.g., 116 of FIG. 1), may be performed. For instance, each classification of macrozones is quantified at 408. To quantify each classification of macrozones at 408, C-Maps for each classification of macrozone are plotted. From the C-Maps of each classification, the n-point statistics are calculated and the chord-length distributions are calculated. Building a database of various datasets collected from various samples, the n-point correlations of individual C-Maps (or any other segmented data) are analyzed via data mining procedures at 410.",
                        "In an exemplary implementation, the n-point correlations of individual C-Maps (or any other segmented data) are analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Various datasets from various samples with statistically related features clusters in PCA space. In general, this technique can be used with any clustering analysis algorithm (e.g., Support vector machines (SVM), Independent component analysis, or Manifold learning, etc).",
                        "The above technique can be used as a quality control database (e.g., to perform quality control 122 of FIG. 1). As an illustrative example, in the identification of titanium alloys produced by various processing methodologies, the distance in PCA space between a given sample and a preselected standard sample can establish how similar the processing history and performance are between the given sample and the standard sample.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 5, a method 500 is provided, according to various aspects of the present disclosure, to use the C-coefficients of the GSH to provide insight into the material under analysis. In an illustrative implementation, the data is clustered at 502 around the C-coefficients to define a new mapping. By clustering in the C-space, the user looks at clustering along an axis of interest. By plotting clustered data in real space (e.g., the sample surface) at 504, various metrics can be extracted from clustered regions, e.g., by plotting chord-length distributions at 506 along all possible sample directions. The general idea is that the chords should lie inside the clustered region and touching the boundaries. Chord-length distribution is then used to measure information about the dimensions of clusters in the C-Maps at 508, e.g., to determine aspect ratio, spatial separation, size etc. Notably, chord-length distribution is possible in a single sample direction and/or all possible sample directions in 360 degrees.",
                        "For example, when analyzing a titanium microstructure with macrozones, a user may be interested in the c-axes of the crystal structure of the titanium sample. As such the data is clustered in the C-space of the GSH and the data is then mapped into the real space (e.g., sample coordinates). Based upon these clusters, an n-point (n=2, 3, etc) correlation is then performed on the identified clusters (macrozones). For example, the 2-point statistics are used to analyze the image and find the probability of a vector head and tail to fall on the same feature (i.e. macrozone).",
                        "According to various aspects of the present disclosure, machine learning is used to identify features of interest in the sample of interest, e.g., the sample of titanium. In this regard, features may not consistently be in the same place within a pattern, have the same shape or same orientation, even across different locations of the same sample material.",
                        "As yet another illustrative example, the n-point correlations are analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For instance, using Principle Component Analysis, the direction of the most scattering of the data is defined as the first principle direction. The direction orthogonal to the first principle direction defines a second principle direction, and a third principle direction is orthogonal to the first and second principle directions. Various datasets from various samples with statistically related features cluster in PCA space. For example, the gray hull in FIG. 7. As yet another illustrative example, the n-point correlations are analyzed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) space.

                                "Referring to FIG. 6, a method 600 is illustrated to identify material that is conforming to preselected standard procedure(s) (e.g. thermo-mechanical processing) vs. materials that do not conform to the standard procedures. The method 600 comprises implementing a training process at 602 that includes collecting a plurality of datasets (e.g., EBSD datasets) at 604 that are from known conforming materials. All datasets are analyzed per the procedures mentioned above and explained with reference to FIGS. 1-5, including the computation of n-point correlations at 606. The method 600 further comprises implementing a sample validation process at 608. The sample validation process 608 comprises collecting a dataset from a new sample at 610 and analyzing the new dataset per the procedures mentioned above and explained with reference to FIGS. 1-5, including the computation of n-point correlations at 612.",
                                "Cluster analysis is then used to look at all datasets at 614. For instance, the method 600 may comprise calculating the 2-point correlations at 606 and 612 of the microstructure features (e.g. macrozones) in the datasets collected at 604 and 610, and by plotting the 2-point statistics as a single point in the PCA space at 614. Based upon an identification of where the sample under investigation, 610, lies in the PCA space relative to the defined requirements, e.g., known conforming points, observations and predictions can be drawn at 616 about whether the sample under investigation is conforming or non-conforming. FIG. 7 shows an example of how this process is used for a quality control application.",
                                "Notably, in illustrative implementations, there is no need to manually identify bounds on conforming or non-conforming determinations. In PCA space, all datasets that belong to conforming material happen to cluster together. As such, anything within the cluster will be conforming. All datasets that do not conform to standards do not fall within the conforming hull of the cluster. As such, anything outside the conforming hull (cluster) will be non-conforming. This allows an automatic process to perform the evaluation.",
                                "For instance, referring to FIG. 7, for exemplary datasets, the 2-point correlations of the macrozones from multiple ground truth samples are shown in PCA space. The solid circles represent ground truth samples that fall within a conforming material hull. Additionally, the 2-point correlations of macrozones of the test sample are shown in PCA space, which is illustrated by an asterisk. Note that, in this illustrative example, the data for the new sample falls outside the ground truth sample (i.e. confirming material to preset standard) and is thus non-conforming material because the new sample is outside the hull.",
                                "Thus, the 2-point correlation of various microstructural features in the PCA space can be used to distinguish conforming vs. nonconforming titanium. By collecting a plurality of datasets that are from known conforming titanium batch, PCA analysis can be used to look at an unknown sample by calculating the 2-point statistic of a microstructure feature (e.g. macrozones) in the sample dataset, and by plotting the 2-point statistics as a single point in the PCA space. Based upon an identification of where the sample under investigation lies in the PCA space relative to the known conforming points and hull, observations and predictions can be drawn about whether the sample under investigation is conforming or non-conforming titanium.",

                                "Using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), scans of large areas are necessary to capture macro-heterogeneities while high resolution is necessary for capturing micro-heterogeneities.
