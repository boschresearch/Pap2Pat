# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates permanent magnets, and more particularly, this invention relates to YCo5-based magnets.

## BACKGROUND

Among the great challenges of materials science is discovering a material that satisfies conflicting requirements and also possesses specific properties for a particular application. There is a need for strong permanent magnets to withstand higher temperatures, for example Curie temperatures ranging from 800 K to 1200 K, which the widely used neodymium-based magnets (Nd2Fe14B, Neomax®) cannot tolerate. Pure Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo) magnets (both SmCo5 and Sm2Co17) satisfy this requirement and are less subject to corrosion than the neodymium-based magnets and thus do not require a coating. Moreover, pure SmCo magnets have strong resistance to demagnetization.

Three basic material parameters determine the intrinsic properties of hard magnetic materials: (i) spontaneous (saturation) magnetization, (Ms), (ii) Curie temperature (Tc), and (iii) magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). An optimal technological permanent magnet has a large spontaneous magnetization (Ms≥˜1 MA), high Curie temperature (Tc≥˜550 K), and large MAE constant (K1≥˜4 MJ/m3).

Pure YCo5 permanent magnets exhibit high uniaxial MAE constant of K1˜6.5 MJ/m3, which is excessive compared to that of Nd2Fe14B magnets having MAE with a K1 of ˜4.9 MJ/m3. YCo5 permanent magnets have high Curie temperature, Tc˜987 K, which is almost twice that of Nd2Fe14B magnets having Curie temperature, Tc˜588 K. However, the Nd2Fe14B magnet currently dominates the world market for permanent magnets (˜62% of world market), since the Nd2Fe14B magnet has large spontaneous magnetization and possesses the highest energy performance measured by a record high energy product. The Maximum Energy Product (BH)max of the Nd2Fe14B magnet at 512 kJ/m3 is more than twice as high as the (BH)max of YCo5 magnets, at 224 kJ/m3.

It would be desirable to formulate a permanent magnet with a greater spontaneous magnetization, high MAE and thermostability comparable to YCo5 magnets while having a high Curie temperature.

According to various inventive concepts described herein, a permanent magnet may be formed that has a high spontaneous magnetization, thermostability, high Curie temperatures and high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Ideally, transition-metal dopants may boost the energy product of YCo5 magnets without compromising the high MAE and high Curie temperatures of these magnets. For example, combining transition-metal (TM) with rare-earth-metal (RE) atoms in various intermetallic compounds may result in material in which RE and TM atoms induce a large magnetic anisotropy and provide a large magnetization and high Curie temperature.

Iron (Fe) is more readily available than cobalt (Co) such that Fe is ˜2000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust than Co. Thus, at least from a cost standpoint, it would be beneficial to substitute Co atoms in YCo5 with Fe atoms since the relative abundance of available Fe could result in a less expensive component. In addition, Fe may be desirable as an added component to a magnet material since its ferromagnetic metal properties have a large magnetization at room temperature (1.76 MA/m).

FIG. 1 depicts a structure 100 of a material of a magnet, in accordance with inventive concepts described herein. As an option, the present structure 100 may be implemented in conjunction with features from any other inventive concepts listed herein, such as those described with reference to the other FIGS. Of course, however, such structure 100 and others presented herein may be used in various applications and/or in permutations which may or may not be specifically described in the illustrative concepts listed herein. Further, the structure 100 presented herein may be used in any desired environment.

As shown in FIG. 1, the crystal structure of a CaCu5(D2d)-type Structure 100 with three distinct atoms displayed, may represent a YCo5 compound crystal structure in accordance with some approaches. An yttrium atom (Y1) may be in the Wyckoff position 1a 102 centered in a plane with two Co1 atoms in the position 2c 104 surrounding the Y1 in the position 1a 102 and a second layer with three more Co2 atoms in the position 3g 106 for a total of six atoms in the unit cell. Bonding and energy between the atoms of a crystal structure may be defined by the interactions between 3d-orbital electrons of the transition metals in the position 2c 104 or position 3g 106 and the 5d-orbital electrons from yttrium (Y1) in the center position 1a 102 as shown in FIG. 1.

In the YFe5 compound that only includes Fe atoms without any Co atoms, the instability of the crystal structure may be related to a decrease in the number of 3d electrons in the electronic structure. Indeed, crystal stabilities of the magnetic 3d transition metals may be governed by the number of 3d electrons.

Thus, substituting all cobalt atoms with a transition metal with higher magnetic moment, such as iron, in order to optimize the maximum energy product (i.e., YCo5→YFe5) may result in a thermodynamically unstable crystal structure of an ordinary hexagonal phase. Moreover, YFe5 does not appear in the equilibrium Y—Fe phase diagram, although the alloy compound Y(Co1-xFex)5 with CaCu5-type structure has been synthesized for x=0.2 to 0.4.

For synthesized Y(Co1-xFex)5 materials, the Curie temperatures (Tc) for Y(Co1-xFex)5 alloys were found to increase from about 930 K to about 1020 K when increasing x from 0.0 to 0.2. In contrast, Y2(Co1-xFex)17 alloys exhibit a monotonic decrease in Curie temperature (Tc) with increasing Fe content. The orbital moment of cobalt is larger compared to iron, and a decrease of the MAE occurs for x>0. The lattice constant and magnetization are enhanced for x=0 to 0.4 in Y(Co1-xFex)5 alloys.

Accordingly, the inventive concepts presented herein, in several embodiments, involve ab initio calculations to add nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) to a YCo5 magnet in order to stabilize Y(Co—Fe—Ni)5 alloys containing a sufficient amount of Fe to boost the energy product of the Y(Co—Fe—Ni)5 magnet.

In accordance with inventive concepts described herein, a magnet includes a material having a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, wherein x may be greater than 0 and x may be less than 1. In some approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x may be greater than 1−x such that the compound has a greater amount of Co compared to Ni. Accordingly, x may be a value between 0.5 and 1, such as 0.51, 0.52 . . . 0.98, 0.99. In other approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x may be less than 1−x, such that the compound has a greater amount of Ni compared to Co. Accordingly, x may be a value between 0 and 0.5, such as 0.01, 0.02 . . . 0.48, 0.49. Preferably, whether x is greater than or less than 1−x, the values are within a 10% difference of one another, e.g., x is a value in a range of 0.45-0.55. In preferred approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x is about equal to 1−x.

In at least one contemplated approach, in addition to iron and nickel, copper may be used to dope the YCo5 magnets as described herein. In contrast to the Y(Co1-xFex)5 system, Y(Co1-xNix)5 and Y(Co1-xCux)5 compounds are stable across the composition domain comprising x=0 to 1. Substituting cobalt atoms with nickel and/or copper atoms gradually decreases magnetization and magnetic anisotropy.

Preferably, the magnet as described in the inventive concepts herein includes a lower (e.g., reduced) amount of cobalt (up to 75% less Co) than the amount of Co in YCo5. Moreover, the magnet as described may be a permanent magnet.

The magnet compound of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 material as described herein may have a CaCu5-type crystal structure. Referring again to FIG. 1, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may form a hexagonal CaCu5-type structure 100: Y1 in position 1a 102, Co atoms, Fe atoms, and Ni atoms sharing transition metal position 2c 104 sites and position 3g 106 non-equivalent atomic sites with 6 atoms per formula unit. In at least one exemplary aspect, Fe atoms occupy all 3g 106 positions of the CaCu5-type structure and the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloy remains thermodynamically stable until approximately all Ni atoms (which occupy all the 2c 104 positions) are substituted by Co atoms.

In the inventive concepts described herein, a thermodynamically stable permanent magnet, for example having the chemical formula YFe3(Ni0.5Co0.5)2, may include no more than three Fe atoms per unit of the compound. Ideally, the Fe atoms would be distributed in the transition metal position 3g 106 nonequivalent atomic sites (as shown in FIG. 1) of the crystal structure 100.

According to inventive concepts described herein, the addition of Ni to Y(Co1-xFex)5 magnets may stabilize the magnet. Transition metals have increasing 3d electron count in the following order: Fe<Co<Ni. Thus, replacing Co atoms with Fe atoms decreases the amount of 3d electrons in the compound, whereas replacing Co atoms with Ni atoms increases the amount of 3d electrons in the compound.

According to inventive concepts described herein, the resulting YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 magnet may have a large energy product. State of the art electronic structure calculations confirmed that addition of Ni to YCo5 magnets stabilized Y(Co1-xFex)5 and maintained a reasonably high MAE comparable with the MAE of YCo5 magnets (see below in Experiments and Modeling Results).

According to inventive concepts described herein, a magnet with YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 material includes Fe atoms, Ni atoms and the Co atoms which may be distributed in transition metal 2c 104 nonequivalent atomic sites. Moreover, high axial MAE may be obtained with energetically stable YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys using abundant and cost-effective Fe and Ni in place of expensive Co, and thereby achieving higher magnetic energy product compared to the YCo5 prototype compound. Some approaches may include a YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compound with partial ordering on the 2c-type 104 sites.

A magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 includes a spin orientation of the Y atom that may be antiparallel to a spin orientation of the Fe, Ni, and Co atoms. The spin properties of the electrons in an atom generate a magnetic moment of the atom, as measured in terms of Bohr magneton (μB). Theoretical measurements of the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 magnet show magnetic moments of Y to be opposite atoms of each of the transition metals (e.g., Co, as shown below in Table 1).

Permanent magnets preferably include material with a high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). The MAE is the very small energy difference between phases with spin moments oriented in the easy and hard directions. The MAE may be defined by appropriate representation of the electronic and magnetic structures. In terms of uniaxial anisotropy, the MAE constant K1>0, where the MAE constant K1 is expressed in MJ/m3 units. The opposite case, K1<0, corresponds to the planar anisotropy. The magnitude of the MAE constant, K1, reflects the magnitude of MAE such that a larger positive value of K1 constant corresponds to a larger uniaxial MAE.

A magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a MAE that is about twice a MAE of Nd2Fe14B. In some approaches, a magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 has a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy constant (K1) that may be greater than about 10.6 MJ/m3.

In some approaches, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 material may have a high MAE that may be comparable to the MAE of praseodymium (PrCo5), samarium (SmCo5), yttrium (YCo5) magnets of 8.1 MJ/m3, 17.2 MJ/m3 and 6.5 MJ/m3, respectively. The theoretical values of the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compounds described herein were derived using novel computational material science approaches (see below in Experiments and Modeling Results).

It is desirable for a magnet material to have a high Curie temperature (Tc) in order to continue to function as a magnet under conditions with elevated temperatures. According to inventive concepts described herein, the material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 has a Curie temperature (Tc) that may be about equal to a Curie Temperature of YCo5. In some approaches, the material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a Tc greater than or equal to about 1000 K.

Moreover, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compound may have a high magnetic energy product, comparable to neodymium-based magnets. The material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than or equal to about 351 kJ/m3. In one exemplary aspect, a YFe3CoNi magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than about 309 kJ/m3. In various aspects, a YFe3CoNi magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than or equal to about 300 kJ/m3.

In at least one exemplary aspect, a thermodynamically stable YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet may be created by substituting up to an additional 30 at. % Ni for Co having a Tc of 900 K which is close to the calculated Tc of YCo5 magnet's Tc of 892 K. The YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than about 351 kJ/m3.

In another exemplary aspect, a YFe3Co2 magnet may be created having a Curie temperature Tc of 1098 K and a maximum energy product of 365 kJ/m3, according to various aspects described herein. The foregoing maximum energy product is about 71% of the maximum energy product for Nd2Fe14B magnets (e.g., 512 kJ/m3).

There are potentially many ways to produce the magnets described here, as would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art after reading the present disclosure. Any such method may be used to present the novel materials described herein.

An illustrative method to form a permanent magnet, which is presented by way of example only, may include starting with a YNi5 compound that is in a CaCu5-type structure. A maximum amount of Fe metal (e.g., ˜60 at %) may be dissolved with the YNi5 compound to form a stable YFe3Ni2 compound in the same structure modification where iron atoms predominantly occupy 3g sites of the crystal structure. In an ideal crystal structure, Fe atoms occupy all 3g positions.

The formation method may subsequently include gradual alloying of the YFe3Ni2 compound with Co, while keeping the amount of Y and Fe constant. In a preferred embodiment, up to 92% of the Ni atoms may be replaced with Co atoms.

Experiments and Modeling Results

YCo5 compounds crystallize in the hexagonal CaCu5-type structure with three non-equivalent atomic sites: Y1-(1a) 102, Co1-(2c) 104, and Co2(3g) 106 (see FIG. 1) with six atoms per formula unit and per computational cell.

Earlier neutron-diffraction studies of the Th(Co1-xFex)5 alloys (also based on the CaCu5-type structure) show that the larger Fe atoms preoccupies the 3g-type 106 sites, whereas the smaller Co atoms choose to occupy the 2c-type 104 sites. This occupational inclination has been affirmed by DFT calculations for YCo5 and SmCo5 compounds. In line with these calculations, the total energy for Fe at the 3g 106 site (E3g) is lower that than for Fe at the 2c 104 site (E2c) by 0.21 eV/f.u. and 0.10 eV/f.u. for YCo5 and SmCo5 magnets, correspondingly. If the YCo5 magnet is doped with Fe and Ni, Fe atoms occupy preferentially 3g 106 sites, while Ni atoms favor 2c 104 sites.

FIG. 2A depicts the heat of formation calculated within the EMTO-CPA technique of the pseudo-binary YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys where Fe atoms occupy all 3g-type 106 sites, and the occupation of the 2c-type 104 sites continuously changes from pure Ni (the YFe3Ni2 compound) to pure Co (the YFe3Co2 compound). The current calculations show that the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys remain stable until almost all Ni atoms are replaced by Co atoms.

FIG. 2B depicts the heat of formation calculated within the EMTO-CPA formalism of the pseudo-binary SmFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys where Fe atoms occupy all 3g-type 106 sites, and the occupation of the 2c-type 104 sites continuously changes from pure Ni (the SmFe3Ni2 compound) to pure Co (the SmFe3Co2 compound). These calculations show that the pseudo-binary SmFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys could remain stable until almost half of Ni atoms are replaced by Co atoms.

Nickel metal forms the stable CaCu5-type compounds with both yttrium and samarium metals. Calculated within EMTO formalism, the heat of formation of SmNi5 and YNi5 compounds (in the CaCu5-type structure) is −18.95 mRy/atom and −22.91 mRy/atom, correspondingly, which is in accord with the experimental measurements of −23.08 mRy/atom (−30.3 kJ/mole, SmNi5) and −25.98 mRy/atom (−34.1 kJ/mole, YNi5). The YFe5 compound as well as the SmFe5 compound do not exist in the equilibrium Y—Fe and Sm—Fe phase diagrams, correspondingly, thus no experimental information about the heat of formation of these hypothetical compounds is available. However, the EMTO calculations show that the heat of formation of the YFe5 compound is positive, +6.46 mRy/atom, and is half of the calculated heat of formation of the SmFe5 compound, +12.68 mRy/atom. As a result, the calculated heat of formation of the YFe3Co2 compound, +0.09 mRy/atom, appears to be smaller than the calculated heat of formation of the SmFe3Co2 compound, +2.15 mRy/atom. The computed heats of formation of the YFe3Ni2 and the SmFe3Ni2 compounds are both negative (stable compounds), however, the absolute value of the calculated heat of formation of the YFe3Ni2 compound, |−6.20| mRy/atom, is more than twice as high as the absolute value of the heat of formation of the SmFe3Ni2 compound, |−2.72| mRy/atom. As a result, the region of stability of the pseudo-binary YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys appears to be almost twice as wide as the region of stability of the pseudo-binary SmFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys.

FIG. 3 depicts a Y—Co phase diagram exhibiting agreement with experiments: (i) congruent melting of Y2Co17 and YCo5 at 1630 K (exp.: 1630 K) and 1615 K (exp.: 1623 K), correspondingly; (ii) decomposition temperature of YCo5 at 914 K (exp.: ˜998 K); (iii) heat of formation of YCo5 equal to ‘−12.46 kJ/mole and ‘−13.61 kJ/mole at 298 and 1000 K, correspondingly, compared with ‘−12.20±0.87 kJ/mole measured between 850 and 1200 K; (iv) heat of formation of Y2Co17 equal to ‘−8.74 kJ/mole and ‘−9.47 kJ/mole at 298 and 1000 K, correspondingly, compared with ‘−7.6±0.80 kJ/mole measured between 850 and 1200 K.

Y and Co spins align in an antiparallel fashion (AF) that is predicted in the present self-consistent calculations. The calculated total moment, m(tot)=7.82μB/f.u., is slightly smaller than the experimentally reported value of 8.30μB/f.u. The calculated spin moments are 1.55μB and 1.47μB for 2c 104 and 3g 106 sites, correspondingly, which are larger than the recorded experimental values of 1.44μB and 1.31μB. The calculated orbital moments are 0.14μB and 0.11μB for 2c 104 and 3g 106 sites, correspondingly, which are smaller than recorded experimental data of 0.26μB and 0.24μB. The present FREMTO calculations reflect the experimental (spin flip-neuron scattering) observation; for the YCo5 compound, the orbital moment of Co1(2c) 104 atoms is bigger than the orbital moment of Co2(3g) 106 atoms. The large MAE of the YCo5 compound comes from a big orbital allowance from Co1(2c) 104 sites, which are located in the same plane as Y1(1a) 102 sites. Appropriately, Co1(2c) 104 atoms have a big positive MAE allowance, while Co2(3g) 106 atoms have a small negative MAE allowance. The axial (positive) MAE of the YCo5 magnet can be achieved only if orbital moments on the Co1(2c) 104 atoms are bigger than the orbital moments of the Co2(3g) 106 atoms.

A mean-field treatment for the Curie temperature, Tc, can be formulated as:

\(T_{c} = {\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{E_{tot}^{DLM} - E_{tot}^{AF}}{k_{B}}}\)

where

\(\left( \frac{E_{tot}^{DLM} - E_{tot}^{AF}}{k_{B}} \right)\)

is the difference among the ground state total energies of the DLM and the AF state, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Principally, an assessment of the Curie temperature can be achieved from the total energy difference between the ferromagnetic (or antiferromagnetic) and the paramagnetic states. The difference between the total energies can be substituted by the difference between the effective single-particle (one atomic specie) energies, which are directly associated with AF and DLM states (the so-called mean-field treatment). In the present work, EtotDLM and EtotAF are calculated at the equilibrium volumes for DLM and AF states, correspondingly. According to the present EMTO-DLM and EMTO-AF calculations, Tc=891.8 K for the YCo5 magnet, which is in good accord with the experimental data Tc=920 K, which is relatively larger than that of the commonly used Nd2Fe14B magnet (Tc=588 K). Similar EMTO calculations reveal Tc=1149.3 K for the YFe5 compound, although this compound does not exist in the Y—Fe phase diagram. There is an experimentally observed tendency of the Curie temperature to increase with Fe doping of the YCo5 magnet, i.e., from Tc=930 K (the YCo5 compound) to Tc=1020 K (the Y(Co0.8Fe0.2)5 compound).

FIG. 4 depicts the Curie temperature calculated within the EMTO-CPA technique of the pseudo-binary YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys where Fe atoms occupy all 3g-type 106 sites, and the occupation of the 2c-type 104 sites continuously changes from pure Ni (the YFe3Ni2 compound) to pure Co (the YFe3Co2 compound). The dotted line corresponds to the calculated Curie temperature of the YCo5 magnet, Tc=891.8 K. The calculated Curie temperature is equal to 572.6 K and 1097.7 K for the YFe3Ni2 and YFe3Co2 magnets, correspondingly. Although the calculated Curie temperature of the YFe3Ni2 compound lies about 320 K below of the Curie temperature of the YCo5 magnet, this deficiency can be removed by substituting 70 at. % of Ni by Co. The Curie temperature of the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet is equal to 899.9 K.

According to the present calculations, the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet shows an enormous total moment of m(tot)˜9.79μB, essentially due to the iron atoms that each contribute with 2.45μB. The total moment of the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet is thus essentially bigger than that of the traditional YCo5 magnet that has a calculated total moment of m(tot)˜7.82μB. The experimental values of saturation magnetization (Ms) and the maximum energy product ((BH)max) for the YCo5 magnet are 0.85 MA/m and 224 kJ/m3, correspondingly. Because saturation magnetization and magnetic moment are approximately proportional, Ms˜ m(tot), and the maximum energy product is approximately proportional to the square of the saturation magnetization, (BH)max˜(Ms)2, one can evaluate that saturation magnetization for the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet is proportional to 1.064 MA/m and the maximum energy product for the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet should be approximately 351 kJ/m3, which is ˜69% of the record maximum energy product of the Nd2Fe14B magnet, (BH)max=512 kJ/m3. Particularly, the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet, which has a Curie temperature similar to the YCo5 magnet, is a substantially steadier magnet than the YCo5 magnet (its maximum energy product should be ˜57% larger).

The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is one of the more important properties of an efficient magnet. In the quest to increase the saturation magnetic moment or energy product, by substituting cobalt for iron, the impact of the doping on the MAE is reviewed.

For the YFe3Co2 and the YFe3CoNi magnets, the iron atoms are kept on the energetically favorably 3g 106 sites. In the case of YFe3CoNi, Co and Ni are modeled as on the 2c 104 sites as two average atoms consistent with modeling of SmFe3CoNi. In all calculations, the atomic volume is relaxed and the c/a axial ratio of the hexagonal phase. Some sensitivity is found (not shown) of the MAE to the axial ratios, suggesting that the structural relaxation is important.

According to the values calculated in Table 2, both YFe5 and YNi5 have relatively small magnetic anisotropy and, for that reason alone, they are not particularly strong magnets. YFe5 is included in the table to provide context to the other magnets, as it does not exist in the hexagonal phase. YCo5 contrarily exists and is predicted to have significant magnetic anisotropy. DFT-GGA calculations are relied on for these magnetic compounds because GGA performs better for the magnetic 3d transition metals relative to the LDA or even more modern approximations. GGA reproduces the proper magnetic ground state of iron, as opposed to the LDA. The GGA calculations reproduce the experimental atomic volume very well but overestimate the MAE for YCo5 relative to experimental data. DFT-GGA (T=0 K) gives the unit cell volume Vcell=82.65 Å3 and anisotropy K1=9.89 meV/cell (19.2 MJ/m3). These numbers are compared to experimental data at T=4.1 K, Vcell=82.50 Å3, K1=3.80 meV/cell (7.38 MJ/m3) and at T=293 K, Vcell=83.99 Å3, K1=3.04 meV/cell (5.80 MJ/m3). Here, the unit cell volume at T=4.1 K, Vcell=82.50 Å3 is identified using the experimental value of the MAE coefficient, K1, presented in the units of (MJ/m3), and (meV/cell).

Replacing most of Co with Fe in the YCo5 magnet and using Ni as a thermodynamic mediator results in an YFe3CoNi magnet with desired magnetic properties such as a very high Curie temperature, robust magnetic anisotropy, and a relatively large maximum energy product. YFe3CoNi magnets use nickel metal as the stabilizing material in the YCo5 magnet in order to accommodate the maximum amount of iron metal to favor a very high magnetization.

For YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys, it is possible to have stable solutions until approximately all Ni atoms are substituted by Co atoms. The ab initio heat of formation predictions are confirmed by CALPHAD modeling at 298 K. The combination of negative heat of formation and extended solubility limits experimentally observed in the YTM5 (TM=Co, Fe, Ni) magnets (e.g., complete solubility from YCo5 to YNi5 at 1073 K and 1273 K; solubility of ˜20 at. % Fe in Y(Co,Fe)5 at 1323 K; solubility of ˜30 at. % Fe in Y(Fe,Ni)5 at 873 K) is promising for synthesis of the foregoing magnets. A specific example includes a YFe3Co2 magnet for which the calculated the Curie temperature, Tc, which is equal to 1097.7 K and the maximum energy product, (BH)max(YFe3Co2), as ˜365 kJ/m3, which is ˜71% of the record maximum energy product of the Nd2Fe14B magnet, (BH)max=512 kJ/m3. Here, the maximum energy products of YFe3Co2 and YFe3CoNi magnets are estimated using the calculated total magnetic moments of YFe3Co2, YFe3CoNi, and YCo5 magnets as well as the experimental values of the saturated magnetization and the maximum energy product of the YCo5 magnet. Calculations are performed in the same fashion as for the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet.

According to the presently disclosed calculations, the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet has a Curie temperature Tc˜900 K that is relatively close to the calculated Curie temperature of the YCo5 magnet, Tc˜ 892 K. In addition, the maximum energy product of the YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet is significantly improved compared to the YCo5 magnet (˜57% larger). The calculated intrinsic properties of the magnets are reported in Table 3 in conjunction with the experimental data of Nd2Fe14B, SmCo5, and YCo5 magnets for comparison. All four suggested permanent magnets have a Curie temperature significantly higher than that of Nd2Fe14B, Tc˜ 588 K, spanning from 785 K to 1103 K. In addition, their maximum energy products are significantly higher than that of the commercially used SmCo5 and YCo5 magnets (231 kJ/m3 and 224 kJ/m3, respectively), reaching a maximum value of 365 kJ/m3 for YFe3Co2. Our calculated (Table 3, LDA) MAEs for YFe3CoNi magnet is not much smaller than that of YCo5 magnet (10.6 MJ/m3 and 13.5 MJ/m3, respectively).

In Use

Considering SmFe3CoNi and YFe3CoNi magnets comprise up to 80% less Co than their SmCo5 and YCo5 precursors, maturing of these magnets becomes even more captivating from the current economic viewpoint. Replacing part of cobalt with iron in SmCo5 and YCo5 magnets stabilized with a small portion of nickel results in permanent magnets having many desirable characteristics. These permanent magnets are anticipated to have outstanding magnetic properties, a large maximum energy product, a strong magnetic anisotropy, and an exceptionally high Curie temperature.

In use, the alloy formulations described herein may be useful as permanent magnets with high MAE and energy product, and useful for high-temperature applications (e.g., Curie temperatures in a range of about 900 K to about 1100 K). The YCoNiFe3 and SmCoNiFe3 alloy formulations described herein may be used for cost-effective clean energy products, turbines, electric car battery applications, etc.
