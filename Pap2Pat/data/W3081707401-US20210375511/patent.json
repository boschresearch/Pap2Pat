                        "Among the great challenges of materials science is discovering a material that satisfies conflicting requirements and also possesses specific properties for a particular application. There is a need for strong permanent magnets to withstand higher temperatures, for example Curie temperatures ranging from 800 K to 1200 K, which the widely used neodymium-based magnets (Nd2Fe14B, Neomax\u00ae) cannot tolerate. Pure Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo) magnets (both SmCo5 and Sm2Co17) satisfy this requirement and are less subject to corrosion than the neodymium-based magnets and thus do not require a coating. Moreover, pure SmCo magnets have strong resistance to demagnetization.",
                        "Three basic material parameters determine the intrinsic properties of hard magnetic materials: (i) spontaneous (saturation) magnetization, (Ms), (ii) Curie temperature (Tc), and (iii) magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). An optimal technological permanent magnet has a large spontaneous magnetization (Ms\u2265\u02dc1 MA), high Curie temperature (Tc\u2265\u02dc550 K), and large MAE constant (K1\u2265\u02dc4 MJ/m3).",
                        "Pure YCo5 permanent magnets exhibit high uniaxial MAE constant of K1\u02dc6.5 MJ/m3, which is excessive compared to that of Nd2Fe14B magnets having MAE with a K1 of \u02dc4.9 MJ/m3. YCo5 permanent magnets have high Curie temperature, Tc\u02dc987 K, which is almost twice that of Nd2Fe14B magnets having Curie temperature, Tc\u02dc588 K. However, the Nd2Fe14B magnet currently dominates the world market for permanent magnets (\u02dc62% of world market), since the Nd2Fe14B magnet has large spontaneous magnetization and possesses the highest energy performance measured by a record high energy product. The Maximum Energy Product (BH)max of the Nd2Fe14B magnet at 512 kJ/m3 is more than twice as high as the (BH)max of YCo5 magnets, at 224 kJ/m3.",
                        "It would be desirable to formulate a permanent magnet with a greater spontaneous magnetization, high MAE and thermostability comparable to YCo5 magnets while having a high Curie temperature."

Ideally, transition-metal dopants may boost the energy product of YCo5 magnets without compromising the high MAE and high Curie temperatures of these magnets. For example, combining transition-metal (TM) with rare-earth-metal (RE) atoms in various intermetallic compounds may result in material in which RE and TM atoms induce a large magnetic anisotropy and provide a large magnetization and high Curie temperature.",
                        "Iron (Fe) is more readily available than cobalt (Co) such that Fe is \u02dc2000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust than Co. Thus, at least from a cost standpoint, it would be beneficial to substitute Co atoms in YCo5 with Fe atoms since the relative abundance of available Fe could result in a less expensive component. In addition, Fe may be desirable as an added component to a magnet material since its ferromagnetic metal properties have a large magnetization at room temperature (1.76 MA/m).",

As an option, the present structure 100 may be implemented in conjunction with features from any other inventive concepts listed herein, such as those described with reference to the other FIGS. Of course, however, such structure 100 and others presented herein may be used in various applications and/or in permutations which may or may not be specifically described in the illustrative concepts listed herein. Further, the structure 100 presented herein may be used in any desired environment.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1, the crystal structure of a CaCu5(D2d)-type Structure 100 with three distinct atoms displayed, may represent a YCo5 compound crystal structure in accordance with some approaches. An yttrium atom (Y1) may be in the Wyckoff position 1a 102 centered in a plane with two Co1 atoms in the position 2c 104 surrounding the Y1 in the position 1a 102 and a second layer with three more Co2 atoms in the position 3g 106 for a total of six atoms in the unit cell. Bonding and energy between the atoms of a crystal structure may be defined by the interactions between 3d-orbital electrons of the transition metals in the position 2c 104 or position 3g 106 and the 5d-orbital electrons from yttrium (Y1) in the center position 1a 102 as shown in FIG. 1.",
                        "In the YFe5 compound that only includes Fe atoms without any Co atoms, the instability of the crystal structure may be related to a decrease in the number of 3d electrons in the electronic structure. Indeed, crystal stabilities of the magnetic 3d transition metals may be governed by the number of 3d electrons.",
                        "Thus, substituting all cobalt atoms with a transition metal with higher magnetic moment, such as iron, in order to optimize the maximum energy product (i.e., YCo5\u2192YFe5) may result in a thermodynamically unstable crystal structure of an ordinary hexagonal phase. Moreover, YFe5 does not appear in the equilibrium Y\u2014Fe phase diagram, although the alloy compound Y(Co1-xFex)5 with CaCu5-type structure has been synthesized for x=0.2 to 0.4.",
                        "For synthesized Y(Co1-xFex)5 materials, the Curie temperatures (Tc) for Y(Co1-xFex)5 alloys were found to increase from about 930 K to about 1020 K when increasing x from 0.0 to 0.2. In contrast, Y2(Co1-xFex)17 alloys exhibit a monotonic decrease in Curie temperature (Tc) with increasing Fe content. The orbital moment of cobalt is larger compared to iron, and a decrease of the MAE occurs for x>0. The lattice constant and magnetization are enhanced for x=0 to 0.4 in Y(Co1-xFex)5 alloys.",
                        "Accordingly, the inventive concepts presented herein, in several embodiments, involve ab initio calculations to add nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) to a YCo5 magnet in order to stabilize Y(Co\u2014Fe\u2014Ni)5 alloys containing a sufficient amount of Fe to boost the energy product of the Y(Co\u2014Fe\u2014Ni)5 magnet.",

In some approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x may be greater than 1\u2212x such that the compound has a greater amount of Co compared to Ni. Accordingly, x may be a value between 0.5 and 1, such as 0.51, 0.52 . . . 0.98, 0.99. In other approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x may be less than 1\u2212x, such that the compound has a greater amount of Ni compared to Co. Accordingly, x may be a value between 0 and 0.5, such as 0.01, 0.02 . . . 0.48, 0.49. Preferably, whether x is greater than or less than 1\u2212x, the values are within a 10% difference of one another, e.g., x is a value in a range of 0.45-0.55. In preferred approaches, the material may have a chemical formula: YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2, where x is about equal to 1\u2212x.",
                        "In at least one contemplated approach, in addition to iron and nickel, copper may be used to dope the YCo5 magnets as described herein. In contrast to the Y(Co1-xFex)5 system, Y(Co1-xNix)5 and Y(Co1-xCux)5 compounds are stable across the composition domain comprising x=0 to 1. Substituting cobalt atoms with nickel and/or copper atoms gradually decreases magnetization and magnetic anisotropy.",

Referring again to FIG. 1, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may form a hexagonal CaCu5-type structure 100: Y1 in position 1a 102, Co atoms, Fe atoms, and Ni atoms sharing transition metal position 2c 104 sites and position 3g 106 non-equivalent atomic sites with 6 atoms per formula unit. In at least one exemplary aspect, Fe atoms occupy all 3g 106 positions of the CaCu5-type structure and the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloy remains thermodynamically stable until approximately all Ni atoms (which occupy all the 2c 104 positions) are substituted by Co atoms.",
                        "In the inventive concepts described herein, a thermodynamically stable permanent magnet, for example having the chemical formula YFe3(Ni0.5Co0.5)2, may include no more than three Fe atoms per unit of the compound. Ideally, the Fe atoms would be distributed in the transition metal position 3g 106 nonequivalent atomic sites (as shown in FIG. 1) of the crystal structure 100.",
                        "According to inventive concepts described herein, the addition of Ni to Y(Co1-xFex)5 magnets may stabilize the magnet. Transition metals have increasing 3d electron count in the following order: Fe<Co<Ni. Thus, replacing Co atoms with Fe atoms decreases the amount of 3d electrons in the compound, whereas replacing Co atoms with Ni atoms increases the amount of 3d electrons in the compound.",
                        "According to inventive concepts described herein, the resulting YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 magnet may have a large energy product. State of the art electronic structure calculations confirmed that addition of Ni to YCo5 magnets stabilized Y(Co1-xFex)5 and maintained a reasonably high MAE comparable with the MAE of YCo5 magnets (see below in Experiments and Modeling Results).",

Moreover, high axial MAE may be obtained with energetically stable YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 alloys using abundant and cost-effective Fe and Ni in place of expensive Co, and thereby achieving higher magnetic energy product compared to the YCo5 prototype compound. Some approaches may include a YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compound with partial ordering on the 2c-type 104 sites.",
                        "A magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 includes a spin orientation of the Y atom that may be antiparallel to a spin orientation of the Fe, Ni, and Co atoms. The spin properties of the electrons in an atom generate a magnetic moment of the atom, as measured in terms of Bohr magneton (\u03bcB). Theoretical measurements of the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 magnet show magnetic moments of Y to be opposite atoms of each of the transition metals (e.g., Co, as shown below in Table 1).",
                        "Permanent magnets preferably include material with a high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). The MAE is the very small energy difference between phases with spin moments oriented in the easy and hard directions. The MAE may be defined by appropriate representation of the electronic and magnetic structures. In terms of uniaxial anisotropy, the MAE constant K1>0, where the MAE constant K1 is expressed in MJ/m3 units. The opposite case, K1<0, corresponds to the planar anisotropy. The magnitude of the MAE constant, K1, reflects the magnitude of MAE such that a larger positive value of K1 constant corresponds to a larger uniaxial MAE.",
                        "A magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a MAE that is about twice a MAE of Nd2Fe14B. In some approaches, a magnet of YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 has a magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy constant (K1) that may be greater than about 10.6 MJ/m3.",
                        "In some approaches, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 material may have a high MAE that may be comparable to the MAE of praseodymium (PrCo5), samarium (SmCo5), yttrium (YCo5) magnets of 8.1 MJ/m3, 17.2 MJ/m3 and 6.5 MJ/m3, respectively. The theoretical values of the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compounds described herein were derived using novel computational material science approaches (see below in Experiments and Modeling Results).",
                        "It is desirable for a magnet material to have a high Curie temperature (Tc) in order to continue to function as a magnet under conditions with elevated temperatures. According to inventive concepts described herein, the material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 has a Curie temperature (Tc) that may be about equal to a Curie Temperature of YCo5. In some approaches, the material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a Tc greater than or equal to about 1000 K.",
                        "Moreover, the YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 compound may have a high magnetic energy product, comparable to neodymium-based magnets. The material of the magnet YFe3(Ni1-xCox)2 may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than or equal to about 351 kJ/m3. In one exemplary aspect, a YFe3CoNi magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than about 309 kJ/m3. In various aspects, a YFe3CoNi magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than or equal to about 300 kJ/m3.",
                        "In at least one exemplary aspect, a thermodynamically stable YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet may be created by substituting up to an additional 30 at. % Ni for Co having a Tc of 900 K which is close to the calculated Tc of YCo5 magnet's Tc of 892 K. The YFe3(Ni0.3Co0.7)2 magnet may have a maximum energy product of the material greater than about 351 kJ/m3.",
                        "In another exemplary aspect, a YFe3Co2 magnet may be created having a Curie temperature Tc of 1098 K and a maximum energy product of 365 kJ/m3, according to various aspects described herein. The foregoing maximum energy product is about 71% of the maximum energy product for Nd2Fe14B magnets (e.g., 512 kJ/m3).",
                        "There are potentially many ways to produce the magnets described here, as would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art after reading the present disclosure. Any such method may be used to present the novel materials described herein.",
                        "An illustrative method to form a permanent magnet, which is presented by way of example only, may include starting with a YNi5 compound that is in a CaCu5-type structure.

This occupational inclination has been affirmed by DFT calculations for YCo5 and SmCo5 compounds. In line with these calculations, the total energy for Fe at the 3g 106 site (E3g) is lower that than for Fe at the 2c 104 site (E2c) by 0.21 eV/f.u. and 0.10 eV/f.u. for YCo5 and SmCo5 magnets, correspondingly.

However, the EMTO calculations show that the heat of formation of the YFe5 compound is positive, +6.46 mRy/atom, and is half of the calculated heat of formation of the SmFe5 compound, +12.68 mRy/atom. As a result, the calculated heat of formation of the YFe3Co2 compound, +0.09 mRy/atom, appears to be smaller than the calculated heat of formation of the SmFe3Co2 compound, +2.15 mRy/atom.
