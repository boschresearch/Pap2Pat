    "abstract": "Generating primordial germ cells (PGCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) advances studies of human reproduction and development of infertility treatments, but currently entails complex 3D aggregates. Here we develop a simplified, monolayer method to differentiate hPSCs into PGCs within 3.5 days. We used our simplified differentiation platform and single-cell RNA-sequencing to uncover new insights into PGC specification. Transient WNT activation for 12 hours followed by WNT inhibition specified PGCs; by contrast, sustained WNT instead induced primitive streak. Thus, somatic (primitive streak) and PGCs are related\u2014yet distinct\u2014lineages segregated by temporally-dynamic signaling. Pluripotency factors including NANOG are continuously expressed during the transition from pluripotency to posterior epiblast to PGCs, thus bridging pluripotent and germline states. Finally, hPSC-derived PGCs can be easily purified by virtue of their CXCR4 + PDGFRA \u2212 GARP \u2212 surface-marker profile and single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals that they harbor strong transcriptional similarities with fetal PGCs.",

                "Within the mammalian embryo, Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) are the harbinger to eggs and sperm; consequently, they are key to the act of reproduction and the vertical transmission of genetic and epigenetic information to the next generation. The developmental origins of mouse PGCs have been thoroughly explored (Chiquoine, 1954;Ginsburg et al., 1990;Lawson and Hage, 1994), thus enabling the stepwise differentiation of mouse pluripotent cells into PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in vitro in 3D cultures (Hayashi et al., 2011;Ohinata et al., 2009). Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from both humans and nonhuman primates have likewise been successfully differentiated into PGCLCs in 3D cultures (Chen et  The ability to generate human PGCLCs in vitro has shed light on early human germline speci cation as well as genetic diseases such as infertility (Fang et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2018) and could eventually enable in vitro manufacture of human eggs and sperm for infertility treatments and other reproductive technologies.",
                "Fundamentally speaking, the developmental precursors to human PGCs and the signals that specify their formation in vivo have remained hitherto uncertain because PGCs arise in weeks 2-3 of human embryogenesis (De Felici, 2016; O'Rahilly and M\u00fcller, 1987) and it is ethically and technically di cult to attain and analyze early post-implantation human embryos. Consequently, knowledge is inferred from in vivo analyses of embryos from related species as well as in vitro differentiation of human PSCs (hPSCs) into PGCLCs (reviewed by Kobayashi and Surani, 2018). Immediately prior to gastrulation, the pluripotent epiblast (which corresponds to PSCs) undergoes anterior-posterior patterning, generating anterior and posterior epiblast regions (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Rivera-P\u00e9rez and Magnuson, 2005). Subsequently, in mouse and pig embryos, PGCs originate in the vicinity of the posterior epiblast; the posterior epiblast also gives rise to the primitive streak (the precursor to endoderm and mesoderm, Fig. 1a) (Ginsburg et al., 1990; Kobayashi et al., 2017). This led to the hypothesis that the posterior epiblast and/or primitive streak/mesoderm may be the precursor to human PGCs (Model 1, Fig. 1a) (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015). This hypothesis was initially surprising, as a hallmark of PGC development in vivo is \"repression of somatic genes\" (including primitive streak/mesodermal markers (Surani et al., 2007)).",
                "However, shared transcription factors are required for both primitive streak and PGC speci cation (Aramaki et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2017;Kojima et al., 2017), hinting at their intertwined origins. Alternatively, PGCs and primitive streak may be two completely independent lineages that arise from nearby precursors (Model 2, Fig. 1a). Finally, studies of cynomolgus monkey embryos have instead proposed that PGCs arise from the dorsal amnion (Sasaki et al., 2016).",
                "Guided by these insights, prevailing strategies for hPSC differentiation into PGCLCs are divided into two phases: rst, exposure to primitive streak/mesoderm-inducing signals (TGF\u03b2 and WNT) for 12-48 hours in monolayer cultures, followed by 3D aggregation and treatment with PGC-specifying signals (BMP, SCF, EGF and LIF) for multiple days (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015;Yokobayashi et al., 2017). This highlighted key inductive signals for PGCLC speci cation, although the precise temporal dynamics with which key signals (e.g., WNT) are needed remains unclear. The transcriptional network that incipiently speci es human PGCs from pluripotent cells also requires further de nition. Pluripotent cells and PGCs share the expression of pluripotency transcription factors, and it is currently proposed that the pluripotency network is rst abolished in differentiating cells and then reactivated in PGCs, at least in mice (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013;Surani et al., 2007). An alternate model is that pluripotency genes are continuously expressed from the pluripotent epiblast to the incipient PGCs, without an intermediate step where pluripotency genes are silenced. Preliminary evidence for this latter model was provided in cynomolgus monkey embryos (Sasaki et al., 2016) but it is unclear whether the same holds true for human PGC speci cation. Taken together, multiple outstanding questions continue to surround where, when, and how human PGCs are speci ed.",
                "Here we develop a simpli ed 2D platform to generate human PGCLCs within 3.5 days of hPSC differentiation, and we demonstrate the applications of this simpli ed differentiation approach to provide new insights into PGCLC speci cation. Prevailing approaches to generate human PGCLCs entail 3D aggregates treated with high concentrations of growth factors (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015). While 3D aggregates may be bene cial as they concentrate intercellular interactions important for lineage speci cation, it is challenging to direct hPSC differentiation within 3D aggregates due to multiple di cult-to-control variables (e.g., limited diffusion of extracellular signals) (reviewed by Fowler et al., 2019). First, we adapt human PGCLC differentiation to monolayer culture and demonstrate that temporally dynamic activation, followed by repression, of WNT signaling is critical. This method can be robustly extrapolated to a wide range of hESC and hiPSC lines to achieve PGCLC speci cation in monolayer culture. Second, we also describe cell-surface markers for human PGCLCs (namely, CXCR4 + PDGFRA -GARP -) that enable their ready puri cation via uorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Third, we provide a detailed characterization of cells en route to PGCLCs speci cation by single cell RNA-sequencing and nd that pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG are continuously expressed during this process, thus bridging pluripotency with germline states. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing shows that monolayer culture-induced PGCLCs share strong transcriptional similarities with PGCs obtained from the human fetus."

                        "Temporally dynamic WNT activation, followed by inhibition, increases e ciency of human PGCLC speci cation We hypothesized that temporal control over WNT signaling might be crucial for PGCLC speci cation, as the precise duration of WNT activity is of paramount importance to specify multiple cell-types from hPSCs (Loh et al., 2016). Prevailing methods for hPSC differentiation into PGCLCs generally entail two steps. First, exposure to posteriorizing signals (including TGF\u03b2, WNT and non-speci c ROCK inhibitor Y27632) that induce primitive streak/mesoderm for 12-60 hours (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015;Yokobayashi et al., 2017). Second, cells are then aggregated in 3D and treated with high concentrations of BMP, EGF, SCF, LIF and Y27632 for multiple days to generate PGCLCs (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015). Using these published protocols as a framework (Fig. S1a) (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015) and NANOS3-mCherry hPSCs to quantify the percentage of NANOS3 + PGCLCs (Irie et al., 2015), we sought to examine the temporal dynamics of WNT signaling and to generate human PGCLCs in monolayer cultures.",
                        "We found that temporally dynamic activation, followed by inhibition, of WNT signaling enhanced human PGCLC speci cation. In the rst phase of differentiation, 12 hours exposure to posteriorizing signals (including WNT agonist CHIR99021) was optimal, in order to subsequently generate NANOS3-mCherry + PGCLCs at the second stage of differentiation (Fig. 1b) in monolayer cultures. This rea rmed ndings that 12 hour treatment with posteriorizing signals is ideal for subsequent PGCLC differentiation (Kobayashi et al., 2017). In our hands, prolonged exposure to posteriorizing signals for 24 hours-which we and others have shown generate primitive streak (PS) cells capable of subsequent endoderm and mesoderm differentiation (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Loh et al., 2014;Loh et al., 2016)-abrogated the subsequent generation of PGCLCs in the second phase (Fig. 1b).",
                        "Subsequently, in the second phase of differentiation, we found that explicit inhibition of WNT signaling (using XAV939 (Huang et al., 2009)) led to a ~ 3-fold improvement in PGCLCs speci cation (Fig. 1c, compare \"base condition\" vs. \"XAV939\"). Conversely, continued WNT activation with CHIR99021 in the second phase of differentiation completely repressed PGCLC speci cation (Fig. 1c). The explicit requirement for WNT inhibitor (beyond simply withholding exogenous WNT) implies that differentiating hPSCs endogenously produce WNT signals (Blauwkamp et al., 2012;Loh et al., 2014;Loh et al., 2016) that inhibit PGCLCs formation. This emphasizes the need to control endogenous signals to guide e cient differentiation and is consistent with how PRDM14 inhibits endogenous WNT signaling during PGCLC speci cation (Sybirna et al., 2020). We conclude that temporally dynamic WNT activation followed by inhibition enhances human PGCLCs speci cation, thus adding a new dimension to our knowledge of PGCLCs development; this parallels how WNT is initially required and then dispensable for pig PGCs speci cation in embryonic explant cultures (Kobayashi et al., 2017).",
                        "Given the importance of this initial 12-hour WNT pulse in the rst phase of differentiation, we sought to molecularly detail the differentiated cells at day 0.5 (D0.5), which constitute a key intermediate en route to PGCLC differentiation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq, using the 10X Genomics droplet-based platform (Zheng et al., 2017)) revealed that these hPSC-derived D0.5 cells are fairly homogenous, and continued to highly express pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG, although SOX2 decreased (Fig. 1d, Fig. S1b,c). D0.5 cells also began to concomitantly express posterior epiblast/future primitive streak markers such as MIXL1, BRACHYURY, FGF8 and NODAL (Fig. 1e, Fig. S1b,c). However, D0.5 cells expressed posterior epiblast/primitive streak markers at lower levels compared to D1 primitive streak cells that were generated by 24 hours exposure to posteriorizing signals (Fig. 1e). Consistent with the use of TGF\u03b2 and WNT agonists to induce D0.5 cells, these cells demonstrated an active transcriptional response to both signaling pathways, including TGF\u03b2 target genes (FOLLISTATIN, ID1 and LEFTY2) and WNT target genes (SP5) (Fig. S1b,c).",
                        "We provisionally designate these intermediate cells generated upon 12-hour exposure to posteriorizing signals as \"posterior epiblast\" to distinguish them from primitive streak (PS). As discussed above, D1 PS cells are capable of generating endoderm and mesoderm, but not PGCLCs (Fig. 1b). We propose that D0.5 cells correspond to \"posterior epiblast\" based on how, in mouse embryos, the post-implantation pluripotent epiblast is formed by embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5), but then PS markers (e.g., Brachyury) are transiently expressed in the posterior region of the epiblast (~ E6-E6.25) immediately prior to overt formation of the morphologically-conspicuous PS (~ E6.5) (Rivera-P\u00e9rez and Magnuson, 2005); similar results have been reported in pig embryos (Kobayashi et al., 2017). However, we note that early human post-implantation embryos remain inaccessible for analysis, and thus assignment of terms such as \"posterior epiblast\" or \"primitive streak\" in human is premised on evolutionary homology to other mammals such as pig and mouse (Fowler et al., 2019). In summary, this discloses a unique transcriptional signature for D0.5 posterior epiblast cells, wherein pluripotency factors OCT4 and NANOG are co-expressed together with primitive streak markers."

                "After generating presumptive posterior epiblast cells, next we tested whether continuous BMP, SCF, LIF, and EGF activation (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015) was required for the entire second phase of PGCLC differentiation in monolayers. First, omitting BMP4 from the culture media for 24 hours on day 2 of the second phase of differentiation led to a ~ 2.5-fold increase in PGCLCs speci cation, while the absence of SCF and EGF in the same time window was super uous (Fig. S2a). Second, past 3D differentiation methods used extremely high BMP4 concentrations (200-500 ng/mL) (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017), but in our monolayer conditions, we observed that signi cantly lower (25-fold) BMP4 concentrations were needed (Fig. S2b). This is consistent with the notion that BMP signaling does not effectively diffuse through large hPSC clusters (Warm ash et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019). 3D aggregates may therefore impair BMP signaling, thus emphasizing potential bene ts of a monolayer differentiation system. Third, LIF, which is commonly used to enhance PGCLCs survival (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015), was dispensable in our platform (Fig. S2c). Fourth, we observed a peak of PGCLCs formation by day 3.5 of differentiation (Fig. S2d).",
                "Combining these improvements together, we developed a monolayer, serum-free protocol (Fig. 2a) to consistently and reproducibly generate 20-30% pure NANOS3-mCherry + PGCLCs within 3.5 days of in vitro differentiation (Fig. 2b). NANOS3-mCherry + PGCLCs puri ed by uorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) expressed hallmark PGCs markers, including POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG, TFCP2L1, PRDM1 (BLIMP1), NANOS3 and TFAP2C (AP2\u03b3) (Fig. 2c). PGCLCs generated using our protocol did not express markers of endoderm (FOXA2, HHEX) or extraembryonic fate (CDX2), thus rea rming their lineage speci city (Fig. S2e). At the protein level, PGCLCs co-expressed NANOG, PRDM1/BLIMP1, SOX17 and OCT4/POU5F1 (Fig. 2d).",
                "We independently validated this monolayer differentiation protocol using a separate SOX17-GFP knock-in reporter hPSC line (Wang et al., 2011) to track the expression of human PGCLCs marker SOX17 (Irie et al., 2015). Our monolayer differentiation protocol generated SOX17-GFP + PGCLCs that expressed NANOS3 but not endodermal marker FOXA2 (Fig. S2f,g), excluding that these PGCs were SOX17 + FOXA2 + endoderm (Loh et al., 2014). We ultimately applied our differentiation protocol across 5 additional hESC/hiPSC lines and found that it reproducibly generated PGCLCs (detailed below; Fig. 3).",
                "Surface-marker pro le of hPSC-derived PGCLCs: CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP - Current protocols to generate human PGCLCs in monolayers (this study) or aggregates (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015) generate heterogeneous cell populations containing a subset of PGCLCs; therefore cell-surface markers to selectively identify and purify PGCLCs would be a boon. EpCAM, ITGA6, PDPN, CD38, KIT and alkaline phosphatase activity have been previously reported to enrich for human or non-human primate PGCLCs (Irie et al., 2015;Sakai et al., 2020;Sasaki et al., 2015). However, at the transcriptional level, many of these markers are also expressed on undifferentiated hPSCs (Fig. S3a), consistent with past reports of protein expression on hPSCs (Irie et al., 2015;Sakai et al., 2020;Sasaki et al., 2015). Using our optimized monolayer platform for PGCLCs differentiation, we thus sought to discover alternative cell-surface markers to purify PGCLCs.",
                "We robotically screened the expression of 369 cell-surface markers using high-throughput FACS (Loh et al., 2016) on SOX17-GFP hPSCs differentiated into D3.5 SOX17-GFP + PGCLCs vs. SOX17-GFP -non-PGCLCs; undifferentiated hPSCs were also included as a negative control (Fig. 3a). This con rmed that EpCAM, ITGA6, PDPN and alkaline phosphatase (Irie et al., 2015;Sakai et al., 2020;Sasaki et al., 2015) were not speci c markers since they were both expressed on hPSCs as well as PGCLCs (Fig. 3a).",
                "In our analysis, the most speci c positive marker for SOX17-GFP + PGCLCs was the chemokine receptor CXCR4/CD184 (Fig. 3a), which similarly marked NANOS3-mCherry + PGCLCs (Fig. 3b). Intriguingly, in model organisms Cxcr4 is known to be expressed by PGCs (Weissman and Shizuru, 2008), where it enables their migration towards the gonads in response to Cxcl12 (Molyneaux et al., 2003); this may also be conserved in human (Mitsunaga et al., 2017). However, CXCR4 is also expressed on mesodermal derivatives (McGrath et al., 1999), and therefore negative expression of mesodermal markers is necessary to exclude mesoderm. We found that the mesodermal markers PDGFR\u03b1/CD140A (Kattman et al., 2011) and GARP/LRRC32 (Loh et al., 2016) were expressed on the D3.5 non-PGCLCs (Fig. 3a,b), thus providing a means to eliminate mesoderm.",
                "Taken together, by relying on a combination of positive (CXCR4) and negative (PDGFR\u03b1, GARP) markers, we de ned a CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -surface marker pro le for hPSC-derived PGCLCs. Logical combinations of positive and negative markers have likewise proven decisive in the puri cation of speci c cell-types in blood and other tissues (Weissman and Shizuru, 2008). In differentiated D3.5 cultures, the CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -fraction contained all PGCLCs; other combinations of these surface markers did not enrich for PGCLCs (Fig. 3c)."

                "Across a panel of 5 distinct, wild-type male and female hESC and hiPSC lines, the present monolayer differentiation method generated an average of 36.7\u00b122.6% (with peaks as high as 73.2%) pure CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -PGCLCs (Fig. 4a). Our CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -cell-surface marker signature allowed us to purify differentiated PGCLCs across all hESC and hiPSC lines tested, using our improved differentiation strategy and without recourse to transgenic reporters (Fig. 4b, Fig. S3b). Across all lines, hPSC-derived CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -PGCLCs upregulated of hallmark PGC markers without substantial expression of endodermal or mesodermal markers (Fig. 4b, Fig. S3b). Immunostaining of FACS-sorted hPSC-derived D3.5 CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -cells con rmed that they ubiquitously coexpressed the PGC marker proteins SOX17, PRDM1/BLIMP1 and TFAP2C/TFAP2\u03b3 (Fig. 4c). This exempli es the delity of PGCLC speci cation across distinct genetic backgrounds and also demonstrates the utility of the CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -surface marker pro le.",
                "Tracking the trajectory and uniformity of PGCLC speci cation in vitro using single-cell RNA-sequencing Next we illuminated the stepwise changes in gene expression as hPSCs incipiently differentiated into posterior epiblast (D0.5) and then into a PGCLC-containing population (D3.5) by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of all of these populations (Fig. 5a). Given that we showed above that the D3.5 population is heterogeneous (Figs. 1234), scRNAseq was important to detail the cellular diversity of this population and to obtain a re ned and speci c transcriptional signature only for the PGCLCs. As a negative control, we also performed scRNAseq of D2 de nitive endoderm (Loh et al., 2014)-a lineage derived from the PS (and thus, on a related but distinct lineage path from PGCs)-to clarify the relationship between human PGCs and endoderm, given that human PGCLCs reportedly express \"endodermal\" marker SOX17 (Irie et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2015). Taken together, we analyzed 24,473 cells by scRNAseq, with a median of > 4000 genes detected per cell in each cell population (Fig. S4a). scRNAseq showed that the D3.5 bulk differentiated population was transcriptionally heterogeneous, comprising two distinct subsets (Fig. 5b, Fig. S4b). One subset comprised PGCLCs expressing NANOS3, TFAP2C and KLF4 (Fig. 5b, Fig. S4c). Intriguingly, the non-PGCLCs expressed lateral mesoderm marker HAND1 and the cardiac mesoderm markers TMEM88, MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN 4 (MYL4) and ALPHA CARDIAC ACTIN (ACTC1) (Loh et al., 2016; Novikov and Evans, 2013) (Fig. 4b, Fig. S4c,d). This suggests that the \"mis-differentiated\", non-PGCLCs at D3.5 are mesoderm-like cells, as evinced by HAND1 protein expression in the D3.5 non-PGCs (Fig. 4c). Indeed, the principal signals we used to differentiate posterior epiblast into PGCLCs (BMP activation and WNT inhibition) are the same ones that differentiate primitive streak into cardiac mesoderm (Loh et al., 2016), suggesting that some cells on the wrong differentiation trajectory respond to these same signals to adopt mesoderm-like identity.",
                "To overcome such population heterogeneity, we asked whether our previously-described cell-surface markers (CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -) enabled the puri cation of homogeneous PGCLCs. While past combinations of cell-surface markers could isolate PGCLCs that were enriched for NANOS3, PRDM1 and TFAP2C expression (Irie et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2015), we surmised that single-cell RNA-seq of FACSsorted PGCLCs would rigorously assess whether they were truly homogeneous at the transcriptome-wide level. scRNAseq of FACS-sorted CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -D3.5 PGCLCs (as described in Fig. 3) revealed that they were essentially homogeneous (97.2% pure PGCLCs) (Fig. 5d). This result thus rea rms the power of our cell-surface marker pro le to precisely isolate PGCLCs from a heterogeneous cell population, thus opening the door to downstream functional and molecular analyses of puri ed PGCLCs.",
                "Integrated scRNAseq analysis of all populations revealed the stepwise changes in gene expression as pluripotent cells segue into D0.5 posterior epiblast and, nally, D3.5 PGCLCs (Fig. 5e, Fig. S4d). Posterior epiblast markers BRACHYURY, MIXL1 and NODAL were transiently expressed at D0.5 (consistent with how posterior epiblast/primitive streak transcription factors are required for mammalian PGC speci cation (Aramaki et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017; Kojima et al., 2017)), but were subsequently downregulated in D3.5 PGCLCs (Fig. 5e). This is consistent with the observed \"repression of somatic genes\" in fully-formed PGCLCs (Surani et al., 2007), although we note that these genes are nonetheless brie y expressed in their precursors (the posterior epiblast). Our side-by-side comparison of PGCLCs and endoderm con rmed that they shared common markers SOX17 and PRDM1 (Irie et al., 2015;Sasaki et al., 2015); however, D3.5 PGCLCs expressed multiple unique markers that were not found in endoderm, including NANOG, NANOS3, TFAP2C, KLF4, and TCL1B (Fig. 5e, Fig. S5a), thus disclosing a single-cell transcriptional signature for hPSC-derived PGCLCs.",
                "We then investigated expression of pluripotency markers during germline differentiation; a quintessential feature of early germ cells (unlike most somatic cell-types) is that they express pluripotency transcription factors (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013; Surani et al., 2007). The prevailing model is that upon early differentiation, pluripotent cells initially downregulate pluripotency factors, but subsequently only cells allocated to the germline \"re-express\" pluripotency factors (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013;Surani et al., 2007) (Fig. 5 ). However, this models contrast with some recent observations made in cynomolgus macaque embryos, where NANOG was observed to be continuously expressed in PGCs precursors and PGCs; nonetheless, similar observations have been precluded in human embryos due to the lack of accessibility of proper developmental stages. To assess which of the two models may pertain to human PGCs, we computationally ordered differentiating cells in our scRNAseq dataset along an inferred \"pseudotime\" (Qiu et al., 2017), and observed that POU5F1 and NANOG were continuously expressed during the transition from pluripotency to posterior epiblast to hPGCLCs (Fig. 5 i). This thus implies continuous expression of pluripotency factors in the transition from pluripotency to germline fate. We sought to experimentally validate this prediction by tracking NANOG expression at the single-cell level. To this end, we engineered NANOG-2A-YFP reporter hESCs wherein Cas9/AAV6 genome editing (Martin et al., 2019) was used to insert a 2A-YFP reporter immediately downstream of the NANOG gene without disrupting its coding sequence (Martin et al., 2020).",
                "NANOG was continuously expressed during the hPSC-to-germline transition, without evidence for NANOG downregulation followed by re-expression. Undifferentiated hPSCs, D0.5 posterior epiblast cells and D1.5 cells were largely NANOG + CXCR4 -, and by D2.5-D3.5, a subpopulation continued to express NANOG but gained CXCR4, thus transitioning to NANOG + CXCR4 + PGCLCs (Fig. 5 ii, Fig. S5b). By contrast, by D2.5-D3.5, other cells lost NANOG, thus differentiating into NANOG -CXCR4 -non-PGCLCs (Fig. 5 ii, Fig. S5b). We independently con rmed these results, by using intracellular ow cytometry to directly stain for NANOG protein itself (Fig. S5b,c). Therefore, after the speci cation of NANOG + posterior epiblast, differentiating cells that \"inherit\" pluripotency factor expression from the posterior epiblast may progress forth to the germline through, at least in part, the inhibition of WNT signaling. Continued NANOG expression may thus serve as a bridge to link the pluripotent and PGC states. This mirrors staining analyses of cynomolgus macaque embryos (Sasaki et al., 2016), and remains to be substantiated in other species.",
                "Single cell RNA-seq analysis con rms that in vitro-derived PGCLCs transcriptionally resemble in vivoderived human fetal PGCs Finally, we used single-cell RNA-seq to determine whether hPSC-derived PGCLCs resemble bona de PGCs within the human fetus. Past work a rmed similarities between human PGCLCs and PGCs using bulkpopulation RNA-seq (Irie et al., 2015) but did not acquire single-cell resolution. Another study used single cell-RNA-seq to compare human PGCLCs and cynomolgus macaque PGCs (Chen et al., 2019), but did not compare them against human fetal PGCs.",
                "A published scRNAseq analysis of > 2000 fetal germ cells (FGCs, including a subset of PGCs) from week 5-26 human fetuses (Li et al., 2017) laid a foundation for assessing the identity of in vitro-derived PGCLCs since it offers a comprehensive roadmap for germ cell development in vivo under physiological conditions. In that study, human FGCs were classi ed into four sequential subsets characterized by mitosis, retinoid signalling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis (termed FGC1 to FGC4, respectively) (Li et al., 2017). We compared human FGCs, along with fetal gonad somatic cells (Li et al., 2017), against our hPSC-derived D3.5 PGCLCs (Fig. 6a, Fig. S6a).",
                "Hierarchical clustering revealed that hPSC-derived PGCLCs were the most similar to FGC1, which represents early-stage PGCs (Fig. 6b). hPSC-derived PGCLCs and FGC1 both expressed pluripotency genes including POU5F1 and NANOG, as well as PGC-speci c markers such as NANOS3, SOX17, PRDM1 and TFAP2C (Fig. 6c). By contrast, these pluripotency and PGCs markers were turned off in later-stage FGC2, FGC3 or FGC4 populations, consistent with exit from a PGC state in vivo (Fig. 6c). hPSC-derived PGCLCs appeared to represent an early PGC population, as they did not express markers of differentiating germline cells (e.g., those involved in retinoid signaling, oogenesis or meiosis), which instead were expressed in FGC2, FGC3 or FGC4 (Fig. S6b). While PGCLCs most closely resembled FGC1, it is not possible to access human pre-migratory PGCs at earlier developmental stages (Li et al., 2017), and it is thus possible that PGCLCs may correspond to even earlier-stage PGCs. Taken together, this shows a striking transcriptome-wide similarity between hPSC-derived PGCLCs in vitro and human fetal PGCs in vivo. hPSC-derived PGCLCs apparently represent an early PGC population prior to the initiation of germline differentiation and meiosis."

                        "Expanding upon past work that successfully generated PGCLCs from hPSCs in 3D aggregates (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015), here we report a simpli ed monolayer system to produce human PGCLCs and we exploit this system to provide new insights into PGCLC speci cation using single-cell RNA-sEq. Stem cells negotiate a series of branching lineage decisions during differentiation (reviewed by Fowler et al., 2019;Waddington, 1940). We hypothesized that at a critical lineage bifurcation, differentiating hPSCs may inadvertently stray down a non-PGC lineage. At this bifurcation, what signals promote PGCLC speci cation at the expense of non-PGCs?",
                        "A principal nding of this work is that temporally dynamic activation, followed by inhibition, of WNT signaling enhanced human PGCLC speci cation. In the rst phase of differentiation, hPSCs are brie y exposed to primitive streak-inducing signals (WNT and TGF\u03b2) for 12 hours to generate candidate \"posterior epiblast\" cells (Kobayashi et al., 2017). By single-cell RNA-seq, this intermediate cell state expresses OCT4 and NANOG together with posterior epiblast/future primitive streak markers, and thus appears analogous to mouse and pig posterior epiblast cells (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Rivera-P\u00e9rez and Magnuson, 2005). In the second phase of differentiation, these posterior epiblast cells apparently face a branching lineage choice to differentiate into PGCLCs or primitive streak. At this lineage choice, continued WNT activation speci ed primitive streak (Kobayashi et al., 2017;Loh et al., 2014;Loh et al., 2016), and therefore WNT inhibition was critical to suppress primitive streak formation and to differentiate posterior epiblast into PGCLCs. In this model, the PGC and somatic (primitive streak) lineages are related-yet distinct-cell-types that both arise from posterior epiblast intermediates and are segregated by mutually-exclusive signals (e.g., WNT). This temporally dynamic role for WNT signaling agrees with analyses of pig embryos (Kobayashi et al., 2017), but further in vivo analyses are warranted to con rm various aspects of this model.",
                        "At the transition from pluripotent to germline states, we nd that pluripotency factor NANOG is continuously expressed in the transition from hPSCs to posterior epiblast to PGCLCs in response to WNT modulation. This mirrors preliminary evidence drawn from cynomolgus macaque embryos (Sasaki et al., 2016). It was initially hypothesized that differentiating cells lose pluripotency factor expression, but cells allocated to the germline \"re-express\" such factors, thus \"regaining\" features of pluripotency (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013;Surani et al., 2007). By contrast, we propose that the continued expression of pluripotency factors such as NANOG may serve as a direct molecular bridge between the pluripotent and germline states; cells that lose such expression may instead differentiate into somatic cells. Our ndings are altogether consistent with Nanog's critical role in mouse PGC speci cation in vivo and in vitro (Chambers et al., 2007;Murakami et al., 2016).",
                        "However, in the monolayer system, typically only one-third of cells (on average 36.7%, across all hPSC lines) differentiate into PGCLCs in 3.5 days. To overcome this limitation, we discovered an alternative cellsurface marker signature for PGCLCs (CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -) that enables their puri cation from multiple hPSC lines. Past markers of PGCLCs (e.g., alkaline phosphatase activity, EpCAM, ITGA6 and PDPN) were also expressed on undifferentiated hPSCs (Irie et al., 2015;Sakai et al., 2020;Sasaki et al., 2015); we nd that the CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -signature separates PGCLCs from undifferentiated hPSCs as well as the non-PGCLCs inadvertently generated during differentiation. Our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of FACS-sorted CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP -PGCLCs also rea rmed that they are a nearly homogeneous population, and thus we foresee this surface-marker sorting strategy will have broad applications in isolating PGCLCs for molecular and functional experiments. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis also revealed strong transcriptome-wide similarities between hPSC-derived CXCR4 + PDGFR\u03b1 -GARP - PGCLCs and early human fetal PGCs (Li et al., 2017), adding to past work that demonstrated similarities by bulk-population RNA-seq (Irie et al., 2015). This thus serves to molecularly authenticate the monolayer generated PGCLCs; however, further functional in vivo tests await, given the ethical di culties of transplanting human PGCLCs into animal models.",
                        "Our single-cell RNA-sequencing survey revealed that the remaining \"mis-differentiated\" non-PGCLCs are mesoderm-like cells. In both monolayer conditions (this study) as well as within 3D aggregates (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017;Sasaki et al., 2015), our inability to generate pure PGCLCs in vitro indicates that we have an incomplete understanding of the inductive and repressive extracellular signals leading to human PGCLCs speci cation. Recent reports suggest that repression of Otx2 (in mouse) (Zhang et al., 2018), or overexpression of SOX17 and BLIMP1 (in human) (Irie et al., 2015;Kobayashi et al., 2017), su ces to generate PGCLCs in vitro even in the absence of any exogenous signals. Delineating the upstream extracellular signals that repress OTX2, or that induce SOX17 and BLIMP1, is therefore paramount to further enhance the e ciency of human PGC formation in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that it is possible to generate human PGCLCs in monolayer cultures. This platform will simplify efforts to dissect the molecular mechanisms that regulate human PGCs induction and maturation and may accelerate the identi cation of culture conditions that will be conducive to the formation of fully-functional, meiosis-competent human germ cells."
