                        "At least three separate origins for Primordial Germ Cells (PGC) have been proposed. First, naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been suggested to uniquely possess germline potential, on the basis of studies that have found that naive mouse (Hayashi et al., 2011) and human (Irie et al., 2014) PSCs could produce PGC-like cells in vitro, whereas primed PSCs could not. Second, other studies have found that human primed PSCs can also differentiate into PGC-like cells (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015), arguing against the hypothesis that nave PSCs are uniquely privileged. Third, analyses of monkey embryos have suggested that the amnion is an alternative origin for PGCs (Sasaki et al., 2016).",
                        "Independent of their proposed origins, the precise lineage path that pluripotent cells take en route to become PGCs has also remained controversial. PGCs were historically thought to originate directly from pluripotent epiblast cells without transition through a somatic-like intermediate. Yet, Brachyurya master regulator of the primitive streak (PS, the embryonic precursor to definitive endoderm and mesoderm) is critical for PGC specification in mouse embryos (Aramaki et al., 2013). Together with the origins of mouse PGCs from the proximal posterior epiblast in the vicinity of the posterior PS (Ginsburg et al., 1990; Lawson and Hage, 1994) and reports that mesoderm-like cells can generate PGCs in vitro (Sasaki et al., 2015), this suggested that PGCs might have a PS-like provenance. A recent report suggested that in vivo, epiblast first matures into posterior epiblast (the precursor to the PS) but that posterior epiblast cells then branch off to give rise to either PGCs or the PS (Kobayashi et al., 2017). In this model, PGCs and PS are distinct lineages but they share a common origin in the posterior epiblast (Kobayashi et al., 2017).",
                        "Given the uncertainties surrounding human PGC origins, preceding methods to generate human PGC-like cells from PSCs generated heterogeneous cell populations containing only a subset of PGC-like cells relied on complex 3D cultures with high concentrations of growth factors and the presence of undefined components like Knockout Serum Replacer (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015); and demonstrated broad line-to-line variability (Yokobayashi et al., 2017). Without the use of transgenic reporters it can be difficult to distinguish PGC-like cells from other commingled fates, as SOX17a marker for human PGCs (Irie et al., 2014) is also expressed in definitive endoderm (Kanai-Azuma et al., 2002) and blood progenitors (Clarke et al., 2013).",
                        "The development of a robust and efficient in vitro platform to generate PGCs from human pluripotent stem cells would enable modeling germ cells development and have implications in treatment of infertility. Provided herein, inter alia, are solutions to these and other problems in the art."

A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of residues in a nucleic acid molecule which can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 out of 10 being 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary, respectively). \u201cPerfectly complementary\u201d means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence. \u201cSubstantially complementary\u201d as used herein refers to a degree of complementarity that is at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%. 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% over a region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more nucleotides, or refers to two nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions (i.e., stringent hybridization conditions).",
                                "The phrase \u201cstringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acids, but to no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology--Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal is at least two times background, preferably 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% formamide, 5x SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42\u00b0 C., or, 5x SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65\u00b0 C., with wash in 0.2x SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C.",
                                "Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides which they encode are substantially identical. This occurs, for example, when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases, the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. Exemplary \u201cmoderately stringent hybridization conditions\u201d include a hybridization in a buffer of 40% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 1X SSC at 45\u2103. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. One of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency. Additional guidelines for determining hybridization parameters are provided in numerous references, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, ed. Ausubel, et al., supra.",

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, \u201cconservatively modified variants\u201d refers to those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a number of nucleic acid sequences will encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.",

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",

For example, in a case where a variant has a deletion relative to an aligned reference sequence, there will be no amino acid in the variant that corresponds to a position in the reference sequence at the site of deletion. Where there is an insertion in an aligned reference sequence, that insertion will not correspond to a numbered amino acid position in the reference sequence.

Other vectors (e.g., non episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \u201cexpression vectors.\u201d In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids.

A dose refers to the amount of active ingredient given to an individual at each administration. The dose will vary depending on a number of factors, including the range of normal doses for a given therapy, frequency of administration; size and tolerance of the individual; severity of the condition; risk of side effects; and the route of administration. One of skill will recognize that the dose can be modified depending on the above factors or based on therapeutic progress. The term \u201cdosage form\u201d refers to the particular format of the pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical composition, and depends on the route of administration. For example, a dosage form can be in a liquid form for nebulization, e.g., for inhalants, in a tablet or liquid, e.g., for oral delivery, or a saline solution, e.g., for injection.",
                                "An \u201ceffective amount\u201d is an amount sufficient to accomplish a stated purpose (e.g. achieve the effect for which it is administered, treat a disease, reduce enzyme activity, reduce one or more symptoms of a disease or condition). An example of an \u201ceffective amount\u201d is an amount sufficient to contribute to the treatment, prevention, or reduction of a symptom or symptoms of a disease, which could also be referred to as a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount.\u201d A \u201creduction\u201d of a symptom or symptoms (and grammatical equivalents of this phrase) means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s), or elimination of the symptom(s). A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d of a drug is an amount of a drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g., preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology or condition, or reducing the likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology, or condition, or their symptoms. The full prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a prophylactically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. An \u201cactivity decreasing amount,\u201d as used herein, refers to an amount of antagonist required to decrease the activity of an enzyme or protein relative to the absence of the antagonist. A \u201cfunction disrupting amount,\u201d as used herein, refers to the amount of antagonist required to disrupt the function of an enzyme or protein relative to the absence of the antagonist. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. For example, for the given parameter, an effective amount will show an increase or decrease of at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 90%, or at least 100%. Efficacy can also be expressed as \u201c-fold\u201d increase or decrease. For example, a therapeutically effective amount can have at least a 1.2-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold, or more effect over a control. The exact amounts will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms (vols. 1-3, 1992); Lloyd, The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding (1999); Pickar, Dosage Calculations (1999); and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins).",

                                "Generating primordial germ cells (PGCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) advances studies of human reproduction and development of infertility treatments, but currently entails complex 3D aggregates. Here we develop a simplified, monolayer method to differentiate hPSCs into PGCs within 3.5 days, with higher efficiencies and improved consistency across multiple hPSC lines. Using our simplified platform and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we find that transient WNT activation for 12 hours differentiates hPSCs into posterior epiblast, a unique state wherein pluripotency and primitive-streak genes are coexpressed. Subsequently, sharp WNT inhibition together with BMP activation specifies PGCs; by contrast, continued WNT instead induces primitive streak. Thus, primitive streak and PGCs are related-yet distinct-lineages segregated by temporally-dynamic signaling. Pluripotency factors are continuously expressed during the transition from pluripotency to posterior epiblast to PGCs, thus bridging pluripotent and germline states. Finally, hPSC-derived PGCs can be easily purified by virtue of their CXCR4+PDGFRA-GARP- surface-marker profile.",
                                "**Introduction**",
                                "Within the mammalian embryo, PGCs are the harbinger to eggs and sperm; consequently, they are key to the act of reproduction itself and the vertical transmission of genetic and epigenetic information to the next generation. The origins of mouse PGCs have been thoroughly explored (Chiquoine, 1954; Ginsburg et al., 1990; Lawson and Hage, 1994), which has enabled the successful, stepwise differentiation of mouse pluripotent cells into PGCs in vitro (Hayashi et al., 2011; Ohinata et al., 2009). Yet, embryonic development of humans and mice has diverged across ~170 million years (Kobayashi and Surani, 2018), and fundamental differences in post-implantation development exist between these two species. In mice, soon after implantation the pluripotent epiblast forms a cup-shaped structure (the egg cylinder), and PGCs originate from the posterior region of the epiblast, in the vicinity of the primitive streak (the precursor to endoderm and mesoderm, FIG. 1A). Conversely, in human embryos, the epiblast is a flat bilaminar epithelium (the embryonic disc), and PGCs first arise within weeks 2-3 of human embryogenesis, presumably also in the posterior part of the embryo (De Felici, 2016; O\u2032Rahilly and M\u00fcller, 1987). Ethical and technical hurdles in attaining early post-implantation human embryos limit our ability to decipher the precise origins of human PGCs and the signals that specify their formation, which have remained hitherto uncertain. Studies of pig embryos also suggest that PGCs form in the posterior epiblast, in the vicinity of the primitive streak (Kobayashi et al., 2017) (FIG. 1A). In cynomolgus monkey embryos, PGCs are instead thought to first form in the dorsal amnion (which also derives from the epiblast), and subsequently migrate into the yolk sac (Sasaki et al., 2016).",
                                "The exact relationship between PGCs and the primitive streak remains mysterious (FIG. 1A). Traditionally, PGCs and primitive streak have been regarded as two completely distinct lineages; in fact a hallmark of PGC development is \u201crepression of somatic genes\u201d, including primitive streak/mesodermal markers (Surani et al., 2007). Nonetheless, PGCs and primitive streak are specified by several common factors. First, the WNT and BMP signaling pathways\u2014which are critical for primitive streak formation (Loh et al., 2014; Loh et al., 2016)\u2014are also critical for PGC specification, and this is conserved across mammalian species studied thus far (Hayashi et al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Ohinata et al., 2009; Sasaki et al., 2016). However, the precise temporal requirements for WNT and BMP signals in PGC specification remain to be elucidated. Second, Brachyury and Eomes (transcription factors expressed in, and important for, the primitive streak) are respectively required for mouse (Aramaki et al., 2013) and human (Chen et al., 2017; Kojima et al., 2017) PGC specification. One interpretation of these results is that PGCs may arise from a primitive streak/mesoderm-like intermediate (Sasaki et al., 2015). Alternatively, PGCs and primitive streak may be two completely independent lineages that coincidentally share several common developmental regulators. Taken together, multiple outstanding questions continue to surround where, when and how human PGCs are specified.",
                                "Given the uncertainties surrounding human PGC origins, preceding methods to generate human PGC-like cells from PSCs generated heterogeneous cell populations containing only a subset of PGC-like cells and relied on complex 3D cultures with high concentrations of growth factors (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015). Published protocols to differentiate hPSCs into PGCs show wide line-to-line variability (Yokobayashi et al., 2017), with a systematic comparison of multiple hPSC lines showing that, on average, less than 10% pure PGCs are generated (Chen et al., 2017). These complicates the generation of PGCs from hPSCs and our ability to dissect the precise mechanism of human PGC specification, including developmental intermediates and the precise timings and combinations of key extracellular signals.",
                                "Here we develop a simplified 2D in vitro platform to generate human PGCs within 3.5 days of hPSC differentiation, with the dual goals of better understanding the key lineage intermediates and extracellular signals in PGC specification and to simplify the production of human PGCs for future drug discovery, disease modeling and perhaps infertility treatments. First, we find that primed PSCs are competent to generate PGCs, and they first briefly differentiate into posterior epiblast (in 12 hours) before splitting off from the primitive streak lineage trajectory and then committing to form PGCs. Second, these differentiation steps entail the temporally dynamic activation and repression of the WNT and BMP pathways and this method can be robustly extrapolated to a wide range of hESC and hiPSC lines. Third, we also describe unique cell-surface markers for human PGC-like cells (namely, CXCR4+PDGFRA-GARP-) that enable their ready purification via flow cytometry. Finally, we provide a detailed characterization of cells en route to PGC specification by single cell RNA-seq analysis and find that pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG are continuously expressed during this process, thus bridging pluripotency with germline states.",
                                "**Results**",
                                "Brief exposure of pluripotent cells to primitive streak-inducing signals generates posterior epiblast cells with PGC potential. As a starting point, we first evaluated two published methods to differentiate hPSCs into PGCs (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015) and tested them on two hPSC reporter lines wherein fluorescent reporters were knocked into endogenous PGC marker genes: NANOS3-mCherry (Irie et al., 2014) and SOX17-GFP (Wang et al., 2011) (Fig. 1b). NANOS3 and SOX17 are both markers of human PGCs (Irie et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2015), although SOX17 is less specific, as it is also expressed in endoderm (Loh et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011).",
                                "Both published methods to differentiate hPSCs into PGCs are divided into two phases (FIG. 1B). First, hPSCs are exposed to posteriorizing, primitive streak (PS)-inducing signals for 42 hours (Sasaki et al., 2015) or 12 hours (Kobayashi et al., 2017). Second, cells are then aggregated in 3D and are treated with high concentrations of BMP, EGF, SCF and LIF together with a non-specific ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) for 4 days (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015). In our hands, prolonged differentiation of hPSCs into PS for 42 hours at the first phase of differentiation (Sasaki et al., 2015) failed to reproducibly generate PGCs by the second stage (FIG. 1B). However, brief 12-hour exposure of hPSCs to PS-inducing signals was effective in generating PGCs (Kobayashi et al., 2017), albeit at lower frequencies compared to the original report (FIG. 1B). Based on these initial observations, we expanded upon the latter method, with emphasis on increasing differentiation efficiencies while obviating the need for complex 3D aggregates (Kobayashi et al., 2017). We used NANOS3-mCherry hPSCs to screen different culture conditions.",
                                "First, we determined the optimal exposure of hPSCs to PS-inducing signals at the first stage of differentiation. We found that treating hPSCs with TGF\u03b2 agonist (ACTIVIN), WNT agonist (CHIR99021) and Y27632 for 12 hours (Kobayashi et al., 2017) at the first stage was optimal in order to subsequently generate NANOS3-mCherry+ PGCs at the second stage of differentiation as monolayers (FIG. 1C). We henceforth refer to these intermediate cells generated upon 12-hour exposure to PS-inducing signals as \u201cposterior epiblast\u201d. This is consistent with how, in mouse embryos, the post-implantation pluripotent epiblast is formed by embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5), but then PS markers (e.g., Brachyury) are transiently expressed in the posterior region of the epiblast (~E6-E6.25) immediately prior to overt formation of the morphologically-conspicuous PS (~E6.5) (Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005); similar results have been reported in pig embryos (Kobayashi et al., 2017). By contrast, treating hPSCs with these same signals (ACTIVIN, CHIR99021 and Y27632) for 24 hours\u2014which we have shown generates fully-fledged PS cells (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Loh et al., 2014; Loh et al., 2016)\u2014prevented subsequent differentiation into PGCs (FIG. 1C). In summary, pluripotent cells briefly exposed to PS-inducing signals become posterior epiblast cells, which then bifurcate in fate: cells can divert to become PGCs, but prolonged exposure to PS-inducing signals generates fully-fledged PS cells that become primed for endoderm and mesoderm differentiation (FIG. 1C). Taken together, this may reconcile the controversial relationship of the primitive streak and PGCs.",
                                "Given the unique competence of these incipient posterior epiblast cells (but not primitive streak) to give rise to PGCs, we sought to molecularly describe in more detail this transient intermediate state. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) revealed that day 0.5 (D0.5) hPSC-derived posterior epiblast cells continued to highly express pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG, although SOX2 began to decrease (FIG. 1D, FIGS. 5A, 5B). Posterior epiblast also began to concomitantly express posterior epiblast/future primitive streak markers such as MIXL1,BRACHYURY, FGF8 and NODAL (FIG. 1D, FIGS. 5A, 5B), although generally at lower levels as compared to D1 PS cells (FIG. 1E). Consistent with the use of TGF\u03b2 and WNT agonists to induce hPSC-derived posterior epiblast, such cells demonstrated an active transcriptional response to both signaling pathways, including TGF\u03b2 target genes (FOLLISTATIN, ID1 and LEFTY2) and WNT target genes (SP5) (FIG. 1D, FIGS. 5A, 5B). In summary, this discloses a unique transcriptional signature for posterior epiblast cells, where OCT4 and NANOG are co-expressed together with primitive streak markers.",
                                "Temporally dynamic WNT signaling drives progression of human pluripotent cells into posterior epiblast and then PGC-like cells. After generating D0.5 posterior epiblast cells, next we sought to optimize their subsequent differentiation into PGCs (the second phase of differentiation). Initial WNT activation for 12 hours differentiated hPSCs into posterior epiblast (FIG. 1C), but we hypothesized that later, WNT signaling has a temporally dynamic role in germline specification. We thus tested whether further activation or inhibition of WNT signaling (after the first 12 hours of activation) had an effect. Remarkably, sharp inhibition of WNT signaling (leaving all the other culture conditions unaltered) was sufficient to drastically enhance the yield of PGC formation by ~3-fold (FIG. 1F). Conversely, prolonged activation of WNT blocked PGC formation (FIG. 1F). These findings demonstrate that WNT initially promotes, and then sharply inhibits PGC specification in a temporally-dynamic fashion. Consequently, inhibiting WNT after the first 12 hours diverts posterior epiblast cells away from the PS, instead differentiating them into PGCs. The temporally-dynamic role of WNT explains why protocols that activate WNT for 42 sustained hours during PGC differentiation (Sasaki et al., 2015) generate low numbers of PGCs (FIG. 1B). Our results that late-stage WNT repression promotes PGC specification is consistent with how, after the posterior epiblast has formed, WNT is dispensable for PGC formation in pig embryonic explants (Kobayashi et al., 2017).",
                                "After demonstrating a positive effect of WNT inhibitors, we tested whether continuous BMP, SCF, LIF and EGF activation (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015) was required for the entire second phase of PGC differentiation. First, omitting BMP4 from the culture media for 24 hrs at day 2 of differentiation was sufficient to promote the differentiation of PGCs from about 10% to 30% while the absence of SCF and EGF in the same time window was superfluous (FIG. 5C). Second, past 3D differentiation methods used extremely high BMP4 concentrations (200-500 ng/mL) (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017), but in our monolayer conditions, we observed that significantly (25-fold) lower BMP4 concentrations were needed (FIG. 5D). This is consistent with the notion that BMP signaling does not effectively diffuse through large hPSC clusters (Warmflash et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019). 3D aggregates may therefore impair BMP signaling, thus emphasizing the benefits of a monolayer differentiation system. Third, LIF, which is commonly used to enhance PGC survival (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015), was dispensable in our platform (FIG. 5E). Fourth, we observed a peak of PGC formation by day 3.5 of differentiation (FIG. 1F).",
                                "Combining these improvements together, we developed a monolayer, serum-free protocol (FIG. 1G) to consistently and reproducibly generate 20-30% pure NANOS3-mCherry+ PGCs within 3.5 days of in vitro differentiation (FIG. 1H). NANOS3-mCherry+ PGCs purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) expressed hallmark PGC markers, including POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG, TFCP2L1, PRDMI (BLIMP1), NANOS3 and TFAP2C (AP2y) (FIG. 1i). hPSC-derived PGCs generated using our protocol did not express markers of endoderm (FOXA2, HHEX) or extraembryonic fate (CDX2), thus reaffirming their lineage specificity (FIG. 5G). At the protein level, PGCs showed co-expression of PGCs-specific markers like NANOG and PRDM1/BLIMP1 or SOX17 and PRDM1/BLIMP1 (FIG. 1K). When the same differentiation protocol was applied to the SOX17-GFP knock-in reporter hPSCs (Wang et al., 2011) we confirmed that the SOX17-GFP+ PGCs obtained by D3.5, expressed NANOS3 but not endodermal marker FOXA2(FIG. 5H), confirming that these PGCs were not SOX17+FOXA2+ endoderm (Loh et al., 2014). We ultimately applied our differentiation protocol across 6 different hESC/hiPSC lines and found that it reproducibly generated PGCs (detailed below; FIG. 3). However, we note that the SOX17-GFP reporter hPSCs lack one functional allele of SOX17, which is required for human PGC specification (Irie et al., 2014). Therefore SOX17-GFP+ PGCs generated from SOX17-GFP hPSCs had reduced expression of several PGC markers by comparison to wild-type hPSC-derived PGCs (FIGS. 6A-6C). This reveals potential disadvantages in using genetically-engineered reporter hPSC lines; below, we overcame this limitation by applying our differentiation protocol to wild-type hPSC lines.",
                                "Surface-marker profile of hPSC-derived PGCs: CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP-. To produce and utilize human PGCs generated from wild-type hPSC lines, we require a means (e.g., cell-surface markers) to identify the successfully-generated PGCs without recourse to genetic reporters (Irie et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2015). Using our optimized monolayer platform for PGC differentiation, we thus sought to discover cell-surface markers in order to exclusively purify hPSC-derived PGCs from wild-type hPSC lines. Various markers such as alkaline phosphatase activity (Irie et al., 2014) and EpCAM and ITGA6 expression (Sasaki et al., 2015) have been reported to enrich for PGCs, but are not specific to PGCs, as they also mark undifferentiated hPSCs.",
                                "We robotically screened the expression of 369 cell-surface markers using high-throughput FACS (Loh et al., 2016) on SOX17-GFP hPSCs that had been differentiated towards PGCs for 3.5 days. We assessed surface marker expression on D3.5 SOX17-GFP+ PGCs vs. SOX17-GFP- non-PGCs; undifferentiated hPSCs were also included as a negative control (Table 5). This confirmed that EpCAM and ITGA6 (Sasaki et al., 2015) were not specific markers; they were both expressed on hPSCs as well as PGCs (Table 5).",
                                "In our analysis, the most specific positive marker for SOX17-GFP+ PGCs was the chemokine receptor CXCR4/CD184 (Table 5), which we validated to similarly mark NANOS3-mCherry+ PGCs (FIG. 2A). In model organisms, Cxcr4 is known to be expressed by later-stage PGCs, where it enables their migration towards the gonads in response to Cxcl12 (Molyneaux et al., 2003); this may also be conserved in human (Mitsunaga et al., 2017). However, CXCR4 is also expressed on mesodermal derivatives (McGrath et al., 1999), and therefore negative expression of mesodermal markers is necessary to exclude mesoderm. We found that the mesodermal markers PDGFRA/CD140A (Kattman et al., 2011) and GARP/LRRC32 (Loh et al., 2016) were expressed on the D3.5 non-PGCs (Table 5, FIG. 2A), thus providing a means to eliminate mesoderm.",
                                "Taken together, by relying on a combination of positive (CXCR4) and negative (PDGFRA, GARP) markers, we defined a CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- surface marker profile for hPSC-derived PGCs. In differentiated D3.5 cultures, the CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- fraction contained all PGCs; other combinations of these surface markers did not enrich for PGCs (FIG. 2B). Immunostaining of FACS-sorted hPSC-derived D3.5 CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- cells confirmed that they ubiquitously expressed the PGC marker proteins SOX17, PRDM1/BLIMP1 and TFAP2C/TFAP2y (FIG. 2B).",
                                "PGCs can be consistently generated across diverse hESC and hiPSC lines. Our monolayer differentiation method was more efficient at generating PGCs by comparison to two prevailing 3D-based methods (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015) (FIG. 3A). Across a panel of 5 distinct, wild-type male and female hESC and hiPSC lines, the present differentiation method generated an average of 36.7\u00b122.6% (with peaks as high as 73.2%) pure CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- PGCs, which was several-fold more efficient than previously possible with prior methods (7.3\u00b15.6% (Kobayashi et al., 2017) and 10.0\u00b15.2% (Sasaki et al., 2015)) in side-by-side comparisons (FIG. 3A). Therefore, despite the tremendous enthusiasm in differentiating 3D aggregates or \u201corganoids\u201d (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014), 2D cultures may offer certain advantages with regard to the efficiency and simplicity of differentiation.",
                                "Our CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- cell-surface marker signature allowed us to purify differentiated PGCs across all hESC and hiPSC lines tested, using our improved differentiation strategy and without recourse to transgenic reporters (FIG. 3B, FIGS. 7A-7B). Across all lines, hPSC-derived CXCR4+ PDGFRA- GARP- PGCs demonstrated upregulation of hallmark PGC markers without substantial expression of endodermal or mesodermal markers (FIG. 3B, FIGS. 7A-7B). This exemplifies the fidelity of PGC specification across distinct genetic backgrounds and also demonstrates the utility of the surface-marker profile.",
                                "Tracking the trajectory and uniformity of PGC specification in vitro using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Finally, we illuminated the stepwise changes in gene expression as hPSCs incipiently differentiated into posterior epiblast (D0.5) and then into a PGC-containing population (D3.5) by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of all of these populations (FIG. 4A, FIG. 8A). Given that we showed above that the D3.5 population is heterogeneous (FIGS. 1-3), scRNAseq was important to detail the cellular diversity of this population and to obtain a refined transcriptional signature only of the PGCs. We also performed scRNAseq of D2 definitive endoderm (Loh et al., 2014)\u2014a lineage derived from the PS (and thus, on a related but distinct lineage path from PGCs)-to clarify the relationship between human PGCs and endoderm, given that human PGCs have been previously reported to express \u201cendodermal\u201d markers SOX17 and GATA4 (Irie et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2015). Taken together, we analyzed 24,473 cells by scRNAseq, with a median of >4000 genes detected per cell in each cell population (FIG. 8A).",
                                "scRNAseq showed that the D3.5 bulk differentiated population was transcriptionally heterogeneous, comprising two distinct subsets (FIG. 4B, FIG. 8B). One subset comprised PGCs expressing NANOS3, TFAP2C and KLF4 (FIG. 4B, FIG. 8C). Intriguingly, the non-PGCs expressed lateral mesoderm marker HAND1 and the cardiac mesoderm markers TMEM88, MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN 4 (MYL4) and ALPHA CARDIAC ACTIN (ACTCI) (Loh et al., 2016; Novikov and Evans, 2013) (FIG. 4B, FIGS. 8C, 8D). This suggests that the \u201cmis-differentiated\u201d, non-PGCs at D3.5 are mesoderm-like cells, as evinced by HAND1 protein expression in the D3.5 non-PGCs (FIG. 4C). Indeed, the principal signals we used to differentiate posterior epiblast into PGCs (BMP activation and WNT inhibition) are the same ones that differentiate primitive streak into cardiac mesoderm (Loh et al., 2016). However, FACS sorting of the D3.5 population for CXCR4+ GARP- PDGFRA- cells (as described in FIG. 3) yielded an essentially homogeneous (97.2%) population of PGCs, as shown by scRNAseq of the FACS-sorted cells (FIG. 4D). This thus reaffirms the power of our cell-surface marker profile to precisely isolate PGCs from a heterogeneous cell population.",
                                "Integrated scRNAseq analysis of all populations revealed the stepwise changes in gene expression as pluripotent cells segue into D0.5 posterior epiblast and finally, D3.5 PGCs (FIG. 4E, FIG. 8D). While posterior epiblast markers BRACHYURY, MIXLI and NODAL were transiently expressed at D0.5, they were subsequently downregulated in D3.5 PGCs (FIG. 4E). This is consistent with the observed \u201crepression of somatic genes\u201d in fully-formed PGCs (Surani et al., 2007), although we note that these genes are nonetheless briefly expressed in their precursors (the posterior epiblast). Our side-by-side comparison of hPSC-derived PGCs and endoderm confirmed that they shared common markers SOX17 and PRDM1/BLIMP1 (Irie et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2015); however D3.5 PGCs expressed multiple unique markers that were not found in endoderm, including NANOG, NANOS3, TFAP2C, KLF4 and TCL1B (FIG. 4E, FIG. 9A). This thus discloses a single-cell transcriptional signature for hPSC-derived PGCs.",
                                "Finally, we investigated expression of pluripotency markers during germline differentiation; a quintessential feature of early germ cells (unlike most somatic cell-types) is that they express pluripotency transcription factors (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013; Surani et al., 2007). The prevailing model is that upon early differentiation, pluripotent cells initially downregulate pluripotency factors, but subsequently only cells allocated to the germline then \u201cre-express\u201d pluripotency factors (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013; Surani et al., 2007) (FIG. 4F, panel i). However, after computationally ordering differentiating cells in our scRNAseq dataset along an inferred \u201cpseudotime\u201d, OCT4 and NANOG were continuously expressed during the transition from pluripotency to posterior epiblast to PGCs (FIG. 4F, panel ii). This thus implies continuous expression of pluripotency factors in the transition from pluripotency to germline fate. We sought to experimentally validate this prediction by tracking NANOG expression at the single-cell level. To this end, we engineered NANOG-2A-YFP reporter hESCs wherein Cas9/AAV6 genome editing (Martin et al., 2019) was used to insert a 2A-YFP reporter immediately downstream of the NANOG gene without disrupting its coding sequence.",
                                "We found that NANOG was continuously expressed during the hPSC-to-germline transition, without evidence for NANOG downregulation followed by re-expression. Undifferentiated hPSCs, D0.5 posterior epiblast cells and D1.5 cells were largely NANOG+ CXCR4-, but then by D2.5-D3.5, a subpopulation continued to express NANOG but gained CXCR4, thus transitioning to NANOG+ CXCR4+ PGCs (FIG. 4F, panel iii; FIG. 9B). By contrast, by D2.5-D3.5, other cells lost NANOG, thus differentiating into NANOG- CXCR4- non-PGCs (FIG. 4F, panel iii; FIG. 9B). We independently confirmed these results obtained using the NANOG-2A-YFP reporter hESCs, by instead using intracellular flow cytometry to stain for NANOG protein itself (FIGS. 8B, 8C).",
                                "Therefore, after posterior epiblast formation, differentiating cells that \u201cinherit\u201d pluripotency factor expression from the posterior epiblast may progress forth to the germline, by contrast to the prevailing model that differentiating cells first downregulate and later \u201cre-express\u201d pluripotency genes (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013; Surani et al., 2007). Continued NANOG expression may thus serve as a bridge to link the pluripotent and PGC states.",

                                "The origins of human PGCs\u2014as well as the exact lineage intermediate(s) and inductive extracellular signal(s) leading to their specification\u2014remain incompletely understood. This has complicated efforts to efficiently generate PGCs in vitro from hPSCs. While germline and somatic cells are extremely different cell-types, the development of PGCs and primitive streak (PS) cells unexpectedly relies on certain shared signaling pathways and transcription factors (Aramaki et al., 2013; Hayashi et al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Ohinata et al., 2009), and thus the relationship between these lineages has remained mysterious. We find that primed human PSCs (corresponding to post-implantation epiblast) are capable of generating PGCs (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2015), but they must first be briefly exposed to PS-inducing signals (WNT and TGF\u03b2 to generate posterior epiblast, the common precursor to both PS and PGCs (Kobayashi et al., 2017). While sustained exposure to PS-inducing signals (e.g., WNT activation) further differentiates posterior epiblast into PS (Kobayashi et al., 2017; Loh et al., 2014; Loh et al., 2016), here we show that WNT suppression and BMP activation launches posterior epiblast into the PGC lineage and away from the PS lineage trajectory. In this model, the PGC and PS lineages are related-yet distinct\u2014cell-types that arise from posterior epiblast intermediates and are segregated by mutually-exclusive signals (e.g., WNT).",
                                "Hence, there is both a temporal and combinatorial logic with which cells interpret WNT during germline specification. While WNT must be initially activated to differentiate hPSCs towards posterior epiblast, 12 hours later it inhibits PGC formation. At the 12-hour time point, we find that posterior epiblast cells have a unique molecular signature, denoted by pluripotency and PS marker co-expression. This is consistent with how E6.0-E6.25 mouse posterior epiblast expresses both Nanog and Brachyury immediately prior to overt formation of the primitive streak (Hoffman et al., 2013; Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005). Posterior epiblast cells that receive both BMP and WNT signals respond by differentiating into PS (Loh et al., 2014; Loh et al., 2016), whereas those that receive BMP (in the absence of WNT) instead differentiate into PGCs. The molecular mechanisms underlying temporally dynamic reinterpretation of the WNT signal are enigmatic, but in mouse, a brief pulse of WNT can rapidly induce Brachyury, which subsequently ignites the expression of hallmark PGC markers (Aramaki et al., 2013). During this stepwise process, we find that pluripotency factors (OCT4 and NANOG) are continuously expressed in the transitions from hPSCs to posterior epiblast to PGCs. Thus, the continued expression of these pluripotency factors may serve as a molecular bridge between the pluripotent and germline states; cells that lose such expression may instead differentiate into somatic cells. This contrasts with an earlier hypothesis that differentiating cells lose pluripotency factor expression, but cells allocated to the germline \u201cre-express\u201d such factors (reviewed by Magnusdottir and Surani, 2013; Surani et al., 2007).",
                                "Finally, while we report a more efficient, reproducible and simplified monolayer system to generate human PGCs, despite our improvements, typically only one-third of cells (36.7%, across all hPSC lines) in the D3.5 population are PGCs (FIG. 2). Our single-cell RNA-sequencing survey revealed that the remaining \u201cmis-differentiated\u201d cells are mesoderm-like cells. Recent reports suggest that repression of Otx2 (in mouse), or overexpression of SOX17 and BLIMP1(in human) (Irie et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2017), suffices to generate PGCs in vitro even in the absence of any exogenous signals. Delineating the upstream extracellular signals that repress OTX2, or that induce SOX17 and BLIMPl, is therefore paramount to further enhance the efficiency of human PGC formation in vitro.",
