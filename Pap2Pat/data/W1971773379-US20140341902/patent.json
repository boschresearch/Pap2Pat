                        "The provision of two distinct signals to T-cells is a widely accepted model for lymphocyte activation of resting T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Lafferty et al, Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. ScL 53: 27-42 (1975). This model further provides for the discrimination of self from non-self and immune tolerance. Bretscher et al, Science 169: 1042-1049 (1970); Bretscher, P. A., P.N.A.S. USA 96: 185-190 (1999); Jenkins et al, J. Exp. Med. 165: 302-319 (1987). The primary signal, or antigen specific signal, is transduced through the T-cell receptor (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigen peptide presented in the context of the major histocompatibility-complex (MHC). The second or co-stimulatory signal is delivered to T-cells by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and induce T-cells to promote clonal expansion, cytokine secretion and effector function. Lenschow et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:233 (1996). In the absence of co-stimulation, T-cells can become refractory to antigen stimulation, do not mount an effective immune response, and further may result in exhaustion or tolerance to foreign antigens.",
                        "In the two-signal model T-cells receive both positive and negative secondary co-stimulatory signals. The regulation of such positive and negative signals is critical to maximize the host's protective immune responses, while maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Negative secondary signals seem necessary for induction of T-cell tolerance, while positive signals promote T-cell activation. While the simple two-signal model still provides a valid explanation for naive lymphocytes, a host's immune response is a dynamic process, and co-stimulatory signals can also be provided to antigen-exposed T-cells. The mechanism of co-stimulation is of therapeutic interest because the manipulation of co-stimulatory signals has shown to provide a means to either enhance or terminate cell-based immune response. Recently, it has been discovered that T cell dysfunction or anergy occurs concurrently with an induced and sustained expression of the inhibitory receptor, programmed death 1 polypeptide (PD-1). As a result, therapeutic targeting of PD-1 and other molecules which signal through interactions with PD-1, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are an area of intense interest.",
                        "PD-L1 is overexpressed in many cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis (Okazaki T et al., Intern. Immun. 2007 19(7):813) (Thompson R H et al., Cancer Res 2006, 66(7):3381). Interestingly, the majority of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes predominantly express PD-1, in contrast to T lymphocytes in normal tissues and peripheral blood T lymphocytes indicating that up-regulation of PD-1 on tumor-reactive T cells can contribute to impaired antitumor immune responses (Blood 2009 114(8):1537). This may be due to exploitation of PD-L1 signaling mediated by PD-L1 expressing tumor cells interacting with PD-1 expressing T cells to result in attenuation of T cell activation and evasion of immune surveillance (Sharpe et al., Nat Rev 2002) (Keir M E et al., 2008 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26:677). Therefore, inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction may enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of tumors.",
                        "The inhibition of PD-1 axis signaling through its direct ligands (e.g., PD-L1, PD-L2) has been proposed as a means to enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g., tumor immunity). Moreover, similar enhancements to T cell immunity have been observed by inhibiting the binding of PD-L1 to the binding partner B7-1. Furthermore, combining inhibition of PD-1 signaling with other signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK pathway, \u201cMEK\u201d) that are deregulated in tumor cells may further enhance treatment efficacy. However, an optimal therapeutic treatment would combine blockade of PD-1 receptor/ligand interaction with an agent that directly inhibited tumor growth, optionally further including unique immune enhancing properties not provided by PD-1 blockade alone. There remains a need for such an optimal therapy for treating, stabilizing, preventing, and/or delaying development of various cancers.",

It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells. Exhaustion prevents optimal control of infection and tumors.

An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains and four CH domains for 1.1 and E isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 and pt, respectively. The \u03b3 and a classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2.",

The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.

Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.

The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CH1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab\u2032)2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.

Briefly, human melanoma cell lines (Malme-3M, A2058, A375, HS294T, SK23, SKMEL-28, 537 MeI, RPMI-795) and human colorectal cell lines (Colo 320 DM, Colo 205, WiDr, Colo 741, RKO, DLD-1, HM7, HCT-15) were treated with 1 micromolar MEKi GDC-0973 or G-38963, BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) GDC-0879, or DMSO vehicle for 24 hours. Following treatment, cells were stained for surface MHC Class I expression with an antibody against HLA-A,B,C for subsequent FACS analysis. Data shown is for treatment with MEKi GDC-0973. Labeled isotype-matched antibodies were used to determine the level of non-specific staining. Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that cell surface expression of MHC-I was upregulated in MEKi treated cells as compared to vehicle treated cells (FIG. 1A). In contrast, cell surface expression of MHC-I in BRAFi treated cells was not upregulated as compared to vehicle treated cells (FIG. 2). These results demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I in both melanoma and colorectal tumor cells is specific to MEK inhibition and not due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway.",

                                "Recent studies have shown that MEK inhibitor treatment impairs T lymphocyte function (Boni et al., Cancer Res., 70(13), 2010). To confirm that MEK inhibitor treatment impaired CD8+ T cells, T cells were treated with MEKi in combination with T cell stimulation signals and assayed for T cell proliferation. Briefly, human CD8+ T cells were purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies human CD8 RosetteSep as per manufacturer's instructions. Purified cells were plated at 200,000 per well in triplicate in 96-well U-bottom plates with 200,000 per well of either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen). MEK inhibitors GDC-0973 and G-38963 were titrated 10-fold from 10 \u03bcM to 0.001 \u03bcM such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl per well. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 \u03bcM HEPES, 55 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. At 48 hours, wells were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi/well of 3H-thymidine and cultured an additional 16 hours prior to freezing and harvest. Data analysis demonstrated that treatment of CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 stimulated T cell activation (closed triangle) as compared to unstimulated T cells (open circle). Treatment of T cells with two different MEK inhibitors reduced the stimulatory effect of anti-CD3 (closed circle, closed square) at all MEKi concentrations tested, with nearly complete inhibition of T cell receptor induced proliferation occurring at 0.01 \u03bcM MEKi treatment (FIG. 4A). In contrast, co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in MEKi treated T cells (closed circle, closed square) was sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEKi on T cell activation (FIG. 4B). These unexpected results demonstrate the novel finding that inhibition of TCR signaling by MEKi treatment can be overcome by providing sufficient T cell co-stimulation which is provided to T cells by antigen presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.",
                                "Without being bound to theory, a key component of co-stimulation is thought to be the activation of PI3 kinase and is provided by CD28 via association of PI3K p85 subunit with its cytoplsmic YMNM motif. PD-1, through its interaction with SHP2, impedes the activity of PI3K. Therefore, blockade of the PDI axis may disinhibit PI3kinase, resulting in enhanced T cell costimulation and provides a means to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEKi on T cell activation. PD-1/-L1 blockade is to enhance co-stimulation under conditions when expression of co-stimulatory ligands such as B7.1 and B7.2 is often limiting such as in most tumors or the tumor microenvironment. Combining MEKi with blockade of the PDI axis should enhance tumor specific T cell immunity by enhancing Ag recognition by the TCR through upregulation of tumor MHC I (enhancing Signal I) by MEKi and by relieving inhibition of PI3K (enhancing Signal 2) through PD1/PDL1 blockade."

Briefly, human monocytes were purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies human monocyte RosetteSep as per manufacturer's instructions. Monocytes were seeded in T175 flasks at approximately 0.5-1.0\u00d7106 per ml in 50 ng/ml human GM-CSF and 100 ng/ml human IL-4 for 7 days total, with half-media exchanges every 2 days. Cells were then harvested and plated at 100,000 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates with or without Pfizer anti-CD40 at 1 g/ml. MEK inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor were titrated 10-fold from 10 M to 0.001p M such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl per well. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were first Fc-receptor blocked (Miltenyi) and then stained using the following antibodies (from BD Biosciences at 1:10, 30 minutes on ice): HLA-DR,-DP,-DQ-FITC, HLA-ABC-PE, CD83-APC, CD14-FITC, CD80-PE, and CD86-APC. Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that the frequency of cells expressing the maturation marker CD83 (FIG. 5A), MHC-II (FIG. 5B), and co-stimulatory molecule CD86 (FIG. 5C) was increased in cells treated with 1 \u03bcM MEKi GDC-0973 as compared to vehicle treated cells. In contrast, cell surface expression of these DC surface activation markers in DCs treated with 1 \u03bcM BRAFi was not upregulated and was similar to vehicle treated cells. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of either MEKi G-38963 (closed square) or MEKi GDC-0973 (closed circle) enhanced the frequency of DCs expressing these surface markers of DC maturation and activation in concentration dependent manner (FIG. 5D-SF). In contrast BRAFi (closed triangle) treatment did not enhance the anti-CD40 co-stimulatory effect. These novel results demonstrate that enhanced maturation and activation of DCs is specific to MEK inhibitor treatment and not due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway. Furthermore, MEKi enhanced activation of human monocyte-derived DCs co-stimulated with anti-CD40 in a concentration dependent manner indicating that MEKi may have an immunomodulatory effect on DCs."

The anti-PD-L1 antibody employed in these experiments was PRO314483, LOT#59554.96, raised against human PD-L1 and recognizes both human and murine PD-L. Briefly, 7 days after treatment, mice were anaesthetized and bled retro-orbitally for serum. Analysis for serum levels of cytokines was conducted using the BioRad Bio-Plex assay and it was determined that the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 was significantly reduced in in vivo models for both melanoma (FIG. 6A) and colorectal (FIG. 6C) tumors. IL-10 levels were decreased with anti-PD-L1 antibody or MEKi treatment alone but were significantly reduced by co-treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Furthermore, serum levels of the murine chemokine KC, homolog of the human chemokine IL-8 that is known to play a role in tumor progression, was also significantly reduced in in vivo models for both melanoma (FIG. 6B) and colorectal (FIG. 6D) tumors with the most significant reduction induced by co-treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies.

                                "To determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies, mouse models for colorectal tumors were treated with the combination treatment. Briefly, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor cells and allowed to grow tumors. When tumor bearing mice achieved a mean tumor volume of 200 mm3 (FIG. 7A) or 450 mm3 (FIG. 7B), mice were randomly assigned to I of 4 treatment groups. Group 1: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally three times a week for 3 weeks plus MCT control vehicle, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 2: received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks; Group 3: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3\u00d7/week\u00d73 plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 4: received 10 mg/kg of an anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes. Blockade of PD-L1 with anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 either in early (FIG. 7A) or in late (FIG. 7B) intervention was highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Treatment with MEKi G-38963 was also highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth either in early or in late intervention and was comparable to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Combination treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and MEKi significantly inhibited tumor growth both in early and late intervention and was significantly more effective than anti-PD-L1 antibodies or MEKi treatment alone. Furthermore, co-treatment at an early stage of tumor growth resulted not only in significant reduction of tumor volume but also demonstrated a sustained response. Early intervention resulted in about a 60% complete response that was maintained for at least 92 days. These results indicate that MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 blockade and therefore worked synergistically with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to inhibit tumor growth.",

To determine if enhanced tumor immunogenicity is due to dependency of PD-L I expression upon MEK activation, activation of dendritic cells was compared when treated with MEKi GDC-0973 alone, anti-PD-L1 antibodies (a chimeric antibody composed of variable regions of MPDL3280A fused to mouse IgG2a constant sequences that contain an Fc mutation to prevent effective binding to Fcgamma receptors) alone or MEKi in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Briefly, mouse bone marrow cells were isolated and seeded at 2\u00d7106 per 10 ml total volume per 10 cm non-tissue culture treated dishes with 40 ng/ml mouse GM-CSF for 7 days. Fresh media was half-exchanged every 2-3 days. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 \u03bcM HEPES, 55 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. On day 7 all cells were harvested and washed, then seeded at 100,000 cells/well in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM, anti-PDLI human/mouse reverse chimera or anti-Ragweed mouse IgG2a isotype control (Genentech PUR 22251) were added at 10 \u03bcg/ml. Prior to adding to cells for a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml each, anti-CD40 clone FGK-45 (Genentech lot 68020-62) was crossed-linked with goat anti-Rat IgG Fc-gamma-receptor (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for one hour. After 48 hours of stimulation, cells were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Samples were first Fc receptor blocked (purified anti-CD16/CD32 from BD Biosciences, 5 \u03bcg/ml) and then stained with I-A/I-E-FITC, H-2 Db/H-2 Kb-biotin (followed by streptavidin-PE), CD11c-APC, CD86-FITC, and CD80-PE (all from BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Treatment with functionally blocking anti-PD-L1 antibodies alone modestly increased DC surface expression of MHC-I (FIG. 15A) however it did not induce expression of DC surface activation markers MHC-II (FIG. 15B), CD80 (FIG. 15C), or CD86 (FIG. 15D). In contrast MEKi treatment enhanced MHC-II, CD80, and CD86 as well as MHC-I expression. Interestingly, combination treatment of MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies did not alter DC surface activation markers as compared to MEKi alone. Similar results were obtained with the addition of the co-stimulatory anti-CD40 antibodies (FIG. 15E-H). These novel findings indicate that MEKi induced activation of DCs independently of its effect on PD-L expression. Altogether these results demonstrate that MEKi increased tumor immunogenicity by mechanisms unique from anti-PDL and provide support for combining MEKi and PD-L blockade for optimal enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.",

Phosphorylation of the substrate is detected and quantified using HTRF reagents supplied by Cisbio. These consist of an anti-GST antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (XL665) and an anti-phospho (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK antibody conjugated to europium-cryptate. These are used at a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml and 0.84 \u03bcg/ml respectively. The anti-phospho antibody recognises ERK1 dually phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204. When both antibodies are bound to ERK1 (i.e. when the substrate is phosphorylated), energy transfer from the cryptate to the allophycocyanin occurs following excitation at 340 nm, resulting in fluorescence being emitted that is proportional to the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced. Fluorescence is detected using a multiwell fluorimeter.",
