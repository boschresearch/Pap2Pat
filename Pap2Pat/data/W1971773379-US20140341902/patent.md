# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The provision of two distinct signals to T-cells is a widely accepted model for lymphocyte activation of resting T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Lafferty et al, Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. ScL 53: 27-42 (1975). This model further provides for the discrimination of self from non-self and immune tolerance. Bretscher et al, Science 169: 1042-1049 (1970); Bretscher, P. A., P.N.A.S. USA 96: 185-190 (1999); Jenkins et al, J. Exp. Med. 165: 302-319 (1987). The primary signal, or antigen specific signal, is transduced through the T-cell receptor (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigen peptide presented in the context of the major histocompatibility-complex (MHC). The second or co-stimulatory signal is delivered to T-cells by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and induce T-cells to promote clonal expansion, cytokine secretion and effector function. Lenschow et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:233 (1996). In the absence of co-stimulation, T-cells can become refractory to antigen stimulation, do not mount an effective immune response, and further may result in exhaustion or tolerance to foreign antigens.

In the two-signal model T-cells receive both positive and negative secondary co-stimulatory signals. The regulation of such positive and negative signals is critical to maximize the host's protective immune responses, while maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Negative secondary signals seem necessary for induction of T-cell tolerance, while positive signals promote T-cell activation. While the simple two-signal model still provides a valid explanation for naive lymphocytes, a host's immune response is a dynamic process, and co-stimulatory signals can also be provided to antigen-exposed T-cells. The mechanism of co-stimulation is of therapeutic interest because the manipulation of co-stimulatory signals has shown to provide a means to either enhance or terminate cell-based immune response. Recently, it has been discovered that T cell dysfunction or anergy occurs concurrently with an induced and sustained expression of the inhibitory receptor, programmed death 1 polypeptide (PD-1). As a result, therapeutic targeting of PD-1 and other molecules which signal through interactions with PD-1, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are an area of intense interest.

PD-L1 is overexpressed in many cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis (Okazaki T et al., Intern. Immun. 2007 19(7):813) (Thompson R H et al., Cancer Res 2006, 66(7):3381). Interestingly, the majority of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes predominantly express PD-1, in contrast to T lymphocytes in normal tissues and peripheral blood T lymphocytes indicating that up-regulation of PD-1 on tumor-reactive T cells can contribute to impaired antitumor immune responses (Blood 2009 114(8):1537). This may be due to exploitation of PD-L1 signaling mediated by PD-L1 expressing tumor cells interacting with PD-1 expressing T cells to result in attenuation of T cell activation and evasion of immune surveillance (Sharpe et al., Nat Rev 2002) (Keir M E et al., 2008 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 26:677). Therefore, inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction may enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of tumors.

The inhibition of PD-1 axis signaling through its direct ligands (e.g., PD-L1, PD-L2) has been proposed as a means to enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g., tumor immunity). Moreover, similar enhancements to T cell immunity have been observed by inhibiting the binding of PD-L1 to the binding partner B7-1. Furthermore, combining inhibition of PD-1 signaling with other signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK pathway, “MEK”) that are deregulated in tumor cells may further enhance treatment efficacy. However, an optimal therapeutic treatment would combine blockade of PD-1 receptor/ligand interaction with an agent that directly inhibited tumor growth, optionally further including unique immune enhancing properties not provided by PD-1 blockade alone. There remains a need for such an optimal therapy for treating, stabilizing, preventing, and/or delaying development of various cancers.

### II. Definitions

The term “PD-1 axis binding antagonist” is a molecule that inhibits the interaction of a PD-1 axis binding partner with either one or more of its binding partner, so as to remove T-cell dysfunction resulting from signaling on the PD-1 signaling axis with a result being to restore or enhance T-cell function (e.g., proliferation, cytokine production, target cell killing). As used herein, a PD-1 axis binding antagonist includes a PD-1 binding antagonist, a PD-L1 binding antagonist and a PD-L2 binding antagonist.

The term “PD-1 binding antagonists” is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-1 with one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-L1, PD-L2. In some embodiments, the PD-1 binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its binding partners. In a specific aspect, the PD-1 binding antagonist inhibits the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and/or PD-L2. For example, PD-1 binding antagonists include anti-PD-1 antibodies, antigen binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 and/or PD-L2. In one embodiment, a PD-1 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling through PD-1 so as render a dysfunctional T-cell less dysfunctional (e.g., enhancing effector responses to antigen recognition). In some embodiments, the PD-1 binding antagonist is an anti-PD-1 antibody. In a specific aspect, a PD-1 binding antagonist is MDX-1106 described herein. In another specific aspect, a PD-1 binding antagonist is Merck 3745 described herein. In another specific aspect, a PD-1 binding antagonist is CT-011 described herein.

The term “PD-L1 binding antagonists” is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L1 with either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1, B7-1. In some embodiments, a PD-L1 binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to its binding partners. In a specific aspect, the PD-L1 binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and/or B7-1. In some embodiments, the PD-L1 binding antagonists include anti-PD-L1 antibodies, antigen binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L1 with one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1, B7-1. In one embodiment, a PD-L1 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling through PD-L1 so as to render a dysfunctional T-cell less dysfunctional (e.g., enhancing effector responses to antigen recognition). In some embodiments, a PD-L1 binding antagonist is an anti-PD-L1 antibody. In a specific aspect, an anti-PD-L1 antibody is YW243.55.S70 described herein. In another specific aspect, an anti-PD-L1 antibody is MDX-1105 described herein. In still another specific aspect, an anti-PD-L1 antibody is MPDL3280A described herein.

The term “PD-L2 binding antagonists” is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L2 with either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In some embodiments, a PD-L2 binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-L2 to its binding partners. In a specific aspect, the PD-L2 binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-L2 to PD-1. In some embodiments, the PD-L2 antagonists include anti-PD-L2 antibodies, antigen binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L2 with either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In one embodiment, a PD-L2 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling through PD-L2 so as render a dysfunctional T-cell less dysfunctional (e.g., enhancing effector responses to antigen recognition). In some embodiments, a PD-L2 binding antagonist is an immunoadhesin.

The term “dysfunction” in the context of immune dysfunction, refers to a state of reduced immune responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. The term includes the common elements of both exhaustion and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur, but the ensuing immune response is ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.

The term “dysfunctional”, as used herein, also includes refractory or unresponsive to antigen recognition, specifically, impaired capacity to translate antigen recognition into down-stream T-cell effector functions, such as proliferation, cytokine production (e.g., IL-2) and/or target cell killing.

The term “anergy” refers to the state of unresponsiveness to antigen stimulation resulting from incomplete or insufficient signals delivered through the T-cell receptor (e.g. increase in intracellular Ca+2 in the absence of ras-activation). T cell anergy can also result upon stimulation with antigen in the absence of co-stimulation, resulting in the cell becoming refractory to subsequent activation by the antigen even in the context of costimulation. The unresponsive state can often be overriden by the presence of Interleukin-2. Anergic T-cells do not undergo clonal expansion and/or acquire effector functions.

The term “exhaustion” refers to T cell exhaustion as a state of T cell dysfunction that arises from sustained TCR signaling that occurs during many chronic infections and cancer. It is distinguished from anergy in that it arises not through incomplete or deficient signaling, but from sustained signaling. It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells. Exhaustion prevents optimal control of infection and tumors. Exhaustion can result from both extrinsic negative regulatory pathways (e.g., immunoregulatory cytokines) as well as cell intrinsic negative regulatory (costimulatory) pathways (PD-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, etc.).

“Enhancing T-cell function” means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a sustained or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or inactive T-cells. Examples of enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion of γ-interferon from CD8+ T-cells, increased proliferation, increased antigen responsiveness (e.g., viral, pathogen, or tumor clearance) relative to such levels before the intervention. In one embodiment, the level of enhancement is as least 50%, alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 120%, 150%, 200%. The manner of measuring this enhancement is known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

A “T cell dysfunctional disorder” is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized by decreased responsiVeness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with inappropriate increased signaling through PD-1. In another embodiment, a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is one in which T-cells are anergic or have decreased ability to secrete cytokines, proliferate, or execute cytolytic activity. In a specific aspect, the decreased responsiveness results in ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor expressing an immunogen. Examples of T cell dysfunctional disorders characterized by T-cell dysfunction include unresolved acute infection, chronic infection and tumor immunity.

“Tumor immunity” refers to the process in which tumors evade immune recognition and clearance. Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is “treated” when such evasion is attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the immune system. Examples of tumor recognition include tumor binding, tumor shrinkage and tumor clearance.

“Immunogenecity” refers to the ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response. Tumors are immunogenic and enhancing tumor immunogenicity aids in the clearance of the tumor cells by the immune response. Examples of enhancing tumor immunogenicity include treatment with anti-PDL antibodies and a MEK inhibitor.

“Sustained response” refers to the sustained effect on reducing tumor growth after cessation of a treatment. For example, the tumor size may remain to be the same or smaller as compared to the size at the beginning of the administration phase. In some embodiments, the sustained response has a duration at least the same as the treatment duration, at least 1.5×, 2.0×, 2.5×, or 3.0× length of the treatment duration.

The term “antibody” includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab′)2, and Fv). The term “immunoglobulin” (Ig) is used interchangeably with “antibody” herein.

The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the α and γ chains and four CH domains for 1.1 and E isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated α, δ, ε, γ and pt, respectively. The γ and a classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2.

The “variable region” or “variable domain” of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as “VH” and “VL”, respectively. These domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.

The term “variable” refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.

The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage-display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Sidhu et al., J. Mol. Biol. 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101(34): 12467-12472 (2004); and Lee et al., J. Immunol. Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO 1998/24893; WO 1996/34096; WO 1996/33735; WO 1991/10741; Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immunol. 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016; Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10: 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368: 856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368: 812-813 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnol. 14: 826 (1996); and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995).

The term “naked antibody” refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

The terms “full-length antibody,” “intact antibody” or “whole antibody” are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an antibody fragment. Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains including an Fc region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.

An “antibody fragment” comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produced two identical antigen-binding fragments, called “Fab” fragments, and a residual “Fc” fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CH1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab′)2 fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab′-SH is the designation herein for Fab′ in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab′)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab′ fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.

“FV” is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

“Single-chain Fv” also abbreviated as “sFv” or “scFv” are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).

“Functional fragments” of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody or the Fc region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues) between the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two “crossover” sFv fragments in which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993).

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is(are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include PRIMATIZED® antibodies wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque monkeys with an antigen of interest. As used herein, “humanized antibody” is used a subset of “chimeric antibodies.”

“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from an HVR (hereinafter defined) of the recipient are replaced by residues from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework (“FR”) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). See also, for example, Vaswani and Hamilton, Ann. Allergy, Asthma & Immunol. 1:105-115 (1998); Harris, Biochem. Soc. Transactions 23:1035-1038 (1995); Hurle and Gross, Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,982,321 and 7,087,409.

A “human antibody” is an antibody that possesses an amino-acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147(1):86-95 (1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 5: 368-74 (2001). Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSE™ technology). See also, for example, Li et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology.

The term “hypervariable region,” “HVR,” or “HV,” when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu, in i Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993); Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).

A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The “contact” HVRs are based on an analysis of the available compleX crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

HVRs may comprise “extended HVRs” as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.

The expression “variable-domain residue-numbering as in Kabat” or “amino-acid-position numbering as in Kabat,” and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a “standard” Kabat numbered sequence.

“Framework” or “FR” residues are those variable-domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined.

A “human consensus framework” or “acceptor human framework” is a framework that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I, kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra. Alternatively, a human consensus framework can be derived from the above in which particular residues, such as when a human framework residue is selected based on its homology to the donor framework by aligning the donor framework sequence with a collection of various human framework sequences. An acceptor human framework “derived from” a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.

A “VH subgroup III consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (HC-FR1) (SEQ ID NO:4), WVRQAPGKGLEWV (HC-FR2), (SEQ ID NO:5), RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR (HC-FR3, SEQ ID NO:6), WGQGTLVTVSA (HC-FR4), (SEQ ID NO:7).

A “VL kappa I consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (LC-FR1) (SEQ ID NO:11), WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (LC-FR2) (SEQ ID NO:12), GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC (LC-FR3) (SEQ ID NO:13), FGQGTKVEIKR (LC-FR4) (SEQ ID NO:14).

An “amino-acid modification” at a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid residue adjacent the specified residue. Insertion “adjacent” to a specified residue means insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.

An “affinity-matured” antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH— and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).

As use herein, the term “specifically binds to” or is “specific for” refers to measurable and reproducible interactions such as binding between a target and an antibody, which is determinative of the presence of the target in the presence of a heterogeneous population of molecules including biological molecules. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to a target (which can be an epitope) is an antibody that binds this target with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other targets. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to a target has a dissociation constant (Kd) of ≦1 μM, ≦100 nM, ≦10 nM, ≦1 nM, or ≦0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to an epitope on a protein that is conserved among the protein from different species. In another embodiment, specific binding can include, but does not require exclusive binding.

As used herein, the term “immunoadhesin” designates antibody-like molecules which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an “adhesin”) with the effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is “heterologous”), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2 (including IgG2A and IgG2B), IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or IgM. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a domain of a polypeptide or antibody described herein in the place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,130 issued Jun. 27, 1995. For example, useful immunoadhesins as second medicaments useful for combination therapy herein include polypeptides that comprise the extracellular or PD-1 binding portions of PD-L1 or PD-L2 or the extracellular or PD-L1 or PD-L2 binding portions of PD-1, fused to a constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence, such as a PD-L1 ECD Fc, a PD-L2 ECD Fc, and a PD-1 ECD-Fc, respectively.

Immunoadhesin combinations of Ig Fc and ECD of cell surface receptors are sometimes termed soluble receptors.

A “fusion protein” and a “fusion polypeptide” refer to a polypeptide having two portions covalently linked together, where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a different property. The property may be a biological property, such as activity in vitro or in vivo. The property may also be simple chemical or physical property, such as binding to a target molecule, catalysis of a reaction, etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a single peptide bond or through a peptide linker but are in reading frame with each other.

A “PD-1 oligopeptide,” “PD-L1 oligopeptide,” or “PD-L2 oligopeptide” is an oligopeptide that binds, preferably specifically, to a PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 negative costimulatory polypeptide, respectively, including a receptor, ligand or signaling component, respectively, as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. Such oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length, alternatively at least about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100 amino acids in length or more. Such oligopeptides may be identified using well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,556,762, 5,750,373, 4,708,871, 4,833,092, 5,223,409, 5,403,484, 5,571,689, 5,663,143; PCT Publication Nos. WO 84/03506 and WO84/03564; Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 81:3998-4002 (1984); Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 82:178-182 (1985); Geysen et al., in Synthetic Peptides as Antigens, 130-149 (1986); Geysen et al., I Immunol. Meth., 102:259-274 (1987); Schoofs et al., J. Immunol., 140:611-616 (1988), Cwirla, S. E. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6378 (1990); Lowman, H. B. et al. Biochemistry, 30:10832 (1991); Clackson, T. et al. Nature, 352: 624 (1991); Marks, J. D. et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991); Kang, A. S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:8363 (1991), and Smith, G. P., Current Opin. Biotechnol., 2:668 (1991).

A “blocking” antibody or an “antagonist” antibody is one that inhibits or reduces a biological activity of the antigen it binds. In some embodiments, blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen. The anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the invention block the signaling through PD-1 so as to restore a functional response by T-cells (e.g., proliferation, cytokine production, target cell killing) from a dysfunctional state to antigen stimulation.

An “agonist” or activating antibody is one that enhances or initiates signaling by the antigen to which it binds. In some embodiments, agonist antibodies cause or activate signaling without the presence of the natural ligand.

The term “Fc region” herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG 1, IgG2 (IgG2A, IgG2B), IgG3 and IgG4.

“Fc receptor” or “FcR” describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see M. Daëron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991); Capel et al., Immunomethods 4: 25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term “FcR” herein.

The term “Fc receptor” or “FcR” also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus. Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117: 587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24: 249 (1994). Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie and Ward, Immunol. Today 18: (12): 592-8 (1997); Ghetie et al., Nature Biotechnology 15 (7): 637-40 (1997); Hinton et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279 (8): 6213-6 (2004); WO 2004/92219 (Hinton et al.). Binding to FcRn in vivo and serum half-life of human FcRn high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates to which the polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants which improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also, e.g., Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).

The phrase “substantially reduced,” or “substantially different,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.

The term “substantially similar” or “substantially the same,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.

“Carriers” as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS™

A “package insert” refers to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications customarily included in commercial packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications, other medicaments to be combined with the packaged product, and/or warnings concerning the use of such medicaments, etc.

As used herein, the term “treatment” refers to clinical intervention designed to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of disease progression, ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. For example, an individual is successfully “treated” if one or more symptoms associated with cancer are mitigated or eliminated, including, but are not limited to, reducing the proliferation of (or destroying) cancerous cells, decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of individuals.

As used herein, “delaying progression of a disease” means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease (such as cancer). This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. For example, a late stage cancer, such as development of metastasis, may be delayed.

An “effective amount” is at least the minimum concentration required to effect a measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder. An effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as via targeting, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. In the case of cancer or tumor, an effective amount of the drug may have the effect in reducing the number of cancer cells; reducing the tumor size; inhibiting (i.e., slow to some extent or desirably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and desirably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibiting to some extent tumor growth; and/or relieving to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an “effective amount” may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.

As used herein, “in conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality in addition to another treatment modality. As such, “in conjunction with” refers to administration of one treatment modality before, during, or after administration of the other treatment modality to the individual.

As used herein, “complete response” or “CR” refers to disappearance of all target lesions; “partial response” or “PR” refers to at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD; and “stable disease” or “SD” refers to neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started.

As used herein, “progressive disease” or “PD” refers to at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the presence of one or more new lesions.

As used herein, “progression free survival” (PFS) refers to the length of time during and after treatment during which the disease being treated (e.g., cancer) does not get worse. Progression-free survival may include the amount of time patients have experienced a complete response or a partial response, as well as the amount of time patients have experienced stable disease.

As used herein, “overall response rate” (ORR) refers to the sum of complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate.

Briefly, human melanoma cell lines (Malme-3M, A2058, A375, HS294T, SK23, SKMEL-28, 537 MeI, RPMI-795) and human colorectal cell lines (Colo 320 DM, Colo 205, WiDr, Colo 741, RKO, DLD-1, HM7, HCT-15) were treated with 1 micromolar MEKi GDC-0973 or G-38963, BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) GDC-0879, or DMSO vehicle for 24 hours. Following treatment, cells were stained for surface MHC Class I expression with an antibody against HLA-A,B,C for subsequent FACS analysis. Data shown is for treatment with MEKi GDC-0973. Labeled isotype-matched antibodies were used to determine the level of non-specific staining. Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that cell surface expression of MHC-I was upregulated in MEKi treated cells as compared to vehicle treated cells (FIG. 1A). In contrast, cell surface expression of MHC-I in BRAFi treated cells was not upregulated as compared to vehicle treated cells (FIG. 2). These results demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I in both melanoma and colorectal tumor cells is specific to MEK inhibition and not due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway.

To determine if treatment with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) enhanced immunogenicity of mouse tumor cells similarly to human tumor cells, surface expression of MHC-I on mouse tumor cell lines treated with MEKi GDC-0973 was assayed. Briefly, mouse melanoma cell lines (MC38 and B16.F10) and a mouse colorectal cell line (CT26) were treated with MEKi GDC-0973, G-38963 or vehicle. Briefly, cells were stimulated for 24 hours with 1 micromolar MEK inhibitor or DMSO vehicle control. Following treatment, cells were surfaced stained with an antibody against MHC-I (H-2D) and expression was assayed by subsequent FACS analysis. Labeled isotype-matched antibodies were used to determine the level of non-specific staining. Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that cell surface expression of MHC-I was upregulated in MEKi treated cells (data shown is for MEKi GDC-0973) as compared to vehicle treated cells (FIG. 1B). These results demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I occurred across several melanoma and colorectal tumor cell lines regardless of mouse or human origin.

To determine if enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I is specific to tumor cells, the effect of MEKi treatment on MHC-I expression on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) was assayed. Briefly, PMBCS were isolated from whole blood by first diluting it with an equal volume of room temperature PBS and subsequent overlay onto Ficoll-filled Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One). Post-centrifugation, the PBMC interface was then washed twice and resuspended in culture media (RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μM HEPES, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids). Cells were plated in 6 well plates at 4×106 per well with a total of 4 ml per well. MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 was added at either 1 μM or 3 μM. Cells were harvested 24 hours later and distributed to a 96-well V-bottom plate for FACS staining. Cells were stained with the following antibodies (all from BD Biosciences, at 1:10 for 30 minutes on ice): CD3-FITC, HLA-ABC-PE, CD4-APC, CD19-FITC, and CD14-FITC. Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that cell surface expression of MHC-I was not upregulated in CD4+ T cells (FIG. 3A), CD8+ T cells (FIG. 3B), B cells (FIG. 3C), or monocytes (FIG. 3D) treated with 1 μM MEKi GDC-0973 or 3 μM MEKi GDC-0973 as compared to vehicle treated cells. These results demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I by MEK inhibitor treatment is specific to tumor cells.

### Co-Stimulatory Signals Made T Cells Resistant to TCR Signaling Inactivation by MEK Inhibitor

Recent studies have shown that MEK inhibitor treatment impairs T lymphocyte function (Boni et al., Cancer Res., 70(13), 2010). To confirm that MEK inhibitor treatment impaired CD8+ T cells, T cells were treated with MEKi in combination with T cell stimulation signals and assayed for T cell proliferation. Briefly, human CD8+ T cells were purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies human CD8 RosetteSep as per manufacturer's instructions. Purified cells were plated at 200,000 per well in triplicate in 96-well U-bottom plates with 200,000 per well of either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen). MEK inhibitors GDC-0973 and G-38963 were titrated 10-fold from 10 μM to 0.001 μM such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total volume of 200 μl per well. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μM HEPES, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. At 48 hours, wells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of 3H-thymidine and cultured an additional 16 hours prior to freezing and harvest. Data analysis demonstrated that treatment of CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 stimulated T cell activation (closed triangle) as compared to unstimulated T cells (open circle). Treatment of T cells with two different MEK inhibitors reduced the stimulatory effect of anti-CD3 (closed circle, closed square) at all MEKi concentrations tested, with nearly complete inhibition of T cell receptor induced proliferation occurring at 0.01 μM MEKi treatment (FIG. 4A). In contrast, co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in MEKi treated T cells (closed circle, closed square) was sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEKi on T cell activation (FIG. 4B). These unexpected results demonstrate the novel finding that inhibition of TCR signaling by MEKi treatment can be overcome by providing sufficient T cell co-stimulation which is provided to T cells by antigen presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

Without being bound to theory, a key component of co-stimulation is thought to be the activation of PI3 kinase and is provided by CD28 via association of PI3K p85 subunit with its cytoplsmic YMNM motif. PD-1, through its interaction with SHP2, impedes the activity of PI3K. Therefore, blockade of the PDI axis may disinhibit PI3kinase, resulting in enhanced T cell costimulation and provides a means to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEKi on T cell activation. PD-1/-L1 blockade is to enhance co-stimulation under conditions when expression of co-stimulatory ligands such as B7.1 and B7.2 is often limiting such as in most tumors or the tumor microenvironment. Combining MEKi with blockade of the PDI axis should enhance tumor specific T cell immunity by enhancing Ag recognition by the TCR through upregulation of tumor MHC I (enhancing Signal I) by MEKi and by relieving inhibition of PI3K (enhancing Signal 2) through PD1/PDL1 blockade.

### MEK Inhibitor Specifically Enhanced Maturation and Activation of Dendritic Cells

To determine if MEK inhibitor treatment specifically enhanced tumor immunogenicity by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs), monocyte-derived dendritic cells were treated with increasing concentration of MEKi GDC-0973, MEKi GDC-38963 or BRAFi GDC-0879 in combination with antibodies to the DC co-stimulatory molecule CD40. Briefly, human monocytes were purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies human monocyte RosetteSep as per manufacturer's instructions. Monocytes were seeded in T175 flasks at approximately 0.5-1.0×106 per ml in 50 ng/ml human GM-CSF and 100 ng/ml human IL-4 for 7 days total, with half-media exchanges every 2 days. Cells were then harvested and plated at 100,000 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates with or without Pfizer anti-CD40 at 1 g/ml. MEK inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor were titrated 10-fold from 10 M to 0.001p M such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total volume of 200 μl per well. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were first Fc-receptor blocked (Miltenyi) and then stained using the following antibodies (from BD Biosciences at 1:10, 30 minutes on ice): HLA-DR,-DP,-DQ-FITC, HLA-ABC-PE, CD83-APC, CD14-FITC, CD80-PE, and CD86-APC. Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that the frequency of cells expressing the maturation marker CD83 (FIG. 5A), MHC-II (FIG. 5B), and co-stimulatory molecule CD86 (FIG. 5C) was increased in cells treated with 1 μM MEKi GDC-0973 as compared to vehicle treated cells. In contrast, cell surface expression of these DC surface activation markers in DCs treated with 1 μM BRAFi was not upregulated and was similar to vehicle treated cells. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of either MEKi G-38963 (closed square) or MEKi GDC-0973 (closed circle) enhanced the frequency of DCs expressing these surface markers of DC maturation and activation in concentration dependent manner (FIG. 5D-SF). In contrast BRAFi (closed triangle) treatment did not enhance the anti-CD40 co-stimulatory effect. These novel results demonstrate that enhanced maturation and activation of DCs is specific to MEK inhibitor treatment and not due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway. Furthermore, MEKi enhanced activation of human monocyte-derived DCs co-stimulated with anti-CD40 in a concentration dependent manner indicating that MEKi may have an immunomodulatory effect on DCs.

### Co-Treatment with MEK Inhibitor and Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies Reduced Serum Levels of Cytokines that Promote Tumor Growth

Due to the novel observation that MEKi treatment enhanced T cell and DC activation in the presence of a co-stimulator, MEKi G-38963 was used in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to determine if MEKi could enhance the anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment and modulate cytokine levels in tumor bearing animals. The anti-PD-L1 antibody employed in these experiments was PRO314483, LOT#59554.96, raised against human PD-L1 and recognizes both human and murine PD-L. Briefly, 7 days after treatment, mice were anaesthetized and bled retro-orbitally for serum. Analysis for serum levels of cytokines was conducted using the BioRad Bio-Plex assay and it was determined that the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 was significantly reduced in in vivo models for both melanoma (FIG. 6A) and colorectal (FIG. 6C) tumors. IL-10 levels were decreased with anti-PD-L1 antibody or MEKi treatment alone but were significantly reduced by co-treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Furthermore, serum levels of the murine chemokine KC, homolog of the human chemokine IL-8 that is known to play a role in tumor progression, was also significantly reduced in in vivo models for both melanoma (FIG. 6B) and colorectal (FIG. 6D) tumors with the most significant reduction induced by co-treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. These results indicate that combination treatment of anti-PD-L1 antibodies and MEKi inhibits release of cytokines that promote tumor growth.

### Example 5

**MEK Inhibition Enhanced Anti-Tumor Activity of Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies in Colorectal Tumors In Vivo**

To determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies, mouse models for colorectal tumors were treated with the combination treatment. Briefly, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor cells and allowed to grow tumors. When tumor bearing mice achieved a mean tumor volume of 200 mm3 (FIG. 7A) or 450 mm3 (FIG. 7B), mice were randomly assigned to I of 4 treatment groups. Group 1: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally three times a week for 3 weeks plus MCT control vehicle, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 2: received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks; Group 3: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3×/week×3 plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 4: received 10 mg/kg of an anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes. Blockade of PD-L1 with anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 either in early (FIG. 7A) or in late (FIG. 7B) intervention was highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Treatment with MEKi G-38963 was also highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth either in early or in late intervention and was comparable to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Combination treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and MEKi significantly inhibited tumor growth both in early and late intervention and was significantly more effective than anti-PD-L1 antibodies or MEKi treatment alone. Furthermore, co-treatment at an early stage of tumor growth resulted not only in significant reduction of tumor volume but also demonstrated a sustained response. Early intervention resulted in about a 60% complete response that was maintained for at least 92 days. These results indicate that MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 blockade and therefore worked synergistically with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to inhibit tumor growth.

To further determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies, mouse models for colorectal tumors were treated with the combination treatment using a different MEK inhibitor, MEKi GDC-0973, in two different studies.

For the first study, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 μL of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3, they were randomly assigned to one of nine different treatment groups on experimental day 0 and treatment was initiated on experimental day I. Groups of 10 mice were orally given the following in a volume of 200 μl daily for 21 days: Group 1 received MCT vehicle; Group 2 received 0.5 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 3 received 1.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 4 received 2.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 5 received 3.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 6 received 4.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 7 received 5.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 8 received 6.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; and Group 9 received 7.5 mg/kg GDC-0973.

For the second study, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 μL of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3, they were randomly assigned to one of six different treatment groups on experimental day 0 and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were given the following: Group 1 received MCT vehicle orally in 200 uL volume daily for 21 days and 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3 times per week; Group 2 received 7.5 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; Group 3 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week; Group 4 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody*PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 1.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; Group 5 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 3.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; and Group 6 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 6.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days. The anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 was a reverse chimera, containing the human variable region of MPDL3280A and the murine constant region of IgG2A, with an effector-less Fc D265A/N297A substitution in the constant region.

For both studies, mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes two to three times per week for the duration of the study. For measurement of tumor growth, tumor volume was measured using UltraCal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-11; Fred V. Fowler Company; Newton, Mass.) with length and width measurements perpendicular to one another, and tumor volume was calculated using the equation:

Tumor Volume(mm3)=(Length×Width2)×0.5

For measurement of body weights, mice were weighed using an Adventura Pro AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation; Pine Brook, N.J.). Percent body weight change was calculated using the equation:

Body weight change (%)=[(WeightDay new−WeightDay 0)/WeightDay 0]×100

Data was analyzed using R, version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 2008; R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria), and the mixed models were fit within R using the nlme package, version 3.1-96 (Pinheiro J et al., R package version 3. 2009, 1-96). Plotting was performed in Prism, version 5.0b for Mac (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, Calif.). A mixed modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro J et al., Statistics and Computing, Springer. 2010). This approach addressed both repeated measurements and modest dropouts before study end for reasons classifiable statistically as missing at random (MAR). The fixed effect changes in log2 (volume) by time and dose are modeled as the sum of the main effects and interaction of a natural cubic regression spline basis in time with an auto-determined natural spline basis in dose. Intercepts and growth rates (slopes) were assumed to vary randomly by animal. Tumor growth inhibition as a percentage of the control-treated group (% TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area under the fitted curve (AUC) for the respective treatment group per day in relation to the control while the control treated mice were still on study, using the equation:

% TGI=100×(1−AUCdose/AUCvehicles)

Complete Response (CR) was defined as an individual animal whose tumor volume fell below the Limit of Detection (LOD), at any time during the study. Partial Response (PR) was defined as an individual animal whose tumor volume decreased by 50% of its initial tumor volume at any time during the study. Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the sum of the complete and partial responses.

Time To Progression 5X (TTP5X) was defined as the time in days for a group's fitted tumor volume (based upon the mixed modeling analysis described above) to exceed 5 times the starting volume, rounded to the nearest half day and reported as the TTP5X for that group. Linear mixed-effects analysis was also employed to analyze the repeated measurement of body weight changes from the same animals over time.

Treatment with increasing concentrations of MEKi GDC-0973 suppressed tumor growth with maximal inhibition demonstrated by the 7.5 mg/kg GDC-0973 treatment group at 20 days post-treatment (FIG. 8A, Table 2).

Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody and MEKi GDC-0973 demonstrated enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies or MEKi GDC-0973 alone (FIG. 8B, Table 3). Furthermore, lower dosage concentrations of MEKi GDC-0973 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg) were more effective at suppressing tumor growth when used in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody as compared to when a higher dosage concentration of MEKi GDC-0973 was used alone (7.5 mg/kg) (FIGS. 8A and B, Table 3).

Further studies were conducted to determine if additional MEK inhibitors (G02443714, G02442104, and G00039805) also enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies when used for combination treatment in a mouse model for colorectal tumors.

For combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor G02443714, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 μL of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3, they were randomly assigned to one of four different treatment groups on experimental day 0 and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were given the following: Group 1 received MCT vehicle orally in 200 uL volume daily for 21 days and 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3 times per week; Group 2 received 25 mg/kg G02443714 orally daily for 21 days; Group 3 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week; and Group 4 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 25 mg/kg G02443714 orally daily for 21 days. G02443714 as well as oral vehicle (MCT) were dosed orally by gavage four hours prior to administration of anti-PD-L1 and/or isotype control antibody.

For combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor G02442104, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 μL of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3, they were randomly assigned to one of four different treatment groups on experimental day 0 and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were given the following: Group 1 received MCT vehicle orally in 200 uL volume daily for 21 days and 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3 times per week; Group 2 received 25 mg/kg G02442104 orally daily for 21 days; Group 3 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week; and Group 4 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intrapeiitoneally 3 times per week and 25 mg/kg G02442104 orally daily for 21 days. G02442104 as well as oral vehicle (MCT) were dosed orally by gavage four hours prior to administration of anti-PD-L1 and/or isotype control antibody.

For combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor G00039805, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 μL of HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3, they were randomly assigned to one of four different treatment groups on experimental day 0 and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were given the following: Group 1 received MCT vehicle orally in 200 uL volume daily for 21 days and 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3 times per week; Group 2 received 100 mg/kg G00039805 orally daily for 21 days; Group 3 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week; and Group 4 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 100 mg/kg G00039805 orally daily for 21 days. G00039805 as well as oral vehicle (MCT) were dosed orally by gavage four hours prior to administration of anti-PD-L1 and/or isotype control antibody.

For all three combination studies with G02443714, G02442104, or G00039805, mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes two to three times per week for the duration of the study. For measurement of tumor growth, tumor volume was measured using UltraCal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler Company; Newton, Mass.) with length and width measurements perpendicular to one another, and tumor volume was calculated using the equation:

Tumor Volume (mm3)=(Length×Width2)×0.5

For measurement of body weights, mice were weighed using an Adventura Pro AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation; Pine Brook, N.J.). Percent body weight change was calculated using the equation:

Body weight change (%)=[(WeightDay new−WeightDay 0)/WeightDay 0]×100

Data was analyzed using R, version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 2008; R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria), and the mixed models were fit within R using the nlme package, version 3.1-96 (Pinheiro J et al., R package version 3. 2009, 1-96). Plotting was performed in Prism, version 5.0b for Mac (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, Calif.). A mixed modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro J et al., Statistics and Computing, Springer. 2010).

Intercepts and growth rates (slopes) were assumed to vary randomly by animal. Tumor growth inhibition as a percentage of the control-treated group (% TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area under the fitted curve (AUC) for the respective treatment group per day in relation to the control while the control treated mice were still on study, using the equation:

% TGI=100×(1−AUCdose/AUCvehicles)

Complete Response (CR) was defined as an individual animal whose tumor volume fell below the Limit of Detection (LOD), at any time during the study. Partial Response (PR) was defined as an individual animal whose tumor volume decreased by 50% of its initial tumor volume at any time during the study. Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the sum of the complete and partial responses.

Time To Progression 5X (TTP5X) was defined as the time in days for a group's fitted tumor volume (based upon the mixed modeling analysis described above) to exceed 5 times the starting volume, rounded to the nearest half day and reported as the TTP5X for that group. Linear mixed-effects analysis was also employed to analyze the repeated measurement of body weight changes from the same animals over time.

Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody and G02443714 resulted in enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies or G02443714 alone with a 20% partial response observed at 18 days (FIG. 9). Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody and G02442104 also resulted in enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment with anti-PD-L antibodies or MEKi G02442104 alone with a 40% partial response and 10% complete response observed at 37.5 days (FIG. 10). In addition, combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody and G00039805 resulted in enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies or MEKi GOQ039805 alone with a 30% partial response observed at 22 days (FIG. 1). Altogether these results demonstrate that a variety of MEK inhibitors can enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-L1 antibodies to inhibit tumor growth.

**MEK Inhibition Enhanced Anti-Tumor Activity of Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies in Melanoma Tumors In Vivo**

To determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies, mouse models for melanoma tumors were treated with the combination treatment. Briefly, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor cells and allowed to grow tumors. When tumor bearing mice achieved a mean tumor volume of 100-200 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Group 1: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus MCT control vehicle, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 2: received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks; Group 3: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PRO67181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 4: received 10 mg/kg of an anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes. Blockade of PD-L1 with anti-PD-L1 antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 in Cloudman S91 (FIG. 12) melanoma tumors was effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Treatment with MEKi G-38963 was also highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth (FIG. 12) and was comparable to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Combination treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and MEKi significantly inhibited tumor growth in both melanoma cell lines. In contrast, Temodar, a chemotherapeutic agent, when used in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies inhibited the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-L 1 antibodies (FIG. 13). Similar results were obtained when an antibody that blocks the T cell OX40 co-stimulatory molecule was used in combination with the MEK inhibitor G-38963 (FIG. 14). These results indicate that MEKi specifically enhanced the anti-tumor activity of PD-L1 blockade and therefore worked synergistically with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to inhibit melanoma tumor growth.

**MEK Inhibitor Increased Activation of Dendritic Cells Independently of PDL1 Antibody Activity**

Previous studies have indicated that MEK inhibition can augment immune function by downregulation of surface PD-L1 suggesting that the effects of MEKi were mediated via alterations in PD-L1 expression. To determine if enhanced tumor immunogenicity is due to dependency of PD-L I expression upon MEK activation, activation of dendritic cells was compared when treated with MEKi GDC-0973 alone, anti-PD-L1 antibodies (a chimeric antibody composed of variable regions of MPDL3280A fused to mouse IgG2a constant sequences that contain an Fc mutation to prevent effective binding to Fcgamma receptors) alone or MEKi in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Briefly, mouse bone marrow cells were isolated and seeded at 2×106 per 10 ml total volume per 10 cm non-tissue culture treated dishes with 40 ng/ml mouse GM-CSF for 7 days. Fresh media was half-exchanged every 2-3 days. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μM HEPES, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids. On day 7 all cells were harvested and washed, then seeded at 100,000 cells/well in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 was added at a final concentration of 1 μM, anti-PDLI human/mouse reverse chimera or anti-Ragweed mouse IgG2a isotype control (Genentech PUR 22251) were added at 10 μg/ml. Prior to adding to cells for a final concentration of 1 μg/ml each, anti-CD40 clone FGK-45 (Genentech lot 68020-62) was crossed-linked with goat anti-Rat IgG Fc-gamma-receptor (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for one hour. After 48 hours of stimulation, cells were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Samples were first Fc receptor blocked (purified anti-CD16/CD32 from BD Biosciences, 5 μg/ml) and then stained with I-A/I-E-FITC, H-2 Db/H-2 Kb-biotin (followed by streptavidin-PE), CD11c-APC, CD86-FITC, and CD80-PE (all from BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Treatment with functionally blocking anti-PD-L1 antibodies alone modestly increased DC surface expression of MHC-I (FIG. 15A) however it did not induce expression of DC surface activation markers MHC-II (FIG. 15B), CD80 (FIG. 15C), or CD86 (FIG. 15D). In contrast MEKi treatment enhanced MHC-II, CD80, and CD86 as well as MHC-I expression. Interestingly, combination treatment of MEKi and anti-PD-L1 antibodies did not alter DC surface activation markers as compared to MEKi alone. Similar results were obtained with the addition of the co-stimulatory anti-CD40 antibodies (FIG. 15E-H). These novel findings indicate that MEKi induced activation of DCs independently of its effect on PD-L expression. Altogether these results demonstrate that MEKi increased tumor immunogenicity by mechanisms unique from anti-PDL and provide support for combining MEKi and PD-L blockade for optimal enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.

**MEK Assay (MEK Activity Assay)**

Constitutively activated human mutant MEK1 expressed in insect cells is used as source of enzymatic activity at a final concentration in the kinase assay of 62.5 nM.

The assay is carried out for 30 minutes in the presence of 50 μM ATP using recombinant GST-ERKl produced in E. Coli as substrate. Phosphorylation of the substrate is detected and quantified using HTRF reagents supplied by Cisbio. These consist of an anti-GST antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (XL665) and an anti-phospho (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK antibody conjugated to europium-cryptate. The anti-phospho antibody recognises ERK I dually phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204. When both antibodies are bound to ERK1 (i.e. when the substrate is phosphorylated), energy transfer from the cryptate to the allophycocyanin occurs following excitation at 340 nm, resulting in fluorescence being emitted that is proportional to the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced. Fluorescence is detected using a multiwell fluorimeter.

Compounds are diluted in DMSO prior to addition to assay buffer and the final DMSO concentration in the assay is 1%.

The IC50 is defined as the concentration at which a given compound achieves 50% inhibition of control. IC50 values are calculated using the XLfit software package (version 2.0.5).
