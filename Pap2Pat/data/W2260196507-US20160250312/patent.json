                "This invention relates to antigenic compositions or vaccines comprising a viral vector for eliciting an immune response against Plasmodium infection, in particular for prevention or treatment of malaria.",
                "Malaria is a serious and life-threatening mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. Whilst preventative small molecule based medicines exist to prevent malaria, such as chloroquine, they can be associated with significant side-effects, they are unsuitable for long-term use, and drug resistance is increasingly problematic. Vaccination programs have been proven to be effective in reduction and eradication of various diseases worldwide. The aim is to develop an effective malaria vaccine, which is urgently needed. However, current single-component vaccines lack sufficient efficacy for deployment in the field. The two leading malaria vaccine candidates, RTS, S and ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP, are both sub-unit vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic phase of malaria. Whilst neither vaccine currently provides optimal protective efficacy for deployment in endemic countries [1-4], they both demonstrate the strength of targeting the pre-erythrocytic phase, as no blood-stage vaccine has progressed as far in clinical development [5]. Vaccination with irradiated sporozoites delivered by mosquito bite has been considered the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 of malaria vaccines, as whilst it is impractical for deployment, this regimen has repeatedly shown sterile protection in vaccinated volunteers [6-12]. The increased efficacy of irradiated sporozoite immunization over sub-unit vaccines is likely because immune responses are induced to a broad range of antigenic targets. However, perhaps not only multiple targets are needed to create an efficacious sub-unit vaccine, but also better targets than those traditionally focused on (e.g. CSP and TRAP). Over 5000 different proteins are expressed throughout the Plasmodium life-cycle, leading to a high probability that a better target antigen than CSP or TRAP may exist, or a target antigen to be used along side CSP or TRAP in a multi-component vaccination strategy.",
                "The problem with identifying suitable protective liver-stage antigens for use in a liver-stage vaccine is that there is no suitable small animal model of P.falciparum infection. There are rodent malaria models in mice but these are divergent from P. falciparum and many antigens in P. falciparum have no homologues in the rodent parasites. Furthermore hundreds or perhaps thousands of the 5000 or so genes in the P. falciparum genome are likely expressed in the liver and there has been no way of finding out which of these is a good vaccine antigen. However, it is likely that only a small number of the many genes expressed in the liver by P. falciparum produce proteins that end up as peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the infected liver cell surface. These are the potential targets of vaccine-induced T cells whereas antigens the do not reach the surface in MHC molecules cannot be protective when using a liver-stage vaccine. Because parasite antigens in the liver are inside a parasitophorous vacuole, which is surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole membrane most parasite antigens will be unable to reach the liver cell cytoplasm where they can be degraded, loaded on the MHC molecules and transported to the hepatocyte surface. Because it is not possible to identify the MHC-peptide complexes on the liver-cell surface directly, it has not been possible to determine which P. falciparum antigens can be a suitable liver-stage vaccine antigen.",
                "LSA-1 was one of the first liver-stage proteins identified and one of the only known liver-stage specific proteins. LSA1 is well conserved amongst P. falciparum isolates [12], and is critical for late-liver stage development [13]. The likely function of PfLSA1 is in the transition from the liver-stage to the blood-stage, as it is expressed abundantly in the PV as flocculent material surrounding merozoites. It has been associated with protection in studies of natural immunity and in volunteers vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites [14-18]. A particularly strong association was found when HLA-B53-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognized a conserved epitope of PfLSA1, providing a molecular basis for the association of HLA-B53 with resistance to severe malaria in Africa [19]. A clinical trial of recombinant protein PfLSA1 administered with either of the adjuvants AS01 or AS02 (GSK) provided no protection against sporozoite challenge [20] probably because no CD8 T cells which could target the infected liver cell were induced in this trial. Another clinical trial of a polyprotein construct expressing six antigens including PfLSA1, delivered in a FP9-MVA prime-boost regimen, also demonstrated no efficacy and minimal immunogenicity [21]. Such failures highlight our historic inability to predict the effect of potentially promising vaccine candidates and the best method of delivery in order to provide protective immunity. A major challenge in identifying an immunogenic and protective liver-stage antigen has been the lack of a suitable pre-clinical assay.",
                "Therefore, it would be desirable to provide alternative antigens, and improved delivery and vaccination methods for eliciting a protective immune response against malaria.",

                "The antigenic composition or vaccine may be capable of eliciting a protective immune response against malaria in a subject.",
                "Despite thousands of potential antigens being identified previously, including PfLSA1, the use of these antigens to provide a protective immune response has been unpredictable and has so far provided disappointing efficacy. The present invention has used new methodology to identify key candidate antigens that can be used in a viral vector delivery system to produce a protective immune response. The inventors have now devised a new solution to this problem that allows liver-stage antigens to be prioritised for inclusion in a liver-stage vaccine and even tested for efficacy in mice. In brief the method involves selection candidate antigens, expressing these in potent T cell inducing viral vectors, especially adenovirus and MVA vectors, and then inserting the gene for the same antigen into a transgenic Plasmodium berghei rodent parasite. These transgenic P. berghei parasite can then be used to test the efficacy of the viral vectored vaccine expressing the same antigen in mice. The results show a striking hierarchy of protective efficacy of leading candidate antigens with the surprising results that two antigens PfLSA-1 and LSAP2 show outstanding protective efficacy, PfUIS3 and PfI0580c show moderate protective efficacy and other leading antigens such as TRAP show little or no protective efficacy.",

The sequences were analysed using the SignalP 3.0 [1] and TMHMM Servers from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) to generate a predicted structure. A number of modifications were made to the original sequences in order to aid production of the virally vectored vaccines, and to increase the insert expression and immunogenicity in mammalian cells. These modifications were the deletion of repetitive regions of sequence and the addition of the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence (GenBank Accession K03021) [2] upstream. Genes were synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies, New York USA), with a number of further modifications requested. The antigen sequence, or tPA leader sequence, was preceded by the Kozak sequence to aid translation in mammalian cells [3] and the Kpn1 restriction enzyme site for cloning into the viral vectors. At the 3\u2032 DNA appendix, a STOP codon and the Not1 restriction enzyme site were added. No sequences contained the Vaccinia virus early gene transcription termination signal 5\u2032-TTTTTNT-3\u2032 [4]. Finally, the sequences were codon optimized for expression in human cells.",

HHD mice should contain human \u03b232m, human HLA-A2 (\u03b11 and \u03b12 domains) and mouse H-2Db (\u03b13, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains). However, the genotyping results indicated that whilst they do contain HLA-A2, they actually contain mouse \u03b22m and not human \u03b22m. Flow cytometry staining confirmed lack of expression of H-2b compared to C57BL/6 mice, and a low level expression of HLA-A2 using the antibodies to H-2Kb (AF6.88.5.5.3) and HLA-A2 (BB7.2). This also confirmed the finding that HHD mice contain mouse rather than human \u03b22m, as \u03b22m is essential for cell surface expression of MHC molecules. Nevertheless, these mice were able to generate HLA-A2 specific responses with an Influenza A HLA-A2-restricted epitope.",

Chick Embryo Fibroblasts (CEFs) (obtained from the Pirbright Institute, Compton, UK) were maintained and infected with MVA expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP). These cells were then transfected with the MVA-TD-GFP-[antigen] plasmid 90 minutes later, which enables homologous recombination to occur between the MVA virus and the plasmid. As the plasmid is circular, a single crossover event occurs resulting in a large unstable intermediate product containing the entire plasmid and MVA parental genome. This unstable product then resolves into either the recombinant markerless MVA or the parental MVA containing RFP. After incubation of the plasmid with the virus in CEFs, cells were sorted using a MoFlo cell sorter. The unstable intermediate products expressing both GFP and RFP were collected and the lysate used to infect CEFs again. Successful recombinant MVAs containing the antigen were selected by repeated rounds of plaque picking, initially selecting GFP and RFP double positive cells followed later by the selection of colourless plaques. The virus was then bulked up and purified, followed by PCR analysis and titration (pfu).",

The donor mouse was then cardiac bled, however in this case the syringe was lined with 300 U/ml heparin to prevent the blood clotting. The blood was diluted to 1% parasitaemia and 100 \u03bcl was injected i.p. into two recipient mice. This equates to approximately 107 pRBCs injected into each recipient mouse. Three days after the recipient mice had been inoculated they were anaesthetized with 50-100 \u03bcl i.m. of a mix of 2% Rompun solution (20 mg/ml xylazine), 100mg/ml Ketaset (ketamine) and PBS in a ratio of 1:2:3 and fed to a pot of starved 4-7 day old female Anopheles stephensi mosquitos for approximately ten minutes. During the feed a drop of blood was taken to determine parasitaemia, and another drop to determine exflagellation. Exflagellation was measured by adding one drop of room temperature exflaggelation medium to the blood, covering with a cover slip and viewing under a light microscope at 40\u00d7.",

At ten to twelve days post-feed mosquito midguts can be dissected to determine the oocyst number. At 21 days post-feed mosquito salivary glands were dissected to obtain infectious sporozoites (21 days is the peak time-point for sporozoite viability, however infectious sporozoites can be obtained from 18 to 28 days post-feed).",

Mosquitoes were fed on parasite-infected mice and the salivary glands were dissected 21 days post-feed using a dissecting microscope and two 1 ml insulin syringes. The salivary glands were gently dissociated using a tissue homogenizer with RPMI-1640 to release the sporozoites. The sporozoites were then counted using a haemocytometer and diluted to 10 000 sporozoites/ml in RPMI-1640. To infect mice, 1000 sporozoites (100 \u03bcl ) were injected i.v. into the lateral tail vein. Mice were monitored from six days after injection via thin blood films and once parasitaemia was between 5-10% mice were cardiac bled with 300 U/ml heparin to prevent clotting. The blood was then mixed with an equal volume of P. berghei freezing medium containing 20% DMSO, aliquoted into vials which were subsequently snap-frozen in liquid phase liquid nitrogen (LN2). Stocks were stored in vapour phase LN2.",

Mice were monitored from four or five days post-injection, dependent on mouse and parasite strain, via thin blood films. Once parasite positive blood films had been confirmed on three consecutive days, mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation. The parasitaemia levels from three blood smears also allowed the calculation of the time to 0.5 or 1% parasitaemia via linear regression, dependent on the spread of data collected. If thin blood films were negative fourteen days post-infection mice were classed as \u2018protected\u2019 and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.",

When the transgenic parasites contained the luciferase reporter gene, mice were imaged 44 hours post-infection to assay the level of liver-stage burden via bioluminescence of the parasites. Mice were firstly shaved over the area of the liver, then anaesthetised (3.5% isoflurane, 2 L/minute oxygen) and injected with 50 \u03bcl 50mg/ml D-luciferin substrate s.c. into the scruff of the neck. Eight minutes after the injection of luciferin, mice were imaged for two minutes with the following settings: binning medium, F/stop 1, excitation filter blocked and emission filter open. Quantification of the bioluminescence signal was performed using the Living Image 4.2 image analysis software program. A region of interest was created around the area of the liver and kept constant for all animals. The measurements were expressed as the total flux of photons emitted per second of exposure time.",

Sporozoites were counted and diluted to 2\u00d7105 sporozoites/ml with 100 \u03bcl added to each well in an 8-well microscope slide. Slides were then air dried, wrapped in foil and stored in a sealed bag with desiccant at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further use. For the IFAT, all steps were performed in the dark at room temperature. Wells were initially blocked for two hours with 1% BSA in PBS/T, washed three times with PBS then serum samples were added at a dilution of 1/100 in PBS. Slides and sera were incubated together for one hour, washed three times followed by the addition of 1/200 Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in 1% BSA PBS/T.

Experimental wells were performed in duplicate, or triplicate where possible. When splenocytes were added, mice were sacrificed and spleens harvested. Enrichment of CD8+ cells was performed. To inhibit the action of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity, enriched CD8+ splenocytes were pre-incubated with 10 nM concanamycin A for twenty minutes at 37\u00b0 C. To inhibit the action of cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1, enriched CD8+ splenocytes were resuspended in medium containing blocking antibodies at various concentrations.

                        "2.1 Introduction",
                        "Eight new pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines were developed based on eight candidate liver-stage antigens. The aim was to comparatively screen both immunogenicity and efficacy of these vaccines in mice.",
                        "The liver-stage of malaria is known to be the target of CD8+ T cells, possibly through IFN\u03b3. For this reason, the ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISpot has been used as the assay of choice to measure cellular immunogenicity in vaccine trials. However, most vaccine trials have failed to identify consistent correlates of protection [1, 4, 12, 29-31]. A multitude of factors could be involved and analysed, including alternative cytokine responses other than IFN\u03b3, memory responses, chemokines and chemokine receptors as well as T cell trafficking to various organs. Assessing all such factors at once in vitro would require an immense amount of reagents and time, but multi-parameter flow cytometry offers the opportunity to look at multiple cytokines and markers from both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. For the pre-erythrocytic antigen screen undertaken in this section, in addition to IFN\u03b3, the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-2 were also assessed as well as the degranulation marker CD107a; this constitutes the standard panel of markers recommended for assessment [32]. CD107a-expressing CD8\u2212 T cells represent cells capable of cytotoxic killing in an antigen-specific manner [37], which may have a role in protection against liver-stage malaria. As the majority of the candidate antigens are also expressed at either the sporozoite or blood-stage (apart from PfLSA1 and PfLSAP1), and these stages are known targets of antibody-mediated immunity [30, 38], relative antibody levels were also assessed.",
                        "Whilst it is important to determine that vaccines induce an immune response, the measures listed above do not necessarily indicate functional immunogenicity. That is, whether the T cells (or antibodies) that are induced by vaccination have the capability of inhibiting liver-stage malaria parasites (or other forms). It has historically been extremely difficult to assess functionality of immune responses directed at the P. falciparum liver-stage, for a number of reasons. First, P. falciparum cannot infect commonly used small animal models such as mice, and whilst non-human primates including Aotus monkeys can be infected with human malaria parasites they are not widely available and cost is a limiting factor. Species of malaria that infect rodents are commonly used to study the liver-stage of infection, such as P. berghei and P. yoelii, yet it is not clear how well studies using these models reflect P. falciparum infections in humans. Furthermore, many of the newly identified P. falciparum antigens do not have known rodent malaria homologs, making such studies currently impossible for those antigens. Second, unlike blood-stage vaccines where functional antibody responses can be tested in vitro using the growth inhibition assay, no such assay currently exists for the liver-stage of malaria.",
                        "A new model that has been increasingly used is the generation of transgenic P. berghei parasites that express a particular P. falciparum (or P. vivax) gene. Two methods have commonly been used, either replacement of the endogenous P. berghei gene with the P. falciparum homolog under control of the relevant P. berghei promoter, or addition of the P. falciparum copy of the gene inserted at a different and dispensable point in the genome. Such transgenic parasites allow assessment of efficacy of P. falciparum or P. vivax sub-unit vaccines in mice, using P. berghei expressing the appropriate human malaria antigen as the challenge agent. This strategy was used to develop ten transgenic P. berghei parasites expressing each of the eight candidate antigens studied in this study, together with CSP and TRAP as controls. The addition strategy was employed; the P. falciparum antigens were placed under control of the P. berghei UIS4 promoter, given not all the candidates have P. berghei homologs, and inserted at the P. berghei 230p locus. P. berghei UIS4 is expressed at both the sporozoite and liver-stage, and hence antigens placed under control of this promoter will also be expressed at these stages regardless of their native expression profile. This allows the immune response to each antigen to be comparatively screened, given all the targets will have the same expression level and profile. For antigens with known P. berghei homologs, PfCe1TOS, PFI0580c and PfUIS3, efficacy was initially assessed with a P. berghei wild-type challenge.",

                        "2.2.1 All Vaccines Elicit a Cellular Immune Response as Measured by ex vivo IFN\u03b3 ELISpot",
                        "The viral vectored vaccines were assessed for their relative levels of cellular immunogenicity by ex vivo spleen IFN\u03b3 ELISpot. The vaccines were delivered in an eight-week interval ChAd63 prime MVA boost regimen, and the cellular immune response was measured at two weeks post-boost and compared to data collected at two weeks post-prime section 2 (representing peak time-points post immunization [47, 48]). Immunogenicity was measured in two different strains of mice with different immune profiles: Balb/c, which preferentially produce Th2 cytokines, and C57BL/6, which preferentially produce Th1 cytokines [49-52]. Each vaccine induced a measurable immune response in Balb/c mice (FIG. 2). The MVA boost was able to return the IFN\u03b3 response to at least the level seen after the priming vaccination. For both PfUIS3 and PfLSA1, the boost vaccination significantly increased the IFN\u03b3 response above that observed two weeks after the prime, p<0.0001. The antigens are listed on the x-axis in increasing size order, and as can be seen, there was no clear trend between antigen size and the magnitude of the IFN\u03b3 response.",
                        "In C57BL/6 mice, no detectable response was observed after vaccination with either PfLSAP1 or PfLSA1. MVA-PFE1590w was unable to boost the IFN\u03b3 response to the level observed two weeks after the prime. For the remaining antigens, the MVA vaccination was able to boost the response to at least the level observed two weeks after the prime, with PfCe1TOS, PfUIS3 and PfLSA3 showing an increase in the median response post-boost compared to post-prime. The overall magnitude of the IFN\u03b3 responses was greater in C57BL6 as compared to Balb/c (FIG. 2A compared to B), as was the variation between mice. As all vaccines induced a cellular response in Balb/c mice, this strain was chosen to compare the efficacy of the eight vaccines against malaria challenge.",
                        "2.2.2 The Cellular Response to the Eight P. falciparum Vaccines is Predominantly CD8+ T Cell-Mediated",
                        "ICS was performed to determine whether the response was mediated predominantly by CD8+ or CD4+ T cells and whether other cytokines were also secreted in response to ex vivo antigen stimulation. Two time points were assessed in the blood, corresponding to the peak of the response after adenovirus (two weeks post-prime) or MVA vaccination (one week post-boost), in addition to two weeks post-boost in the spleen. In addition to IFN\u03b3, cells were stained for production of TNF_60  and IL-2, and the cell surface localisation of the degranulation marker CD107a. The responses two-weeks post-prime were just above the limit of detection and as such the data is not shown. For all vaccines in both the blood and the spleen post-boost, in both strains of mice, it was found that the response was predominantly CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1 or expressing CD107a, with minimal levels of IL-2-secretion, as detailed below.",
                        "In Balb/c mice, the cytokine profiles were quite different in the blood compared to the spleen. In the blood the greatest CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ responses were to antigens PfLSA1, PfLSA3 and PfUIS3 (medians of 4.2%, 4.8% and 6.3% respectively) (FIG. 3). PfLSA1 and PfLSA3 also showed the highest CD8+ TNF\u03b1+ responses (medians of 7.3% and 6.4% respectively) and CD8+ CD107a+ responses (medians of 17.1% and 12.1% respectively). The CD4+ responses were much lower than the CD8+ responses for all antigens, at less than 1% for each cytokine. In summary, in Balb/c mice in the blood one week post-boost, the response was predominantly CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 or expressing CD107a with the highest magnitude for PfLSA1 and PfLSA3.",
                        "In the spleen, the highest cytokine responses were observed for the antigens PfUIS3 and PfLSA1 (FIG. 4). This was the case for CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ (14% and 5.8% respectively), CD8+ TNF\u03b1+ (11.4% and 5.3% respectively) and CD8+ CD107a+ (13.9% and 6.6%). The CD4+ response was slightly higher than that seen one-week earlier in the blood, with the majority of responses less than 2%. The highest CD4\u2212 response was CD4+ IF\u03b3+ cells with a median of 1.4% for PfLSA3. There was also some detectable CD4+ IL-2+, approximately 0.5% for most antigens, with the response trending towards being dependent on antigen size (antigens are listed in order of increasing size on the x-axis). In summary, in Balb/c mice in the spleen two weeks post-boost, the response was predominantly CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 or expressing CD107a with the highest magnitude for PfUIS3 and PfLSA1 in each case. Considering both the responses in the blood and the spleen, the antigens PfUIS3, PfLSA1 and PfLSA3 were the most immunogenic in Balb/c mice.",
                        "In C57BL/6 mice, the cytokine profile was similar between the blood and spleen post-boost, and hence results are shown for the spleen only. The cytokine staining confirmed the results obtained by ELISpot that there were no T cell epitopes for the antigens PfLSAP1 and PfLSA1 in C57BL/6 mice (FIG. 5). Compared to Balb/c mice, the median responses were generally higher in C57BL/6 mice and a greater number of antigens had strong responses, consistent with data obtained by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot. PfUIS3, PfLSA3, PfCe1TOS and PFI0580c demonstrated the highest CD8+ response measured by IFN\u03b3+, TN\u03b1+ or CD107a+. The IL-2+ responses for both CD8+ and CD4+ were low, as were the CD4+ responses in general (less than 2%), but in each case the pattern of antigens responding with the highest magnitude was essentially the same. In summary, for C57BL/6 mice in both the blood and the spleen, the response was predominantly CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 or expressing CD107a with the highest magnitude for the antigens PfUIS3, PfLSA1, PfLSA3 and PFI0580c.",
                        "2.2.3 Vaccination with the Pre-Erythrocytic Candidate Antigens Can Also Induce an Antibody Response",
                        "Given most antigens are expressed at either the sporozoite or the blood stage, it is plausible that vaccination with these antigens could provide some degree of protective efficacy through an antibody-mediated effect. Therefore antibody levels in serum samples were measured using the LIPS assay. In brief, this system allows the measurement of antibody when protein samples are not available to perform standard ELISAs. Instead, genetic constructs are designed that fuse the antigen of interest to the Renilla luciferase reporter gene. The expressed construct can then be used to measure antibody in the LIPS assay, with luminescence (light units) as the read-out. Constructs were designed, cloned and transfected for each of the eight candidate antigens.",
                        "Antibody levels were assessed at both five to six weights post-prime (D35-42) and two weeks post-boost (D70). In Balb/c mice, only vaccination with the antigens PfUIS3, PfLSAP2 and PfI0580c generated a detectable antibody response after the ChAd63 prime vaccination (FIG. 6). No antibody responses above background levels were detected against PfLSAP1 at any time-point measured. All other vaccines generated a detectable antibody response after the MVA boost; this represented a small increase from the antibody level at D35-42 for PfLSA3 (p=0.028) and a significant increase for all other antigens (p=0.01-0.001).",
                        "The pattern of antibody responses observed in C57BL/6 was different to that observed in Balb/c mice. No antibody responses were detected at any time-point for PfLSAP1, PFE1590w, PfLSAP2 and PfLSA1 (FIG. 7). After the prime vaccination, antibody responses were only detected to PFI0580c. However after the boost vaccination, antibody responses were detectable against PfCe1TOS, PfUIS3 and PfLSA3, in addition to PFI0580c. This represented a significant increase from the antibody levels at D42 for both PfUIS3 (p=0.0112) and PfLSA3 (p=0.0286). Whilst there was a trend towards an increase at D70 for PfCe1TOS and PFI0580c, this was not significant. Interestingly, PFI0580c generated one of the highest relative antibody levels in C57BL/6 mice; this level was reached by D42 and did not increase significantly after the MVA boost.",
                        "As each antigen measured in the LIPS assay generated a different background response, analysis was then performed to measure the fold change from the na\u00efve (background) antibody level to the level reached after the boost vaccination (D70). This enabled the antigens to be compared side-by-side (FIG. 8). In Balb/c mice, vaccination with PFI0580c and PfLSAP2 generated the highest levels of antibodies (fold change of 1.6 and 1.5 respectively). The remaining antigens were all comparable, with a fold change from background of 1.3 (excluding PfLSAP1). In C57BL/6 mice, vaccination with PFI0580c resulted in the highest level of antibody production, with a fold change from background of 1.5. The next highest levels were seen for PfLSA3 (1.3), PfCe1TOS and PfUIS3 (both 1.2). In summary, vaccination with PFI0580c generated the highest antibody response in both strains of mice, with the relative antibody levels comparable between C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice.",

                        "After measuring the relative immunogenicity elicited by each candidate antigen in a prime-boost vaccination regimen, the ability of these vaccines to protect against malaria was then assessed. Since P. falciparum does not infect mice, other challenge models were investigated. According to PlasmoDB, P. berghei homologs only exist for the P. falciparum candidate antigens PfCe1TOS, PFI0580c and PfUIS3. A relatively high sequence similarity exists between the",

For this reason, it was assumed that if any epitopes fell in the regions of similarity it may be possible to see cross species protection after vaccination with the P. falciparum antigen and challenge with P. berghei sporozoites.",
                        "Protective efficacy of ChAd63-MVA PfCe1TOS vaccination was assessed in both Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice, given previous studies had demonstrated cross-species protection with PfCe1TOS protein vaccination [55, 56]. Mice were vaccinated with the standard eight-week prime boost regimen, with blood collected six days after MVA boost to assess cellular immunogenicity via ICS prior to challenge two days later (eight days post-boost) with 1000 P. berghei wild-type sporozoites injected intravenously. Despite a good cellular immune response observed in C57BL/6 mice (median 8.8% CD8+ cells secreting IFN\u03b3), vaccination with ChAd63-MVA PfCe1TOS failed to protect against challenge with P. berghei sporozoites. Antibodies were not measured in this experiment, but previous data indicated that post-boost PfCe1TOS vaccination results in a comparatively strong antigen-specific antibody response in C57BL/6 mice (FIG. 7). Given PfCe1TOS vaccination in Balb/c mice resulted in low level cellular immunogenicity in the blood as measured by ICS (negligible cytokine secretion, median 5.9% CD8+ cells expressing CD107a), it was not surprising that such vaccination did not result in any protective efficacy against P. berghei challenge. Antibodies were not assessed in this experiment but previous data indicated there was little to no antigen-specific antibody production after PfCe1TOS vaccination in Balb/c mice. This experiment was repeated (in Balb/c mice only) and the same result was found.",
                        "Protective efficacy against heterologous P. berghei challenge was assessed for PFI0580c vaccination in Balb/c mice, again following the standard eight-week interval prime-boost regimen. Cellular immunogenicity was assessed in the blood six days post MVA boost by ICS, and was very low (less than 0.5% for each cytokine from CD8+ T cells). As for PfCe1TOS, data is only shown for CD8+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1, or expressing the degranulation marker CD107a. Antibodies were not measured in this experiment but previous data indicated that PFI0580c vaccination in Balb/c mice resulted in high levels of antigen-specific antibodies, greater than vaccination with any other antigen. However, no protection was seen upon challenge with 1000 P. berghei sporozoites eight days post MVA boost.",
                        "Protective efficacy against heterologous P. berghei challenge was assessed for PfUIS3 vaccination in Balb/c mice. ICS analysis demonstrated a moderate immune response, with medians of 1.9% IFN\u03b3+, 3% TNF\u03b1+ and 4.8% CD107a+ from CD8+ T cells (FIG. 9A). This was comparable to the results previously found in the blood post MVA boost for PfUIS3 vaccination in Balb/c mice (FIG. 3), although the median CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ response was slightly lower. Data is not shown for CD4+ T cells or IL-2+ due to low-level responses, and again antibodies were not measured in this experiment but previous data showed positive antigen-specific antibody responses to PfUIS3 in Balb/c mice, with relatively high levels compared to those induced by the other antigens (FIG. 8). Upon i.v. challenge with 1000 P. berghei sporozoites eight days post MVA boost, there was a significant delay in the time taken for parasitaemia in the blood to reach 1% in vaccinated mice compared to controls, p=0.0048 Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test (FIG. 9 B). The delay in time to 1% parasitaemia was calculated by linear regression of the parasitaemia collected over three consecutive days. No mice were sterilely protected.",
                        "In summary, protective efficacy against heterologous P. berghei wild-type challenge was assessed after vaccination with the P. falciparum antigens for which there are P. berghei homologs, PfCe1TOS, PFI0580c and PfUIS3. These P. falciparum antigens have relatively high protein sequence similarity with their P. berghei homologs, of over 50%. Protective efficacy was assessed for each antigen in Balb/c mice, and additionally in C57BL/6 mice for PfCe1TOS. No protection was seen after ChAd63-MVA vaccination with PfCe1TOS or PFI0580c. There was a significant delay in time to 1% parasitaemia after vaccination with ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3 and challenge with P. berghei sporozoites.",

                        "Since P. falciparum does not infect mice, an alternative challenge model was required to assess the efficacy of the new viral vectored vaccines. As only three antigens contained P. berghei homologs, transgenic P. berghei parasites were developed that expressed the relevant P. falciparum antigen (in addition to the P. berghei copy of that antigen, if it existed). Each P. falciparum antigen was expressed under control of the P. berghei UIS4 promoter using the additional strategy (insertion at the 230p locus). To allow in vivo assessment of liver-stage infection, each transgenic parasite also contained the luciferase gene.",
                        "As fitness assessments of these transgenic parasites had not been undertaken, a standard challenge dose of 1000 sporozoites per mouse injected i.v. was used with all experiments. Experiments were performed in Balb/c mice to allow comparison between antigens (as not all vaccines were immunogenic in C57BL/6 mice). Furthermore, C57BL/6 mice succumb more quickly to P. berghei infection than Balb/c mice [57, 58]; using Balb/c mice therefore allowed greater discrimination of small differences of protectiveness between candidate antigens. Mice were vaccinated in the standard eight-week interval prime-boost regimen, with blood collected six days post MVA boost to check immunogenicity before proceeding with the challenge. This data is not shown but was comparable to that seen in the immunogenicity studies. For each transgenic parasite line, vaccinated mice were challenged eight days post MVA boost together with eight unvaccinated controls. The prime-boost regimen was varied slightly for PFI0580c, PFE1590w and PfLSAP2; due to failed sporozoite production mice were given a second MVA boost four weeks after the original boost, and challenged eight days after the second boost. Each transgenic parasite line resulted in different blood parasitaemia kinetics, and hence each vaccination-challenge experiment is presented on a separate survival graph (FIG. 10). No protection was conferred by vaccination with PfLSAP1, PFE1590w, PfCe1TOS and PfLSA3, with PfCe1TOS vaccination resulting in a significantly shorter time to 1% parasitaemia than seen in the control mice (p=0.0291, Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test), suggesting a negative effect of the vaccination. The transgenic parasite P. berghei PfLSA3 did not efficiently infect all eight na\u00efve controls; three mice showed no signs of parasites in the blood at fourteen days post challenge.",
                        "Four vaccination regimens resulted in a significant level of protection when comparing vaccinated mice with controls by the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test: PFI0580c (p=0.0072), PfUIS3 (p=0.0001), PfLSAP2 and PfLSA1 (both p<0.0001), as a result of sterile protection or a delay in time to 1% parasitaemia (FIG. 10). Mice were classified as sterilely protected when there was no evidence of parasites in the blood up to and including the experiment end-point, fourteen days post-challenge. PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 conferred sterile protection in seven out of eight vaccinated mice (87.5%) (Table 2.1), whilst only one PfUIS3 vaccinated mouse was sterilely protected (12.5%). The identical vaccination-challenge experiments were also performed for the antigens CSP and TRAP (survival curves not shown), with CSP resulting in 25% sterile protection and TRAP resulting in no sterile protection (Table 2.1).",
                        "In order to compare the delay in time to 1% parasitaemia (tt1%) across vaccines and transgenic parasite strains, the median delay was calculated by the following formula: (tt1% of vaccinee)\u2212(average tt1% of controls). This then accounts for the various fitness levels of the transgenic parasites (the differing blood parasitaemia kinetics). Mice that were sterilely protected, or not infected, were not included in this analysis. Vaccination with PfCSP or PfUIS3 resulted in a significant delay in time to 1% parasitaemia (p=0.004), as did PFI0580c (p=0.0072), whilst no delay was observed after vaccination with PfTRAP, PfLSAP1, PFE1590w, PfCe1TOS and PfLSA3 (FIG. 11). Vaccines are listed in increasing size order on the x-axis, after the control vaccines CSP and TRAP. Only one PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 vaccinated mouse became parasitaemic, so whilst statistical analysis cannot be performed, FIG. 11 indicates that those mice did have a greater median delay than the na\u00efve controls or mice vaccinated with antigens that resulted in no protection.",
                        "A summary of immunogenicity and efficacy for each candidate antigen is provided in Table 2.2. The level of cellular (ELISpot and ICS) or humoral (LIPS) immunogenicity of the candidate antigens did not necessarily predict a delay in parasitaemia or sterile protection. PfLSAP1 resulted in low levels of cellular immunogenicity (+) and no humoral immunogenicity (\u2212), and therefore the absence of any protective efficacy was not surprising. However, PFE1590w and PfCe1TOS both resulted in moderate levels (++) of cellular immunogenicity, yet no protection was seen. PfLSA3 resulted in high levels of cellular immunogenicity (+++) and reasonable levels of humoral immunogenicity (++) and still no protection was observed. Of the antigens that did provide protection, PfUIS3 and PFI0580c exhibited reasonable to high levels of both cellular and humoral immunogenicity and resulted in a delay in time to 1% parasitaemia, yet the immune responses to these antigens were comparable to the levels of both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 vaccination, which resulted in sterile protection. In each transgenic challenge experiment mice were assessed for liver-stage parasite burden at 44 hours post challenge by in vivo imaging (as the parasites expressed luciferase). For all vaccines that provided protection as determined by blood parasitaemia, protection was also evident by in vivo imaging of luciferase.",
                        "2.3 Discussion",
                        "This confirmed that all the viral vectored vaccines were expressing their target antigens, and induced high levels of IFN\u03b3 in a prime-boost regimen as measured by spleen ELISpot. The responses induced were of greater magnitude than immunization with the target antigens in different vaccine platforms, confirming that viral vectors are excellent inducers of cellular immunogenicity. Approximately twice the response was observed after ChAd63-MVA vaccination than previously observed by vaccination with either PfCe1TOS protein [55], PfLSA1 protein [59] or PfLSA3 DNA [60]. The only regimen with comparable immunogenicity was a recent paper using PfLSA1 and PfCe1TOS DNA vaccination (3\u00d730 \u03bcg) with in vivo electroporation [61]. Surprisingly, the boosting effect of the MVA only returned the IFN\u03b3 level measured by ELISpot to that seen after the prime, for most antigens. However, a clear difference was seen by ICS, as no detectable responses were measured post-prime but were measurable post-boost. As this study encompassed the greatest number of pre-erythrocytic antigens so far tested in the ChAd63-MVA prime-boost regimen, the ELISpot results may reflect variability or different kinetics leading to the peak time-point in the spleen being missed. Overall, PfUIS3, PfLSA1, PfCe1TOS and PfLSA3 vaccination, dependent on mouse strain, induced the greatest IFN\u03b3 responses.",
                        "The IFN\u03b3 response measured was induced predominantly through CD8+ T cells, with minimal CD4+ responses, confirming that viral vectors are excellent at inducing CD8+ T cells. Most cells also produced TNFa\u03b1 and expressed CD107a, suggesting the cells were capable of cytotoxic activity. As the spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ and immune cells travel through the blood to perform their effector functions, initial vaccine induced responses were assessed in these organs. For vaccines targeting liver-stage malaria, the effector immune cells must home to the liver in order to kill the intrahepatic parasites, therefore it is of interest to determine whether T cells induced by these viral vectored vaccines home to the liver. Since CD8+ T cells induced by the candidate vaccines produced multiple cytokines, it will also be important to determine whether polyfunctional cells contribute to a protective immune response. For the vaccines that induced the highest levels of protective immunity, PfUIS3, PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2, both the polyfunctionality and the ability to home to the liver was assessed in experiments described below.",
                        "All vaccines (except PfLSAP1) induced detectable antibody responses post-boost. The highest relative responses were to PFI0580c and PfLSAP2, both antigens that are either expressed at the sporozoite or blood-stage in addition to the liver-stage. Such a finding confirms previous results that the viral vectored platform can induce high antibody titres in addition to cellular responses.",
                        "Overall, cellular immune responses were greater in C57BL/6 mice than Balb/c mice, whilst humoral responses were comparable in both strains. This may be due to the greater innate capacity of the C57BL/6 strain to produce IFN\u03b3 compared to Balb/c [49-51]. Interestingly, despite the overall cellular immunity observed in C57BL/6 mice, not all antigens were capable of inducing a response (PfLSAP1 and PfLSA1), demonstrating the limited MHC repertoire of outbred mice. To overcome this limitation, multiple strains of mice can be used, or outbred mice. Outbred mice will exhibit greater variability, so are not ideal for initial screening studies, but are more representative of an outbred human population.",
                        "Surprisingly, ChAd63-MVA PfCe1TOS did not induce heterologous protection against P. berghei wild-type challenge in Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice, nor homologous protection against transgenic PbPfCe1TOS sporozoites. This was unexpected given adjuvanted PfCe1TOS protein has previously induced cross-species protection (60% sterile) in both Balb/c and outbred mice [55]. The protection observed was likely dependent on antibodies given the cellular response measured by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot was only a median of 100 SFC per million splenocytes, much lower than observed in this current study. However, a recent study by the same group utilizing bacteria as a vector demonstrated 60% homologous protection with PbCe1TOS and 55% heterologous protection with PfCe1TOS against P. berghei challenge [69]. This seems surprising given there was a negligible production of antibodies and less than 60 SFC per million splenocytes measured by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot. Furthermore, results from our laboratory identified no protection from ChAd63-MVA PbCe1TOS vaccination against homologous P. berghei challenge (Karolis Bauza, DPhil Thesis). One critical difference between the studies of Bergmann-Leitner and our laboratory was the route of sporozoite injection, with Bergmann-Leitner challenging by sub-cutaneous injection versus intravenous injection in this study. Intravenous injection is a more stringent challenge model [70], so perhaps efficacy would be observed in the ChAd63-MVA regimen if sub-cutaneous challenge was used. If the results from the planned PfCe1TOS clinical trial [5] prove successful and efficacy is associated with induced antibodies, a protein boost could be combined with the viral vectored approach to increase the antigen-specific antibody titre generated in this regimen [71, 72].",
                        "ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3 vaccination was able to induce protection against both homologous and heterologous challenge, seen as a delay in time to blood-stage parasitaemia. Whilst cross-species protection has been demonstrated in irradiated and genetically attenuated sporozoite models [73-75], this is only the second report utilizing a pre-erythrocytic sub-unit vaccine (the other being PfCe1TOS). The most significant finding was that both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 induced 87.5% sterile protection (7/8 mice). This was greater than the protective efficacy induced by ChAd63-MVA TRAP or CSP, and provides an excellent proof-of-concept that better target antigens do exist. PfLSAP2 was only recently identified as a liver-stage antigen [76], and these results mark the first studies of PfLSAP2 as a vaccine candidate. PfLSA1 was identified as a promising target in 1992 when an association was found with PfLSA1, HLA-B53 and resistance to severe malaria in Africa [77]. As there are no murine malaria homologs pre-clinical studies have been limited, yet PfLSA1 has consistently been associated with protection in studies of natural immunity and irradiated sporozoite immunization [78-81], and therefore clinical studies with this candidate should be considered.",
                        "Interestingly, vaccination with CSP provided a higher level of protection than with TRAP; this was not necessarily a surprising result, given a head to head comparison found PbCSP was more protective than PbTRAP [82], and in humans protective efficacy following ME-TRAP vaccination requires extremely high levels of T cells [4]. Nevertheless, at least a low level of protection might have been expected with TRAP and this finding highlights how little we truly understand about translating results from murine studies to the clinic. Of the other vaccines tested, PFI0580c also provided a delay in the time to blood-stage parasitaemia, albeit reduced compared to the delay induced by PfUIS3 or CSP. A combination vaccine of the P.yoelii version of PFI0580c and PyUIS3 has shown efficacy in outbred mice and hence the current finding suggests that both antigens should be further investigated. Neither PfLSAP1, PFE1590w nor PfLSA3 provided protection against transgenic challenge. This is the first time PfLSAP1 and PFE590w have been assessed as targets for a malaria vaccine, and hence there were no preconceived ideas on how these antigens may or may not perform. PfLSA3, however, has previously induced protection in mice [60], chimpanzees [83] and monkeys [84], yet the absence of reported data from a clinical trial due for completion in 2008 (ClinicalTrials.gov identified NCT00509158) suggests a lack of efficacy in humans.",
                        "Excitingly, both PfLSAP2 and PfLSA1 induced moderate cellular immune responses compared to the levels of CSP required to provide protection in murine models (Pb9 epitope, 20-30% antigen specific CD8+ cells) [85, 86], suggesting that such immunogenicity and efficacy could be attainable in a clinical setting. Interestingly, the magnitude of the immune response to the various candidate antigens did not predict which vaccines would be protective, as PfLSA3 vaccination induced strong immunogenicity and yet no efficacy was seen. This supports the notion that not only the magnitude, but also the quality of the immune response is important in eliciting protection. These findings also indicate that the antigenic target is of high importance, and suggests that both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 are potentially better targets than CSP or TRAP for a pre-erythrocytic vaccine. The efficacy seen by these vaccines needs to be confirmed and assessed in other strains of mice to ensure it is not H-2d restricted; further assessment of these candidate vaccines was performed and the results are described below.",
                        "In summary, these results demonstrated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the eight candidate antigens. All antigens were immunogenic when administered in the standard eight-week interval prime-boost regimen, producing predominantly CD8+ cells secreting IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 and expressing CD107a, with most vaccines also inducing detectable levels of antibodies. PfUIS3, PfLSA1, PfLSA3 and PfCe1TOS induced the highest cellular responses, whilst PfLSAP2 and PFI0580c induced the highest antibody responses. PfLSA1, PfLSAP2 and PfUIS3 were capable of inducing greater protective efficacy than demonstrated for PfCSP or TRAP, providing excellent proof-of-concept that better target antigens do exist, as has recently been shown for blood-stage vaccines [87]."

The vaccines encoding PfUIS3, PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 induced the greatest level of protection, equal to or greater than protection seen with the antigens PfTRAP and PfCSP, the two most advanced clinical vaccine antigens.",
                        "In the previous section, protection against sporozoite challenge was only assessed in Balb/c mice. The drawback of using inbred mice is that protection may be MHC restricted, and hence may not translate into efficacy in humans. Ideally, vaccines identified as protective in inbred strains should also be tested in outbred mice, where there is high genetic diversity and broad MHC expression, similar to human populations. Furthermore, immunogenicity of these candidate vaccines was only assessed in the blood and spleen, yet primed immune cells are most likely required to home to the liver to exert their effect, and the liver is also an immunological organ capable of presenting antigen to na\u00efve T cells [22].",
                        "The work described in this section aimed to further assess the protective efficacy induced by ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3, PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 vaccination. The first aim was to confirm protection in Balb/c mice and elucidate the mechanism of protection. The second aim was to assess efficacy in two further strains of mice, C57BL/6 (H-2b) and CD-1 outbred mice, to determine whether the protection was MHC restricted. The third aim was to further assess the immune response induced by these vaccines, by identifying the immunodominant epitopes in Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice and determining whether an antigen-specific response was detectable in the liver prior to challenge. A model was also available to assess the presence of HLA-A2 restricted epitopes within these antigens: transgenic mice expressing HLA-A2 [28]. HLA-A2 is a common MHC type in the general human population [29], and hence finding an HLA-A2 restricted epitope would suggest there is potential for the efficacy of these vaccines in mice to translate into humans. A probable clinical vaccination regimen using these antigens would be a multi-component malaria vaccine; therefore, the final aim of this section was the assessment of antigen interference or competition if these vaccines were used in combination with each other, or with the leading viral vectored vaccine ME-TRAP.",

                        "To confirm PfUIS3 vaccination results in protection in Balb/c mice, two further independent challenges were performed using P. berghei transgenic parasites expressing P. falciparum UIS3 (PbPfUIS3). In both repeat challenges, a significant difference was confirmed between vaccinated and na\u00efve control mice (p=0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively, Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test) (FIG. 12 A and B). The protection largely presented as a delay in time to 1% parasitaemia, with a median of 7.3 days in vaccinated mice compared to 5.5 days in control mice in the first experiment (p=0.0011), and 6.8 compared to 5.1 days in the second (p=0.0001). Two out of seven mice (26%) were also sterilely protected in the first experiment, and one out of eight (12.5%) in the second. Mice were considered sterilely protected if they were slide-negative at fourteen days post-challenge.

PfLSAP2 vaccination did not provide protection in C57BL/6 mice, but efficacy is still to be assessed in CD-1 outbred mice. PfLSA1 was identified as a promising candidate due to protection in outbred mice, given these mice are more representative of an outbred human population.

The effect of PfUIS3 and PfLSAP2 combination vaccination was also assessed. C57BL/6 mice were chosen as the ME string contains the strong P. berghei Pb9 H-2d-restricted epitope from CSP [34], and hence immunogenicity measured in Balb/c mice would reflect the effect of competition on P. berghei CSP rather than P. falciparum TRAP.

PfUIS3 vaccination was able to induce similar levels of efficacy in two inbred strains of mice, most likely through the action of CD8+ T cells on liver-stage parasites. There was a trend towards protection in outbred mice, which may be achievable if the percentage of antigen-specific cells is increased. PfUIS3 is located in the PVM, providing support that this protein could be exported into the hepatocyte cytoplasm and presented on the cell surface. These are the first results showing the promise of PfUIS3 alone, not just in combination. Whilst PfLSAP2 induced a high degree of sterile protection in Balb/c mice, this is likely either H-2d-restricted or antibody-mediated. These results represent the first assessment of PfLSAP2 as a vaccine candidate, and warrant further investigation. PfLSA1 was identified as the strongest candidate, with almost complete sterile protection in outbred mice. PfLSA1 is indispensible for liver-stage infection, has consistently been associated with protection in natural immunity and these results strongly suggest it is presented on the hepatocyte cell-surface as a target of CD8+ T cells. These results also highlight the value of transgenic parasites, as both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 contain no murine homologs and hence efficacy has not previously been possible to assess in mice."

The sporozoite microneme protein essential for cell traversal, SPECT-1, is considered a potential pre-erythrocytic immune target due to the key role it plays in crossing of the malaria parasite across the dermis and the liver sinusoidal wall, prior to invasion of hepatocytes [16, 21] but they have not previously been shown to provide any protective efficacy as vaccine candidates. Several sporozoite proteins have been implicated in crossing the dermal cell barrier and subsequent migration to liver sinusoid [22],[23],[24], [25]."

Vaccine sequence was modified for mammalian codon optimization prior to cloning into the ChAd63 and MVA vectors. The size and the sequence details of PfSPECT-1 antigen are listed below.

The P. falciparum gene coding sequence was placed under control of the regulatory regions (the promoter and transcriptional terminator sequences) of the P. berghei UIS4 gene. The UIS4 gene is specifically expressed at the Plasmodium sporozoite and liver-stages [28, 29]. Genotype analyses of the cloned PfSPECT-1Pbuis4 (2414 cl1) chimeric line generated confirmed correct integration of the PfSPECT-1 coding sequence into the P. berghei genome. Phenotype analysis of the chimeric parasites, using an immunofluorescence assay, confirmed the expression of the P. falciparum candidates in the chimeric sporozoites (FIG. 31A). Chimeric parasite fitness and liver loads in na\u00efve mice were assessed by their challenged with transgenic chimeric sporozoites were quantified by measuring luminescence levels of the Luciferase activity at 44 hours after infection using the IVIS 200 system (FIG. 31B).",

Mice were vaccinated i.m. with 1\u00d7108 ifu ChAd63-PfLSPECT-1 followed eight weeks later by 1\u00d7107 pfu MVA-PfLSPECT-1. Mice were challenged i.v. with 1000 transgenic PfLSPECT-1Pbuis4 (2414 cl1) sporozoites ten days post-MVA boost, along with naive control mice. Mice were monitored daily to enable calculation of the time to 1% parasitaemia. Mice that were slide-negative at fourteen days post-challenge were considered sterilely protected. The Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to assess differences between the survival curves. PfSPECT-1 vaccination resulted in a good sterile protection level and significant delay to 1% parasitaemia. In Balb/c inbred mice (vaccinated n=8, naive n=8); PfSPECT-1 induced 37.5% sterile protection with a significant delay to 1% parasitaemia p=0.0008. While, in CD-1 outbred mice (vaccinated n=10, naive n=10), PfSPECT-1 induced 70% sterile protectTion with a significant delay to 1% parasitaemia p=0.0023 (FIG. 32). PfSPECT-1 induced higher protection level in this challenge model in comparison to our standard current leading P. falciparum malaria vaccine PfCSP which showed 31.25% and 33.3% sterile protection in Balb/c and CD-1 mice, respectively (FIG. 33).",

Specifically, 30,000 Huh-7 hepatocytes were seeded in 96 cell culture plate. After 12 hours; 15,000 PfSPECT-1 chimeric sporozoites were added per hepatocyte wells either mixed with sera from mice vaccinated against PfSPECT-1 or nave mice controls and incubated for 28-30 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 incubator. In this experiment; two different serum concentrations were used 10% and 2%. After the incubation, the hepatocytes from each well were trypsinized and the emitted GFP signal from each well was measured by using the LSRII machine. Serum from mice vaccinated with PfSPECT-1 showed high level of hepatocyte infection blocking; 95% and 93% invasion blocking using 10% serum from Balb/c and CD-1 mice, respectively, and 87% and 74% invasion blocking using 2% serum from Balb/c and CD-1 mice, respectively. Using serum from Balb/c mice vaccinated against PfCSP in the same showed 99% and 81% hepatocyte invasion blocking with 10% and 2% serum, respectively (FIG. 34).",

                        "These data provide compelling evidence that SPECT-1 is a very promising and surprising vaccine candidate for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria. The results are especially surprising given the prior evidence that CS protein is the most abundant protein on the sporozoite surface and a very well studied protective antigen. Here we show that SPECT-1 can produce a protective immune responses that in outbred CD-1 mice exceeds substantially the efficacy achieved by equivalent CS-based vaccines. Efficacy on outbred mice is considered a particularly good indicator of likely efficacy in humans because of the genetic diversity of outbred mice. These findings provide the exciting opportunity of a SPECT-1 based vaccine that could outperform CS-based candidate vaccines or could be used to enhance the immunogenicity of existing CS-based malaria vaccines. The sporozoite invasion inhibition data suggests strongly that, like with CS-based vaccines, the mechanism of efficacy involves antibodies that prevent sporozoites invading hepatocytes. In contrast evaluation of 10 other antigens in this work failed to find evidence that these antigens could induce antibodies that protected against malaria. Vaccines based on the finding here of high level efficacy using the SPECT-1 antigen could comprise viral vectored vaccines, as used here, protein- or virus-like particle-based vaccines, DNA-based vaccines or a variety of other vaccine types well known in the art."
