    "title": "Comparative assessment of vaccine vectors encoding ten malaria antigens identifies two protective liver-stage candidates",
    "date": "2015-07-03",
    "abstract": "The development of an efficacious Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine remains a top priority for global health. Vaccination with irradiated sporozoites is able to provide complete sterile protection through the action of CD8(+) T cells at the liver-stage of infection. However, this method is currently unsuitable for large-scale deployment and focus has instead turned to the development of sub-unit vaccines. Sub-unit vaccine efforts have traditionally focused on two well-known pre-erythrocytic antigens, CSP and TRAP, yet thousands of genes are expressed in the liver-stage. We sought to assess the ability of eight alternative P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens to induce a high proportion of CD8(+) T cells. We show that all antigens, when expressed individually in the non-replicating viral vectors ChAd63 and MVA, are capable of inducing an immune response in mice. Furthermore, we also developed chimeric P. berghei parasites expressing the cognate P. falciparum antigen to enable assessment of efficacy in mice. Our preliminary results indicate that vectors encoding either PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 are capable of inducing sterile protection dependent on the presence of CD8(+) T cells. This work has identified two promising P. falciparum liver-stage candidate antigens that will now undergo further testing in humans.",

                        "We first assessed whether the candidate vaccines could induce cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c mice using a heterologous ChAd63-MVA prime-boost intramuscular (i.m.) regimen with an eight-week interval (Fig. 1). Specifically, we assessed five previously tested antigens, PfLSA113, liver-stage antigen 3 (PfLSA3)14, cell traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (PfCelTOS)15, upregulated in sporozoite 3 (PfUIS3) and PfFalstatin16, as well as three more recently identified candidates liver-stage associated protein 1 (PfLSAP1), PfLSAP217 and the early transcribed membrane protein 5 (PfETRAMP5)18. Candidate antigens were chosen based on three criteria: evidence of being expressed at a high level at the liver-stage; of being targets of a T cell response in natural infection or during irradiated sporozoite immunization; and evidence of protection with vaccine constructs using a rodent parasite ortholog or with P. falciparum in non-human primates.",
                        "T cell responses to all antigens, predominantly CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ cells, were detected in the blood one week after MVA boost, with the highest frequencies observed after vaccination with PfLSA1, PfLSA3 and PfUIS3 (medians of 6.3%, 4.8% and 4.2% of CD8+ cells producing IFN\u03b3, respectively) (Fig. 1a). CD4+ IFN\u03b3+ cells were also detected, albeit at a frequency of less than 0.5% of total CD4+ cells for most antigens (Fig. 1b). A more sensitive method of detecting cellular responses, ex vivo IFN\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay, was also used to assess responses in the spleen post-ChAd63 and post-MVA (Fig. 1c). One week after MVA boost the highest immunogenicity levels observed were against the antigens PfUIS3 and PfLSA1 (medians of 1200 and 868 spot forming units (SFU) per million splenocytes, respectively). Induction of humoral immunity was assessed through the luminescence immunoprecipitation system (LIPS)19. Detectable antibodies, as determined by the fold change in comparison to na\u00efve mice, were observed against all antigens except PfLSAP1 (Fig. 1d). The greatest magnitude responses were observed for PfFalstatin and PfLSAP2, with a fold change of 1.6 and 1.5, respectively.",
                        "We also assessed whether the candidate vaccines were able to induce immune responses in C57BL/6 mice using the same heterologous ChAd63-MVA prime-boost eight-week interval regimen (Fig. 2). CD8+ IFN\u03b3+ T cell responses were detected in the blood one week after MVA boost to all antigens except PfLSAP1 and PfLSA1 (Fig. 2a). In general, responses were of higher frequency than seen in BALB/c mice, but with greater levels of variation. Responses of the highest frequency were observed after vaccination with PfUIS3 and PfLSA3 (medians of 13.7% and 12.8% of CD8+ producing IFN\u03b3+, respectively). As for BALB/c mice, CD4+ IFN\u03b3+ responses were detected but at a lower frequency (less than 0.8% of total CD4+ cells) (Fig. 2b). The splenic IFN\u03b3 ELISpot results confirmed an absence of detectable cellular immune responses to PfLSA1 and PfLSAP1 (Fig. 2c). No antibodies were detectable against PfLSAP1, PfLSAP2 and PfLSA1, with a borderline response to PfETRAMP5 (Fig. 2d). The greatest magnitude response was measured for PfFalstatin with a fold change of 1.5, similar to that observed in BALB/c mice."

                        "We next assessed the protective efficacy of these P. falciparum vaccines in inbred and outbred mice, through the use of chimeric P. berghei sporozoites expressing the cognate P. falciparum antigen. We tested the efficacy of our vaccines in BALB/c mice because a detectable cellular immune response was generated to all antigens and because these responses were more consistent than in C57BL/6 mice. We also conducted the same experiments in an outbred strain of mice, CD-1, in order to limit the effect of MHC restriction and immunodominance that can be observed in inbred strains of mice. Following an eight-week interval i.m. vaccination regimen, mice were challenged eight days after MVA boost, which corresponds to the approximate peak of CD8+ T cell immunogenicity20, with 1000 chimeric sporozoites injected intravenously (i.v.) to focus the challenge to a liver-stage infection. PfCSP and PfTRAP were used as control antigens. For all challenge experiments, statistically significant efficacy (sterile protection or delay) was assessed using the Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) Test.",
                        "Vaccination with PfTRAP did not induce a statistically significant level of sterile protection in the chimeric parasite model in BALB/c mice, but did protect 3/10 (30%) CD-1 mice (Table 1). Vaccination with PfCSP protected 3/8 BALB/c mice (37.5%) and 3/9 (33.3%) CD-1 mice. The remaining mice had a significant delay in the time to 1% parasitaemia, with a median delay of 1.47 (p\u2009=\u20090.0008) and 0.48 days (p\u2009=\u20090.001) in BALB/c and CD-1 mice respectively. In comparison, vaccination with PfLSA1 protected 7/8 (87.5%) of both BALB/c and CD-1 mice, a statistically significantly higher proportion than of unvaccinated mice (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Similarly, vaccination with PfLSAP2 protected 7/8 (87.5%) BALB/c mice and 7/10 (70%) CD-1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 and p\u2009=\u20090.0009, respectively).",

However, PfUIS3 vaccination was unable to confer protection in CD-1 mice despite a non-significant trend towards delayed parasitaemia (median delay of 1.10 days compared with na\u00efve controls). PfFalstatin was also able to induce a statistically significant but small delay in the time to 1% parasitaemia in both BALB/c and CD-1 mice (median delay of 0.59 days, p\u2009=\u20090.007, and 0.97 days, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, respectively). PfLSA3 was able to induce a statistically significant but small delay in the time to 1% parasitaemia in BALB/c mice (median 0.35 days, p\u2009=\u20090.03), but not in CD-1 mice. PfCelTOS, PfLSAP1 or PfETRAMP5 vaccination was unable to provide sterile protection or a delay in the time to 1% parasitaemia in BALB/c or CD-1 mice.

Whilst use of the i.v. route of challenge permitted focus on the liver-stage of infection, protection could still have been mediated via antibody inhibition of sporozoite invasion and/or cell-mediated killing of infected hepatocytes. We depleted BALB/c mice of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells before challenge to determine the reliance on T cells and the relative contribution of each sub-set to protection (Fig. 3), using PfLSAP2 and PfLSA1 as model antigens given their superior efficacy against chimeric parasites.",

CD8+ depletion reduced sterile protection from 6/8 (75%) in the IgG control group to 1/8 (12.5%) (p\u2009=\u20090.03) and there was no statistically significant difference between the CD8+ depleted group and na\u00efve mice. CD4+ T cells did not appear to play a protective role following vaccination with PfLSAP2, since no significant difference compared to the IgG control group was observed, with 5/8 (62.5%) mice remaining sterilely protected. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference between the CD4+ depleted group and na\u00efve mice (p\u2009=\u20090.01).",

CD8+ depletion reduced sterile protection from 4/7 (57.1%) in the IgG control group to 1/8 (12.5%), but did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.07). 2/8 (25%) mice were sterilely protected after CD4+ depletion, a statistically greater level than compared to the na\u00efve control group (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), suggesting these mice are still afforded with some protection.",

                "The pre-erythrocytic sub-unit vaccines currently undergoing clinical assessment are based on only two antigens, namely PfCSP and PfTRAP. Our results demonstrate that other antigen candidates are also capable of inducing strong CD8+ T cell responses and may be better targets for a liver-stage malaria vaccine. Our work highlights the capacity of viral vectored vaccines in general to induce strong cellular immunogenicity, and we consistently found that the antigens PfLSA1, PfLSA3 and PfUIS3 were capable of inducing responses of the highest magnitudes. Approximately twice the frequency of antigen-specific cells was observed after ChAd63-MVA vaccination than previously observed by vaccination with PfCelTOS protein15, PfLSA1 protein24 or PfLSA3 DNA14; only DNA vaccination with in vivo electroporation has been shown to be similarly immunogenic25. In the current study, responses predominantly comprised CD8+ T cells secreting IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 or with upregulated expression of the cytotoxic marker CD107a.",
                "We chose to use chimeric P. berghei parasites expressing the cognate P. falciparum antigen in order to assess efficacy in a murine model. We found that vaccines expressing either PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 were substantially and significantly more effective than both PfCSP and PfTRAP when delivered using the same ChAd63-MVA prime-boost regimen. Vaccination with PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 sterilely protected 87.5% of BALB/c mice, compared with 37.5% efficacy for PfCSP and 0% efficacy for PfTRAP. Vaccination with PfLSA1 or PfLSAP2 also provided greater than 70% sterile protection in outbred mice, a level of efficacy not previously achieved to our knowledge, and again, greater than that induced by PfCSP (33%) or PfTRAP (30%). Vaccination with PfUIS3, PfFalstatin and PfLSA3 in BALB/c mice provided a degree of protection, manifest largely as a delay in the time to patent parasitaemia, consistent with previous work using murine Plasmodium challenges1416. Protection was also induced at a low level for PfFalstatin in outbred mice. Surprisingly, no protection was observed after vaccination with PfCelTOS despite previous reports of cross-species protection in murine models15.",
                "Neither PfLSA1 nor PfLSAP2 have a known ortholog in a murine parasite species, and hence the classical method of pre-clinical testing using rodent parasite orthologs of P. falciparum antigens as vaccine candidates would not have been able to identify these as protective, highlighting the value of the chimeric parasite system described here. There are, however, a number of limitations with this model and hence we consider our results as preliminary. First, despite the use of chimeric parasites it is still a murine model and encounters issues of small numbers of MHC restricted epitopes and marked immunodominance, which is less prominent in human populations26. Outbred mice can be used to possibly reflect more accurately what may be seen in a human study and, importantly, efficacy with PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 was here maintained in CD-1 mice. However, it is possible that some of the candidate antigens that were poorly immunogenic and not protective in outbred mice may still be immunogenic in human populations. Second, the P. falciparum antigen is under control of the P. berghei UIS4 promoter. Whilst this places all antigens on an even level, in terms of expression, it will be important to compare efficacy when expression levels are matched as far as possible to those observed with the native P. falciparum parasite, perhaps using replacements of P. berghei genes with their P. falciparum orthologs. However, this approach is not applicable to the most protective antigens identified, which have no P. berghei orthologs. Despite these limitations, the identification of several antigens that could provide greater efficacy than PfCSP or PfTRAP indicates that further antigens warrant assessment in the same system. This study is also the first report of PfLSAP2 as an antigenic target in a malaria vaccine and hence the current findings should encourage further research into its functional role.",
                "The use of a murine model to assess efficacy also allowed us to determine the importance of the CD8+ T cells our vaccines induced. We utilized both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 as model antigens to further explore the mechanisms of protection given their superior efficacy against chimeric parasites. The depletion experiments highlighted a strong dependence on CD8+ T cells for protection after vaccination with both PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2. Both these antigens are likely located in the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM)1727, and antigens that reach the PVM or host cell cytoplasm may have epitopes that are better presented on the hepatocyte surface than non-PVM antigens2829. PfLSA1 and PfLSAP2 may in this way provide good targets for a cell-mediated immune response. It was also of interest to determine whether these vaccines induced an antigen-specific response in the liver, given that liver-resident CD8+ T cells would reduce the time taken to mount an effective immune response. Moreover, it is known that the liver is an immunological organ that is capable of presenting antigen to na\u00efve T cells30, and previous studies have demonstrated the presence of liver-resident T cells following vaccination with various malaria constructs2331323334. We similarly found evidence of antigen-specific CD8+ cells in the livers of vaccinated mice, largely of the effector memory sub-type with similar frequencies to previously reported results2335.",
                "Whilst our efficacy results are preliminary, this work provides strong support for the progression of ChAd63-MVA PfLSA1 to clinical assessment. The level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells induced in mice was of a moderate frequency, and similar levels should be achievable in humans with viral vectors, based on previous studies7. PfLSA1 is known to be well conserved amongst P. falciparum isolates3637 and cellular responses to PfLSA1 have been associated with protection in studies of naturally acquired immunity and in volunteers vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites38394041424344. Furthermore, PfLSA1 is essential for late liver-stage development45, likely involved in the transition from the liver-stage to the blood-stage, as it is expressed abundantly in the PV as flocculent material surrounding merozoites36. Whilst a clinical trial of recombinant protein PfLSA1 provided no protection against sporozoite challenge13, this was most likely due to the absence of induced CD8+ T cells. If the protective effects of ChAd63-MVA PfLSA1 are confirmed in efficacy trials in non-immune adults, this could pave the way for a new generation of malaria vaccines incorporating multiple protective antigens that may be identified using chimeric parasites."

This sequence was not added for PfLSA3, PfLSAP1 and PfUIS3 because these antigens contain two predicted transmembrane domains and so are likely to be anchored in the membrane, based on their predicted subcellular location and membrane topology.

Expression of the P. falciparum antigens in the chimeric parasites was analysed by immunofluorescence assay (see Supplementary Fig. S5). Chimeric sporozoites were loaded onto glass slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The slides were then blocked with 10% FCS and 1% BSA in PBS before the addition of either monoclonal antibodies to P. berghei CSP (3D11) or P. falciparum CSP (2A10) (MR4, USA), or serum from vaccinated mice. Bound IgG was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) and nuclear DNA stained with 2% Hoechst-33342. Slides were mounted with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Denmark) and viewed under a Leica DMI-300B microscope.",

All chimeric parasites were comparable to wild-type P. berghei in CD-1 mice, with two exceptions: the PfCSP and PfLSA3 chimerics were slightly less potent than wild-type infection (median time to 1% parasitaemia of 6.35 days in wild-type, compared to 6.77 days for the PfCSP chimeric and 6.96 days for PfLSA3) (p\u2009=\u20090.009 and p\u2009=\u20090.0004, respectively, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. S7)."

Mice were monitored from four days post-infection by thin film blood smears stained with Giemsa and assessed by light microscopy for the presence of blood-stage parasites. Once positive blood-films had been confirmed on three consecutive days, or mice had reached the end-point of fourteen days parasite free (sterilely protected), mice were culled. The time to 0.5 or 1% parasitaemia was subsequently calculated using linear regression based on the three consecutive thin blood films, dependent on the spread of data collected."
