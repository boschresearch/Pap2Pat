The technique may be implemented using a single actively controlled qubit [100], e.g., a quantum emitter, and a pair of delay line loops [106, 108], which can be physically realized using existing technologies in quantum photonic and phononic systems. A three-dimensional cluster state is prepared by using the actively con-trolled qubit to generate data qubits that propagate through the two delay line loops, interact with the actively controlled qubit, and then are measured by a detector [110].",

                        "In recent years, significant experimental progress has been made towards building a large-scale quantum computer. In platforms such as superconducting qubits and trapped ions, the error rates for small systems have been successfully suppressed below the threshold error rate of the surface code [1, 2, 3]. Using newly developed techniques for neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, the coherence time, gate fidelity, and read-out fidelity for large assemblies of qubits are being rapidly improved [4, 5, 6, 7]. These advances give us hope that we will one day be able to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation by scaling up these systems while maintaining low error rates.",
                        "However, the scalability of leading approaches remains an important challenge. Current estimates suggest that the engineering effort needed to build even a single logical qubit with logical error rate low enough for useful quantum computation could be enormous [8]. Quantum algorithms with practical ramifications can involve applying at least \u02dc10\u22128 logical gates to \u02dc100 logical qubits [9, 10]. To ensure that the outcome of the computation is correct with high probability, the logical error rate would then need to be below \u02dc10\u22128. Based on the sub-threshold error scaling in Ref. [11], this would require at least \u02dc400 physical qubits per logical qubit if the physical error rate is half the threshold.",
                        "Manufacturing, calibrating and controlling physical qubits in such large numbers will be tremendously difficult. The fabrication process for components of solid-state quantum devices, such as quantum dots or superconducting circuits [1], is inevitably imperfect, leading to variations in the properties of individual qubits and their interactions. Even in systems where qubits are encoded in identical particles, e.g., trapped ions [2, 3, 12] or neutral atoms [4, 5, 6, 7], experimental control parameters such as the strengths of laser excitation pulses or trapping potentials may exhibit inhomogeneity. Thus, in order to control these qubits with high fidelity, an experimental system needs to be accurately calibrated across the entire quantum computer. In superconducting circuits, for instance, inhomogeneity is unavoidable, and stray couplings between ideally independent qubits are an experimental fact of life that must be mitigated through control logic (see e.g., [1].) The difficulty of doing so increases significantly with the number of qubits [13]."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "To circumvent these challenges, we provide a novel approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, in which a well-protected logical qubit can be built using only a few physical components. Consequently, the engineering effort required to develop the computer's components is significantly reduced, providing a simpler and more easily scalable route to fault-tolerant quantum computation. At a high level, our approach succeeds by shedding the limitations implicit in two assumptions that usually guide fault-tolerant circuit design: first, that the computer's qubits are all of the same type so are fairly homogeneous, and second, that good fault-tolerant gates should not propagate errors.",
                        "Specifically, we provide a fault-tolerant protocol for generating the three-dimensional cluster state of Ref. [14], which can then be used to perform universal fault-tolerant computation via adaptive single-qubit measurements. While there is already a well-known procedure for preparing this state, our method has the advantage of being compatible with a much simpler physical realization than what was originally envisaged in Refs. [14, 15, 16]. We take an approach similar to existing proposals for building large one- and two-dimensional cluster states using a small number of physical components [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. However, while two-dimensional cluster states are universal for quantum computation, they are not known to support fault-tolerant quantum computation. More precisely, two-dimensional cluster states of unprotected physical qubits are not known to be a particularly useful resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Two-dimensional cluster states can be used to perform local gates on a one-dimensional array of qubits [22], for which fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes have been developed [23, 24]. However, the threshold (in the circuit model) is likely prohibitively low (estimated to be 10\u22125 [24]). The step from universality to fault-tolerance is not obvious and, in fact, quite surprising considering the architecture of the system.",
                        "Our protocol is built around a special ancilla qubit, , which interacts sequentially with a stream of data qubits propagating through a delay line. These data qubits are encoded in degrees of freedom sharing a common physical implementation, e.g., different temporal modes of photons or phonons in a waveguide. The only interactions are between  and data qubits (and not between data qubits themselves), and these interactions are fixed and periodic, requiring a modest amount of calibration. We show, moreover, that all of the operations required in our protocol can be implemented using existing technologies in quantum photonic and phononic systems.",
                        "To demonstrate fault-tolerance, we analyze the robustness of our protocol against both circuit errors and memory errors. We use a standard depolarizing model to describe circuit errors, which are associated with imperfect gates, measurements, and state initialization. Memory errors refer to errors that occur while qubits are idle, for which we study the effect of dephasing and qubit loss.",
                        "In the absence of memory errors, there is a threshold of 0.39% for the circuit error rate, below which the logical error can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing the number of physical qubits. In the presence of memory errors, the logical error rate cannot be arbitrarily suppressed. However, provided that the circuit error rate is below threshold, the logical error rate decays rapidly with the inverse of the memory error rate. More precisely, suppose that the coherence time of the data qubits is lower-bounded by T. Then for a sufficiently large but finite T, the logical error rate can be made exponentially small in . Here,  is the inverse of the frequency with which gates are applied, which is ultimately limited by the timescale for interactions between  and data qubits. The number of logical gates that can be reliably executed will therefore scale exponentially with .",
                        "A large separation between T and  is often observed in certain experimental platforms, such as trapped ions or neutral atoms utilizing atomic clock transitions [12, 4, 5, 6]. Indeed, because of the strict separation in the roles of  and the data qubits, maximizing the ratio T/ while maintaining high gate fidelity is an invitation to design a hybrid system having two types of qubits with different physical substrates. That is the context in which we expect our scheme to be the most promising. Photonic [25] and phononic [26] delay lines are known to be good quantum memories, and can be coupled to controllable qubits capable of playing the role of .",
                        "To illustrate the advantages of our scheme, suppose that memory errors are dominated by loss. Then, if the circuit error rate is 10\u22123 an aspirational but realistic target\u2014our protocol can in principle attain a logical error rate of 10\u22128 for /T\u22481.4\u00d710\u22125, and 10\u22125 for /T\u22483.2\u00d710\u22126. These estimates suggest that extremely low logical error rates can be achieved by improving a very small number of experimental components. In particular, if the operations involving  can be calibrated such that circuit error rate is below the threshold value of 0.39%, incremental improvements of a single component\u2014the delay line\u2014can lead to drastic reductions in the logical error rate.",
                        "Although our scheme was primarily motivated by the aforementioned experimental considerations, it also has a novel feature that is counterintuitive from the point of view of fault-tolerance. The design of fault-tolerant protocols usually aims to prevent the propagation of single-qubit errors to many qubits. This is achieved, naturally enough, by applying gates that do not spread errors, e.g., transversal gates, or \u201clong\u201d gates that are interspersed with error correction steps, such as in lattice surgery [27]. In all of these methods, one actively avoids interacting one qubit with many others in a code block, since errors occurring on that qubit could propagate to the others, exceeding the error-correcting capabilities of the code.",
                        "In our protocol, we are actually deliberately taking this seemingly ill-advised approach: a single qubit () is coupled to every data qubit. The depth of the circuit scales linearly with the number of data qubits, and no error detection or correction is performed during the process. Nevertheless, the procedure is fault-tolerant in that any single-qubit error occurring in the circuit results in a constant-weight error on the final state. An interesting subtlety is that even though a single-qubit circuit-level error can in general be propagated by the subsequent gates to a highly nonlocal error, this nonlocal error is always equivalent under stabilizers of the prepared cluster state to some geometrically local error. More generally, we show that any m-qubit circuit-level error results in at most m geometrically local errors on the final state.",
                        "To summarize, we have discovered that fault-tolerant quantum computation can be achieved through the incremental improvement of a small number of key components, avoiding most of the systems engineering challenges inherent in leading approaches. This is possible because of three important features of our scheme. First, its physical realization only requires manufacturing and calibrating a constant number of experimental components, independent of the number of data qubits. Second, there are readily available physical platforms that can realize our protocol. Third, any constant-weight error occurring during our protocol results in a constant-weight error on the prepared cluster state.",

This cluster state corresponds to the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 5. Their scheme (for constructing this cluster state and extracting the syndrome) boasts a high threshold of pth\u22480.58% [28] under the standard depolarizing model for circuit errors, making it one of the most promising approaches for building a large-scale quantum computer.",

It is straightforward to see that any single-qubit error in this circuit propagates to a constant-weight error on |\u03c8G. Together with the fact that |\u03c8G is a foliation of the surface code [29], this implies that there is a finite threshold for the circuit error rate below which the logical error rate decays exponentially with the system size.",

From the perspective of quantum error correction, this cluster state can be viewed as a space-time history of the surface code [30, 31] with L rounds of syndrome measurements, the bottom and the top boundaries of the cluster state corresponding to the surface codes at the initial and the final step of the error-correction protocol. Our estimates for the logical error rate, which decays exponentially with L under local noise models, quantifies the probability that there is a logical bit or phase flip between the bottom and the top layer.",
                                "The leading architecture for implementing this scheme is based on a two-dimensional array of physical qubits [16, 15, 11]. This approach suffers from an important practical problem, however. The space overhead, which is the ratio between the number of physical qubits and the number of logical qubits, is quite large in practice. For instance, the space overhead for running Shor's algorithm [32], assuming a physical error rate of 10\u22123, is estimated to be at least a few hundred [8, 33]. Thus, building even a single logical qubit with low enough error rate will require hundreds if not thousands of physical components. Moreover, these components will need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the physical error rates across all of the qubits are sufficiently low. While this is not impossible, it certainly requires a Herculean effort."

                                "Generally speaking, large space overhead is undesirable because the effort to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer may grow proportionately with the number of physical qubits. However, for the purpose of assessing the feasibility of a given architecture, it is important to distinguish the mathematical definition of space overhead from the engineering difficulty of building a quantum computer. We believe that a useful figure of merit for the latter is the component overhead, which is the number of basic experimental components used to build a single logical qubit. Of course, the precise definition of \u201cexperimental component\u201d depends on the degrees of freedom that encode the quantum information. Once those degrees of freedom are identified, one can compare different protocols in terms of the required experimental components. This information can be related more directly to the feasibility of the protocol.",
                                "Component overhead can be an informative metric because the basic building blocks that constitute a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer may be difficult to mass manufacture. Even though there are several experiments that report error rates below the thresholds of various fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes [14, 16, 15, 8, 34], these numbers are often obtained in a manner that is incompatible with scalability. This is due to the practical reality that when the components are manufactured, they have sample-to-sample variations which lead to imperfect gates. Often, the reported numbers come from the very best of those samples, but if the variation is not negligible, many of the other samples will generally suffer from higher error rates. Therefore, given that high-quality components are difficult to come by, scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing protocols should aim to minimise the number of such components.",
                                "Motivated by this observation, we construct simple abstract protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation that are amenable to extremely low component overhead. We also present concrete experimental proposals for realizing the protocols using a single transmon qubit interacting with a stream of phonons, or alternatively, an atom interacting with a stream of photons. Our protocols may be applicable more generally, e.g., to systems implemented using ions or neutral atoms. There are two distinguishing features of all these systems that are crucial. First, the degrees of freedom that encode the quantum information are either identical by nature or can be made to be nearly identical. Second, the qubits have long coherence times, leading to low memory error rates.",

FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a physical device for implementing our protocols. A quantum emitter 100 implementing a control qubit  generates propagating modes, e.g., photons or phonons, which implement data qubits. These data qubits are stored in delay lines 106 and 108 between their interactions with the control qubit . These interactions of the quantum emitter on the returning propagating modes implement quantum gates acting on the data qubits. After propagating through the delay line(s), resulting in a constant number of interactions with , each qubit is measured by a detector 110. Routers 102 and 104 are configured to route the qubits through the delay lines a constant number of times before they are sent to the detector. The device may be coupled to a digital controller that controls the operation of the detectors and control qubit in order to implement the methods described herein.",

For example, the routers may be implemented using commercially available optical switches, superconducting circuits that guide the propagation of microwave photons, or one or more multi-mode mechanical oscillators with engineered phonon band structure such that the oscillators guide the propagation of phonons. In optical platform realizations, the detector may be implemented as one or more beam splitters coupled to one or more additional detectors such that photons or phonons in different frequency modes or polarization modes are separated into different spatial modes before detected by the additional detectors. The detectors may be implemented as one or more single photon detectors detecting or distinguishing one or more photons in different frequency modes, polarization modes, or spatial modes. The detectors may be implemented as one or more photon number counters detecting or distinguishing different numbers of photons in a mode. In microwave platform realizations, the detectors may be implemented as one or more microwave cavities coupled to one or more superconducting qubits such that the number of photons, the frequency modes of photons, or the spatial modes of photons in the cavities are identified by measuring the states of the qubits. In some quantum acoustic implementations, the detectors may be implemented as one or more mechanical oscillators coupled to one or more superconducting qubits such that the number of phonons, the frequency modes of phonons, or the spatial modes of phonons in the mechanical oscillators are identified by measuring the states of the qubits. In some implementations, the detectors comprise one or more mechanical oscillators coupled to optical resonators such that the number of phonons, the frequency modes of phonons, or the spatial modes of phonons in the mechanical oscillators are identified by measuring the states of photons from the optical resonators.",
                                "The procedure for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation using the device of FIG. 1 involves two types of qubits, a single actively controlled qubit  and a large number of data qubits. Each data qubit interacts with  several times, and these interactions are separated by time delays determined by the size of the bcc lattice being implemented. The data qubits do not interact with each other. The gates applied between  and the data qubits are specified as described below in the section on cluster state preparation, and experimental techniques for realizing these gates are described in the experimental realization section below. The procedure is an extension of the photonic machine gun proposal of Ref. [35] and variants thereof [20]. These works advocated methods for creating cluster states on one- and two-dimensional lattices, respectively, neither of which are known to be useful resources for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In contrast, our protocol prepares the cluster state on the bcc lattice, which (as discussed in the background section above) can be straightforwardly used as a resource state for fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation.",
                                "Independent of the precise sequence of gates between the control qubit  and the data qubits, any protocol implemented on the device depicted in FIG. 1 is at risk of being strongly susceptible to noise. There are two potential sources of concern. The first is that  interacts with every single data qubit, without any intermediate syndrome measurements being performed. This creates the danger that an error occurring on  could propagate to all of the data qubits that subsequently interact with . The second issue is that there is a time delay between successive interactions of the same data qubit with . For generating an L\u00d7L\u00d7N bcc lattice, the total time delay is proportional to L2. Thus, the total memory error accumulated during these time delays may be significant.",
                                "The first of these is actually a non-issue. As discussed in the error analysis section, an important feature of our protocols is that even though single-qubit errors, including those on , may propagate to highly nonlocal errors, the effect of these errors on the prepared cluster state is always equivalent to that of geometrically local errors. Hence, using the standard depolarizing noise model for circuit errors and the usual minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, there is a finite threshold for the circuit error rate. We find threshold values of 0.23% and 0.39%, depending on the details of the protocol (see the section on 3D cluster states and the section below on thresholds). Therefore, if memory errors are negligible, the logical error rate can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing L.",
                                "In contrast, for non-negligible memory error rates, the logical error rate cannot be made arbitrarily small, since increasing L also leads to an increase in the total error incurred during the time delays. We study these effects in the section on the effect of delay line errors by assuming a nonzero error rate r, per time step. As long as the circuit error rate is below threshold, we argue that by judiciously choosing L, the logical error rate can be made exponentially small in \u03b7\u22121/2. We perform extensive numerical simulations, whose results show excellent agreement with this prediction. Since the logical error rate decays significantly faster than \u03b7 for small values of \u03b7, the effect of memory error can be mitigated.",
                                "The fact that our scheme leads to small but not arbitrarily small logical error rates is reminiscent of the fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes using anyons [30, 36, 37, 38] or 0-\u03c0 qubits [39, 40, 41]. In these approaches, the logical error rate is exponentially small in some large physical parameter. In ours, this parameter is \u03b7\u22121/2."

This is easily verified using Table 1. As an example, an X error on  between gates  and  in Ak results in an effective error Zk\u2212LMZk\u22121, while a Z error at this location results in a Zk error, and k, k\u2212LM, k\u22121\u2208{k}\u222aNc(k).",

Note that the remaining steps, Lines 2-5, of Protocol A do not propagate this effective error further, as Z errors commute with Z gates and do not affect Z-measurements. By the same argument, a single-qubit Z error occurring during Lines 2-5 does not propagate to other qubits. It is also clear that a single-qubit X error on qubit i occurring during these steps is equivalent to Z errors on a subset of Nc(i). It follows that the effective error on |\u03c8Gbcc resulting from any single-qubit error in Protocol A is geometrically local with respect to Gc, i.e., supported within the neighborhood {i}\u222aNc(i) of some qubit i\u2208[n].

In Protocol A, no intermediate measurements are ever performed during the preparation of |\u03c8G, yet all of the effective errors are geometrically local with respect to Gc (see Table 1). It is surprising that there is a nontrivial extensive-depth fault-tolerant protocol without intermediate measurements; the usual approach involves frequent intermediate measurements to extract syndrome information, so that one can catch the errors.

For example, suppose that an X error occurs on a qubit i\u2208Vc\\Vbcc immediately before the Z-measurement of i in Line 3 of Protocol A. By Eq. (2), this results in a Z error on all of the neighbors of i in Gc, which constitutes a weight-6 error on the face qubits of an elementary cell of Gbcc (see FIG. 3).

In addition, each data qubit is lost by the end of the procedure with probability ploss. Hence, Error Model 2 reduces to Error Model 1 for ploss=0. We assume that if a qubit i is lost at some point, then any subsequent operation on i is replaced by the identity operator followed by depolarizing noise with rate p. The assumption that losses are detectable and that operations involving lost qubits implement the identity is consistent with the experimental setup considered in the experimental realization section.",

Indeed, single and double chains of one-dimensional cluster states have already been produced in experiments using photons emitted from quantum dots [56]. These experiments implement modified versions of the circuit in Ref. [35], which is a specific instance of Algorithm 1. The techniques detailed in Refs. [20, 35] can be adapted to our more general protocols, to create cluster states on different graphs. In particular, the experimental setup considered in Ref. [20] can be directly extended to implement the first step of Protocol A (see FIG. 4), providing a simple procedure for preparing a three-dimensional cluster state on a cubic lattice. Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation can then be performed by making adaptive single-qubit measurements on this state [14].",

A second ingredient is to coordinate the interactions between  and the data qubits such that these operations are applied in the correct order.

[20], a single delay line is used to generate a cluster state on a two-dimensional square lattice with shifted periodic boundary conditions. This procedure can be generalized to prepare the cluster state on the cubic lattice Gc defined in the section on Protocol A, by introducing two delay lines of appropriate lengths to realize the circuit of Line 1 of Protocol A (see FIG. 4).",

By setting the delay times for Delay 1 and Delay 2 to D1= and D2=(3L(M\u22121)\u22121), respectively, where  is the pulse-to-pulse time separation between distinct data qubit modes, one obtains a cluster state on an L\u00d7M\u00d7N cubic lattice Gc. The multiplicative factor of 3 accounts for the fact that there are up to three interactions in every block (see Eq. (10)). The delay times D1 and D2 can be effectively tuned using well-established techniques such as electromagnetically induced transparency [57] for coherent atomic media or band-structure engineering for photonic/phononic crystals [58].",

For example, the emitter creates the first data qubit at node 1102 of the circuit diagram, then interacts with it at node 1104 after it has passed through the first delay line, and interacts with it again at node 1106 after it has passed through the second delay line. The generalization of this procedure to the dual-rail scheme is straightforward.

As a result, the cumulative effect of delay line errors may be non-negligible. If the cluster state size becomes too large, the total error incurred in the delay lines overwhelms the improved error correction properties due to the increased code distance, leading to high logical error rates. In this section, we study two phenomenological models that incorporate the effect of delay line errors, and determine how the optimal logical error rate depends on the delay line error rate in each model. These models address the increase in loss probability with delay line length as well as dephasing errors on the data qubits, two effects that were ignored in the error analysis section."

We parameterize these models using the delay line error per time step. Here, the time it takes to execute the block of gates in Line 4 of Algorithm 1 constitutes one time step, and the time to measure and reset  in Lines 6 and 9 constitutes another time step. We assume that the time steps are equal. (To elaborate, we assume that the operations are temporally arranged, by pulsing or measuring  at appropriately spaced intervals, such that these time steps are all of the same length. This allows for the geometry of the bcc lattice to be naturally realized in Protocol B, since the measurements of  coincide with the sites in the bcc lattice that are \u201cmissing\u201d relative to the cubic lattice (see FIG. 5).) In Protocol B, for instance, each time step consists either of a controlled-X gate, a Hadamard gate, and up to two controlled-Z gates, or of a measurement and re-initialization of . Thus, for preparing a cluster state on an L\u00d7M\u00d7N lattice, there are L time steps in Delay 1 and L(M\u22121) time steps in Delay 2 (see FIG. 1 and FIG. 11). We will use \u03b7Z and \u03b7loss to represent the dephasing error and loss per time step, respectively.",
                                "Let us make a brief comment on how these delay line errors change the analysis in the error analysis section. Dephasing errors are generally equivalent to stochastic Pauli Z errors, while the effect of losing a qubit during the procedure depends on the encoding scheme and gate implementations. In the experimental setup described in the experimental realization section above, the loss of a data qubit simply results in any subsequent gates involving that qubit not being applied. This is because these gates are realized via interactions between a photon/phonon wavepacket with the emitter. If the wavepacket is not present, the interaction does not occur. Moreover, in the dual-rail scheme described above, losses are detectable. We can therefore use the decoder of Ref. [28] as we did in the section on thresholds.",

We omit the depolarizing channel that occurs after the initialization of each data qubit. This is motivated by the fact that in our experimental setup, each photon/phonon is created by the process that implements the controlled-X gate (see Eq. (16)). Strictly, this differs from Algorithm 1 (as it is formally stated), in which a data qubit i is initialized first, before  is applied to it in a separate step. In order to be able to suppress error, the circuit error rate p should be below the threshold for this modified error model. Since the threshold for Error Model 1 was estimated to be pth=0.39% (for Protocol B), we will assume that p=10\u22123, which is a standard number used in the literature for studying the sub-threshold behavior of the surface code [11].",

In both models, every single-qubit gate on a qubit a is followed by a single-qubit depolarizing channel a(p) (see Eq. (13)). Every measurement of a qubit a is preceded by a(p), and every (re-)initialization of  is followed by . Similarly, every two-qubit gate on qubits a and b is followed by a two-qubit depolarizing channel a,b(p) (see Eq. (14)). In Error Model 3a, in addition to these circuit errors, a dephasing channel",

If a qubit i is lost at some point, then any subsequent operation on i is replaced by the identity operator followed by i(p). In the following discussion, we will often refer to the delay line error rate as \u03b7, where \u03b7 is \u03b7Z for Error Model 3a and \u03b7loss for Error Model 3b. (In reality, one would expect both dephasing and loss errors to occur in an experiment. Analysing their effects separately greatly simplifies the numerics, however. In many circumstances, one form of noise will dominate, in which case the results for the corresponding error model should provide a good guide to the performance of the protocol.)",

As in the section on thresholds, we infer the effect that each physical error has on the final state using Table 2 and Eq. (9), and we use the generalized MWPM decoder of Ref.

Assuming that a single time step lasts 50 ns, we obtain a loss rate of 1.4\u00d710\u22123 dB per time step, which amounts to \u03b7loss\u22489.6\u00d710\u22124.

In particular, the cooperativity  is the ratio between the probabilities that  emits a photon into a guided mode versus into unwanted modes. In order to obtain logical error suppression,  needs to be sufficiently large, such that the total loss probability is below the loss thresholds found in the section on thresholds. Thus, it is important to achieve a high cooperativity, e.g., 100. Reducing photon loss at the interfaces of different optical elements and improving the qubit coherence time (in the case of quantum dots) is also important.",

[60], an array of microwave resonators is used to realize a one-dimensional waveguide with delay time \u2248227 ns. The waveguide is coupled to a qubit with photon emission rate \u03931D2\u03c0\u00d721 MHz. This capability implies that around \u03931D\u224830 propagating photons can be stored inside the waveguide. Thus, integrated superconducting circuits are also a physical platform to implement our protocols.",

A single-mode phononic waveguide [26] and an extremely long phonon lifetime (T1\u22481.5 s and T20.3 ms) [55] have already been demonstrated in two separate experiments. Providing a strong coupling regime with a high cooperativity by fabricating integrated nanostructures (similar to superconducting circuits [59]), quantum acoustic systems can realize our protocols for reasonably large system sizes. For example, with optimistic but reasonable estimates T2\u22481 ms and \u03b3\u2248100 MHz, where \u03b3 is the coupling strength, one can choose a pulse-to-pulse time separation \u2248160 ns to realize high-fidelity gates with error rates below our threshold of pth\u22480.39%. (Here, we assumed that the gate fidelity scales as 1\u22121/(\u03b3)2 based on symmetric wavepackets of phonons [20].) This choice of  would lead to a delay line error rate per time step of \u03b7Z\u22483/T2\u22484.8\u00d710\u22124. (Note: The logical error rates achievable for other values of /T2 are tabulated in Table 3.) Although this is above the break-even point 6.5\u00d710\u22125, we note that the experimental technology for quantum acoustic systems is in its early stages and advancing rapidly. Through improving fabrication methods for integrated circuits and lowering the temperature, the coherence times of both qubits and a delay lines may be substantially increased."

In contrast, standard protocols based on three-dimensional cluster states or the surface code [22, 16, 15, 11, 61] are expected to require hundreds if not thousands of experimental components.",

Likewise, the reader may wonder how our scheme fares in comparison to those based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code [62]. This quantum error-correcting code for a qubit in an oscillator was recently used to demonstrate error suppression [63] by coupling cavity modes that form a GKP code to a transmon. For the protocol used, the logical error rate is determined by (i) a number that decays exponentially with \u03c3\u22122, where a is the standard deviation of the Gaussian displacement channel [64] modeling the dominant source of error on the modes, and (ii) the transmon error rate p. The dominant source of error in Ref. [63] limiting the logical error rate is (ii), leading to a logical error rate that is significantly higher than what (i) might na\u00efvely suggest. The contribution from (ii) can be reduced to O(p2) by using a recently proposed fault-tolerant method for preparing GKP states [65], in which case we expect the logical error rate to be limited by O(p2).",
                                "In contrast, in an analogous setting, the logical error rate of our protocols decays exponentially with \u03b7\u22121/2, even if the transmon error rate is significantly higher. Specifically, it suffices for the transmon error rate to be lower than some threshold value, which we have estimated to be 0.39% in the standard depolarizing noise model for circuit errors. Therefore, while approaches based on the GKP code may seem advantageous at the moment, with improved gate fidelities our scheme may be able to outperform them in the future.",
                                "From a more theoretical perspective, our protocols have a remarkable fault-tolerance property. Even though there is one physical qubit that interacts with every other qubit during the preparation of the cluster state, the procedure is nonetheless fault-tolerant because any single-qubit circuit-level error results in a constant-weight error on the final state. What is interesting about this phenomenon is that the propagated error may actually be highly nonlocal, yet its effect on the specific state we wish to prepare is always the same as that of a geometrically local error. Similarly, the effect of any m-qubit circuit-level error on the final state is equivalent to that of at most m geometrically local errors. In fact, this applies not only to our protocols (Protocols A and B) for preparing the specific cluster state of Ref. [14], but to our general algorithm (Algorithm 1), which can be used to prepare the cluster state corresponding to any graph. (For general cluster states, geometric locality is defined with respect to the underlying graph; see the section below on error analysis for arbitrary graphs.)",
                                "By leveraging this fact, we were able to construct fault-tolerant quantum circuits whose depth necessarily scales with the total number of qubits. This is certainly unusual. Fault-tolerant quantum computing protocols usually avoid circuits structured like ours because of the danger that they will spread errors too widely. This often restricts the design of these protocols, leading them to rely on a small number of trusted and manifestly fault-tolerant building blocks, such as transversal gates or \u201ccatch-and-correct\u201d [66]. Our work shows that there can be a subtle form of fault-tolerance in which physical errors spread but without adverse effects. This observation may prove useful for generalizing our methods to other fault-tolerance schemes. Indeed, Algorithm 1 can immediately be used to generate cluster states obtained by foliating arbitrary stabilizer codes [29, 67]. The fault-tolerance of the resulting protocols can be analyzed with the help of Table 4 in the section on error analysis for Algorithm 1.",
                                "There are several variations an alternate instantiations of the above that we envision. For one, the decoder we used in our simulations was the most basic MWPM decoder, which did not take into account matching degeneracies nor the anisotropy of the underlying error model. Thus, we envision the option of using decoders that exploit additional information to obtain better logical error rates and thresholds. Also, leveraging recent work on using so-called flag techniques to make error-correction schemes more efficient [68, 66, 69, 70], it is envisioned to use such techniques to improve our protocols as well. More generally, it could be advantageous to trade a slowly growing component overhead for improved error tolerance. For instance, one could adapt our protocols to build cluster states on an L\u00d7L\u00d7N lattice using O(L) emitters instead of the single emitter discussed here. Such a scheme would still have component overhead parametrically smaller than the O(L2) physical qubits live in the system. An analogous trade-off was found in [71] between the number of emitters and the entanglement generation rate in the context of quantum communication using cluster states [72, 73]. Another strategy would be to concatenate our scheme, replacing our bare single- or dual-rail qubits with qubits protected by error correction, using e.g., GKP [62] or binomial codes [74]. Conversely, our scheme could be used as the inner code, choosing a small value of L (e.g., 10 or less) to make the logical error rate sufficiently small, e.g., 10\u22125. We can then concatenate this with a lower-overhead outer code, which may have a low pseudo-threshold."

(More precisely, since multiple operators fit the definition of an effective error resulting from a particular circuit-level error (see Eq. (8)), none of the effective errors corresponding to these single-qubit circuit-level errors are geometrically local.) It follows that for any graph that does not contain a Hamiltonian path, Algorithm 2 does not yield for any possible ordering of the qubits a preparation circuit for which the effective errors are all geometrically local. As another example, certain single-qubit errors occurring in the circuit given by Equation 2 of Ref. [20], which prepares a two-dimensional cluster state, would lead to nonlocal errors. This results from the inclusion of several redundant controlled-Z gates. (It should be noted, however, that the experimental protocol proposed in Ref.

More generally, by adding redundant controlled-Z gates, it is in fact possible to construct circuits in which certain single-qubit errors induce effective errors whose weights necessarily scale with the number of qubits.",
