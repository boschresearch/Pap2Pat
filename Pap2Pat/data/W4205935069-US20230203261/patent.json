                        "Foamed and expanded polyolefins have long been used for applications requiring lightweight materials, with properties such as heat and sound insulation. Amongst the most ubiquitous expanded polyolefins is expanded polystyrene (XPS), typically used for packaging materials. An alternative to XPS is expanded polypropylene (EPP).",
                        "Expanded polypropylene is a highly versatile foamed material exhibiting excellent energy absoption, impact resistance, water and chemical resistance, exceptionally high strength to weight ratio and 100% recyclability.",
                        "The most efficient method for producing expanded polypropylene articles comprises first forming expanded polypropylene beads, which are subsequently molded together to form an article. The typical method for forming said expanded beads involves an autoclave process, which delivers excellent results, however such processes are notoriously expensive and complex. A more economical method involves the formation of the expanded polypropylene beads directly in the extrusion process. Efficient methods have been developed, however beads produced in such processes typically require much more forcing conditions to fuse the beads together when molding foamed articles. Beads formed in the autoclave process typically require steam pressures of 3 to 4 bar in a steam chest molding process, whilst extruded beads typically require steam pressures of 4 to 8 bar. This higher pressure requirement means that only specialized equipment can be used in the molding process, whereas lower pressure steam chest molding equipment is far more prevalent, as it can also be used for fusing XPS beads and autoclave EPP beads.",
                        "There is therefore a need for new expanded polypropylene beads being suitable for steam chest molding at lower pressures, in order to enable highly economical manufacture of expanded polypropylene articles.",
                        "It is generally held in the field, e.g. in KR 101014002 B1, that the formation of expanded polypropylene beads having multiple melting temperatures is beneficial for the formation of molded articles therefrom.",
                        "US 6 315 931 B1 achieves a similar effect by producing foamed particles enclosed in a film, whilst EP 0 778 310 B1 relies on multiple foaming stages.",
                        "EP 3 489 287 A1 describes pre-expanded polypropylene beads having low open cell content and beneficial molding properties made by selecting highly specialized polypropylene-based resins following the inequation: tan \u03b4 \u2264 0.32 \u00d7 V + 0.1. Whilst theoretically a promising development, the very strict limitations on the choice of polypropylene-based resins mean that this process is limited in practice.",

In principle a melt is pressed or extruded through a round die and the resulting strand is hauled off. The stress on the extrudate is recorded, as a function of melt properties and measuring parameters (especially the ratio between output and haul-off speed, practically a measure for the extension rate). For the results presented below, the materials were extruded with a lab extruder HAAKE Polylab system and a gear pump with cylindrical die (L/D= 6.0/2.0 mm). The gear pump was pre-adjusted to a throughput of 2.1 g/min with pressure before the gear pump of 30 bar, and the melt temperature was set to 200\u00b0 C. The spinline length between die and Rheotens wheels was 100 mm. At the beginning of the experiment, the take-up speed of the Rheotens wheels was adjusted to the velocity of the extruded polymer strand (tensile force zero): Then the experiment was started by slowly increasing the take-up speed of the Rheotens wheels until the polymer filament breaks. The acceleration of the wheels was small enough so that the tensile force was measured under quasisteady conditions. The acceleration of the melt strand (2) drawn down is 120 mm/s2. The Rheotens was operated in combination with the PC program EXTENS. This is a real-time data-acquisition program, which displays and stores the measured data of tensile force and drawdown speed. The end points of the Rheotens curve (force versus pulley rotary speed) is taken as the Fmax and Vmax.",

Thereby, a low g\u2032-value is an indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the g\u2032-value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene increases.

As a measurement device, a viscoelastic measuring device ARES manufactured by TA Instruments was used. A \u03d525 mm parallel plate type jig was attached to the viscoelastic measuring device. A constant temperature bath was arranged so as to surround the jig, and the constant temperature bath was kept heated at 200\u00b0 C. so that the jig was preheated. Subsequently, the constant temperature bath was opened, and the \u03d525 mm test piece was inserted between parallel plates. The constant temperature bath was then closed, and the test piece was preheated for 5 minutes. Thereafter, a gap between the parallel plates was narrowed to 1 mm so that the test piece was compressed. After compression, the constant temperature bath was opened again, and a resin which protruded from the parallel plates was removed with use of a brass spatula. The constant temperature bath was closed, and the constant temperature bath was kept heated for 5 minutes. After that, measurement of dynamic viscoelastic behavior was started. The measurement was carried out at an angular frequency in a range of 0.1 rad/s to 100 rad/s. A storage modulus of elasticity and a loss modulus of elasticity at each angular frequency were obtained, and a loss tangent tan \u03b4 at the each angular frequency was obtained as a calculated value. Out of those results, a value of a loss tangent tan \u03b4 at an angular frequency of 0.1 rad/s was employed.

It comprises a 45 mm and L/D=42 twin-screw extruder with 6 gravimetric feeders and a gas dosing station capable of feeding 3 different blowing agents, a type 425 \u2018Torpedo\u2019 melt cooler, an SMB Plus DN40 static mixer and die plate. The blowing agent(s) can be added in the extruder. The extruder has heating elements and a water-cooling system controlled by a proprietary algorithm, in order to maintain constant and even temperature distribution throughout the housings and the melt. The impregnated melt is transferred into a conditioning section mainly consisting of a heat exchanger that allows for even temperature control throughout the melt. The polymer melt is then volumetrically dosed by a gear pump and optionally passes through a sieve before entering the diverter valve. The gear pump is used to ensure a constant melt flow and pressure for pelletization, which is done by underwater pelletization. The temperature of melt cooler, gear pump, filter, diverter valve and die of the pilot plant is controlled by three independent thermal oil heat transfer units (HTU).",

Isobutane is injected directly into the extruder via an injection valve. Melt temperature is adjusted to 133\u00b0 C. by melt cooler and the temperature at the die plate is adjusted to 142\u00b0 C. A high PDR die plate, having 12 channels, each having a diameter of 1.1 mm and a land length of 5.0 mm was used to achieve a PDR of greater than 5000 bar/s.",

A crack filling method and steam pressure > 4 bar are required to form a coherent part from CE2.

The article of CE4 has inferior compression strength at both 25% strain and 50%. Whilst CE2b does exhibit good compression strength, the high open cell count will impact the insulation properties and the requirement for a crack filling steam chest method with long steaming times limits production of the molded articles."
