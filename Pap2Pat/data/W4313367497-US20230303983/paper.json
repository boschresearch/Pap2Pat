    "title": "High-efficiency purification of divergent AAV serotypes using AAVX affinity chromatography",
    "date": "2023-03-01",
    "abstract": "The adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) provides a safe and efficient gene therapy platform with several approved products that have marked therapeutic impact for patients. However, a major bottleneck in the development and commercialization of AAV remains the efficiency, cost, and scalability of AAV production. Chromatographic methods have the potential to allow purification at increased scales and lower cost but often require optimization specific to each serotype. Here, we demonstrate that the POROS CaptureSelect AAVX affinity resin efficiently captures a panel of 15 divergent AAV serotypes, including the commonly used AAV2, AAV8, AAV9, PHP.B, and Anc80. We also find that AAVX resin can be regenerated repeatedly without loss of efficiency or carry-over contamination. While AAV preps purified with AAVX showed a higher fraction of empty capsids than preps purified using iodixanol ultracentrifugation, the potency of the AAVX purified vectors was comparable with that of iodixanol purified vectors both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, optimization of the purification protocol resulted in a process with an overall efficiency of 65%\u201380% across all scales and AAV serotypes tested. These data establish AAVX affinity chromatography as a versatile and efficient method for purification of a broad range of AAV serotypes.",

                "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are small, non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses discovered in the 1960s as contaminants of adenovirus preparations.1,2 They induce limited host immune response and are not associated with any known disease, yet were found to be highly efficient at delivering DNA cargo to many tissues in multiple animal species.3 AAV vectors are thus widely used as a gene transfer tool in basic research and in translational and clinical gene therapy.4 Their higher use has increased demand for AAV manufacturing both in terms of the quality of the preparation and the quantity of the material.",
                "Currently, for research and for some clinical purposes, the commonly used AAV purification method uses ultracentrifugation of the sample on a cesium chloride (CsCl) or iodixanol density gradient.5,6,7 This process is appealing for two reasons: first, it is serotype agnostic with little process optimization needed for the various AAV products researchers seek to purify; and second, it remains one of the more efficient methods of separation of genome-containing (or \u201cfull\u201d) capsids from empty or partially filled capsids. However, ultracentrifugation is a manual multi-step processes (sample concentration, preparation of density gradient, sample loading, centrifugation, and aspiration of the target layer). This makes it labor intensive and difficult to scale, and adds a requirement for precise handling.8 Finally, ultracentrifugation may co-purify contaminants that have the same sedimentation coefficient as AAV.8",
                "Liquid chromatography provides a more scalable, less laborious, and possibly more efficient purification method, particularly under high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) conditions, as has been shown for the purification of proteins and small molecules.9 For AAV, several chromatographic methods have been developed, most using AVB Sepharose affinity, cation exchange, or anion exchange chromatography.10,11,12,13 While these methods demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of AAV chromatographic purification, they also require substantial serotype-specific optimization. Thus, they are not optimal for AAV purification in a research setting, where different serotypes need to be purified for different applications in a flexible process.",
                "Recently, several AAV binding resins have been commercially released, including AVB resin (AVB Sepharose High Performance; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and POROS CaptureSelect AAV8, AAV9, and AAVX resins (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In the case of AVB resin, it was shown that affinity chromatography using AVB can efficiently purify AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, and rh10, but requires serotype-specific optimization and does not bind to multiple other serotypes, including AAV8 and AAV9.13,14 POROS CaptureSelect AAV8 and AAV9 resins bind and were specifically developed for purification of AAV8 and AAV9, respectively, but not other serotypes (POROS CaptureSelect product datasheet).11,13 POROS CaptureSelect AAVX is a 50-\u03bcm resin consisting of a rigid crosslinked poly(styrene divinylbenzene) bead backbone, coated with crosslinked polyhydroxylated polymer, and linked to a camelid heavy-chain-only single-domain antibody fragment. The camelid antibody was raised against a conserved region of the AAV capsid, and the AAVX resin is marketed as a pan-AAV affinity resin capable of binding multiple different AAV serotypes (POROS CaptureSelect product datasheet).11 However, to date there are no independently generated published data on assessing the performance of AAVX. For this reason, we sought to evaluate the AAVX resin for its ability to bind various AAV serotypes and its utility to be incorporated into a fully integrated AAV purification process."

                        "We first sought to test, on a small scale, which serotypes bind to the POROS CaptureSelect AAVX resin (subsequently denoted as AAVX). To this end, the phylogenetically diverse AAV serotypes AAV2, AAV2_HSPG, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6.2, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, rh10, rh32.33, PHP.B, Anc80, and AAV7m81,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 (Figure\u00a01A) were produced at small scale, purified via ultracentrifugation on an iodixanol gradient, and applied to the AAVX resin bed in a static binding assay. After incubation, resin was washed with PBS, AAV was eluted using 0.1\u00a0M citric acid and quantified in different fractions using qPCR (Figure\u00a01B). The result of this binding assay demonstrates that AAVX binds all of the tested serotypes with relatively high efficiency, similarly to the positive control of AAV9 incubated with the POROS AAV9 resin. Recovery was >95% for all serotypes tested except for Anc80, which showed around 80% recovery. On the other hand, the control sample of AAV2 incubated with the POROS AAV9 resin showed poor (<5%) binding efficiency (Figure\u00a01B). This suggests that the AAVX resin has broad affinity and may significantly improve the purification process for divergent serotypes.Figure\u00a01AAV purification using AAVX affinity chromatography(A) Phylogeny depicting the diversity of AAV capsids included in this report (bold) along with the percent identity (by amino acid) compared with AAV9.

                        "Next, we aimed to determine whether AAV vectors could be purified with the AAVX resin via HPLC, choosing the Corning HYPERFlask (560\u00a0mL harvest volume, 1,720\u00a0cm2 surface area) as the process development vessel for scale-up production. We chose AAV2 and Anc80 because of their high sequence divergence and broad research and clinical utility, and for both serotypes we purified preparations from a single HYPERFlask using AAVX-HPLC. In short, the production and purification process consisted of triple transfection of adherent HEK293 cells, cell pellet and medium harvest and high salt lysis 3\u00a0days post transfection, benzonase treatment, clarification of lysate by centrifugation and filtration, and AAVX affinity chromatographic purification at room temperature with immediate neutralization of the eluted vector. The vector was then sterilized through 0.22-\u03bcm filtration and buffer-exchanged final buffer exchanges, and concentrated using a 50\u00a0kDa molecular weight cutoff filtration unit (Amicon Ultra-15). Recovery in each of the different chromatography fractions (Figure\u00a0S1) was quantified by qPCR for DNAse-resistant vector genomes (Figure\u00a01C). Results from these experiments indicated that the majority of input vector was found in the elution fraction, with only a minor fraction of vector lost in the flow-through or Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and ethanol fractions. Additional preps indicated that combined average purification efficiency for both AAV2 and Anc80 without serotype-specific optimization was around 50% (Figure\u00a01D). The average yield of AAV2 and Anc80 from this initial process was 1013 vector genomes (vg) of AAV per HYPERFlask, which was maintained for the serotypes AAV9 and PHP.eB (Figure\u00a01E)."

                        "Next, we aimed to determine whether HPLC purification of AAV with AAVX also functions at small scale and whether resin can be re-used multiple times without contamination or loss of efficiency. Re-using resin is of interest because it decreases the cost and labor associated with AAV purification and allows automatic back-to-back purification of multiple preparations. We produced five different AAV1 preps at small scale (from one and a half 15-cm dishes per prep), whereby the vectors of the second to fifth AAV prep were identical except for a unique 100-bp DNA barcode region (Figure\u00a02A). We purified the preps consecutively from prep 1 to prep 5 using the same bed of resin. The resin was regenerated using 6\u00a0M guanidine and equilibrated with TBS and 20% ethanol washes between each run. We then quantified the vector genomes in the input lysate, the flow-through, and final elution via qPCR (Figure\u00a02B). Throughout the experiment most of the input vector was found in the elution fraction (<2% found in flow-through), and there was no detectable loss of purification efficiency. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing of the barcode region in the fifth prep showed that the majority (99.93%) of genomes found in the elution fraction came from the correct fifth prep, not preps 2\u20134 (Figure\u00a02C). These results indicate that resin can be re-used multiple times without considerable loss of efficiency or carry-over contamination. We observed similar results with different batches of AAVX resin in other experiments (see Figures\u00a0S2 and S3), indicating low AAVX batch-to-batch variability.Figure\u00a02Effect of resin regeneration and temperature on purification efficiency(A) Overview of experimental design of figures (B)\u00a0and (C). Five small-scale AAV1 preps were produced and purified sequentially on HPLC with AAVX resin without changing the resin between purifications. One prep contained AAV from one and a half 15-cm dishes. Preps 2\u20135 were identical except for a 100-bp barcode region. Vector genomes were quantified across all purifications. For the fifth prep, the barcode region was PCR amplified and next-generation sequenced, and the unique barcodes corresponding to each prep were quantified to estimate carry-over contamination from preps 2\u20134. AAV was applied to a column packed with 1\u00a0mL of AAVX resin at 1\u00a0mL/min flow rate at room temperature. (B) Purification efficiency with repeated resin use.

                        "Using the same method as described above, we also asked whether the addition of Pluronic F-68 to HPLC buffers increases purification efficiencies. Pluronic F-68 is a non-ionic surfactant that has been shown to decrease AAV non-specific binding to various surfaces including plasticware.24,25 As HPLC contains long and narrow plastic tubing, we reasoned that addition of Pluronic F-68 may increase purification efficiency by reducing AAV binding to plastic. To test this hypothesis, we added Pluronic F-68 to HPLC buffers to the concentration of 0.1% v/v and repeated the experiment described in Figure\u00a02A (Figure\u00a0S2A). The results indicate that Pluronic F-68 did not increase elution efficiencies for AAV1. However, it showed a trend toward increased efficiencies at the post-elution purification steps (Figures\u00a0S2B and S2C) and did not increase carry-over contamination (Figures\u00a0S2D and S2E). This indicates that Pluronic F-68 is a safe addition to HPLC buffers and may be considered for serotypes that are known to be strongly affected by binding to plastic."

                        "A major challenge in AAV manufacturing during the downstream process is to prepare stable viral vectors, preventing degradation and maintaining production efficiency in a reproducible and cost-effective way. For this reason, HPLC machines are commonly housed and operated at low ambient temperatures (4\u00b0C or 10\u00b0C) to improve protein stability. As such, we evaluated the role of temperature on purification efficiency during AAV9 and PHP.eB purification. We found that a substantial proportion of vector (40%\u201350%) was lost in flow-through at 10\u00b0C whereas viral losses accounted for less than 5% at 24\u00b0C (Figure\u00a02D). However, viral vector degradation due to external factors such as high ambient temperature can adversely impact stability and transduction efficiency of the viral product. We therefore tested thermal stability of clarified viral harvests during the downstream process by keeping AAV input virus at 24\u00b0C and assessing vector degradation using qPCR quantification over 4\u00a0days. The results indicate that AAV titers were stable over the 4-day timeline (Figure\u00a02E). Overall, these results indicate that purification at ambient (24\u00b0C) temperatures reduces viral loss during purification and that AAV remains stable at these temperatures during the timeline of the purification process."

                        "AAVX affinity purification can be utilized for a variety of viral vectors; however, optimization of the various workflow steps will enable more cost-effective, high-yield, and reproducible production. We therefore performed a granular downstream optimization process for production of a larger scale (up to 1014 vg) of AAV. Major challenges in the workflow included efficient lysis and the design of filtration and final formulation steps that minimize AAV loss. This optimization resulted in a process with the following components (see supplemental protocol for process details):1.In situ cell lysis using detergents and nucleases. Based on the protocol described by Florencio et\u00a0al. 26 and our own observations, in\u00a0situ lysis using detergents and nucleases is as efficient as separate lysis of the cell pellet and may be more efficient than in situ lysis using hypertonic salt. To obtain one-step lysis and DNA/RNA removal, we added RNase A (4.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), Turbonuclease (2.5\u00a0U/mL), Triton X-(0.5% v/v), and Pluronic F-68 (0.001% v/v) to the HYPERFlask and incubated for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C with orbital shaking at 150\u00a0rpm to aid lysis with mechanical forces (see supplemental protocol for details). Here, Triton X-100 and RNase A act as primary lysis agents, Turbonuclease acts to degrade plasmid and cell DNA, and Pluronic F-68 serves to decrease potential AAV binding to plastics.2.Addition of Pluronic F-68 to all buffers. Based on our observation that the addition of Pluronic F-68 does not reduce HPLC purification efficiencies (Figure\u00a0S2), and based on multiple anecdotal sources indicating that the coating of plastic and/or filter surfaces with surfactants may reduce protein binding, we added Pluronic F-68 at 0.01% v/v to the elution buffer and incubated all plasticware that came into contact with AAV with a Pluronic F-68 containing solution (Final Formulation Buffer [FFB]: 1\u00d7 PBS, 172\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.001% Pluronic F-68) for approximately 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Additionally, pipette tips and serological pipettes are similarly coated with FFB prior to handling AAV.3.Stringent resin cleaning with 0.1\u00a0M phosphoric acid and 6\u00a0M guanidine. While we observed no loss in AAV binding efficiencies with resin re-use at small scales with AAV1 (Figures\u00a02 and S2), we did observe some loss of binding efficiencies with re-use at large scales, particularly for PHP.eB (data not shown). Based on the recommendations of the AAVX manufacturers (A. Becerra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, personal communication), we increased resin-cleaning stringency from a 5-min wash with 6\u00a0M guanidine alone to a 15-min wash with 0.1\u00a0M phosphoric acid (pH 1), followed by 15-min wash with 6\u00a0M guanidine-HCl. These changes restored efficient resin binding to up to at least six resin regenerations for both AAV9 and PHP.eB (Figures\u00a0S3A and S3B) with no significant AAV losses in flow-through (Figure\u00a0S3C).4.Improvement of buffer exchange. Our analysis indicated substantial losses at the buffer exchange step (25%\u201350%; data not shown). This can be caused by AAV binding to plastic/filter surfaces, shear stress, or overconcentration on the filter surface during buffer exchange, leading to aggregation, sedimentation, and/or loss of functionality of AAV. To mitigate loss of AAV due to binding, we pre-treated all filters/plasticware with 0.001% Pluronic F-68 as described above. To reduce vector loss due to overconcentration and precipitation, we switched to Amicon Stirred Cell concentrators, which allow for use of higher volumes and continuous mixing during concentration, reducing aggregation and sedimentation. Alternatively, we used Amicon Ultra-15 filter concentrators with frequent (every 2\u00a0min of centrifugation) mixing and washing of the filter and did not exceed a total of approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 vg of AAV per one concentrator. The resulting process is summarized in Figure\u00a03A qPCR analysis of the amount of AAV found in different fractions of the optimized process indicate high recovery efficiencies at every step, with an overall average purification efficiency of approximately 80% for AAV9 and approximately 65% for PHP.eB (Figure\u00a03B), with a combined overall purification efficiency of approximately 75% (Figure\u00a03C). This is driven by a considerable increase in efficiency at the filter sterilization and buffer exchange steps compared with the non-optimized protocol (Figure\u00a03D). Using the optimized protocol, we obtained an average yield of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 vg per HYPERFlask across multiple vectors packaged with different transgenes, albeit this analysis also includes some vectors with transgenes that lead to lower than average production yields (Figure\u00a03E). After all of the aforementioned modifications to the process were introduced, analysis of AAV loss at each step indicated that less than 5% of AAV is lost in the flow-through or at the filter sterilization steps, while 10% and 20% on average are lost at the buffer exchange and elution steps, respectively (Figure\u00a0S4), indicating potential targets for future optimization.Figure\u00a03Optimized AAVX affinity purification process(A) Process steps of the protocol. (B) Stepwise recovery at each step of the purification process. Vector genomes were quantified via qPCR from aliquots of the sample at each process step and represented as normalized to the lysate.

                "An increased demand in AAV research has led to the need to develop more versatile purification methods. Affinity chromatography has been considered a possible solution, but its application to AAV purification has been hampered by the lack of resins or processes that can purify multiple AAV serotypes efficiently without individual optimization.10,11,12,13",
                "The main advantages of chromatographic purification are its scalability to larger volumes and reduced requirement for hands-on time, which considerably decreases costs and eases AAV manufacturing. Chromatographic resins can be scaled to high volumes, which enable input of unconcentrated large volumes of lysates. The process can also be automated and precisely controlled, monitored, and quantified, which eases troubleshooting and provides rich data about the quality of the run. For these reasons, chromatography-based methods have become the main workhorse for industrial production of biologics and small molecules.9 We find that AAVX affinity chromatography allows for purification of multiple AAV serotypes at multiple scales, is efficient, and results in vectors of comparable yield and bioactivity with ultracentrifugation purified vectors.",
                "A possible disadvantage of using an AAVX affinity chromatography (or any other type of affinity chromatography) is the possibility that new and uncharacterized capsids may not bind to the resin. It is indeed possible that AAV variants that have substantial changes at the AAVX antibody binding site may have low or no affinity to the resin. This can be a particular concern for purification of libraries of diverse AAV capsid variants, for which ultracentrifugation-based methods may be more suitable. For purification of single AAV serotypes, however, this concern can be tested either experimentally or by identifying whether any of the expected changes of the novel capsid alter the AAVX binding epitope once it is definitively mapped. Nevertheless, the majority of basic and clinical research so far has been conducted with AAV capsids that we have verified to bind to AAVX in this work.4 As such, an AAVX affinity chromatography-based process should be broadly useful for most researchers in the field.",
                "Another potential drawback of chromatographic purification is the co-purification of empty capsids. Indeed, several reports have described empty capsid co-purification to various degrees with affinity and other types of chromatography.12,13,27 In this study, we found the percentage of empty capsids in AAV9 and PHP.eB preps purified using AAVX affinity chromatography to be approximately 30%, compared with approximately 5% empty capsids in AAV9 preps purified using iodixanol ultracentrifugation (Figures\u00a04B and 4C), suggesting that HPLC purification did not enrich for full capsids to the extent of iodixanol ultracentrifugation, if at all. However, despite the higher level of empty capsids, AAVX purified preps showed equivalent bioactivity to iodixanol purified preps both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (Figures\u00a04D, 4E, and 5). Additionally, we have since carried out over 30 animal studies using AAVX-HPLC purified AAV and have observed satisfactory gene transfer in all of them (data not shown), indicating that the higher empty capsid content does not have an overt negative effect on efficacy.",
                "However, for applications where maximal reduction of empty capsid content is required, various upstream or downstream steps that reduce the production of empty capsids or enrich for full capsids can be added. These include: optimization of plasmid transfection ratios;28 use of vector plasmids that are full length or with minimal inverted terminal repeat (ITR) deletion;28 use of novel engineered ITRs; use of a transfection plasmid containing both the AAV cap and transgene in cis;28 or other methods which have been reported to reduce the fraction of empty capsids in the input lysate. While we did not explore this in the present work, multiple different downstream steps to enrich for full capsids utilizing size exclusion, anion exchange, or other chromatographic methods have been recently reported.10,11,13,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 These can be added in series as additional steps to the process after the AAVX affinity binding step.",
                "It should be noted that we estimated the empty capsid percentage in our preps using negative-stain TEM. Electron microscopy has the advantage of producing a clear visual of the AAV particle populations present, and when performed rigorously can match the results of analytical ultracentrifugation.36 While we performed the analysis based on published guidelines36 using two independent blinded operators, this method can nevertheless suffer from potential image noise, staining artifacts, or experimenter subjectivity at quantification.37 Therefore, future studies are needed to assess the impact of these methods on empty/full ratios of the yielded preparation including, e.g., analytical ultracentrifugation.",
                "Using AAVX, we aimed to develop an integrated purification process for preps of at least 1014 vg. We found the main bottlenecks to be efficient cell lysis in the upstream process, and the loss or sedimentation of AAV at the buffer exchange step in the downstream process. To mitigate these, we incorporated in situ cell lysis using detergents and nucleases in the upstream process and buffer exchange using Amicon Stirred Cell in the downstream process (see \u201can optimized purification protocol\u201d). These and other modifications increased process-wide efficiencies (from clarified lysate to purified preparation) to an average of approximately 75% while allowing resin re-use without loss of efficiency for at least six purification cycles (Figures\u00a03C and S3). Additionally, we observed consistently high binding efficiencies between different batches of AAVX resin (Figures\u00a02, S2, and S3) and consistently high overall purification efficiencies (Figures\u00a03C and 3D) across all serotypes tested. This indicates that batch-to-batch variability of AAVX is low and that the protocol is overall robust and reproducible.",
                "In summary, affinity chromatography with POROS CaptureSelect AAVX resin allows for high-efficiency purification of various AAV serotypes at multiple scales. The process developed here is primarily increased throughput and versatility applicable to laboratory studies. For clinical and/or scaled applications, further characterization on empty capsid content and elimination of the lysate clearance by centrifugation (e.g., by depth filtration or tangential-flow filtration) is needed. Here, we demonstrate the utility of AAVX in a cost- and time-effective process that does not require process modifications dependent on the serotype, thus being ideally suited for laboratory studies or centralized core facilities."

The preps were purified consecutively from prep 1 to prep 5, and the barcode region was PCR amplified in the elution fractions of the fifth preps. The amplicons were PCR amplified and submitted for Amplicon Seq at the MGH DNA Sequencing Core. Finally, the number of barcode reads corresponding to AAVs from each of the preps 2\u20135 was directly counted from the resulting FASTQ file. The vast majority of barcodes present came from the fifth preps (barcodes from previous preps were present at less than 0.1%)."
