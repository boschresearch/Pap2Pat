                        "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are small, non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses discovered in 1960s as contaminants of adenovirus preps1,2. They induce limited host response and are not associated with any known disease, yet were found to be highly efficient at delivering DNA cargo to many tissues in multiple animal species3. AAVs are thus widely used as a gene transfer tool in basic research and in translational and clinical gene therapy4. Their increased use has increased demand on AAV manufacturing both in terms of the quality of the preparation and the quantity of the material.",
                        "Currently, for research and for some clinical purposes, AAV purification often relies on an ultracentrifugation step on an iodixanol or cesium chloride gradient5,6. This process is appealing for two reasons; one, it is serotype agnostic and little process optimization is needed for the various AAV products researchers seek to purify, and second, it remains one of the more efficient methods of separation of genome-containing (or \u2018full\u2019) capsids from empty or partially filled capsids. The process step however is difficult to scale, requires precise manual handling and may co-purify any contaminants that have the same sedimentation co-efficient as AAV7.",
                        "Liquid chromatography provides a more scalable, less laborious, and possibly more efficient purification method, particularly under high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) conditions as has been shown for the purification of proteins and small molecules8. For AAV, several chromatographic methods have been developed, most using AVB Sepharose affinity, cation exchange or anion exchange chromatography9-12. While these methods demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of chromatographic purification of AAV, they also require substantial serotype-specific optimization and are thus not optimal for purification in a research setting, where many different serotypes need to be purified for different applications.",
                        "Recently, several AAV-binding resins have been commercially released, including AVB Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare) and POROS CaptureSelect AAV8, AAV9 and AAVX (Thermo Scientific). In the case of AVB, it was recently shown that affinity chromatography using AVB resin can efficiently purify AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6 and rh10 but requires serotype-specific optimization and fails to purify multiple other serotypes, including the broadly used AAV8 and AAV9 serotypes12,13. POROS CaptureSelect AAV8 and AAV9 resins bind and are recommended for purification of AAV8 and AAV9 respectively, but they are not compatible with other serotypes (POROS CaptureSelect product datasheet)10,12. POROS Captureselect AAVX is a resin consisting of a rigid 50 \u03bcm diameter crosslinked poly[styrene divinylbenzene] bead backbone, coated with cross-linked polyhydroxylated polymer, and linked to a camelid heavy-chain-only single-domain antibody fragment. The camelid antibody was raised against a conserved region of the AAV capsid, and the AAVX resin is marketed as a pan-AAV affinity resin capable of binding multiple different AAV serotypes (POROS CaptureSelect product datasheet)10. Nonetheless, there is still a need to develop a new single optimized process for highly efficient purification of a panel of highly divergent AAVs, including new engineered AAVs, which demonstrates an overall purification efficiency higher than other described methods, while still being simple to execute, low-cost, and minimally laborious."

                        "The adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) provides a safe and efficient gene therapy platform with a number of approved products with marked therapeutic impact for patients. However, a major bottleneck in its development and commercialization remains the efficiency, cost, and scalability of AAV production. Chromatographic methods have the potential to allow purification at increased scales and lower cost but often require optimization specific to each serotype. It was recently discovered that by combining multiple innovations into a single optimized chromatography purification process, a panel of highly divergent AAVs could be purified with an overall efficiency higher than other described methods. Furthermore, AAVs purified utilizing this highly efficient, optimized chromatography purification process resulted in purified AAVs which demonstrate similar in vitro and in vivo bioactivity to AAVs purified using ultracentrifugation-based processes.",

                        "In other embodiments, a direction of flow of the elution acidic buffer solution in an elution step is opposite to a direction of flow of the cell lysate through the chromatography resin medium in the contacting step, whereby an increased quantity of AAV particles are eluted from the chromatography resin medium compared to when the directions of flow in the elution and providing steps are the same. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that when the cell lysate is contacted in a first flow direction with chromatography resin medium that has been packed into a column, AAV particles in the cell lysate will bind quickly to the chromatography resin medium very close to the point of introduction of the cell lysate. Thus, it follows that if an elution buffer is introduced in the introduction point with the same direction of flow, AAV particles may rebind to the column before they can be eluted. On the contrary, when the elution buffer is introduced at a point distal to the cell lysate introduction point and an opposite direction of flow of the elution buffer is utilized, AAV particles released from the chromatography resin will encounter far less volume of chromatography resin medium, resulting in more AAV particle eluting during this step.",

                                "On a small scale, a panel of AAV serotypes were tested to determine whether and which serotypes POROS CaptureSelect AAVX (subsequently denoted as AAVX) can bind. To this end, AAV serotypes AAV2, AAV2_HSPG, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6.2, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, rh10, rh32.33, PHP.B, Anc80 and AAV7m81,14-23 were produced at a small scale. Crude lysates were incubated with the AAVX resin in a static binding assay (FIG. 1A). The results of these binding assays demonstrate that POROS AAVX can bind all of the tested serotypes with relatively high efficiency. Recovery was >95% for all serotypes except Anc80, which showed around 80% recovery. Thus, AAVX appears versatile in supporting chromatographic binding of multiple different serotypes.",

                                "Next, we aimed to determine whether AAVs could be purified with the AAVX resin via HPLC at the larger, hyperflask scale (cell growth surface area of 1720 cm2) from a volume of 560 mL, AAV2 and Anc80 preps based on a single hyperflask were purified on AAVX using HPLC. In short, the production and purification process consisted of triple transfection of adherent HEK293 cells, harvest and high salt lysis 3 days post-transfection, clarification of lysate by centrifugation and filtration, AAVX affinity chromatography at room temperature, 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter sterilization followed by a final buffer exchange and concentration step using 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off filtration (Amicon Ultracel 15). Recovery in each of the different chromatography fractions was quantified by qPCR for DNAse-resistant vector genomes (FIG. 1B, FIG. 6). Results from these experiments indicated that the majority of input virus is found in the elution fraction, with only a minor fraction of virus lost in the flow-through or TBS and ethanol washes. Repeated preps indicated that combined average purification efficiency for both AAV2 and Anc80 without serotype-specific optimization is around 50% (FIG. 1C). The average yield of AAV2 and Anc80 from this initial process was 1013 vector genomes (vg) of AAV per hyperflask, which was maintained for the more sequence divergent serotypes AAV9 and PHP.eB (FIG. 1D).",
                                "AAVX can be Regenerated for Re-Use without Loss of Efficiency or Carryover Contamination",
                                "Next, we aimed to determine whether HPLC with AAVX can also be used to purify small-scale preps, and whether resin can be re-used multiple times without contamination or loss of efficiency. Re-using resin is of interest because it decreases the cost and labour associated with AAV purification, and allows automatic back-to-back purification of multiple preps. We produced five different AAV1 preps at small scale, whereby the vectors of the 2nd to 5th AAV1 prep were identical except for a unique 100 bp DNA barcode region. We purified the preps consecutively from prep 1 to prep 5 using the same batch of resin, which was regenerated using 6M guanidine and TBS and 20% ethanol washes between runs. We then quantified the viral vector genomes in the input lysate, the flow-through and final elution via qPCR (FIG. 2A). Throughout the experiment, most of the input virus was found in the elution fraction (<2% found in flow-through) and there was no detectable loss of purification efficiency (FIG. 2B). Furthermore, NGS sequencing of the barcode region in the 5th prep showed that the majority (99.93%) of genomes found in the elution fraction came from the correct 5th prep, not preps 2-4. This indicates that resin can be re-used multiple times without significant loss of efficiency or carryover contamination.",
                                "Using the same method as above, we also asked whether the addition of Pluronic F-68 to HPLC buffers increases purification efficiencies. Pluronic F-68 is a surfactant that has been shown to decrease AAV binding to surfaces including plasticware24,25. As HPLC contains long and narrow plastic tubing, we reasoned that addition of Pluronic F-68 may increase purification efficiency by reducing AAV binding to plastic. To test this hypothesis, we added Pluronic F-68 to HPLC buffers to the concentration of 0.1% vol/vol and repeated the experiment described in FIG. 2A (see Fig. S2A). The results indicate that Pluronic F-68 did not increase elution efficiencies for AAV1, although it showed a trend towards increased efficiencies at the post-elution purification steps (Fig. S2B-C) and did not increase carry-over contamination (Fig. S2D-E). This indicates that Pluronic F-68 is a safe addition to HPLC buffers and may be considered for serotypes that are known to be strongly affected by binding to plastic.",
                                "**Purification Efficiency is Temperature-Dependent**",
                                "We also aimed to determine whether purification is affected by temperature, as HPLC machines are commonly housed and run at 4\u00b0 C. or 10\u00b0 C. to improve protein stability. We found that decreasing temperature from room temperature (24\u00b0 C.) to 10\u00b0 C. increases the fraction of input AAV in the flow-through from less than 5% to 40%-50% for AAV9 and PHP.eB (FIG. 2D). Because the major reason to perform purifications at cold temperatures is to increase AAV stability, we tested whether storage of AAV in clarified lysate at room temperature decreases subsequent AAV titers. qPCR titration of the resulting preps indicates that titers are maintained up to at least 4 days at room temperature, well beyond the average timeline of purification (FIG. 2E). These results indicate that decreasing purification temperature does not improve AAV stability but may result in decreased purification efficiencies.",
                                "**An Optimized Purification Protocol**",
                                "Next, we asked whether AAVX affinity chromatographic purification of AAV can be scaled to higher amounts of input virus (1014 vg or above). Our initial experiments demonstrated that this was feasible, however those results also indicated that applying for large scale purification the same process as that used for lower amounts of input virus (FIG. 2A) produced unacceptable losses at various steps, particularly at the filter sterilization and buffer exchange steps (not shown). We therefore aimed to systematically reduce vector loss at every step of the process, with the goal of producing a high efficiency protocol independent of the serotype purified. This resulted in a process with the following components (see Supplementary Protocol 1 for process details):",
                                "1) In situ lysis using detergents and nucleases. Based on the protocol described by Florencio et al26 and our own observations, in situ lysis using detergents and nucleases is as efficient as separate lysis of the cell pellet, and may be more efficient than in situ lysis using hypertonic salt. To obtain one-step lysis and DNAse removal, we add RNAseA (4.4 \u03bcg/ml), Turbonuclease (2.5 U/mL), Triton-X (0.5% vol/vol) and Pluronic F-68 (0.001% vol/vol) to the hyperflask and incubate for 1 hour at 150 rpm shaking, 37\u00b0 C. to aid lysis with mechanical forces (see Supplementary Protocol 1 for details). Here, Triton-X and RNAseA act as primary lysis agents, Turbonuclease acts to degrade plasmid DNA, while Pluronic F-68 serves to decrease potential AAV binding to plastics.",
                                "2) Addition of Pluronic F-68 to all buffers. Based on our observation that the addition of Pluronic F-68 does not reduce HPLC purification efficiencies (Fig. S2), and based on multiple anecdotal sources indicating that the coating of plastic and/or filter surfaces with surfactants may reduce protein binding, we add Pluronic F-68 at 0.01% vol/vol concentration to the elution buffer and incubate all plasticware that comes into contact with AAV with a Pluronic F-68 containing solution (FFB: 1\u00d7PBS, 172 mM NaCl, 0.001% Pluronic F-68) for approximately 15 min at room temperature. Additionally, pipette tips and serological pipettes are also coated prior to handling AAV.",
                                "3) Stringent resin cleaning with 0.1M phosphoric acid and 6M guanidine. While we observed no loss in AAV binding efficiencies with resin re-use at small scales with AAV1 (FIG. 2, S2), we did observe some loss of binding efficiencies with re-use at large scales, particularly for PHP.eB (data not shown). Based on the recommendations of the AAVX manufacturers (Alejandro Becerra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, personal communication), we increased resin cleaning stringency from 5 minutes with 6M guanidine alone to 15 minutes with pH 10.1M phosphoric acid followed by 15 minutes 6M guanidine HCl. These changes restored efficient resin binding up to at least 6 resin re-uses for both AAV9 and PHP.eB (Fig. S3A,B) with no increase in AAV in flow-through observed (Fig. S3C).",
                                "4) Careful buffer exchange. Our analysis indicated substantial losses at the buffer exchange step (25%-50%\u2014not shown). This can be caused by AAV binding to plastic/filter surfaces or overconcentration on the filter surface during buffer exchange, leading to sedimentation of AAV. To mitigate loss of AAV due to binding, we pre-treated all filters/plasticware with Pluronic F-68 as described above. To reduce vector loss due to overconcentration and precipitation, we switched to Amicon Stirred Cell concentrators, which allow for use of higher volumes and continuous mixing during concentration. Alternatively, we use Amicon Ultracel 15 concentrators with frequent (every 2 minutes of centrifugation) mixing and washing of the filter and do not exceed approximately 2\u00d71013 vg of AAV per one concentrator.",
                                "The resulting process is summarized in FIG. 3A. qPCR analysis of the amount of AAV found in different fractions of the optimized process indicate high recovery efficiencies at every step, with an overall average purification efficiency of approximately 75% for AAV9 and approximately 65% for PHP.eB (FIG. 3B). This improved recovery is driven by a considerable increase in efficiency at the filter sterilization+buffer exchange steps compared to the non-optimized protocol (FIG. 3C) and leads to an increased overall purification efficiency (FIG. 3D). Using. This optimized protocol, we obtained an average yield of 2\u00d71013 vg per hyperflask across multiple different vectors (FIG. 3E; analysis includes some vectors with transgenes that have lower than average production yields). Analysis of AAV loss at each step indicates that less than 5% of AAV is lost to the flow-through or at the filter sterilization step, while 10% and 20% on average are lost at the buffer exchange and elution steps respectively (FIG. 9), indicating potential targets for future optimization.",
                                "**The Purity, Yield and Bioactivity of AAVX-HPLC Purified AAV is Comparable to Iodixanol Purified AAV**",
                                "To determine whether HPLC purified virus is qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to iodixanol ultracentrifugation purified virus, we compared HPLC purified virus and iodixanol purified virus on purity, empty capsid content, in vitro bioactivity and in vivo bioactivity. Analysis by gel electrophoresis indicates that HPLC purified preps are comparable to iodixanol purified preps and consist mainly of the expected VP1-VP3 bands, with little-to-no unspecific bands present (FIG. 4A, FIG. 10). Furthermore, in vitro infectivity assay of HEK 293 cells indicates that HPLC and iodixanol purified viruses are equally efficient at infecting cells in vitro (FIG. 4B). Negative stain transmission electron microscopy of the HPLC purified preps indicate an average of approximately 30% empty capsids (FIG. 4C, FIG. 11), whereas approximately 20% empty capsids are commonly reported for iodixanol ultracentrifugation purified AAV27 (also see Discussion).",
                                "Finally, we compared in vivo bioactivity of HPLC and iodixanol purified viruses. We injected a total of 1011 vector genomes of self-complementary AAV9 carrying a Cbh-EGFP expression cassette retro-orbitally into 6-week-old wild-type male C57BL/6J mice. We euthanized mice 4 weeks post-injection and assayed AAV DNA levels and biodistribution as well as GFP expression in liver, quadriceps and brain. Transgene DNA, RNA and protein levels did not significantly differ between AAVX-HPLC and iodixanol purified viruses for any tissues (FIG. 5A). To confirm this observation, we sectioned, stained and imaged livers of injected mice (FIG. 5B). Image analysis indicates that GFP mean fluorescence intensity does not differ significantly between animals injected with AAVX-HPLC and iodixanol purified viruses, and that viruses purified with both methods transduced almost 100% of liver cells (FIG. 5C-D and FIG. 12-13). Taken together, these data indicate that AAVX-HPLC purified AAV is comparable in purity and bioactivity to iodixanol ultracentrifugation purified AAV."

In short, the sample is diluted in water and adsorbed onto a glow-discharged carbon or formvar/carbon coated grid. Once the specimen has been adsorbed on to the film surface, the excess liquid is blotted off using a filter paper (Whatman #1) and the grid is floated on a small drop (\u02dc5 \u03bcl) of staining solution (most commonly 0.75% uranyl formate, 1% uranyl acetate or 1-2% PTA). After 20 seconds the excess stain is blotted off and the sample is air dried briefly before it is examined in the transmission electron microscope. At least two images were taken per prep at 30,000\u00d7 magnification, and at least 200 virions were counted manually per image by two researchers blinded to the identity of the image, and empty and full ratios averaged between resulting counts. Due to the difficulty in confidently differentiating full and partially filled capsids using electron micrographs, virions were counted as empty and full only based on the criteria described in 39. On the minority of cases where a virion could not be confidently assigned to either (<1% capsids) the virion was not counted. Similarly, virions were not counted in areas of images, with image noise, artefacts, clumping, or other effects that obscure a clear classification of the virion type.",

This\n    provides very helpful information in troubleshooting, allowing you\n    to determine your purification efficiency, acting as a sanity check\n    (i.e. the amount of purified AAV cannot be greater than the amount\n    of AAV in input lysate, accounting for the accuracy of your\n    qPCR/ddPCR titration) and in the case of low yields allows you to\n    pinpoint whether the failure was at transfection or purification.\n    HPLC purification and buffer exchange A full introduction into the\n    usage and theory of HPLC is out of the scope of this protocol. The\n    below is intended for users with basic training and capacity to\n    operate HPLC machines and is based on the Akta Pure 25 system using\n    pre-packed 1 mL AAVX columns. Regardless of the machine used, the\n    below parameters are critical for efficient purification:\n  - Purification is carried out at room temperature. Purification at\n    cold temperatures substantially decreases binding efficiencies of\n    the resin (FIG. **2**D). For this purpose, both the clarified lysate\n    containing AAV and the HPLC machine need to be brought to room\n    temperature prior to purification.  \n    If the HPLC machine is housed in a fridge, we recommend not running\n    the machine inside the fridge with cooling turned off and a closed\n    door, since this can cause considerable increase of the temperature\n    inside the fridge. Instead, we recommend either 1) placing the\n    machine outside the fridge, 2) running the machine with fridge\n    turned off and door left open or 3) hooking the fridge up to an\n    external temperature controller (such as BN-LINK Digital Cooling\n    Thermostat Controller, Amazon) and setting the set-point to 22\u00b0 C.\n    to 24\u00b0 C.\n  - AAVX resin binding capacity is not exceeded. Thermo Fisher indicates\n    a binding capacity of up to 1\u00d71014 vg/ml which varies between\n    serotypes. A safe rule of thumb is to use 1 mL of resin per 1-2\n    hyperflasks, depending on the yield. When pooling AAV from multiple\n    hyperflasks, we recommend packing your own columns with AAVX resin\n    at a higher volume.\n  - Lysate application speed does not exceed 1 mL/min for a 1 mL\n    resin\u2014i.e. the residence time is no less than 1 min. Resin dynamic\n    binding capacity decreases with increasing loading speed and may\n    result in more AAV in the flow-through. We recommend a 2 min\n    residence time, or 0.5 mL/min loading speed for a 1 mL resin for\n    maximum recovery.\n  - Elution is performed in up-flow. Elution in down-flow (or the same\n    flow direction as lysate application) results in approximately 20%\n    less AAV in the elution. This is most likely because a majority of\n    AAV binds close to the inlet on the resin; therefore eluting in the\n    opposite direction avoids AAV rebinding of the resin at the elution\n    step.\n  - Elution pH is less than 2.9, with pH 2-2.5 optimal. AAV is acid\n    stable at below pH 3 and will not elute above pH 2.9. Some serotypes\n    can have strong binding affinities to the resin (such as AAV9 to the\n    POROS AAV9 resin) and decreasing pH down to pH 2 can help increase\n    recovery for such serotypes (Thermo Fisher\u2014personal communication).\n  - Resin regeneration is carried out with at least 15 min of 0.1M pH1\n    Phosphoric acid, followed by at least 15 min of 6M Guanidine. While\n    not a concern with small-scale preps, at large scale preps (3\u00d71013 .\n    . . 2\u00d71014) we commonly observed decreased binding efficiencies with\n    resin re-use when 10 min of 6M  \n    Guanidine only was used, particularly for PHP.eB. The AAVX resin is\n    highly acid stable, and increasing regeneration to 15 min of 0.1M\n    pH1 Phosphoric acid, followed 15 min of 6M Guanidine restored\n    binding efficiencies at large scales for at least 6 runs (Fig.\n    S**3**).\n  - The AAVX resin is NOT stable in high pH solutions. Accidental\n    treatment of the resin with 0.1M NaOH will destroy the resin.",

We recommend doing the\n      calculation before-hand to pick up elution fractions soon after\n      the run is done.\n    - We recommend staying with the machine for the first 10-15 minutes\n      in every new run to ensure that no leaks are present, that the\n      sample inlet contains no air bubbles (which can cause pre-mature\n      termination of loading, see Troubleshooting), and that sample\n      application reaches a steady plateau.\n    - See Troubleshooting for examples of successful and unsuccessful\n      runs\n  - After the run is complete, remove the elution fractions containing\n    AAV, store them at 4\u00b0 C. for short term or \u221220\u00b0 C. for long term.\n  - Multiple preps can be automatically purified back-to-back by copying\n    the protocol, changing sample input to S**2** . . . S**7**, saving\n    the new protocols, and starting them during the run of the first\n    protocol. This adds them to the run cue, and the machine will\n    automatically continue to these protocols after the previous ones\n    are complete.\n    - Note that purification of multiple preps back-to-back removes the\n      ability to collect flowthrough with the Outlet tube, as the\n      machine unfortunately contains only a single outlet line.\n    - In this case, place the Outlet tube into waste bin to avoid\n      overflowing the collection bottle.\n  - After the last run, Remove the AAVX column, cap the tubes and store\n    it at 4\u00b0 C.\n  - When the machine will not be expected to be used for longer than a\n    week, perform System CIP (cleaning in place):\n    - Place all inlets used in the run into 1 L 0.1M NaOH\n    - Start the System CIP protocol or manually run 20 mL liquid through\n      all lines\n    - Repeat for H\u2082O and 20% ethanol\n    - Store all lines in 20% ethanol",

Turning off nitrogen flow does not immediately eliminate\n      pressure from the manifold!

The filtration should take 5 minutes or more to\n      completion. Rapid filtration results in high local densities of\n      AAV on the filter surface, which leads to AAV aggregate formation\n      and subsequent loss of titer and/or bioactivity. The stirring\n      action by magnetic stir bar mitigates this substantially but would\n      be reduced by very rapid filtration.\n    - Filtration speed is proportional to the concentration of AAV (and\n      other molecules above 100 kDA). Thus, more concentrated preps will\n      require longer time to filter\u2014up to 15-20 minutes in our hands.\n  - Stop the filtration once 2-5 mL of liquid is left.\n    - Turn off the nitrogen gas, then slowly and gently lift the blue\n      valve to de-pressurize\n    - NB. Do not allow filtration to proceed to overconcentration at\n      this step\u2014this can cause AAV sedimentation and loss. Always aim to\n      stop the filtration before 1 mL of liquid is left.\n  - Remove the Amicon cap, pour in Final Formulation Buffer to 50 mL,\n    repeat filtration\n  - Repeat filtration until a total of \\>1000\u00d7 dilution is achieved.\n    This normally takes 2-3 filtration cycles.\n    - When leaving 5 mL of filtrate left, adding 45 mL of Final\n      Formulation buffer results in 10\u00d7 dilution. In this case 1000\u00d7\n      dilution is achieved in three cycles.\n    - This can also be achieved in two steps if starting with \\<5 mL of\n      volume of elution fractions (approximately 10\u00d7 dilution at the\n      filtration step) and repeating the buffer exchange twice with\n      \\>10\u00d7 dilution.\n  - At the last filtration cycle, to obtain an accurate desired volume\n    of final AAV, carefully observe the liquid level and stop and\n    de-pressurize the system at 5 mL.\n  - Stop the stirrer and estimate liquid volume by eye or by measuring\n    with a serological pipette.\n  - Remove the waste tube (keeping the tube connector attached to the\n    manifold) and place a 5 mL tube underneath the waste outlet.\n  - Continue filtration to the desired amount with stir bar turned on\n    low, by estimating remaining volume in the Amicon manifold through\n    observing the volume of waste in the 5 mL tube.\n    - This is required because the Amicon manifold is flat and accurate\n      volume estimations at less than 2 mL are difficult. By estimating\n      starting volume and volume in waste, an accurate estimation of\n      volume left in the Amicon manifold can be made.\n    - Removal of the waste tube is necessary because it contributes to\n      dead volume (approximately 2 mL), which can be filled with air to\n      various degree, making accurate waste volume estimation difficult.\n  - Alternatively, achieve desired final AAV volume by stopping the\n    filtration at various points and measuring left-over volume with a\n    pipette or serological.\n  - The solution can accurately be concentrated to a few hundred\n    microliters this way. However, we recommend keeping AAV at the\n    highest possible volume allowed by downstream experimental\n    requirements, particularly for PHP.B and its derivatives, as high\n    concentrations of AAV will aggregate more readily during freeze-thaw\n    cycles (Wright J F et al. Mol Ther. 2005 July; 12(1):171-8.).\n  - Depressurize Amicon, remove stir bar and aspirate AAV into a new 1.5\n    mL or 2 mL tube.\n    - Optionally wash the filter membrane with additional 100 \u03bcL of\n      Final Formulation Buffer and add to AAV.\n  - Measure the volume of final AAV solution with a P1000 pipette or\n    serological.\n    - For P1000, turn the pipette down to low volume, aspirate, then\n      turn the pipette to higher volumes while the tip is submerged in\n      the solution. When the solution is fully aspirated this way, the\n      volume can be read from the pipette.\n  - Record the volume or bring up to a desired volume with Final\n    Formulation Buffer.\n  - Take and store a 15 \u03bcl aliquot for titration\n    - Take a higher volume if further tests, such as protein\n      electrophoresis are performed.\n    - This is to avoid unnecessarily thawing AAV designated for\n      experimental applications.\n    - Do not open AAV tubes meant for experimental applications under\n      non-sterile conditions.\n  - Aliquot AAV into separate smaller aliquots unless the full amount is\n    expected to be used in a single experiment.\n  - Store AAV and the titration aliquot (if not immediately used for\n    titration) at \u221280\u00b0 C.\n  - Decontaminate and clean the Amicon manifold between concentration of\n    different AAV preps, and at the end:\n    - Disconnect the Amicon manifold from the nitrogen source\n    - Disassemble the manifold, and place all parts into a 2 L beaker\n      filled with 500 mL of 5% hydrogen peroxide\n    - Incubate with slight shaking for 5 minutes\n    - Repeat with 70% ethanol and Final Formulation Buffer\n    - Dry before storage or concentration of a new prep\n    - Alternatively, based on manufacturer's datasheet, Amicon Stirred\n      Cells are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures or can\n      be autoclaved for at least 10 cycles at 121\u00b0 C., 1 bar (250\u00b0 F.,\n      15 psi) for 30 minutes.  \n      Protocol for buffer exchange using Amicon Ultra 15 Centrifuge\n      devices\n  - NB.

Mol Ther. 2005 July;\n      12(1):171-8.).\n  - Measure the volume of final AAV solution with a P1000 pipette or\n    serological.\n    - For P1000, turn the pipette down to low volume, aspirate, then\n      turn the pipette to higher volumes while the tip is submerged in\n      the solution. When the solution is fully aspirated this way, the\n      volume can be read from the pipette.\n  - Record the volume or bring up to a desired volume with Final\n    Formulation Buffer.\n  - Take and store a 15 \u03bcl aliquot for titration.\n    - Take a higher volume if further tests, such as protein\n      electrophoresis are performed.\n    - This is to avoid unnecessarily thawing AAV designated for\n      experimental applications.\n    - Do not open AAV tubes meant for experimental applications under\n      non-sterile conditions.\n  - Aliquot AAV into separate smaller aliquots unless the full amount is\n    expected to be used in a single experiment.\n  - Freeze at \u221280 C.",

When the plasmid prep contains a high percent of mutated\n    ITRs, yields are substantially reduced (up to 10-fold or more) and\n    empty capsid percentage is increased. We recommend against use of\n    such AAV preps to maintain experimental consistency and always\n    checking for ITR integrity with SmaI/XmaI digests and/or next\n    generation sequencing. For this reason, if it is known that a\n    transgene will be extensively used in experimental studies, we\n    recommend producing a Mega or Giga scale DNA prep, validating the\n    integrity of the ITRs of this prep, aliquoting and using it for all\n    subsequent AAV production runs.\n  - Was the detergent and nuclease lysis performed correctly (containing\n    all components, and not for longer than 2 hours)?  \n    High amounts of AAV in the flow-through and other HPLC purification\n    issues\n  - Was purification carried out at room temperature?\n  - Was the sample brough to room temperature prior to purification?\n  - Was the resin/column new?\n  - Was the AAVX resin not allowed to dry out during storage?\n  - If not, was the resin/column previously regenerated with \\>15 min\n    pH1 Phosphoric acid and \\>15 min",
