    "title": "Identification of a PA-Binding Peptide with Inhibitory Activity against Influenza A and B Virus Replication",
    "date": "2009-10-20",
    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for new drugs against influenza type A and B viruses due to incomplete protection by vaccines and the emergence of resistance to current antivirals. The influenza virus polymerase complex, consisting of the PB1, PB2 and PA subunits, represents a promising target for the development of new drugs. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the protein-protein interaction domain between the PB1 and PA subunits of the polymerase complex of influenza A virus using a small peptide derived from the PA-binding domain of PB1. However, this influenza A virus-derived peptide did not affect influenza B virus polymerase activity. Here we report that the PA-binding domain of the polymerase subunit PB1 of influenza A and B viruses is highly conserved and that mutual amino acid exchange shows that they cannot be functionally exchanged with each other. Based on phylogenetic analysis and a novel biochemical ELISA-based screening approach, we were able to identify an influenza A-derived peptide with a single influenza B-specific amino acid substitution which efficiently binds to PA of both virus types. This dual-binding peptide blocked the viral polymerase activity and growth of both virus types. Our findings provide proof of principle that protein-protein interaction inhibitors can be generated against influenza A and B viruses. Furthermore, this dual-binding peptide, combined with our novel screening method, is a promising platform to identify new antiviral lead compounds.",

                "Influenza A and B viruses are closely related RNA viruses, which cause respiratory disease in humans and other animals. Both viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviruses, a family of enveloped, negative-sense RNA viruses that encode their genetic information in eight segments. While influenza A viruses (FluA) infect a broad variety of animals as well as humans, influenza B viruses (FluB) are predominantly found in humans [1]. Recently, FluA viruses have attracted the world's attention due to their ability to cause global pandemics, such as the 1918 \u201cSpanish\u201d flu or the novel H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin [2], [3], [4]. However, both FluA and FluB viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics, which result in hundreds of thousands of deaths each year, since FluB can cause the same spectrum of symptoms that is observed with FluA [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In most years, only one type causes the majority of the cases, leading to the exclusion of the others [1]. For this reason, the annual influenza vaccination recommended by the WHO contains both FluA and FluB strains (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/vaccinerecommendations1/en/). Thus, both types A and B viruses pose a large threat to public health.",
                "Since the current vaccines against influenza viruses offer only incomplete protection, antivirals are greatly needed. Presently, the only class of anti-influenza drugs available which are active against both FluA and FluB are neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) [10]. However, many influenza A strains, including the circulating H1N1 strains in Europe and the US, are already resistant to oseltamivir [11], [12], suggesting a limited range of use for this type of drug. The resistance is not restricted to FluA, since the emergence of FluB viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors is known [13], [14]. In addition, the treatment of influenza B, particularly in young children, is associated with delayed antiviral effects and clinical resolution [15]. This might be related to the observation that oseltamivir carboxylate, the active metabolite of oseltamivir, is less active against the FluB rather than the FluA virus neuraminidase [13]. Other approved antivirals that target the viral M2 protein, such as amantadine, are only effective against FluA strains, since FluB strains lack a comparable M2 protein [16]. Additionally, the high prevalence of resistance to M2 inhibitors and the general rapid appearance of resistant strains during treatment restricts the therapeutic potential of this class of antiviral drugs [17].",
                "Influenza virus replication and transcription is performed in the nucleus by the heterotrimeric viral polymerase complex consisting of the PB1, PB2, and PA subunits. This includes the synthesis of the genomic RNA from an intermediate copy RNA and the synthesis of viral mRNA transcripts. Synthesis of the latter transcripts is dependent on 8\u201315 nt long primers derived from the 5\u2032ends of capped endogenous mRNAs. PB1 possesses the RNA polymerization activity, whereas PB2 is known to bind capped mRNA [18], [19], [20]. Recently, RNAse activity could be identified in the N-terminal part of PA, which is most likely necessary to cleave the primer off the remaining host mRNA [21], [22]. The structure of the trimeric complex at the atomic level is not yet resolved, but cryo-EM studies do exist [23], [24]. Recent crystal structures have shown that PB1 binds to PA via a 310-helix at its N-terminus comprised of amino acids (aa) 5\u201311 [25], [26]. This finding is compatible with previous observations that the PA-binding site is localized to the extreme N-terminus of PB1 [27], [28]. Since the association of these subunits is essential for viral replication [28], [29], [30], [31], and since the sequence of this domain of PB1 is highly conserved among FluA strains [32], this interaction presents an attractive target for antiviral drugs. We have previously shown that a peptide derived from the first 25 amino acids of FluA PB1 can inhibit both the polymerase activity and viral spread of FluA but not FluB [32]. Here, we identify a chimeric FluA/FluB peptide which is active against both virus types."

                        "Previously, we have shown that the N-terminal 25 aa of FluA PB1 (PB11\u201325A) are sufficient to bind FluA-PA and inhibit the polymerase activity of FluA [32]. However, this sequence was not able to block the polymerase activity of FluB. Since the first 25 aa of FluA-PA and FluB-PA differ at 8 positions (Fig. 1A), the failure to block FluB polymerase activity might be due to impaired binding of PB11\u201325A to FluB PA. Alternatively, the PA-binding domain of FluB PB1 might extend beyond the extreme 25 amino acids. To test this, we generated FluA/B PB1 chimeras by substituting N-terminal regions of varying length from FluA-PB1 into FluB-PB1 (Fig. 1B). After transient co-expression in human 293T cells, we then used immunoprecipitation assays to test which of these chimeras could bind to FluA-PA. All PB1 chimeras tested, including a chimera containing only the first 25 aa of FluA-PB1, could bind FluA-PA equally, whereas wild-type FluB-PB1 could not (Fig. 1C). This implied that the few aa differences in this small domain are the major determinant in PB1 for the type-specific binding of PB1 to PA."

For this purpose, we immobilized biotinylated peptides corresponding to PB11\u201325 on streptavidin-coated plates and subsequently added cell lysates containing HA-tagged PA. Bound PA was detected using HA-specific primary and peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. To determine the binding efficiency of variant peptides we performed the ELISA in a competitive manner. In this case, non-biotinylated competitor peptides were added simultaneously with HA-tagged PA to wells containing immobilized PB11\u201325 peptide.",
                        "The core-binding site of the PA-binding domain of FluA-PB1 was recently determined by co-crystalization with the C-terminus of PA and is comprised of a 310-helix ranging from aa 5\u201311 [25]. We therefore first evaluated our FluA-binding assay by using a soluble wild-type PB11\u201325A peptide, which resulted in a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.8 nM (Fig. 2A). A \u201cscrambled peptide\u201d harboring the same amino acid composition as PB11\u201325A but with the order randomized, did not block PA-HA binding at highest concentrations (3000 nM, data not shown). Next, the minimal binding domain was determined by deleting aa from the N- and/or C-terminus of PB11-25A. Determination of the IC50 using the truncated competitor peptides demonstrated that the 3-10 helix is absolutely essential for binding to PA, since any truncation of this sequence resulted in no competition (Fig. 2B). This is congruent with the results obtained by mutational analysis of the PA-binding domain [28]. Residual competition from partially C- or N-truncated peptides was observed, implying that some of the aa positions flanking the 3\u201310 helix may be dispensable for binding. Specifically, truncating the C-terminal 10 aa of FluA PB11\u201325A resulted in an IC50 of 43.3 nM compared to 1.8 nM for the full-length peptide (Fig. 2B). Since this truncated peptide can efficiently bind to PA, yet still contains many of the differing aa positions between FluA and FluB, we chose this sequence as a basis to test variant peptides for their binding to both FluA- and FluB-PA."

                        "As the PB11\u201315 sequence differs by 8 aa between FluA and FluB (Fig. 1A), we decided to create chimeras containing combinations of FluA- and FluB-specific residues and test these 15mer peptides in the competitive ELISA using both FluA-PA and FluB-PA. For this assay, biotinylated PB11\u201325A was used in combination with FluA-PA-HA, biotinylated PB11\u201325B was combined with FluB-PA-HA, and the competitor peptides were tested with both combinations. Competitor peptides PB11\u201315A and PB11\u201315B, derived from the wild-type sequences, competed only for FluA PA or FluB PA, respectively, with no cross-type competition detectable (Fig. 3). We then tested competitor peptides containing combinations of FluB-specific aa in the PB11\u201315A background. While most of these combinations showed no affinity for FluB, substituting positions 6 and 7 led to a significantly reduced IC50 for FluB-PA as well as a slight decrease in the IC50 for FluA-PA, suggesting that this peptide could bind to both proteins. By substituting only the FluB-specific tyrosine at position 6, efficient binding to PA of both types resulted. In contrast, changing only position 7 of a FluA- to a FluB-specific sequence ablated binding to PA of both types. Introduction of a phenylalanine or tryptophan at position 6 demonstrated that related residues can significantly increase the binding affinity to FluA PA, but only partially increase the affinity to FluB PA. A histidine or cysteine at position 6 led to peptides failing to bind to FluB PA, while binding to FluA PA was still possible, indicating that not all amino acid substitutions confer the dual-binding activity observed with tyrosine at this position.",
                        "To further confirm that tyrosine at position 6 of FluA PB1 can bind directly to both FluA- and FluB-PA, we used a biotinylated 25mer peptide PB11\u201325AT6Y as well as wild-type peptides and cell lysates containing overexpressed PA-HA derived from several different FluA and FluB strains in the ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4A\u2013C, PA-HA from several FluA strains of various subtypes, including a human H5N1 isolate, bound to both PB11\u201325A and PB11\u201325 AT6Y, but not to PB11\u201325B or a scrambled biotinylated peptide. Conversely, PA-HA derived from several different FluB strains bound to both the PB11\u201325B and PB11\u201325AT6Y (Fig. 4D). Thus, a FluA-PB1-derived sequence containing a single substitution at position 6 can directly bind to PA from different FluA and FluB viruses. Molecular modeling suggests that the FluB-derived tyrosine at position 6 of PB11\u201325AT6Y fits into a hydrophobic pocket of FluA PA and displaces a water molecule (Fig. 3F). Both the increased hydrophobic interaction as well as the entropic effect of the water displacement might explain the enhanced binding of PB1-T6Y to PA of FluA and possibly of FluB."

This confirmed that PB11\u201325 derived from FluA or FluB can only bind to FluA-PA or FluB-PA, respectively. However, PB11\u201325AT6Y could be immunoprecipitated with either FluA-PA or FluB-PA.",
                        "Next, we tested the ability of these fusion proteins to inhibit the polymerase activity of both FluA and FluB using a reconstituted viral ribonucleoprotein complex and a reporter gene. As previously shown [32], PB11\u201325A-GFP inhibits the activity of FluA, but not FluB, while the converse is true of PB11\u201325B-GFP (Fig. 5C). However, PB11\u201325AT6Y-GFP inhibited both FluA and FluB polymerase activity to comparable levels as the wild-type-derived sequences (Fig. 5C), indicating that this variant peptide is also biologically active.",
                        "Finally, we tested the ability of these peptides to inhibit viral spread in cell culture. MDCK cells were infected with either A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Thailand/1/2004 (H5N1), B/Yamagata/73, or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a specificity control from a different virus family. A plaque reduction assay was then performed in the presence of PB11\u201325A, PB11\u201325AT6Y, or a negative-control peptide fused to an HIV-Tat derived sequence [33] (Table 1) to allow the peptides to cross the plasma membrane. Similar experiments with a FluB-derived peptide were not possible due to its insolubility. The peptide containing the T6Y substitution inhibited the growth of all influenza strains tested, while PB11\u201325A-Tat only inhibited FluA (Fig 6). Thus, a single mutation in the PB11\u201325A sequence results in a peptide which is active against both FluA and FluB strains."

                "Here we report that the PA-binding domains of the polymerase subunits PB1 of influenza A and B viruses are highly conserved within each virus type, and that these domains are not mutually exchangeable. Based on phylogenetic analysis and a biochemical ELISA-based screening approach, we were able to identify a PB1-derived peptide of influenza A virus with a single influenza B-specific amino acid substitution which recognizes PA of both virus types. Significantly, this dual-binding peptide blocked both the polymerase activity and spread of both viruses and raises the exciting possibility of developing new antivirals that specifically interfere with the polymerase complex assembly of both viruses.",
                "The inability of PB11\u201325A to efficiently bind to FluB-PA and vice versa strongly indicates that these PA-binding domains show limited functional compatibility between the two virus types. We speculate that this incompatibility is caused by an independent evolution of the FluA and FluB polymerase proteins. This is in accordance with a virus-type specific conservation of the PA-binding domain of PB1 (Fig. 1) and further highlighted by an overall aa identity of the viral polymerase subunits of less than 35% between FluA and FluB strains. Together, these differences may account for the failure to reconstitute an active trimeric polymerase complex by mixing FluA and FluB polymerase subunits ([34], [35], [36], unpublished results). However, both FluA and FluB viruses have a common origin [1]. Thus, it is not unexpected that the aa residues of PA which are in close contact with PB11\u201325 are conserved between FluA and FluB [25], [26], indicating that the PA domain of both virus types bind PB1 in a similar fashion. This similarity might explain how one single amino acid substitution (T6Y) in PB11\u201325A is sufficient to allow binding to FluB-PA. Based on the available crystal structure of PA complexed with the N-terminus of PB1 and our modeling results with this dual-binding peptide PB11\u201325A6Y (Fig. 4F), we speculate that the tyrosine residue might exploit a hydrophobic pocket in the PB1-binding domain of FluB PA, thereby stabilizing the interaction. Such an occupation of a hydrophobic pocket may also be important to stabilize the interaction between PB11\u201325A6Y and FluB PA.",
                "Both the identification of the FluA- and FluB-PA-binding peptide PB11\u201325AT6Y and our novel ELISA-based screening assay provide a unique platform for future screening of small molecules targeting the PB1/PA interaction of both virus types. Such inhibitors represent attractive new tools to disrupt a variety of protein-protein interactions (PPI) [37], [38]. Initial attempts to identify PPI inhibitors were challenged by the large contact surfaces of protein-protein interfaces. However, the identification of a small subset of aa residues, such as the PA-binding domain of PB1 that contribute to most of the free energy of binding provide excellent targets. Recent screening approaches led to the identification of potent PPI inhibitors that block dimerization between the human protein double mutant 2 (HDM2) and a 15-residue a-helical region of the tumor suppressor p53 [39], the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) transcription factor Myc and Max [40] or the interaction between paxilin and the integrin a4 [41]. Proof-of-principle that viral protein interactions are also attractive targets for the generation of PPI inhibitors was first obtained with human papilloma virus [42] and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [43]. In the case of HSV-1, the interaction between the catalytic subunit of the HSV-1 polymerase (UL30) and its cofactor, the processivity factor UL42 was targeted. Similar to the interaction of PB1 and PA, the extreme 18 C-terminal residues of UL30 are sufficient to bind to UL42. Using a biochemical screening assay based on the specific interaction of this C-terminal peptide and UL42, several potent small molecule inhibitors were identified [43]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that PPI inhibitors that block the dimerization of PB1 and PA can also be identified using the newly established ELISA-based screening assay. Indeed, recent results indicate that this approach has the potential to identify PPI inhibitors that prevent viral polymerase activity and replication of both types of influenza viruses (Kessler et al., unpublished results). We believe that the PB1/PA interface is an excellent target for PPI inhibitors, because the PA-binding domain within the extreme N-terminus of PB1 is crucial for the interaction with PA, since PB1 mutants lacking this domain fail to interact with PA [28]. Using PB11\u201325A6Y and FluA PA for screening, we expect that some PPI inhibitors possess a high specificity against both influenza virus types. This is supported by our observations that PB11\u201325A6Y blocks the growth of FluA and FluB but not VSV.",
                "Besides the PA/PB1 complex, other targets of influenza viruses have become attractive for the development of PPI inhibitors, including the interaction interface between PB2 and PB1, for which the crystal structure was recently solved [44]. Additionally, based on the crystal structure of a fragment of PB2 bound to the cap analog m7GTP [20], non-PPI inhibitors might become feasible that compete with cap-binding properties of PB2. Furthermore, the cap-snatching endonuclease of influenza virus polymerase localized in the N-terminal domain of PA [21], [22] provides a further target for the development of effective inhibitors. However, it has yet to be shown whether these targets are suitable for the development of antivirals. Since the available information of these novel targets is restricted to FluA strains, it remains unclear whether such antivirals may also be active against FluB.",
                "Attempts to substitute position 6 of the FluA PB11\u201325A peptides with other residues than tyrosine did not result in improved FluB-PA binding in the competitive ELISA experiments. However, replacements with either phenylalanine or tryptophan residues enhanced binding to FluA-PA approximately 20 fold. This suggests that other substitutions may further enhance the binding affinity to FluA-PA and increases the antiviral activity of these peptides. In one study, random substitutions of single aa within an importin-alpha-binding peptide increased its affinity by several orders of magnitude [45], providing proof of principle that the development of potent peptide inhibitors from a peptide lead is possible. The antiviral activity of VIRIP, a peptide that blocks HIV-1 entry by interacting with the gp41 fusion peptide could be increased in its antiretroviral potency by two orders of magnitude [46]. Thus, random substitutions of the PA-binding domain may reveal peptides with significantly enhanced binding properties for FluA-PA. This approach might also lead to the identification of peptides, which bind PA of both virus types, using PB11\u201325A6Y as the lead peptide. Most importantly, such peptides would be prime candidates for the development of antiviral peptidomimetics."

The reporter activity was determined 24 h post transfection and normalized using the Dual-Glu\u00ae Lufierase Assay System (Promega). The activity observed with transfection reactions containing Flag-GFP were set to 100%."

                        "The solid-phase synthesis of the peptides, including the peptides for the plaque reduction assay (Table 1), was carried out on a Pioneer automatic peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) employing Fmoc chemistry with TBTU/diisopropylethyl amine activation. Side chain protections were as follows: Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr and Tyr: t-Bu; Asn, Gln and His: Trt; Arg: Pbf; Lys and Trp: Boc. Coupling time was 1 h. Double couplings were carried out if a difficult coupling was expected according to the program Peptide Companion (CoshiSoft/PeptiSearch, Tucson, USA). All peptides were generated as carboxyl amides by synthesis on Rapp S RAM resin (Rapp Polymere, T\u00fcbingen, Germany). Biotin was incorporated at the C-terminus of indicated peptides with Fmoc-Lys(Biotin)-OH (NovaBiochem/Merck, Nottingham, UK) and TBTU/diisopropylethyl amine activation for 18 h, followed by coupling of Fmoc-\u03b2-Ala-OH for 1 h. Peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected by a 3 h treatment with TFA containing 3% triisobutylsilane and 2% water (10 ml/g resin). After precipitation with t-butylmethyl ether, the resulting crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC (RP-18) with water/acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% TFA and characterized by analytical HPLC and MALDI-MS. Some peptides were synthesized by peptides&elephants (Nuthetal, Germany) and subsequently purified and characterized as described above."
