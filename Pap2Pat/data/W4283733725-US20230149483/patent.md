# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to methods of inhibiting horizontal plasmid gene transfer through bacterial conjugation to control the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in the gut environment.

## BACKGROUND

The spread of antibiotic resistance genes and the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria cause clinical failure of antibiotic treatments, thus threatening animal and public health. An estimated 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, and more than 35,000 people die. Thus, there is a growing need to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. The gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans harbors a vast number of microorganisms that could carry and transfer antibiotic resistance genes. The primary means for the spread of antibiotic resistance is by horizontal gene transfer, and conjugative plasmids are the principal vectors for the horizontal gene transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, leading to the rapid rise of antibiotic resistance in both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Failing to tackle multidrug resistance could result in 11 to 444 million deaths globally, and alternative treatments that do not rely on antibiotics are urgently needed.

## SUMMARY

Methods of inhibiting bacterial conjugation or horizontal gene transfer in the gut of a subject are provided. In certain embodiments, the methods comprise administering to the subject a composition comprising a probiotic bacterium and a prebiotic, wherein the probiotic bacterium produces at least one short chain fatty acid (SCFA) in the gut of the subject. In certain embodiments, the methods comprise administering to the subject a composition comprising at least one SCFA.

Compositions for inhibiting bacterial conjugation or horizontal gene transfer in the gut of a subject comprising at least one SCFA and/or a SCFA-producing probiotic bacterium are also provided.

While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the figures and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced by beneficial gut bacteria when they ferment dietary fiber in the gut of animals and humans. SCFAs are used for energy and as a regulator of the gastrointestinal tract's physiology, and further remodel the gut microbiota in favor of beneficial microbes. The inventors have surprisingly found that SCFAs, at gastrointestinal physiological levels, can inhibit the transfer of plasmids between bacteria.

So that the present disclosure may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which embodiments of the disclosure pertain. Many methods and materials similar, modified, or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the embodiments of the present disclosure without undue experimentation, the preferred materials and methods are described herein. In describing and claiming the embodiments of the present disclosure, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set out below.

It is to be understood that all terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting in any manner or scope. For example, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” can include plural referents unless the content clearly indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word “or” is intended to include “and” unless the context clearly indicate otherwise. The word “or” means any one member of a particular list and also includes any combination of members of that list. Further, all units, prefixes, and symbols may be denoted in its SI accepted form.

Numeric ranges recited within the specification are inclusive of the numbers defining the range and include each integer within the defined range. Throughout this disclosure, various aspects of this invention are presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible sub-ranges, fractions, and individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed sub-ranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and decimals and fractions, for example, 1.2, 3.8, 1½, and 4¾ This applies regardless of the breadth of the range.

The term “about”, as used herein, refers to variation in the numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through typical measuring techniques and equipment, with respect to any quantifiable variable, including, but not limited to, mass, volume, time, and temperature. Further, given solid and liquid handling procedures used in the real world, there is certain inadvertent error and variation that is likely through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of the ingredients used to make the compositions or carry out the methods and the like. The term “about” also encompasses these variations. Whether or not modified by the term “about,” the claims include equivalents to the quantities.

As used herein, the term “administering,” refers to the placement of a composition as disclosed herein into a subject by a method or route which results in at least partial delivery of the short chain fatty acid or short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria or at a desired site.

The term “bacterial conjugation” as used herein refers to the direct transfer of genetic material between at least two bacterial cells (also referred to as biological conjugation). Typically, bacterial conjugation requires cell-to-cell contact. The bacteria may be of the same species or of different species.

The term “bacterial horizontal gene transfer” as used herein refers to the direct transfer of genetic material between at least two bacterial cells, wherein the gene transfer is not via vertical transmission (i.e., is not the transmission of DNA from a parent to its offspring). Horizontal gene transfer is typically achieved by cell-to-cell contact (e.g., by bacterial conjugation). However, horizontal gene transfer may not involve cell-to-cell contact and may be achieved by transformation or by transduction.

As used herein, the terms “effective amount” refers to a dosage sufficient to inhibit bacterial conjugation or bacterial gene transfer. This can vary depending on the type of targeted bacteria, the subject to which the composition is administered, or the surface on which the bacteria reside. An effective amount can be determined by one of skill in the art especially in view of the disclosure provided below.

The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound agricultural and/or animal husbandry industry standards and/or medical/veterinary judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject with toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.

The term “subject” refers to any organism or animal subject that is an object of a method or material, including mammals, e.g., humans, laboratory animals (e.g., primates, rats, mice, rabbits), livestock (e.g., poultry, pigs, cows, sheep, and goats), household pets (e.g., dogs, cats, and rodents), and horses. Synonyms used herein include “patient” and “animal”.

The compositions of the present disclosure may comprise at least one short chain fatty acid. As used herein, the term “short chain fatty acid” or “SCFA” has its general meaning in the art and refers to aliphatic carboxylic acids composed of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched. Examples of short-chain fatty acids include: formic acid; acetic acid; propionic acid; butyric (butanoic) acid; isobutyric (2-methylbutanoic) acid; valeric (pentanoic) acid; isovaleric (3-methylbutanoic); and caproic (hexanoic) acid. In some embodiments, the SCFA is selected from saturated fatty acids comprising six or less carbon atoms, or five or less carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the SCFA is formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, or methylbutyric acid. In some embodiment, the SCFA is also a salt or an ester selected from formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, or methylbutyrate.

In certain embodiments, the composition of the disclosure has the SCFA or combination of SCFAs present in the amount of between about 0.01 wt-% and about 10 wt-%, between about 0.05 wt-% and about 5 wt-%, or between about 0.1 wt-% and about 2 wt-%. It is to be understood that all values and ranges between these values and ranges are encompassed by the present disclosure.

The compositions of the present disclosure may comprise a probiotic. As used herein the term “probiotic” is meant to designate live microorganisms which, they are integrated in a sufficient amount, exert a positive effect on health, comfort and wellness beyond traditional nutritional effects. In certain embodiments, the probiotic is a SCFA-producing bacteria.

Concerning the compositions of the disclosure, which may comprise different bacterial strains, any mixing ratio is possible. The mixing ratio is indicated in colony forming units (CFU), which are suitably determined prior to mixing the individual strains. The ratios of the strains may or may not be equal, such as 1:(0.1-10) for a composition comprising two strains, 1:(0.1-10):(0.1-10) for a composition comprising three strains, 1:(0.1-10):(0.1-10):(0.1-10) for a composition comprising four strains, and so forth. For example, the ratio in a composition comprising two strains may be from 1:2 to 2:1. In another embodiment, the ratios of the strains are roughly or substantially equal, such as 1:1 for a composition comprising two strains, 1:1:1 for a composition comprising three strains, 1:1:1:1 for a composition comprising four strains, and so forth. The composition can be prepared by mixing the respective bacterial amount (as determined by colony count) of each strain to be incorporated into the composition. The strains to be incorporated may be provided as stocks of individual strains, each one of them for example in the form of a lyophilizate. In the event that different stocks have different concentrations (CFU/g), appropriate amounts (g) of each one are used, so that the desired composition has the desired CFU of each of the strains.

The compositions of the present disclosure may comprise one or more prebiotics. Prebiotics are a category of functional food, defined as non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the intestines, e.g., ilea, duodenum, cecum, or colon, and thus improve host health. Prebiotics refer to food sources which can be metabolized by probiotics but are non-digestible or poorly digestible by an animal. Thus, following uptake by the animal, the non-digestible prebiotics can pass through the small intestine and enter the large intestine to stimulate the growth of the probiotics in this compartment. Prebiotics can thus serve as a food source for probiotics. Typically, prebiotics are carbohydrates (such as oligosaccharides). The most prevalent forms of prebiotics are nutritionally classed as soluble fiber. To some extent, many forms of dietary fiber exhibit some level of prebiotic effect.

Examples of suitable prebiotics include alginate, xanthan, pectin, locust bean gum (LBG), inulin, guar gum, galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS), fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), polydextrose (i.e. Litesse®), lactitol, lactosucrose, soybean oligosaccharides, isomaltulose (Palatinose™), isomalto-oligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, mannan-oligosaccharides, arabino-xylo oligosaccharides, beta-glucans, cellobiose, raffinose, gentiobiose, melibiose, xylobiose, cyclodextrins, isomaltose, trehalose, stachyose, panose, pullulan, verbascose, galactomannans, and all forms of resistant starches. In certain embodiments, the prebiotic comprises fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, mannan-oligosaccharides, or a combination thereof. Examples of dietary sources of prebiotics include soybeans, inulin sources (such as Jerusalem artichoke, jicama, and chicory root), raw oats, unrefined wheat, unrefined barley and yacon. Alternatively, prebiotics can be purified or chemically or enzymatically synthesized.

In certain embodiments, the composition of the disclosure has the prebiotic or combination of prebiotics present in the amount of between about 0.01 wt-% and about 25 wt-%, between about 0.05 wt-% and about 10 wt-%, or between about 0.1 wt-% and about 5 wt-%. It is to be understood that all values and ranges between these values and ranges are encompassed by the present disclosure.

While is it possible to administer the SCFA, the SCFA-producing probiotic bacteria, and/or the prebiotic alone (i.e. without any support, diluent or excipient), the compositions of the present disclosure may be administered on or in a support as part of a product, in particular as a component of a food product, an animal feed, a dietary supplement or a pharmaceutical formulation. These products typically contain additional components well known to those skilled in the art.

Any product which can benefit from the composition may be used. These include but are not limited to foods and pharmaceutical products. The term “food” is used in a broad sense—and covers food for humans as well as food for animals (i.e. a feed). In certain embodiments, the food is for human consumption. In certain embodiments, the composition may be used as, or in the preparation of, animal feeds, such as livestock feeds, in particular poultry (such as chicken) feed, or pet food. The food may be in the form of a solution or as a solid depending on the use and/or the mode of administration.

The present disclosure provides the use of the compositions of the disclosure in a method of inhibiting bacterial conjugation or horizontal gene transfer in the gut of a subject.

As used herein, the term “inhibiting” refers to preventing, arresting, or reducing the occurrence of bacterial conjugation or bacterial horizontal gene transfer.

In certain embodiments, inhibiting bacterial conjugation is by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or by 100% as compared to bacteria not treated by the composition comprising a SCFA and/or a SCFA-producing probiotic bacterium. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays can be used to assess inhibition of bacterial conjugation. In certain embodiments, assessing inhibition of bacterial conjugation is carried out by assessing the conjugation frequency, e.g., by calculating the ratio between the obtained transconjugant CFU and the number of bacterial donors that were used in the conjugation assay.

In certain embodiments, inhibiting bacterial horizontal gene transfer is by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or by 100% as compared to bacteria not treated by the composition comprising a SCFA and/or a SCFA-producing probiotic bacterium. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays can be used to assess inhibition of bacterial horizontal gene transfer. In certain embodiments, assessing inhibition of bacterial horizontal gene transfer is carried out by, e.g., PCR, southern blot, sequence composition methods or by homology methods.

In certain embodiments, the levels of SCFAs in the gut of a subject are increased by 10-fold to 10,000-fold following administration of the composition. In some embodiments, the levels of SCFAs are increased by 10-fold to 1,000-fold following administration of the composition. In some embodiments, the levels of SCFAs are increased by 2-fold to 100-fold following administration of the composition. In some embodiments, the levels of SCFAs are increased by 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 300-fold, 400-fold, 500-fold, 600-fold, 700-fold, 800-fold, 900-fold, 1,000-fold, 2,000-fold, 3,000-fold, 4,000-fold, 5,000-fold, 6,000-fold, 7,000-fold, 8,000-fold, 9,000-fold, or 1,000-fold following administration of the composition.

The main mechanism by which bacteria acquire resistance is by the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by bacterial conjugation and/or horizontal gene transfer (e.g., via plasmid transfer).

In certain embodiments, inhibiting bacterial conjugation or horizontal gene transfer blocks genetic transfer between bacteria including transfer of, for example, antibiotic resistant genes (e.g., tetA, ampC), adhesion factors (e.g., fimbria clusters), invasion factors (e.g., Type 3 secretion system), toxins (e.g., stx), metabolic genes (e.g., mal genes used for maltose metabolism), virulence factors (e.g., ybt), and tolerance to environmental stresses genes (e.g., mer genes). In certain embodiments, inhibiting bacterial conjugation or horizontal gene transfer blocks genetic transfer between bacteria including acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., those coding for multidrug resistance (MDR)). In certain embodiments, inhibiting bacterial conjugation blocks genetic transfer between bacteria including the transfer of plasmids.

By inhibiting bacterial conjugation and/or horizontal gene transfer, the compositions of the disclosure can be used to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors between bacteria by e.g., conjugation, and accordingly increase susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to treatment.

Thus, according to another embodiment there is provided a method of increasing susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotic treatment, the method comprising contacting the pathogenic bacteria with an effective amount of a composition of the disclosure, thereby increasing susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria to the antibiotic treatment.

In certain embodiments, the pathogenic bacteria are enteropathogenic bacteria. Exemplary enteropathogenic bacteria include, but are not limited to, Salmonella enterica (e.g., S. typhi and S. typhimurium), Shigella (S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae), Vibrio cholerae/parahaemolyticus, Escherichia (e.g., E. coli, E. coli 0157:H7), Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella spp., Proteos spp., Clostridium difficile, Bacillus cereus and Helicobacter pylori. In certain embodiments, the bacteria are resistant to multiple antimicrobial treatments (i.e. multidrug resistant (MDR)).

The compositions of the disclosure can be administered enterally, in other words, by a route of access to the gastrointestinal tract. This includes oral administration, rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy), or by an oral or nasal tube (nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal).

The composition can be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. In some embodiments, it is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The compositions can be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders, capsules, tablets, gels or liquids. The compositions can also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube, or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form, by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository.

If the composition is administered colonoscopically and, optionally, if the composition is administered by other rectal routes (such as an enema or suppository) or even if the subject has an oral administration, the subject can have a colon-cleansing preparation. The colon-cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices, but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose, it can also maximize the proportion of the composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. For example, the colon cleansing preparation may maximize the amount of bacteria of the composition that reach and/or engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. Any ordinarily acceptable colon-cleansing preparation may be used such as those typically provided when a subject undergoes a colonoscopy.

In some embodiments, the subject has not received antibiotics in advance of treatment with the compositions. In other embodiments, the subject has not previously received an antibiotic compound in the one month prior to administration of the composition. In other embodiments, the subject has received one or more treatments with one or more different antibiotic compounds.

In some embodiments, the composition is administered only once. In some embodiments, the composition is administered at intervals greater than two days, such as once every three, four, five or six days, or every week or less frequently than every week. In other embodiments, the preparation can be administered intermittently according to a set schedule, e.g., once a day, once weekly, or once monthly. In another embodiment, the preparation may be administered on a long-term basis to subjects who are at risk for infection with or who may be carriers of pathogens, including subjects who will have an invasive medical procedure (such as surgery), who will be hospitalized, who live in a long-term care or rehabilitation facility, who are exposed to pathogens by virtue of their profession (livestock and animal processing workers), or who could be carriers of pathogens (including hospital workers such as physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals).

In certain embodiments, the methods of the disclosure may be carried out on a subject with a particular profile. For example, 16S rRNA sequencing may be performed for a given subject to identify the bacteria present in their microbiota. The sequencing may either profile the entire microbiome using 16S rRNAsequencing (to the family, genera, or species level), a portion of the subject's microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing, or it may be used to detect the presence or absence of specific candidate bacteria that are biomarkers for health or a particular disease state, such as markers of multi-drug resistant organisms or specific genera of concern, such as Escherichia coli.

The compositions of the present disclosure may be administered to any animal, including, for example, livestock (including cattle, horses, pigs, poultry, and sheep), and humans. As used herein the term “poultry” relates to the class of domesticated fowl (birds) used for food or for their eggs. Poultry includes wildfowl, waterfowl, and game birds. Examples of poultry include, but are not limited to, chicken, broilers, bantams, turkey, duck, geese, guinea fowl, peafowl, quail, dove, pigeon (squab), and pheasant. In certain embodiments, the animal is a companion animal (including pets), such as a dog or a cat for instance. In certain embodiments, the subject may suitably be a human.

Any route of administration is suitable, but oral administration may be preferred. Most typically, a dose is given to every animal directly into the mouth to make sure that the animal swallows the dose. Alternatively, the composition may also be provided as a food supplement, i.e. added to the daily feed of the animal.

To provide for easy use, the composition may be in dosed form. A dose may have a volume in the range of about 0.1 ml to about 100 ml, about 0.2 ml to about 50 ml, about 0.5 ml to about 20 ml, about 1 ml to about 10 ml, about 2 ml to about 8 ml, or about 5 ml.

Any number of doses may be administered, and the skilled person can choose the length of the treatment according to the needs at the respective farm. In certain embodiments, the total number of doses administered to an animal is 10 or less, such as any number selected from the following: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, or any range combining any one of these numbers (except 10) with any one of these number, provided that the second number is higher (e.g., 1 to 3 doses).

The compositions of the disclosure can be useful in a variety of clinical situations. For example, the compositions can be administered as a complementary treatment to antibiotics when a patient is suffering from an acute infection, to reduce the risk of acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes, or when a patient will be in close proximity to others with or at risk of infections (physicians, nurses, hospital workers, family members of those who are ill or hospitalized).

The compositions of the disclosure can be administered with other agents in a combination therapy mode, including anti-microbial agents. Administration can be sequential, over a period of hours or days, or simultaneous.

In one embodiment, the compositions of the disclosure are included in combination therapy with one or more anti-microbial agents, which include anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-viral agents, and anti-parasitic agents.

In vivo transfer of a conjugative large antibiotic resistance plasmids (LARPs) of varying incompatibility types; IncP (broad host range), IncF, IncI, and IncK (narrow host range, Enterobacteriaceae) between bacteria were conducted. Adult W1118 flies (n=12) were separately fed recipient and donor strains. Flies were surface sterilized, homogenized, serially diluted, bacterially enumerated. Donors, recipients, and transconjugants were enumerated for total colony forming units (FIG. 1A) and conjugation frequency (FIG. 1B). Transconjugants were detected in one male and five female guts of the IncP plasmid type, however, no transconjugants were detected in the IncF (FIG. 1), IncI or the IncK plasmid types. Conjugations on the surface of fly media in the absence of flies resulted in the same detection of transconjugants in the IncP groups and none in IncF, IncI, or IncK groups.

Propionic acid used in Drosophila media (FIG. 2) and physiological concentrations of SCFAs in chicken ceca (FIG. 3) were tested for inhibitory effects on conjugation in vitro. Propionate was added to in vitro broth conjugations between E. coli MG1655 (pCVM29188_146) and E. coli HS-4 at fly media concentrations. Propionic acid at as low as half the concentrations of standard Drosophila fly media, resulted in significant decreases in conjugation frequency (transconjugants divided by donors) (FIG. 2). Physiological concentrations of SCFAs in the chicken gut were added to broth conjugations with the conjugation pairs 1) S. Kentucky CVM29188 to E. coli HS-4, and 2) E. coli APEC-02 to E. coli HS-4 (FIG. 3). Acetate and butyrate significantly reduced transconjugant populations but not donor and recipient strains, however physiological concentrations of propionate did not significantly reduce conjugation.

Eight distinct SCFAs (formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, and methylbutyric acid) were tested for inhibitory effects on conjugation in vitro. The SCFAs were added to broth conjugations with the conjugation pair E. coli APEC-02 to E. coli HS-4. All eight SCFAs significantly reduced transconjugant populations (FIG. 4).

### Example 2: SCFAs in Ex Vivo Bacterial Conjugation in Chicken Ceca Explants

Ex vivo ceca explants serve as models for bacterial host interactions. Plasmid transfer and its inhibition by SCFAs were tested using chicken ceca explants to mimic in vivo conditions. Chicken ceca explants were harvested from 2 week-old chickens, cultured in vitro, and used in co-culture with donors/recipients in the presence or absence of SCFAs. Eight distinct SCFAs (formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, methylbutyric acid) at 25 mM were added with the conjugation pair E. coli APEC-02 to E. coli HS-4. All eight SCFAs showed efficacy when used individually (FIG. 5).

### Example 3: Prebiotics Fermented into SCFAs

Free SCFAs are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine. Prebiotics, instead, escape digestion in the small intestine and are fermented into SCFAs in the ceca, thereby increasing SCFA concentrations. The in vivo role of prebiotic-derived SCFAs on the inhibition of HGT and AR incidence both in the naïve and challenged gut microbiotas will be examined. Following the guidance of Iowa State IACUC protocol, day-old White-Leghorn chickens will be acclimated 3 days and given standard feed (Purina organic chicken starter) and water ad libitum. Chickens will be fed 0 or 0.5% mannan-, galacto-, or fructo-oligosaccharide (MOS, GOS, FOS) prebiotics. Half of each treatment group will be orally inoculated with plasmid donor S. Kentucky CVM29188, and resident E. coli will act as a recipient. Fecal populations of the donor, resident Enterobacteriaceae recipients, and transconjugants will be enumerated on selective media. Ceca contents will be analyzed by gas chromatography for SCFA concentrations and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the microbiota and resistome. Fecal contents will be collected for in vitro conjugation inhibition assays. Plasmid transfer is expected to be reduced in hosts with elevated cecal concentrations of SCFAs in the prebiotics-added diet group compared to the control (no-prebiotics).

### Example 4: Inhibition of Bacterial Conjugation of Various Plasmid Incompatibility Types

A single bacterial strain, Escherichia coli strain SP915 (MG1655 derivative) was used as the bacterial plasmid donor for the three plasmids pKJK5-GM (IncP), pCVM29188_146 (IncF) and pC20-GM (IncI). Plasmid transfer was assessed in conjugation containing the donor and the recipient Escherichia coli strain HS-4. Cultures were grown overnight and standardized to an optical density of approximately 1.0 at 600 nm in fresh Luria broth media, and mixed 1:1 and incubated with the addition of either sterile distilled water, or 0.025 M short chain fatty acid (acetate, propionate, or butyrate) for six hours at 37° C. Solutions were serially diluted and plated on selective media for enumeration.

A significant reduction in Logic) transformed colony forming units per 1 mL volume of transconjugants (recipients that acquire the plasmid) between SCFA treated groups compared to water treated controls was observed in all three plasmids tested (FIG. 6). These data demonstrate there is a broad ability of these treatments to impact bacterial plasmid transfer which may occur in the gut environment. SOFA treatments inhibit the transfer of not only the narrow host range IncF plasmid incompatibility group, but also the broad host range IncP and narrow host range IncI plasmid incompatibilities group.
