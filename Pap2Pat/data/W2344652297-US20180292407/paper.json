    "title": "Novel method for the high-throughput production of phosphorylation site-specific monoclonal antibodies",
    "date": "2016-04-29",
    "abstract": "Threonine phosphorylation accounts for 10% of all phosphorylation sites compared with 0.05% for tyrosine and 90% for serine. Although monoclonal antibody generation for phospho-serine and -tyrosine proteins is progressing, there has been limited success regarding the production of monoclonal antibodies against phospho-threonine proteins. We developed a novel strategy for generating phosphorylation site-specific monoclonal antibodies by cloning immunoglobulin genes from single plasma cells that were fixed, intracellularly stained with fluorescently labeled peptides and sorted without causing RNA degradation. Our high-throughput fluorescence activated cell sorting-based strategy, which targets abundant intracellular immunoglobulin as a tag for fluorescently labeled antigens, greatly increases the sensitivity and specificity of antigen-specific plasma cell isolation, enabling the high-efficiency production of monoclonal antibodies with desired antigen specificity. This approach yielded yet-undescribed guinea pig monoclonal antibodies against threonine 18-phosphorylated p53 and threonine 68-phosphorylated CHK2 with high affinity and specificity. Our method has the potential to allow the generation of monoclonal antibodies against a variety of phosphorylated proteins.",

                        "Terminally differentiated PCs express relatively few cell surface immunoglobulins but do contain significant quantities of immunoglobulins in the abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum combined with a well-developed Golgi apparatus. Taking advantage of these features of PCs, we and others have reported a histochemical technique for visualizing ASPCs by labeling intracellular immunoglobulins with antigens12181920. We hypothesized that a powerful method for generating mAb could be established if cells stained intracellularly with a fluorescently labeled antigen could be sorted without causing RNA degradation. To test this idea, we first attempted to determine the optimal fixative for preserving the antigen-binding activity of cytosolic immunoglobulins. The OKT10 hybridoma that produces an antibody against CD38 was used as the starting material. When the hybridomas were treated for 30\u2009min with commonly used fixatives, permeabilized and stained intracellularly with DyLight 488-labeled CD38 and anti-mouse IgG, CD38 binding activity was only found in PFA-fixed cells; in contrast, intracellular immunoglobulin was detectable with all types of fixatives, except for glutaraldehyde (Fig. 1a). We next tested whether mRNA can be extracted from cells fixed with PFA and intracellularly stained with anti-mouse IgG (processed cells). When a 100 cell-equivalent lysate prepared from the processed cells was subjected to RT-PCR, a short amplicon (71 bp) of the mouse immunoglobulin gamma constant gene was amplified, but due to RNA-protein crosslinking, the yield was reduced compared to those treated with other fixatives (Fig. 1b). We next tested whether the full-length V gene could be amplified from the processed cell at a single-cell level. OKT10 hybridomas were fixed with PFA for 10, 15, or 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C, stained intracellularly with anti-mouse IgG and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and subjected to FACS for single-cell isolation (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1d, the full-length gamma heavy chain variable (VH) gene could not be efficiently amplified from single hybridomas via rapid amplification of 5\u2032 cDNA ends PCR (5\u2032 RACE PCR), regardless of the fixation time. However, 5\u2032 RACE PCR success rates were dramatically improved when cells fixed within a short time period were treated with Protease K at 50\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009hour to reverse crosslinking (Fig. 1d,e).",
                        "To investigate the lower detection limit for the sensitivity of this fixed cell-based ASPC screening method (termed FIXAA), OKT10 hybridomas were serially diluted into Jurkat cells at ratios of 1:100\u20131:10,000, and these artificial mixtures were fixed with PFA and intracellularly stained with anti-mouse IgG, DAPI and DsRed. In an effort to eliminate background noise, DsRed was used to label damaged cells because they tend to be sticky and thus bind many types of reagents. To optimize flow cytometric gating, the FL2 threshold was adjusted to a level that minimizes the background noise caused by fixative-induced autofluorescence and non-specific DsRed-binding. As shown in Fig. 2, a fraction of hybridomas defined as anti-mouse IgGhigh and DsRednegative (R3 gate) formed a discrete population that was clearly distinguishable from Jurkat cells. Single-cell isolation of this population followed by 5\u2032RACE PCR resulted in VH gene amplification with a high success rate (87%) for a 1:100 mixture. Notably, the VH gene could be reproducibly amplified from a 1:10,000 mixture with an overall success rate of 47%."

                        "Retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR\u03b3t) plays a crucial role in Th17 cell differentiation21. Recent evidence indicates the increasing importance of ROR\u03b3t in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases, yet the generation of a mAb against ROR\u03b3t that does not cross-react with ROR\u03b3 is difficult. This is because ROR\u03b3t and its splicing isoform ROR\u03b3 only differ in their N-terminal extensions, consisting of 3 and 24 amino acids, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1a)2223. Thus, we attempted to evaluate the potential usefulness of FIXAA by generating a mAb against ROR\u03b3t. After immunization of guinea pigs with a KLH-conjugated ROR\u03b3t peptide, lymph node cells were fixed with PFA, stained intracellularly with a DyLight streptavidin 488-conjugated ROR\u03b3t peptide (ROR\u03b3t-488), anti-IgG and DAPI. To eliminate plasma cells cross-reacting with ROR\u03b3, the cells were further stained with a DyLight streptavidin 550-conjugated ROR\u03b3 peptide (ROR\u03b3-550) and then subjected to FACS analysis. A fraction of ROR\u03b3t-specific PCs characterized as ROR\u03b3t-488high, ROR\u03b3-550negative and anti-IgGhigh was focused into a narrow area (R4) that was sufficiently separated from rest of the cell population (Supplementary Figure 1b). A single cell-based 5\u2032 RACE PCR of these R4-gated cells resulted in the amplification of cognate pairs of VH and light chain kappa variable (VL) genes. DNA transfection of pairs of immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and immunoglobulin light (IgL) genes into 293 cells resulted in the production of mAbs. Western blot screening revealed that 19 out of 20 mAbs specifically detected ROR\u03b3t but not ROR\u03b3 (Supplementary Figure 1c,d). By applying FIXAA, we also produced mAbs against HTLVI Tax and BCL11b from peptide-immunized rats and rabbits, indicating the usefulness of FIXAA for generating mAbs from immunized animals (Supplementary Figure 2)."

                        "To validate the application of FIXAA for isolating ASPCs expressing phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, guinea pigs were immunized with a triphospho-p53 peptide phosphorylated at S15, T18, and S20. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the animals\u2019 lymph node cells stained intracellularly with anti-guinea pig IgG, triphospho-p53 peptide conjugated DyLight 488 streptavidin (TP-p53), unmodified-p53 peptide conjugated DyLight 550 streptavidin (UM-p53) and DAPI revealed phospho-p53-specific PCs intensely labeled with TP-p53 and anti-guinea pig IgG but not with UM-p53. Non-specific PCs were stained with anti-guinea pig IgG alone, and pan-p53-specific PCs or non-specifically stained cells were labeled with TP-p53, UM-p53 and anti-guinea pig IgG (Fig. 3a). Having confirmed that phospho-p53-specific PCs can be clearly distinguished from other cells via intracellular staining, we next attempted to isolate phospho-p53-specific PCs by FIXAA. Positive staining with TP-p53 and negative staining with UM-p53 revealed a clearly discrete fraction of phospho-p53-specific PCs (R4-gate) defined as anti-guinea pig IgGhigh, TP-p53high and UM-p53negative and comprising less than 0.01% of the original lymphocyte population (Fig. 3b). Single cell-based 5\u2032RACE PCR of the R4-gated cells resulted in the amplification of cognate pairs of VH and VL genes, with a success ratio of 82% (79/96) (Fig. 3c). In addition, DNA transfection of pairs of linear IgH and IgL genes into 293FT cells resulted in the production of mAbs, 96% (47/48) of which reacted with triphospho-p53 peptide (Fig. 3d). In a parallel experiment, we also sought to isolate phospho-p53-specific PCs by ERIAA. When FACS analysis was performed with live lymph node cells stained with ER-tracker, TP-p53, UM-p53 and anti-guinea pig IgG, the phospho-p53-specific PCs (R4-gate) characterized as ER-trackerhigh, TP-p53medium, UM-p53negative and anti-guinea pig IgGmedium appeared as a less discrete population (Fig. 3e). Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, single cell-based 5\u2032RACE PCR of R4-gated cells resulted in a low success ratio of paired V gene amplification (34%), and only 16% of the expressed mAbs reacted with the triphospho-p53 peptide (Fig. 3f,g). These results clearly demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of FIXAA for isolating PCs expressing phosphorylation site-specific antibodies.",
                        "We next attempted to identify a mAb that binds to the p53 peptide phosphorylated at T18 (pT18) because mAbs against T18-phosphorylated p53 have yet to be described. Among 51 mAbs screened by ELISA, we found five clones that specifically bound to pT18. To test the specificity of these isolated clones, we performed immunofluorescence antibody screening and found that clone 23 (#23) reacted strongly with the nuclei of etoposide-treated 293FT cells. A signal for #23 was barely visible in control 293FT cells, whereas a signal for the pan-p53 antibody was predominantly detectable in nuclei. Lambda protein phosphatase (\u03bbPP) was applied to the etoposide-treated 293FT cells, which resulted in the loss of #23 labeling, though the pan-p53 antibody signal was not affected (Fig. 4a). The specificity of this mAb for p53 phosphorylated at T18 was confirmed by peptide competition assays, in which #23 was preincubated with either non-phosphorylated or a series of phosphorylated p53 peptides. Although incubation with either non-phosphorylated or peptides phosphorylated at sites other than T18 did not affect the detection of p53 localization in etoposide-treated 293FT cells, incubation with peptides with phosphorylation at T18 did cause an almost complete loss of reactivity (Fig. 4b). To further validate the specificity of the mAb, we carried out immunofluorescent analysis of the p53-null cell line Saos-2 transiently expressing either wild-type p53 (WT) or a T18 phosphorylation-dead alanine point mutant (T18A). As shown in Fig. 4c, #23 reacted strongly with some but not all of the nuclei of Saos-2 cells expressing WT. No signal was observed in cells expressing the T18A mutant. These data show that #23 specifically recognizes p53 phosphorylated at 18T. We also performed a Western blot analysis with total 293FT cell lysate; #23 identified a single band in etoposide-treated cells that comigrated with the band produced by the anti-pan-p53 antibody, and treatment of the cell lysate with \u03bbPP demonstrated the specificity of the #23 antibody for the phosphorylated protein (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, preincubation of the mAb with pT18, but not peptides without phosphorylation at T18, abolished immunoreactivity (Fig. 4e). Finally, #23 exhibited a dissociation constant (KD) value of 0.2\u2009nM toward the pT18 peptide (Fig. 4f).",
                        "CHK2 is involved in the control of cell cycle checkpoints and also participates in transducing signals of DNA damage and replication stress. CHK2 activation in response to DNA damage requires phosphorylation at threonine 68 (T68), resulting in DNA damage-dependent nuclear foci24. To demonstrate the usefulness and reproducibility of our method for efficiently producing phosphorylation site-specific mAbs, we generated mAbs against T68-phosphorylated CHK2 and examined whether the isolated mAbs can detect T68-phosphorylated CHK2. Among 17 mAbs screened, #34 specifically detected CHK2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manor. The mAb exhibited a high affinity toward the pT68 peptide with KD value of 0.08\u2009nM (Supplementary Figure 3). These data clearly demonstrate that our method can efficiently produce high-quality mAbs against phosphorylated proteins."

                "Antibodies offer a platform for the analysis of various post-translational modifications2526, and the need for modification-specific antibodies continues to grow with increasing types of modification per protein. However, highly specific antibodies against post-translationally modified proteins are difficult to produce by conventional methods9. To isolate rare ASPCs that express phosphorylation site-specific antibodies from animals, we developed a new FACS-based ASPC separation method, FIXAA, which targets abundant intracellular immunoglobulin as a tag for fluorescently labeled antigens. Analysis of artificial samples of hybridomas spiked with Jurkat cells demonstrated a lower detection limit for FIXAA sensitivity of less than 0.01%. FIXAA is not only able to isolate rare PCs with high purity, but by employing a subtraction step that eliminates PCs expressing antibodies against undesired antigens, it is also able to specifically isolate PCs expressing ROR\u03b3t-specific antibodies that do not cross-react with ROR\u03b3. FIXAA is particularly suited for generating mAbs against a phosphorylated protein by removing PCs that react with an unmodified peptide. We achieved phospho-peptide-specific PC isolation from guinea pig lymph node cells with high purity and succeeded in generating mAbs against T18-phosphorylated p53 and T68-phosphorylated CHK2.",
                "Although FIXAA enables the isolation of ASPCs with high specificity and sensitivity, the technique requires membrane permeabilization to expose the intracellular immunoglobulins to the fluorescently labeled antigens, which also allows RNases access to RNA. Thus, FIXAA requires stringent precautions against endogenous and exogenous RNases, including the cleaning of the FACS sample line, the inactivation of cellular RNases with PFA, the use of RNase inhibitors in the incubation steps and the preparation of RNase-free antigen. With respect to antigens, chemically synthesized peptides are well suited for FIXAA because they can be prepared under RNase-free conditions. Another limitation of FIXAA is the difficulty in amplifying full-length V genes from PFA-fixed cells because the PFA-fixation process results in cross-linkage between RNA and proteins, making RNA more recalcitrant to extraction27. PFA also causes the covalent modification of RNA by mono-methylol, which impairs the reverse transcriptase reaction28. Although several attempts have been made to address these problems, successful PCR amplification has been limited to short targets29303132. We demonstrated that full-length V genes could be reproducibly amplified by 5\u2032RACE PCR from fixed and intracellularly stained single cells. Important aspects for the success of our procedure are as follows: (1) optimized fixation and protocols that reverse crosslinking to provide minimally modified RNA; (2) a single cell-based automatic cDNA synthesis system that enables microscale mRNA purification, reverse transcription and 3\u2032 homopolymer-tailing; (3) abundantly expressing immunoglobulin genes in PCs might also facilitate full-length V gene amplification from fixed cells. We envisage using two ASPC isolation methods, ERIAA and FIXAA, for the generation of mAbs: ERIAA for the isolation of relatively abundant ASPCs with roughly purified antigens; FIXAA for the isolation of rare ASPCs with RNase-free antigens.",
                "Taken together, this novel method provides a significant advantage over conventional animal immunization techniques and is particularly well suited for generating mAbs against a variety of phosphorylated proteins using chemically synthesized peptides."
