The inventors of the present invention focused on this point and assumed that the signal obtained by binding of a labelled antigen to antibodies in the cytoplasm may be much stronger than the signal obtained by binding of a labelled antigen to membrane-bound antibodies. However, it was assumed that in order to actually allow binding of an antigen to antibodies in the cytoplasm, preliminary treatments are required such as fixing of proteins with a crosslinking reagent and cell membrane permeation treatment with a detergent. However, it is predicted that such preliminary treatments may highly likely cause intermolecular crosslinking between proteins and mRNA or degradation of RNA due to nucleases in the cytoplasm. Therefore, it has been thought to be very difficult to extract mRNA from single cells which have undergone fixation with a crosslinking reagent, membrane permeation with a detergent and staining with a labelled antigen and to amplify gene fragments with 250 bp or more in length from the extracted mRNA (NPL 5 and 6).",

When cells are subjected to a preliminary treatment for fixing proteins using a crosslinking reagent such as glutaraldehyde with the purpose of fixing antibodies and mRNA in the cells, proteins constituting the cells are fixed. However, as glutaraldehyde is an irreversible crosslinking reagent, antibodies and mRNA in the cells are degenerated. Contrary to this, the crosslinking reagent used in the present invention is a reversible crosslinking reagent having the cell membrane permeability. Because of the cell membrane permeability, antibodies and mRNA in the cells may be intracellularly fixed and the reversible crosslinking reagent is used, so that mRNA can be decrosslinked to allow preparation of cDNA in the stage of cDNA preparation from mRNA which is the later step. Examples of such a reversible crosslinking reagent include formalin and a bivalent crosslinking reagent having an S\u2014S bond in a spacer chain. Examples of the bivalent crosslinking reagent having an S\u2014S bond in a spacer chain include dithiobis [succinimidyl propionate] (DSP) and the like.",

Antibodies are fixed while having a reactivity with a labelled antigen of interest, and mRNA of the antibodies may be decrosslinked and used for cDNA synthesis in the later step. The extent of fixing varies according to the type and concentration of the reversible crosslinking reagent and the temperature and time of the treatment. By changing the type and concentration of the reversible crosslinking reagent and the temperature and time of the treatment according to the type of the antibody-producing cells used, an optimal fixation may result. Fixing may be carried out, for example, under such conditions that the collected cell population containing antibody-producing cells are immersed in an aqueous solution such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% to 10% reversible crosslinking reagent at a temperature in the range of 0\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C. or preferably 0\u00b0 C. to 10\u00b0 C. for 1 to 60 minutes (the collected cell population containing antibody-producing cells are dispersed in a reversible crosslinking reagent-containing aqueous solution). According to the conditions, antibodies and mRNA thereof may be fixed under a good condition (without substantial degeneration). The thus obtained fixed cell population is preferably separated from the solution by centrifugation and the like and used in the next step."

                                "In the step (4), at least one single cell which is reacted with the labelled antigen of interest is separated as a single cell. The cells reacted with the labelled antigen of interest are first identified by using the label of the labelled antigen of interest as a guide and identified single cells are separated.",
                                "In the method of the present invention, antibodies and mRNA thereof in the cells are fixed in the step (1) and the fixed cell population is treated with the detergent to make pores on the cell membrane in the step (2). Therefore, the labelled antigen of interest can easily enter the cells producing antibodies toward the antigen of interest through the pores on the cell membrane. The labelled antigen of interest binds to the antibody in the cells which are fixed and subjected to the cell membrane lysis treatment and allows identification of cells containing the labelled antigen of interest bound to antibodies. The cells which retain the labelled antigen of interest therein are highly possible to be antibody-producing cells because it is highly possible that the labelled antigen of interest binds to antibodies in the cells.",
                                "The cells identified with the label of the labelled antigen of interest as a guide are separated as single cells. Separation of the identified antibody-producing cells may be carried out with, for example, a cell sorter. Separation of single antibody-producing cells by using a cell sorter may be carried out according to a well-known method. Cells may be selected and separated as a cell population including more than one cell or, preferably, each cell is individually selected and separated. The cells selected are highly possible to exhibit a binding ability to the antigen of interest. However, the cells may not always have an identical antibody toward the antigen of interest and it is expected that the amino acid sequences in the antigen-binding sites of the antibodies vary. Therefore, it is possible to obtain different monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind to the same antigen of interest by individually selecting and separating the cells and using each cell to the method for producing an antibody or a fragment of the antibody with specificity toward the antigen of interest described hereinbelow.",

However, there is actually a possibility of contamination of labelled cells due to nonspecific staining (reaction with the labelled antigen of interest). Therefore, non-specifically stained cells may be eliminated (excluded) by using a labelled antigen of no interest, if necessary. For example, in Example 2, an antigen of no interest, the DsRed protein, is added to a cell staining solution in order to exclude DsRed protein positive cells as non-specifically stained cells. In Example 3, a non-phosphorylated peptide is added to a cell staining solution in order to separate phosphorylated peptide positive cells from non-phosphorylated peptide positive cells.",
                                "It is preferable to carry out at least one of steps (1) to (4) above in the presence of an RNase inhibitor from the viewpoint of suppressing degradation of mRNA collected from cells to facilitate preparation of cDNA of a monoclonal antibody with specificity toward an antigen of interest or a fragment thereof. Examples of the RNase inhibitor include DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate), vanadyl ribonucleotide, inhibitory proteins for ribonuclease A, ribonuclease B and ribonuclease C and anti-ribonuclease antibodies. Examples of commercially available RNase inhibitors include RNaseOUT (Life Technologies Corporation), RNasin\u2122 (Promega Corporation), Ribonuclease Inhibitor (derived from pig liver) (Takara Bio Inc.) and the like. It is preferable to carry out all of the steps (1) to (4) in the presence of an RNase inhibitor, and more specifically, it is preferable to add an appropriate amount of RNase inhibitor to solutions containing cells, antibodies and the antigen used in the steps. An appropriate amount of the RNase inhibitor may be appropriately selected according to the type of the RNase inhibitor, the type of the solution and the like.",
                                "When materials of the labelled antigen of interest used in the step (3) are prevented from contamination of RNase, the recovery rate of mRNA may be increased and the antibody with specificity toward the antigen of interest may be prepared with an increased efficiency.",

                                "According to the method, an antibody which exhibits a specific binding ability to an antigen of interest or an antibody fragment (the fragment per se exhibits a specific binding ability to an antigen of interest) which exhibits a specific binding ability to an antigen of interest may be produced.",
                                "(5) cDNA Preparing Step",
                                "In the step (5), mRNA is separated from at least one single cell obtained by the cell separation method of the present invention and cDNA is prepared from the separated mRNA.",
                                "For separation of mRNA, mRNA in the cells fixed in the step (1) may be defixed (decrosslinked). A manner of defixing may be appropriately selected according to the type of the reversible crosslinking reagent used in the step (1). When the reversible crosslinking reagent used in the step (1) is formalin, defixing may be carried out by heating the isolated cells and when an amino group-containing group coexists during heating, defixing (decrosslinking) may be facilitated. Examples of the amino group-containing group include tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, amino acids, ethanolamine and the like. Defixing allows recovery of mRNA from cells with an increased efficiency and an increase in the recovery of cDNA. The conditions for the heating treatment may be appropriately selected by taking the extent of fixation, the type and concentration of the amino group-containing compound and the stability of mRNA into account. For example, heating may be carried out at 20\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. for 1 to 120 minutes. It is more preferable to carry out defixing by heat treating the isolated cells in the presence of a protease. The conditions for the heating treatment and the amount of the protease may be appropriately selected by taking the type and the amount of the protease, the extent of fixation and the stability of mRNA into account. For example, heating may be carried out at 40\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C. for 1 to 120 minutes. The amount of the protease may be in the range of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml to 100 \u03bcg/ml. The protease may be any existing protease and may be, for example, protease K. The heating treatment in the presence of protease K allows defixing of mRNA from the isolated cells with an increased efficiency and increases the proportion of obtaining variable region gene fragments of antibody genes. As a result, the antigen specific monoclonal antibody may be efficiently prepared in the later step.",
                                "When the reversible crosslinking reagent used in the step (1) is dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), defixing may be carried out by treating the isolated cells with a reducing agent such as \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and sodium borohydride. Similarly in this case, defixing allows recovery of mRNA in the cells with an increased efficiency and may increase the recovery of cDNA. The conditions for the reducing treatment may be appropriately selected by taking the extent of fixing, the type and concentration of the reducing agent and the stability of mRNA into account. The reducing treatment may be carried out, for example, at 20\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. for 1 to 120 minutes. Defixing by reducing treatment may also be carried out in combination with the protease treatment.",
                                "Separation of mRNA from at least one single cell and preparation of cDNA may be carried out according to well-known methods. For example, methods disclosed in PTL 2 and NPL 4 (the method by Kurosawa et al.) may be used (the entire disclosures of PTL 2 and NPL 4 are specifically incorporated herein by reference). It is preferable to separate mRNA from one separated antibody-producing cell in view of obtaining a heavy chain gene and a light chain gene of the antibody toward the antigen of interest. However, mRNA may be separated from two or more separated antibody-producing cells and in this case, the separated mRNA is a mixture of mRNAs from respective cells. For example, when mRNA is separated from two antibody-producing cells, two pairs of heavy chain genes and light chain genes are cloned. In this case, the possibility of obtaining the combination of the correct heavy chain gene and light chain gene is 50%: however, the correct pair may be attained from a technological standpoint. However, the possibility of obtaining the correct combination of the heavy chain gene and the light chain gene from mRNA collected from more than 10 antibody-producing cells is less than 1%. Although it is possible to attain the correct combination, the efficiency decreases. Therefore, mRNA is preferably separated from 10 or less separated antibody-producing cells.",
                                "More specifically, collection of mRNA from antibodies toward an antigen of interest and preparation of cDNA from the collected mRNA may be carried out by employing the method disclosed in, for example, WO 2009/091048 (US 2011/0020879 A1) (the entire disclosures of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference). The prepared cDNA may be cloned, if necessary. Cloning may be carried out according to the cloning method employing the homologous recombination disclosed in WO 2009/110606 and US 2011/0117609 A1 (the entire disclosures of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference). Further, the base sequence of the prepared cDNA may be identified. The identification of the base sequence of the cDNA may be carried out by using well-known DNA sequencing methods. By identifying the base sequence of the cDNA, an antibody gene toward the antigen of interest may be identified.",
                                "However, in the method of the present invention, it is preferable that the second primer used for cDNA synthesis is modified from the above well-known methods. In the method of the present invention, mRNA is inevitably degraded during the steps before cDNA synthesis. Therefore, the efficacy of full-length cDNA synthesis is low and a smearing band tends to be amplified after normal 5\u2032RACE PCR (compare the bands in \u201c10 min\u201d and the bands in \u201cunfixed\u201d in FIG. 1D which is the results of Example 1. The bands amplified from the cells of \u201c10 min\u201d are smeared. Similar tendency is observed in FIG. 2C which is the results of Example 2).",
                                "Thus, in the present invention, it is preferable that the second primer for cDNA synthesis, i.e., a sense primer for the second round of PCR, has the sequence around the initiation codon of an immunoglobulin of interest in order to amplify only the full-length antibody gene. For example, in Example 3 (C), a sequence around the initiation codon of the guinea pig immunoglobulin is used as a sense primer for the second round of PCR. When the sequence around the initiation codon of the immunoglobulin is known, the primer may be prepared based on known information or sequence information of the immunoglobulin gene expressed in the immunized animal (in case of Example 3, guinea pig) obtained by high throughput sequencing."

The #23 antibody was identified as an antibody clone which allowed specific signal detection in the nuclei of HEK293 cells in which DNA damage was caused by etoposide treatment. The signal obtained with the #23 antibody disappeared in the cells treated with \u03bb phosphatase. The results are shown in FIG. 3H. The signal also disappeared in the presence of the p53 peptide having pT18, while the signal did not disappear in the presence of the peptides in which neighboring serine 15 and serine 20 were phosphorylated. The results are shown in FIG. 3I. In western blotting analysis, the #23 antibody allowed detection of a specific band at 50 kDa from the etoposide treated HEK293. The signal obtained with the #23 antibody disappeared in the cells treated with X phosphatase. The results are shown in FIG. 3J. The signal also disappeared in the presence of excess p53 peptide having pT18, while the signal did not disappear in the presence of the peptides in which neighboring serine 15 and serine 20 were phosphorylated.

                                "To the solution was added 3 ml of PBS solution containing 1 \u03bcg/ml of DAPI, thereby the cell nucleus was stained.",
                                "(B) The cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer in order to separate pT68-CHK2 specific plasma cells. The cells were R1 (FSC vs SSC) and R2 (DAPI) gated to identify a single cell population. From the single cell population, cells having autofluorescence, non-specifically stained cells and CHK2 specific plasma cells reacting with the UM-CHK2 peptide were eliminated with the FL2 channel (R3 gate). From the cells, anti-mouse IgG strongly positive and pT68-CHK2 peptide strongly positive cells were identified as pT68-CHK2 specific plasma cells (R4). The cells appearing in the R4 gate had 100 times and 10 times IgG stronger fluorescence intensities than other cells with regard to the binding to the pT68-CHK2 peptide and to the anti-guinea pig antibody, respectively. The results are shown in FIG. 4A.",
                                "(C) The R4-gated cells were subjected to single cell sorting by the same manner as in Example 2 (cell isolation). Thereafter, the V gene was amplified by isolated 5\u2032 RACE PCR by the same manner as in Example 1 (B), the full-length heavy chain and light chain immunoglobulin genes were prepared from the obtained V gene according to the method by Kurosawa et al. (NPL 4) and the genes were introduced into 293FT cells to prepare recombinant antibodies. The obtained antibodies were analyzed for the specificity by ELISA. The results are shown in FIG. 4B. Among the antibodies, 59% (10/17) were specific to the pT68-CHK2 peptide.",

The #34 antibody was identified as an antibody clone which allowed specific signal detection in the nuclei of HEK293 cells in which DNA break was induced by camptothecin treatment. The results are shown in FIG. 4C. The signal disappeared in the presence of excess pT68-CHK2 peptide, while the signal did not disappear in the presence of the UM-CHK2 peptide. The signal also disappeared in the cells treated with X phosphatase. The results are shown in FIG. 4D. From the above results, it was found that the #34 antibody allows detection of endogenous CHK2 in which threonine 68 is phosphorylated.",
