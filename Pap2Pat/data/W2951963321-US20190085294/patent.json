                        "There is a desire in the medical, scientific, and diagnostic fields to reprogram an easily obtainable cell into a cell that is generally harder to obtain, or to reprogram a cell to have new or different functionalities, without fusing or exchanging material with an oocyte or another stem cell.",
                        "According to a first mechanism, a stem cell can naturally divide or differentiate into another stem cell, progenitor, precursor, or somatic cell. According to a second mechanism, somatic cell can sometimes transiently change its phenotype or express certain markers when placed in certain conditions, and then revert back when placed back into the original conditions. According to a second mechanism, the phenotype of many cells can be changed through forced expression of certain genes (for example, stably transfecting the c-myc gene into fibroblasts turns them into immortal cells having neuroprogenitor characteristics), however once this forced gene expression is removed, the cells slowly revert back to their original state. Therefore, none of the three above mechanisms should be considered true reprogramming: the first is considered natural differentiation which is part of a cell program that is already in place (going from a more undifferentiated to a more differentiated state), the second is a transient phenotypical change, and the third is a constantly forced cell type. A true stem cell: (i) self-renews almost \u2018indefinitely\u2019 (for significantly longer than a somatic cell), (ii) is not a cancerous cell, (iii) is not artificially maintained by forced gene expression or similar means (must also be able to be maintained in standard stem cell media), (iv) can differentiate to progenitor, precursor, somatic or other more differentiated cell type (of the same lineage), and (v) has all the characteristics of a stem cell and not just certain markers or gene expression or morphological appearance.",
                        "Despite the numerous scientific and patent publications claiming successful reprogramming or dedifferentiation, generally into a stem cell, almost all of these publications do not disclose true reprogramming because they fall under one of the mechanisms mentioned above. For instance, Bhasin (WO2010/088735), Cifarelli et al. (US2010/0003223), Kremer et al. (US2004/0009595), and Winnier et al. (US2010/0047908) all refer to reprogramming, dedifferentiation, and/or obtained stem cells (or progenitors) as phenotypical cell changes based only on a change in cell surface markers after culture in different media with supplements, with no evidence of true reprogramming or an actual stem cell (non-cancerous self-renewal with stem cells markers and no differentiation markers). The same is true for Benneti (WO2009/079007) who used increased expression of Oct4 and Sox2. Others, such as Akamatsu et al. (WO2010/052904) and You et al. (WO2007/097494, US2009/0246870), refer to having made stem cells, but these came about through constant artificial gene induction delivered by retrovirus (similar to cMyc) with no evidence of true stem cells that are not immortal/ tumorigenic, and stable instead of transient. Others, such as Chen et al. (US2005/0176707) and You et al. (US2009/0227023), have made \u201cmultipotent cells\u201d, but not stem cells. In addition these alledged multipotent cells were not stable (in the case of You et al. the cells could not even proliferate) and both used constant media supplements and conditions to force the phenotypical change. Yet others, such as Oliveri et al. (WO2009/018832) and Zahner et al. (US2002/0136709), have claimed the making of pluripotent, totipotent, multipotent, and/or unipotent cells automatically through genome-wide DNA demethylation and histone acetylation, but with no evidence of a stable, non-cancerous, true cell line.",
                        "True reprogramming appears to have been achieved with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) created independently by Yamanaka's group (Takahashi et al., 2007) and Thomson's group (Yu et al., 2007), and potentially by others before them, and although many of these cells were later found to be cancerous, some of them were not. These cells can be induced by true reprogramming since it was later shown that they can also be induced by non-gene integrating transient transfection (Soldner et al., 2009; Woltjen et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009) as well as by RNA (Warren et al., 2010) or protein (Kim et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009) alone or by small molecules (Lyssiotis et al., 2009), and by similar methods. However, these cells are essentially identical to embryonic stem cells and have the same problems of uncontrolled growth, teratoma formation, and potential tumor formation.",
                        "A more desirable option is to have multipotent stem cells or pluripotent-like cells whose lineage and differentiation potential is more restricted so that they do not readily form teratomas and uncontrolled growth. There is thus a need for methods of creating multipotent stem cells, multipotent stem-like cells, and stem-like cells and method of reprogramming or transforming easily obtainable cells to highly desirable multipotent stem cells, multipotent stem-like cells, and stem-like cells.",
                        "Neural Stem-Like Cells (NSLC)",
                        "Repairing the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the frontiers that medical science has yet to conquer. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke can have devastating consequences for those who are afflicted. A central hope for these conditions is to develop cell populations that can reconstitute the neural network, and bring the functions of the nervous system back in line. For this reason, there is a great deal of evolving interest in neural stem and progenitor cells. Up until the present time, it was generally thought that multipotent neural progenitor cells commit early in the differentiation pathway to either neural restricted cells or glia restricted cells.",
                        "Neural stem cells have promise for tissue regeneration from disease or injury; however, such therapies will require precise control over cell function to create the necessary cell types. There is not yet a complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and it is thus difficult to fully explore the plasticity of neural stem cell population derived from any given region of the brain or developing fetus.",
                        "The CNS, traditionally believed to have limited regenerative capabilities, retains a limited number of neural stem cells in adulthood, particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone that replenishes olfactory bulb neurons (Singec I et al., 2007; Zielton R, 2008). The availability of precursor cells is a key prerequisite for a transplant-based repair of defects in the mature nervous system. Thus, donor cells for neural transplants are largely derived from the fetal brain. This creates enormous ethical problems, in addition to immuno-rejection, and it is questionable whether such an approach can be used for the treatment of a large number of patients since neural stem cells can lose some of their potency with each cell division.",
                        "Neural stem cells provide promising therapeutic potential for cell-replacement therapies in neurodegenerative disease (Mimeault et al., 2007). To date, numerous therapeutic transplantations have been performed exploiting various types of human fetal tissue as the source of donor material. However, ethical and practical considerations and their inaccessibility limit the availability as a cell source for transplantation therapies (Ninomiy M et al., 2006).",
                        "To overcome barriers and limitations to the derivation of patient specific cells, one approach has been to use skin cells and inducing the trans-differentiation to neural stem cells and/or to neurons (Levesque et al., 2000). Transdifferentiation has been receiving increasing attention during the past years , and trans-differentiation of mammalian cells has been achieved in co-culture or by manipulation of cell culture conditions. Alteration of cell fate can be induced artificially in vitro by treatment of cell cultures with microfilament inhibitors (Shea et al., 1990), hormones (Yeomans et al., 1976), and Calcium-ionophores (Shea, 1990; Sato et al., 1991). Mammalian epithelial cells can be induced to acquire muscle-like shape and function (Paterson and Rudland, 1985), pancreatic exocrine duct cells can acquire an insulin-secreting endocrine phenotype (Bouwens, 1998a, b), and bone marrow stem cells can be differentiated into liver cells (Theise et al., 2000) and into neuronal cells (Woodbury et al., 2000). Other such as Page et al. (US 2003/0059939) have transdifferentiated somatic cells to neuronal cells by culturing somatic cells in the presence of cytoskeletal, acetylation, and methylation inhibitors, but after withdrawal of the priming agent, neuron morphology and established synapses last for not much than a few weeks in vitro, and complete conversion to a fully functional and stable type of neuron has never been demonstrated. These are thus transient cell phenotypes. Complete conversion to a fully functional and stable type of neuroprogenitor or neural stem cell has also never been demonstrated. Acquisition of a stable phenotype following transdifferentiation has been one of the major challenges facing the field.",
                        "Thus, there is a need in the biomedical field for stable, potent, and preferably autologouos neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells, as well as neurons and glial cells for use in the treatment of various neurological disorders and diseases. The same is true for many other types of cells. Recently, evidence have been obtained that genes of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) class are important regulators of several steps in neural lineage development, and over-expression of several neurogenic bHLH factors results in conversion of non-determined ectoderm into neuronal tissue. Proneural bHLH proteins control the differentiation into progenitor cells and their progression through the neurogenic program throughout the nervous system (Bertrand et al., 2002). MASH1, NeuroD, NeuroD2, MATH1-3, and Neurogenin 1-3 are bHLH transcription factors expressed during mammalian neuronal determination and differentiation (Johnson et al., 1990; Takebyashi et al., 1997; McCormick et al., 1996; Akazawa et al., 1995). Targeted disruptions of MASH1, Ngn1, Ngn2 or NeuroD in mice lead to the loss of specific subsets of neurons (Guillemot et al., 1993; Fode et al., 1998; Miyata et al., 1999).",
                        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,168 (Levesque et al.,) describes a method for converting or transdifferentiating epidermal basal cells into viable neurons. In one example, this method comprises the transfection of the epidermal cells with one or more expression vector(s) containing at least one cDNA encoding for a neurogenic transcription factor responsible for neural differentiation. Suitable cDNAs include: basic-helix-loop-helix activators, such as NeuroD1, NeuroD2, ASH1, and zinc-finger type activators, such as Zic3, and MyT1. The transfection step was followed by adding at least one antisense oligonucleotide known to suppress neuronal differentiation to the growth medium, such as the human MSX1 gene and/or the human HES1 gene (or non-human, homologous counterparts). Finally, the transfected cells were grown in the presence of a retinoid and a least one neurotrophin or cytokine, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), or neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). This technology yields 26% of neuronal cells; however, neither functionality nor stability of these cells was established. In addition, neural stem cells or neuroprogenitor cells are not produced according to this method.",
                        "A later process (Levesque et al., 2005; U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,380) mentions the conversion of the epidermal basal cell into a neural progenitor, neuronal, or glial cell by exposing the epidermal basal cell to an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and growing the cell in the presence of at least one antisense oligonucleotide comprising a segment of a MSX 1 gene and/or HES1 gene. However, there is no evidence or examples that any neural progenitors or glial cells were produced according to this method, let alone any details or evidence that morphological, physiological or immunological features of neuronal cells was achieved. In addition, since there is also no information on functionality, stability, expansion, and yield about the cells which may or may not have been produced, it is possible that these cells actually are skin-derived precursor cells (Fernandes et al., 2004) that have been differentiated into neuronal cells.",
                        "In view of the above, there is thus a need for stable, potent, and preferably autologouos neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells, neurons and glial cells, as well as other types of cells, stem cells and progenitor cells. There is also a need for methods that could result in true cell dedifferentiation and cell reprogramming.",
                        "The present invention addresses these needs and provides various types of stem-like and progenitor-like cells and cells derived or differentiated from these stem-like or progenitor-like cells, as well as methods that can result in true cell dedifferentiation and cell reprogramming.",

Such reprogrammed somatic cells can then be further treated with agents and/or cultured under conditions suitable for promoting reprogramming towards Neural Stem-Like Cells (NSLCs), and expansion of the NSLCs for the long-term. NSLCs according to the invention have the potential to differentiate to neuronal-like and/or glial-like cells, as well as neuronal and/or glial cells, for potential treatment of neurological diseases and injuries such as Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury. The methods described herein are also useful for producing histocompatible cells for cell therapy.",

Thus, the invention provides for neurological therapies to treat the disease or trauma of interest.",

                                "2) contacting the chromatin and/or DNA of a cell of a first type with a histone acetylator, an inhibitor of histone deacetylation, a DNA demethylator, and/or an inhibitor of DNA methylation; and increasing intracellular levels of at least one neural stem cell specific polypeptide driving directly or indirectly transformation of the cell of the first type into a NSLC.",
                                "In preferred embodiments, the step 1) comprises increasing intracellular levels of a MUSASHI1 polypeptide. As it will be explained hereinafter this can be achieved by different means including, but not limited to, transient expression of the MUSASHI1 polypeptide, preferably by transfecting an expression vector encoding the polypeptide.",
                                "In preferred embodiments, the step 2) comprises increasing intracellular levels of a MBD2 polypeptide or treating the cells with VPA and 5-AZA. As it will be explained hereinafter this can be achieved by different means including, but not limited to, transient expression of the MBD2 polypeptide, preferably by transfecting an expression vector encoding the polypeptide(s), and/or pre-treating and/or treating the cells with VPA and 5-AZA.",
                                "In one particular embodiment, reprogramming a cell of a first type to another type of cell that exhibits at least two selectable markers for neural stem cells requires transfecting the cell of a first type with one vector containing a cDNA encoding for a neurogenic transcription factor and one DNA demethylator. To enhance the de-differentiation the cells are exposed or pre-exposed to an agent(s) that inhibits DNA methylation, inhibits histone deacetylation, and/or disrupts the cell cytoskeleton. For example, the dedifferentiation can be enhanced by pre-treating the cells with an agent that disrupts the cell cytoskeleton followed by transfecting the cells with one or more vector(s) containing two neurogenic transcription factors in the presence of a DNA demethylator and/or inhibitor of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. The histone deacetylator, inhibitor of histone deacetylation, DNA demethylator, and/or an inhibitor of DNA methylation are as defined previously.",
                                "As defined previously, the method may further comprise a preliminary step of pre-treating the cell of a first type with a cytoskeleton disruptor, as defined previously, and/or culturing the cell in a media comprising one or more reprogramming factors appropriate for appearance and maintenance of the morphological and functional characteristics of NSLCs as defined previously (e.g. a retinoid compound, a neurotrophic factor, bFGF, EGF, SHH, Wnt 3a, neuropeptide Y, Estrogen). In some embodiment the method further comprises inhibiting cellular BMP signaling pathways (e.g. by NOGGIN, fetuin, or follistatin).",
                                "In preferred embodiments, generation of a NSLC from a first cell comprises the use of one or more reprogramming agents. Suitable agents include, but are not limited to, Musashi-1 (Msi1) and Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2). Other potential agents are listed in Table A and B.",
                                "The present invention is also directed to the use of DNA expression vectors encoding a protein or transcript which upregulates the expression of neurogenesis. The genetically-engineered DNA sequence, encoding a defined reprogramming agent such as Msi1 and Ngn2, can be introduced into cells by using a mono-, bi-, or poly-cistronic vectors. The expression of an endogenous multipotency gene indicates that the cDNA encodes a protein whose expression in the cell result directly or indirectly in the de-differentiation of the cell. The newly de-differentiated mammalian cells are capable of re-differentiating to neuronal lineages to regenerate said mammalian cells, tissues, and organs.",
                                "The present invention is further directed to a method for generating NSLCs by introducing a genetically-engineered DNA sequence into human somatic cells via transient transfection. Since the DNA introduced in the transfection process is not inserted into the nuclear genome, the foreign DNA decreases over time and when the cells undergo mitosis. Nonviral vectors remain in a non-replicative form, have low immunogenicity, and are easy and safe to prepare and to use. Furthermore, plasmids may accommodate large fragments of DNA.",
                                "In one particular embodiment, the method starts with obtaining cells from the individual, and reprogramming the cells in vitro to generate NSLCs. The significant aspect of the present invention is the stable reprogramming of a somatic cell or non-neuronal cell into a NSLC that can give rise to different types of,neuronal or glial cells (including neuronal-like or glial-like cells). These can then be implanted back into the same patient from which the cells were obtained, thus making an autologous treatment modality for many neurological conditions including neurotrauma, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease possible. These can also be implanted into a different individual from which the cells were obtained. Accordingly, the cells and methods of the present invention may be helpful to treat, prevent, or to stabilize a neurological disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury. This technology provides an ample source of neural stem cells, neuro-progenitor cells, neurons and glia for clinical treatment, which can be performed by implantation of NSLCs in vivo or inducing the differentiation in vitro and implantation of neuro-progenitor cells or specific neurons or glia in vivo.",
                                "In another embodiment, the method comprises isolating somatic or non-neuronal cells and exposing the cells to one or more agents that alter cell morphology and chromatin structure, and transfecting the cells with one or more genes containing at least one cDNA encoding for a neurogenic transcription factor. The gene transfection step may be replaced with alternative agents that induce the expression of the neurogenic transcription factor(s) in the cell. Inducing epigenetic modifications to DNA and histones (especially DNA demethylation and an open chromatic structure) facilitate true reprogramming of the cells. In another embodiment, the cells are incubated in a low oxygen environment, for example 5% O2, thereby helping in reprogramming the cells.",
                                "This methodology allows the reprogramming of a cell into a NSLC. The further course of development and the expansion of the reprogrammed cell depend on the in situ environment cues to which it is exposed. The embodiments of the invention further include growing the reprogrammed cell in an appropriate proliferation medium to expand the generated NSLC, for example Neural Progenitor proliferation Medium (StemCell Technologies) with the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), to promote the neural stem cell to proliferate.",
                                "The NSLCs obtained according to the invention can be differentiated into neuronal, astrocyte, and/or oligodendrocyte lineages in appropriate differentiation medium, for example NS-A differentiation medium (StemCell, Technologies) or NbActive medium (BrainBits\u2122) including a retinoid compound, such as all-trans-retinoic acid or vitamin A, and BDNF, to induce the differentiation of NSLCs towards neuronal and/or glial cells. Neuronal cells include cells that display one or more neural-specific morphological, physiological, functional and/or immunological features associated with a neuronal cell type. Useful criteria features includes: morphological features (e.g., long processes or neurites), physiological and/or immunological features such as expression of a set of neuronal-specific markers or antigens, synthesis of neurotransmitter(s) such as dopamine or gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and functional features such as ion channels or action potentials characteristic of neurons.",
                                "In accordance with the method, reprogrammed cells can be selected based on differential adherence properties as compared to untransfected cells; for example, reprogrammed cells can form floating neurospheres or grow well on laminin while untransfected fibroblasts attach and grow well on regular cell culture treated plates. Reprogrammed cells include cells that exhibit one or more neural stem specific markers and morphology and the loss of some or all of the specific markers related to the original cells. Furthermore, some of the functionality of the neural-like cells (NLCs) can be assessed at different time points by, for example, patch-clamping, immunostaining for synaptophysin and MAP2b, and by immunochemical means such as by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",
                                "In certain embodiments, the present invention provides NSLCs that are able to initiate and direct central nervous system regeneration at a site of tissue damage and can be customized for individual patients using their own cells as the donor or starting cell. The present invention can be used to generate cells from an individual patient, thus making autologous transplantations possible as a treatment modality for many neurological conditions. Thus, this technology eliminates the problems associated with transplantations of non-host cells, such as, immunological rejection and the risk of transmitted disease. The great advantage of the present invention is that it provides an essentially limitless supply for autologous grafts suitable for transplantation. Therefore, it will obviate some significant problems associated with current source of materials and methods of transplantation.",

                                "In certain embodiments, the invention concerns the use of polynucleotides, e.g. a polynucleotide encoding a MBD2 polypeptide, a MUSASHI1 polypeptide and/or a Ngn2 polypeptide. Means for introducing polynucleotides into a cell are well known in the art. Transfection methods of a cell such as nucleofection and/or lipofection, or other types of transfection methods may be used. For instance a polynucleotide encoding a desired polypeptide can be cloned into intermediate vectors for transfection in eukaryotic cells for replication and/or expression. Intermediate vectors for storage or manipulation of the nucleic acid or production of protein can be prokaryotic vectors, (e.g., plasmids), shuttle vectors, insect vectors, or viral vectors for example. A desired polypeptide can also be encoded by a fusion nucleic acid.",
                                "To obtain expression of a cloned nucleic acid, it is typically subcloned into an expression vector that contains a promoter to direct transcription. Suitable bacterial and eukaryotic promoters are well known in the art and described, e.g., in Sambrook and Russell (Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). The promoter used to direct expression of a nucleic acid of choice depends on the particular application. For example, a strong constitutive promoter is typically used for expression and purification. In contrast, when a dedifferentiation protein or compound is to be used in vivo, either a constitutive or an inducible promoter or compound is used, depending on the particular use of the protein. In addition, a weak promoter can be used, such as HSV TK or a promoter having similar activity. The promoter typically can also include elements that are responsive to transactivation, e.g., hypoxia response elements, Ga14 response elements, lac repressor response element, and small molecule control systems such as tet-regulated systems and the RU-486 system.",
                                "In addition to a promoter, an expression vector typically contains a transcription unit or expression cassette that contains additional elements required for the expression of the nucleic acid in host cells, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked, e.g., to the nucleic acid sequence, and signals required, e.g., for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, transcriptional termination, ribosome binding, and/or translation termination.

After the transfection with Msi1 or Ngn2 in the presence of MBD2, the expression of oligodendrocytes progenitors such as NKx2.2, olig2, and MAG and two markers for astrocytes (GFAP and AQP4) were highly increased. Also, several markers of early neuronal cells were enhanced after the transfection of HFF. TDLA data revealed a remarkable increase in specific markers for interneurons, such as somatostatin and calbindin1. The induction of Doublecortin (DCX), which is expressed by migrating immature cells during development, and acetylcholine (ACHE) mRNA, an early marker of neuronal cells, were highly expressed in the reprogrammed cells (Table 1). Transfection increased the expression of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 (DPYSL3), an early marker of newborn neurons, to fivefold with Msi1 and seven fold with Ngn2. Expression of Microtubule-Associated Protein 2 (MAP2), an essential marker for development and maintenance of early neuronal morphology and neuronal cell adhesion molecule, were highly expressed with Msi1 and Ngn2 (Table 1).

A slight increase of Sox2 positive cells (10.42\u00b110.27%) and nestin positive cells (4.85\u00b11.10%) was detected following transfection with one transcription factor Msi1 and MBD2. Same tendency of nestin and Sox2 positive cells was observed following transfection withNgn2 and MBD2. Disrupting the cell cytoskeleton with Cytochalasin B significantly enhanced reprogramming, but had no reprogramming effect on its own (Table 4).",
                                "Various DNA demethylators were tested as well for their effect on reprogramming efficiency. Cells were co-transfected with one vector (MSI1/NGN2) containing two neurogenic pCMV6-Msi1-Ngn2 factors with various DNA demethylators. Simultaneously another neurogenic factor was tested for its effect on cells de-differentiation towards NSCs, pCMV-XL-Nestin individually or in combination with pCMV-Msil-Ngn2, pCMV-XL5-Msi1, or pCMV-XL4-Ngn2 in the presence of MBD2 as previously described in Example II.",

Another assay was performed to assess the effect of nestin on the reprogramming efficiency; therefore cells were transfected with nestin individually or in combination with one vector containing one neurogenic factor (Msi1 or Ngn2) or both neurogenic factors in the presence of MBD2. Cells were cultured following transfection in the presence of proliferation medium supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml), FGF (20 ng/ml), and Noggin (20 ng/ml) with and without VPA (1 mM) treatment for 12 days at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2 and 5% O2.",

Transfecting cells with Msi1 and Ngn2 in the presence of various DNA demethylators revealed and confirm previous data showing that the among various DNA demethylators used in this study, MBD2 promotes the expression of neural stem genes (Sox2, GFAP, Nestin) as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, transfecting cells with nestin with and without the presence of one neurogenic factor had no effect on the reprogramming efficiency into neural stem-like cells. However co-transfection with nestin and Msi1/Ngn2/MBD2 enhanced the expression of neural stem cells genes and this increase was more pronounced in the presence of VPA.",
                                "Immunohistochemistry analysis performed in parallel with RT-PCR data indicated that positive Sox2 cells were undetectable when transfecting the cells with Msi1/Ngn2 in the presence of MBD1, MBD3, MBD4, MeCP1, or AICADA (Table 6) and that among the different types of DNA demethylator genes tested only MBD2 plays a significant positive role in the reprogramming efficiency of HFF towards NSLCs when using the above neurogenic genes. Immunohsitochemistry analysis revealed a small increase of immunopositive Sox2 cells (89.49\u00b13.18) after co-transfecting the cells with nestin and Msi1/Ngn2 in the presence of MBD2 (Table 6).",

The results in Table 8 indicate that all the genes related to neural stem cells (some of the significantly expressed pluripotency markers and mesendoderm markers are also expressed in neural stem cells) and the neural lineage were significantly expressed in NSLCs as opposed to HFFs, and the expression pattern was a bit different from hNPCs indicating that NSLCs are similar to, but not identical, to the hNPCs tested. Passage 5 NSLCs 5 had a higher expression of stemness genes than Passage 1 NSLCs. hNPCs had a higher expression of neuronally committed genes than NSLCs, indicting their neuroprogenitor status versus the greater stemness status of NSLCs.",
                                "In another part of the experiment, another batch of cells that were transfected with Msi1/Ngn2 +pCMV6-XL5-MBD2 were plated on Poly-Ornithine (30 min at RT) and Laminin (lh at RT) coated plates in CDM II medium in 5 different wells. On day 1, medium in two of the wells was switched to the same medium as in condition 1 a (Table 7) until day 12. Medium was changed daily until day 12, at which point it was switched to either NS-A Differentiation Medium (StemCell Technologies) or NbActive4 (BrainBitsTM) medium that were both supplemented with BDNF (20 ng/ml), NT-3 (20 ng/ml), NGF (20 ng/ml), Retinoic acid (5 \u03bcM), Noggin (20 ng/ml) and Forskolin (10 \u03bcM). These cells showed a typical neural stem-like cell morphology by day 7, and proliferated until day 12. During the exposure to either of the two differentiation media, these NSLC changed to a more neuronal and glial phenotype as shown in the bright field pictures (FIG. 21), but only expressed GFAP by Day 17 (FIG. 22).",
                                "For the other three wells, on day 1 medium was switched to either NS-A Differentiation Medium (StemCell Technologies), NbActive4 (BrainBits), or CDM II medium; these first two were supplemented with the same cytokines as previously described but with the addition of Fgf-2 (20 ng/ml). On day 12, Fgf-2 was removed from the first two differentiation media while cells in the CDM II medium were switched to the NS-A Differentiation Medium (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with cytokines without Fgf-2. Between day 12 and day 17, media was changed every two to three days. During the first 12 days of culture, cells in all 3 media developed into a mix of more spindle shaped cells compared to untransfected fibroblasts and some into cells with a NSLC morphology; upon removal of Fgf-2 cell morphology turned into a very pronounced neuronal shape as well as glial cells with a network established between cells as shown in the bright field pictures (FIG. 21) that expressed GFAP and \u00dfIII-tubulin by Day 17 (FIG. 22).",
                                "An additional study was designed to assess the effect of Msi1, Ngn2 and MBD2 on their endogenous proteins levels in reprogrammed cells. Cells were transfected with the MS11/NGN2 vector and MBD2 as previously described and cultured in proliferation condition at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Samples were collected at various time points from Day 2-10 and analyzed by RT-PCR to investigate the expression of endogenous genes and the expression of neural stem cell and neuronal genes at different time points. RT-PCR revealed a gradual loss of total Msi1, Ngn2 and MBD2 gene expression starting from Day 2 to Day 10, with the increase in MBD2 expression relative to control having been almost completely lost by Day 5. This decrease was associated with a significant activation of endogenous Msi1 and Ngn2 on Day 5, with another jump in endogenous gene expression at Day 9 (Table 9). A significant increase in Sox2 expression was detected at Day 4, and the expression of this ectoderm/neural stem cell/neuronal gene continued to increase with each subsequent timepoint (Table 10). GFAP (a neural stem cell and astrocyte marker) was slightly elevated already from Day 2 onwards, but significantly increased on Day 5 with a large jump in gene expression at Day 7 analysis timepoint and stayed at this expression level for the rest of the study period. Expression of the neural stem cell marker Nestin also started to slowly increase from Day 5 onwards. Expression of the neuronal genes \u03b2III-tubulin (TUBB3) and Map2b were slightly elevated already from Day 2 onwards, but significantly increased on Day 5 onwards. Expression of a marker for acetylcholine receptors (found in neurons), acetylcholine esterase (ACHE), was also slightly elevated from Day 2 onwards, but did not significantly increased until Day 7 onwards. It should be noted that among the neural stem cell markers that were analyzed, the relative expression of Sox2 was highly and early expressed which could then be directly or indirectly interact with the exogenous Msi/Ngn2 and/or other genes in the activation of Nestin, GFAP, and endogenous Msi1 and Ngn2 and other genes that promote the reprogramming and cell fate change, as well as the activation of neuronal genes like \u03b2III-tubulin (TUBB3), Map2b, and ACHE."

The HFFs were harvested with TrypLE\u2122 (Gibco), and 1\u00d7106 cells/transfection with the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II Device for 10 min at 90 g and 6\u00d7105 cells/transfection with the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae 96-well Shuttle\u00b0 Device for 5 min at 80\u00d7g. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was gently resuspended in either 100 \u03bcl of Basic Nucleofector\u2122 Solution for the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II or 20 \u03bcl of SE Solution (Cell line kit SE, Lonza) for the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae 96-well Shuttle\u00ae. For the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II Device, each 100 \u03bcl of cell suspension was combined with 2 different mixes of plasmid DNA (sample 1 was mixed with 2 \u03bcg of pCMV6-XL5-Msi1 and 2 \u03bcg pCMV6-XL5-MBD2, and sample 2 with 2 \u03bcg of Msi1/Ngn2 and 2 \u03bcg pCMV6-XL5-MBD2). Each cell suspension was transferred into an Amaxa certified cuvette and transfected with the appropriate program (U-023). Right after transfection, 900 \u03bcl of warm CDM1 medium was added to each cuvette and the sample was transferred into a culture plate coated with Laminin (Stemgent, 10 \u03bcg/ml) at a cell density of 1\u00d7105 to 1.5\u00d7105 cells per cm2 or into non-cell culture treated Petri dishes for neurosphere formation. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2 overnight. However for the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae 96-well Shuttle\u00ae Device, the steps described before were similar with the following exceptions: the cell suspension was mixed with 0.6 \u03bcg of each DNA of the same 2 DNA mixes, the cell suspension was transferred to a well of a 96-well Nucleoplate\u2122 (Lonza) and transfected with the program FF-130\u2122. After transfection, 80 \u03bcl of warm CDM1 medium was added to each well and the samples were left for 10 min in the incubator prior to being transferred into a laminin coated plate or non-cell culture treated Petri dishes at the same cell density as previously mentioned. For both devices, these steps were repeated for each sample that was transfected. Prior to transfection cells were cultured in CDM1 as described in Example I. After 24 hours, the medium was switched to a mix of 75% CDM medium and 25% Proliferation Medium which was supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml), FGF-2 (20 ng/ml), Noggin (20 ng/ml) and Cytochalasin B (10 \u03bcg/ml) and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2 and 5% O2. The medium was changed daily with an increased proportion of Neural proliferation medium up to 100% by Day 4 and a decreased proportion of Cytochalasin B that was completely omitted by Day 5. Forskolin (10 \u03bcM) was added to the medium from Day 4 onwards. The cells in floating conditions were pelleted by centrifugation and their medium changed daily as described for the adherent condition. Cells were collected at Day 3, 7, and 12 for imunohistochemistry analysis.",

This analysis revealed that in untransfected controls and at 3 days after transfection, no nuclear Sox2 staining was detectable. However, at Day 7 and Day 12 the percentage of Sox2 positive cells increased progressively under all transfection conditions except the pCMV6-XL5-Musashi and pCMV6-XL5-MBD2 Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II condition. The highest percentage at Day 12 was obtained with Msi1/Ngn2 and pCMV6-XL5-MBD2 transfected with the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae 96-well Shuttle\u00ae Device (\u02dc80%). The same combination transfected with the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II yielded only \u02dc35% positive cells. The pCMV6-XL5-Musashi and pCMV6-XL5-MBD2 with the Shuttle\u00ae produced \u02dc20% positive cells, while generally none were observed with the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II. The percentage of positive cells varied strongly between wells. The staining indicated that the cell population was not homogenous, since fields of densely arranged Sox2 positive cells and complete fields with only negative cells could be found in all cases. In general the Shuttle\u00b0 was initially more toxic to cells than the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II, however at least in the case of Msi1/Ngn2 and pCMV6-XL5-MBD2 shuttle, the Sox2 positive population rapidly expanded from Day 7 to Day 12 to have twice as many Sox2 positive cells as compared to the Nucleofector\u2122\u00ae II. The cells in floating conditions did not form spheres during the 12 day experiment in any of the conditions, suggesting that the formation of neurospheres requires either the generation of neural stem-like cells in adherent conditions first or more time.",

The latter had the advantages of requiring a smaller starting material (less cells and less DNA required) and in addition gave rise to a higher number of Sox2 positive cells. Moreover a very small population of Sox2 positive cells was observed with the Shuttle\u00ae Device only upon transfection with only one neurogenic transcription factor (Msi) in the presence of the DNA demethylator MBD2."

                                "Based on previous studies showing that greater proportional reprogramming is achieved by transfecting two neurogenic genes, this study was designed to evaluate the number of reprogramming cells by using the vector Msi1/Ngn2, containing two neurogenic transcription factors (Msi1 and Ngn2) and the role of DNA demethylator or DNA methylation inhibitor (5-azacytidine) and histone deacetylation inhibitor (VPA) in the reprogramming process.",
                                "HFFs were cultured and treated with cytochalasin B as described in Example III, and treated simultaneously with VPA (1 mM) and 5-Azacytidine (0.5 \u03bcM). After two days of treatment, cells were transfected by Nucleofection as described in Example II with the constructed vector Msi1/Ngn2. After preparing the cells, they were mixed with 2 \u03bcg of total DNA (Msi1/Ngn2) and cells that had not been treated with chemical inhibitors (VPA and 5-Aza) were co-transfect with MBD2 (2\u03bcg), using the appropriate program (U023). The samples were transferred into a coated culture plate with Laminin (10 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma) and incubated in a humidified 37\u00b0 C./5% O2/5% CO2 incubator. The medium was changed to the proliferation basal media, Neural Proliferation Medium (NeuroCult\u2122 proliferation Kit, StemCell Technologies), with the presence of Noggin (20 ng/ml, Peprotech), recombinant hFGF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech), and recombinant hEGF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech). Following 6 days of transfection, cells were harvested using Accutase\u2122 (Millipore), centrifuged (300\u00d7g, 5 min, RT) and plated in uncoated cell culture dishes in NeuroCult\u2122 NSC Proliferation medium to investigate the capacity to grow cells in suspension as neurospheres or on Laminin coated-plates for adherent culture. To prevent loss of floating spheres during media changes, cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 150\u00d7g for 3 min at room temperature (RT). The pellet was then resuspended in fresh medium and plated into new uncoated, low-bind cell culture dishes. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2, 5% O2 and were fed daily for at least two months.",
                                "To investigate whether a single cell from human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) and human NSLCs was able to generate a neurosphere (a standard test for proving that a cell is a neural stem cell), neurospheres were dissociated into single cells and these single cells were isolated and cultured in proliferation medium in suspension, and neurosphere formation was monitored by taking bright field images using light microscope (Nikon, 10\u00d7) and by Cellomics\u2122. These cells started to proliferate and grew as spheres starting day 6 to day 10 (FIG. 4A). Immunohistochemistry analysis of these spheres (Table 12 and FIG. 4) on Day 20, revealed immunopositive staining for the neural stem cells markers Sox2, Musashi, CD133, Nestin, and GFAP. Cells also stained positive for 13111-tubulin (a marker for neurons), O4 (a marker for oligodendrocytes), and GFAP (a marker for astrocytes), indicating the tri-potent differentiation potential of both sets of cells (NSLC and hNPC), and negative for NGFrec and NeuN (markers for differentiated neurons) indicating that the cells were not terminally differentiated.",
                                "HFF cells were cultured as described in Example I, and transfected using the Nucleofector\u2122 II device (Lonza) as described in Example II. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV6-XL5-Msi/pCMV6-XL4-Ngn2, pCMV-Msi1 -Ngn2 with MBD2 or pre-treated with VPA/5aza. Cells were cultured in proliferation medium as suspension or adherent cultures. Gene expression analysis on 8 samples was performed as previously described in Example I with the customized Neuronal Markers 2 TLDA (Table 13) which profiled the expression of 48 genes (including three housekeeping genes: ACTIN, GAPDH and PPIA) in four major categories; 1) fibroblast specific genes; 2) neuronal lineage specific genes; 3) Neural stem cell marker specific genes; and 4) Genes for growth factors and their receptors.",
                                "**Sample Information**",
                                "As shown in Table 14, fibroblast-specific genes (Col3A1, Lox, S100A4) were down-regulated in reprogrammed cells, indicating the loss of fibroblast-specific genes following transfection (note that not all cells got transfected and reprogrammed, so the presence of fibroblast-specific gene expression in the cultures is mostly from the un-programmed fibroblasts left in the culture). The expression of these genes is observed to increase when HFFs were transfected in the absence of DNA demethylator or the DNA methylation inhibitor, indicating that down-regulation of differentiated markers of fibroblast cells requires DNA demethylation. The expression of ectoderm genes such as Msi1, Sox2, and Nestin was remarkably increased following transfection in conjunction with DNA demethylation. The expression of neuronal markers, such as synaptogamin1 (a synaptic vesicle protein) and NeuroD1 was up-regulated in transfected cells with Msi1/Ngn2/MBD2, and slightly increased in transfected cells with Msi1/Ngn2/VPA and 5-AZA. The selected three markers of oligodendrocytes were detected in the transfected cells with a strong increase of Olig2. Two markers for astrocytes, GFAP and ALDH1L1, were enhanced following transfection. The results support the idea that neurospheres are composed of heterogeneous progenitor subtypes.",
                                "Among the neurotrophic factors, expression of CNTF was slightly increased in the reprogrammed cells. The expression of GAP-43 and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were the most annotated genes. GAP-43 has long been acknowledged to play a pivotal role in axonal plasticity and is used as a marker of regenerating neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, both in embryonic development and in neuronal regeneration in injured brain and spinal cord. Expression of receptors for growth and neurotrophic factors was increased, such as neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase expression.",
                                "Further analysis and quantification of the adherent population of NSLCs showed that cells were positively stained for Sox2 (93.43\u00b11.9%), nestin (60.76\u00b15.7%), and GABA (37.48\u00b14.9), while these markers were undetectable in untransfected cells (FIG. 5, Table 15). Furthermore, these cells stained positive for p75NTR (31.15\u00b11.6), \u03b2III-tubulin (37.55\u00b10.6%) and GFAP (16.47\u00b10.9). However, untransfected HFFs only stained positive for HFF markers (FIG. 5), such as fibronectin and fibroblast protein marker, while these markers were undetectable in reprogrammed cells, demonstrating that the reprogrammed cells lost markers of the original cells and adopted morphology and markers of neural stem cells and a neuronal lineage.",
                                "This study showed as well that NSLCs have the capacity to proliferate in culture and exhibit stable morphology, gene and protein expression that were maintained for the entire study period, which was for over five month in culture (Table 16).",
                                "**Gene Expression Microarray**",
                                "Microarray expression analysis was performed to get a global overview to compare the gene expression profile of passage 7 NSLC to both HFF (the cells that the NSLC were created from) and hNPCs. NSLC (n=3), HFF (n=2), and hNPC (n=3) were resuspended in RNAlater\u2122 (Qiagen) and shipped to Genotypics (India) where the samples were processed and the Gene Expression Microarray was performed.",
                                "In brief, Genotypics extracted RNA from the samples and performed Quality Control using an Agilent Bioanalyzer\u2122. Labelling was done using Agilent's Quick Amp\u2122 kit (cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription), followed by Labelling QC. Hybridization was then performed using the 8\u00d760K array, and scanning was done using high throughput Agilent scanner with SureScan\u2122 technology. The Agilent Feature Extraction software was used for automated feature extraction, followed by Raw Data QC and Image QC. Advanced Data Analysis was then performed, including Pathway and Gene Ontology analyisis using Agilent's GeneSpring GXTM v10.0 and Genotypic's Biointerpreter Software. The NSLC samples were compared to the HFF samples (Set 1) and hNPC samples (Set 2) The NSLC samples had a global gene expression pattern that was much closer to the hNPCs than the HFFs from which the NSLCs were created (FIG. 23). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that NSLCs are closely related to hNPCs, including in terms of neuronal lineage markers, regenerative genes and migration genes. These data confirm that NSLCs are similar, but not identical, to hNPCs.",
                                "Microarray analysis revealed an up-regulation of neural precursor genes in the NSLC samples as compared to the HFF samples. ACTL6A and PHF10, which both belong to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodelling complex (npbaf complex) and are required for the proliferation of neural progenitors, were up-regulated by 2.9-fold and 2.3 fold respectively. MSI2, which plays a role in the proliferation and maintenance of stem cells in the central nervous system, was up-regulated by 6-fold (Table X1). Glia genes were up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the HFF samples. GFAP, is a neural stem cell- and astrocyte-specific marker that, during the development of the central nervous system, distinguishes astrocytes from other glial cells, is highly up-regulated in the NSLC sample as compared to HFF (690-fold). OLIG1, which promotes formation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, especially within the brain, is also highly up-regulated in NSLC sample as compared to HFF (370-fold) (Table X2).",
                                "Table X3 lists a subset of regenerative genes that are up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the HFF samples. SOX2, a gene critical for early embryogenesis and for embryonic stem cell pluripotency as well as neural stem cells, is highly up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the HFF samples (5000-fold). CCND2, which is essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S (start) transition, is also up-regulated in NSLC samples (70-fold as compared to HFF samples). As shown in Table X4, numerous fibroblast genes were down-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the HFF samples. This shows that the NSLC lose the expression of numerous fibroblast genes as it gets reprogrammed from HFF to NSLC.",
                                "Table X5 show that neural precursor genes were also up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the hNPC samples. BDNF, which promotes the survival and differentiation of selected neuronal populations of the peripheral and central nervous systems during development, is even more highly expressed in NSLC samples than in hNPC samples (34-fold up-regulation). Table X6 shows that a subset of Glia genes are also up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the hNPC samples. GFAP, a neural stem cell- and astrocyte-specific marker that, during the development of the central nervous system, distinguishes astrocytes from other glial cells, is more highly expressed in NSLC samples than hNPC samples (13-fold). PLP1, the major myelin protein of the central nervous system which plays an important role in the formation or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin, is also more highly expressed in NSLC samples than in hNPC samples (20-fold).",
                                "Regenerative genes were also up-regulated in the NSLC samples as compared to the hNPC samples (Table X7). BMP2, a neural crest marker, but which induces growth especially of cartilage and bone formation and BMP4, which in turn induces cartilage and bone formation and acts in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation and fracture repair, but also in neural stem cells, were both more highly expressed in NSLC samples than in hNPC samples (18-fold and 20-fold respectively). GAP43, which is a major component of the motile growth cones that form the tips of elongating axons was more highly expressed in NSLC samples than hNPC samples (4-fold). This suggests the regenerative potential of NSLC. HOXB4, a transcription factor that is involved in development and also in the expansion of neural stem cells as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro making it a potential candidate for therapeutic stem cell expansion, was also more highly expressed in NSLCs than in hNPCs. This data indicates that NSLCs are more \u2018stem-like\u2019 or have more \u2018sternness\u2019 than hNPCs.",
                                "In order to investigate the differentiation potential of NSLCs to neuronal lineages (Neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendocytes), neurospheres were dissociated and plated in laminin/poly-D-Lysine (10 m/ml; Sigma) in differentiation medium for two weeks. The differentiation towards neuronal lineage was performed using two different mediums: NbActive medium (BrainBits\u2122) supplemented with Brain Derived Neurotrophin Factor (BDNF, 20 ng/ml, Peprotech), all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA, 5 \u03bcM, Spectrum), and bFGF (40 ng/ml, Peprotech) or NeuroCult\u2122 differentiation medium (NeuroCult\u2122 Differentiation kit, StemCell Technologies), supplemented with BDNF (20 ng/ml, Peprotech) and bFGF (40 ng/ml, Peprotech). After two weeks in culture, the cells were stained with the neuronal marker \u03b2III-tubulin, astrocyte markers GFAP and S100\u03b2, andoligodendrocyte marker CNPase. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and the primary antibodies were added in 5% normal goat serum/PBS as follows: Mouse antibody \u03b2III-tubulin (1:200, Abcam), rabbit antibody S100\u03b2 (1:100, Abcam), and Chicken antibody CNPase (1:50, Abcam). Secondary antibodies are added in 5% normal goat serum/PBS as follows: Goat anti mouse Alexa546\u2122 (1:200, Invitrogen), Goat anti rabbit Alexa488\u2122 (1:200, Invitrogen), and Goat anti-chicken cy5 (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs).",
                                "Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that NbActive medium promoted the differentiation equally to neuronal (48.66\u00b114.07%, \u03b2III-tubulin) and potential early oligodendrocyte lineages (50.01\u00b14.04%, CNPase) and to a lower percentage of astrocyte cells (2.68\u00b11.13%, sloop), while NS-A differentiation medium induced the differentiation mainly to neurons (64.89\u00b14.11%, \u03b2III-tubulin) and astrocytes (35.94\u00b14.04%, S100beta), and a low percentage of potential early oligodendrocytes cells (8.68\u00b12.71%, CNPase) . The NSC-A medium was selected over NbActive for further differentiation studies. Differentiation of cells in NS-A differentiation medium promote the differentiation of hNPC and NSLC similarly as shown in Table 17 by the decrease of the percentage of sox2, musashi and nestin positive cells. NSLCs were differentiated to neuronal (74.3\u00b10.1, GABA), astrocyte lineage (65.6\u00b10.0, S100beta) and to a lower percentage of oligodendrocyte cells (5.2\u00b10.6, CNPase). The same pattern of tripotent lineage differentiation was observed with hNPCs (Table 17).",
                                "Several additional antibodies to neuronal antigens were used to characterize, in more detail, the nature of differentiated cells. Antibodies against microtubule-associated protein (MAP2b), NCAM, and synaptophysin were used as recommended by the antibody manufacturer. After three weeks in differentiation medium, there was a differentiation-induced reduction in markers of precursors cells and an increase in mature neuronal markers. The percentage of neural precursor markers such as Sox2 were decreased during differentiation, while p75NTR, \u03b2III-tubulin and GABA were increased with lengthening differentiation time (FIG. 6); however, O4 positive cells were very low after 3 weeks of differentiation of hNPCs (6.4\u00b12.9) and NSLCs (8.2\u00b10.6). Synaptophysin, an antibody used to identify functional neuronal cells, was increased following 2 and 3 weeks of differentiation, indicating maturity of the neuronal cells. GABA and acetycholine markers were increased following 2 weeks of differentiation and decreased at week 3.",
                                "The morphological changes and expression of a number of neuronal antigens and genes show that the above method results in normal and viable neuronal cells. Additionally, the newly formed neuronal cells have the morphological criteria of neurons. In addition to the above markers, the differentiated cells were evaluated by characterizing morphological markers of neurite differentiation. Neuron type cells (cells strongly expressing \u03b2III-tubulin) showed neurite formation after differentiation,, including an increase in the average number of neurites per neuron (from e.g. 1.38\u00b10.1) The same pattern was observed in \u03b2III-tubulin positive cells. Accordingly, the average neurite length (118.3\u00b13.5 \u03bcm) and the number of branch points (3.28\u00b10.3) per neuron also increased. The differentiated neuron-like cells developed long neurites that were greater than three cell diameters in length with a growth cone at the end, expressed neuron-specific genes, and stopped proliferating after the induction of differentiation.",
                                "Further differentiation was performed using an optimised medium that promoted the differentiation towards oligodendrocyte lineage. NSLCs and hNPCs were cultured in NS-A differentiation medium as described previously supplemented with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech) and sonic hedgehog (SHH, 100 ng/ml, Peprotech) for 4 days. After 4 days medium was changed to NS-A differentiation medium supplemented by T3 (60 ng/ml, Peprotech), IGF1 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech), NT-3 (10 ng/ml, Peprotech), and PDGF (10 ng/ml, Peprotech). Cells were cultured for 20 days at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2.",
                                "Quantification of the differentiation of hNPCs and NSLCs revealed a population of cells that were positively stained for O4. As shown in Table 18, the percentage of O4 positive cells was more pronounced in differentiated hNPC (40.1\u00b16.4%) as compared to differentiated NSLCs (8.5\u00b10.6%) when using the above differentiation protocol.",
                                "This study showed that transfecting the cells with one or two neurogenic transcription factors in the presence of a DNA demethylator or small molecules for epigenetic modification achieves stable reprogrammed cells (NSLCs). Like a DNA demethylator, epigenetic modification (inhibition of acetylation and methylation) are sometimes useful in boosting the reprogramming process. These cells possess and retain neural stem cell properties as determined by: (1) the expression of neural stem cell genes and proteins, (2) the capacity to generate and grow as neurospheres starting from a single cell, and (3) to differentiate to neuronal lineages in differentiation conditions. When differentiated to neurons, cells display one or more neural-specific morphological, physiological and/or immunological features associated with a neuronal cell type. Useful criteria include morphological features (long processes or neurites), physiological, and/or immunological features such as expression of a set of neuronal-specific markers or antigens. Furthermore, NSLCs readily turn into a tripotent-like precursor cell with differentiation potential to a high percentage of neuronal, astrocytes and lower percentage of oligodendrocyte populations."

These cells are capable of proliferating in response to EGF and bFGF and express nestin, versican and fibronectin, and can differentiate into both neuronal and mesodermal progeny. In order to verify that NSLCs are distinct from SKPs, differentiation towards adipocyte cells was performed. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) were maintained in StemPro\u2122 MSC serum free medium (Invitrogen) on flasks coated with CellStart\u2122 (Invitrogen). CellStart\u2122 was diluted 1:100 in dPBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and the flask incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Cells are passaged every 3 to 4 days using Accutase\u2122 and medium was changed every 2 days. Three to four days before initiating differentiation, ADSCs and NSLCs were seeded in 6-wellplates in CellStart\u2122 (1:100 in dPBS/Ca2+/Mg2+/2 hours at 37\u00b0 C.) coated tissue culture plates.

Three days after, IBMX and dexamethasone were withdrawn from the differentiation medium. At day 10, cells were fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 min and stained with Oil Red O (Invitrogen) staining solution for 15 min. Staining was removed and cells washed twice with PBS. Adipose cells appeared red with lipid droplets specifically stained with Oil Red O, however NSLCs were stained negative, with no presence of lipid droplets in the cells, and the cells adopted neuronal cell morphology.",

Conditioned medium from each group was collected, centrifuged, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until assaying.

The following day, all wells were washed with TBS-Tween\u2122 0.5% before incubation with Block/Sample buffer 1\u00d7 at room temperature for one hour without shaking. After blocking, standards and samples were added to the plates and incubated and shaken (450\u00b1100 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, after washing with TBS-Tween\u2122 wash buffer, plates were incubated for 2 h with Anti-Human BDNF pAb (1:500 dilution in Block & Sample 1\u00d7 Buffer) at 4\u00b0 C.

Then, plates were washed five times with TBS-Tween\u2122 0.5% wash buffer and 100 \u03bcl of TMB One Solution was added to each well. Following 10 minutes incubation at room temperature with shaking (450\u00b1100rpm) for the BDNF plate, a blue color formed in the wells. After stopping the reaction by adding 100 \u03bcl of 1N hydrochloric acid, the absorbance was read at 450 nm on a microplate reader (Synergy 4\u2122) within 30 minutes of stopping the reactions.

This data shows that different types of NSLCs with different gene expression profiles (and characteristics) can be created from different types of starting/source cells (and the same has been observed for creating some other types of stem-like cells discussed in this application). The data is also intriguing since it was not expected that keratinocytes (which are derived from the ectoderm just as endogenous neural stem cells) would have a lower expression than HFFs for all the genes analyzed except for Nestin (it was expected that keratinocytes would be the easiest to reprogram into NSLCs since they are derived from the ectoderm).",

Similarly to hNPCs, NSLCs created from from keratinocytes, CD34+ cells, and HFFs had a tendency to differentiate more towards an astrocyte lineage than a neuronal lineage (except NSLCs created from HFFs had an almost similar number of \u03b2III-tubulin positive and GFAP positive cells) as shown by the high percentage of GFAP positive cells during differentiation, which was confirmed by S100beta staining. However, the proportion of astrocyte and neuronal cells generated from hNPCs was lower in same culture conditions, indicating that NSLCs generated from HFF, Keratinocytes, and CD34+ cells can give rise to a higher number of neuronal and astrocyte cells as compared to hNPCs. NSLCs, whether created from HFFs, Keratinocytes or CD34+ cells (or potentially even some other cell), are tripotent cells and possess the capacity to differentiate to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes similarly to hNPCs. However, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis of transfected ADSCs did not reveal any significant expression of neural stem cell genes, indicating a need to optimize conditions for turning ADSCs to NSLCs or to investigate the effect of others neurogenic factors that could turn these into NSLCs.",

No clear morphology change of the cells was observed within the CDM and the immunohistochemical analysis failed to detect \u03b2III-tubulin positive cells.

Also levels of GFAP mRNA was enhanced time dependently by approximately 14 times. Likewise, the same pattern was observed in Ngn2 transfected cells. While expression of \u03b2III-tubulin and MAP2b were modestly increased following transfection with one neurogenic transcription factors the regulation of gene expression after transfecting the cells with two neurogenic factors, Msi1 or Ngn2 with Pax6, did not further increase the expression of neuronal genes.

Two markers for astrocytes (GFAP and AQP4) were highly expressed after transfection with Msi1 and Ngn2 in the presence of the DNA demethylator MBD2. Interestingly, several markers of early neuronal cells were enhanced; 12 days after transfection, TDLA data revealed increases in specific markers for interneurons, such as somatostatin and calbindin1. Doublecortin (DCX), which is expressed by migrating immature cells during development, and acetylcholine (ACHE), an early marker of neuronal cells, were highly expressed in reprogrammed cells (Table 26). Transfection with Msi1 or Ngn2 increased the expression of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 (DPYSL3), an early marker of newborn neurons to five-fold with Msi1 and seven-fold with Ngn2. Expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), an essential marker for development and maintenance of early neuronal morphology, and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) were highly expressed with Msi1 and Ngn2. The expression of enolase-2, a marker of mature neurons, was 20-fold enhanced by Msi1 and Ngn2. Member of the NeuroD family NeuroD1 was highly expressed after transfection with Msi1 to 84.22 fold and to 34.27 by Ngn2.

There were a few weak and identical bands that appeared in the restriction enzyme digested genomic DNA from HFF, NSLC samples #1 and #2, suggesting that there is no plasmid DNA integration in the genomic DNA of NSLCs. These bands may represent the endogenous Ngn2 gene since the 1.2 kb Dig-labeled PCR probe contains a small part of the Ngn2 gene.

A midline cranial incision was performed with a sterile surgical scalpel blade, the cranial vault exposed and the bregma identified. The skull above the sensorimotor cortex was opened and the sensorimotor cortex area [0.5-4.0 mm caudal to bregma and 1.8-3.8 mm lateral to the midline (Paxinos and Watson 1986)] was carefully aspirated. After ablation, the treatments (Alginate , Alginate+hNPC, Alginate+NSLCs, RMx+NSLCs, RMx Only, Fibrin Gel, or Saline) were applied directly on the brain after ablation. The opening in the skull was then filled with Bone Wax. In case of a bleeding, small pieces of sterile homeostatic tissue were inserted into the lesion in order to stop the bleeding. The sutures were performed using Ethicon\u2122 monofilament suture 1/2 circle needle shape. Surgeries were performed in sterile clean rooms, and topical antibiotics (Cicatrin\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline) were applied to the exposed skull and scalp to limit local infection. Rats were immunosuppressed by daily injection i.p. of cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg/day) starting the day before the surgery until the end of the study period. The purpose of the cyclosporine A injection was to reduce the rat's immune reaction to the treatment. The immune-suppression was sustained until the end of the study to ensure that any potential failure of regeneration (if taken place) was not due to the immune reaction against the treatment. Functional scores were performed weekly, in all groups, sensorimotor impairment was evaluated based on the behavioural tests as described below.",
