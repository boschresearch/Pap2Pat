                        "RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a phenomenon in which the decomposition of mRNA of a target gene is selectively induced or the expression of the target gene is inhibited by introducing double-stranded RNA, which consists of sense RNA and antisense RNA with a complementary sequence thereto, to cells, etc. RNAi was first discovered in C. elegans, but it is now observed as a very well-preserved life phenomenon in various kinds of animals, plants, microorganisms (e.g., yeast), insects, etc.",
                        "Small interference RNA (siRNA), which is an RNAi-inducing material, refers to a short double-helix RNA strand consisting of about 20 to 30 nucleotides. Once an siRNA is injected into a cell, it targets an mRNA with a complementary nucleotide sequence thereto and thereby inhibits the expression of the corresponding gene. siRNAs have an effect of treating diseases, and are attracting attention as an effective method to control life processes being targeted, due to their easy preparation method and high target selectivity.",
                        "Currently, the diseases that can be treated using siRNAs under study include cancer, viral infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, etc., and as a clinical trial, the potential of siRNAs for treatment of senile macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus infection was reported (Melnikova I. Nat Rev Drug Discov 2007, 6, 863 to 864). Additionally, it was reported that the siRNA delivery system can be employed in human cancer treatment using a cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle polymer targeting transferrin (Oh YK. et al., Adv Drug Deliver Rev 2009, 61, 850 to 862).",
                        "However, gene silencing using synthetic siRNAs has a problem in that they have a very short duration of 2 to 4 days, and this is because siRNAs are easily degraded by various nucleases in the cytoplasm and the siRNA concentration is diluted when cell division occurs.",
                        "Due to the short duration, there are problems in that not only is frequent injection of synthetic siRNAs required, but also, the efficiency is too low to perform gene silencing of target proteins with a long half-life due to the short duration, and these limitations slow the development of therapeutic agents using siRNAs.",
                        "Conventionally, in an effort to improve the duration of gene silencing, attempts were made to deliver as many siRNAs as possible by increasing the loading efficiency of siRNAs using various kinds of transporters. For example, transporters such as Lipofectin\u00ae, Lipofectamine\u00ae, Cellfectin\u00ae, cationic phospholipid nanoparticles, cationic polymers, or liposome-based transporters have mainly been used. However, transporters using cationic molecules or synthetic polymers had problems in that they have low transport efficiency into cells and have cytotoxicity that may be induced during gene transfer into cells. Additionally, in the case of viral vectors capable of exhibiting a long duration of gene silencing, they had problems in that in vivo stability cannot be guaranteed because of immunological side-effects caused by the immunogenicity of the surface protein of these viral vectors, despite their excellent duration. Above all, due to the risk of introducing an exogenous gene into the patient's genome, the application of gene silencing to the human body using a virus has been limited.",
                        "Meanwhile, in an effort to improve the duration of gene silencing, plasmid DNA capable of shRNA expression based on a nucleus-dependent promoter has been developed. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters derived from U6 small nuclear RNA and H1 RNA genes are predominantly used, and the shRNA expression in the nucleus using such a nucleus-dependent promoter provides an effective method for long-term production of shRNAs. However, such a plasmid DNA method relying on cell membrane permeability, where the efficiency is known to be as low as 1%, unlike nuclear membrane permeability, has very low efficiency of gene silencing. In particular, the application of plasmid DNA in vivo is limited, as it has very low transfer efficiency in vivo. Additionally, in the case of highly-concentrated shRNAs expressed in the nucleus, they can be converted by a dicer, etc. to mature siRNAs, which can participate in gene silencing, only when they are released into the cytoplasm. However, these exportin-5 transporters involved in the release of shRNAs into the cytoplasm are problematic because they become saturated by highly-concentrated shRNAs, thereby preventing even the release of microRNAs involved in other cellular functions. The problem of the release of microRNAs into the cytoplasm results in serious toxicity. In addition, although methods for nucleus-dependent shRNA expression using various plasmid DNAs have been known, the in vivo model still has limitations due to short duration.",
                        "Under the circumstances, the present inventors have made efforts to develop a composition capable of maintaining sustained shRNA expression in the cytoplasm in a nucleus-independent manner. As a result, they have discovered that a composition containing an mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase, plasmid DNA for self-amplification of the T7 RNA polymerase, and a DNA fragment encoding a gene expression inhibitor; and a transporter including the composition can sustain long-term expression of shRNAs in the cytoplasm, and in particular, that they can inhibit the expression of a target gene in a cancer tissue-specific manner, thereby completing the present invention."

Meanwhile, each of the explanations and exemplary embodiments disclosed herein can be applied to other explanations and exemplary embodiments. That is, all of the combinations of various factors disclosed herein belong to the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the scope of the present invention should not be limited by the specific disclosure provided hereinbelow.",
                                "To achieve the above objects, an aspect of the present invention provides a composition for sustained inhibition of gene expression, containing an mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase, plasmid DNA for self-amplification of the T7 RNA polymerase, and a DNA fragment encoding a gene expression inhibitor.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cT7 RNA polymerase\u201d refers to an RNA polymerase derived from the T7 bacteriophage that recognizes a promoter sequence unique to phage consisting of about 20 base pairs that catalyzes the synthesis of DNA from RNA in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. T7 RNA polymerase has very high specificity for promoters and can only transcribe DNA downstream of the T7 promoter. Therefore, in the present invention, T7 RNA polymerase can bind and transcribe to the plasmid DNA having only the T7 promoter without reacting with other promoters in the cell, and can self-amplify the T7 RNA polymerase itself with high efficiency. Specifically, unlike eukaryotic RNA polymerase, which requires various intracellular cofactors, T7 RNA polymerase has the advantage of being able to induce transcription without an additional intracellular cofactor (M. Chamberlin, J. McGrath, L. Waskell, New RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T7, Nature 228 (1970) 227 to 231). Additionally, due to the absence of other RNA polymerase having specificity for the T7 promoter in the eukaryotic cell, the transcription system using the T7 promoter/T7 RNA polymerase is not interrupted by other transcription systems within the cell, and it does not interfere with other transcription systems. Meanwhile, since other promoters belonging to the same type of RNA polymerase III as T7 promoter (e.g., U1 promoter, H1 promoter, etc.) are already present in the cell, they do not have the above characteristic of not causing interference possessed by the T7 promoter, and the present invention is thus not suitable for controlling transcription on the transcription system. More specifically, the mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase of the present invention may consist of a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, but the mRNA fragment sequence is not limited thereto.",
                                "Additionally, the mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase of the present invention may further include a 5\u2032-cap structure. The 5\u2032-cap structure refers to 7-methylguanosine present at the 5\u2032-terminus of mRNAs of most eukaryotic cells and viruses, and it prevents the degradation of mRNA by ribonuclease (RNase) and may act as a ribosome binding site by binding to a translation initiation factor in the cytoplasm. Generally, cytoplasmic transcripts do not have the 5\u2032-cap structure essentially possessed by nuclear transcripts, and thus they have a problem in that the translation efficiency by ribosome is decreased. As such, the present invention is characterized in that it uses the mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase, and thereby, not only are intracellular stability and cytoplasmic translation efficiency increased, but also the limitations of the low nuclear membrane permeability of the plasmid DNA, which was previously used for the nucleus-dependent shRNA expression, are overcome, thereby allowing the initial T7 RNA polymerase to be effectively provided in the cytoplasm.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, for the synthesis of T7 polymerase mRNA having a 5 \u2018-cap structure, the dsDNA fragments having the sequence of the T7 promoter-T7 polymerase were first synthesized by a chemical synthesis method (Bioneer Corp, Korea), and for the T7 promoter-T7 polymerase DNA fragment, T7 polymerase mRNA having a 5\u2032-cap structure was synthesized in vitro using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB).",
                                "In the present invention, the plasmid DNA is characterized in that T7 RNA polymerase is self-amplified in the cytoplasm by repetition of the expression loop of T7 RNA polymerase. Specifically, the plasmid DNA may consist of a T7 promoter, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) domain, a gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase, a poly A tail, and a T7 termination sequence, which are operably linked. The IRES domain incorporated into the plasmid DNA may be a viral IRES, and can not only increase transcription stability of the plasmid DNA by producing an IRES-fused T7 polymerase transcript, but can also improve the low expression efficiency of T7 polymerase in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the T7 promoter may be comprised of a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, the IRES domain may be comprised of a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, the gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase may be comprised of a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, and the T7 termination sequence may be comprised a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, but these are not limited thereto.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, T7 polymerase gene (GenBank Accession No. FJ881694.1) was inserted into the BamHI/XhoI restriction sites in the multi-cloning sites of the pT7CFE1-NHis plasmid (Thermo Fisher), and thereby a plasmid DNA (auto_T7pol plasmid) for self-amplification of T7 RNA polymerase was prepared, in which the T7 RNA polymerase gene was located downstream of the T7 promoter and the viral IRES domain while being simultaneously located upstream of the poly A tail and the T7 termination sequence.",
                                "As used herein, the \u201cself-amplification\u201d may be performed by the expression loop of T7 RNA polymerase due to the mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase and plasmid DNA for self-amplification of the T7 RNA polymerase contained in the composition of the present invention. Specifically, the mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase is translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm to produce T7 RNA polymerase, and the produced T7 RNA polymerase recognizes the T7 promoter present in the plasmid DNA and performs transcription of T7 RNA polymerase. Then, the produced mRNA of T7 RNA polymerase is again translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm to produce T7 RNA polymerase, and self-amplification of the T7 RNA polymerase is achieved by repetition of this entire process. Accordingly, the composition of the present invention is characterized in that it can maintain the T7 RNA polymerase self-amplified by the expression loop of T7 RNA polymerase at high concentration in the cytoplasm for a long period of time.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, the cytoplasmic expression of T7 polymerase was examined over time by western blot in B16F10/RFP cells, which were treated with the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposome transporter (auto_shRFP@LS) containing the plasmid DNA (auto_T7pol plasmid). As a result, it was confirmed that the concentration of the T7 polymerase was maintained in the cytoplasm at high concentration for at least 9 days (FIG. 3A).",
                                "The DNA fragment encoding the gene expression inhibitor of the present invention may be comprised of a T7 promoter, DNA encoding a gene expression inhibitor, and a T7 termination sequence, which are operably linked. The gene expression inhibitor may be any one selected from the group consisting of siRNAs, shRNAs, microRNAs, and aptamers, and specifically shRNA, but any one produced via transcription of the DNA fragment by the self-amplified T7 RNA polymerase can be included without limitation for the purpose of the present invention as long as it is used so as to inhibit the expression of a particular gene. In an embodiment of the present invention, siRFP (red fluorescent protein) was used as the gene expression inhibitor, but the gene expression inhibitor is not particularly limited thereto.",
                                "The term \u201csmall interfering RNA (siRNA)\u201d, which is an RNAi-inducing material, refers to a short double-helix RNA strand consisting of about 20 to 30 nucleotides. Once siRNAs are injected into a cell, they target mRNAs with a complementary nucleotide sequence thereto and thereby inhibit the expression of the corresponding genes. The term \u201csmall hairpin RNA (shRNA)\u201d refers to an artificial RNA molecule with a hairpin structure that can be used for inhibiting the expression of a target gene via the phenomenon of RNA interference. Since shRNA has a relatively low decomposition rate and turnover, it can be effectively used for RNAi. The term \u201cmicroRNA\u201d refers to a ribonucleic acid molecule having a length of about 22 nucleotides, and it is found in all eukaryotic cells. The microRNAs can inhibit the expression of a particular gene by binding to a target RNA transcript with a complementary sequence thereto thereby inhibiting translation of the transcript; by histone modification; or by inducing DNA methylation to a promoter of the target gene.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, the long-term shRNA expression in the cytoplasm by the DOPC liposome transporter (auto_shRFP@ LS) and the presence of their conversion to siRNAs were evaluated. As a result, it was confirmed that siRFPs at high concentration were observed in the cells treated with the auto_shRFP@LS for at least 13 days, however, siRFPs at a significantly lower concentration were able to be measured in cells treated with auto(\u2212)_shRFP@LS, which was used as the control, for only 10 days (FIGS. 3B and 3C).",
                                "The composition for sustained inhibition of gene expression of the present invention may be that which enables sustained long-term expression of the gene expression inhibitor by increasing the expression of cytoplasmic T7 RNA polymerase in a nucleus-independent manner Specifically, the sustained expression of the gene expression inhibitor may be sustained long-term production of shRNAs in the cytoplasm from the composition, but the expression is not limited thereto.",
                                "The existing method of shRNA expression in the nucleus using plasmid DNA with a nucleus-dependent promoter relies on cell membrane permeability, which has efficiency as low as 1%, and compared to that by cell membrane permeability, the efficiency of inhibiting gene expression is very low. Additionally, the shRNAs expressed in the nucleus can be converted by a dicer, etc. to mature siRNAs, which can participate in gene silencing, only when they are released into the cytoplasm. However, these exportin-5 transporters involved in the release of shRNAs into the cytoplasm are problematic because they become saturated by highly-concentrated shRNAs, thereby preventing even the release of microRNAs involved in other cellular functions.",

                                "As used herein, the term \u201ctarget tissue\u201d refers to a tissue in which gene expression is inhibited by the composition of the present invention, and specifically a cancer tissue, but the target tissue is not limited thereto.",

Specifically, the transporter may be liposomes, polymer-based nanoparticles, dendrimers, and gold nanoparticles, and more specifically, cationic liposomes which are conventionally used for the delivery of genetic materials. The liposome may be DC-Chol/DOPE liposome, DMRIE/DOPE liposome, EDMPC/Chol liposome, GL-67/DOPE/DMPE/PEG liposome, or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposome, but the liposome is not limited thereto.",

                                "The transporter may be a liposome comprised of DOPC, and it may be prepared by mixing a composition, which comprises an mRNA fragment of T7 RNA polymerase, plasmid DNA for self-amplification of the T7 RNA polymerase, and a DNA fragment encoding gene-expression inhibitor; and DOPC in a weight ratio of 1:5 (w/w) to 1:10 (w/w), but the weight ratio is not limited thereto.",

In particular, both termini include BamHI/XhoI site sequences. The amplified PCR product was treated with BamHI/XhoI restriction enzymes and inserted into the pT7CFE1-NHis plasmid using T4 DNA ligase. In particular, T7 polymerase gene is located downstream of T7 promoter and viral IRES element provided by the pT7CFE1-NHis plasmid, while simultaneously being located upstream of polyA sequence and T7 termination sequence thereof (T7 promoter/viral IRES element/T7 polymerase/polyA tail/T7 termination).

For the synthesis of 5\u2032-capped T7pol mRNA, a dsDNA template having a T7 promoter-T7 polymerase sequence was first synthesized by a chemical synthesis method (outsourced to Bioneer Corporation, Korea). With regard to the T7 promoter-T7 polymerase DNA template, it was possible to synthesize 5\u2032-capped T7pol mRNA in vitro using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB). More specifically, during the in vitro transcription reaction, anti-reverse cap analog (ARCA) (also called 3\u2032-O-Me-7mG(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G cap analog) was added along with four kinds of standard NTPs, in which the molar ratio of ARCA:GTP was 4:1. The dsDNA template was removed by adding DNA nuclease thereto, and the remaining 5 \u2018-capped T7pol mRNA was purified using a LiCl extraction method and an ethanol precipitation method. The 5\u2019-cap-free T7pol mRNA (i.e., the control group) was synthesized based on the same T7 promoter-T7 polymerase DNA template using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The difference in molecular weight between the synthesized 5\u2032-capped T7pol mRNA and 5\u2032-cap-free T7pol mRNA was confirmed by performing agarose gel electrophoresis (FIG. 7).",

Tween 20 was added to the mixture under the condition where Tween 20: oligonucleotides/DOPC is 1:19 (w/w), and the resultant was lyophilized in an acetone/dry ice bath so as to remove the organic solvent. Then, a 0.9% saline solution was added to the lyophilized mixture, and free oligonucleotides which were not loaded in the liposomes were removed using the amino \u03bcLtracentrifuge filter (30K MWCO, Millipore). The amount of free oligonucleotides that passed through a filter was measured using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and the concentration of the oligonucleotides loaded in the liposomes (the oligonucleotide/DOPC liposome complex) was shown to be 150 \u03bcg/mL."

S.; Kim, S. W. J. Control. Rel. 1998, 54, 39 to 48). Specifically, the B16F10/RFP cells in an exponential growth phase were grown in a 96-well plate to a density of 20,000 cells/well. Each well was treated with the auto_shRFP@LS prepared in Example 2 at various concentrations, and the cells were cultured for 24 or 48 hours.

As a result, the auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles did not cause TNF-\u03b1 induction, unlike the lipopolysaccharides which caused TNF-\u03b1 induction. The INF-\u03b1 induction was also examined, and it was found that auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles hardly caused INF-\u03b1 induction, while CpG oligodeoxynucleotides released a large amount of INF-\u03b1. These results demonstrate that the auto_shRFP@ LS nanoparticles do not stimulate innate immunogenicity and thus it is possible to intravenously inject the auto_shRFP@ LS nanoparticles during clinical application."

These samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred into PVDF membranes. To prevent non-specific staining, these membranes were blocked in the presence of 0.2% Tween-20 and 5% dry milk, subjected to primary staining with a T7 polymerase antibody, secondary staining with a secondary antibody to which HRP was bound, and developed using chemiluminescence.",

The 5\u2032-capped T7 polymerase mRNA, which was transfected to cells at the early stage, can express the T7 polymerase by translational machinery containing cytoplasmic ribosomes, and the T7 polymerase binds to the T7 promoter of the auto_T7pol plasmid, thereby repeatedly producing cytoplasmic T7 polymerase transcripts.",

Additionally, when the IRES element was removed from the auto_T7pol plasmid, the amount of cytoplasmic T7 polymerase was observed to be similar to that of auto(\u2212)_shRNA @ LS. These results demonstrate that the modified pT7/T7 polymerase system including the IRES element and the 5\u2032-capped T7 polymerase mRNA can perform long-term (for at least 9 days) sustained expression of T7 polymerase in the cytoplasm."

As the control group, mice intravenously injected with siRFP@LS were prepared.",
                                "As a result, it was confirmed that the RFP fluorescence signal increased in proportion to the growth of cancer in PBS-injected mice with time. However, in the mice intravenously injected auto_shRFP@LS, only cancer tissue grew while the fluorescence intensity in the cancer tissue was inhibited. In the mice intravenously injected with siRFP@LS, it was observed that the fluorescence intensity was decreased for the first three days in the cancer tissue, but the fluorescence intensity on the 6th day was similar to that of PBS buffer-injected mice. Unlike existing siRNA delivery methods where intravenously injections are repeatedly administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days, the auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles of the present invention, even by one intravenous injection, can effectively silence the target gene in the cancer tissue for more than 6 days.",

As a result, strong fluorescence signals were observed in the cancer tissue of the control mouse, but relatively, significantly-reduced fluorescence signals were observed in the mice treated with auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles (FIG. 7C). The removed cancer tissue was subjected to immunohistochemical staining using an anti-RFP antibody. As a result, it was observed that a large amount of RFP protein was stained in the cancer tissue of mice intravenously injected a PBS buffer or siRFP@LS, whereas a relatively lesser amount of RFP protein was stained in the cancer tissue of mice treated with auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles (FIG. 7D). Additionally, the RFP mRNA remaining in the cancer tissue removed from the mice was quantified by qRT-PCR, and as a result, it was observed that a relatively large amount of RFP mRNA was reduced only in the cancer tissue of mice treated with auto_shRFP@LS nanoparticles (FIG. 7E).",
