    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method for predicting a behavior of agents in a dynamic system with a multiplicity of interacting agents depending on the latent state thereof. For a plurality of components and for a plurality of time points up to a prediction time point, a value of a first moment of a first distribution, which models the latent state of the agents, is determined for each component. A value of a second moment of the first distribution is determined. An expected value for a first moment of a second distribution at the prediction time point is determined for each component depending on the value of the first moment of the first distribution at the prediction time point and depending on the value of the second moment of the first distribution at the prediction time point. The second distribution models the behavior of the agents depending on the latent state thereof.",
