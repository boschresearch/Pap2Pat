# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate personality trait recognition
- limitations of bag-of-words approach
- overview of deep learning approaches

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

- outline trait prediction method

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce personality trait prediction system
- define key terms: character, word, text sequence
- describe system architecture: computer-implemented system, memory, processor, I/O devices
- outline software instructions: learning component, text preprocessing, character embedding, modeling, prediction, output
- describe learning component: learning prediction model, accessing training collection
- describe output component: outputting trait prediction, generating information based on prediction

### Sequence Preprocessing (S104, S202)

- preprocess input text sequence: tokenization, normalization

### Character Embedding (S106)

- generate character embedding: one-hot vector representation, transformation to d-dimensional vector

### Sequence Representation and Prediction

- introduce compositional model
- describe character sequence model
- describe word sequence model
- describe sentence representation
- describe prediction model
- describe multitask learning model

### Generating User Scores

- describe generating user scores

### Learning the Prediction Model (S102)

- describe learning the prediction model

### Multitask Learning

- describe multitask learning model

### Examples

- introduce dataset and preprocessing
- describe experiments and evaluation metrics
- present results and comparisons with other models
- discuss multitask learning and feature engineering

### Principal Component Analysis of Features

- visualize learned representations using PCA
