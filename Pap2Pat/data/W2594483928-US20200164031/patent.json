                        "Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality; it is often encountered as the final stage of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis brought about by hemodynamic overload (Zarrinkoub et al., 2013). Some forms of cardiomyopathy\u2014termed inflammatory cardiomyopathies\u2014are caused by autoimmunity or by immune responses to infection, indicating that cardiac dysfunction can also result from disease of the immune system (Bulut et al., 2012). Intriguingly, recent studies have uncovered that HF induced by hemodynamic overload also involves a significant inflammatory component (Shioi et al., 1997) (Oka et al., 2012) (Hofmann and Frantz, 2013). This inflammation is characterized by the presence in the myocardium of cells of the innate immune system (macrophages) and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, which impact negatively on disease outcome (Shioi et al., 1997) (Ancey et al., 2002) (Souders et al., 2012). Even though its congenic absence can be compensated (Lai et al., 2012), IL-6 administration is sufficient to set off the process leading to pathological cardiac hypertrophy (Melendez et al., 2010). It is believed that the innate immune cells and cytokines promote inflammation in the heart, worsening the disease outcome. Although the concept of inflammation as a major component of HF is consolidated (Mann, 2002), clinical trials attempting to combat HF by blocking cytokines have not been successful (Yndestad et al., 2006) (Hofiiiann and Frantz, 2013). The reason for this failure could be the redundant function of individual cytokines (Lai et al., 2012). Therefore, in order to identify more suitable immunotherapy targets for HF, we need to better characterize the involvement and hierarchy of different soluble immune mediators and of the cells of the innate and the adaptive immune system in the disease. The innate immune system acts via the production of cytokines as a non-specific, but effective and rapid, line of defense against pathogens. During long-lasting responses, however, it becomes subject to the control of the adaptive immune system's T lymphocytes (T cells) (Loke et al., 2007), which, along with B cells, mediate antigen-specific immune responses. Therefore, T cells, if involved in HF pathogenesis, could become attractive and more specific immunotargets for therapeutic intervention. This assumption is supported by the implication of T cells in pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis (Yu et al., 2006)."

                        "The inventors identified immune mediators involved in pressure overload-induced HF, finding that T cells infiltrated the pathologically hypertrophic myocardium, in line with their role in long-lasting inflammation. In fact, inflammation is a key factor distinguishing pathological hypertrophy from physiological, \u201cbenign\u201d hypertrophy, which occurs during exercise training. Taking advantage of the presence of T cells, inventors utilized abatacept\u2014an FDA-approved CTLA4-Ig fusion protein (marketed under the trade name ORENCIA\u00ae) that blocks T cell costimulation, selectively inhibiting pro-inflammatory T cell function (Moreland et al., 2006)\u2014to significantly blunt cardiac dysfunction in a mouse HF model. Abatacept systemically inhibited T cell activation and reduced cardiac T cell infiltration, leading to reduced cardiomyocyte death, via a mechanism dependent upon the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleulin-10 (IL-10). Taken together, the findings of the present inventors indicate that T cells are involved in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and that interfering with their activation, using e.g. existing, clinically-validated strategies, has the potential to become a therapeutic option for heart failure."

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), which is also known as CD152, is a protein involved in the regulation of the immune system. Naturally occurring CTLA4 is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,434,131 , 5,844,095, and 5,851,795. Natural CTLA4 proteins are encoded by the CTLA4 gene. CTLA4 is a cell surface protein, having an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain binds to and/or interferes with target antigens, such as CD80 and CD86, serves as nature natural break of T cell stimulation. In some embodiments, the extracellular domain of the CTLA4 molecule begins with methionine at position +1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124; in other embodiments, the extracellular domain begins with alanine at position \u02dc1 and ends at aspartic acid at position +124.",
                        "A CTLA4 molecule is a molecule comprising a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) extracellular domain. In some embodiments, the extracellular domain of CTLA4 comprises a portion of the CTLA4 protein that recognizes and binds to at least one B7 (CD80/86) antigens such as a B7 antigen expressed on B cells and APCs. The extracellular domain may also include fragments or derivatives of CTLA4 that bind a B7 antigen. The CTLA4 extracellular domain can also recognize and bind CD80 (B7-1) and/or CD86 (B7-2). The extracellular domain may also include fragments or derivatives of CTLA4 that bind a binds CD80 and/or CD86. The CTLA4 molecule may be a fusion protein, where a fusion protein is defined as one or more amino acid sequences joined together using methods well known in the art. The joined amino acid sequences thereby form one fusion protein. In some embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule contains at least a portion of an immunoglobulin, such as the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, the CTLA4 molecule is an isolated and purified CTLA4 molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the T-cell costimulation inhibitor comprises the extracellular domain of CTLA4, or a functional fragment or immunologically active variant thereof. The T-cell costimulation inhibitor may bind a B7 antigen expressed on B cells or other antigen presenting cells (APCs). In some embodiments, the B7 antigen is expressed on B cells and on APCs. In some embodiments, the fusion protein is Abatacept. Abatacept is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 linked to the modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 1). Abatacept is produced by recombinant D A technology in a mammalian cell expression system. The apparent molecular weight of abatacept is 92 kilodaltons. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,851,795, 7,455,835, and U.S. Pat. Pub. 2001 1/31 1529. Abatacept selectively binds to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking the interaction with CD28 and interfering with T-cell activation. It inhibits naive T-cell activation, thus having the potential to selectively inhibit T-cell response to specific antigens instead of broad immunosuppression. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an oil-based carrier such as a water-in-oil emulsion (e.g., IFA or Montamide ISA).

All are herein incorporated by reference. An effective amount of CTLA4Ig molecule may be an amount about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg weight of a subject. In another embodiment, the effective amount is an amount about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg weight of a subject. In a specific embodiment, the effective amount of CTLA4Ig is about 2 mg/kg weight of a subject. In another specific embodiment, the effective amount of CTLA4Ig is about 10 mg/kg weight of a subject. In another specific embodiment, an effective amount of CTLA4Ig is 500 mg for a subject weighing less than 60 kg, 750 mg for a subject weighing between 60-100 kg and 1000 mg for a subject weighing more than 100 kg. An effective amount of CTLA4Ig molecule may be administered to a subject daily, weekly, monthly and/or yearly, in single or multiple times per hour/day/week/month/year, depending on need. For example, in one embodiment, an effective amount of the CTLA4Ig molecule may initially be administered once every two weeks for a month, and then once every month thereafter. The administration of the CTLA4Ig molecules of the invention can be via a 30 minute to one or more hour intravenous infusion. Alternatively, single to multiple subcutaneous injections can deliver the required dosage. Typically, a 30 minute intravenous infusion is the administration route utilized during the early phase of treatment. The dose may be repeated 2 and 4 weeks after the initial dose, then every 4 weeks thereafter. It may be administered alone or with disease-modifying drugs other than TNF antagonists. The subcutaneous injection is the typical administration mode utilized during the maintenance phase. For example after a single intravenous infusion as a loading dose (as per body weight categories above), 125 mg administered by subcutaneous injection may be given within a day, followed by 125 mg subcutaneously once a week. Patients who are unable to receive an infusion may initiate weekly injections subcutaneously without an Intravenous loading dose. Patients transitioning from intravenous therapy to subcutaneous administration may administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose.

When the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to the rest of the body at normal filling left ventricular pressures, blood can back up into the lungs, causing the lungs to become congested with fluid. Typical symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath (dyspnea), fatigue, weakness, difficulty breathing when lying flat, and swelling of the legs, ankles or abdomen (edema). Causes of heart failure are related to various disorders including coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, congenital heart disease, abnormal heart valves or valvular heart disease, severe lung disease, diabetes, severe anemia hyperthyroidism, arrhythmia or dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction. Heart failure can occur in the presence of a normal (>50%) or a reduced (<50%) left ventricular ejection fraction. There is increased recognition that these two conditions represent two different disease states, rather than a continuum (Borlaug B A, Redfield M M. Circulation. 2011 May 10; 123(18):2006-13). Heart failure according to the present invention includes overt and/or advanced heart failure. In overt heart failure, the subject shows symptoms of heart failure as known to the person skilled in the art. HF can be classified into various degrees of severity. According to the NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification, heart failure patients are classified as belonging to NYHA classes I, II, III and IV. A patient having heart failure has already experienced structural and functional changes to his pericardium, myocardium, coronary circulation or cardiac valves. He will not be able to fully restore his health, and is in need of a therapeutical treatment. Patients of NYHA Class I have no obvious symptoms of cardiovascular disease but already have objective evidence of functional impairment. Patients of NYHA class II have slight limitation of physical activity. Patients of NYHA class III show a marked limitation of physical activity. Patients of NYHA class IV are unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. They show symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest. This functional classification is supplemented by the more recent classification by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (see J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 38; 2101-2113, updated in 2005, see J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2005; 46; e1-e82). 4 stages A, B, C and D are defined. Stages A and B are not HF but are considered to help identify patients early before developing \u201ctruly\u201d HF. Stages A and B patients are best defined as those with risk factors for the development of HF. For example, patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus who do not yet demonstrate impaired left ventricular (LV) function, hypertrophy, or geometric chamber distortion would be considered stage A, whereas patients who are asymptomatic but demonstrate LV hypertrophy and/or impaired LV function would be designated as stage B. Stage C then denotes patients with current or past symptoms of HF associated with underlying structural heart disease (the bulk of patients with HF), and stage D designates patients with truly refractory HF.

Cardiac functionality was monitored via regular transthoracic echocardiography (Table 1). At 1 week post-TAC, we found a significant upregulation of Tnfa and Il6, as previously described (Souders et al., 2012) (Kuang et al., 2013). Cells of the immune system are recruited to and/or retained at their sites of action via chemokines. We found a significant early expression of Ccl2 and Cxcl11 (Xia et al., 2009) as well as Ccl4, Ccl5 and Cxcl10 (FIG. 1), the majority of which are markers of a type 1 (M1/Th1)-polarized inflammatory response (Mantovani et al., 2004). Itgam (CD11b), a hallmark of the presence of innate immune cells, such as macrophages or monocytes, was also upregulated 1 week post-TAC, suggesting that type 1-polarized innate immune cells are recruited to the stressed myocardium early on.",

Concurrent upregulation of Il4, a hallmark of type 2 (M2/Th2)-polarized responses, suggests a gradual shift from an M1 to an M2/Th2 response as the myocardium progresses toward HF. Indeed, Th2-polarized T cells have been reported to promote fibrosis in other pathological conditions (Wynn, 2004). Transcripts of cytokines that characterize Th1 and Th17 responses, such as Ifng and Il17, or of the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il10 were not significantly altered at any time point.",

                                "As we had generated data on Cd3e expression (indicative of T cell presence) and il6 expression (indicative of inflammation), we asked whether the onset of inflammation correlated with T cell infiltration and/or proliferation. Assuming a linear regression model, we first examined the correlation between Cd3e and il6 in samples derived from TAC-operated mice, 4 weeks post-operation. The results (FIG. 13, circles and corresponding regression line) show a significant positive slope, suggesting that such a correlation exists. A likely interpretation would be that inflammation drives the infiltration and/or proliferation of T cells into the myocardium. Repeating the analysis for sham-operated animals (FIG. 13, squares and corresponding regression line) also yielded a significant positive slope, however with lower mean il6 and cd3e values. This suggests that, even in the absence of the aortic constriction, the limited (but nonetheless present) inflammation generated by the sham operation (which does involve surgery, albeit without permanent constriction) may be leading to a limited infiltration/proliferation of T cells, even if this is significantly lower than in TAC (as shown in FIG. 1).",

Yet non-pathological forms of cardiac hypertrophy also exist, which do not lead to fibrosis or cardiac dysfunction. The most physiologically relevant model for these is exercise training. Mice subjected to a running program show \u201cphysiological\u201d hypertrophy in which the increase in cardiomyocyte size is accompanied by an increased functionality of the cells and absence of fibrosis (Perrino et al., 2006) (Kemi et al., 2008). We thus asked whether the immune mediators that we identified in the TAC model of HF were also present in exercise-trained mice. We found no significant upregulation of immune response mediator transcripts in these mice (FIG. 8A). This finding strongly suggests that, unlike pathological hypertrophy, physiological hypertrophy features a complete absence not only of fibrosis, but also of an innate and adaptive immune response.",
                                "To better visualize these differences, we plotted an index of heart dysfunction (loss in percent fractional shortening, i.e., the decrease in pumping volume of the ventricle) against an index of inflammation (i.e., the ratio of transcript expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10) (FIG. 2). The resulting dot plot, where each dot represents one animal and the ellipses represent one standard deviation for both variables, illustrates clearly the link between inflammation and impaired heart function. Whilst both exercise-trained mice (FIG. 2: Exercised (running) mice) and TAC-operated mice (FIG. 2: TAC model of HF) are characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, the pathologically-hypertrophic TAC-operated mice had increased indices of inflammation (values shifted towards the right compared to healthy controls) and increased heart dysfunction (values shifted towards the top compared to healthy controls). On the other hand, exercised mice had an inflammation index similar to that of healthy controls but an improved heart function (downward shift on the y axis). A more \u201cartificial\u201d, non-pathological hypertrophy model, induced by cardiac-specific overexpression of the constitutively active E40K mutant of the serine-threonine kinase Akt in the heart (Condorelli et al., 2002), displayed an incomplete array of pro-inflammatory mediators present in the left ventricle of 8-week old Akt transgenic mice (FIG. 8B). Hence these mice occupied an intermediate state in the heart dysfunction versus inflammation dot plot, i.e., one in-between the two extremes of TAC- and running-induced hypertrophies. Thus, our results support a positive association between inflammation and the pathological nature of cardiac hypertrophy.",

                                "The above findings encourage the notion that inhibition of inflammation could be a promising strategy against HF. This approach has been attempted before, but the targets identified resulted to be inadequate for this end (Yndestad et al., 2006) (Hofmann and Frantz, 2013). T cells are required for the maintenance of long-term immune responses (Loke et al., 2007) and thus could represent a better therapeutic target. Driven by the finding of T cell-specific Cd3e mRNA upregulation in TAC mice at 4 weeks post-TAC, we further investigated the presence of T cells in pathological hypertrophy. By examining the left ventricles of mice by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-CD3e (FIG. 3A), we found that T cells were visibly and significantly more abundant in TAC versus sham mice at 4 weeks (FIG. 3B), confirming the mRNA data. During the time course of the pathology, T cells presumably react in an antigen-specific manner, involving few specific clones that subsequently expand in number. Thus we hypothesized that T cells should also be detectable at an early stage of disease development. We performed the IHC analysis on mice at 1 week post-TAC, and indeed we were able to detect T cells (FIG. 3C). We also performed lymphocyte-enriching gradient purification on cardiac suspensions derived from hearts of mice at 1 week post-TAC, and observed that the resultant cell populations did include CD3e-expressing cells when examined by flow cytometry (FIG. 3D). Therefore, T cells were present in the hypertrophic myocardium even at an early stage of the pathology. Previous studies in the TAC model have identified that cardiac dysfunction can be detected as early as 2 days post-TAC. T cell activation is often initiated at the lymph nodes that drain the site of inflammation. We thus examined via flow cytometry whether, at 2 days post-TAC, T cells were activated in the heart-draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes. We also examined non-draining (inguinal) lymph nodes as well as spleens of the same animals. We found that, at day 2, a significant upregulation of the activation marker CD25 could be seen among CD3+ T cells in the heart-draining lymph nodes, though not in the more distal, non-draining lymphoid compartments (FIG. 3e). The early presence of T cells, and identification of T cell presence in the ailing myocardium, thus creates an opportunity for attempting a manipulation of their function for therapeutic purposes.",
                                "In order to confirm the clinical relevance of our findings in the human setting, we examined T cell abundance in cardiac tissue derived from heart failure patients suffering from primary cardiomyopathy, which shares pathological traits with our experimental mouse model. We examined tissue from patients carrying lamin A/C mutations, which lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. A subset of these carried a second mutation in titin, leading to a more severe dilated cardiomyopathy. We chose these patients as their cardiomyopathy is caused by a non-immunological cause, unlike inflammatory, autoimmune or viral cardiomyopathies. Thus detection of T cells in the left ventricle of these patients would suggest that presence of T cells is correlated not only with cardiomyopathies initiated by excessive immune responses, but also with cardiomyopathies triggered by non-immune causes. The cardiac samples were obtained during surgery for the placement of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD), attesting to the advanced stage of their cardiac dysfunction. Azan's trichrome analysis for collagen (FIG. 3G) confirmed presence of fibrosis in these specimens (FIG. 3F). Analysis of T cell abundance via CD3e IHC (FIG. 31) in the same samples revealed the presence of infiltrating T cells, like in the hearts of mice at 4 weeks post-TAC, (FIG. 3B). In addition to the above LVAD HF patient samples, we also examined samples from patients suffering from aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis leads to heart failure 24 and represents the clinical condition that is mechanistically the closest the TAC mouse model. We found that left ventricles from patients with this form of cardiomyopathy also demonstrated a similarly increased fibrosis (FIG. 3j) and T cell presence (FIG. 3k). Taken together, these results lend further support to a link between T cell presence, cardiac fibrosis and pathological hypertrophy.",

                                "We hypothesized that specific inhibition of T cell function would have a beneficial effect on HF development. CTLA4 is one of the inhibitory molecules through which naturally occurring regulatory T cells suppress T cell activation under physiological conditions (Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). It blocks the CD80/CD86 costimulation signals that T cells must receive from antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, B cells or macrophages) in order to become fully activated (Moreland et al., 2006). CTLA4-Ig fusion protein (abatacept, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease) is a stable, soluble form of CTLA4. We therefore tested whether the administration of abatacept produced a beneficial effect in the TAC model of HF. We treated mice that had been TAC- or sham-operated with three intraperitoneal injections per week of 200 micrograms of abatacept, for 4 weeks, starting 2 days after the operation. As controls, TAC- and sham-operated mice received PBS, at the same timepoints. Cardiac function was monitored by transthoracic echocardiography (see Table 2). Day 2 post-operation was chosen as the first time-point of treatment as significant cardiac dysfunction (increase in left ventricle thickness) can already be detected at 2 days post-TAC via clinically-relevant diagnostic techniques (echocardiography).",
                                "PBS-treated TAC-operated mice at 1 and 4 weeks post-operation displayed a significant reduction in cardiac function, expressed as percent fractional shortening (FS) or ejection fraction (EF) compared to sham controls, whilst abatacept-treated mice had no significant difference in FS or EF from sham controls (FIG. 4A-B). Difference in FS was evident from the first week post-TAC operation, up to the end of the experiment (FIG. 4A); also difference in EF increased in significance with time between the PBS- and abatacept-treated groups (FIG. 4B). Hence by administering abatacept starting from 2 days after TAC surgery, we were able to significantly reduce the extent and delay the progression of degradation of cardiac function. The beneficial effect of abatacept was also evident by analyzing other hemodynamic parameters, including the end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDd) (FIG. 4C), and the end systolic one (LVIDs) (FIG. 4D). Other measured parameters are reported in (Table 2). At 3 weeks post-operation, a transient yet significant difference between abatacept-treated and sham control animals could be seen. At the end of the fourth week, we assessed the morphometric indicators of cardiac hypertrophy: heart weight to body weight ratio (FIG. 9A), left ventricle to body weight ratio (FIG. 9B), heart weight to tibia length ratio (FIG. 9C). TAC-operated mice treated with abatacept displayed significantly lower hypertrophy than PBS-treated controls, according to most of these parameters. Analysis of myocardial \u201cstress genes\u201d, a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, in the left ventricles by qPCR also showed a significant up-regulation of \u03b2-Myosin heavy chain (Mhy7) (FIG. 9D), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (Nppb) (FIG. 9E) and Atrial Natriuretic Factor (Nppa) (FIG. 9F) mRNAs for the PBS- but not for the abatacept-treated groups. Thus, abatacept treatment significantly reduces the severity and delays the progression of the cardiac dysfunction caused by the ventricular pressure overload.",
                                "We also examined sections with Azan's trichrome staining in order to assess the levels of fibrosis (Condorelli et al., 1999). A comparison of collagen intensity in identical regions sampled for all treatment groups identified significant increases in fibrosis levels for all TAC-operated groups except for the mice treated with abatacept (FIG. 4F). These results suggest that the beneficial effect of abatacept is also reflected in protection from cardiac fibrosis, a biological response invariably linked to heart failure (Kong et al., 2014). Importantly, abatacept is based on human CTLA-4 fused with human immunoglobulin and thus suitable for human use, but it has been extensively shown to function in mice, due to the high similarity of human and mouse CTLA-4(Dhirapong et al., 2013). As human Ig administration could be immunogenic in mice( ), we included a further set of non-operated mice that received abatacept or an isotype control immunoglobulin (Ig), to assess any reactivity of the recipients to the human Ig used in the fusion protein. Neither abatacept alone nor human IgG control injections led to any significant change in heart function (FIG. 10), signifying that any alloreactivity to the immunoglobulin had limited effects.",
                                "Nonetheless, the potential for alloreactivity of the IgG control, in the absence of the immunosuppressive CTLA-4 domain, could possibly worsen the TAC-induced inflammation. For this reason, we chose to use PBS administration rather than IgG administration as a control for our experiments, so as to avoid any deleterious effect on the controls creating the appearance of a stronger therapeutic effect in the abatacept-treated group. Indeed, when we assessed the in vivo effect of abatacept in TAC-operated mice, we found that its protective effect appeared to be even more significant when compared to isotype control-treated rather than PBS-treated TAC-operated mice (FIG. 10c,d,e,f). This confirmed the validity of our choice of controls.",

For this reason, we repeated the in vivo treatment with abatacept, albeit commencing the first treatment at 2 weeks post-TAC, instead of 2 days post-TAC. As can be seen (FIG. 4g, h) treatment at a late timepoint nonetheless was able to significantly block the further reduction of FS and EF in treated animals. A significant protective effect was also observed in LVIDs (FIG. 10g). These results demonstrate that even late treatment with the drug may have substantial beneficial effects in limiting the progression of HF.",

                                "Extensive studies have shown that CTLA4-Ig inhibits T cell function, by blocking the costimulatory receptors on antigen presenting cells, which are required for the full activation of pro-inflammatory T cells (Linsley et al., 1991) (Moreland et al., 2006).",
                                "Indeed, the CTLA-4 molecule represents one of the main available mechanisms through which already initiated T cell responses can be physiologically downregulated (Bluestone, 1997) (Krummey and Ford, 2014). We therefore sought to dissect how abatacept was affecting T cell activation in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. For this, we examined via flow cytometry the expression of activation marker CD25 in T cells at an early timepoint (1 week post-TAC), which is likely to be the relevant time window for activation events. Abatacept significantly reduced the percentage of CD25+cells among T cells, not only in the heart-draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes, but also in inguinal lymph nodes and spleen (FIG. 5A). This suggests that abatacept exerted a systemic dampening of T cell activation. CD25 expression on the T cells infiltrating the heart could not be reliably assessed due to the low number of T cells found in the heart at 1 week post-TAC, which renders flow cytometric analysis of subpopulations technically challenging.",
                                "Reduced T cell activation is likely to lead to reduced proliferation and lower T cell numbers at later timepoints. Indeed, at 4 weeks after surgery, the myocardium of abatacept-treated mice displayed significantly fewer infiltrating T cells than PBS-treated mice (FIG. 5B). Of note, the IgG isotype control for abatacept had no effect on in vitro T cell responses, unlike abatacept itself (FIG. 11A). We also wondered whether the abatacept-mediated suppression of T cells led to a downstream inhibitory effect on macrophage activation, which has recently been shown to contribute to cardiac pathology (Epelman et al., 2014). We assessed via immunohistochemistry the expression of AIF-1 (Iba-1), a marker of T cell-derived macrophage activation (Utans et al., 1995) (Tian et al., 2006), in the hearts of operated mice. In TAC-operated mice, Abatacept treatment led to a significant reduction in AIF-1 signal compared to PBS-treated controls (FIG. 5C). Sham-operated mice had negligible signals of AIF-1+ cells. At 4 weeks post-surgery, the difference in AIF-1+ macrophages between the two groups was minimal (FIG. 14), most likely as the overall levels of AIF-1+ macrophages, or indeed total CD11+ innate immune cells (FIG. 1) in TAC-operated mice is reduced at this late stage of the pathology.",

We considered the percentage of Ly6C+F4-80+ (immature macrophages) or Ly6C\u2212F4-80+ (mature macrophages) out of CD11b+CD45+ live single cells (gating strategy shown in FIG. 15). We found that hearts of abatacept-treated animals had significantly higher percentage of immature macrophages (FIG. 5e) and significantly lower percentage of mature macrophages (FIG. 5f), compared to controls.",
                                "This finding suggests that the inhibition of T cells according to the invention may also have downstream effects on pathogenic macrophages in the myocardium, including, e.g., on the activation and maturation state of macrophages in the myocardium.",
                                "**The Protective Effect of Abatacept is Dependent on IL-10**",
                                "The effect of abatacept on T cell activation occurs via the removal of pro-inflammatory, costimulatory signals (Krummey and Ford, 2014) on antigen presenting cells, but could additionally be dependent on the production of anti-inflammatory signals, actively inhibiting the pathogenic response (Linsley et al., 1991) (Sage et al., 2014). To further investigate this, we examined the presence of immune mediators via real-time qPCR in the treated TAC-operated animals. At 1 week post-operation, a timepoint when abatacept already leads to cardioprotective effects, mRNA expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly upregulated in both abatacept- and PBS-treated TAC-operated mice (FIG. 5d: il6). This is not surprising as both groups of animals underwent the same TAC treatment, where IL-6 has a central involvement in the stressed myocardium response (Melendez et al., 2010). However, only in the abatacept-treated group could we observe a significant upregulation of mRNA for the cytokine IL-10 (FIG. 5d: il10). Thus, abatacept did produce a significant upregulation of Il10 in TAC-operated mice (FIG. 5D; il10). IL-10 is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokines utilized by the immune system to shut down unwanted or no-longer-needed responses and it has been shown to mediate cardio-protective effects in HF (Verma et al., 2012), its effect on cardiomyocyte function being opposite to that of IL-6 (Melendez et al., 2010). Administration of abatacept itself did not have any direct effects on neonatal cardiomyocytes since in vitro it did not affect their hypertrophic state. These findings, taken together, suggested that abatacept could be mediating anti-inflammatory and subsequent anti-hypertrophic effects via IL-10. As Il10 was upregulated in abatacept-treated TAC mice, we assessed which subset of immune cells could function as sources of IL-10. We examined the expression of intracellular IL-10 by flow cytometry in splenocytes exposed in vitro to abatacept. We found that abatacept induced IL-10 mostly on antigen-presenting cells, the vast majority of which were B cells, whilst a few IL-10 producing T cells could also be identified (FIG. 11B).",
                                "We thus examined whether IL-10 was necessary for the protective effects of abatacept. To address this, we analyzed the effect of abatacept on mice deficient for IL-10 (IL-10KO) subjected to TAC. As outlined above, the hallmark of abatacept function is the suppression of T cell responses. Interestingly, in IL-10KO mice abatacept could no longer inhibit T cell presence in the heart of TAC-operated mice (FIG. 6A), demonstrating that IL-10 is required for the T cell-attenuating, anti-inflammatory effect of the drug.",
                                "Subsequently, we asked whether IL-10 was necessary for the abatacept-mediated effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Echocardiographic analysis of TAC-operated, IL-10KO mice confirmed that IL-10 was required for the beneficial effect of abatacept on the heart (FIG. 6B-E). Finally, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is a hallmark of pathological hypertrophy (Condorelli et al., 1999). Whilst abatacept significantly reduced the extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in wild-type TAC-operated mice, this did not occur in IL-10KO mice, which were refractive to treatment (FIG. 6F).",
                                "Our results, taken together, suggest that abatacept may protect against the progression of HF by removing and actively reversing the pathogenic immune response, consequently affecting cardiac hypertrophy, in a manner dependent on the cytokine IL-10. Calculating and plotting the heart dysfunction and inflammation indices (FIG. 7A,B) shows that abatacept leads to a reduction in inflammation (left-ward shift compared to PBS-treated mice), and consequently to an improvement of cardiac function, evaluated as a reduction in heart dysfunction (shift to lower values on the y axis). Cardiac function was improved also at 4 weeks post-TAC, indicating a delay in the progression of the syndrome (FIG. 7B).",

                                "We then sought to confirm whether the IL-10 producing cells identified above (i.e. mostly B cells, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014T cells) could be sufficient to rescue the loss of the protective effect in IL-10KO animals. To achieve this, we first transferred 2\u00b7106 wild-type (IL-10-sufficient) B cells or 2\u00b7106 wild-type (IL-10 sufficient) T cells into IL-10KO recipients. We then proceeded to perform TAC surgery followed by abatacept or control treatment, starting from day 2 post-operation. Transfer of IL-10 wild-type B cells was sufficient to rescue the loss of the abatacept-mediated protective effect in IL-10KO TAC-operated mice (FIG. 6g,h: closed squares). On the other hand, transfer of IL10 wild-type T cells could not rescue the protective effect (FIG. 6g,h: open squares). From this we conclude that IL-10 produced by B cells in response to abatacept must be involved in the mechanism of the abatacept-mediated cardioprotective effect. To assess whether this B cell-mediated effect was dependent on the drug's effect on T cells or whether it could be a direct effect on B cells, we assessed the capacity of splenocytes to produce IL-10 after abatacept administration in vitro, in the presence or absence of T cells. We found that the production of IL-10 was unaffacted by the absence of T cells (FIG. 16), suggesting that the B cell-mediated effect may be direct.",

                        "Inventors herein demonstrate how abatacept, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits T cell costimulation, reduces the severity and delays the progression of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. This outcome was possible because inventors herein found out that HF pathogenesis is associated with an innate and adaptive immune response. Abatacept blunts this response, and hence inhibits the progression of cardiac pathology, via a mechanism dependent on the action of IL-10.",
                        "The cardiac inflammation associated with HF is believed to be triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by stressed cardiomyocytes (Shioi et al., 1997,) (Ancey et al., 2002) (Souders et al., 2012). The presence of such cytokines has been used to distinguish between physiological and pathological hypertrophy (Serra et al., 2010). While confirming and extending knowledge of the association between inflammation and cardiac pathology, importantly, we show here that by targeting the cells of the adaptive immune system, it is possible to interfere with cardiac remodeling by blunting the inflammatory response. This is in contrast to unsuccessful attempts to limit pathology by targeting the cytokines, which have proven to be more elusive targets (Yndestad et al., 2006) (Hofmann and Frantz, 2013).",
                        "A main clinical feature of pathological cardiac hypertrophy is fibrosis. Fibrosis formation in other contexts appears to require the combined action of Th2-polarized T cells and innate immune cells (Wynn, 2004) (Niedermeier et al., 2009). We delineated how cardiac inflammation is initially mediated by M1-polarized innate immune cells and may subsequently switch to an M2/Th2 polarization as time progresses. This is in agreement with two previous studies reporting worse HF in BALB/c compared to C57BL/6 mice, attributable to a greater Th2-bias in the former strain (Yu et al., 2006) (Peng et al., 2011). We also demonstrated the presence of T cells in biopsies from human HF patients, from both patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy derived from non-immunological causes, as well as from patients suffering from aortic stenosis.",
                        "One of the immune system's main means of regulating the action of T cells is via immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg), which suppress deleterious or unwanted responses (Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). Intriguingly, evidence has linked Treg deficiency with chronic HF (Tang et al., 2010). We detected the presence of Tregs, via the expression of their genetic marker Foxp3, in TAC mice, but only at 8 weeks post-surgery (FIG. 12). This may be an indication of a natural immunosuppressive attempt that occurs too late to block the pathogenic immune response (Garetto et al., 2015). There have been two successful experimental attempts to utilize syngenic Treg administration (Treg adoptive cell therapy) in models of HF (Kvakan et al., 2009) (Kanellakis et al., 2011). However, adoptive cell therapy, whilst very promising, is a complex and costly procedure that still needs refinement before it can move to clinical use. An alternative means of taking advantage of the suppressive function of Treg is to selectively activate them via super-activating anti-CD28 antibodies. This has been utilized twice in models of cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI) (Tang et al., 2012) (Weirather et al., 2014). Whilst MI-induced cardiac stress and its associated immune response have several key differences compared to pressure overload-induced HF, the success of these studies represents nonetheless an encouraging milestone. An important caveat of this approach, however, lies in the fact that human patients have far higher numbers of pro-inflammatory memory T cells, which in past clinical trials have been activated by super-activating anti-CD28 clones, with near-lethal consequences for the patients (Suntharalingam et al., 2006). Whilst this issue is being currently addressed with the use of more precise reagents (Weirather et al., 2014), this solution is not yet fully applicable in the clinic. Hence, searching for a more readily translatable solution, we chose to utilize a fusion protein based on CTLA-4, one of the effector molecules of Treg cells. Treg suppress via surface-bound CTLA-4 as well as soluble IL-10 or TGF\u03b2, inhibiting the function of both innate and adaptive immune cells(Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). CTLA-4 specifically inhibits T cell function by blocking the ability of T cells to become costimulated. The CTLA4-Ig fusion protein abatacept is easily administered and already in clinical use to suppress autoimmune responses (Moreland et al., 2006). As the drug is functional in mice, for our attempted therapy we chose to utilize the TAC mouse model of HF. The TAC model is considered the gold standard model of overload-induced HF and indeed it has been used in a very large number of studies on a wide range of conditions associated with HF.",
                        "Even though we did observe a systemic suppression of T cells evident even in non-draining lymphoid organs of abatacept-treated TAC-operated mice, the established clinical safety record of abatacept reduces the risk that this immunosuppressive treatment could expose the body to opportunistic infections.",
                        "We demonstrated that abatacept reduced the severity of cardiac pathology and delayed the development of symptoms of overload-derived cardiac pathology. Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the drug could significantly limit the progression of pathology even when administration commenced at a late stage of disease.",
                        "The drug is known to inhibit T cell function by blocking costimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells (Moreland et al., 2006). Accordingly, we found that abatacept inhibited T cell responses in vivo (FIG. 5), including in heart-draining lymph nodes, where T cell activation appears to be initiated (FIG. 3e). We also observed an inhibition of cardiac macrophage activation and maturation (FIG. 5c,e,f). Inflammation in abatacept-treated mice was attenuated, affecting cardiac macrophage activation (FIG. 5C) as well as the balance of pro- versus anti- cytokine levels, as it can be readily visualized in the heart dysfunction versus inflammation plots (FIG. 7A,B). Abatacept also induced active anti-inflammatory signals, such as the cytokine IL-10, which we detected in vivo (FIG. 5D) and which could be produced by both T cells and antigen presenting cells (FIG. 11B). IL-10 (FIG. 6b-d) was necessary for the protective effects to occur and IL-10 could be produced by B cells after in vitro treatment with the drug (FIG. 11b). IL-10-sufficient B cells appeared to be sufficient to rescue the loss of cardioprotective effects in IL-10KO TAC-operated animals treated with abatacept (FIG. 6a-h). As T cells and antigen presenting cells co-operate for their mutual full activation (Linsley et al., 1991), it is not surprising that both populations may be involved in the induction of anti-inflammatory signals. The schematic outline of this combined removal of pro-inflammatory T cell activation and induction of anti-inflammatory signals (in B cells) is given in (FIG. 7C). As IL-10 has been shown to be directly cardioprotective and antifibrotic (Verma et al., 2012) (Wynn, 2004), the benefit conferred by abatacept treatment could be due to a combined effect of the removal of the pro-inflammatory signals, as well as direct protective effects of IL-10. Both these effects were dependent upon IL-10 because in mice deficient for the cytokine, abatacept treatment no longer suppressed T cell expansion nor protected from loss of cardiac functionality or cardiomyocyte apoptosis.",
                        "Although abatacept has been shown to induce regulatory T cells (Ko et al., 2010), we did not observe any significant induction of Foxp3 mRNA expression in our system. However, we did observe IL-10 production from Foxp3+ Treg cells in vitro following abatacept administration, so this parallel mechanism cannot be formally excluded. As cardiac macrophages, which we found to be suppressed by abatacept, can act as CD80/CD86-expressing antigen presenting cells, we also cannot exclude that the drug suppresses macrophages both via its effect on T cells, and also by acting directly on the macrophages themselves.",
                        "The treatment according to the invention targets the costimulation of T cells and thus their optimal activation. T cell activation may also be relevant for the chronicity of the underlying cardiac disease, and the continuous presence of cognate antigens recognized by T cells may stand in the way of resolution. As an example of an inhibitor of T cell costimulation and/or activation and/or function that is already in clinical use, CLTA4-derived molecules such as a CTLA4-Ig, e.g., Abatacept, may be more translationally relevant than other means of targeting T cells currently being explored for the treatment of pressure overload-induced HF. Further, costimulation requires interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells. Therefore targeting costimulation requires the targeting of CD80/CD86-bearing macrophages and B cells, which contributes to the therapeutic effect, as it affects T cell-associated B cell and macrophage responses.",
                        "IL-10 is directly cardioprotective and antifibrotic. Our results showed that the presence of IL-10 was necessary for the cardioprotective effects of abatacept, and also for the suppression of T cell expansion (FIG. 6a). Yet IL-10 acts downstream of the administration of the drug. Thus the regulation of IL-10 induction will be dependent on localization and abundance of the targets of the drug. A T-cell costimulation inhibitor such as the CTLA4-Ig-type T cell inhibitor Abatacept, even when B cells and macrophages are its direct targets, affects only T cell-associated responses. Abatacept did affect T cell activation systemically (as shown in FIG. 5a) but, extrapolating from the data in autoimmune pathologies cited above, is predicted not to affect T cell-independent innate immune responses, even if its action is dependent on IL-10. The proven safety profile of Abatacept in the clinic offers substantial support to the interpretation that the balance of useful immunosuppression versus induction of functional immunodeficiency may be satisfactory in a CTLA4-based T cell inhibitory molecule such as a CTLA4-Ig, e.g., Abatacept.",
                        "Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate how an FDA-approved drug that inhibits pro-inflammatory T cell function can yield significant therapeutic benefits in a model of HF. The underlying reason for this is that an adaptive immune response is causatively linked to the pathogenesis of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. As T cells contribute greatly to the chronicity of the immune response, their targeting seems to be efficacious in controlling the progression of the pathology.",
                        "The induction of an immune response as a reaction to cardiac pressure overload could be an unwanted consequence of a response originally evolved to deal with pathogen infections. It may be that the body is unable to distinguish between infection- and pressure overload-induced stress signals. Yet, fortuitously, this link between immunity and pathological cardiac hypertrophy also creates an opportunity: functional and validated therapies\u2014currently in clinical use for treating immune-mediated ailments\u2014could become an important tool in the fight against heart failure.",
                        "Thus, in summary, the inventors describe herein that an inhibitor of T cell costimulation and/or activation and/or function is effective in treating or preventing heart failure pathologies that are not induced by inflammatory cardiomyopathies caused by autoimmunity or by immune responses to infection (e.g.: not by viral infection). Pressure-overload induced heart failure is a representative example of the heart failure pathologies thus treated or prevented.",
