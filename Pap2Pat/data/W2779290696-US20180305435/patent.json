    "abstract": "The HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is a critical component in controlling HIV replication and is an important part of the ultimate failure to eradicate the virus. Disclosed herein are methods for genetically enhancing the HIV-specific CTL response to allow long-term viral suppression or viral clearance. Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were genetically modified such that they differentiate into mature CTLs that will kill HIV infected cells. As disclosed herein, the functional effector cells are not human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted. As disclosed herein, stem cells are transduced with non-HLA restricted chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that allow the recognition of HIV or HIV-infected cells when expressed by a CTL. These CARs are hybrid molecules that contain an extracellular HIV recognition domain and an intracellular TCR-zeta signaling domain. The CTL response may be enhanced through the targeting of T cell inhibitory receptors. The methods and compositions disclosed herein may be used to engineer antiviral immunity and HIV-specific CTL responses in vivo. Also disclosed herein are methods and compositions for the treatment of chronic viral infections such as HIV.",

While HIV infections can be controlled in many individuals with antiretroviral drugs, these are expensive and associated with significant toxicities. Due to viral reservoirs, if therapy is terminated, virus replication and disease progression resume, requiring patients to remain on these medications permanently. To date there has only been a single reported case of cured chronic HIV infection in an adult, via bone marrow transplant from a donor lacking the normal gene for C\u2014C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which is a cell receptor required for most strains of HIV to infect cells. However, the mortality rate of this procedure is about 40%, and matched bone marrow with this genetic profile is almost nonexistent for most ethnic groups, rendering this approach impractical for broader clinical applicability. Several recent studies have attempted to remove CCR5 from hematopoietic stem cells and/or deliver anti-HIV genes to protect cells from HIV infection in humans, but these studies face limitations due to unknowns regarding levels of transduced cell engraftment required to generate an HIV-resistant immune system."

                        "The present invention provides a method for programming stem cells to provide a self-renewing population of both CD8+ and CD4+ HIV-targeted T-cells that are resistant to direct HIV infection, and which bypass the mechanisms by which HIV usually evades the immune response. The present invention involves the genetic modification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to form antigen-specific T cells against HIV.",
                        "Modification of human HSCs with a T-cell receptor (TCR) comprising an alpha and beta chain (which bind HIV peptide in the context of an HLA molecule) allows the differentiation of HIV-specific T cells in vivo in humanized mice. See Kitchen et al. (2012) PLoS Pathog. 8(4): e1002649; see also U.S. application Ser. No. 13/045,073, filed 10 Mar. 2011, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The engineered T cells, however, are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restricted.",
                        "The present invention utilizes CARs specific for HIV in place of T cell receptors (TCRs). CARs have an antigen binding domain specific for HIV and an internal TCR signaling domain. When they bind the target antigen, which occurs directly without HLA, they trigger the cell like a TCR. Unlike natural T cell receptors, CARs do not need to recognize HLA molecules to detect antigen. Thus, the engineered T cells according to the present invention are not HLA restricted. Consequently, the CAR constructs and engineered cells according to the present invention need not be matched to a subject's genetic HLA profile for effectively treating the subject. Thus, treatments according to the present invention may be used in HIV infected persons of any HLA types.",
                        "The CAR used as an example herein comprises human CD4 external domain fused to the CD3-zeta signaling region on the T-cell receptor (which mediates T cell activation). Prior to the present invention, it was thought that artificially having the CD4-zeta expressed on the surface of a developing T cell would cause aberrant signaling which would cause the cell to fail the development process because CD4 and the zeta chain component are involved in the proper development of T cells from stem cells. As shown in FIG. 1, HSPCs transduced with a CAR construct comprising human CD4 fused to the CD3 zeta-signaling region on the T-cell receptor allows the differentiation of HIV-specific T cells in vivo and exhibit normal function in humanized mice. Specifically, human CD34+ HSCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the CD4\u03b6 CAR and eGFP reporter and these cells were implanted into humanized mice (NSG strain). Twelve weeks following implantation, peripheral blood was analyzed for expression of human CD45 and the eGFP reporter gene (left column) in mice that either received no vector (control) (top panel) and mice that received cells that were transduced (middle and bottom panels). In mice receiving vector transduced cells, vector expressing cells (middle panels) and cells not expressing vector (bottom panels) were analyzed for the human T cell marker CD3, human differentiation marker CD45 RO (middle column). Human T cells expressing CD3 were further analyzed for expression of CD4 and CD8 (right column). These results indicate that cells expressing the CD4\u03b6 CAR are capable of undergoing differentiation from stem cells into mature T cells. Surprisingly, CAR expression did not substantially alter the differentiation or lineage commitment of developing T-cells.",
                        "Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods of genetically engineering and enhancing the human cellular immune response against HIV, preferably Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), using CARs specific to HIV. These CARs are engineered T-cell receptors (TCRs) which comprise or consist of an HIV, preferably an HIV-1, envelope recognition domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain that direct T-cells to kill HIV-infected cells. As such, the CARs according to the present invention are freed from a drawback of natural TCRs for gene therapy\u2014HLA restriction.",
                        "Treatments according to the present invention include one-time dosing, or an infrequent procedure involving stem cell mobilization, purification, culture, lentiviral transduction, and infusion. Treatments may be by administration of a gene delivery vector, e.g., lentivirus, containing a gene encoding a CAR according to the present invention and/or administration of stem cells genetically modified to express one or more CARs according to the present invention. In some embodiments, the gene delivery vector is designed to deliver the gene into stem cells. In some embodiments, the stem cells are HSCs, HPCs, or both. In some embodiments, treatments according to the present invention do not suffer from low-levels of transduced cell engraftment that limits other stem cell therapeutic approaches due to the fact that, even at low stem cell engraftment frequencies, CAR-containing T-cells are expected to proliferate in the periphery in response to HIV, preferably HIV-1, antigens. This harnesses the natural proliferative capacity of stem cells and mature T cell progeny to generate key antiviral effector cells.",
                        "The methods of the present invention may be used to treat any infected subject, preferably mammalian subjects, more preferably human subjects, including those with HIV stably suppressed by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and/or clear latent viral reservoirs. In some embodiments, the subjects to be treated are those who are failing standard antiretroviral therapy due to drug resistance, unable to tolerate the complications or side effects of antiretroviral drugs, and/or unwilling or unable logistically to take life-long antiretroviral therapy.",
                        "According to the present invention, delivery of CARs to stem cells will provide a non-exhaustible source of CD4+ and CD8+ T and NK cells specific for HIV, preferably HIV-1, to recognize and kill cells infected with HIV in vivo, as opposed to natural cellular immunity that faces clonal exhaustion. Furthermore, T-cells made by the method of the present invention are superior to T-cells obtained using other methods in the art, because the CARs are HLA-independent, and are therefore broadly applicable to any person, and not subject to a key immune evasion strategy of HLA downregulation by HIV infected cells.",
                        "The genetic modification of HSCs with a CAR in subjects will result in the production of mature effector cells that can lower viral loads in the infected subjects and promote the eradication of the virus. Although there are a variety of models known in the art that can be employed to test and screen various embodiments of the present invention, the non-human primate model (NHP) of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection, which has been an important surrogate system in the understanding of HIV pathogenesis, disease progression, and in the development of antiretroviral therapeutic and vaccine strategies, may be employed as described herein.",
                        "SHIV chimeras are created by inserting HIV-1 genes, for instance env, rev, tat, and vpu, into a background of SIVmac. Such \u201cenv-SHIVs\u201d readily infect macaques, and offer all the advantages of the SIVmac/macaque model. An example of a SHIV chimera is the CCR5-tropic subtype C SHIV-1157ipd3N4 (referred to as SHIV-C). Infected macaques develop CD4+ T-cell loss usually in a few weeks and develop AIDS at intervals ranging from a few weeks to two years. Histological changes in lymphoid and other tissues closely resemble those seen in human AIDS. Thus, the SHIV/macaque model is a superb model to study novel HIV/AIDS treatment strategies.",
                        "The present invention offers several advantages over current therapeutic modalities. First, as it involves long-lived stem cells, treatments should require only a single administration. The risk of undesirable T-cell reactivity would be minimized, as stem cell-derived T-cells will pass through thymic selection. As both CD4 and CD8 cells arise from CAR-transduced stem cells, there will be both anti-HIV CD4-(helper) and CD8-(CTL) T-cell function. Finally, as new HIV/SHIV-specific cells are constantly renewed from stem cells, HIV production from activation of HIV/SHIV reservoir cells can be contained and prevented from systemic spread."

Humanized mice containing the HIV-TCR construct (SL-9) or control TCR were infected with the HIV reporter virus and were assessed for human CD45+ cells expressing HIV by flow cytometry for the HSA-HA marker gene encoded by the virus genome. As shown in FIG. 2, The HIV-TCR construct significantly suppresses HIV expressing cells in vivo.",

FIG. 3 schematically shows CD4\u03b6 CAR, which is a fusion molecule of human CD4 with the signaling domain of the CD3 complex \u03b6-chain. This harnesses CD4 as a recognition receptor for HIV gp120 envelope on the surface of infected cells; engagement of CD4 triggers T-cell recognition of infected cells through \u03b6-chain signaling.",

Surprisingly, the CD4\u03b6 CAR construct resulted in dramatically superior suppressive activity compared to the HIV-TCR construct, even when the CTL clone is matched.",

Unlike the HIV-specific TCR cells of FIG. 2, the data in FIG. 5 shows that the killing and suppressive activity of the cells having the CD4\u03b6 CAR construct is independent of HLA-I molecules. Thus, the methods and engineered cells according to the present invention are not HLA-restricted.",

The cells were then incubated with HIV-1 infected T1 cells. Intracellular IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were analyzed by flow cytometry.

The results demonstrate that CD8+ cells which were transduced with CD4\u03b6 CAR are susceptible to HIV infection whereas CD8+ T-cells transduced with control vector were not significantly infected by HIV (EGFP).",

The first shRNA, sh1005, inhibits R5-tropic HIV at the point of entry through downregulation of the CCR5 co-receptor. The second shRNA, sh516, directed to HIV itself, which unlike sh1005, has been found to be protective against both R5- and X4-tropic HIV.",

No effects on cell viability, no up-regulation of interferon-inducible OAS1 expression in PBMCs, and no effects on colony forming cell (CFC) assay after transduction of FL-CD34+ cells were seen. Hematopoiesis in transplanted BLT mice was normal in marked cell populations. Most importantly, marked cells are protected from both R5 and X4 tropic HIV. Thus, in some embodiments, this base vector may be used to test expression and functionality of other CARs.

The Triple CAR construct maintains ability to downregulate CCR5 and downregulate an HIV vector bearing mCherry as a reporter gene similar to sh1005/sh516 (data not shown).

Briefly, transduced CD34+ cells are re-suspended in MethoCult H4034 and 500 cells plated per replicate. 12-14 days later, CFUs are scored under a microscope. Individual colonies can also be assessed for vector copy number by PCR; one may aim to maintain a copy number less than 3.

Additionally, knockdown of CCR5 expression was observed in vector expressing cells in these animals, thereby indicating that the shRNA specific to CCR5 is functioning. Expression of the CD4\u03b6 CAR construct on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and myeloid cells was observed in transplanted animals, thereby indicating that the genetically modified HSCs are capable of multilineage hematopoiesis in vivo.",

In addition, as shown in FIG. 11D, co-incubation of these cells with HIV-infected cells resulted in the induction of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-y) compared to untransduced cells, thereby indicating that the CD4\u03b6 CAR is functionally capable of inducing antiviral responses when expressed on CD8+ T cells. Thus, the Triple CAR construct protects transduced cells from HIV infection as well as expresses the CD4\u03b6 CAR.",

After this infection time, virologic parameters and immune responses were assessed. Splenocytes from HIV-1 infected CD4\u03b6 CAR mice were accessed for na\u00efve (CD45RA+CD62L+), effector memory (EM) (CD45RA\u2212CD62L\u2212), central memory (CM) (CD45RA\u2212CD62L+) and effector memory RA (EMRA) (CD45RA+CD62L\u2212) development. Splenocytes from HIV-1 infected CD4\u03b6 CAR mice were accessed for expression of activation marker CD38+. As shown in FIG. 12A, HIV infection resulted in the appearance of CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells that possessed an effector phenotype (CD4+eGFP+CD27\u2212CD45RA+/\u2212) that is not represented in the non-CAR expressing cells. This was similar to the types of responses that were observed in studies examining HIV specific T cell responses utilizing a molecularly cloned TCR against HIV. In addition, as shown in FIG. 12B, these CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells have greater levels of the CD38 activation molecule, thereby indicating the functional recruitment of these cells in antigen-specific T cell responses to HIV. Cells were then assessed for virus-specific activation of antiviral responses during HIV infection. Cells were removed from infected animals and were then cultured with a virally infected cell line or with uninfected cells. Shortly following exposure, CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells produced INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in response to HIV infected cells and did not respond to uninfected cells. These results show that CD4\u03b6 CAR modified cells develop into effector phenotype and are activated after HIV infection and that cells carrying the CD4\u03b6 CAR were primed in vivo to elicit HIV specific T cell responses following antigen encounter.",

Expression of CD3, CD5, CD7 and T cell receptor \u03b1\u03b2 were assessed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Thymocytes from the CD4\u03b6 CAR mice and control GFP mice were assessed for their expression of CD5 and CD3 by flow cytometry. Thymocytes from the CD4\u03b6 CAR and control mice were sorted based on CD5+ and GFP expression. DNA was purified from the sorted cells and TCR rearrangement excision circle (TREC) were measured by real time PCR. CD3 expression on CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells was analyzed separately by high or low GFP expression. Interestingly, while the majority of cells that express the CD4\u03b6 CAR vector that develop in vivo are T cells, as determined by expression of CD5, CD7, or CD2, there is a significant population of cells that lack cell surface CD3\u03b5 expression. Further phenotypic analysis of this population indicates that these cells have lower levels of endogenous TCR\u03b1\u03b2 receptor expression, which is necessary for cell surface expression of CD3. These cells from animals transplanted with human HSC modified with the CD4\u03b6 CAR containing vector or a vector containing a deletion of the CD4\u03b6 CAR solely expressing the eGFP marker protein were examined. A decrease in cell surface CD3\u03b5 expression in cells expressing the CD4\u03b6 CAR/eGFP compared to cells expressing the eGFP control vector in the thymus of transplanted animals was observed. When these thymocytes were sorted and examined for the levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), as shown in FIG. 13A there was a significant decrease in TREC levels in CD4\u03b6 CAR vector expressing cells compared to control vector expressing cells, thereby resulting in an approximately 50% decrease in TREC levels. This indicates that endogenous T cell receptor rearrangement is shut down as a result or CD4\u03b6 CAR expression. FIG. 13B shows a reduction of CD3 expression on those cells expressing the greatest levels of the vector, thereby suggesting that higher levels of the CD4\u03b6 CAR on the surface of these developing cells more effectively turns off endogenous TCR rearrangement. In summary, these data indicate that genetic modification of human HSCs with a CD4\u03b6 CAR can result in multilineage hematopoiesis and the production of HIV specific T cells; a significant population of which that have their endogenous T cell receptor down regulated and solely express the CD4\u03b6 CAR molecule.",

Specifically, splenocytes from HIV-1 infected, CAR-transduced BLT mice were analyzed for intracellular gag expression among human CD45+ cells or CD45+GFP+ CD4\u03b6 CAR cells. As shown in FIG. 14, significantly reduced levels of p24Gag expression were observed in cells expressing the Triple CAR Construct than in cells not expressing the construct. This indicates that these cells are protected from infection through the expression of the antiviral genes in the construct, allowing them to persist and respond against HIV in vivo.",
                                "HIV viral load was assessed in PBMCs and suppression of virus in mice receiving the Triple CAR Construct was observed. The percentage of GFP+CD4+ CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells in peripheral blood before and 5 weeks after infection are accessed by flow cytometry. As shown in FIG. 15A, when mice reconstituted with different levels of CD4\u03b6 CAR expressing cells were analyzed, mice that had a greater expansion of cells expressing the CD4\u03b6 CAR vector (high expansion) had almost full suppression of HIV, whereas animals whose cells had lower levels of expansion did not have significant suppression of the virus. As shown in FIG. 15B, in addition to lower viral loads, a better preservation of CD4+ T cell ratios was observed in animals that had greater levels of cellular expansion of PBMC expressing the CD4\u03b6 CAR vector. FIG. 15C shows that the levels of cellular expansion correlated with suppression of the virus. In summary, CD4\u03b6 CAR cells successfully suppress HIV replication in vivo. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention is directed to genetically modifying HSCs, HPCs, or HSPCs with a gene delivery vector containing a sequence encoding a CD4\u03b6 CAR alone or in combination with one or more antiviral sequences such as a shRNA (e.g., sh1005 and/or sh516) to provide multilineage reconstitution of HIV-specific cells that are protected from HIV infection and/or lower viral loads in vivo following exposure to HIV.",

Each of these novel receptors can be produced in two versions: one with the CD3\u03b6 chain signaling domain, and another with a fusion of the CD3\u03b6 chain and the CD28 signaling domain. This \u201csecond generation CAR\u201d strategy may improve the survival and proliferation of CAR-transduced T-cells by providing a co-stimulatory \u201csecond signal\u201d in addition to the primary T-cell receptor signal.",
                                "Vectors containing second generation single-chain antibody CARs, in versions with either the CD28 or 4-1BB signaling domains in tandem with the CD3 \u03b6 chain were modified to allow convenient replacement of the single-chain domains with new single-chain genes. In brief, a portion including the Xba I-Sma I restriction sites (starting just upstream of the single-chain antibody and ending within the hinge region) was modified in a secondary vector (pUC19) by point mutagenesis (QuikChange, Invitrogen) to create an Apa I site in the hinge region through silent mutations. After confirmation of the correct sequence, the Xba I-Sma I restriction fragment was swapped into the vectors (also including a first generation version with only the CD3 \u03b6 chain).",
                                "FIG. 16 schematically shows the CAR vector modification and strategy to develop CAR constructs according to the present invention. A map of a CAR construct is shown. Within the Xba I-Sma I fragment, a silent mutation was introduced in the Hinge region to introduce an Apa I site (GGCC\u2192GGCC (SEQ ID NO:1)), and this fragment was re-introduced into the vector. One plasmid was generated for each version with different signaling domains (CD28-\u03b6, 4-1BB-\u03b6, and \u03b6). New CARs were generated by synthesizing the single chain antibody and partial hinge sequence including the Xba I and Apa I sites, and using those enzymes to cut and ligate the new constructs into the vector.",
                                "Using the three vectors described above (signaling domains: \u03b6, CD28-\u03b6, and 4-1BB-\u03b6) novel single chain antibodies designed from sequences of 7 well-defined broadly neutralizing antibodies (Table 1) were inserted. Thus, in some embodiments, second generation CAR constructs according to the present invention comprises a sequence which encodes one of the single chain antibody sequences set forth in Table 1 as follows:",
                                "The Xba I-Apa I inserts were custom synthesized (GeneArt) as concatenated heavy chain variable region with linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:16)) with light chain variable region, and then swapped into the three vectors. These 21 CAR constructs may be used to generate gene delivery vectors to be used in accordance with the present invention, for example, to transduce cells, e.g., stem cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, etc., for functional testing.",
                                "Truncation of CD4\u03b6 CAR is generated by mutagenesis PCR of the original CAR construct sequentially deleting CD4 D4 domain, D3-D4 domains, D2-D4 domains. Mutagenesis on the CD4 D1 domain may also be generated using mutagenesis PCR. FIG. 17 depicts the various truncation mutants that have been made. FIG. 18 demonstrates how a truncation mutant containing the D1 and D2 domains of CD4, described in FIG. 17, can reduce the ability of this CAR to allow HIV infection in the context of other protective genes, which include a CCR5-specific shRNA and HIV-LTR specific shRNA. These CAR constructs may be used to generate gene delivery vector to reduce binding of the CD4 component to MHCII. These CAR constructs may be used to generate gene delivery vectors to be used in accordance with the present invention as stated above."

Human HSPC can fully reconstitute human B-cell, T-cell, NK and myeloid lineages in an advanced humanized mouse model (bone marrow, fetal liver, fetal thymus-BLT mouse). The introduction of HIV-specific CARs into HSPC allows differentiation of these cells in vivo into both CD4 and CD8 mature T-cell types expressing the receptor. As disclosed herein, the surrogate humanized bone marrow, fetal liver and thymus (BLT) mouse model was to in initial experiments to demonstrate that human CD34+ HSPCs can be genetically modified with a lentiviral vector containing a molecularly cloned TCR specific to HIV, and subsequently develop into mature, fully functional CTL. Importantly these mature effector cells do not require any particular HLA molecule to attack target cells.",

A new population of stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells have been identified and exhibit stem-cell-like qualities of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation to memory and effector T-cell subsets. Human TSCM cells are a memory T-cell subset, but with a distinct phenotype and gene expression profile from TCM and TEM. They can be clonally expanded after antigenic stimulation, with enhanced abilities to proliferate and reconstitute and, importantly, can be serially transplanted in immunodeficient mice. These cells are multi-potent in generating TCM and TEM cells subsets in vitro. Thus, these cells exhibit a stem-cell-like behavior, consistent with properties of mouse TSCM cells that show enhanced self-renewal and multi-potency in serial transplantation experiments. Because of the long-term self-renewal properties and multi-potent differentiation properties, the TSCM are ideal for genetic engineering of T-cell effector activities. Using the methodology of Gattinoni, et al., the in vitro propagation of TSCM cells (CD8+/CD45RA+/CD45RO\u2212/CCR7+/CD62L+/CD95+/CD58+). 67% of TSCM differentiated to other subtypes including TEM (CD8+/CD45RA\u2212/CD45RO+/CCR7\u2212/CD62L\u2212) and TCM (CD8+/CD45RA\u2212/CD45RO+/CCR7+/CD62L+) subsets was achieved (data not shown).",
                                "TSCM represent a population of T-cells that do not require thymic development and transgene expression is limited to T-cell lineages only. The derivation of TSCM cells can be verified using methods known in the art. For example, CD45RA+na\u00efve T-cells are positively isolated from human peripheral blood and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the presence of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor, TWS119, to inhibit T-cell differentiation and IL-2 for 14 days. TSCM cells may be induced in about 5% of either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. TSCM population can be expanded from na\u00efve precursors in the presence of low doses of IL-7 and IL-15 (5 ng/ml each) following anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies stimulation. If desired, one can compare both protocols for expansion of gene modified TSCM cells. CD45RA and CD62L na\u00efve T-cells are FACS-sorted and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the presence (condition A) or absence (condition B) of IL-2 and TWS119 for 2 days. Cells are then transduced with DC CARs and cultured in the presence of either: IL-2 and TWS119 (condition A); or IL-7 and IL-15 (condition B) for 12 days. The function of transduced TSCM can be characterized after differentiation to TEM cells, e.g., with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 6 days and CTL, cytokine production, and proliferative activity against HIV using methods known in the art.",

For example, for TSCM derivation, T-cells are isolated from the spleen, thymic organoid, and/or peripheral blood of BLT mice and TSCM cells are cultured as previously described. After stimulation with anti-CD3/cd28 antibodies for two days, the cells are transduced with the CAR-containing vector marked with EGFP or, separately, with a control vector containing only EGFP and then cultured for a further 12 days. CD34+ HSPCs from fetal liver is also transduced with the CAR-containing vector or, separately, is transduced with a control vector containing only EGFP. One million of CAR vector-transduced cells or control vector containing cells from HSPCs and TSCM cells are separately infused intravenously into irradiated BLT mice. 6-8 weeks post-transplantation for mice receiving HSPC or TSCM cells, one may begin analyzing peripheral blood for EGFP expression and cellular lineage marker expression on CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD3\u2212CD56+ NK cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD11c+ dendritic cells every two weeks for 18 weeks (24 weeks post-transplant) to determine the maintenance of transduced cells.",

Preliminary data suggest that peripheral blood T-cells transduced with genes encoding the anti-gag TCR can kill latently infected cells induced to produce virus by addition of PKC activators (not shown). Consequently, CAR-expressing cells may be able to similarly eliminate activated reservoir cells. One may assess the ability of T-cells from BLT mice expressing CARs to kill reservoir cells ex vivo, using activated latently infected U1 cells as targets. One may obtain splenocytes from infected animals receiving CAR-transduced HSPC and control animals, and determine levels of activation-inducible (i.e., latent) infection by subjecting splenocytes to co-stimulation followed by analysis of intracellular gag p24 expression.

One may use high-throughput methods known in the art. For example, the lineage potential of individual HSPC clones can be determined by fractionation of T-cell (CD3+), B-cell (CD19+), and monocytes (CD14+) from spleen, bone marrow where a sufficient number of cells can be obtained for FACS sorting, followed by a PQCT assay for VIS tracking. One may utilize at least 5 animals transplanted for 20-25 weeks following transplant with CAR vector and controls. One may determine the relative number, frequency, and lineage distribution of clones using the PQCT assay. Due to antigen-driven immune cell proliferation, single or pauci-clonal outgrowth of normal transgenic T-cells may occur. This type of expansion can be distinguished from potential malignant transformation by a detailed investigation including blast analysis, karyotype and marker analysis, genomic position of VIS for oncogene activation, and by gene profile analysis. Vector and HIV integration sites can be distinguished by signature mutations within the LTR.

In some embodiments, these CARs are engineered T-cell receptors (TCRs) comprising or consisting of an HIV envelope recognition domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain that direct T-cells to kill HIV-infected cells. In some embodiments, the CARs are expressed within a lentiviral vector together with two shRNAs, sh1005 and sh516 and/or other gene reagents, which protect transduced cells from HIV infection.",

Transduction would be into either or both HSPC or TSCM. This therapy would work well at low-level transduced cell engraftment that limits other stem cell therapeutic approaches due to the fact that CAR-containing T-cells are expected to proliferate in the periphery in response to HIV antigens, like normal T-cells that start at a frequency of 1 per million. This harnesses the natural proliferative capacity of stem cells and mature T-cell progeny to generate key antiviral effector cells. Transplant could be further combined with engineering of HSPC with a lentiviral vector expressing only shRNAs to repopulate with a chimeric hematopoietic system consisting of an HIV-resistant immune system and CAR effector T-cells.",

Nevertheless, the impact of vector integration on gene expression and cell functions may be assayed using methods known in the heart. Additionally, one may monitor the repopulating clones using methods known in the art, e.g., VIS as described above.

To minimize shRNA off-target effects, one may specifically screened for potent shRNAs using transcriptionally weaker promoters (H1 and 7SK). No adverse effects have been observed of the dual sh1005/sh516 transduced T-cells in vitro or in HSPC during in vivo multi-lineage hematopoietic differentiation in BLT mice.",

Genes which are over-or under-expressed can be correlated through bioinformatics analysis with the genomic integration sites, cell surface markers assayed by flow cytometry, by canonical pathway analysis (Ingenuity) and homologies between sh1005 and sh516 and sequences within genes that are under-expressed analyzed by the BLAST program (//blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). One may use a vector without the EGFP reporter gene to utilize a vector suitable for clinical studies. One may follow vector-transduced cells through the identification of the specific CAR by flow cytometry or cellular labeling; for instance, flow cytometry for a specific immunoglobulin extracellular domain if characterizing a CAR that contains this in the HIV recognition domain."
