                        "Majority of carbon deposition methods based on gas discharge plasma require high vacuum below about 0.01 Torr, which requires expensive high-vacuum pumps. Such methods utilize sputtering of carbon targets by bombarding by high-energy positive ions in so-called physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, mostly in magnetron arrangements. Another kind of methods utilizes reactive carbon based species to deposit on substrates in plasmas containing hydrocarbon components. These methods are referred to as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) and require vacuum below about 0.01 Torr, too. There are, however, film deposition methods utilizing so-called hollow cathodes, where the active plasma can be generated up to atmospheric gas pressure and even higher. Very dense hollow cathode plasmas, both at low and high gas pressures, can be generated in cathodes utilizing auxiliary magnetic fields focusing the plasma at the outlet of the cathode hole. Linear magnetized hollow cathodes were disclosed by L. Bardos et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,602 and by H. Barankova et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,075.",
                        "Depending on their properties (hardness, thickness, structure, electrical conductivity) carbon-based coatings allow a number of applications. However, a general problem in deposition of carbon coatings on insulator substrates, like glass and ceramics, is their poor adhesion to the surface. For certain applications this problem can be solved using different interface films, for example thin tungsten, aluminum or silicon films. Without such interface films the adhesion is unsatisfactory. However, the interface film changes surface properties of the substrate and for some applications cannot be used.",

                        "Provided herein are methods and apparatuses for deposition of, for example, adherent carbon coatings on surfaces of insulator substrates (e.g., particularly on glass or ceramics, at gas pressure higher than about 0.01 Torr in a vacuum chamber, where simple mechanical pumps are sufficient to maintain the gas pressure). The methods described in the present disclosure are based on two subsequent phases, plasma pretreatment and plasma-assisted deposition of carbon coating. During plasma pretreatment the surface atoms on insulator substrates may acquire unsaturated bonds, which may lead to high surface reactivity and/or enhanced bonding with carbon particles formed during plasma deposition of carbon coatings in a dense hollow cathode generated plasma. The adherent carbon films can reach thicknesses of even more than ten micrometers, which is almost impossible without interface films in other methods. An additional advantage of the methods described herein is deposition by the hollow cathode plasma, which produces typically high density of charged particles and can perform very high rate of both PVD and PE CVD processes. Use of magnetic field causes better confinement of the plasma with reduced loss of charged particles. For the sake of purity of the coated films the interactions of plasmas with the substrate holder can be avoided or minimized in both pretreatment and deposition phases of the methods according to this invention. The substrate holder with substrates, the hollow cathodes or both can be moved with respect to each other, which can provide better uniformity of coating process. It is also possible to apply the pretreatment phase and the deposition phase of the present disclosure simultaneously, using an in-line arrangement of the plasma system with successively moving substrates on a moving holder. The substrate holder can also be provided with cooling and/or heating means.",

                        "Referring to FIGS. 1, 2a and 2b, an example of an apparatus for application of a method of deposition (e.g., at gas pressure higher than about 0.01 Torr) of adherent carbon coatings on surfaces of insulator substrates (e.g., particularly on glass or ceramics) in accordance with the present invention is described. The apparatus can comprise a chamber (e.g., vacuum chamber or hermetic chamber) 1. The chamber 1 may be pumped by one or more mechanical pumps 2 to a given gas pressure (e.g., total gas pressure). For example, the chamber 1 may be pumped by the one or more mechanical pumps 2 to a gas pressure of at least about 0.01 Torr. The apparatus comprises (e.g., the chamber 1 contains) a substrate holder 7 with insulator substrates 8, and a hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 in a magnetic field generated by rotatable magnets 4. The insulator substrates 8 can be positioned on or carried by the substrate holder 7. The hollow cathode 3 can have an opening or outlet oriented toward the insulator substrates 8. The rotatable magnets 4 can be provided on opposite lateral sides of the hollow cathode 3. The substrate holder 7 can be movable (e.g., linearly) with respect to the hollow cathode 3. Moving members (not shown) may therefore be provided for moving any one or both of the substrate holder 7 and the hollow cathode 3. The holder 7 can be arranged with magnets 9 that create an auxiliary magnetic field of at least about 0.01 Tesla at surfaces (e.g., upper surfaces) of the insulator substrates 8. The magnets 9 may be provided, for example, adjacent to or as part of (e.g., embedded in) the holder 7. The holder 7 can be provided with cooling and/or heating means (not shown). The holder 7 is electrically connected to a second power generator 11 by a switch for the second power (also \u201csecond power switch\u201d herein) 12 for generation of a pretreatment plasma 15 on the surfaces of the insulator substrates 8. The pretreatment plasma 15 is generated in at least one second gas 14 provided to the apparatus (e.g., admitted into the chamber 1). The apparatus comprises (e.g., the chamber 1 contains) at least one hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 facing the insulator substrates 8. The cathode 3 is connected to a first power generator 5 by a switch for the first power (also \u201cfirst power switch\u201d herein) 6 to generate a hydrocarbon-containing hollow cathode plasma 16 in a hydrocarbon-containing first gas 13 provided to the apparatus (e.g., admitted into the chamber 1) through the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3. The hydrocarbon-containing hollow cathode plasma 16 may be composed of carbon particles formed from the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3, of hydrogen and/or carbon atoms and/or molecules and/or hydrocarbon radicals in neutral, ionized and/or excited states (e.g., formed from the first gas 13), or of any combination thereof. In the pretreatment phase of the methods described herein the second gas 14 for the pretreatment plasma 15 can be provided to the apparatus (e.g., admitted into the chamber 1) by a separate inlet or through the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 (e.g., instead of the first gas 13), or in parts using both ways. The second gas 14 admitted through each inlet may or may not be the same. The second gas (e.g., an individual second gas among several second gases) 14 can comprise one or more noble gases (e.g., argon, neon, krypton, xenon, and/or helium), hydrogen, or any combination thereof. The second gas 14 can be a mixture (e.g., a mixture containing one or more noble gases, hydrogen, or any combination thereof). The second gas 14 can comprise, for example, hydrogen, argon and/or other noble gases. The second gas 14 can comprise, for example, argon, neon, krypton, xenon, helium, hydrogen, or any combination thereof. For plasma pretreatment of insulator substrates 8 the second power generator 11 can deliver an AC power preferably with a frequency higher than about 1 kilohertz (kHz), 10 kHz, 100 kHz, 250 kHz, 500 kHz, 750 kHz, 1 megahertz (MHz), 5 MHz or 10 MHz. The first power generator 5 for generation of hydrocarbon-containing hollow cathode plasma 16 in the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 can be configured to generate DC, pulsed DC, AC, pulsed AC, radio frequency or pulsed radio frequency power.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2a, an example of a first phase of the method of deposition of adherent carbon coatings on surfaces of insulator substrates (e.g., particularly on glass or ceramics) is described. In the first phase (also \u201cpretreatment phase\u201d herein) a plasma pretreatment of surfaces of the insulator substrates 8 on the substrate holder 7 can create unsaturated bonds of surface atoms, particularly silicon or aluminum, on the insulator substrates 8 in the pretreatment plasma 15 generated by the second power generator 11 delivering an AC power to the substrate holder 7 in an auxiliary magnetic field of at least about 0.01 Tesla generated by the magnets 9 in the at least one second gas 14. In this first phase the second power generator 11 is connected to the substrate holder 7 by the switch for the second power 12, and the first power generator 5 is disconnected from the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3. To avoid possible contamination of surfaces of the insulator substrates 8 by particles from the substrate holder 7 during pretreatment in the pretreatment plasma 15, for example by sputtering of the surface of the substrate holder 7, the insulator substrates 8 can be positioned on a shielding 10 on the substrate holder 7 to shield the surface of the substrate holder 7 from the pretreatment plasma 15. The shielding (also \u201cshielding on the substrate holder\u201d herein) 10 can comprise or be of the same material as the insulator substrates 8 and/or one or more other suitable materials (e.g., any other material capable of preventing release of and/or contamination by particles from the substrate holder 7).",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2b, an example of a second phase of the method of deposition of adherent carbon coatings on surfaces of insulator substrates (e.g., particularly on glass or ceramics) is described. In the second phase (also \u201cdeposition phase\u201d herein) a deposition of carbon coatings is performed on pretreated surfaces (e.g., the upper surfaces) of the insulator substrates 8 using the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 connected to the first power generator 5 by the switch for the first power 6, by, for example, physical vapor deposition (PVD) where carbon particles from the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode 3) are depositing (e.g., forming a coating) on the insulator substrates 8, simultaneously with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE CVD) from the hydrocarbon-containing hollow cathode plasma 16 generated in the first gas 13 containing hydrocarbons and flowing through the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3. The first gas 13 can comprise one or more noble gases, one or more hydrocarbons (e.g., volatile hydrocarbons), or any combination thereof. The first gas 13 can comprise, for example, argon, neon, krypton, xenon, helium, acetylene, methylacetylene, methane, ethane, propane, butane, ethylene, propylene, or any combination thereof. The first gas 13 can be composed of, for example, a mixture of at least one noble gas with acetylene, methane, ethane and/or one or more other volatile hydrocarbons. In the second phase the second power generator 11 is disconnected from the substrate holder 7 by the switch for the second power 12. To avoid possible contamination of growing films on surfaces of the insulator substrates 8 by particles from the substrate holder 7 during deposition in the hydrocarbon-containing hollow cathode plasma 16, for example by sputtering of the surface of the substrate holder 7 or by plasma reactive processes on the holder, the insulator substrates 8 can be positioned on the shielding 10 on the substrate holder 7 to shield the surface of the substrate holder 7 from the plasma 16. The second phase of the method can be started at the end of the first phase, or even before finishing of the first phase. In some cases both phases of the method according to this invention can be carried out simultaneously. In this case the second power generator 11 forms an AC bias on the surfaces of the insulator substrates 8 during deposition of carbon films. The second power generator 11 can deliver less than or equal to about 50% of the power from the first power generator 5.",

In this example the rotatable magnets 4 at the hollow cathode (e.g., graphite hollow cathode) 3 are removed and the cathode works without variable focusing magnetic field. This example also shows that the magnets 9 can be rotatable magnets in place of stationary magnets. Changes in intensity and geometry of magnetic field (e.g., generated by the magnets 9) can improve uniformity of the plasma pretreatment of substrates 8.",

For example, the hollow cathodes may have openings or outlets oriented toward the insulator substrate(s) 8 and the geometry of the openings or outlets may correspond to (e.g., follow) the geometry of the insulator substrate(s) 8.
