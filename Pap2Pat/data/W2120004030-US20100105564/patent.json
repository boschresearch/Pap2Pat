                        "Breast cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries1. Although disease-related mortality has declined due to earlier diagnosis and adjuvant therapies, identification of patients at increased risk of recurrence, targeting them for more aggressive systemic therapy, remains a significant challenge. One of the challenges is still to identify patients at risk of relapse and the desire to not overtreat. Options for advanced disease are limited. Recent technological advances now permit the systematic genomic characterization of tumors, enhancing our understanding of cancer causes and progression2-4. Gene expression signatures have been identified that classify breast tumors into subtypes exhibiting distinct expression profiles and associated with specific clinical outcomes4. Transcriptional signatures have been identified for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (luminal), HER2-positive (ERBB2-amplified), and ER/PR/HER2-negative (basal) breast cancer4. Predictors of metastasis in breast cancer are becoming available for use in the clinic2,5. Such prognostic gene expression signatures and predictors have generally been derived from tissues that include both tumor and stroma. Although some investigators have isolated and analyzed specific cell types or examined stroma-based gene expression signatures from cell culture experiments6-11, most have used whole tissue consisting of tumor cells and the surrounding tissue environment, where samples with <50% tumor cells are generally excluded3,4,12.",
                        "Gene expression in isolated tumor stroma from clinical breast cancer samples has not been examined; therefore, it is important to elucidate the specific contribution of stroma to tumor progression. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression13,14. However, the exact mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood15-17.",
                        "There is thus a need for a new method or system to predict outcome recurrence for patients with cancers such as breast cancer, with greater accuracy, ease and convenience. The present invention seeks to meet this and related needs."

The inventors have compared gene expression profiles from laser capture-microdissected tumor-associated versus matched normal stroma, and have derived transcriptional or reference expression profiles strongly associated with clinical outcome. Based on the outcome associated profiles derived from tumor associated stroma, the inventors have developed a prognostic tool for predicting clinical outcome. Disclosed herein is a stroma-derived prognostic predictor (SDPP) that provides new information to stratify disease outcome in breast cancer patients, independent of standard clinical prognostic factors and previously published predictors. The SDPP selects poor-outcome patients from multiple clinical subtypes, including lymph node-negative patients, and predicts outcome in multiple published expression data sets generated from whole tumor tissue. The SDPP has increased accuracy with respect to previously published predictors and prognostic accuracy increases upon predictor integration. Genes represented in the SDPP gene sets reveal the strong prognostic capacity of differential immune responses as well as angiogenic and hypoxic responses.",

The SDPP compares the expression level of 5 or more genes of a SDPP gene set in a sample of a breast cancer patient to the reference expression profile of the genes, the reference expression profile being associated with a disease outcome class, and predicts disease outcome according to the probability of falling within the disease outcome class defined by the reference expression profile of the SDPP genes.",

The SDPP predictor includes the correct weighting of genes. The SDPP provides a number of \u201cSDPP gene sets\u201d and the correct weighting of each gene in the gene set. The SDPP is useful for a variety of methods including methods for predicting clinical outcome, recurrence and metastasis, classifying and stratifying patients and tumors according to clinical outcome, diagnosing cancer subtype and/or providing a prognosis wherein the prognosis is good, mixed (alternatively referred to as uncertain) or poor.

In a preferred embodiment, the hybridization is under high stringency conditions. Appropriate stringency conditions which promote hybridization are known to those skilled in the art, or can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1 6.3.6. For example, 6.0\u00d7 sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45\u00b0 C., followed by a wash of 2.0\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. may be employed.",
                                "The stringency may be selected based on the conditions used in the wash step. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a high stringency of about 0.2\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be at high stringency conditions, at about 65\u00b0 C.",
                                "By \u201cat least moderately stringent hybridization conditions\u201d it is meant that conditions are selected which promote selective hybridization between two complementary nucleic acid molecules in solution. Hybridization may occur to all or a portion of a nucleic acid sequence molecule. The hybridizing portion is typically at least 15 (e.g. 20, 25, 30, 40 or 50) nucleotides in length. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the stability of a nucleic acid duplex, or hybrids, is determined by the Tm, which in sodium containing buffers is a function of the sodium ion concentration and temperature (Tm=81.5\u00b0 C.\u221216.6 (Log 10[Na+])+0.41(% (G+C)\u2212600/l), or similar equation). Accordingly, the parameters in the wash conditions that determine hybrid stability are sodium ion concentration and temperature. In order to identify molecules that are similar, but not identical, to a known nucleic acid molecule a 1% mismatch may be assumed to result in about a 1\u00b0 C. decrease in Tm, for example if nucleic acid molecules are sought that have a >95% identity, the final wash temperature will be reduced by about 5\u00b0 C. Based on these considerations those skilled in the art will be able to readily select appropriate hybridization conditions. In preferred embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions are selected. By way of example the following conditions may be employed to achieve stringent hybridization: hybridization at 5\u00d7 sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC)/5\u00d7Denhardt's solution/1.0% SDS at Tm-5\u00b0 C. based on the above equation, followed by a wash of 0.2\u00d7SSC/0.1% SDS at 60\u00b0 C. Moderately stringent hybridization conditions include a washing step in 3\u00d7SSC at 42\u00b0 C. It is understood, however, that equivalent stringencies may be achieved using alternative buffers, salts and temperatures. Additional guidance regarding hybridization conditions may be found in: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., 1989, 6.3.1-6.3.6 and in: Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, Vol. 3.",

These genes include adrenomedulin, interleukin 8, CXCL1, MMP12 and MMP1. Stromal changes during breast cancer progression may include the induction of hypoxia, which promotes recruitment of immune cells and endothelial cells, providing growth and matrix remodeling factors as well as a new blood supply for the tumor. Local activation of fibroblasts enhances matrix remodeling, facilitating tumor cell invasion.

                                "To investigate changes in breast tumor-associated stroma LCM-based tissue isolation and RNA amplification were combined with gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays23. LCM was used to collect cells from the stromal compartment within the tumor bed and within adjacent normal tissue from 53 patients presenting with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (Table 1). From 31 of these patients, data was obtained for matched tumor-associated and normal stroma. In order to determine whether gene expression in tumor-associated stroma could identify patient subtypes as has previously been observed in analysis using whole tissue4, a class discovery approach was applied. Therefore, a list of genes whose expression showed the most variation between the matched tumor versus normal stroma expression was generated for the 31 tissue-matched patients. The 200 most variable genes (Table 2) were used to cluster the complete data set of 53 patient tumor stroma samples (FIG. 1a-i). This class discovery analysis identified three patient clusters (FIG. 1b). One cluster (good outcome, FIG. 1b, 1c) has a significantly reduced rate of recurrence and longer relapse-free survival (RFS) (p=7.26e-3 and p=4.17e-3, respectively, c2 test for association), while a second patient cluster (poor outcome, FIG. 1b, 1c) has a significantly increased rate of recurrence and shorter RFS (p=2.04e-5 and p=2.87e-4, respectively). The third (FIG. 1b, lc) contains patients with mixed outcomes. Unlike similar analyses using breast cancer datasets derived from whole tissue where patients cluster predominantly based on ER and HER2 status30, multivariate Cox regression indicates that the poor outcome patient cluster identified by stromal gene expression is independent of ER, HER2 and lymph node status, as well as age and grade, (FIG. 1d). Hence the stroma-derived patient clusters are distinct from previously identified breast tumor subtypes4.",
                                "**Good and Poor Outcome Patient Stroma Exhibits Distinct Biological Responses**",
                                "The tri-partition of the patients by stromal expression profiles may represent three subtypes of breast tumor-associated stroma (FIG. 1b). To investigate if the differences between these patient groups reflect distinct biological responses that can be used to distinguish between the patient subgroups, genes differentially expressed between each patient cluster were identified. Using the complete unmatched tumor stroma gene expression data from the 53 patients, pairwise comparisons of gene expression between the three patient clusters were performed (FIG. 1a-ii). From this class distinction, 163 distinct genes were identified that have the greatest differences in expression between clusters (FIG. 2, Tables 3, 4, 5). Using this gene set, patients cluster by outcome in a manner similar to that previously generated by class discovery (FIG. 2a, b). The 163-gene set was then used as a starting point to characterize the differences between the good and poor outcome-associated stroma subtypes at the molecular level. These 163 genes cluster into three distinct groups (FIG. 2a, gene clusters identified as 1, 2 and 3).",
                                "Each stroma patient subtype (FIG. 2a, good, poor and mixed-outcome patient clusters) contains several genes whose expression is elevated in that subtype and which are involved in distinct biological responses, providing evidence that each stromal subtype reflects different biologies. For example, gene cluster 2 (FIG. 2c) contains 102 genes specifically elevated in the poor-outcome patient cluster. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these genes (FIG. 7) identifies an enrichment for functions and processes previously associated with poor outcome31\u203232. These genes include factors associated with an angiogenic response, such as adrenomedullin (ADM), interleukin 8 (IL8) and CXCL133-35. Supporting the link to angiogenesis, patients within our poor outcome cluster exhibit the highest levels of endothelial content, as established by immunostaining with the endothelial marker CD31 (FIG. 8 b, c, d). Several matrix metalloproteinase genes are highly expressed in poor vs good outcome, (MMP12 and MMP1 respectively, poor vs good 15.6 and 3.59-fold differential expression, respectively, pvalues<1e-1 and 0.0014, respectively). MMP1 and MMP12 are known factors involved in tissue remodeling by macrophages. MMP1 is also linked to angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis36. Additionally, adrenomedullin has been previously identified as part of a hypoxia transcriptional response19.",

GO analysis demonstrates enrichment for genes involved in the Th1-type immune response, including T-cell selection and differentiation, MHC class I receptor activity, and granzyme NB activity (FIG. 7). This implies that increased recruitment of activated T-cells and NK (natural killer) cells occurs in these tumors (FIG. 2a, good outcome cluster). Using immunohistochemistry it was confirmed that elevated levels of CD8 and CD3Z-positive cells are present in sections of tumor-associated stroma from patients in the good versus poor outcome-linked clusters (FIG. 5 a, b).",

                                "Based on the 163-gene signature of tumor-associated stroma subtypes, a minimal subset of these genes was identified that can act as a predictor of outcome. Many factors known to have prognostic value for breast cancer outcome, such as ER or HER2 status, can significantly affect tumor gene expression profiles4. To limit the influence of these effects, genes predictive of outcome independent of these factors were identified. Multivariate logistic regression, with ER, PR, HER2 and lymph node status as covariates, was used to rank genes from most to least significant by their independent prognostic ability (FIG. 1a, iii, see Materials and Methods). Thus genes at the top of this list (Table 3) are more likely to be independent predictors of outcome. To construct a multivariate predictor of outcome, a multivariate na\u00efve Bayes classifier was trained using incrementally larger gene sets from the ordered list (Table 3, FIG. 1a-iv). Each classifier was evaluated using 50 cross-validation runs, randomly splitting the data into testing and training sets. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the classifiers. Although there were a number of predictors with similar performance (FIG. 6 a), the predictor that maximized the AUC contained 26 genes (FIG. 1a-v) and performed well only in tumor-associated stroma (FIG. 6 c, d, e). [Notably, these genes contain representatives from each of the three gene clusters (gene clusters 1, 2 and 3) identified from the 163-gene set (FIG. 2a). Expression of selected genes within the predictor was validated by quantitative real-time PCR and significant correlations were found with array data (FIG. 5 d). Attempts to identify highly accurate predictors using other, more parsimonious, approaches to this problem failed. For example, predictors learnt directly from the list of differentially expressed genes between good and poor outcome patients had significantly less predictive ability than the 26-gene set learned from the 163-gene stroma signature.",

                                "Previous analyses have derived predictors for outcome from data derived from whole breast tumor tissue, containing tumor and stroma3,12. To establish whether our SDPP could successfully predict outcome in such data, several breast cancer datasets were examined. Two large publicly available examples have been analyzed extensively (van de Vijver et al.18 (NKI) and Wang et al.12) (FIG. 1a-vi). The NKI dataset consists of 295 IDC breast cancer samples with mixed ER, PR, HER2, and lymph node status, while the Wang et al. dataset contains 286 lymph node-negative cases. Only a subset of genes from the SDPP predictor were present on the arrays used for each of these datasets (15/26 for NKI and 19/26 for Wang et al.). Using these genes, the outcome of each sample using the SDPP classifier was predicted (FIG. 4a, d respectively; good, mixed, poor). In both datasets, patients assigned to the poor-outcome group by our SDPP are at significantly increased risk of recurrence and death from disease when compared to patients in the other two groups (FIG. 4 b,c.e) demonstrating the utility and robustness of the predictor in data derived from whole tissue. Moreover, since all patients in the Wang et al.12 dataset were node-negative, our analysis demonstrates that gene expression in tumor-associated stroma is predictive of outcome prior to node involvement.",

Although the mixed-outcome group was enriched for ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors, the good and poor outcome groups identified by the SDPP were composed of tumors with mixed ER and HER2 status (FIG. 9 c). In addition, the SDPP identifies good vs. poor outcome patients in both ER-positive and HER2-positive patient cohorts (FIG. 4 b, c, e, dashed lines, parentheses). In multivariate analyses, the SDPP was independent of classical clinical risk factors including ER and HER2 status, lymph node involvement, grade and age (FIG. 9 a, b), demonstrating that the SDPP is a novel predictor that identifies patients at risk of relapse independent of classical clinical risk factors.",

Genes within this predictor have been identified as involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion3,37. In addition, signatures have been developed that reflect biological responses in vitro19,20. For example, the concept of tumors as \u201cwounds that do not heal\u201d led to the identification of a wound response signature derived from the response of stromal fibroblasts in culture to serum stimulation20. Similarly, since tumors undergo adaptation to hypoxia in response to decreased oxygen, a hypoxia-associated transcriptional response was derived from cell culture studies19. Interestingly, both of these signatures can predict outcome in different cancer types19,20.",

Previous predictors have not specifically investigated the biological processes that occur in stroma. Such insight is essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies. SDPP, based on differential gene expression patterns in tumor-associated stroma, forecasts disease outcome with greater accuracy than do predictors based on whole tissue, suggesting that gene expression in tumor associated stroma modulates progression and outcome. Multiple biological responses are differentially reflected within the stroma of patients in different outcome categories.",
                                "Tumor associated stroma samples comprising the good-outcome patient cluster (FIG. 2a) overexpress a distinct set of immune-related genes relative to the other clusters, including T-cell and NK-cell markers indicative of a Th1-type immune response. This is consistent with previous work reporting a correlation between increased memory Th1 cell content and good outcome in colon cancer38. In contrast, this response is significantly diminished in patients of the poor outcome cluster (FIG. 2a). Stroma from poor outcome patients exhibits elevated expression of macrophage chemoattractants and macrophage scavenger receptors (FIG. 8a), supporting a Th2-type immune response39\u20324\u00b0. This is associated with poor outcome in animal models of breast cancer, including the polyoma middle-T model where type II macrophages stimulate invasion and metastasis by tumor cells41-43.",

VEGF, CXCL1 and EDN2 are chemoattractants able to recruit monocytes to the tumor site40, where they may differentiate into type II macrophages. Two additional genes elevated in this cluster of patients, MSR1 (macrophage scavenger receptor 1) and MARCO (macrophage scavenger receptor with collagenous structure) (FIG. 8 a), are markers of type II macrophages40,44. In addition, the poor-outcome patient cluster exhibits increased markers for endothelial cells (FIG. 8 b-d), confirming previous reports that increased blood vessel density correlates with poor clinical outcome45,46. A significantly higher blood vessel density in tissues from patients was observed in the mixed and poor clusters vs. patients in the good cluster (FIG. 1a).",

In order to compare the good and poor-outcome classes of each predictor, cases predicted as mixed or intermediate outcome for the SDPP and wound signatures, respectively, were removed for training.

For this a graphical modeling approach was applied (See Materials and Methods, FIG. 9 f). Using the NKI data set, and predictions from the 70-gene predictor, wound response and hypoxia signatures, and the SDPP, a Bayes' classifier of metastasis was constructed. From this analysis, the 70-gene, hypoxia, and wound response signatures each have a posterior probability of metastasis of less than 50%, whereas the SDPP has a posterior probability of metastasis of 56% (FIG. 5g) demonstrating the increased accuracy of the SDPP. Notably, combining the SDPP with any of the predictors improves the prediction of metastasis beyond that of any of the predictors alone, and beyond any combination of predictors that does not include the SDPP (FIG. 9 g, black points). Comparable improvements were observed when the SDPP is combined with other predictors to predict good outcome (FIG. 9 g, grey points). These results demonstrate an interaction between the biological processes underlying the predictors and highlight the increased prognostic power to be derived from an integrative approach.",

Thus, distinct gene expression signatures in breast tumor stroma reflect different clinical outcomes, which are not restricted to a specific clinical subtype. The stroma-specific signature presented here, alone or in combination with other molecular prognostic predictors, promises to improve molecular classification and prediction of outcome in breast cancer, specifically for the identification of patients that may benefit from adjuvant or aggressive therapies. Additional information is derived from the SDPP, beyond that provided by classical clinical risk factors or published molecular signatures. This, in combination with the improved accuracy provided by a combinatorial approach, clearly highlights the need to fully integrate all aspects of the tumor microenvironment into prognostic prediction and may suggest future avenues of investigation for the development of additional targeted therapeutic modalities."

                                "The cluster of stroma associated with poor outcome expressed elevated levels of adrenomedullin, a pro-angiogenic factor, as well as decreased levels of HOXA10, a transcription factor whose expression in breast cancer cells has been shown to lead to a decrease in invasive phenotype5253. This cluster also shows a decrease in a number of proteins often downregulated in gastric tumors, including OGN and HRASLS5455. Furthermore, this group shows a decrease in expression of a number of T-cell markers and natural killer cell markers, including granzyme A, CD8A, and CD3Z. There is also decreased expression of CD48, a B-cell activation marker, as well as decreased expression of CD52, a lymphocyte and monocyte antigen important in the complement-mediated immune response. Interestingly, the combination of elevated angiogenic factors and decreased T-cell markers is predictive of poor prognosis in both the presently generated dataset and the publicly available breast cancer dataset (FIG. 11, FIG. 14).",
