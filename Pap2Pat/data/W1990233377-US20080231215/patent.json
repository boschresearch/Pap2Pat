The study for practical use of various techniques using characteristics such as high orientation, high intensity, high polarization by setting a light source that generates this synchrotron radiation at a straight section of an electron storage ring. In the electron storage ring of nowadays, many undulators that are high-intensity light sources each having a smaller beam section and higher beam directivity are provided.",
                        "This undulator adopts a construction in which a first magnetic circuit and a second magnetic circuit are oppositely arranged through a space to form a periodic magnetic field through which an electron beam passes as shown in the following Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-206296 or In-vacuum undulators of SPring-8, T. Hara, T. Tanaka, T. Tanabe, X. M. Marechal, S. Okada and H. Kitamura: J. Synchrotron Radiation 5, 403 (1998) and Construction of an in-vacuum undulator for production of undulator x-rays in the 5-25 KeV region. S. Yamamoto, T. Shioya, M. Hara, H. Kitamura, X. W. Zhang, T. Mochizuki, H. Sugiyama and M. Ando; Rev. Sci. Instrum. 61 (1992) 400. In order to generate the periodic magnetic field, each of the first and second magnetic circuits includes many arranged permanent magnets. When a strong magnetic field is to be generated, the first magnetic circuit and the second magnetic circuit are to be brought close to each other, so that an interval (gap) of the space can be narrowed and the magnetic field is intensified. Thus, a construction in which the first magnetic circuit and the second magnetic circuit are contained in a vacuum chamber is adopted. In this construction, there is an advantage such that the gap can be narrowed as compared with a construction in which a vacuum chamber is provided between a first magnetic circuit and a second magnetic circuit.",
                        "However, even when the gap is narrowed as described above, there is a limit in characteristics of the permanent magnet. In addition, when the gap is narrowed too much, there arises a new problem such that the permanent magnet is demagnetized due to radiation generated when the electron beam impinges on the permanent magnet. Therefore, there is a limit of intensifying the magnetic field only by a method of narrowing the gap."

In order to form a periodic magnetic field, the first magnetic circuit and the second magnetic circuit are arranged oppositely with the space therebetween. The first magnetic circuit is supported by the first support body and the second magnetic circuit is supported by the second support body. The first and second magnetic circuits are in-vacuumed in the vacuum chamber. When an electron beam is passed through the space in which the periodic magnetic field is generated, the synchrotron radiation can be generated. Each of the first and second magnetic circuits includes permanent magnets and the cooling mechanism for cooling the permanent magnet below the room temperature. When the permanent magnet is cooled, there appear characteristics in which a remanent flux density (Br) and magnetic coercive force (designated by iHc which is a value of H when an I-H curve (demagnetization curve) crosses an H axis and called intrinsic magnetic coercive force) are increased. When the remanent flux density is increased, magnetic characteristics are improved, so that an intense magnetic field can be formed in the space. In addition, when the magnetic coercive force is increased, it is known that radiation-proof characteristics are improved. As a result, when the first magnetic circuit and the second magnetic circuit are formed oppositely with the space therebetween, there can be provided an undulator in which the magnetic field formed in the space can be intensified and the radiation-proof characteristics can be improved.",
                                "Conventionally, the magnetic circuit is cooled by circulating hot water having a temperature about 120\u00b0 C. in a baking process so that the permanent magnet may not be heated up to a predetermined temperature or more, and by circulating cooling water having a temperature about the room temperature so that the temperature of the magnetic circuit may not become unstable by the heat from the electron beam when the magnetic circuit is used.",

In addition, the magnetic circuit can be easily assembled when it is incorporated. As the cooling mechanism, the refrigerant passing tube for passing the refrigerant is provided and this is connected to the first support body and the second support body by the connecting component. Therefore, the magnetic circuit supported by the support body can be cooled through the connecting component. Furthermore, since the connecting component has flexibility, even when the gap of the space is changed (even when the first and second support bodies are moved) with the refrigerant passing tube fixed, movement is easy.",

By changing the gap, intensity of the magnetic field can be adjusted. When the permanent magnets are arranged as shown in FIG. 2, a periodic magnetic field can be formed in the space 13. When the electron beam is passed through the space 13, the electron beam is affected by the periodic magnetic field and goes through like snake. A weaving surface M of the electron beam is parallel to magnet surfaces of the opposed first and second magnetic circuits. When the electron beam weavs through it, a desired synchrotron radiation can be generated.",

FIG. 2 is constituted by the permanent magnets only, a soft magnet is disposed between permanent magnets in a so-called hybrid type of magnetic circuit as shown in FIG. 3. That is, a first magnetic circuit includes permanent magnets 11A and 11C and soft magnetic material 11B and 11D which are alternatively arranged, and a second magnetic circuit includes permanent magnets 12A and 12C and soft magnetic material 12B and 12D which are alternately arranged. Each magnetization direction (direction of a magnetic flux) is shown by an arrow. According to the undulator of the present invention, any magnetic circuit may be used and it is not limited to a magnetic circuit having a specific construction."

FIG. 1 is the transverse sectional view showing the undulator cut along a surface perpendicular to the traveling direction of the electron beam. The first magnetic circuit 11 and the second magnetic circuit 12 are oppositely arranged with the space 13 therebetween. As described above with reference to FIG. 2, according to the first magnetic circuit 11, many permanent magnets \u201cm\u201d are arranged along the traveling direction of the electron beam (direction perpendicular to a sheet surface of FIG. 1). Similarly, many permanent magnets \u201cm\u201d are arranged in the second magnetic circuit 12. A concrete example of a preferred permanent magnet \u201cm\u201d will be described below.",

The first support body 21 includes a first magnet holder 21a (corresponding to a holder) and a first magnet mounting beam 21b (corresponding to a holder support). Conventionally, since the temperature is heated up to a high temperature in a baking process, the first magnet holder 21a is formed of oxygen free copper and the first magnet mounting beam 21b is formed of aluminum. However, according to the present invention, both are formed of oxygen free copper. As will be described below, when the magnetic circuits II and 12 are cooled, although both magnet holder 21a and the magnet mounting beam 21b shrink, since they are formed of the same material, the magnet holder 21a is not deformed by the shrinkage in size. Therefore, even when the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 are cooled, the permanent magnet \u201cm\u201d is not deformed and not damaged.",
                                "In addition, the first magnet holder 21a may be formed of aluminum and the first magnet mounting beam 21b may be formed of oxygen free copper. In this case also, since a thermal expansion coefficient of aluminum is higher than that of oxygen free copper, even when the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 are cooled, they are not deformed in a damaging direction.",

There is provided a refrigerant passing tube 30 through which a refrigerant is passed, that is, a pair of refrigerant passing tubes 30 are provided on both lateral sides of the space 13. Although the refrigerant is not limited to a specific one, it is preferable that the refrigerant is a liquefied refrigerant such as liquid nitrogen or liquid helium. The refrigerant passing tube 30 is also arranged in the traveling direction of the electron beam. The refrigerant is circulated through a predetermined circulation path.",
                                "The refrigerant passing tube 30 and each of the first and second support bodies 21 and 22 are connected through connecting components 31. The connecting component 31 has a configuration having flexibility (which can be accordion-folded as shown in the drawing below), so that even when the first and second support bodies 21 and 22 are vertically moved, the connection state between each of the first and second support bodies 21 and 22 and the refrigerant passing tube 30 can be maintained. The connecting component 31 is formed of a conductor having high thermal conductivity (copper (oxygen free copper or beryllium copper) and aluminum, for example). In addition, the refrigerant passing tube 30 is fixed.",
                                "Although the connecting component 31 is made flexible for the above reason, it is made flexible with the purpose of further providing thermal resistance to some extent. When the thermal resistance is provided, temperature control can be performed with higher precision as will be described below.",

The temperature to be set varies according to a kind of refrigerant to be used or a kind of permanent magnet \u201cm\u201d which constitutes the magnetic circuits 11 and 12.",
                                "Hereinafter, a description will be made of an effect provided by cooling the permanent magnet \u201cm\u201d. As general characteristics of the permanent magnet, a remanent flux density \u201cBr\u201d becomes high as the permanent magnet is cooled. By using this characteristics, a strong magnetic field can be generated in the space 13. In addition, when the permanent magnet is cooled, its magnetic coercive force is increased. Thus, its radiation-proof characteristics are enhanced. Furthermore, when the permanent magnet is cooled, desorption of a gas molecule from a surface of the permanent magnet in a vacuum chamber 1 is reduced. Therefore, ultrahigh vacuum can be implemented in the vacuum chamber 1 without performing the baking process for the magnetic circuits 11 and 12. Although they are heated up to a predetermined temperature when the baking process is performed, a problem such as heat demagnetization is generated when the permanent magnet is heated. Therefore, conventionally, it is necessary to select a material having high magnetic coercive force and a low remanent flux density at the room temperature for the permanent magnet in view of the heat demagnetization in the baking process. However, according to the present invention, since it is not necessary to consider such heat demagnetization, a material having low magnetic coercive force and a high remanent flux density at the room temperature can be selected, so that a strong magnetic field can be generated in the space 13.",
                                "The first and second magnetic circuits 11 and 12 are in-vacuumed in the vacuum chamber 1. When the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 are in-vacuumed in the vacuum chamber 1, the gap \u201cg\u201d can be small. In addition, since a heat shielding effect can be provided when they are in-vacuumed, the heat in a room where the undulator R is set can be prevented from being transferred to the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 through the vacuum chamber 1.",
                                "The first and second support bodies 21 and 22 supporting the first and second magnetic circuits 11 and 12, respectively can be moved vertically (shown by arrows A and B in FIG. 1) by the gap changing mechanism (not shown). As the gap changing mechanism, the mechanism disclosed in the above-described Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-206296 or In-vacuum undulators of SPring-8, T. Hara, T. Tanaka, T. Tanabe, X. M. Marechal, S. Okada and H. Kitamura: J. Synchrotron Radiation 5, 403 (1998) can be used, for example. The gap \u201cg\u201d of the space 13 can be changed by the gap changing mechanism. By changing the gap \u201cg\u201d, the intensity of the magnetic field in the space 13 can be adjusted as desired.",
                                "An upper part of the first support body 21 i-s supported by a first support shaft 14. The first support shaft 14 is formed of metal and its inside is hollow. Since almost an entire part of the first support shaft 14 is disposed outside the vacuum chamber 1, the heat of the room (outside the vacuum chamber) is transferred to the first support shaft 14 to raise a temperature of the first magnetic circuit 11. In order to prevent such temperature raise as much as possible, the first support shaft 14 is made hollow to prevent the temperature from being transferred. A lower part of the second support body 22 is also supported by a second support shaft 15 and its inside is hollow for the same reason as the above. Thus, while the support shafts 14 and 15 are kept strong, thermal conductivity thereof is lowered. A bellows 16 is provided around each of the support shafts 14 and 15, so that while the vacuum chamber 1 is held with vacuum, the support shafts 14 and 15 can be vertically moved.",
                                "Since the undulator is set in the room at the room temperature, it is necessary to avoid the radiation heat from infrared rays and the like as much as possible. Although the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 are vacuum-insulated by the vacuum chamber 1, the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 could not be sufficiently cooled due to the radiation heat. Thus, it is necessary to provide measures to reflect the heat. For example, it is preferable that surfaces of the magnet holders 21a and 22a and the magnet mounting beams 21b and 22b of the support bodies 21 and 22, are respectively plated with gold so that they can reflect the radiation heat.",
                                "A first heater 21c is provided on a back surface of the first magnet mounting beam 21b of the first support body 21. Similarly, a second heater 22c is provided in the second support body 22. In addition, temperature sensors 21d and 22d are buried in the first and second magnet mounting beams 21b and 22b, respectively (not shown in FIG. 1). FIG. 4 is a control block diagram showing a construction of a temperature control unit 23. Temperature data to control cooling of the permanent magnet is set in a temperature setting unit 24. The temperature control unit 23 compares temperature data measured by the temperature sensors 21d and 22d with the set temperature data and controls the heaters 21c and 22c separately so that the temperature may become a desired temperature.",
                                "As the heater, a sheath heater can be used, for example. The heaters 21c and 22c are mounted such that they are pressed onto the back sides of the magnet mounting beams 21b and 22b by a copper plate and the like and screwed, respectively. As the temperature sensor, a temperature measuring resistor or a thermocouple using platinum may be used.",
                                "Although the temperature control unit 23 is not always necessary, it is preferably provided in the following case. There is no problem in a case where as the characteristics of the permanent magnet, the magnetic characteristics is enhanced as the temperature of the permanent magnet is lowered, but there is a permanent magnet material which remanent flux density shows a peak value at a specific low temperature as shown in FIG. 5. For example, in a case where the permanent magnet is a rare earth- iron-boron magnet which causes spin reorientation at a temperature of TSR (spin reorientation temperature) or less, it is necessary to control the temperatures of the magnetic circuits 11 and 12 so that they may not be cooled to the TSR or less."

Referring to FIG. 14, permanent magnets designated by numbers 1 to 5 are formed of Nd\u2014Fe\u2014B and since they provide spin reorientation, their Br (remanent flux densities) are lowered at an extremely low temperature. A permanent magnet designated by number 6 is formed of Pr\u2014Fe\u2014B and it does not provide the spin reorientation. A hall element was used in measuring the magnetic field.

When the undulator is cooled by the cooling mechanism, the remanent flux density (Br) becomes high and the strong magnetic field can be formed in the space as compared with the case where the undulator is used at the room temperature. When the undulator is cooled, intrinsic magnetic coercive force (iHc) is increased, and radiation-proof characteristics can be enhanced accordingly. Since the magnetic circuit, the holder and holder support are cooled by the cooling mechanism, a baking process is not needed when ultrahigh vacuum is implemented. Thus, it is not necessary to consider heat demagnetization caused in the baking process and a permanent magnet having high energy product can be used.",

Since the high iHc material has a low Br unconditionally because of a complementary relation, the flux density formed in the magnetic circuit is low.",
                                "Meanwhile, according to the present invention, since a gas molecule is trapped on a magnet surface when the permanent magnet is cooled, the target vacuum degree can be provided without the degassing operation in the baking process. Namely, since the magnet is not heated, it is not necessary to select the high iHc material in order to prevent the heat demagnetization. Therefore, a high Br material can be selected and since the Br is raised at a low temperature, a higher magnetic flux density can be provided.",
