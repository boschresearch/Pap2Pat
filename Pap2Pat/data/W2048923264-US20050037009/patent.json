                        "Serine proteases are involved in many processes during tissue development and homeostasis. Among other functions they degrade components of the extracellular matrix to allow outgrowth of neuronal processes (Monard, D. (1988) Trends Neurosci. 11, 541-544) or cell migration (Seeds, N. W., Basham, M. E., and Haffke, S. P. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96, 4118-14123), they promote cell death (Tsirka, S. E., Rogove, A. D., Bugge, T. H., Degen, J. L., and Strickland, S. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17, 543-552) and act as mitogenic or survival factors (Vaughan, P. J., Pike, C. J., Cotman, C. W., and Cunningham, D. D. (1995) J. Neurosci. 15, 5389-5401). The activity of the proteases is regulated by their cognate inhibitors, which have to act in an accurately balanced fashion to ensure normal development and homeostasis. Disturbances of this balance in the nervous system have been proposed to be involved in pathological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (Turgeon, V. L. and Houenou, L. J. (1997) Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 25, 85-95; Wagner S L, Geddes J W, Cotman C W, Lau A L, Gurwitz D, Isackson P J, and Cunningham D D (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86 (21):8284-8).",
                        "To date, several serine proteases have been detected in the central nervous system, including tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), chymotrypsin, neuropsin, elastase, and thrombin (Davies, B. J., Pickard, B. S., Steel, M., Morris, R. G., and Lathe, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23004-23011). Many serine protease inhibitors regulating the activity of these proteases are found in the brain. However, the protease nexin-1 (PN-1; Gloor et al. (1986) Cell 47, 687-693; Stone, S. R., Nick, H., Hofsteenge, J., and Monard, D. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 252, 237-244) is the only known endogenous thrombin inhibitor present in the central nervous system. In vitro, the interplay of thrombin and PN-1 has been shown to modulate neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells (Monard, D., Niday, E., Limat, A., and Solomon, F. (1983) Prog. Brain. Res. 58, 359-364; Gurwitz, D. and Cunningham, D. D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3440-3444; Zum et al. (1988) Dev Neurosci 10, 17-24; Farmer et al. (1990) Dev. Neurosci. 12:73-80) and the stellation of astrocytes (Cavanaugh, K. P., Gurwitz, D., Cunningham, D. D., and Bradshaw, R. A. (1990) J. Neurochem. 54, 1735-1743). Furthermore, PN-1 is highly expressed in response to injury of the nervous system (Meier, R., Spreyer, P., Ortmann, R., Harel, A., and Monard, D. (1989) Nature 342, 548-550 25; Hoffmann et al. (1992) Neuroscience 49:397-408). Despite these observations mice lacking PN-1 show only subtle phenotypes in the nervous system (L\u00fcthi, A., Putten, H., Botteri, F. M., Mansuy, I. M., Meins, M., Frey, U., Sansig, G., Portet, C., Schmutz, M., Schroder, M., Nitsch, C., Laurent, J. P., and Monard, D. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17, 4688-4699), suggesting the existence of an entity that compensates for the lack of PN-1 function in these animals.",
                        "A 25 kDa carboxypeptidase Y inhibitor, termed Ic or the TFS1 gene product, has previously been described in yeast (Bruun, A. W., Svendsen, I., Sorensen, S. O., Kielland-Brandt, M. C., and Winther, J. R. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 3351-3357). Carboxypeptidase Y contains a catalytic Ser, His, Asp triad and a trypsin-like oxyanion hole. Its catalytic mechanism is therefore believed to be similar to the serine proteases of the trypsin-type (Mortensen, U. H., Olesen, K., and Breddam, K. (1998) in Handbook of proteolytic enzymes (Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F., eds) pp. 389-393, Academic Press, London). The similarity in sequence between TFS1 (Ic) and 21-23 kDa lipid binding proteins, such as phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP), led the authors to speculate that the 21-23 kDa lipid binding proteins may also be inhibitors of specific cellular serine carboxypeptidases. The mouse phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, PEBP, is made up of 187 amino acids and belongs to a family of phospholipid binding proteins found in a wide range of species from flowering plants to mammals (Schoentgen, F. and Jolles, P. (1995) FEBS Lett. 369, 22-26). TFS1 and mouse PEBP share 31% identity at the amino acid level.",
                        "The phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein was originally purified from bovine brain and described as a soluble 23 kDa basic cytosolic protein (Bernier, I. and Jolles, P. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 790, 174-181). Binding studies revealed its affinity for phosphatidylethanolamine (Bernier, I., Tresca, J. P., and Jolles, P. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 871, 19-23), nucleotides like GTP and GDP and small GTP-binding proteins and other hydrophobic ligands (Bucquoy, S., Jolles, P., and Schoentgen, F. (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 225, 1203-1210). Independently, PEBP was purified from human brain as neuropolypeptide h3 (Bollengier, F. and Mahler, A. (1980) Neuropeptides 1, 119-135 26): sequencing of this protein (Seddiqi, N., Bollengier, F., Alliel, P. M., Perin, J. P., Bonnet, F., Bucquoy, S., Jolles, P., and Schoentgen, F. (1994) J. Mol. Evol. 39, 655-660) showed 95% amino acid sequence identity with the sequence for the bovine PEBP (Schoentgen, F., Saccoccio, F., Jolles, J., Bernier, I., and Jolles, P. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 166, 333-338). Today members of this family have been identified in other mammals including rat (Grandy, D. K., Hanneman, E., Bunzow, J., Shih, M., Machida, C. A., Bidlack, J. M., and Civelli, O. (1990) Mol. Endocrinol. 4, 1370-1376), mouse (Araki, Y., Vierula, M. E., Rankin, T. L., Tulsiani, D. R., and Orgebin-Crist, M. C. (1992) Biol. Reprod. 47, 832-843) and monkey (Perry, A. C., Hall, L., Bell, A. E., and Jones, R. (1994) Biochem. J. 301 (Pt 1), 235-242). Other members of the PEBP family are the putative odorant-binding protein in Drosphila (Pikielny, C. W., Hasan, G., Rouyer, F., and Rosbash, M. (1994) Neuron 12, 35-49), the putative PEBP of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Trottein, F. and Cowman, A. F. (1995) Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 70, 235-239), the Ov-16 antigen of Onchocera volvulus (Lobos, E., Altmann, M., Mengod, G., Weiss, N., Rudin, W., and Karam, M. (1990) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 39, 135-145) and the toxocara excretory-secretory antigen 26 of Toxocara canis (Gems, D., Ferguson, C. J., Robertson, B. D., Nieves, R., Page, A. P., Blaxter, M. L., and Maizels, R. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18517-18522), two parasitic nematodes. A dosage-dependent suppressor of CDC25 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, twenty five suppressor 1 (TFS1, Robinson, L. C. and Tatchell, K. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 230, 241-250), and several proteins in flowering plants (Arabidopsis thaliana (Ohshima, S., Murata, M., Sakamoto, W., Ogura, Y., and Motoyoshi, F. (1997) Mol. Gen. Genet. 254, 186-194 27; Kardailsky, I., Shukla, V. K., Ahn, J. H., Dagenais, N., Christensen, S. K., Nguyen, J. T., Chory, J., Harrison, M. J., and Weigel, D. (1999) Science 286, 1962-1965; Kobayashi, Y., Kaya, H., Goto, K., Iwabuchi, M., and Araki, T. (1999) Science 286, 1960-1962) and Antirrhinum (Bradley, D., Carpenter, R., Copsey, L., Vincent, C., Rothstein, S., and Coen, E. (1996) Nature 379, 791-797)) are also included in this family.",
                        "Despite this widespread expression and the resolution of the 3D structures of bovine and human PEBP by X-ray crystallography (Serre, L., Vallee, B., Bureaud, N., Schoentgen, F., and Zelwer, C. (1998) Structure 6, 1255-1265; Banfield, M. J., Barker, J. J., Perry, A. C., and Brady, R. L. (1998) Structure 6, 1245-1254) very little is known about the function or properties of the proteins in this family. In rat hippocampus, PEBP was described to be the precursor of the hippocampal neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), an undecapeptide that is involved in the differentiation of neurons in the medial septal nucleus by enhancing the synthesis of choline acetyltransferase (Ojika, K., Mitake, S., Tohdoh, N., Appel, S. H., Otsuka, Y., Katada, E., and Matsukawa, N. (2000) Prog. NeurobioL 60, 37-83). However, the widespread expression of PEBP outside of the central nervous system including spleen, testis, ovary, muscle and stomach (Bollengier, F. and Mahler, A. (1988) J. Neurochem. 50, 1210-1214; Frayne, J., Ingram, C., Love, S., and Hall, L. (1999) Cell. Tissue Res. 298, 415-423) suggests additional roles for this protein.",
                        "The members of the PEBP family are often highly expressed in growing or elongated cells such as oligodendrocytes, spermatides, and the inflorescence meristem of flowering plants. Together, this expression pattern and the binding to phospholipids located mainly on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane suggests a role for PEBP in the organization of the plasma membrane during cell growth and development. PEBP was reported to be one of several cellular proteins present inside the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions (Ott, D. E., Coren, L. V., Johnson, D. G., Kane, B. P., Sowder, R. C., Kim, Y. D., Fisher, R. J., Zhou, X. Z., Lu, K. P., and Henderson, L. E. (2000) Virology 266, 42-51), supporting a possible role for PEBP in membrane organization.",
                        "On the other hand, the interaction between PEBP and small-GTP binding proteins leads to speculation that PEBP could be involved in the signaling machinery. Recently, PEBP was described as a Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) that suppresses the MAP-kinase signaling (Yeung, K., Seitz, T., Li, S., Janosch, P., McFerran, B., Kaiser, C., Fee, F., Katsanakis, K. D., Rose, D. W., Mischak, H., Sedivy, J. M., and Kolch, W. (1999) Nature 401, 173-177; Yeung, K., Janosch, P., McFerr n, B., Rose, D. W., Mischak, H., Sedivy, J. M., and Kolch, W. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20, 3079-3085). The authors of this study suggest that PEBP regulates the ERK pathway at the Raf/MEK interface by binding to Raf-1 and MEK thereby leading to a competitive inhibition of the ERK pathway. They further showed that the binding of PEBP/RKIP to Raf-1 decreases during mitogenic stimulation.",
                        "In summary, although possible PEBP functions have been suggested in the art, there has been no definitive demonstration of PEBP protease inhibitory activity. PEBP shares no significant homology with other known classes of serine protease inhibitors such as the serpins, the Kunitz, the Kazal, or the Bowman-Birk family (Barrett, A. J. and Salvesen, G. (1986) Proteinase inhibitors, Elsevier, Amsterdam 28)."

                        "The present invention also provides a screening method for identifying compounds capable of enhancing or inhibiting a biological activity of a PEBP family member, which involves contacting a protease which is inhibited by a PEBP family member with a candidate compound in the presence of a partially inhibitory amount of a PEBP family member, assaying proteolytic activity of the protease on a susceptible substrate in the presence of the candidate compound and partially inhibitory amount of the PEBP family member, and comparing the proteolytic activity to a standard level of activity, the standard being assayed when contact is made between the protease and its substrate in the presence of the partially inhibitory amount of a PEBP family member and the absence of the candidate compound. In this assay, an increase in inhibition of proteolytic activity over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of PEBP inhibitory activity and a decrease in inhibition of proteolytic activity compared to the standard indicates that the compound is an antagonist of PEBP inhibitory activity.",

                        "The present inventors have identified a protease inhibitor that is able to compensate for the lack of the thrombin inhibitor, PN-1, in PN-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. The protease inhibitor has been identified as a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) family and has been characterized as having specific serine protease inhibitory activity, in particular thrombin, neuropsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities. Thus, in one aspect of the invention, a method is provided of inhibiting a protease, preferably a serine protease, more preferably a serine protease selected from the group consisting of thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin, the method comprising contacting the protease with an effective amount of a phosphoethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) family member.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cPEBP family member\u201d is meant to encompass PEBP homolgues or fragments, which can be identified as such by comprising regions of at least 50% identity, preferably at least 70% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, most preferably at least 90% identity to the regions spanning amino acid residues 65-86 and 115-128 of human PEBP as disclosed by Bruun et al. (see FIG. 1C, 3rd sequence therein; SEQ ID NO:2). Other than related mammalian PEBP proteins, other members of the PEBP family are the putative odorant-binding protein in Drosphila (Pikielny, C. W., Hasan, G., Rouyer, F., and Rosbash, M. (1994) Neuron 12, 35-49), the putative PEBP of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Trottein, F. and Cowman, A. F. (1995) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 70, 235-239), the Ov-16 antigen of Onchocera volvulus (Lobos, E., Altmann, M., Mengod, G., Weiss, N., Rudin, W., and Karam, M. (1990) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 39, 135-145) and the toxocara excretory-secretory antigen 26 of Toxocara canis (Gems, D., Ferguson, C. J., Robertson, B. D., Nieves, R., Page, A. P., Blaxter, M. L., and Maizels, R. M.

                        "Preferred members are mammalian PEBPs or synthetic PEBPs derived from the mammalian sequences, which include amino acid substitutions, deletions and additions compared to naturally occurring PEBPs. Naturally occurring PEBPs also include \u201callelic variants\u201d that are alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985). Most preferred are human PEBP (SEQ ID NO:2) or PEBP encoded by the sequence provided in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:1). Thus, in one aspect of the invention, a PEBP polypeptide encoded by the sequence provided in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:1) is provided.",
                        "Although the specific examples provided herein are limited to known members of the PEBP family, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that PEBP family members yet to be identified, or fragments thereof, are easily prepared in light of the teachings of the present specification. For example, oligonucleotide templates for the PCR-amplification of the coding sequences of the different PEBP polypeptides can be modified for use according to the extent of homology between the known and new PEBP family members and depending on hybridization conditions. Alternatively, if sufficient identity exists between the two sequences, the same template can be used without further modification. Alternatively, suitable pairs of oligonucleotide templates can be used. In addition, variants of the naturally occurring sequence is foreseen, in particular conservative substitutions of amino acids not essential for protease inhibitory activity.",
                        "The PEBP family member can be prepared as a fusion protein to facilitate purification or certain assay formats. The fusion protein may comprise, in addition to PEBP family member sequences, tags or a reporter molecule, for example. The tag can be, for example, hemagglutinin (HA), repetitive histidine residues (His6) or the like. The reporter molecule (i.e., a signal generating molecule) can be any molecule capable of providing a detectable change. Such reporter molecules include fluorescent moieties (e.g., fluorescent proteins or chemical fluorescent labels), radioactive moieties, phosphorescent moieties, antigens, reporter enzymes and the like. Preferably, the reporter molecule is a reporter enzyme whose activity brings about a detectable change. Such reporter enzymes include, but are not limited to, the following: beta-galactosidase, glucosidases, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), glucoronidases, luciferase, peroxidases, phosphatases, oxidoreductases, dehydrogenases, transferases, isomerases, kinases, reductases, deaminases, catalases and urease. The selection of an appropriate reporter molecule will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.",
                        "The PEBP family member or fusion protein can be easily prepared by recombinant or chemical methods, as well as by using standard protein purification techniques, as is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the DNA coding for the PEBP family member or fusion protein may be comprised in a nucleic acid expression cassette comprising a promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the PEBP family member or fusion protein and optionally to transcription termination signals. The fused polypeptides of the fusion protein may be connected directly or by a spacer",
                        "Proteins may also be obtained by synthetic means rather than derived from natural sources, using commercially available protein synthesisers or even ordered from a commercial peptide synthesis service. Synthesized proteins may comprise any desired sequence modifications, including the use of altered amino acid residues or the addition of heterologous groups or side-chains to the polypeptide, and incorporation of labels or tags. Chemically synthesized proteins may also include non-peptidyl linkages as is apparent to those skilled in the art.",
                        "The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d as used herein with respect to protease inhibition means sufficient to inhibit the susceptible protease by at least 20%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50% or more.",
                        "The protease inhibitory activities of PEBP family members are useful for protein purification, in particular proteinase purification (e.g., thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin), as well as for other production and research applications. Thus, PEBP family members may be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material, an acceptable composition comprising a PEBP polypeptide, which is effective for the desired purpose, and a label that indicates that the composition is used as a protease inhibitor, in particular an inhibitor of thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin.",
                        "In one aspect of the invention, screening methods are provided where a protease susceptible to inhibition by a PEBP family member is contacted with a PEBP family member and an additional potential protease modulator. A change in the level of protease activity detected in the presence of the potential protease modulator as compared to when said potential protease modulator is absent indicates the presence of a protease modulator. The term \u201cprotease susceptible to inhibition by a PEBP family member\u201d as used herein is meant to encompass any protease inhibited by a PEBP family member, preferably by a mammalian PEBP. Most preferably, the protease is thrombin, chymotrypsin or neuropsin.",
                        "In particular, a method is provided for identifying modulators of a biological activity of a PEBP family member, the method comprising contacting a protease susceptible to inhibition by a PEBP family member with a candidate compound in the presence of a partially inhibitory amount of said PEBP family member, assaying proteolytic activity of said protease in the presence of a susceptible substrate, said candidate compound and partially inhibitory amount of said PEBP family member, and comparing the proteolytic activity to a standard level of activity, the standard level of activity being assayed when contact is made between the protease and said substrate in the presence of the partially inhibitory amount of PEBP family member and the absence of said candidate compound. An increase in inhibition of proteolytic activity over the standard is correlated with the presence of an agonist of PEBP inhibitory activity, whereas a decrease in inhibition of proteolytic activity compared to the standard is correlated with the presence of an antagonist of PEBP inhibitory activity. Therefore, an agonist in the present context is a compound which increases the natural biological functions of a PEBP family member or which functions in a manner similar to a PEBP family member, while antagonists decrease or eliminate such functions.",
                        "The invention also provides a method of screening compounds to identify those that enhance or block the action of PEBP family members on proteases, based on their ability to interact with proteases, in particular with thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin. Thus, a method is provided for identifying modulators of a biological activity of a PEBP family member by contacting a PEBP-susceptible protease, preferably thrombin, chymotrypsin or neuropsin, with a PEBP polypeptide and a candidate compound, and determining whether binding of the PEBP family member to said PEBP-susceptible protease is increased or decreased due to the presence of the candidate compound.",
                        "For example, a cellular extract or fraction may be prepared from a cell that expresses or comprises a molecule that binds a PEBP family member, such as a molecule of a signaling or regulatory pathway or phosphatidylethanolamine, or a body fluid can be used in the screening assays described herein. The preparation can be incubated with a labeled PEBP family member in the absence or the presence of a candidate molecule that may be a PEBP agonist or antagonist. The ability of the candidate molecule to bind the binding molecule is reflected in decreased binding of the labeled ligand. Molecules that bind gratuitously, i.e., without inducing the effects of PEBP on binding the PEBP-binding molecule, are most likely to be good antagonists. Molecules that bind well and elicit effects that are the same as or closely related to PEBP are agonists.",
                        "Another example of an assay for PEBP antagonists is a competitive assay that combines a PEBP family member and a potential antagonist of a PEBP-susceptible protease, particularly thrombin, chymotrypsin or neuropsin under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The PEBP family member can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of PEBP family member molecules bound to protease molecules can be determined accurately to assess the effectiveness of the potential antagonist.",
                        "Potential antagonists include small organic molecules, peptides, polypeptides and antibodies that bind to a PEBP family member and thereby inhibit or eliminate its activity. Potential antagonists also may be small organic molecules, a peptide, a polypeptide such as a closely related protein or antibody that binds the same sites on a binding molecule, such as PEBP-susceptible protease molecule, without inducing PEBP-induced activities, thereby preventing the action of PEBP by excluding PEBP from binding.",
                        "Once the potential agonist/antagonist is identified, further analysis can be carried out to confirm the identification. Such tests are known in the art and include neurite outgrowth assays, phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays, Ca2+ efflux assays, and platelet aggregation assays.",
                        "Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA, or RNA or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed, for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56: 560 (1991); \u201cOligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6: 3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241: 456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251: 136((1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example, the 5\u2032 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature PEBP family member may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of PEBP. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into PEBP polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of PEBP.",
                        "The agonists and antagonists may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., as described below.",
                        "Serine proteases play a role in the pathology of a variety of disorders, including cerebral ischaemia, neurodegenerative disorders, cataract, myocardial ischaemia, muscular dystrophy and platelet aggregation. Thus, compounds that have activity as serine protease inhibitors are considered by those of skill in this art to be useful. For example, thrombin is a key protease in thrombogenesis. Intravascular clotting occurs frequently with shock, sepsis, cancer, obstetric complications, bums, and liver disease. Thus a thrombin inhibitor is particularly useful in inhibiting blood coagulation or preventing embolies.",
                        "In one aspect of the invention, therefore, a method is provided for inhibiting or delaying blood clotting comprising contacting blood with a PEBP family member or agonist, preferably a mammalian or human PEBP, in an amount sufficient to inhibit blood coagulation.",
                        "Blood generally clots in vitro in four to eight minutes when placed in a glass tube. Clotting is prevented if a chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citrate is added to bind Ca2+. The ability of a PEBP family member to delay blood clotting can be shown by addition of approprate amounts of the PEBP family member to blood to inhibit blood coagulation completely or delay blood coagulation beyond 8 minutes, as desired. The required amounts can be determined empirically.",
                        "Thrombotic disorders, including acute vascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and other blood system thromboses, constitute major health risks. Such disorders are caused by either partial or total occlusion of a blood vessel by a blood clot, which consists of fibrin and platelet aggregates. Therapeutic intervention with agents that prevent or delay clot formation (i.e., anticoagulants) or with agents that dissolve blood clots (i.e., thrombolytics) is common practice. The unexpected anti-thrombin properties of PEBP family members can now be applied in treating such thrombotic disorders. The administered PEBP family member present in the blood during clot formation delays clotting time and/or may change the character of the clot that is formed to a looser, less stable clot.",
                        "The term \u201cthrombotic disorder\u201d as used herein encompasses conditions associated with or resulting from thrombosis or a tendency towards thrombosis. These conditions include conditions associated with arterial thrombosis, such as coronary artery thrombosis and resulting myocardial infarction, cerebral artery thrombosis or intracardiac thrombosis (due to, e.g., atrial fibrillation) and resulting stroke, and other peripheral arterial thrombosis and occlusion; conditions associated with venous thrombosis, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; conditions associated with exposure of the patient's blood to a foreign or injured tissue surface, including diseased heart valves, mechanical heart valves, vascular grafts, and other extracorporeal devices such as intravascular cannulas, vascular access shunts in hemodialysis patients, hemodialysis machines and cardiopulmonary bypass machines; and conditions associated with coagulapathies, such as hypercoagulability and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy that are not the result of an endotoxin-initiated coagulation cascade.",
                        "The PEBP family member can be administered together with conventional antithrombotic agents, such as antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant agents (heparin), vitamin K antagonists (coumarin derivatives, warfarin) and thrombolytic agents, in dosages and by routes consistent with the usual clinical practice. [See, generally, Goodman & Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed., McGraw-Hill, N.Y. (1996).]",
                        "Anti-thrombotic agents are also used routinely to prevent the occlusion of extracorporeal devices: intravascular cannulas, vascular access shunts in hemodialysis patients, hemodialysis machines, and cardiopulmonary bypass machines. Thus, in a further aspect of the invention, a PEBP family member is coated onto a solid surface, including without limitation those listed above, prior to contacting the surface with blood.",
                        "Serine proteases are known to have an effect on many other disorders and therefore, PEBP family members are useful in treating an individual in need of an increased level of PEBP activity (or of decreased proteolytic activity of a PEBP-susceptible protease, particularly thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin) comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of a PEBP family member, particularly a mature form of the PEBP family member, effective to increase the PEBP activity level (and, thereby decrease the PEBP-susceptible protease activity) in such an individual. Such an individual may be suffering from a particular disorder or disease or merely at high risk of obtaining the disorder or disease.",
                        "The disorders or diseases include, but are not limited to: Alzheimer's disease, cognition deficits, Down's Syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, dementia pugilistica, head trauma and conditions characterized by a degradation of the neuronal cytoskeleton resulting from a thrombolytic or hemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary emphysema, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, periodontal disease, cystic fibrosis, respiratory disease, thrombosis, cancer, cachexia, angina, glaucoma, inflamatory disorders, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, atherosclerotic disorders such as cardiac infarction, and stroke, asthma, psoriasis, demyelinating diseases, AIDS immune deficiency, disorders of photoreceptor degeneration, and lens cataract formation, organ transplant rejection, restenosis, muscular dystrophy, renal failure, cerebral vasospasm, pancreatitis, disorders of mitogen induced cell growth and diabetic nephropathy.",
                        "As used herein, an effective amount of a compound for treating a disorder is an amount that is sufficient to ameliorate, or in some manner reduce a symptom or stop or reverse progression of a condition. Such amount may be administered as a single dosage or may be administered according to a regimen, whereby it is effective. \u201cTreatment\u201d as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particular a human, and includes: \n\n\n- (a) preventing the disease/condition or symptom from occurring in a\n  subject which may be predisposed to the disease/condition or symptom\n  but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;\n- (b) inhibiting the disease/condition or symptom, i.e., arresting its\n  development; or\n- (c) relieving the disease/condition symptom, i.e., causing regression\n  of the disease/condition.",
                        "A PEBP family member has now been shown to exhibit selective inhibition of thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin. In addition, in vitro enzymatic activity has been demonstrated for recombinantly-expressed purified protein. See Examples 4 and 5. As noted above, PEBP compensates for the lack of PN-1 in PN-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Protease nexin I (PN-1 or glia-derived nexin, GDN) has been shown to inhibit thrombin specifically and to promote, in vitro, neurite extension in neuroblastoma cell lines as well as primary hippocampal, and sympathetic neurons. The PN-1 gene is induced transcriptionally and protein levels are increased following rat sciatic nerve axotomy. Treatment of chick developing motoneurons, i.e. E6-E9 lumbrosacral motoneurons that normally undergo apoptosis, with PN-1 results in increased survival of motoneurons. Motoneuron death experimentally induced by sciatic nerve lesioning in mouse is also decreased by PN-1 addition. Alzheimer-diseased brain regions contain higher PN-1/thrombin complexes compared with free PNI than do normal brains suggesting that PN-1 may have a role in CNS pathology. Chymotrypsin has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease, and the localization of neuropsin to brain tissue also suggests a neurological function of these proteins.",
                        "Thus, due to the functional similarities and tissue localization between PEBP and PN-1, PEBP family members can be used for treating neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis. Motoneuron or sensory neuron damage resulting from spinal cord injury also my be prevented by treatment with a PEBP family member. In addition, central nervous system diseases like Alzheimer's disease may be treated with a PEBP family member or, a small molecule agonist capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, which agonist can be identified according to the methods of the present invention. For some treatments, it is advantageous to have the PEBP family member or agonist cross the blood-brain barrier. PEBP's ability to bind phosphatidylethanolamine facilitates liposome delivery across the blood-brain barrier.",
                        "Aside from the nervous system-related disorders described above, PN-1 has been shown to inhibit breakdown of extracellular matrix in a fibroblast tumor cell line. Such breakdown is thought to enable tumor cells to metastasize by weakening of extracellular matrix which normally prevents penetration of unrelated cells through a tissue. Thus, a PEBP family member may also be used to inhibit extracellular matrix destruction, in particular that associated with tumors secreting a PEBP-susceptible protease, for instance, neural tissue tumors secreting thrombin, chymotrypsin or neuropsin.",
                        "The composition comprising the PEBP family member will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with PEBP family member alone), the site of delivery of the composition, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The \u201ceffective amount\u201d of PEBP family member for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.",
                        "As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of a PEBP family member administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 \u03bcg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably, this dose is at least 0.01 mg/kg/day, and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg/kg/day. If given continuously, the PEBP family member is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 \u03bcg/kg/hour to about 50 \u03bcg/kg/hour, either by 1-4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions, for example, using a mini-pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect.",
                        "Pharmaceutical compositions containing the PEBP family member may be administered peridurally, orally, rectally, parenterally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d is meant a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term \u201cparenteral\u201d as used herein refers to modes of administration that include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.",
                        "The PEBP family member is also suitably administered by sustained-release systems. Suitable examples of sustained-release compositions include semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or mirocapsules. Liposomes comprising the PEBP family member are prepared by methods known in the art: DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 82:3688-3692 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal PEBP therapy.",
                        "Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the PEBP family member (and, optionally, any cofactor which may enhance its activity) uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes.",
                        "The PEBP family member is typically formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, preferably 1-10 mg/ml, at a pH of about 3 to 8. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of salts.",

Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. Such kits can optionally comprise equipment useful in administering the composition such as an inhaler, syringes and the like.",
                        "In addition, the PEBP family members may be employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds. Agonists of PEBP may be employed in place of or in addition to a PEBP family member, for instance, for treating any of the disordersor diseases referred to above.",
                        "Similarly, antagonists of PEBP family members, such as anti-PEBP antibodies, may be used in a method for treating an individual in need of a decreased level of PEBP activity in the body (i.e., less inhibition of a protease susceptible to PEBP) comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a PEBP antagonist. As noted above, elimination of PN-1 (described above) by homologous recombination leads to reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) of learning, whereas overexpression of PN-1 results in enhanced LTP of hippocampal neurons. Id. Similarly, antagonists PEBP activity capable of passing the blood-brain barrier can be used to enhance LTP of hippocampal neurons in nervous system conditions characterized by excessive PEBP expression.",
                        "As stated above, the present inventors have discovered that PEBP is able to compensate for PN-1 activity in brain, and further that PEBP inhibits serine proteases, such as thrombin, chymotrypsin and neuropsin. For a number of disorders, in particular of the central or peripheral nervous system and thrombogenesis, significantly higher or lower levels of PEBP protease inhibitory activity may be detected in certain tissues (e.g., central and peripheral nervous system tissue and testis) or bodily fluids (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine, seminal fluid, synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid) taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to a \u201cstandard\u201d PEBP protease inhibitory activity, i.e., the PEBP protease inhibitory activity level in healthy tissue from an individual not having the nervous system disorder. Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of nervous system disorders, which involves: (a) assaying the PEBP protease inhibitory activity level in cells or body fluid of an individual; (b) comparing the PEBP protease inhibitory activity level with a standard PEBP protease inhibitory level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed PEBP protease inhibitory level compared to the standard level (that from a non-afflicted individual) is indicative of a disorder in that individual.",
                        "By individual is intended mammalian individuals, preferably humans, including adults, children, babies and embryos or fetuses. By \u201cmeasuring the level of PEBP\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the PEBP activity, PEBP protein amount, or PEBP mRNA in a sample directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the PEBP protein level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the PEBP level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard PEBP level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a disorder. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.",
                        "By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual, body fluid, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which contains PEBP protein or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as sera, plasma, seminal fluid, urine, synovial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid), nervous system tissue, and other tissue sources found to express PEBP. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.",
                        "Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi, Anal. Biochem. 162:156-159 (1987). Levels of PEBP mRNA are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction (RT-LCR).",
                        "Assaying PEBP protein levels in a biological sample can occur using any art-known method. Preferred for assaying PEBP levels in a biological sample are antibody-based techniques or activity-based techniques. For example, PEBP expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. In these, the specific recognition is provided by the primary antibody (polyclonal or monoclonal) but the secondary detection system can utilize fluorescent, enzyme, or other conjugated secondary antibodies. As a result, an. immunohistological staining of tissue section for pathological examination is obtained. Tissues can also be extracted, e.g., with urea and neutral detergent, for the liberation of PEBP protein for Western-blot or dot/slot assay, ELISA or RIA assays (Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987)). In this technique, which is based on the use of cationic solid phases, quantitation of PEBP protein can be accomplished using isolated PEBP protein as a standard. This technique can advantageously be applied to body fluids. PEBP-protein specific antibodies for use in the present invention can be prepared using routine procedures.",

One half of the sample was incubated with 60 \u03bcl human \u03b1-thrombin (1 nM) in enzyme buffer (67 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 133 mM NaCl, 0.13% PEG-6000), the other half with 60 \u03bcl enzyme buffer alone (negative control), for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. After preincubation, an immunoprecipitation was performed with protein A-Sepharose beads coated with the anti-thrombin monoclonal antibody EST-6. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham-Pharmacia) were coated with monoclonal antibodies against thrombin, EST-6 (American Diagnostics), as described elsewhere (Harlow, E. and Lane, D. (1988) in Antibodies (Harlow, E. and Lane, D., eds) pp. 522-523, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). EST-6 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes free thrombin as well as thrombin complexed with inhibitors (e.g. antithrombin-III) (Dawes, J., James, K., Micklem, L. R., Pepper, D. S., and Prowse, C. V. (1984) Thromb. Res. 36, 397-409). Fifty (50) \u03bcl of the EST-6 coated beads were added to the samples and the mixtures incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight with gentle shaking. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml enzyme buffer each, and then the co-immunoprecipitated proteins recovered by resuspending the beads in 50 \u03bcl sample buffer. After denaturation at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min, the bead supernatants were resolved by 12.5%-SDS-PAGE. The gel was then silver stained following the manufacture's protocol (BioRad Silver Stain) to visualize the proteins.",
                                "As the binding properties between thrombin and the putative inhibitor were not known initially, the co-immunoprecipitation was performed under very low stringency conditions resulting in a high background. Nevertheless a protein of approximately 20 kDa could be identified as being co-immunoprecipitated after preincubation with human \u03b1-thrombin but not with buffer.",
                                "In summary, these data suggested the existence of a thrombin binding protein of 20-23 kDa as a potential candidate thrombin inhibitor."

Brain homogenates (whole) from PN-1(\u2212/\u2212) of different ages (14 days; 6 months; 1 year; 2 years) or wild-type mice were prepared essentially as described in Example 1.

The amount of the 21-24 kDa inhibitory activity is approximately the same in brain homogenates prepared from mice of different ages (from 14 days to two years) as well as between wild type and PN-1(\u2212/\u2212) mice. A peak in hydrolysis rates was seen in fractions 64-66 of fractionated brain tissue from older animals, probably corresponding to a proteinase having a molecular weight of substantially less than 20 kDa, which is upregulated with age.",

In previous experiments, the inhibitor was found not to bind to Q-Sepharose or heparin-Sepharose at pH 9.0 or to SP-Sepharose at pH 5.0. Because of the need to monitor activity in the flow-through or the eluate of these columns, it was not appropriate to perform the chromatography steps at higher or lower pH values. Therefore, a combined anion exchange and heparin affinity chromatography followed by a cation exchange chromatography was used to allow recovery of the inhibitor from the flow-through of the columns. The heparin column was included because of its ability to bind PN-1 whose thrombin inhibitory activity is well established (Van Nostrand, W. E., Wagner, S. L., and Cunningham, D. D.

Sequencing of the 1921274 clone showed that the 3\u2032-end of this cDNA is altered compared to the published sequences for the mouse PEBP-mRNA (GenBank accession number U43206) resulting in a replacement of the last ten amino acid of the PEBP.

The recombinant 6\u00d7His-PEBP protein was purified using the Ni-NTA Spin Kit (Qiagen) under native conditions following the manufacture's protocol with enzyme buffer containing 20 mM imidazole as washing buffer and enzyme buffer containing 250 mM imidazole as elution buffer. The eluate was desalted over a NAP-5 column to remove the imidazole resulting in a total volume of 1 ml. Cell lysate of \u201cempty\u201d vector transfected cells was treated in the same way and served as control. Alternatively, 20 mM sodium phosphate pH6.8, 320 mM sucrose, 0.2% TWEEN-20 and 1 mM EDTA can be used as enzyme buffer.",
                                "Six different serine proteases were diluted in enzyme buffer (67 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 133 mM NaCl, 0.13% PEG-6000) and used in protease activity assays with the following final amounts: thrombin, trypsin and chymotrypsin, 0.005 pmol; t-PA and neuropsin, 0.5 pmol; and pancreatic elastase, 4 pmol. Human \u03b1-thrombin was prepared and according to Stone et al. (Stone, S. R. and Hofsteenge, J. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4622-4628); all other proteases are commercially available (e.g., Sigma, Fluka). Each diluted protease (10 \u03bcl) was preincubated with 80 \u03bcl of a 6\u00d7His-PEBP preparation that had been shown to inhibit the amidolytic activity of 0.005 pmol thrombin to approx. 55%. The pre-incubation was carried out in a 96-well plate for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. After addition of 10 \u03bcl chromogenic protease substrate (H-D-lle-Pro-Arg-para-nitroanilide, Chromogenix, 1.25 mg/ml in H2O for all proteases other than chymotrypsin; or N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide, Sigma, 2.3 mg/ml in H2O for chymotrypsin), any remaining amidolytic activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate at 405 nm over 30 min using a THERMOmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The 6\u00d7His-PEBP sample caused a 25% inhibition of 0.005 pmol chymotrypsin and a 70% inhibition of 0.5 pmol neuropsin. The amidolytic activities of trypsin (0.005 pmol), tissue plasminogen activator (0.5 pmol), and pancreatic elastase (4 pmol) were not affected.",
                                "To determine the inhibition constants, the rates for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrates were measured as described above at fixed enzyme concentrations and substrate concentrations ranging from 3.5 \u03bcM to 216 \u03bcM and PEBP-H6 concentrations between 0 and 2.9 \u03bcM. The measured values were fitted with the software GraFit 4.0 (Erithacus Software) to the equation for a competitive inhibitor. Thrombin and chymotrypsin are competitively inhibited by PEBP-H6 with apparent Ki of 3.8+/\u22121.3\u00d710\u22127 and 1.8+/\u22121.0\u00d710\u22126, respectively.",
                                "An interference of the C-terminal histidine tag could be excluded by the use of purified N-terminal His-tagged PEBP, partially purified PEBP with an N- or C-terminal hemagglutinin tag, as well as the protein encoded by the IMAGE clone No. 1921274 with 10 different amino acids at the C-terminal. All these different proteins showed similar inhibitory properties.",
                                "In summary, a serine protease inhibitor from brain tissue, PEBP, is demonstrated to inhibit the amidolytic activities of thrombin, neuropsin, and chymotrypsin, but not trypsin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), or pancreatic elastase. Data supporting PEBP's inability to inhibit the serine proteases kallikrein and activated protein C were also obtained using partially purified PEBP fractions."
