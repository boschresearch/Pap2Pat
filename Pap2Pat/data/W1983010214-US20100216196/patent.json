                        "The present invention relates to a method for producing L-cysteine or related substances. Specifically, the present invention relates to a bacterium suitable for the production of L-cysteine or related substances and a method for producing L-cysteine or related substances utilizing such a bacterium. L-cysteine and L-cysteine related substances are useful in the fields of drugs, cosmetics, and foods.",
                        "2. Brief Description of the Related Art",
                        "L-cysteine is conventionally obtained by extraction from keratin-containing substances such as hair, horns, and feathers, or by the conversion of DL-2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid using a microbial enzyme. L-cysteine has also been produced on a large scale by using an immobilized enzyme method and a novel enzyme. Furthermore, it has also been attempted to produce L-cysteine by fermentation utilizing a microorganism.",
                        "Microorganisms which are able to produce L-cysteine are known. For example, a coryneform bacterium with increased intracellular serine acetyltransferase activity produces cysteine (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 2002-233384). The ability to produce L-cysteine can also be increased by incorporating serine acetyltransferase which has been mutated to attenuate feedback inhibition by L-cysteine (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-155571, U.S. Patent Published Application No. 20050112731, U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,168).",
                        "Furthermore, the ability to produce L-cysteine in a microorganism can be enhanced by suppressing the L-cysteine decomposition system. Examples of such microorganisms include coryneform bacteria or Escherichia bacteria in which the activity of cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-155571), tryptophanase (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-169668), or O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-245311) is attenuated or deleted.",
                        "Furthermore, it is known that the ydeD gene which encodes the YdeD protein participates in secretion of the metabolic products of the cysteine pathway (Dabler et al., Mol. Microbiol., 36, 1101-1112 (2000)). Furthermore, techniques for enhancing the ability to produce L-cysteine by increasing expression of the mar-locus, emr-locus, acr-locus, cmr-locus, mex-gene, bmr-gene or qacA-gene are also known. These loci and/or genes encode proteins which cause secretion of toxic substances from cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,663). emrAB, emrKY, yojIH, acrEF, bcr, and cusA are further examples (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-287333).",
                        "An Escherichia coli has been reported which produces L-cysteine, and which has increased activity of the positive transcriptional control factor of the cysteine regulon encoded by the cysB gene (International Patent Publication WO01/27307).",
                        "It is known that dsbA (Shevchik V. E., et al., EMBO J., 1994 Apr. 15; 13(8):2007-12) participates in the formation of disulfide bonds (S\u2014S) of proteins as described below, but the relation thereof with L-cysteine production is not known.",
                        "In general, many proteins with a disulfide bond (S\u2014S) are among proteins that are secreted into cell membrane surface layers or out of cells. The interior of cells enclosed by the cell membranes is under relatively mild conditions both physically and chemically. However, since the exterior of cells is a more severe environment, the structures of proteins need to be more rigid. The presence of S\u2014S bonds in proteins is one of the strategies.",
                        "Anfinsen et al. demonstrated that oxidative folding of proteins accompanied by the formation of S\u2014S bonds spontaneously advanced under moderate oxidative conditions (Givol D. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1964, Sep.; 239:PC3114-16). However, it has been elucidated that, in a cell, there is a delicate system for the formation of S\u2014S bond, so that it can advance more quickly and correctly as compared with the aforementioned formation of S\u2014S bonds (Bardwell J. C., et al., Cell, 1991 Nov. 1; 67(3):581-9.). For example, in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, a series of proteins called Dsb factors (disulfide bond, DsbA, DsbB, DsbC (Shevchik V. E., et al., EMBO J., 1994 Apr. 15; 13(8):2007-12), DsbD (Missiakas D., et al., EMBO J., 1995 Jul. 17; 14(14):3415-24), and DsbG (Andersen C. L., et al., Mol. Microbiol., 1997, Oct.; 26(1):121-32)) form disulfide bonds and introduce them into many proteins. In the periplasm, DsbA (disulfide oxidoreductase) oxidizes a substrate protein (AmpC, DsbB, LivK, OstA, RcsF (Kadokura H., et al., Science, 2004, Jan. 23; 303(5657):534-7)), and the cysteine pair of DsbA converted into the reduced type is re-oxidized with the intracellular membrane protein DsbB. It has been elucidated that electrons received by DsbB are transferred to ubiquinone (UQ), which is a respiratory chain component, and oxygen eventually serves as an electron acceptor with the aid of cytochrome oxidase (Inaba K., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279, 6761-6768 (2004)).",
                        "Although DsbA has superior characteristics as an S\u2014S bond-introducing enzyme, the ability thereof to select a cysteine pair into which the bond is introduced is not sufficient. It has also been found that the enzyme DsbC (disulfide isomerase) which recombines incorrect S\u2014S bonds is present in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. In order for DsbC to function as an isomerase, the active site thereof must be maintained as a reduced type, contrary to DsbA, which is an oxidase. It is considered that the source of the reducing power originates in the thioredoxin system existing in the cytoplasm, and the reducing power from thioredoxin is transferred to DsbC via an intracellular membrane protein DsbD (Rietsch A., et al., J. Bacteriol., 1997 November; 179(21):6602-8). Moreover, it is also considered that a protein called DsbG which shows narrower substrate specificity is also present in Escherichia coli, and it has activities of both disulfide oxidoreductase and disulfide isomerase (Andersen C. L., et al., Mol. Microbiol., 1997, Oct.; 26(1):121-32).",
                        "As for the use of the aforementioned Dsb family, there are such findings as mentioned below, with expecting the effect of correctly forming S\u2014S bonds of proteins. Many proteins derived from eukaryotic organisms have a disulfide bond, and they cannot be expected to have their original structures when they are expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, which is under severe reducing conditions. Therefore, it is considered that, for production of such proteins derived from eukaryotic organisms, expression in the form of secretion into the periplasm is effective, which is under an oxidative environment preferred for formation of disulfide bond. However, although many attempts of expressing heterogenous proteins by secretion into Escherichia coli periplasm have been reported, any heterogenous protein cannot necessarily be expressed as active proteins. This poses a problem especially for proteins having many disulfide bonds. Meanwhile, in Escherichia coli, the roles of DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, and DsbD, which are the Dsb family proteins involved in the formation of disulfide bond, were deduced on the basis of biochemical tests and complementation tests using strains deficient in each of the genes (Bardwell, J. C., Mol. Microbiol., 14, 199-205 (1994), Sone, M., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272, 10349-10352 (1997), Rietsch, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 13048-13053 (1996)). Therefore, there have been made several attempts of overexpressing DsbA or DsbC together with an objective protein with the goal of improving the secretion expression of the objective protein into the periplasm (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-83670). Furthermore, it is also already known that DsbA works as a re-activating agent for proteins that do not have physiological activity (Akiyama Y., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1992 Nov. 5; 267(31):22440-5, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-336986). However, only the oxidation of proteins has been described in the reports to date, and there is no example of reporting involvement of the Dsb factors in oxidation of low molecules such as amino acids. Therefore, it has been completely unknown whether the Dsb factors oxidize low molecular weight molecules such as cysteine to form cystine."

Furthermore, the bacterium has been modified to increase the activity of the protein encoded by the dsbA gene. The \u201cability to produce L-cysteine\u201d or the \u201cL-cysteine-producing ability\u201d means an ability of the bacterium to produce L-cysteine and cause accumulation of L-cysteine in a medium or the bacterial cells in such an amount that the L-cysteine can be collected from the medium or cells when the bacterium is cultured in the medium. A bacterium having L-cysteine-producing ability means a bacterium which can produce and cause accumulation of a larger amount of L-cysteine as compared with a wild-type, parent, or unmodified strain, for example, a bacterium which can produce and cause accumulation of L-cysteine in a medium in an amount of 0.05 g/L or more, 0.1 g/L or more, or even 0.2 g/L or more.",
                                "The L-cysteine produced by the bacterium can change into L-cystine in the medium by the formation of a disulfide bond. Especially, as described later, it is considered that if L-cysteine is produced in a large amount by enhancing the DsbA activity, formation of L-cystine from L-cysteine by the DsbA-DsbB-UQ oxidation system is promoted. Furthermore, S-sulfocysteine can be generated by the reaction of L-cysteine and thiosulfuric acid in the medium (Szczepkowski T. W., Nature, vol. 182 (1958)). Furthermore, the L-cysteine generated in bacterial cells can be condensed with a ketone, aldehyde, or, for example, pyruvic acid, which is present in the cells, to produce a thiazolidine derivative via a hemithioketal intermediate (refer to Japanese Patent No. 2992010). This thiazolidine derivative and hemithioketal can be present as an equilibrated mixture. Therefore, the L-cysteine-producing ability is not limited to the ability to accumulate only L-cysteine in the medium or cells, but also includes the ability to accumulate L-cystine or its derivatives or precursors, or a mixture thereof in the medium. Examples of the aforementioned derivative of L-cysteine or L-cystine include, for example, S-sulfocysteine, thiazolidine derivatives, hemithioketal, and so forth. Examples of the precursor of L-cysteine or L-cystine include, for example, O-acetylserine, which is a precursor of L-cysteine. The precursors of L-cysteine or L-cystine also include derivatives of the precursors, and examples include, for example, N-acetylserine, which is a derivative of O-acetylserine, and so forth.",

OAS is a metabolite of bacteria and plants, and is produced by acetylation of L-serine by an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase (SAT). OAS is further converted into L-cysteine in cells.",

In addition to these, also employable is making DNA-recipient cells into protoplasts or spheroplasts, which can easily take up recombinant DNA, followed by introducing the recombinant DNA into the cells, which is known to be applicable to Bacillus subtilis, actinomycetes and yeasts (Chang, S, and Choen, S.

As sequences whose multiple copies are present in genomic DNA, repetitive DNA, and inverted repeats existing at the end of a transposable element can be used. Another dsbA gene can be introduced aside the dsbA gene existing on a genome in tandem, or it can be introduced into an unnecessary gene on a genome in a plural number.

For example, the lac promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter, tac promoter, araBA promoter, lambda phage PR promoter and PL promoter, tet promoter, T7 promoter, \u03a610 promoter, and so forth are known as strong promoters. Furthermore, the promoter of the threonine operon of E. coli can also be used. A promoter or SD region of the dsbA gene can also be modified so as to become stronger by introducing a nucleotide substitution or the like. Examples of methods for evaluating strength of a promoter and strong promoters are described in the paper of Goldstein et al. (Prokaryotic promoters in biotechnology, Biotechnol. Annu. Rev., 1, 105-128 (1995)) and so forth. In addition, it is known that substitution of several nucleotides in a spacer between the ribosome binding site (RBS) and translation initiation codon, especially a sequence immediately upstream from the initiation codon, greatly affects mRNA translation efficiency, and therefore this sequence can be modified. Expression control regions such as promoter of the dsbA gene can also be identified by using a promoter probe vector or gene analysis software such as GENETYX. By such substitution or modification of promoter as described above, expression of the dsbA gene is enhanced. Substitution of an expression control sequence can also be attained by, for example, a method using a temperature sensitive plasmid or Red-driven integration (WO2005/010175).",

Homologues of DsbA are known for many bacteria, and can be found by search of databases. When proteins highly homologous to the DsbA protein of the E. coli K-12 strain are searched for on the basis of sequence information, the search can be performed as, for example, BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi).

Although the number of the \u201cone or several\u201d amino acid residues can differ depending on their position in the three-dimensional structure or the types of amino acid residues of the proteins, it can be 1 to 20, 1 to 10, or even 1 to 5. These substitutions, deletions, insertions, or additions of one or several amino acid residues can be conservative mutations so that the function of the protein is maintained. A conservative mutation is a mutation wherein substitution takes place mutually among Phe, Trp and Tyr, if the substitution site is an aromatic amino acid; among Leu, Ile and Val, if the substitution site is a hydrophobic amino acid; between Gln and Asn, if it is a polar amino acid; among Lys, Arg and His, if it is a basic amino acid; between Asp and Glu, if it is an acidic amino acid; and between Ser and Thr, if it is an amino acid having a hydroxyl group. Typical examples of conservative mutations are conservative substitutions. Specific examples of conservative substitutions include: substitution of Ser or Thr for Ala; substitution of Gln, His or Lys for Arg; substitution of Glu, Gln, Lys, His or Asp for Asn; substitution of Asn, Glu or Gln for Asp; substitution of Ser or Ala for Cys; substitution of Asn, Glu, Lys, His, Asp or Arg for Gln; substitution of Gly, Asn, Gln, Lys or Asp for Glu; substitution of Pro for Gly; substitution of Asn, Lys, Gln, Arg or Tyr for His; substitution of Leu, Met, Val or Phe for Ile; substitution of Ile, Met, Val or Phe for Leu; substitution of Asn, Glu, Gln, His or Arg for Lys; substitution of Ile, Leu, Val or Phe for Met; substitution of Trp, Tyr, Met, Ile or Leu for Phe; substitution of Thr or Ala for Ser; substitution of Ser or Ala for Thr; substitution of Phe or Tyr for Trp; substitution of His, Phe or Trp for Tyr; and substitution of Met, Ile or Leu for Val. The above-mentioned amino acid substitution, deletion, insertion, addition, inversion etc. can be a result of a naturally-occurring mutation or variation due to an individual difference or a difference of species of a microorganism as an origin of gene (mutant or variant).",

                        "The 3,985 clones of the Keio collection were cultured at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 hours in 0.5 ml of LB liquid medium. This culture medium was stamped on LB agar media containing cysteine at different concentrations (0, 15, 20, 25 mM), and culture was performed overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Clones that were cysteine sensitive at the growth inhibition concentration of cysteine for wild-type strains (20 mM) were visually selected. Specifically, clones that did not form colonies on the LB plate containing 15 mM cysteine were selected as candidates. A dsbA gene-deficient strain was obtained as a clone showing particularly strong and distinctive cysteine sensitivity among the above candidates.",
                        "DsbA localizes in the periplasm, and forms disulfide bond (S\u2014S bond) in a substrate protein by utilizing the oxidized state (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014) and the reduced state (\u2014SH/\u2014SH) of two cysteine residues of DsbA itself to induce folding of the substrate protein. At the time of the S\u2014S bond formation of the substrate protein, the cysteine residues of DsbA changes from those of the oxidized type (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014) into the reduced type (\u2014SH/\u2014SH). As a protein that recycles the reduced type DsbA produced as described above into the oxidized type, DsbB is known. It was elucidated that the electrons received by DsbB are transferred to ubiquinone (UQ), which is a respiratory chain component, and oxygen finally serves as an electron acceptor with the aid of cytochrome oxidase. Therefore, a series of these DsbA, DsbB, and the respiratory chain system play a role of performing the oxidative crosslinking reaction of cysteine residues on a substrate protein. Although it was known that the cysteine residues in a protein were used as a substrate as described above, it was unpredictable that the addition of a low molecule cysteine itself had a certain influence on that system.",

Furthermore, as for the to/C gene (Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-040167, Wiriyathanawudhiwong, N. et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. (2009) 81:903-913), which was previously obtained in a similar manner, and of which deletion is known to induce cysteine sensitivity, a similar experiment was performed by using a to/C-deficient strain. The dsbA-deficient strain and to/C-deficient strain used in this experiment were JW3832 strain and JW5503 strain, respectively (both were included in the Keio collection), and their parent strain was the BW25113 strain (Andreas Haldimann, A. and Wanner, B. L., J. Bacteriol., 2001 November, 183 (21):6384-6393). The plasmids carrying the dsbA gene and the to/C gene for the complementation experiment were pDsbA and pTo1C (ASKA clone (Kitagawa, M., et al., 2005, DNA Res., 12:291-299)), and the vector used as the base of them was pCA24 (vector for ASKA clone (Kitagawa, M., et al., 2005, DNA Res., 12:291-299)).",

The culture was serially diluted 10 times for every dilution with 0.9% physiological saline to prepare serially diluted cell suspensions (10\u22122 to 10\u22126), and the cell suspensions were spotted (5 \u03bcl) onto L agar medium (10 g/L of Bacto trypton, 5 g/L of Bacto yeast extract, 5 g/L of NaCl, 15 g/L of agar) containing various concentrations (10, 15, 20 mM) of cysteine. Culture was performed at 37\u00b0 C. overnight, and growth tests of the dsbA-deficient strain and the to/C-deficient strain in the cysteine medium, and complementation (recovery of growth) tests with the dsbA plasmid and the to/C plasmid were performed. The results are shown in FIG. 1. The dsbA-deficient strain JW3832/pCA24 and the to/C-deficient strain JW5503/pCA24 showed marked cysteine sensitivity as compared with the control strain BW25113/pCA24, and when the dsbA and to/C gene were introduced as plasmids (JW3832/pDsbA strain, JW5503/pTolC strain), the strains recovered from the sensitivity.

It is known that YdeD is a secretion protein localizing at cell membranes, and participates in transportation from cytoplasm to periplasm (Dasler, T. et al., Mol. Microbiol., 2000, 36:1101-1112). Therefore, it is estimated that if YdeD is highly expressed, the supply of cysteine to the periplasm is increased.",

Syst. Biol., 2:2006.0008). As a plasmid carrying the dsbB gene, pDsbB (ASKA clone, Kitagawa, M. et al., 2005, DNA Res., 12:291-9) was used.",

The BamHI site was designed in both the primers. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI, and then inserted into pSTV29 (Takara) at the BamHI site, and the obtained plasmid in which the ydeD gene fragment was inserted in the same direction as the lacZ gene on the pSTV29 vector was designated plasmid pYdeD. The amplified portion was sequenced by PCR to confirm that it did not contain a mutation.",
                        "In order to distinguish the oxidized state and the reduced state of the DsbA protein, the protein was modified with AMS (4-acetamido-4\u2032-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2\u2032-disulfonate) (Kadokura, H. et al., 2004, Science, 303, 534-537). Each of the wild-type strain, the dsbA-deficient strain, the dsbB-deficient strain, the wild-type strain +pYdeD and the dsbB-deficient strain +pDsbB was cultured overnight at 30\u00b0 C. in 3 ml of LB medium, and the resulting culture was used as a preculture medium. The preculture medium was inoculated into the LB medium in a 1% amount, and culture was performed at 30\u00b0 C. with shaking until OD660 reached 0.4 to 0.5. Then, cysteine was added at 5 mM as the final concentration to expose the cells to cysteine for 20 minutes. The oxidized and reduced states of the DsbA protein were examined by the method of Ito et al. (Kobayashi, T., Kishigami, S., Sone, M., Inokuchi, H., Mogi, T. and Ito K., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 11857-11862). That is, after giving the stress, 100 \u03bcl of TCA (trichloroacetic acid, final concentration: 16.7%) was immediately added to 0.5 ml of the culture medium (OD660 was about 0.5), and the mixture was stirred, left standing on ice for 20 minutes to precipitate the cells, and centrifuged to collect the cells. Then, 700 \u03bcl of acetone was added to the obtained precipitates, the mixture was stirred, then left standing on ice for 20 minutes, and recentrifuged to collect the cells. The precipitates were dissolved in a solution of 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 10 mM 4-acetamido-4\u2032-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2\u2032-disulfonate (AMS, Invitrogen) prepared immediately before use.",

The nitrocellulose membrane after the blotting was shaken in a blocking solution (TTBS containing 3% of skim milk, 0.05% (wt/vol) of Tween 20, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl) for 1 hour. The membrane was washed with TTBS, and then shaken in a primary antibody solution (anti-DsbA blood serum (rabbit), Kadokura, H. et al., 2004, Science, 303, 534-537) for 1 hour. The membrane was washed with TTBS, and then shaken in a secondary antibody solution (TTBS containing 0.2% of peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) and 3% of albumin). The label was detected by using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham).",
                        "The results are shown in FIG. 2. From the fact that no band was detected for the dsbA-deficient strain, and the appearance of the bands for the dsbB-deficient strain and dsbB-deficient strain +pDsbB, it was confirmed that the oxidized type and reduced type of DsbA were correctly detected. When cysteine was not added, only the oxidized type DsbA was observed for the wild-type strain. However, the reduced type DsbA accumulated after exposure to cysteine (reduction stress), and the DsbA-DsbB complex also markedly accumulated. Moreover, it was found that the reduced type DsbA also accumulated in the wild-type strain when YdeD was highly expressed in that strain. The DsbA-DsbB-UQ oxidation system is originally a system for disulfide bond formation in proteins. However, it was found that when cysteine excessively existed, it worked to oxidize it into cystine, and thus the reduced type DsbA accumulated.",

                        "Since it was elucidated that the reduced type DsbA was accumulated by cysteine (reduction stress), it was decided to investigate toxicity of cysteine and oxidized and reduced states of a protein in the periplasm. The OstA is a protein in the periplasm indispensable to growth, and requires disulfide bond formed by DsbA. In order to investigate the oxidized and reduced states of the OstA protein, the E. coli BW25113 strain as the wild-type parent strain and the dsbA-deficient JW3832 strain derived from the BW25113 strain were used, and the plasmid pmyc-OstA for expressing OstA fused with an Myc tag (Kadokura, H. et al., 2004, Science, 303, 534-537) was introduced into them. Under the same culture conditions as those of the aforementioned experiment for investigating the oxidized and reduced states of DsbA, addition of L-cysteine (final concentration: 5 mM) and modification of the protein with AMS (4-acetamido-4\u2032-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2\u2032-disulfonate) were performed, and the OstA protein was detected by Western blotting. As the antibody, anti-Myc (mouse) was used in this experiment.",
                        "The results are shown in FIG. 3. It was found that, in the DsbA-deficient strain, all of the OstA proteins are the reduced type, irrespective of addition or no addition of cysteine. In the wild-type strain, when there was no cysteine, the OstA protein was the oxidized type with correctly formed disulfide bond, but the reduced type accumulated after the addition of cysteine. It was elucidated that the reduced type DsbA accumulated due to cysteine (reduction stress), accordingly the OstA protein which is as an essential protein was not correctly oxidized, and this constituted one of toxicities of cysteine for growth. On the basis of the above consideration, it was considered that enhancement of DsbA was effective in an environment where cysteine abundantly existed such as that of cysteine production by fermentation.",

The construction of pACYC-DES is described in EP 1528108 B1. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effect of overexpression of DsbA on cysteine production, cysteine-producing bacteria introduced with pDsbA or an empty vector pCA24N serving as a control were constructed.",

In this culture, tetracycline (10 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (30 \u03bcg/mL) were added to the medium in order to maintain the plasmids in the cells. The medium was temporally sampled, and production of cysteine, cystine, and cysteine-related compounds were analyzed after various periods. The composition of the SM1 medium used for the culture was as follows: 0.1 M KH2PO4\u2014K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0), 30 g/L of glucose, 10 g/L of (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 g/L of NaCl, 7.2 \u03bcM FeSO4.7H2O, 0.6 \u03bcM Na2MoO4, 40.4 \u03bcM H3BO3, 2.9 \u03bcM CoCl2, 1 \u03bcMl CuSO4, 8.1 \u03bcM MnCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2 (Dassler, T. et al., 2000, Mol.

Furthermore, a similar effect can be expected for enhancement of DsbC-DsbD or DsbG similar to the system of DsbA-DsbB. Enhancement of DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and DsbG in a cysteine-producing bacterium can be attained by, for example, introducing the ASKA clone plasmids of each gene into E. coli BW25113/pACYC-DES strain, as performed for obtaining the DsbA-enhanced strain. By culturing and analyzing each cysteine-producing bacterium prepared as described above in the same manners as those used in the experiments for DsbA-enhanced strain, it can be demonstrated that each gene has an effect of improving cysteine production."
