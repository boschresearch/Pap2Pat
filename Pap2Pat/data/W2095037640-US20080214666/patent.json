                        "Fatty acids (FA) belong to a physiologically important class of molecules involved in energy storage, membrane structure, and various signaling pathways. Different FA have different physical properties that determine their unique functions. Among the most abundant in animal cells as well as the most studied are those of straight long chain even numbered saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",
                        "Mono-methyl branched chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) are commonly found in many organisms from bacteria to mammals. In humans, they have been detected in skin, brain, blood, and cancer cells. Despite a broad distribution, mmBCFA remain exotic in eukaryotes, where their origin and physiological roles are not understood.",
                        "C15ISO and C17ISO are saturated tetradecanoic and hexadecanoic FAs with a single methyl group appended on the carbon next to the terminal carbon (FIG. 1). Both ISO and anteISO mono-methyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) also seem to be ubiquitous in nature. They are present in particularly large quantities in various bacterial genera, including cold-tolerating and thermophilic species. There, mmBCFA contribute to the membrane function regulating fluidity (Rilfors, Wieslander et al. 1978) and proton permeability (van de Vossenberg, Driessen et al. 1999).",
                        "Although comprehensive reports on mmBCFA in eukaryotes are lacking, sporadic data indicate that they are present in fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms. In mammals, mmBCFA have been detected in several tissues including skin, Verix caseosa, harderian and sebaceous glands, hair, brain, blood, and cancer cells. The fact that mmBCFA are present in a wide variety of organisms implies a conservation of the related metabolic enzymes and consequently important and perhaps unique functions for these molecules (Jones and Rivett 1997). Nevertheless, their physiological roles and metabolic regulations have not been systematically studied and thus remain fragmentary.",
                        "It has been found that C21anteISO is the major covalently bound FA in mammalian hair fibers. A removal of this FA from its protein counterparts results in a loss of hydrophobicity (Jones and Rivett 1997). Other studies indicated that C17anteISO esterified to cholesterol binds to and activates enzymes of protein biosynthesis (Tuhackova and Hradec 1985; Hradec and Dufek 1994). A potential significance of mmBCFA for human health is associated with a long observed correlation between amounts of these FAs and disease conditions such as brain deficiency (Ramsey, Scott et al. 1977) and cancer (Hradec and Dufek 1994). More recent studies have revealed a role of another mmBCFA, C15ISO, as a growth inhibitor of human cancer where it selectively induces apoptosis (Yang, Liu et al. 2000). Given how important these FA molecules may be and how little is known about their biosynthesis and functions in eukaryotes, it is an opportune problem to study.",
                        "De novo synthesis of long-chain mmBCFA described for bacteria is principally different from the biosynthesis of straight-chain FA (Oka and Kaneda 1988). While the latter uses acetyl-CoA as a primer condensing with a malonyl-CoA extender, BCFA synthesis starts with the branched-chain CoA primers derived from branched-chain amino acids; leucine, isoleucine, and valine. To synthesize BCFA, organisms must have a system of supplying branched-chain primers along with the enzymes utilizing them (Smith and Kaneda 1980). However, no such enzymes have been previously characterized in vivo in any eukaryotic organisms."

                        "The present invention generally relates to the present inventors' discoveries that have revealed significant information regarding the function and regulation of mmBCFA in the eukaryotes, and particularly, in C. elegans. Specifically, the inventors show herein that C. elegans synthesizes mmBCFA de novo using metabolites of leucine degradation as precursors and utilizes the long chain fatty acid elongation enzymes, ELO-5 and ELO-6, to produce long chain mmBCFA. The biosynthesis of long chain mmBCFA depends on activation of their precursor by mmBCFA-specific acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS-1).",
                        "The inventors have further discovered that mmBCFA are essential for C. elegans growth and development, and both ELO-5 and ACS-1 are essential for their production. Animals fully depleted of mmBCFA at the time of hatching develop severe morphological defects observed in all organs and prematurely die as small sick larvae or adults. This phenotype is reversible provided that mmBCFAs are available in a food.",
                        "The inventors have also discovered that mmBCFA with different length carbon backbones have different rescue abilities. The shorter C13 and C15 fatty acids (FA) rescue depleted larvae to wild type adults, whose progeny stops development at the first larval stage, L1. The arrest is reversible and can be overcome by feeding the arrested animals with C17 mmBCFA. The ability of C13, C15, and C17 to rescue the mmBCFA-depleted phenotype requires the activity of ACS-1. In the absence of the ACS-1 function, all three FA species rescue mmBCFA-depleted animals to wild type fertile adult, but their progeny die as early embryos.",
                        "The inventors have also shown that the correlation between amounts of the supplement and rescue ability is nonlinear in the C13ISO experiments. Specifically, concentrations of C13ISO in a range 0-0.5 mM does not rescue elo-5-depleted animals, at concentrations above 0.75 mM, 100% of animals reach adulthood and have progeny. The growth and maturation rate in these cases are equal to the growth and maturation of the wild-type animals on the similarly supplemented plates. A further increase in concentration of the supplement (to 2.5-10 mM) results in slowing at the L4 stage accompanied by a delay the adult maturation. However, the developmental delay does not seem to be harmful. To the contrary, the animals are healthy, continue to actively lay eggs in contrast to controls, and maintain a wild type brood size. This ability of C13ISO to modulate growth rate between L4 and adult stage is shared by C15ISO and C17ISO, but not by saturated and monounsaturated FA of the 16-18 carbon backbone, and it is not related to gross changes in FA composition of total lipids.",
                        "The inventors have also discovered that ACS-1 is required for embryogenesis. Animals depleted of functional ACS-1 experience a failure in cellularization resulting in multinucleated blastomeres (polyploidy) and eventually in embryonic lethality. This embryonic lethality can be partially rescued by the mutation in zen-4, encoding a homologue of mammalian kinesin-like protein-1, suggesting a genetic interaction between zen-4 and acs-1. Furthermore, the data provided herein show that a suppression of acs-1 affects formation of eggshell and adult cuticle in C. elegans. The inventors show that ACS-1 determines the architecture of cuticle and its physical properties (osmotic resistance and withstanding a mechanical pressure).",
                        "The inventors have also discovered a relationship between mmBCFA, the DAF pathway (insulin signaling pathway), and food signaling in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, the inventors show that there is a genetic interaction between acs-1, essential for mmBCFA synthesis, and DAF insulin/TGF beta pathway possibly up-stream of DAF-9 (cytochrome P450) in regulation of molting. A deficiency of mmBCFA activates the expression of targets of the transcriptional regulator DAF-16 (pnk-1 and sod-3), and stimulates the nuclear translocation of DAF-16. Therefore, mmBCFA deficiency appears to upregulate the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway. Furthermore, elo-5 is down-regulated in animals that are depleted of functional K01G5.1, which encodes a predicted transcription factor that may bind to DAF-16. In addition, L1 arrest caused by mmBCFA deficiency precedes (in developmental scale) the L1 arrest in mid-L1 stage caused by starvation, but C17ISO, in conjunction with a bacterial feeding, rescues the animals to normal growth and development. In the absence of the mmBCFA, the animals can feed on the bacteria, but are unable to process the \u201cfood signal\u201d that initiates growth and development in wild type larvae. Since L1 animals are not competent for dauer formation, these data indicate that mmBCFA interferes with the insulin/DAF signaling that is not related to dauer formation. Moreover, a deficiency of mmBCFA stimulates nuclear translocation of DAF-16. Therefore, mmBCFA are believed to regulate the food sensation and food processing system.",
                        "The connection of mmBCFA to the insulin-signaling pathway is further confirmed by studies showing that a deficiency of mmBCFA prevents a temperature-sensitive mutant that normally forms dauers at 20\u00b0 C. and 25\u00b0 C., from a proper transition into the dauer. Dauer formation in C. elegans is an adaptive response to unfavorable conditions such as overcrowding or starvation. In this state, metabolism is dramatically shifted toward energy storage as opposed to growth and development. daf-2 mutants tend to form dauers at restrictive temperatures, and the data described above now show that a deficiency of mmBCFA can interfere with the dauer formation.",
                        "The inventors have also shown that biosynthesis of mmBCFA is tightly linked to protein uptake. Specifically, functional inhibition of an oligopeptide transporter, which results in a reduction in protein uptake by the animals, resulted in a dramatic change in the FA composition of total lipids obtained from the animals. Particularly affected were the C15ISO and C17ISO fractions of the mmBCFA, which were significantly decreased in the mutant animals. The inventors have shown that this decrease is due not only to lack of substrate availability, but also to a transcriptional suppression of the mmBCFA elongation gene, elo-5. The transcriptional control over elo-5 was further shown to be mediated by the TOR pathway, which regulates gene expression by nutrient sensing. Therefore, biosynthesis of mmBCFA is sensitive to dietary protein uptake, further confirming the association of mmBCFA with signaling related to food intake and processing.",
                        "The inventors have further shown that exogenous mmBCFA affects the expression of the pantothenate kinase (PNK-1) gene that is essential for CoA biosynthesis. Specifically, while a deficiency of mmBCFA causes upregulation of pnk-1, and downregulation of pnk-1 results in decreased mmBCFA biosynthesis, high levels of mmBCFA act as a negative feedback control and downregulate the expression of pnk-1, establishing a link between mmBCFA and CoA metabolism, which is essential for energy production. The combined discoveries that mmBCFA metabolism is responsive to exogenous protein up-take and the ability of mmBCFA to influence CoA biosynthesis further indicate a role for mmBCFA in coordination of the food signaling and energy expenditure.",
                        "Finally, the inventors have shown that mammalian cells are able to elongate C13ISO into C15ISO and C17ISO in vitro. Therefore, these cell lines can be used to evaluate the physiological effect of mmBCFA, to identify mmBCFA-related enzymes and mmBCFA signaling system in mammals, and to identify regulators of these processes.",
                        "Combining genetics and biochemistry, the present inventors have identified several key enzymes and regulatory proteins that are involved in biosynthesis and homeostasis of specific fatty acids that play critical roles in animal growth and development. More specifically, the present inventors have discovered that depletion of mmBCFA affects the expression of several genes, and the activities of some of these genes affect the biosynthesis of mmBCFA, suggesting a potential feedback regulation. One of the genes, lpd-1, encodes a homologue of a mammalian sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP 1c). The inventors have also obtained results that indicate that elo-5 and elo-6 may be transcriptional targets of LPD-1. The inventors have further discovered that a key enzyme of the coenzyme A biosynthesis, pantothenate kinase (PNK-1), modulates the mmBCFA but not other FA quantity.",
                        "The mmBCFA-specific elongases and acetyl-CoA ligase as well as the revealed feedback regulation network provide valuable targets for therapeutic agents. The C. elegans systems described herein are also useful for screening for pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Such systems can also be used to investigate or screen for regulators of metabolism, growth, development, and reproduction in eukaryotes. The present invention provides a foundation to build up an extraordinary experimental in vivo system that is both specific and discrete. Similar approaches (genetic manipulation and/or dietary supplementation) may be used on mammalian cell or other organism systems to explore pharmaceutical applications of the mmBCFA-involved biological processes.",
                        "Specifically, in one aspect of the invention, by applying a simple and efficient RNAi-feeding technique alone or with available knockout mutations, the inventors can shut down key enzymes of this particular type of long chain FA biosynthesis and activation. This results in depletion of internal source of these FA and ultimately in severe metabolic and morphological defects and premature death. By using a combination of the mutants, RNAi-targeted genes, and various dietary FA supplements, the inventors can rescue animals to discrete developmental stages: wild type adults, early embryos, and first larvae stage, as well as to full growth and proliferation.",
                        "A unique advantage of the present invention is in the versatile nature of the system of the present invention (described in detail below). It can be used for various tasks (e.g., targeting lipid metabolism, cell division (embryonic), growth and differentiation (postembryonic) as well as the food response, and more).",
                        "In addition, because this particular type of FA (mmBCFA) is found in humans, the system is also relevant to human health. Therefore, a variety of formulations, for use as dietary supplements, nutraceuticals or pharmaceutical formulations, are encompassed by the invention, as well as various strategies for impacting food sensing and insulin regulation, growth and development, reproduction, metabolism and homeostasis, and/or diseases associated with mmBCFA-deficiency or overproduction.",
                        "Prior to the present invention, intensive studies on mmBCFA have been only done in bacteria where mmBCFA biosynthesis and structural roles in membrane fluidity were shown. Indeed, although mmBCFA were first mentioned in 1823 (M.-E. Chevreul \u201cThe constitution of FAT\u201d), and many lipid biologists have been working on the FA since then, no one has shown the dramatic roles of C13, C15, and C17ISO as described herein. The present inventors are believed to be the first to describe any non-structural function of mmBCFA. In addition, the biosynthetic system for mmBCFA has never been described for eukaryotic cells prior to the present invention, and enzymes participating in this process, including mmBCFA-specific elongases and CoA ligases were not previously recognized and characterized with regard to the mmBCFA biosynthesis. Furthermore, regulatory elements of mmBCFA biosynthesis were not previously known. The involvement of SREBP and pantothenate kinase in regulating mmBCFA biosynthesis were not known, nor the existence of elo-5 and elo-6 as the targets of SREBP. In addition, to the best of the present inventors' knowledge, prior to the present invention, the function of mmBCFA in regulating animal growth, development, and reproduction, or its use in controlling these functions by dietary or genetic manipulation have not been described. Furthermore, the role of mmBCFA in food sensing and insulin signaling regulation have not previously been described. The physiological roles of C13ISO, C15ISO and C17ISO on the whole organism level have also never been mentioned in relation to eukaryotes, and the physiological differences between mmBCFA of different lengths of carbon backbone have never been reported.",
                        "In addition, the inventors have shown that not only C13ISO, C15ISO, and C17ISO, but also their methyl esters are biologically active. Added as food supplements, they rescue mmBCFA deficiency. Moreover, unlike C13ISO and C15ISO, the C13ISO-methyl ester and C15ISO-methyl ester supplements can be efficiently elongated to C17ISO. mmBCFA-methyl esters have better solubility in physiological solutions such as culture media and buffered-saline and possibly better permeability that mmBCFA that allows better absorption through the intestine. Therefore, addition of these compounds is physiologically equivalent to the C17ISO supplements.",
                        "Dietary mmBCFA are readily absorbed by animal cells. They incorporate into various lipid fractions (phospholipids and triacylglycerols) and, therefore, may be used as physiologically active supplements. Moreover, mmBCFA have no toxic effect in eukaryotic organisms such as C. elegans in concentrations up to at least 10 mM. mmBCFA are easily dissolved in 1% NP40 and DMSO. mmBCFA may be extracted from many bacterial species naturally producing ISO- and ante-ISO forms of mmBCFA, for example, or may be produced recombinantly. In addition, mmBCFA-carrying bacteria, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, may be used directly as sources of mmBCFA, without the need to purify, produce, or isolate the mmBCFA from the bacteria.",
                        "Fatty acid methyl esters are used extensively as intermediates in the manufacture of detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, stabilizers, textile treatments, and waxes among other applications. Lesser volumes of fatty acid methyl esters are used in a variety of direct and indirect food additive applications, including the dehydration of grapes to produce raisins, synthetic flavoring agents, and in metal lubricants for metallic articles intended for food contact use. Fatty acid methyl esters are also used as intermediates in the manufacture of a variety of food ingredients. Methyl esters, including methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl palmitoleate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate, methyl docosahexanoate, methyl ecosapentanoate are cleared by the FDA as a supplementary source of fat for animal feed under 21 CFR 573.640. However, a potential physiological value of mmBCFA methyl esters has never been reported. The use of methyl esters of mmBCFA as any of the above-mentioned intermediates and/or direct and indirect food additive applications or supplement uses is also encompassed by the present invention.",
                        "The inventors have also discovered that anteISO branched-chain FA, which cannot be synthesized by C. elegans, have a physiological potency similar to the ISO branched-chain FA. anteISO FA differ from ISO FA in a position of a single methyl attached to the third carbon from the terminal (FIG. 1). anteISO FA are abundant among bacterial FA.",
                        "One embodiment of the present invention relates to a model system for identifying, detecting, characterizing, and/or evaluating the regulation of mmBCFA (and their derivatives), for the purpose of evaluating and/or regulating processes associated with mmBCFA described herein, including, but not limited to, metabolism and/or homeostasis, organism growth, organism development, organism reproduction, food sensing and/or insulin signaling. The system includes non-human organisms or cells (from any organism, including human cells) in which the expression and/or bioactivity of at least one component (e.g., at least one gene or at least one enzyme or other protein) of an mmBCFA biosynthetic pathway has been modified so that the effects of the modification on mmBCFA (and their derivatives) and functions related thereto can be evaluated, and/or so that the effect of various regulatory agents on mmBCFA synthesis and metabolism can be evaluated. The components of an mmBCFA biosynthetic pathway can include any gene or portion thereof encoding any protein or domain or portion thereof that participates directly or indirectly in the mmBCFA biosynthetic pathway such that modification (e.g., upregulation or downregulation) of such a component has a detectable effect on mmBCFA biosynthesis. The inventors describe herein various components related to mmBCFA biosynthesis and function, using nomenclature from Caenorhabditis elegans. However, it is to be expressly understood that the discussion of genes and proteins involved in the biosynthesis and function of mmBCFA herein is not limited to C. elegans genes and proteins, but rather encompasses any functional homologue thereof from other eukaryotic organisms, and particularly from mammalian organisms, and most particularly, from humans. Therefore, the invention includes various specifically defined genes and proteins, functional homologues thereof from other eukaryotes (e.g., orthologs and other homologues that have the same specific biological activity as the reference protein), and biologically active portions (fragments) of such genes and proteins (described in more detail below). Components that have been identified by the present inventors as participating in the mmBCFA biosynthesis (as identified by the C. elegans counterparts) include, but are not limited to, the long chain fatty acid elongation enzymes ELO-5 and ELO-6, mmBCFA-specific acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS-1), LiPid Depleted 1 (LPD-1, homologue of SREBP), nuclear hormone receptor 49 (NHR-49), RuvB-like DNA binding protein, pantothenate kinase (PNK-1), branched-chain \u03b1-keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD), and any homologues or derivatives thereof, including homologous enzymes or proteins in various species having different nomenclature.",
                        "In one embodiment of the invention, a homologue is a functional homologue of the reference protein. The invention also includes orthologs of the proteins described herein. These terms are described in detail below. In one embodiment, a homologue includes a protein that is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes under low, moderate, high or very high stringency conditions to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein described herein. In another embodiment, a homologue includes a protein that is at least about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or at least about 95% identical to a protein described herein, or any increment between 30% and 99%, in whole percentage increments (31%, 32%, 33%, etc.). Methods for determining hybridization conditions and percent identity are discussed in detail below.",
                        "The system can also include organisms or cells having an intact mmBCFA biosynthesis capacity, whereby the effects of putative regulators on the \u201cwild-type\u201d or naturally occurring system can be evaluated. Functional and non-functional mmBCFA systems can be used in combination to fully evaluate the effects of various manipulations, components and putative regulatory compounds.",

Eukaryotic cells (rather than whole organisms) can also be used, including, but not limited to, any fungal cells (e.g., yeast), insect cells, algal cells, and mammalian cells (including human cells).",
                        "As used herein, a genetically modified organism can include any organism having a genome that is modified (i.e., mutated or changed) from its normal (i.e., wild-type or naturally occurring) form such that the desired result is achieved (i.e., increased, decreased or otherwise modified mmBCFA activity and/or production of a desired product using the mmBCFA system). Genetically modified organisms also include organisms having an intact or unmodified genome but have been modified by the introduction of additional genetic elements that remain extrachromosomal yet exert an effect on the organism (e.g., by the addition of RNAi that inhibits or silences the RNA encoding the protein, or by expression of an exogenous protein that exerts an effect on the mmBCFA system). Genetic modification of an organism can be accomplished using classical strain development and/or molecular biological techniques. Such techniques known in the art and are generally disclosed in the art. A genetically modified organism can include an organism in which nucleic acid molecules have been inserted, deleted or modified (i.e., mutated; e.g., by insertion, deletion, substitution, and/or inversion of nucleotides), in such a manner that such modifications provide the desired effect within the organism (e.g., deletion or inactivation of a gene or a protein encoded by the gene).",
                        "In one embodiment, the organism is modified to delete or inactivate a protein that is involved with or associated with the biosynthesis or function of mmBCFA as described herein. The deletion or inactivation can be achieved by any suitable method, and can be accomplished at the DNA level (deletion or inactivation of the gene encoding the protein or mutation of the gene so that an inactive protein is produced), at the RNA level (inhibition, silencing or elimination of the RNA encoding the protein or mutation of the RNA so that an inactive protein is produced) or at the protein level (by deletion or inactivation of the protein itself). Such proteins include any of the proteins described herein that are associated with mmBCFA biosynthesis or function, or that can affect or be used to evaluate mmBCFA biosynthesis or function (e.g., by the creation of organisms that are deficient in or overexpress such proteins), including, but not limited to: long chain fatty acid elongation enzyme ELO-5 (SEQ ID NO:10), long chain fatty acid elongase enzyme ELO-6 (SEQ ID NO:12), mmBCFA-specific acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS-1) (SEQ ID NO:14), LiPid Depleted 1 (LPD-1) (SEQ ID NO:16), nuclear hormone receptor 49 (NHR-49) (SEQ ID NO:18), RuvB-like DNA binding protein (RuvB-like) (SEQ ID NO:20), pantothenate kinase (PNK-1) (SEQ ID NO:22), branched-chain \u03b1-keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) (\u03b1 subunit-SEQ ID NO:24; pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit-SEQ ID NO:38), oligopeptide transporter PEP-2 (PEP-2) (SEQ ID NO:26); phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) (SEQ ID NO:28), insulin receptor DAF-2 (DAF-2) (SEQ ID NO:30), ZEN-4 (SEQ ID NO:32), POD-1 (SEQ ID NO:34), and SOD-3 (SEQ ID NO:36).",
                        "The present inventors have described a particularly suitable method for the modification of organisms to selectively modify the expression or production of particular enzymes and proteins in the model C. elegans system. This method uses RNA interference and specifically, the feeding of RNAi to C. elegans to interfere with the expression of specific components of the mmBCFA biosynthetic pathway and thereby disrupt various aspects of mmBCFA biosynthesis and corresponding biological activities of mmBCFA and their derivatives including growth, development and reproduction of the organism. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process whereby double stranded RNA, and in mammalian systems, short interfering RNA (siRNA), is used to inhibit or silence expression of complementary genes. In the target cell, siRNA are unwound and associate with an RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), which is then guided to the mRNA sequences that are complementary to the siRNA, whereby the RISC cleaves the mRNA. The C. elegans system useful in the present invention is described in detail in the Examples section.",

This publication also illustrates various techniques for manipulation of in vivo systems that can be used in the present invention. The present invention allows for the use of such systems to elucidate biochemical and biological pathways associated with mmBCFA, and provides extensive detail regarding components of the system. The SREBP expression system described in PCT Publication WO 00/76308 can be incorporated into the system and methods of the present invention to develop sophisticated methods for screening for regulators of mmBCFA biosynthesis, metabolism and homeostasis and associated biological/physiological processes. Alternatively, a combination of mmBCFA-related genetic engineering and dietary supplements can be used to separate SREBP functions associated with the mmBCFA production and its other biological roles. This \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach may provide a specific tool for determining how the SREBP activities in the various pathways interplay.",

Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention relates to methods to evaluate potential pharmaceutical, nutraceutical or dietary compounds and formulations for effects on mmBCFA metabolism and/or homeostasis (including food sensation and insulin signaling) or for effects on physiological systems related thereto, including growth, development and/or reproduction. For example, one may use the systems of the invention to provide an organism with impaired mmBCFA biosynthesis which may or may not result in impaired or altered growth, development and/or reproduction, and then test putative regulatory compounds to determine whether such compounds compensate for, correct, enhance or otherwise modify the phenotype of the organism or any genetic, biochemical or physiological characteristic, as compared to in the absence of the compound. Similarly, one may use the system of the invention to screen for the effects of various compounds and formulations on the intact or wild-type mmBCFA system or components thereof (genes and proteins encoded thereby) in a specific manner, now that many of the components in the system are known. Importantly, the various combinations of modifications and organisms can be used to construct many elegant and highly useful and specific systems for pharmaceutical and/or nutraceutical applications related to mmBCFA-associated biological processes. Such systems will be apparent to those of skill in the art given the disclosure provided herein and are encompassed by the present invention.",

Similarly, modifications, activities or interactions which result in an increase in protein expression or lipid biosynthesis, or an increase in the activity of the protein or lipid, can be referred to as amplification, overproduction, activation, enhancement, up-regulation or increased action of a protein or lipid. The biological activity of a protein or lipid according to the invention can be measured or evaluated using any assay for the biological activity of the protein or lipid as known in the art. For proteins, such assays can include, but are not limited to, binding assays, two hybrid systems, assays to determine internalization of the protein and/or associated proteins, enzyme assays, cell signal transduction assays (e.g., phosphorylation assays), and/or assays for determining downstream cellular events that result from activation or binding of the protein (e.g., expression of downstream genes, production of various biological mediators, etc.).

To detect expression of a target refers to the act of actively determining whether a target is expressed or not. This can include determining whether the target expression is upregulated as compared to a control, downregulated as compared to a control, or unchanged as compared to a control. Therefore, the step of detecting expression does not require that expression of the target actually is upregulated or downregulated, but rather, can also include detecting that the expression of the target has not changed (i.e., detecting no expression of the target or no change in expression of the target). Expression of transcripts and/or proteins is measured by any of a variety of known methods in the art. For RNA expression, methods include but are not limited to: extraction of cellular mRNA and Northern blotting using labeled probes that hybridize to transcripts encoding all or part of one or more of the genes of this invention; amplification of mRNA expressed from one or more of the genes of this invention using gene-specific primers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by quantitative detection of the product by any of a variety of means; extraction of total RNA from the cells, which is then labeled and used to probe cDNAs or oligonucleotides encoding all or part of the genes of this invention, arrayed on any of a variety of surfaces; in situ hybridization; and detection of a reporter gene. The term \u201cquantifying\u201d or \u201cquantitating\u201d when used in the context of quantifying transcription levels of a gene can refer to absolute or to relative quantification. Absolute quantification may be accomplished by inclusion of known concentration(s) of one or more target nucleic acids and referencing the hybridization intensity of unknowns with the known target nucleic acids (e.g. through generation of a standard curve). Alternatively, relative quantification can be accomplished by comparison of hybridization signals between two or more genes, or between two or more treatments to quantify the changes in hybridization intensity and, by implication, transcription level.",

In addition, compositions of the invention may be used as novel compositions to control the ratios and compositions of different fatty acids in an organism, including fatty acids other than mmBCFA. With regard to the latter, a use of gas chromatography analysis of FA composition in total lipids obtained from a whole organism or individual tissues and cells is suggested to monitor changes in FA homeostasis. This method could be used, for example, for confirmation in a screen for compounds that compensate for the mmBCFA deficiency. Alternatively, one could modify the total fatty acid profile in an organism by manipulating (up or down) the mmBCFA in the organism as described herein.",

A nutraceutical formulation is typically a formulation that is a combination of nutritional (or dietary) and pharmaceutical product and is intended to be used to provide enhanced health benefits to an individual. Regulatory processes are typically more strict for pharmaceutical formulations than for nutraceutical formulations. Dietary formulations are more typically considered to be any health-enhancing or health-maintaining product derived from nature and would typically be used to supplement the diet of an individual to provide a positive health benefit, and might help prevent a disease or condition, but is not necessarily intended to treat a disease or condition.

Typically, it is desirable to obtain a therapeutic or nutritional benefit in a patient. A therapeutic benefit is not necessarily a cure for a particular disease or condition, but rather, preferably encompasses a result which can include alleviation of the disease or condition, elimination of the disease or condition, reduction of a symptom associated with the disease or condition, prevention or alleviation of a secondary disease or condition resulting from the occurrence of a primary disease or condition, and/or prevention of the disease or condition. As used herein, the phrase \u201cprotected from a disease\u201d refers to reducing the symptoms of the disease; reducing the occurrence of the disease, and/or reducing the severity of the disease. Protecting a patient can refer to the ability of a composition of the present invention, when administered to a patient, to prevent a disease from occurring and/or to cure or to alleviate disease symptoms, signs or causes.

                        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a long chain MMBCFA or precursor thereof is administered to a patient that has Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). MSUD is caused by the inability to metabolize the branched-chain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Urine from these patients has an odor that is reminiscent of maple syrup or burnt sugar, thus the name. Untreated, MUSD causes ketoacidosis, neurological damage (e.g., mental retardation) and death. Conventional treatments for MUSD include the strict use of a special diet that contains very low levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine to avoid the accumulation of these amino acids in the body of the patient. Since the branched-chain amino acids are precursors of the mmBCFA that are now shown herein to be important to a diverse array of physiological functions, such functions may be impaired in patients having restricted branched chain amino acid intake. Therefore, the present invention provides for the dietary supplementation of patients with MUSD with long chain mmBCFA or precursors thereof, including C13ISO, C15ISO, C17ISO, C15ante-ISO, C17-anteISO and/or any derivative thereof, including methyl esters of any of these mmBCFAs.

As such, \u201cisolated\u201d does not reflect the extent to which the protein has been purified. An isolated protein useful according to the present invention can be isolated from its natural source, produced recombinantly or produced synthetically. Smaller peptides useful as regulatory peptides are typically produced synthetically by methods well known to those of skill in the art.",

Such changes include, but are not limited to: changes in one or a few amino acid side chains; changes one or a few amino acids, including deletions (e.g., a truncated version of the protein or peptide) insertions and/or substitutions; changes in stereochemistry of one or a few atoms; and/or minor derivatizations, including but not limited to: methylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, myristoylation, prenylation, palmitation, amidation and/or addition of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol. A homologue can have either enhanced, decreased, or substantially similar properties as compared to the naturally occurring protein or peptide. A homologue can include an agonist of a protein or an antagonist of a protein. A functional homologue is a homologue of a reference protein that may have any degree of structural similarity to the reference protein and has the same or essentially the same function as the reference protein. Typically, a functional homologue is structurally similar to the reference protein at least at conserved regions of the protein that are required for the function of the protein (e.g., catalytic domain, substrate binding site, cofactor binding site, DNA binding site, receptor or ligand binding site, signal transduction domains). An ortholog is an example of a functional homologue. Therefore, reference to a homologue can include an ortholog. An ortholog is a gene in two or more species that has evolved from a common ancestor and therefore has a common function. An ortholog is also called an orthologous gene.",
                        "Homologues can be the result of natural allelic variation or natural mutation. A naturally occurring allelic variant of a nucleic acid encoding a protein is a gene that occurs at essentially the same locus (or loci) in the genome as the gene which encodes such protein, but which, due to natural variations caused by, for example, mutation or recombination, has a similar but not identical sequence. Allelic variants typically encode proteins having similar activity to that of the protein encoded by the gene to which they are being compared. One class of allelic variants can encode the same protein but have different nucleic acid sequences due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Allelic variants can also comprise alterations in the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated regions of the gene (e.g., in regulatory control regions). Allelic variants are well known to those skilled in the art.",

Thus, an isolated nucleic acid molecule does not encompass isolated total genomic DNA or an isolated chromosome. As used herein, the term \u201cgene\u201d has the meaning that is well known in the art, that is, a nucleic acid sequence that includes the translated sequences that code for a protein (\u201cexons\u201d) and the untranslated intervening sequences (\u201cintrons\u201d), and any regulatory elements necessary to transcribe and/or translate the protein. Included in the invention are nucleic acid molecules that are less than a full-length gene or less than a full-length coding sequence, such as fragments of a gene or coding sequence comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of, for example, a fragment of any of the nucleic acid sequences for target genes described in the present invention. A coding sequence can include genomic DNA without introns, cDNA or RNA that encodes a protein. An isolated nucleic acid molecule can also include a specified nucleic acid sequence flanked by (i.e., at the 5\u2032 and/or the 3\u2032 end of the sequence) additional nucleic acids that do not normally flank the specified nucleic acid sequence in nature (i.e., are heterologous sequences).",

A nucleic acid molecule homologue can be produced using a number of methods known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Sambrook et al., ibid.). For example, nucleic acid molecules can be modified using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, classical mutagenesis techniques and recombinant DNA techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis, chemical treatment of a nucleic acid molecule to induce mutations, restriction enzyme cleavage of a nucleic acid fragment, ligation of nucleic acid fragments, PCR amplification and/or mutagenesis of selected regions of a nucleic acid sequence, synthesis of oligonucleotide mixtures and ligation of mixture groups to \u201cbuild\u201d a mixture of nucleic acid molecules and combinations thereof. Nucleic acid molecule homologues can be selected from a mixture of modified nucleic acids by screening for the function of the protein encoded by the nucleic acid and/or by hybridization with a wild-type gene.",
                        "The term isolated nucleic acid molecule does not necessarily connote any specific minimum length unless set forth by reference to a minimum number of nucleotides or by a function of the nucleic acid molecule. The minimum size of a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is generally a size sufficient to encode a protein having the desired biological activity, a size sufficient to inhibit the expression and/or activity of a target as described herein, a size sufficient for use in a screening assay of the invention, or a size sufficient to form a probe or oligonucleotide primer that is capable of forming a stable hybrid with the complementary sequence of a nucleic acid molecule. As such, the size of a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be dependent on nucleic acid composition and percent homology or identity between the nucleic acid molecule and complementary sequence as well as upon hybridization conditions per se (e.g., temperature, salt concentration, and formamide concentration) and the intended use of the nucleic acid molecule. The minimal size of a nucleic acid molecule that is used as an oligonucleotide primer or as a probe is typically at least about 12 to about 15 nucleotides in length if the nucleic acid molecules are GC-rich and at least about 15 to about 18 bases in length if they are AT-rich. There is no limit, other than a practical limit, on the maximal size of a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, in that the nucleic acid molecule can include a fragment of a gene, a portion of a protein encoding sequence, or a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length protein (including a complete gene).",

According to the present invention, a recombinant vector is an engineered (i.e., artificially produced) nucleic acid molecule that is used as a tool for manipulating a nucleic acid sequence of choice and for introducing such a nucleic acid sequence into a host cell. The recombinant vector is therefore suitable for use in cloning, sequencing, and/or otherwise manipulating the nucleic acid sequence of choice, such as by expressing and/or delivering the nucleic acid sequence of choice into a host cell to form a recombinant cell. Such a vector typically contains heterologous nucleic acid sequences, that is nucleic acid sequences that are not naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid sequence to be cloned or delivered, although the vector can also contain regulatory nucleic acid sequences (e.g., promoters, untranslated regions) which are naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid molecules of the present invention or which are useful for expression of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (discussed in detail below). The vector can be either RNA or DNA, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and typically is a plasmid. The vector can be maintained as an extrachromosomal element (e.g., a plasmid) or it can be integrated into the chromosome of a recombinant organism (e.g., a microbe or a plant). The entire vector can remain in place within a host cell, or under certain conditions, the plasmid DNA can be deleted, leaving behind the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention. The integrated nucleic acid molecule can be under chromosomal promoter control, under native or plasmid promoter control, or under a combination of several promoter controls. Single or multiple copies of the nucleic acid molecule can be integrated into the chromosome. A recombinant vector of the present invention can contain at least one selectable marker.",

In this embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the product to be produced is inserted into the recombinant vector to produce a recombinant nucleic acid molecule. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein to be produced is inserted into the vector in a manner that operatively links the nucleic acid sequence to regulatory sequences in the vector that enable the transcription and translation of the nucleic acid sequence within the recombinant host cell.",

Such a vector may also be known in the art as a \u201cknock-out\u201d vector. In one aspect of this embodiment, a portion of the vector, but more typically, the nucleic acid molecule inserted into the vector (i.e., the insert), has a nucleic acid sequence that is homologous to a nucleic acid sequence of a target gene in the host cell (i.e., a gene which is targeted to be deleted or inactivated). The nucleic acid sequence of the vector insert is designed to bind to the target gene such that the target gene and the insert undergo homologous recombination, whereby the endogenous target gene is deleted, inactivated or attenuated (i.e., by at least a portion of the endogenous target gene being mutated or deleted).",

Transcription control sequences are sequences that control the initiation, elongation, or termination of transcription. Particularly important transcription control sequences are those that control transcription initiation, such as promoter, enhancer, operator and repressor sequences. Suitable transcription control sequences include any transcription control sequence that can function in a host cell or organism into which the recombinant nucleic acid molecule is to be introduced.",

                        "\u201cHybridization\u201d has the meaning that is well known in the art, that is, the formation of a duplex structure by two single-stranded nucleic acids due to complementary base pairing. Hybridization can occur between exactly complementary nucleic acid strands or between nucleic acid strands that contain some regions of mismatch. As used herein, reference to hybridization conditions refers to standard hybridization conditions under which nucleic acid molecules are used to identify similar nucleic acid molecules. Such standard conditions are disclosed, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Labs Press, 1989. Sambrook et al., ibid., is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety (see specifically, pages 9.31-9.62). In addition, formulae to calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to achieve hybridization permitting varying degrees of mismatch of nucleotides are disclosed, for example, in Meinkoth et al., 1984, Anal. Biochem. 138, 267-284; Meinkoth et al., ibid., is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \u201cStringent hybridization\u201d has a meaning well-established in the art, that is, hybridization performed at a salt concentration of no more than 1M and a temperature of at least 25 degrees Celsius. For example, conditions of 5\u00d7SSPE (750 mM NaCl, 50 mM Sodium Phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and a temperature of 55 degrees to 60 degrees Celsius are suitable. For example, in one embodiment, \u201cmoderately stringent conditions\u201d can be defined as hybridizations carried out as described above, followed by washing in 0.2\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 degrees Celsius (Ausubel et al., 1989, Current Protocols for Molecular Biology, ibid.).",
                        "More particularly, moderate stringency hybridization and washing conditions, as referred to herein, refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 70% nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction (i.e., conditions permitting about 30% or less mismatch of nucleotides). High stringency hybridization and washing conditions, as referred to herein, refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 80% nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction (i.e., conditions permitting about 20% or less mismatch of nucleotides). Very high stringency hybridization and washing conditions, as referred to herein, refer to conditions which permit isolation of nucleic acid molecules having at least about 90% nucleic acid sequence identity with the nucleic acid molecule being used to probe in the hybridization reaction (i.e., conditions permitting about 10% or less mismatch of nucleotides). As discussed above, one of skill in the art can use the formulae in Meinkoth et al., ibid. to calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to achieve these particular levels of nucleotide mismatch. Such conditions will vary, depending on whether DNA:RNA or DNA:DNA hybrids are being formed. Calculated melting temperatures for DNA:DNA hybrids are 10\u00b0 C. less than for DNA:RNA hybrids. In particular embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions for DNA:DNA hybrids include hybridization at an ionic strength of 6\u00d7SSC (0.9 M Na+) at a temperature of between about 20\u00b0 C. and about 35\u00b0 C. (low stringency), more preferably, between about 28\u00b0 C. and about 42\u00b0 C. (more stringent), and even more preferably, between about 35\u00b0 C. and about 45\u00b0 C. (even more stringent), with appropriate wash conditions. In particular embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions for DNA:RNA hybrids include hybridization at an ionic strength of 6\u00d7SSC (0.9 M Na+) at a temperature of between about 30\u00b0 C. and about 45\u00b0 C., more preferably, between about 38\u00b0 C. and about 50\u00b0 C., and even more preferably, between about 45\u00b0 C. and about 55\u00b0 C., with similarly stringent wash conditions. These values are based on calculations of a melting temperature for molecules larger than about 100 nucleotides, 0% formamide and a G+C content of about 40%. Alternatively, Tm can be calculated empirically as set forth in Sambrook et al., supra, pages 9.31 to 9.62. In general, the wash conditions should be as stringent as possible, and should be appropriate for the chosen hybridization conditions. For example, hybridization conditions can include a combination of salt and temperature conditions that are approximately 20-25\u00b0 C. below the calculated Tm of a particular hybrid, and wash conditions typically include a combination of salt and temperature conditions that are approximately 12-20\u00b0 C. below the calculated Tm of the particular hybrid. One example of hybridization conditions suitable for use with DNA:DNA hybrids includes a 2-24 hour hybridization in 6\u00d7SSC (50% formamide) at about 42\u00b0 C., followed by washing steps that include one or more washes at room temperature in about 2\u00d7SSC, followed by additional washes at higher temperatures and lower ionic strength (e.g., at least one wash as about 37\u00b0 C. in about 0.1\u00d7-0.5\u00d7SSC, followed by at least one wash at about 68\u00b0 C. in about 0.1\u00d7-0.5\u00d7SSC).",

It is noted that due to some differences in the standard parameters between BLAST 2.0 Basic BLAST and BLAST 2, two specific sequences might be recognized as having significant homology using the BLAST 2 program, whereas a search performed in BLAST 2.0 Basic BLAST using one of the sequences as the query sequence may not identify the second sequence in the top matches. In addition, PSI-BLAST provides an automated, easy-to-use version of a \u201cprofile\u201d search, which is a sensitive way to look for sequence homologues. The program first performs a gapped BLAST database search. The PSI-BLAST program uses the information from any significant alignments returned to construct a position-specific score matrix, which replaces the query sequence for the next round of database searching. Therefore, it is to be understood that percent identity can be determined by using any one of these programs.",

                                "In characterizing FA elongation in C. elegans, the inventors identified eight sequences homologous to the yeast long-chain FA elongation enzymes (Kniazeva, Sieber et al. 2003). To test for their possible functions in vivo, the inventors applied RNAi to the corresponding genes followed by an analysis of FA composition in whole animals using Gas Chromatography (GC). RNAi treatment of four genes\u2014elo-3 (D2024.3), elo-4 (C40H1.4), elo-7 (F56H11.3), and elo-8 (Y47D3A.30)\u2014did not produce any notable phenotypes, whereas suppression of elo-1 (F56H11.4) and elo-2 (F11E6.5), affected the elongation of straight long-chain saturated and polyunsaturated FA (Kniazeva, Sieber et al. 2003).",
                                "Surprisingly, the RNAi treatment of the two remaining genes, elo-5 (F41H10.7) and elo-6 (F41H10.8), affected the levels of branched-chain FA. Transcriptional reporter constructs (elo-5Prom::GFP and elo-6Prom::GFP) indicated that both genes are expressed in the gut (data not shown). In addition, elo-5 was expressed in unidentified head cells and elo-6 was expressed in neurons, pharynx, and vulva muscles.",
                                "The RNAi of elo-6 significantly reduced the amount of only C17ISO, while the RNAi of elo-5 dramatically reduced quantities of both C15ISO and C17ISO (FIGS. 2A and 2B; arrowheads point to the peaks corresponding to C15ISO and C17ISO). These results indicated that ELO-5 might be involved in the biosynthesis of C15ISO and possibly also C17ISO, whereas ELO-6 may function in elongating C15ISO to C17ISO (FIGS. 2C and 2D). FIG. 2C shows a comparison of fatty acid (FA) composition in three strains; wild type, elo-5(RNAi) and elo-6(RNAi). C17ISO is decreased in both RNAi strains, while C15ISO is only decreased in elo-5(RNAi). FIG. 2D shows the suggested elongation reactions catalyzed by ELO-5 and ELO-6 in the C15ISO and C17ISO biosynthesis. Fatty acids are elongated by an addition of two carbon groups at a time. These data suggest that ELO-6 acts at the elongation step from C15 to C17, whereas ELO-5 appears to be involved in the production of both C15ISO and C17ISO. To the best of the inventors' knowledge, these are the first enzymes that have been shown to be involved in the long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis in a non-bacterial in vivo system and the first enzymes of the long chain FA elongation family related to mmBCFA production.",
                                "In bacteria, the mmBCFA biosynthesis utilizes branched-chain \u03b1-keto-acids of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to produce mmBCFA acyl-CoA primers that substitute for acetyl-CoAs in the conventional FA biosynthesis (Oku and Kaneda 1988). Key enzymes engaged in synthesizing the mmBCFA acyl-CoA primers are branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) and the branched-chain \u03b1-keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex (FIG. 3A). The elongation of the mmBCFA backbone is then carried out by fatty acid synthetase (FAS). FIG. 3A shows the early steps of the mmBCFA biosynthesis in bacteria, based on (Oku and Kaneda 1988) (BCAT, branched-chain aminotransferase; BCKAD, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; FAS, fatty acid synthetase). The predicted corresponding C. elegans genes encoding predicted orthologs were identified (shown in italicized names of reading frames).",
                                "An ability of C. elegans to grow on the chemically defined axenic media CbMM, which lacks the potential mmBCFA precursors, has suggested that the animals can synthesize mmBCFA de novo. If so, a disruption of the BCKAD complex could affect mmBCFA levels. The inventors identified a predicted C. elegans protein, Y39E4A.3, with a significant sequence homology to E1 alpha subunit of BCKAD (Y39E4A.3 scores 8e-50 on 57% of the length with the Bacillus subtilis BCKAD, and 1.4-e134 on 88.4% of the length with the Homo sapience BCKADs). RNAi of Y39E4A.3 led to a significant decrease in C15ISO and C17ISO production (FIG. 3B; black arrowheads point to C15ISO and C17ISO and FIG. 3C; p-value is 0.001 and 0.008 for C15ISO and C17ISO, respectively). RNAi suppression of another predicted component of the BCKAD complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase (T05H0.6), resulted in a similar decrease in C15ISO and C17ISO (data not shown), indicating a role for the C. elegans BCKAD protein in long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis. Thus, C. elegans appears to use the same initial reactions to produce mmBCFA as bacterial cells. In addition, the worms use enzymes of the FA elongation family, ELO-5 and ELO-6 to complete the pathway.",
                                "A connection between BCKAD functions and mmBCFA quantities has been previously reported in humans (Jones, Peet et al. 1996). Normally hair fibers are densely covered with C21anteISO, which contributes about 38.2% to the total hair FAs (Jones and Rivett 1997). It was observed that patients with the Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which is caused by an inherited mutation in the BCKAD gene, had a drastically reduced level of mmBCFA in their hair. Together, these data suggest that the long-chain mmBCFA biosynthesis could be similar in bacteria, C. elegans, and human.",

Worms originating from wild type eggs laid on the elo-5(RNAi) plates displayed no obvious growth or morphological abnormality until the second day of adulthood when they developed an egg-laying defect (data not shown). Eggs of the next generation hatched on time but the progeny arrested at the first of the four larval stages (L1). The small larvae maintained morphological integrity and could survive on a plate for up to 3-4 days. The arrest was only observed in progeny of parents exposed to elo-5 RNAi at the L1 stage.",
                                "When parental animals were subjected to elo-5 RNAi at later larval stages (L2-L4), their progeny did not arrest in L1 but continued to develop into adulthood. These animals had no obvious defects in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, intestinal contractions, chemotaxis response, touch sensitivity or general anatomy (data not shown). However, the growing worms became progressively sick (data not shown). The gonads appeared normal at the L4 and early adult stages, but after fertilization of 1-10 oocytes, oogenesis became impaired. Gonad degeneration began with a pronounced vacuolization in the mid-section of the gonad followed by the appearance of disorganized clumps of nuclei in the proximal part. An egg-laying defect became apparent and only a few progeny arose from these worms, which then arrested at L1. The development of the elo-5 RNAi phenotypes is likely due to a gradual elimination of the ELO-5-associated functions. These data suggest that these functions are crucial for larval growth and development.",
                                "The inventors also obtained a likely null mutant of the elo-5 gene, elo-5(gk208) that has a 245 bp deletion eliminating the predicted first exon (Genome Science Center, BC Cancer Research Center, Vancouver). This allele phenocopies the L1 arrest phenotype of the elo-5(RNAi) animals.",

                                "The inventors reasoned that if the defects observed in the elo-5(RNAi) animals resulted directly from the deficiency of C15ISO and C17ISO, then feeding these worms with C15ISO and C17ISO should mask a shortage of endogenous C15/C17ISO and permit the animals to grow normally. As predicted, the C17ISO as well as C17anteISO supplements rescued the elo-5 RNAi defects (52/60 and 58/60 plates correspondingly). A partial rescue was observed on the plates supplemented with C15ISO and C15anteISO (23/38 and 20/28 plates correspondingly). Corroborating results were obtained when homozygous elo-5(gk208) animals were supplied with C17ISO grew normally. In sharp contrast, neither saturated, mono- or poly-unsaturated FA molecules (C16:0, C16:1 n7, C17:0, C18:3 n6) nor mmBCFA with shorter or longer backbones (C13ISO, C18ISO, C19ISO), nor poly-methyl branched phytanic acid were able to rescue or reduce defects (0/30 plates in each experiment). Therefore, the inventors have determined that only dietary 17-carbon mmBCFA are competent to bypass the biochemical defect caused by loss of ELO-5 function.",
                                "GC analysis of FA composition in worms grown on supplemented plates revealed that only C17ISO and C17anteISO are significantly incorporated into lipids (FIGS. 4A-4C). FIG. 4A shows that animals grown with C15ISO supplements were partially rescued to wild type phenotype; however, no accumulation of C15ISO or its elongation to C17ISO was detectable. FIGS. 4B and 4C show that animals grown with the C17ISO (FIG. 4B) and or C17anteISO (FIG. 4C) supplements were fully rescued (peaks corresponding to C71ISO and C17anteISO are prominent). Because the addition of C15ISO did not result in elongation to C17ISO (FIG. 4A), the inventors wanted to determine whether ELO-6 was capable of extending an FA backbone in the absence of ELO-5, or whether the supplied free mmBCFA molecules could enter a different metabolic pathway, for instance, a degradation pathway. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the inventors added mmBCFA-producing bacteria on top of the regular RNAi feeding E. coli strain (HT115) that lacks mmBCFA. This mmBCFA-producing strain was identified by chance; the inventors noticed that in the presence of a certain bacterial contaminant the animals could overcome the elo-5(RNAi) effects. Using a rapid bacterial identification method, the inventors determined the contaminant to be Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. GC analysis revealed that this bacterial strain produced a high quantity of C15ISO and C15anteISO but not 17-carbon mmBCFA (FIG. 4D; arrowheads point to major FA, C15ISO and C15anteISO). GC analysis of elo-5(RNAi) animals fed with S. maltophilia indicated that they not only accumulated bacterial C15ISO and C15anteISO but also efficiently elongated these FA species to C17ISO and C17anteISO that are absent in S. maltophilia (FIGS. 4D and 4E; arrowheads indicate mmBCFA, and arrow illustrates the elongation from C15 to C17 mmBCFA). This suggested that elongation from C15ISO to C17ISO mmBCFA is not impaired in the elo-5(RNAi) animals. Therefore, ELO-6 function remains intact in elo-5(RNAi). Apparently, C15ISO added to the plates could not be utilized by ELO-6 whereas C15ISO-CoA and/or C15anteISO-CoA originating from the bacterial food could, suggesting that free and esterified mmBCFA were likely to enter alternative pathways.",
                                "The essential roles of C15/C17ISO were also supported through an examination of the elo-5(gk208) deletion mutant. The homozygous mutants grew without any obvious morphological defects when maintained on the plates supplemented with C17ISO or seeded with S. maltophilia. However, removal of the mmBCFA supplements or S. maltophilia by bleaching resulted in the same L1 arrest phenotype as the elo-5(RNAi) worms.",
                                "L1 Arrest of the elo-5(RNAi) Animals is Reversible and Related to the Variations in Levels of C17ISO During Development",
                                "The inventors then asked if elo-5(RNAi) animals arrested at L1 stage could be recovered by adding the 17-carbon mmBCFA supplements. Indeed, C17ISO and C17anteISO could effectively release L1 larvae from the developmental arrest; about 50% of two day-arrested and 1% of four-day-old L1 were rescued to full growth and proliferation. Since C17anteISO could not be detected in the laboratory animals under normal conditions of culturing, C17ISO appeared to be the principal molecule conveying the ELO-5 function. Therefore, the L1-arrest of the C17ISO-depleted worms is both completely penetrant and reversible, indicating that C17ISO plays a critical role in growth and development at the L1 stage.",
                                "The analysis of the FA levels of staged worms revealed that the C17ISO level increases gradually from a relatively low level at L1 to its peak in gravid adults containing eggs (FIG. 5A). Specifically, FIG. 5A shows the relative amounts of C15ISO and C17ISO in the worm samples collected in different developmental stages. The amount of the mmBCFA molecule is presented as the percentage of total FA in each sample. Based on the analysis of GFP reporter constructs (data not shown) and in situ hybridization data (results from NextDB by Y. Kohara, Tokyo), neither elo-5 nor elo-6 are significantly expressed in eggs or L1. Therefore, C17ISO likely accumulates in embryos during oogenesis. It may be directly transported from gut to gonads since both ELO-5 and ELO-6 were expressed mainly in the gut and because feeding C17ISO rescued the elo-5 mutant phenotypes. When RNAi-mediated disruption of elo-5 occurs at the L1 stage of a parent and consequently blocks C17ISO synthesis from that stage on, the eggs and L1 animals of the next generation are expected to contain a critically low concentration of C17ISO, halting further development. Because the arrested L1 can be rescued by a dietary supply of the mmBCFA, the deficiency is not likely to cause critical defects during embryonic and early postembryonic periods.",
                                "If elo-5 RNAi is applied to the parent worms at or after the L2 larval stage, when the amount of C17ISO has already been elevated and/or the RNAi-effect is less penetrant, the progeny may receive sufficient C17ISO to pass the L1 arrest stage. The resulting animals, however, become visibly unhealthy at L4 and adult stages as mentioned earlier, suggesting that C17ISO also plays a role in late developmental stages.",
                                "Based on these results, the inventors propose a relationship between the amounts of C17ISO and developmental stages (FIG. 5B). As shown in FIG. 5B, depending on the time of RNAi onset, the amount of C17ISO in F1 eggs varies. If elo-5 is suppressed in parental animals after they have begun to synthesize mmBCFA, then their eggs will have a reduced C17ISO level that is still above the critical low level which permits these animals to grow but display gonadal defects. These worms produce a small number of progeny that is then arrested in L1. If parental animals are treated with elo-5(RNAi) right after hatching, they are unable to initiate the mmBCFA biosynthesis and the levels of C15ISO and C17ISO in their eggs are reduced to below the critical low level, resulting in L1 arrest of their progeny. In this model, the level of C71ISO is monitored at the first larval stage and the decision is made whether to proceed or pause in development. The analysis of GC data from staged animals has also indicated that the variation of C17ISO level is correlated with only two other FA species, suggesting a potential compensatory and co-regulation mechanism.",

                                "FA homeostasis implies that relative amounts of various FA species are coordinated and balanced for optimal performance. To obtain information that may reveal why and how numerous FAs and their specific metabolic enzymes are maintained in nature, the inventors carried out analysis to determine a possible correlation between changes in the levels of C17ISO and other FA detected in worms. The inventors have analyzed a large amount of GC data (n=50) obtained from mixed populations of wild type animals where the fractions of eggs, larvae, and adults randomly varied. The GC data was separately obtained from staged worms was included: eggs, L1, L2, L3, L4, and gravid adults. The inventors found that the amounts of C17ISO significantly correlated with only two other FA molecules: linoleic, C18:2 n6, and vaccenic, C18:1n7 (FIG. 6). The graphical illustrations in FIG. 6 were obtained by GC analysis of synchronized populations of worms. Changes in relative amounts of FA are emphasized with treadlines created in Microsoft Excel. Combined with the GC measurements generated from additional 50 samples (material and methods), these data were used to calculate correlation coefficients (CORRELC17ISO/C18:2n6=+0.82772, T-TEST=6.54814E-07 and CORRELC17ISO/C18:1 n7=\u22120.85162, T-TEST=4.74094E-05). A potential physiological significance of these correlations is intriguing.",
                                "The observed negative correlation between the levels of C17ISO and C18:1 n7 throughout development may indicate a compensatory adjustment important for physiological functions, such as retention of the cell membrane physical properties. mmBCFA and monounsaturated straight-chain FA have been previously implicated in regulating membrane fluidity, which depends on the ratio of saturated FA to monounsaturated and branched-chain FA content in bacterial cells. An elevation in monounsaturated FA amounts in response to the decrease of BCFA but not vise versa was observed in Streptomyces avermitilis, suggesting that monounsaturated FA may sense a state of membrane fluidity.",
                                "In the elo-5(RNAi) treated worms, a substantial loss of C15/C17ISO is also accompanied by a change in the FA composition, most noticeably by the elevation in C18:1n7 (FIG. 2C), a result consistent with the above observation. To estimate the effect of the C15/C17ISO deficiency on the membrane saturation, the saturation index (SI=[saturated FA]/[mmBCFA+monounsaturated FA]) was calculated. No significant differences were detected in elo-5(RNAi) worm compared to wild type (SI=0.325\u00b10.011, n=6 and SI=0.320\u00b10.032, n=5 respectively). Therefore, elo-5(RNAi) may not cause a massive cell membrane dysfunction.",
                                "A positive correlation between the amounts of C17ISO and that of C18:2 n6 may suggest a potential common function during development. In addition to the importance of linoleic acid as a substrate for PUFA biosynthesis, its hydroxylated fatty acid derivative (HODEs) is known as a signaling molecule affecting chemotaxis, cell proliferation, and modulation of several enzymatic pathways. A correlation between C17ISO and linoleic acid may also suggest a similar regulation of biosynthesis of the two molecules.",
                                "The changes in the FA composition associated with a decrease in C15/C17ISO indicate that the metabolism of straight-chain FA species is responsive to the mmBCFA levels and suggest a cross regulation. Interestingly, in the elo-5(RNAi) animals fed with the C15ISO/C15anteISO containing bacterial supplement (S. maltophilia), the FA composition is significantly altered (FIG. 4E). It appears that mmBCFA become principal components in a range of 16-18 carbon FAs. This suggests that large quantities of mmBCFA are not toxic. In contrast, because these worms grow and proliferate well, mmBCFA seem to be efficient substitutes for saturated and monounsaturated straight-chain FAs.",

                                "In mammals, straight-chain FA biosynthesis depends on the 1c-isoform of sterol regulatory element binding protein, SREBP-1c, which promotes the expression of FA metabolic enzymes. There is only one protein in C. elegans that is homologous to mammalian SREBPs, Y47D3B.7 (the gene has been named lpd-1 for LiPid Depleted 1) (McKay, McKay et al. 2003). McKay and co-authors have shown that worms treated with lpd-1 RNAi display lipid-depleted phenotype. They have also shown that lpd-1 regulates the expression of several lipogenic enzymes, Acetyl-CoA Carboxilase (ACC), Fatty Acid synthetase (FAS) and Glycerol 3-Phosphate Acyltransferase (G3PA) (McKay, McKay et al. 2003). Thus, similar to its mammalian homolog, lpd-1 is involved in straight-chain FA biosynthesis.",
                                "The inventors wanted to see if lpd-1 also plays a role in mmBCFA metabolism. RNAi was first applied to lpd-1 and the FA composition of the mutant worms was determined. As expected, the FA content of treated animals was significantly changed, but surprisingly the most reduced were the levels of C15ISO and C17ISO (FIGS. 7A-7C). Also significantly reduced was the amount of C18:2 n6. In contrast, the C16:0 level was elevated. FIGS. 7A and 7B show the GC profiles of wild type and lpd-1(RNAi)-treated worms, respectively. FIG. 7C shows a summary of several independent GC runs (bars represent the percentages of total FAs). The results show that the levels of C15ISO, C17ISO, and C16:0 are significantly altered by the RNAi treatment (black arrowheads point to differences in the C15ISO and C17ISO amounts. Grey arrowhead indicates the changes in palmitic acid, C16:0). These data indicated that, in addition to regulating the first steps of global FA biosynthesis through the activation of the ACC and FAS transcription, the worm SREBP homolog regulates mmBCFA elongation as well as desaturation of straight-chain FA.",
                                "As reported previously, disruption of lpd-1 through a mutation or RNAi injection caused early larval arrest (McKay, McKay et al. 2003). The effect of lpd-1 RNAi feeding in the inventors' experiments was apparently less severe. The RNAi-treated animals displayed slow growth, morphological abnormalities, and egg-laying defects but no larval arrest. Supplementing C17ISO to the plates did not significantly rescue these defects.",

McKay and co-authors have shown that the lpd-2(RNAi) and lpd-1(RNAi) phenotypes are quite similar; affected worms are defective in growth, pale and scrawny in appearance and in lack of fat content (McKay, McKay et al. 2003). They have also shown that LPD-1 and LPD-2 control the expression of the same lipogenic enzymes: ACC, FAS, ASL, and G3PA. The inventors tested to see if LPD-1 and LPD-2 function similarly in the regulation of mmBCFA biosynthesis. In contrast to the result from lpd-1(RNAi), the FA composition in lpd-2(RNAi) worms was not significantly different from that of wild type animals even though these animals had a noticeably sick appearance (data not shown). This result suggested that, in addition to having some common targets, LPD-1 and LPD-2 have distinct functions. LPD-1 is important for production of mmBCFA as well as other very long-chain FA, whereas LPD-2 has no specificity for any particular type of FA.",

The genes encoding mammalian orthologs of the C. elegans elo-2 and \u03949-desaturase genes are known targets of SREBP-1c. To examine if elo-5 and elo-6 are targets of lpd-1, the inventors analyzed the expression of elo-5, elo-6, and lpd-1.",
                                "Evaluation of the expression from a lpd-1Prom::GFP fusion construct (a gift of J Graff) in transgenic animals revealed that, in addition to the previously reported expression in intestinal cells (McKay, McKay et al. 2003), the construct is strongly expressed in a subset of head neurons (data not shown). Using a lipophilic dye, DiI, which highlights chemosensory ciliated neurons, we identified these neurons as amphids. In the strains carrying elo-5Prom::GFP and elo-6Prom::GFP reporter constructs, GFP fluorescence was also detected in the gut and several head neurons including amphid neurons (data not shown).",
                                "If LPD-1 promotes elo-5 and elo-6 expression, then RNAi of lpd-1 should alter GFP intensity in elo-5Prom::GFP and elo-6Prom::GFP reporter strains. The level of GFP expression driven by elo-5 and elo-6 promoters is high in conventionally cultured animals. In the worms maintained on the lpd-1(RNAi) plates, the expression was noticeably weakened, suggesting a down-regulation of the promoter activities (data not shown). No significant changes in the GFP expression were detected in a control strain containing a kqt-1Prom::GFP construct that also expresses GFP in head neurons and the gut (unpublished).",
                                "To test if the disruption of FAS, a target of LPD-1 (McKay, McKay et al. 2003), could contribute to the observed decrease of C15/C17ISO in lpd-1(RNAi), the inventors analyzed FA composition in FAS(RNAi) strains. There is one predicted FAS gene, F32H2.5, and its shorter homolog, F32H2.6 in the C. elegans genome. The latter can only encode the N-terminal portion of the protein. These genes share extended nucleotide identity and RNAi of one could thus possibly affect the other. Consistent with a critical role for FAS in the first steps of FA biosynthesis, the RNAi-mediated disruption of F32H2.5 and F32H2.6 resulted in multiple defects and a lethal growth arrest (data not shown). The FA composition (the content and relative amounts of various FA species) of the affected animals remained, however, unchanged. This suggested that disruption of FAS does not selectively alter FA biosynthesis and that neither FAS protein is specific for mmBCFA. Therefore, down-regulation of FAS by loss of lpd-1 cannot account for the severe deficiency of mmBCFA in lpd-1(RNAi).",
                                "Thus, the inventors showed that disruption of lpd-1 affects C15ISO/C17ISO biosynthesis. The fact that lpd-1, elo-5 and elo-6 are expressed in the same cells concurrently and that the GFP reporter analysis indicated that elo-5 and elo-6 transcription is down regulated in the absence of lpd-1 suggests that elo-5 and elo-6 are likely to be the targets of lpd-1.",
                                "Since ACC and FAS catalyze the first steps in the biosynthesis of straight-chain FAs while ELO-5 and ELO-6 extend mmBCFA molecules, LPD-1 appears to integrate conventional and \u201cunusual\u201d FA biosyntheses. It seems reasonable to predict that in order to differentiate between these metabolic pathways and mediate compensatory or adaptive changes in FA composition, LPD-1 must interact with other factors such as nuclear receptors activated by specific FA ligands. It is thus important to screen for such interactions to better understand the FA homeostasis in C. elegans.",

                                "Because mammalian SREBP-1c regulates PUFA biosynthesis and is feedback-inhibited by PUFAs, the inventors asked if lpd-1 could be regulated by mmBCFA at the transcriptional level. The microarray data (discussed below) indicated a 1.68 fold up-regulation of lpd-1 in the elo-5(RNAi) animals, while no changes were detected in its levels between samples from wild type animals at different developmental stages (see Materials and Methods above).",
                                "To examine the influence of the mmBCFA deficiency on lpd-1 expression, the inventors grew the lpd-1Prom::GFP containing strain on the elo-5(RNAi) and control plates to compare GFP fluorescence. No obvious difference in the GFP expression driven by the lpd-1 promoter in intestinal cells was detected on the elo-5(RNAi) plates versus the control plates. A modest change in the transcription level (1.68 fold) could be masked by a variability of the expression between individual animals and even between individual cells (not shown). In contrast to the observation in the intestinal cells, a strong induction of GFP was detected in amphid neurons of lpd-1Prom::GFP; elo-5(RNAi) animals (data not shown). This suggested that a chronic deficiency of mmBCFA in elo-5(RNAi) animals may transcriptionally stimulate LPD-1 production at least in neuronal cells.",
                                "Collectively, the inventors' results suggest that the relationship between lpd-1 and C15/C17ISO is reciprocal; while down-regulation of lpd-1 transcription results in the C17ISO deficiency, the C15/C17ISO deficiency up-regulates lpd-1 transcription at least in a subset of cells. Therefore, the worm SREBP homolog, LPD-1, may play an important role in mmBCFA homeostasis.",

Regulation of mmBCFA homeostasis may involve transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, as well as transport and binding proteins. It is reasonable to suggest that a deficiency of mmBCFA triggers a compensatory alteration in the expression of these genes. It is also feasible that a comparative analysis of global gene expressions between wild type and mmBCFA deficient animals may reveal these potential changes and the changes underlying developmental and growth functions of mmBCFA.",
                                "The inventors used DNA microarray analysis to compare the total gene expression in elo-5(RNAi) and wild type animals. To select candidate genes, restrictive criteria were applied and genes were excluded of which the expression was also changed in the spt-1(RNAi) strain (Materials & Methods). The spt-1(C23H3.4) gene encodes a predicted C. elegans homolog of serine-palmitoyl transferase subunit 1. RNAi of spt-1 strongly affects the FA composition without reducing the C15/C17ISO levels (data not shown). The F1 generation of spt-1(RNAi) animals developed gonadal and egg-laying defects that are similar to the phenotype of F1 animals from parents treated with elo-5(RNAi) at a late larval stage (described earlier) (data not shown). The inventors thought that by deselecting genes that have altered expressions in spt-1(RNAi), they would be able to eliminate variations in gene expressions unrelated to the mmBCFA deficiency. Such variations might emerge from altered straight-chain FA metabolism and from general sickness. Here, the analysis of the first set of candidate genes that are differentially expressed in elo-5(RNAi) and may relate to the C15/C17ISO homeostasis are discussed.",
                                "Twenty-five genes were selected in the screen (Table 1) and each was functionally tested by RNAi and GC analysis for its role in C15/C17ISO metabolism. RNAi of four of these genes (pnk-1 (C10G11.5), nhr-49 (K10C3.6), acs-1 (F46E10.1), and C27H6.2) significantly affected the FA composition (FIGS. 8A-8E). All four genes encoded products structurally homologous to the known proteins (PNK-1, human pantothenate kinase; NHR-49, nuclear hormone receptor; ACS-1, very long-chain FA CoA ligase; and C27H6.2, RuvB-like DNA binding protein). Specifically, FIG. 8A shows the GC profile of wild type, and FIGS. 8B-8E show the GC profiles of the RNAi-treated worms. In FIGS. 8B-8D, RNAi of the three genes resulted in a decrease of the C17ISO or both C15ISO and C17ISO levels indicated by black arrowheads. In addition, a significant elevation in straight-chain saturated FA indicated by gray arrowheads is observed in K10C3.6(RNAi). FIG. 8E shows that C27H6.2(RNAi) does not cause significant changes in mmBCFA but results in an elevation of straight-chain monounsaturated FA, C18:1 n7, indicated by white arrowheads. Statistical analysis of several GC runs on each of the sample was also carried out (data not shown).",

                                "Circumstantial evidence suggests that these four candidate genes may be involved in feedback regulation of mmBCFA biosynthesis. First, the expression of these genes is not variable in nature as judged by a comparison of the microarray data obtained from developmentally different populations of N2 (Materials & Methods) as well as for vulval development pathway mutants (data obtained for an unrelated project, J. Chen, personal communication). Secondly, the direction of the changes for three of the genes is in concordance with the proposed feedback regulation; pnk-1, nhr-49, and acs-1 were up-regulated in C17ISO deficient elo-5(RNAi). Lastly, a functional analysis shows that these three candidate genes are required for the normal level of mmBCFA production (RNAi of the genes affects the mmBCFA production). The forth candidate gene, C27H6.2, affects the level of vaccenic acid (C18:1 n7), which is related to the levels of mmBCFA (FIGS. 8A-8E), suggesting cross talk between fatty acid biosynthesis pathways.",
                                "To detect a potential feedback regulation involving acs-1 and pnk-1, the inventors made reporter strains with GFP expression driven by acs-1 and pnk-1 promoters, acs-1Prom::GFP and pnk-1Prom::GFP, respectively. These two genes showed a higher degree of up-regulation than the other candidates according to the microarray data. In addition, RNAi of these two genes resulted in a significant loss in the mmBCFA fraction. The GFP fluorescence from acs-1Prom::GFP and pnk-1Prom::GFP was readily detectable in the gut. Expression of acs-1Prom::GFP was also detected in the canal-associated neurons (CAN) in the head neurons and vulval cells. A comparison of synchronized animals grown on the control and elo-5(RNAi) plates indicated a significantly brighter fluorescence in the RNAi worms (data not shown) suggesting up-regulation of acs-1 and pnk-1 under C15ISO/C17ISO deficiency. These results were in concordance with the microarray data. Moreover, pnk-1, but not acs-1 seemed to be regulated by LPD-1 because pnk-1Prom::GFP expression was significantly reduced on lpd-1(RNAi) (data not shown).",
                                "It was interesting to note that the pnk-1 and acs-1 genes were previously selected in two different screens as potential targets of the daf-2/daf-16 (Y55D5A.5 and R13H8.1 correspondingly) pathway. pnk-1 had been identified in a screen for genes affecting C. elegans life-span and metabolism through analysis of promoter regions and it was confirmed as a direct target of DAF-16, a forkhead transcriptional factor. acs-1 had been identified in a microarray screen for DAF-16 targets that influence the life-span. A third gene, nhr-49, had been previously selected in a screen for fat regulatory genes. It was shown that RNAi of this gene leads to an increase in fat accumulation in affected animals. The inventors' analysis of nhr-49(RNAi) animals showed that reduction of the nhr-49 activity results in up-regulation of saturated FA biosynthesis that may contribute to fat accumulation. Although the regulatory path for this process remains unknown, the involvement of daf-2 has not been ruled out.",
                                "A potential link of the candidate genes to DAF-2/insulin signaling is very intriguing. The C. elegans insulin-signaling pathway is involved in sensing nutritional state and metabolic conditions as well as controlling growth and diapause. A described herein, a mmBCFA deficiency causes transient L1 arrest. This phenotype strikingly resembles L1 arrest of worms hatched in the absence of food (a method commonly used to obtain synchronized animals). An investigation of possible roles for mmBCFA in food sensation and insulin signaling pathways is underway (see Examples below).",

This is consistent with the enlarged fraction of monounsaturated FAs observed in the elo-5(RNAi) animals (FIG. 3C). Down-regulation of C27H6.2 may have an adaptive effect to compensate for the loss of mmBCFA in cell membranes. If so, C27H6.2 may be a part of mechanism that senses and tunes physical properties of membranes. C27H6.2 is homologous to an evolutionary conserved protein RuvB/TIP49a/Pontin52 essential for growth and proliferation. Its mammalian ortholog acts as a transcriptional cofactor that binds to \u03b2-catenin, TATA-box binding protein, and likely to a number of other diverse transcription factors.",

A deficiency of these FA is lethal and cannot be compensated by any other FA present, indicating their crucial importance for growth and development. There are two sources of C15ISO/C17ISO available for worms. First they possess a system for mmBCFA biosynthesis that includes two FA elongation enzymes, ELO-5 and ELO-6, which are regulated at least in part by the nematode homolog of SREBP-1c (lpd-1). Second, worms may obtain mmBCFA from their diet (bacteria). Therefore, C. elegans is able to produce, activate, transport, and utilize mmBCFA and is vitally dependent on this system.",
                                "The level of C15/C17ISO in eggs appears to be critical for growth and development as animals depleted of C15/C17ISO completely arrest at the L1 stage. The uniformity and reversibility of the arrest would be consistent with a regulatory role for these mmBCFA or more complex lipid molecules containing them on growth and development. However, it cannot be ruled out that the arrest is due to the failure of a metabolic or structural function that is essential for growth and development at the first larval stage. In addition, C15/C17ISO may directly or indirectly regulate genes involved in FA homeostasis. Consistent with this, their deficiency triggers a large alteration in gene expression that may reflect a complex feedback mechanism. Among the potentially responsive genes are transcription factors and metabolic genes.",

The inventors have demonstrated that suppression of acs-1 does not affect cell cycle but causes a failure in cellularization resulting in multinucleated blasotmers polyploidy) and eventually in embryonic lethality (data not shown). This defect may take place as early as at the first cell division. It does not affect polarity and polar body extrusion. This phenotype is doze-dependent; the weaker suppression the more full cell cycles with proper cellularization occur and the more embryos escape lethality.",
                                "The embryonic lethality caused by suppression of acs-1 can be partially rescued by temperature sensitive allele of zen-4 encoding homolog of mammalian kinesin-like protein-1. During cell divisions in the C. elegans embryo ZEN-4 is localized to the cleavage furrow (Severson et al., 2000). A suppression of zen-4, itself, results in embryonic phenotype similar to the one observed under the acs-1 suppression (Severson et al., 2000). In the inventors' model, ZEN-4 binds directly or indirectly to the product of the ACS-1 enzymatic activity that may be situated on the cell membrane. Each one is necessary to complete the cleavage. Conceivably, the temperature sensitive allele of zen-4 may bind to cell membrane in the acs-1 independent manner and therefore overcome the acs-1-associated embryonic lethality."

In these embryos the inner layer of eggshell is absent (data not shown). In contrast this layer is doubled in pod-1 mutants that are also sensitive to low salt concentration (Rappleye et al., 1999). This suggests that the dark inner layer is not responsible for osmotic resistance. Unlike acs-1(RNAi)+C13ISO, the pod-1 embryos do not explode in hypotonic environment but expand in volume inside an intact eggs (Rappleye et al., 1999). This indicates that the inner dark layer might be responsible for mechanical durability of an eggshell.",

Electron microscopy reveals a prominent defect in the cuticle architecture (data not shown). Since a structure of the collagen-19 fibers comprising the affected cortical layer of the cuticle seems to be normal, highlighting annuli and furrows as in wild type (col-19::GFP expression data, not shown), the problem may lay in the supporting structure that when absent may cause a collapse of the annuli (FIGS. 9A and 9B). FIGS. 9A and 9B show the abnormal architecture of the adult's cuticle in acs-1(RNAi)+C31ISO. Specifically, FIG. 9A shows an electron micrograph of a wild type adult cuticle (the annuli and furrows are indicated by arrows). FIG. 9B shows an image of the adult acs-1(RNAi)+C13ISO cuticle which is dramatically different."
