# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Malaria, one of the world's most important infectious diseases, is transmitted by mosquitoes and is caused by four species of Plasmodium parasites (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae). Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and jaundice. Convulsions, coma, severe anemia and kidney failure can also occur. It remains a leading cause of death globally, especially amongst African children under 5 years of age. While repeated infections over many years leads to partial immunity in endemic areas, these adults still suffer significant morbidity and loss of productivity. The annual economic loss in Africa due to malaria is estimated at US $12 billion.

There is no effective vaccine currently available for malaria. Treatment has therefore relied primarily on antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine. Because some malaria parasites have acquired resistance to each available antimalarial drug, there is a desire to discover and develop new antimalarials.

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and use for preventing or treating malaria in animals including humans. The compounds of the invention are represented by formulas I, IV, and V. The compounds of the invention in combination with themselves or with other compounds exhibit synergic killing of parasites.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

During its approximately 48 h cycle within the human red blood cell (RBC), P. falciparum must increase the red blood cell's (RBC's) permeability to a broad range of solutes. Electrophysiological studies identified the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) as the molecular mechanism of these changes. PSAC's functional properties differ from those of known human ion channels. These properties include atypical gating, unique pharmacology, and an unmatched selectivity profile. An unusual property is PSAC's ability to exclude Na+ by more than 100,000-fold relative to Cl− despite the channel's broad permeability to anions and bulky nutrients. This level of exclusion of a single small solute has not been reported in other broadly selective channels; it is essential for parasite survival because a higher Na+ permeability would produce osmotic lysis of infected RBCs in the high Na+ serum.

PSAC plays a central role in parasite nutrient acquisition. Sugars, amino acids, purines, vitamins, and precursors for phospholipid biosynthesis have markedly increased uptake into infected RBCs via PSAC. Many of these solutes have negligible permeability in uninfected RBCs and must be provided exogenously to sustain in vitro parasite growth. PSAC is conserved on divergent plasmodial species, as determined through studies of erythrocytes infected with rodent, avian, and primate malaria parasites. The channel's gating, voltage dependence, selectivity, and pharmacology are all conserved, suggesting that PSAC is a highly constrained integral membrane protein. Its surface location on the erythrocyte membrane offers conceptual advantages over parasite targets buried inside the infected RBC. PSAC's exposed location on infected RBCs forces direct access to antagonists in serum and excludes resistance via drug extrusion. In contrast, drugs acting within the parasite compartment must cross at least three membranous barriers to reach their target; clinical resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine appear to be linked to extrusion from their sites of action. Nearly all available PSAC antagonists inhibit in vitro parasite growth at concentrations modestly higher than those required for channel inhibition.

Accordingly, the invention provides, in an embodiment, a method of preventing malaria or treating an animal afflicted with malaria comprising administering to the animal, preferably a human:

The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, or diluents, are well known to those who are skilled in the art and are readily available to the public. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one which is chemically inert to the active compounds and one which has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.

The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular active agent, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The following formulations for oral, aerosol, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, interperitoneal, intrathecal, rectal, and vaginal administration are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.

Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying agent. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and cornstarch.

Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia, emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art.

The compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. They also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The compound can be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, glycerol ketals, such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or glyceride, or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.

Oils, which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils include peanut, soybean, sesame, cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters. Suitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, and alkyl pyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylene-polypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl-beta-aminopropionates, and 2-alkyl-imidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (3) mixtures thereof.

The parenteral formulations will typically contain from about 0.5 to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Suitable preservatives and buffers can be used in such formulations. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations ranges from about 5 to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.

The compounds of the present invention may be made into injectable formulations. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for injectable compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986).

Additionally, the compounds of the present invention may be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases, such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Suitable carriers and their formulations are further described in A. R. Gennaro, ed., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (19th ed.), Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1995).

The compound of the invention or a composition thereof can potentially be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition, base neutralized or addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or by reaction with an inorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and organic bases, such as mono-, di-, trialkyl, and aryl amines and substituted ethanolamines. The conversion to a salt is accomplished by treatment of the base compound with at least a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid. Typically, the free base is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol, methanol, and the like, and the acid is added in a similar solvent. The mixture is maintained at a suitable temperature (e.g., between 0° C. and 50° C.). The resulting salt precipitates spontaneously or can be brought out of solution with a less polar solvent.

The neutral forms of the compounds can be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.

The amount or dose of a compound of the invention or a salt thereof, or a composition thereof should be sufficient to affect a therapeutic or prophylactic response in the mammal. The appropriate dose will depend upon several factors. For instance, the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound or salt. Ultimately, the attending physician will decide the dosage of the compound of the present invention with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, compound or salt to be administered, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being treated. Typical doses might be, for example, 0.1 mg to 1 g daily, such as 5 mg to 500 mg daily.

The following example further illustrates the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.

### EXAMPLE 1

This example demonstrates the methodology employed to identify PSAC antagonists and characterize their interactions with PSAC. Methodologies include, but are not limited to, high-throughput screening of antagonists, electrophysiology, and in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays.

A high-throughput screen for antagonists of the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) was developed. This screen is based on a quantitative light scattering assay for PSAC activity (Wagner et al., Biophys. J. 84:116 (2003)). This light scattering assay measures changes in turbidity resulting from osmotic swelling and lysis of P. falciparum-infected cells in solutes with high permeability through PSAC, but negligible permeability in uninfected erythrocytes.

Synchronous in vitro cultures of P. falciparum (Indo 1 isolate) were harvested at the mature trophozoite stage and enriched to >95% parasitemia by percoll-sorbitol density gradient centrifugation. Cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5). The cell suspension was then dispensed into 384-, 1536-, or 3456-well plates. Individual compounds (DMSO stock solutions) were pinned from random small molecule libraries into each well. Osmotic lysis was initiated by addition of 280 mM sorbitol, 20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4 to at least four times the volume of the original cell suspension. In plate positive and negative controls were phosphate buffer with 2 mM furosemide and sorbitol with no compound, respectively. Transmittance readings were performed at timed intervals at 700-750 nm, based on the plate format. Hematocrit, total volume, final compound and DMSO concentrations, and time to each reading were optimized, yielding Z′ statistics greater than 0.7, where a perfect noise-free assay had a Z′ of 1.0 (Zhang et al., J. Biomol. Screen. 4:67 (1999)). Timed readings in this endpoint assay permitted accurate estimation of antagonist affinity in a high-throughput format. Re-test rates for hits were generally >95%.

The identified PSAC antagonists were confirmed and mechanism of action determined with cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. These were obtained as described in (Alkhalil et al., Blood 104:4279 (2004)) using symmetric bath and pipette solutions of 1,000 mM choline-Cl, 115 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. This hypertonic solution increased the signal-to-noise ratio for single PSAC detection by permitting higher rates of Cl− flux through open channels and by reducing electrical noise from the pipette. Recordings used quartz pipettes pulled to tip diameters <0.5 μm and resistances of 1-3 MΩ in the recording solution. Seal resistances were >100 GΩ. Antagonists were added to either bath or pipette compartments to determine mechanism of PSAC inhibition, whether the agent inhibits from the intracellular or extracellular face, and stoichiometry of interaction with PSAC. All recordings were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz (8-pole Bessel) and digitized at 100 kHz. All-points histograms and other analyses were carried out with home-written code.

Parasite killing by identified PSAC antagonists was evaluated using a SYBR Green I-based fluorescence assay for parasite nucleic acid in 96-well format. Synchronous parasite cultures were seeded at 0.2-0.5% parasitemia and 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2-10% serum, 50 mg/L hypoxanthine, and PSAC antagonists at selected concentrations. Cultures were maintained for 3 days at 37 ° C. in 5% O2, 5% CO2. The plates were then subjected to freeze-thaw before addition of SYBR Green I at twice the manufacturer's recommended final concentration, incubation in the dark for 30 min, and measurement of fluorescence (excitation/emission at 485/528 nm). For each antagonist concentration, the mean of triplicate measurements was calculated after subtraction of background fluorescence from cultures killed by 20 μM chloroquine, a known antimalarial agent.

Table 1 shows the growth inhibition data and PSAC inhibition data for compounds of the invention in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

FIGS. 1 and 2 show that parasite growth inhibition correlates with PSAC inhibition for compounds in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

The second type of target validation study involved growth inhibition by combinations of two distinct categories of PSAC antagonists. These antagonist categories were identified in the two separate high-throughput screens. The two screens differed in the permeant solute used to produce PSAC-mediated osmotic lysis and were based on differences in inhibitor affinity identified through basic research studies of PSAC. While sorbitol uptake via PSAC is effectively inhibited by 200 μM furosemide (FIG. 3A), uptake of phenyltrimethyl ammonium (PhTMA+) requires significantly higher concentrations of furosemide and other known antagonists (FIG. 3B). Biophysical studies that included transport of permeating solute mixtures, temperature effects, and electrophysiological correlates suggest that this observation reflects two separate routes solutes may take through PSAC. Here, these routes are referred to as channel components “A” and “B”. The two high-throughput screens were therefore designed to identify specific inhibitors of each component.

FIG. 3C is an isobologram for parasite killing by combinations of compound 18 (a component B antagonist) and compound 24 (a component A antagonist). The symbols represent compound mixtures that produce 50% parasite killing. The solid line represents the line of additive killing. The data points are all below the solid line, indicating synergistic parasite killing by this combination.

Table 2 shows results of in vitro parasite growth inhibition studies using combinations of two component A antagonists (above horizontal divider line), two component B antagonist (right of vertical divider line), or mixtures using an antagonist for each component (bottom left quadrant). Additive and synergistic parasite killing are indicated by “Ad” and “S”, respectively.

While antagonists from both screens kill parasites at low micromolar concentrations when applied individually, there was marked synergistic killing when a component A antagonist was combined with a component B antagonist (FIG. 3C). Multiple permutations of antagonist combinations have been evaluated. Despite the use of several different chemical scaffolds, these experiments revealed that nearly all combinations that inhibit both channel components produce synergistic parasite killing. In contrast, combinations using two antagonists of the same channel component produced only additive parasite killing (Table 2). These finding provide independent validation of PSAC as a drug target and support our biophysical model of transport via two routes through the channel.
