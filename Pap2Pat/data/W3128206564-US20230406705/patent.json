                        "Boron nitride nanotubes can be obtained by, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-230830 (JP-A-2007-230830), reacting a mixture of magnesium oxide, iron II oxide (FeO), and boron powder with ammonia gas at a temperature between 1100\u00b0 C. and 1700\u00b0 C., for example. The obtained boron nitride nanotubes are treated with nitric acid to remove magnesium and iron that are used as catalysts. With such the method, uniform boron nitride nanotubes having diameters between 20 nm and 50 nm can be obtained. The obtained boron nitride nanotubes are then added to an organic solvent solution in which poly [m-phenylenevinylene-co-(2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene)], which is a high polymer, is dissolved in an organic solvent such as chloroform. JP-A-2007-230830 discloses that the boron nitride nanotubes are coated by the above polymer, i.e., polymer-wrapped, so as to obtain a uniform and transparent dispersion liquid of boron nitride nanotubes. JP-A-2007-230830 also discloses a refining method in which the uniform transparent dispersion liquid is produced by removing impurities by a two-hour ultrasonic treatment at a room temperature and a centrifugal separation, evaporating the organic solvent from the dispersion liquid, and further eliminating PmPV by pyrolysis so as to obtain boron nitride nanotubes with uniform diameters. In the descriptions below, poly [m-phenylenevinylene-co-(2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene)] will be shortened as PmPV.",
                        "In recent years, as shown in Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Publication for Patent Application No. 2016-521240 (JP-T-2016-521240), it has been possible to very efficiently produce moderately pure and thin (having diameters of 10 nm or less) boron nitride nanotubes (hereinafter, shortened as BNNTs) continuously and at high yield at or near the atmospheric pressure without a need for using metals as catalysts. To be specific, JP-T-2016-521240 discloses a method for producing BNNTs, where the method includes a step of providing one or more sources of each of boron, nitrogen, and hydrogen into a stable induction plasma at a plasma temperature in a range between 1,000 K and 10,000 K to form a reaction mixture of boron, nitrogen, and hydrogen in a plasma at a pressure more than 0.6 atm and less than 2 atm, and a step of cooling the reaction mixture to form BNNTs, in which the one or more boron sources include a boron element, boron nitride, borane, ammonia borane, borazine, or a mixture of any of the above.",
                        "International Patent Publication No. 2020/031883 (WO 2020/031883) discloses a material using such the boron nitride nanotubes. Such the material includes boron nitride nanotubes and hollow particles of boron nitride fullerenes, in which the hollow particles of boron nitride fullerenes are dispersed between the boron nitride nanotubes, the hollow particles of boron nitride fullerenes existing among and being in contact with the boron nitride nanotubes. WO 2020/031883 also discloses a method in which boron in boron nitride nanotubes obtained by the method disclosed in JP-T-2016-521240, for example, is converted into boron oxide (B2O3) by a thermal oxidation treatment and the boron oxide is then cleansed and removed by a solvent such as ethanol, methanol, or water, in which the boron oxide can dissolve.",
                        "It has been a problem that the products synthesized by the producing methods disclosed in JP-A-2007-230830 and JP-T-2016-521240 include a high proportion of by-products such as boron nitride fullerene and boron nitride thin pieces, which have smaller aspect ratio than boron nitride nanotubes with less reinforcing effects when combined with metals or ceramics. The by-products such as boron nitride fullerene and boron nitride thin pieces have similar crystal structures as boron nitride nanotubes and are easily formed in the synthesis process. Thus, JP-A-2007-230830 discloses a refining method for reducing the proportion of such the by-products. However, this raises another problem of low yielding of boron nitride nanotubes. Furthermore, there is yet another problem of low dispersibility of boron nitride nanotubes due to adhesion between the boron nitride nanotubes and the by-products through the thermal oxidation treatment described in JP-T-2016-521240 and WO 2020/031883."

                        "Hereinafter, a method for producing boron nitride nanotubes according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the descriptions below, boron nitride nanotubes may be shortened as BNNTs.",
                        "First, a step of obtaining a suspension by mixing a starting material that includes a product after synthesis from which water is removed, i.e., boron nitride nanotubes, a nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group, and an organic solvent. In this step, it is preferable that the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group is dissolved in the organic solvent in advance to make a homogeneous solution so as to coat the boron nitride nanotubes uniformly with the polymer dispersant. The product after synthesis is then added to the solution, and, by ultrasonic dispersion using a homogenizer or the like, the polymer dispersant coats the boron nitride nanotubes uniformly. To prevent an increase in temperature of the liquid during the ultrasonic dispersion, it is preferable that the solution is cooled throughout the process.",
                        "In the present invention, \u201cthe product after synthesis\u201d refers to not only the products in a state immediately after synthesis but also refers to those treated with other processes after synthesis of BNNTs and before the step according to the present invention. That is, the starting material including boron nitride nanotubes refers not only to the products that are intact after synthesis, but also refers to the boron nitride nanotubes from which by-products contained in the products that are intact after synthesis are removed to a certain extent by other treatments. Thus, in descriptions hereafter, \u201cthe product after synthesis\u201d refers to all the materials that include boron nitride nanotubes that are used in producing processes for BNNT according to the present invention that will be described below.",
                        "As the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group, it is preferable to use a cellulosic polymer, such as ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, propyl cellulose, butyl cellulose, hydroxyl propyl cellulose, and acetyl cellulose, which is a high polymer in which at least one of replaceable hydroxyl groups at 2-position, 3-position, and 6-position has a substituted glucose structure, i.e., alkyl ether, as a repeating unit and the hydroxyl groups at 1 and 4 positions are combined, or a vinyl polymer, such as poly vinyl butyral, poly vinyl formal, poly vinyl acetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer, polystyrene, poly vinyl alcohol, poly acrylonitrile, poly vinyl methyl ketone, and poly methyl methacrylate, which is a high polymer having at least one or more methylene groups and at least one or more substituted methylene groups as repeating units. This is because, since symmetry of \u03c0 orbital of the boron nitride nanotubes is low, a polymer that interacts with boron nitride nanotubes in CH/\u03c0 can be more easily combined with boron nitride nanotubes than a polymer that interacts with boron nitride nanotubes in \u03c0/\u03c0, such as the polymer used in JP-A-2007-230830. Also, the main chain of the nonionic polymer having an sp3-bonded CH group is more flexible than the main chain of an sp2-bonding of a polymer used in JP-A-2007-230830, and is easier to be wrapped around the boron nitride nanotube having a thin diameter. For this reason, particularly for the boron nitride nanotubes having thin diameters obtained in JP-T-2016-521240 or WO 2020/031883, it is considered that using the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group is easier in coating.",
                        "Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) used widely as a polymer dispersant for carbon nanotubes (CNT) is an ionic polymer having an sp3-bonded CH group, in which an aqueous solvent is used. If such the CMC is applied as a dispersant for thin BNNTs, micelles are formed around the BNNTs and the BNNTs are contained in a hydrophobic space formed by the micelles, which solubilizes the BNNTs. However, since sizes of the micelles follow shapes of substances and the micelles solubilize substances regardless of their shapes, by-products other than the BNNTs are also solubilized. Thus, it is considered that it is difficult for CMC to selectively solubilize only the BNNTs having small diameters. On the other hand, in the case of the nonionic polymer having an sp3-bonded CH group, the organic solvent is used and thus micelles are not formed around the BNNTs. Accordingly, the difference between the shapes and sizes of the BNNTs and impurities (the by-products other than the BNNTs) results in a difference in adsorption properties of dispersant to the BNNTs and the impurities, respectively, as well as solubilization properties of the BNNTs and the impurities. This makes it easier to separate the BNNTs from the impurities, and thus the BNNTs can be dispersed selectively.",
                        "As the organic solvent, benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, N-methyl pyrrolidon, N,N-dimethyl form amide, cyclohexanone, isophorone, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, ethyl lactate, butyl lactate, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or the like may be used.",
                        "After mixing the starting material, the dispersant, and the organic solvent, the mixture may be stirred by using an ultrasonic homogenizer, for example. The mixture is stirred under predetermined stirring conditions, followed by a separation process, which will be described below, and then SEM images or the like of a supernatant liquid and residues are checked to determine conditions for stirring according to separation performance of the by-products and fracture prevention effects of the BNNTs. For example, after stirring under a plurality of conditions and checking the respective images after separation, conditions under which an amount of the by-products found in the supernatant liquid is relatively small and fractures and breakage of the BNNTs are unnoticeable, or conditions under which an amount of fractured BNNTs in the residue is unnoticeable may be used. For example, a frequency of 20 kHz, an ultrasonic wave amplitude between 40 \u03bcm and 80 \u03bcm, and a stirring time approximately between 20 minutes and 40 minutes are preferable since the boron nitride nanotubes are not easily fractured and can be easily dispersed under such conditions. The suspension can be obtained through the above operations.",
                        "The composition of the product after synthesis, that is the suspension liquid obtained by mixing the starting material including the boron nitride nanotubes, the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group, and the organic solvent, may be 1 pts.mass of the starting material including the boron nitride nanotubes, 1-2000 pts.mass of the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group, and 200-100000 pts.mass of the organic solvent. A lower limit of an amount of added dispersant is determined, for example, according to separation performance of the by-products after performing the separation process described below and checking the SEM images or the like of the supernatant liquid and the residues. For example, the amount of added dispersant is varied under a plurality of conditions, and from the respective images after separation, conditions under which the amount of the BNNTs found in the supernatant liquid is relatively large and the BNNTs are not bundled, or conditions under which an amount of BNNTs within the residue is unnoticeable may be used. Also, by checking an optical absorption characteristic in the ultraviolet region of the dispersion liquid after the separation process described below and by using a relationship between the maximum absorption amount and the amount added, an upper limit of the amount of added dispersant is determined from a condition at which an increase in an amount of the optical absorption due to an increase in the amount added is approximately saturated, for example. This range of the dispersant and solvent is preferable because it is economical without waste at or under the upper limit, and the dispersibility of BNNTs is better at or above the lower limit. To confirm whether there is bundling of the BNNTs or not, the SEM images or the like are checked and it can be confirmed that several to several tens of BNNTs are bundled during the dispersion if the dispersed BNNTs are thicker than the BNNTs in the starting material, for example.",
                        "Next, a centrifugal separation process of the obtained suspension will be described. This operation removes the by-products. Here, the by-products refer to BN fullerenes and h-BN thin pieces etc. contained in the above solution having boron particles as a core. The conditions for separating such the by-products by centrifugal separation are determined according to separation performance of the by-products after performing the separation process and checking the SEM images or the like of a supernatant liquid and residue. For example, a plurality of conditions (time and centrifugal force) are varied, and from the respective images after separation, conditions under which the amount of the by-products found in the supernatant liquid is relatively small and an amount of the dispersant polymer (the film-like substance coating the by-products as a whole) within the residue is large may be used. For example, a centrifugal acceleration may be 30,000 G or more, a processing time may be one hour or more, and a liquid temperature may be 25\u00b0 C.",
                        "Finally, a process for removing the by-products contained in the starting material by centrifugal separation of the obtained suspension to obtain a dispersion liquid including the boron nitride nanotubes will be described. The by-products can be removed from the suspension by using a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge, for example. By removing the by-products contained in the starting material, a BNNT dispersion liquid in which BNNTs that are coated by the nonionic polymer having an sp3-bonded CH group are dispersed in the organic solvent can be obtained.",
                        "Furthermore, a method for obtaining BNNTs from the BNNT dispersion liquid will be described. First, the organic solvent is evaporated from the above-mentioned BNNT dispersion liquid. With this step, BNNT is coated by a solid polymer dispersant. Next, the BNNTs coated by the above-mentioned dispersant is heated in an atmosphere at a temperature between 300\u00b0 C. and 900\u00b0 C. so as to remove the dispersant by pyrolysis. This can refine the BNNTs contained in the dispersion liquid to be highly refined. The heating temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or higher is preferable since the dispersant can be thermally decomposed easily at the heating temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or higher. On the other hand, the temperature of 900\u00b0 C. or lower is preferable since the BNNTs can remain without being burned out at the temperature of 900\u00b0 C. or lower. Furthermore, the temperature below 650\u00b0 C. is preferable since the temperature below 650\u00b0 C. is lower than a temperature of thermal oxidation process of the boron particles and this can prevent adhesion between the boron nitride nanotubes and the by-products, which makes it easier for the boron nitride nanotubes to be dispersed."

Firstly, a small plasma device (TekNano-15 by TEKNA Plasma Systems Inc.) is used in the following manner to synthesize BNNT products including by-products, i.e., a starting material including boron nitride nanotubes. Initially, a reaction vessel is purged with argon gas. Next, argon gas flows into a central region (flow rate: 10 L/min), and sheath gas flows on an outer circumference of a tube confining plasma by flowing a mixed gas of argon (30 L/min) and hydrogen (2.5 L/min). Nitrogen gas flows through both a torch nozzle (10 L/min) and a porous wall (47 L/min) surrounding the reaction vessel. A few minutes after plasma ignition, when a temperature of a thermocouple provided between the reaction vessel and a cyclone becomes constant, h-BN powder (average particle diameter: 5 \u03bcm), which is the raw material, is continuously supplied from a feeder installed at an upper part of the plasma torch with argon (2.5 L/min) as carrier gas. The feed rate is 0.5 g/min, the operation time is two hours, and the pressure inside the reaction chamber is 1 atm. After completion of the synthesis, the device is disassembled and products adhering to the plasma torch, reactor, cyclone, and filter sections are collected.",

FIG. 1 is a low magnification image under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) of the obtained products. The products include a BNNT 101, a BN fullerene 102, and an h-BN thin piece 103. The BN fullerene 102 is a substance having a grapheme structure in which B atoms and N atoms are alternately coupled and having a closed spherical or long spherical structure. Also, the h-BN thin piece 103 is a sheet-shaped substance formed of crystalline h-BN. Boron particles (black contrasting areas) are incorporated into the BN fullerene 102. Other synthesizing method may also be used to synthesize the products.",
                                "Next, the products after synthesis are used and treated by the following method as Working Example 1. 25 mg of ethyl cellulose (EC) manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. as the dispersant is mixed with 20 cm 3 of benzyl alcohol as the organic solvent, and the mg of the products synthesized as above is added to the solution. That is, to 1 pts.mass of the products after synthesis, i.e., the starting material including boron nitride nanotubes, 1.7 pts.mass of the nonionic polymer dispersant having an sp3-bonded CH group and 1333 pts.mass of the organic solvent are used. The mixture is then dispersed by an ultrasonic homogenizer at a room temperature for twenty minutes. This is followed by centrifugal separation with a centrifugal acceleration of 30,000 G for three hours to remove the by-products contained in the starting material and to obtain a BNNT dispersion liquid.",

It is found that BN fullerene and h-BN thin pieces contained in the post-products after synthesis shown in FIG. 1 are removed. This shows that a proportion of the by-products such as BN fullerene and h-BN thin pieces having small strengthening effects is reduced.",

Although a step of oxidation in the atmosphere at a temperature within a range between 650\u00b0 C. and 800\u00b0 C. is required as a thermal oxidation treatment in JP-T-2016-521240, such the process is not performed in Working Example 1.",

It is observed that the amorphous layer on the BNNT surface has disappeared, and, with sidewalls of BNNT 401 being clearly observed, it is confirmed that the BNNTs are in perfect crystallized states."
