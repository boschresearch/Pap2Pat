The computer-implemented method includes performing private set intersection between two record sets to determine identical intersecting records corresponding to a particular record field.

                        "The present invention relates generally to the field of entity resolution, and more particularly to, private set intersection (PSI) and local sensitivity hashing (LSH) to preserve sensitive material while determining data intersection.",
                        "Recently, as the awareness for privacy increases and new regulations are enforced, there is a growing need for privacy preserving Entity-Resolution, and in particular, privacy preserving Record-Linkage (PPRL). For example, in the case where two companies need to learn their common clients or the number of such common clients, they typically cannot conduct such intersections openly, because this would reveal too much information to the other side or to eavesdroppers. The main challenge is due to the fact that the records do not match exactly due to the same client may differ slightly, due to various causes, such as typos, omissions, different styles, or different word ordering. Unfortunately, few practical protocols exist that securely perform such \u201cfuzzy\u201d record linkage without revealing some private data of the parties, and can do so within a reasonable time even for very large sets of data. The use of trusted third party may be a part of the solution, but is oftentimes undesirable, as it may introduce further security/privacy issues, and is thus avoided by the present invention.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention recognize that commonly used hashing algorithms typically hash different inputs to different hash values such that collisions in the outputs are avoided or difficult to find. Even a small difference in the input can cause a dramatically different hash value. A Locality-Sensitive-Hashing (LSH) algorithm, on the other hand, deliberately hashes \u201csimilar\u201d inputs to \u201csimilar\u201d output hash value, where hashes are considered \u201csimilar\u201d as described in further detail below.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention provide for the ability of separate entities, without the use of a trusted third party, to find matching private data records between their respective databases, in a manner in which no private information is disclosed to either party, even when detected matches are not identical, but rather similar. In an embodiment, Private-Set Intersection (PSI) is not applied to the record fields of a dataset directly, but rather is applied to a Local-Sensitive-Hash (i.e., a hash that returns the same value for \u201csimilar\u201d inputs) of the record fields calculated separately by each entity before performing PSI. Thus, the resulting intersection is those records between parties that have a matching LSH, and are thus considered to have a high probability of being similar. Each LSH is composed of multiple \u201cband signatures\u201d and two LSHs are considered matching when at they include at least one such band signature in common. The PSI is then carried out on these band signatures of the LSHs in order to privately learn the matching LSHs and thus the matching records.",
                        "In an embodiment, a fast PSI over regular hashes of selected record fields (e.g., a non-sensitive local hash, such as SHA-256) from each entities dataset is performed and matching records are eliminated. This initial \u201cpre-processing step\u201d reduces the number of records that will need to be considered in the later, more costly processing steps. PSI is then run over the LSHs (specifically, over their band signatures), which cleanly separates those record pairs that are very similar (e.g., having a similarity score above a predetermined threshold) from those record pairs that are not very similar (e.g., having a similarity below a predetermined threshold).",
                        "In an embodiment, a LSH includes b bands, where each of these b bands includes r min-hash signatures. In an embodiment, two records (or strings) are considered \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cmatching\u201d if their two corresponding LSH's share a band\u2014i.e., all the r min-hash signatures in some band from LSH1 of Record 1 are the same as the r min-hash signatures of some band from LSH2 of Record 2. Embodiments of the present invention determine if two records have a shared band in their LSH in a privacy-preserving manner using PSI. We also propose to optimize the accuracy and performance of our method by searching for the best b and r parameters using conventional optimization methods.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention considers one record entry as matching another record entry when the LSHs of the two record entries share at least one of their b signatures, in which case the probability that they are an actual match is at least P, as set up by the optimization process. However, if more signatures match, the probability there is an exact match is in fact higher. The \u201cscore\u201d of the match can relate to the number of shared signatures.",
                        "In other embodiments, the Jaccard similarity index which serves as the similarity score can be computed directly in a privacy-preserving manner by running the basic PSI protocol for the sets of shingles (i.e., overlapping substrings of fixed length of the concatenated fields of the compared records) of every candidate pairs. In an embodiment, if a score is to be produced for the pair RA of Dataset A of Party A and RB of Dataset B of Party B, then Party A and Party B run the PSI protocol to privately compute the Jaccard index, i.e. the number of shared shingles divided by the total number of shingles\u2212|{shingles of RA}\u00d7{shingles of RB}|/|{shingles of RA} U {shingles of RB}|. Since just the size of these sets are needed here, one may use the embodiments of the present invention that only compute the size of the intersection |{shingles of RA}\u00d7{shingles of RB}| without revealing the shared shingles themselves. The size of the union |{shingles of RA} U {shingles of RB}| is the sum of the number of shingles of RA and RB (known to both parties performing the PSI) minus this size of the intersection.",

Data cleaning refers to techniques to \u2018clean\u2019 data by removing outliers, replacing missing values, smoothing noisy data, and correcting inconsistent data. Data integration removes redundant or inconsistent data. Data reduction includes condensing the data set that is smaller in volume, while maintaining the integrity of the original data set.

                        "In an embodiment, preprocessing includes determining cyclic shingles for each data set. Shingles are substrings of fixed length extracted from the concatenated fields of the record. Cyclic shingles start near the end of the concatenated fields and cycle back to the beginning. For example, if the concatenated fields are the string \u201cJohn Doe Sunset Street 7034 Los Angeles\u201d, then \u201ceet 70\u201d is a 6-character shingle, and \u201celesJo\u201d is a 6-character cyclic shingle. The computation of a shingle set can be performed for example by extracting the k-shingles from the data string, after concatenating the first k\u22121 letters of the string to its end, where k is the desired shingle size. Then, the extraction of the shingles is done by taking every consecutive k letters in the new string. This gives a similar amount of weight for each letter in the original string. For example, without using this method, the first and last letters of the string may only appear in one shingle. Using this method, every letter appears in k shingles. In an embodiment, the text string is broken into a set of overlapping substrings of size k called shingles, i.e., every k consecutive characters in the string is an element in the set. In an embodiment, the similarity of two strings is measured in terms of shared shingles. In an embodiment, the \u201cJaccard similarity\u201d of two strings is the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of their respective sets of shingles.",

In an embodiment, private set intersection determines the exact matches between the one or more record sets. In an embodiment, private data intersection program 101 performs a fast PSI of selected record fields (i.e., non-sensitive local hash) from each respective data set and matching pairs with identical fields (or identical subsets of fields) are eliminated.

Private data intersection 101 may then apply the same one-hundred different hashing functions to Record B, Record C . . . Record N of Data Set 1. The application of a hash function to compute the min-hash value of a record involves evaluating the hash function over all the shingles of the record and returning the minimal result. This type of hash is called a MIN-HASH.",

For example, if 100 min-hashes are computed for the record, then they may be grouped into b=20 bands of r=5 min-hashes per band. In an embodiment, private data intersection program 101 takes these r min-hash values of a band and hashes them into a respective band signature. In an embodiment, private data intersection program 101 repeats this process b times to produce b signatures. The resulting tuple of b signatures is the LSH of the record.

The probability that this is indeed a true match increases if there are more than just the one required shared band\u2014the more shared bands out of the total b bands\u2014the higher the probability that the match estimate is correct. In addition, if b is configured to be smaller, then the fact that there is even just a single shared band is more significant. Thus, having a single shared band when b is set to be small indicates a higher probability that the match is true than if the single shared band is one of many bands. For example, 1 shared band out of b=4 bands indicates a much higher probability of similarity than one shared band out of b=400 bands. Also, two shared bands out of b=4 bands indicates a higher probability of similarity than just one shared band out of b=4 bands.",

Picking different parameters may also lead to privacy tradeoffs (since the pairs that are considered \u201csimilar\u201d according to the parameters are those that will be divulged to the users). Therefore private, data intersection program 101 solves the optimization problem of finding b and r that meet the security and match-control requirements while minimizing b for the sake of performance.

Both users will perform this process to the records they receive from the other user.

Once a collection is signed by N members it is distributed by the last signing member to the other members, so that each member has N collections, each signed by N members.

Alternately, records can be considered as candidates if the field (e.g., a home address field) contains a similar value. The rules can be ordered in the order in which they are to be applied. Rules that are fast to apply (e.g., just PSI with identical field checks) are applied first, so that the resulting candidates are not considered during the application of the latter more costly rules (that may require many band computations for similarity checks).",
