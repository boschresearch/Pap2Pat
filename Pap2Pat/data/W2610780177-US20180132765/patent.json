    "abstract": "A method for determining hearing thresholds in the absence of pure-tone testing includes an adaptive speech recognition test which includes a calibrated item pool, each item having a difficulty value (di) and associated standard error (se). Test items are administered to a group of individuals having mild to moderately severe hearing loss to obtain responses. The responses are subjected to multiple regression statistical methods to develop an equation for converting an individual's test score to hearing threshold values at several frequencies. The adaptive speech recognition test can be administered to an individual and their score can be converted into hearing thresholds at each of the several frequencies by use of the equation.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "To date, speech recognition scores have not been used to predict hearing thresholds. Hearing thresholds are not highly correlated with scores on conventional measures of speech recognition and, as such, it is counterintuitive that scores on any measure of speech recognition could be used to predict hearing thresholds.",
                        "The degree of an individual's hearing loss generally is quantified in terms of the magnitude or level of a sound needed for him/her to detect it. The smallest intensity of a sound needed by a person to detect its presence is referred to as his/her threshold for that sound. In practice, hearing threshold is defined as the lowest intensity at which an individual responds to a sound on approximately half of the occasions on which it is presented. Typically, the sounds used to test an individual's hearing are pure tones presented at different frequencies (i.e., octave intervals from 0.25 kHz to 8 kHz). Standard audiometric evaluations include the determination of pure-tone thresholds. Providing clinicians with estimates of clients' hearing thresholds prior to the audiometric evaluation could enhance efficiency in clinical practice in the same way that ophthalmologists enhance efficiency by having a technician administer an eye test for refraction prior to the patient seeing the doctor.",
                        "In clinical practice, hearing thresholds are determined via a standard testing procedure administered by an audiologist using specialized equipment (a properly calibrated clinical audiometer) in a specialized environment (a sound-treated booth) and, as such, cannot be determined over the internet. Hearing thresholds indicate the severity and configuration of hearing loss and serve as the input for programming hearing aids. They also can be used to determine whether or not a personal sound amplification product (PSAP) would be an appropriate option for individual consumers. Currently, people wishing to purchase a PSAP often have no way of knowing if it would be appropriate for them, so having information concerning their hearing thresholds would empower consumers to make better health care decisions. In addition, individuals wishing to purchase a programmable hearing aid over the internet must see a hearing health care provider to obtain their hearing thresholds. This represents an additional cost to the consumer. Hearing aid sales, unlike the sale of PSAPs, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as state authorities. As such, government regulations currently require consumers to visit a licensed hearing health care provider in order to obtain their hearing thresholds for the purpose of programming hearing aids. Therefore, in principle, enabling hearing thresholds to be determined using a self-administered test delivered over the internet has the potential to facilitate direct sales of PSAPs and hearing aids to consumers, significantly reducing cost and increasing accessibility for millions of individuals.",
                        "Hearing aids are beginning to be sold directly to consumers over the internet at deep discounts from the normal retail cost. By selling hearing aids at deeply discounted prices, distributors are likely to cut into revenue for audiologists working within the current business model in which they serve as middlemen for dispensing hearing aids to consumers. Similarly, PSAPs cost considerably less than hearing aids and also are available over the internet and at some pharmacies and other retailers. The sale of these devices also is likely to cut into revenue for audiologists. The problem with the current business model in hearing health care is that it is not sustainable because the middleman's mark-up and services more than double the consumer's cost. Therefore, it is likely that hearing aids and PSAPs will continue to be sold directly to consumers over the internet, and alternative means of obtaining hearing thresholds will be needed to maximize their sales and accessibility to members of the general public, especially to first-time users of amplification and individuals who are highly cost-conscious."

                        "This invention provides a method for determining hearing thresholds of an individual in the absence of pure-tone testing. An embodiment of the method includes an adaptive speech recognition test. The adaptive speech recognition test can be administered to an individual to determine hearing thresholds of the individual. A suitable adaptive speech recognition test includes a plurality of items. In an embodiment, each item can include two trials and each trial can include two spoken utterances, e.g., a standard utterance followed by a comparison utterance. Other numbers of trials and utterances are suitable for use in the method. The comparison utterance can be the same or different from the standard utterance in each trial. The plurality of items may be referred to herein as the pool of items or item pool. A suitable adaptive speech recognition test can be developed by administering items from the item pool to a first group of individuals having mild to moderately severe hearing loss to obtain their responses. In an embodiment, each one of the items in the item pool is administered to each member of the first group of individuals to obtain their responses to each item. An item is scored correct if and only if the response to both trials is correct. The responses to the items from the first group of individuals are subjected to a scaling analysis to assign a difficulty value (di) and associated standard error (se) to each item, thereby creating a calibrated item pool. The calibrated item pool can be used for adaptive speech recognition testing of a second group of individuals to develop an equation for converting adaptive speech recognition test performance into hearing thresholds. The second group of individuals can be the same or different than the first group of individuals. Items from the calibrated item pool are administered to the second group of individuals having mild to moderately severe hearing loss to obtain their responses. In an embodiment, a subset of the items in the calibrated item pool is administered using the adaptive test to each member of the second group of individuals to obtain their responses to each item. An item is scored correct if and only if the response to both trials is correct. The responses to each item are used to calculate a test score for each individual. Multiple regression statistical methods are applied to the test scores of the second group together with other variables, such as an individual's age and perception of hearing handicap to develop an equation for converting an individual's test score to hearing threshold values at several frequencies. The adaptive speech recognition test can be administered to a single individual to obtain a test score. The test score can be converted into hearing thresholds of the individual at each of the several frequencies using the equation.",
                        "The adaptive speech recognition test is a diagnostic tool which produces data that can be used for predicting hearing thresholds, screening for hearing loss and other purposes for the individual tested (e.g., determining whether a personal sound amplification product (PSAP) might be an appropriate option for a consumer and saving clinicians time by guiding them to clients' hearing thresholds). The adaptive speech recognition test can be delivered by methods known in the art, such as via a computer-interactive assessment system. The test can be administered, for example, by a software application to efficiently provide meaningful information about the perceptual capabilities of listeners across a wide range of hearing thresholds, including mild to profound hearing losses.",
                        "An embodiment for developing suitable items for use in the present method includes stimulus materials composed of utterances which include linguistic contrasts (primarily minimal pairs). Preferably, naturalistic sentence-length utterances are used; but utterances composed of single words, phrases or more than one sentence also can be used. The linguistic contrasts contained in the utterances involve phonetic features of consonants such as place, manner, and voicing, as well as features of vowels. In addition to segmental contrasts in phonetic features of place, manner and voicing and features of vowels, the test includes items containing contrasts in sentence prosody (i.e., gross time-intensity variations in the speech waveform envelope combined with contrasts at the syllable and word levels). Preferably, the test contains linguistic contrasts distributed over four broad linguistic categories: 1) sentence prosody; 2) voicing and vowels; 3) manner of articulation; and 4) place of articulation.",
                        "Contrasts in place of articulation are manifested within voiced and voiceless stop and fricative consonants (i.e., /p-t/, /p-k/, /t-k/, /b-d/, /b-g/, /d-g/, /f-s/, /f-\u222b/, /s-\u222b/, /\u03b8-s/, /\u03b8-\u222b/, /\u03b8-f/, /z-v/, /v-\u00f0/ and /z-\u00f0/). The location of place contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences (i.e., word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions; sentence-initial position is defined herein as the first phrase in a sentence; sentence-final position is defined as the last phrase in a sentence; and sentence-medial position is defined as all other locations within the sentence). Preferably, about 35% of all contrasts occur in this category. In other embodiments, approximately 25-45% of all contrasts occur in the place category. Examples of place contrasts are included in Table 1.",
                        "Contrasts in manner of articulation are manifested within voiced and voiceless stop and fricative consonants produced at the labial and alveolar places of articulation (i.e., /t-s/, /t-\u222b/, /t-\u03b8/, /z-d/, /f-p/, /v-b/, and/d-\u00f0/). The location of manner contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences (i.e., word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions). Preferably, about 25% of all contrasts occur in this category. In other embodiments, approximately 15-35% of all contrasts occur in the manner category. Examples of manner contrasts are included in Table 1.",
                        "Contrasts in voicing are manifested within voiced-voiceless cognates (i.e., stops and fricatives), and contrasts in vowels are manifested across the features of tongue height and tongue advancement, as well as tense-lax vowel pairs. Again, the location of these contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences (i.e., word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions). Preferably, about 20% of all contrasts occur in this category. In other embodiments, approximately 10-30% of all contrasts occur in the voicing and vowels category. Examples of voicing and vowel contrasts are included in Table 1.",
                        "Contrasts in sentence prosody (i.e., gross time-intensity variations in the speech waveform envelope combined with contrasts at the syllable and word levels) are manifested within and between phonological phrases, and their location varies within sentences. Preferably, about 20% of all contrasts occur in this category. In other embodiments, approximately 10-30% of all contrasts occur in this category. Examples of contrasts in sentence prosody are included in Table 1.",
                        "Preferably, about 30% of the contrasts located within words occur in word-initial position; about 30% occur in word-final position; and about 40% occur in word-medial position. In other embodiments, approximately 20-40% of the contrasts located within words occur in word-initial position; about 20-40% occur in word-final position; and about 30-50% occur in word-medial position. With regard to the location of contrasts within sentences, preferably about 20% of contrasts occur in sentence-initial position; about 30% occur in sentence-final position; and about 50% occur in sentence-medial position. In other embodiments, approximately 10-30% of contrasts occur in sentence-initial position; about 20-40% occur in sentence-final position; and about 40-60% occur in sentence-medial position.",
                        "A fifth category of items representing repetitions of the standard sentence also is included in the item pool. This category does not contain any contrastive linguistic elements. Both comparison sentences are repetitions of the standard sentence and, as such, the correct response to each trial for items in this category is \u2018Same.\u2019 Preferably, about 10% of the item pool is composed of items in this category.",
                        "Preferably, the utterances are produced by an adult male voice speaking in a General/Standard American English dialect. Alternately, an adult female voice may be used separately or in combination with a male voice. The utterances also may be produced in other social or regional dialects of English either separately or in combination with the standard dialect.",
                        "In accordance with an embodiment, the utterances are recorded, preferably digitally, and edited to develop a set of audio files. Each audio file is composed of one utterance. The utterances (audio files) are used to construct the test items. The stimuli are digitally recorded at a sampling rate of at least 10 kHz and edited using signal processing software. Preferably, a sampling rate of 11.025 kHz or 22.050 kHz is used. Multiple renditions/tokens of each utterance are recorded, and a good quality, representative token is selected for inclusion in the test. The level of each utterance is adjusted to equalize the overall RMS voltage across stimuli in order to present each stimulus at an approximately equivalent overall level. Although the overall level of each sentence is equivalent, RMS voltage within sentences varies with oscillations in the amplitude of the waveform.",
                        "Each of the recorded materials (test items) is administered to a sample of individuals having mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Each test item is presented to each respondent using a paired comparison discrimination task. For example, a common-item test composed of at least 250 items may be administered to a sample of at least 30 respondents. Preferably, a common-item test composed of approximately at least 600 items is administered to a sample of at least 100 respondents. However, other size groups and number of test items are suitable for use in the present method.",
                        "Although it is possible to design and administer computerized adaptive tests without item response theory (IRT), IRT-based systems have advantages over those which are not IRT-based and thus are preferred. Chief among these advantages is placement of the item difficulty (di) and person ability (bv) estimates on the same numerical scale in IRT, facilitating the selection of items of appropriate difficulty for an individual. IRT scoring procedures also make it possible to estimate a respondent's ability level and the associated standard error or precision immediately following the administration of each test item, the former statistic aiding in item selection, the latter being useful for terminating a testing session.",
                        "IRT models are mathematical abstractions based upon suppositions about what happens when an examinee responds to a test item. The simplest of the IRT models, also the basis of the current test method, is the Rasch (1960) one-parameter logistic model. Item difficulty is an intrinsic parameter of item response theory models, with variations in item difficulty being necessary for the creation of item pools used in adaptive testing. The Rasch model differs significantly from more complicated models in that it is not intended to fit data. Rather, the Rasch model is a definition of measurement. When data are found to fit the model, the measurement of persons and the assignment of difficulty values to items (i.e., calibration of items) enable the placement of persons and items on a common scale which functions according to the rules of arithmetic. This scale uses a logarithmic unit of measurement known as the logit. The logit metric applies to both items and test takers. That is, the logit is a measure of both item difficulty and person ability.",
                        "Data obtained from administration of the common-item tests administered to respondents are subjected to Rasch scaling analysis to develop the calibrated item pool. This analysis assigns a difficulty value (di) and associated standard error (se) to each item of the test. The difficulty value and standard error associated with each item enable the items to be scaled along a continuum of difficulty, providing the basis for the \u201cup-down\u201d psychophysical method of item selection used in adaptive testing.",
                        "The Rasch model for person measurement conceptualizes success or failure on any test item as a function of the difference between an examinee's position on an ability continuum and the difficulty of items scaled along the same continuum. The way that this difference governs the outcome of the person-item interaction is then modeled probabilistically.",
                        "In its simplest form, the Rasch model can be presented as follows:",
                        "Probability {x\u03bd\u03b9=1}=exp(\u03b2\u03bd\u2212\u03b4\u03b9)/[1+exp(\u03b2\u03bd\u2212\u03b4\u03b9)]",

The test uses a paired comparison discrimination task in which a written standard stimulus (accompanied by an optional vocal utterance of the standard stimulus) is paired with two comparison utterances. Respondents must decide if the standard and comparison stimuli in each trial are the same or different from each other. The presentation of an item begins with the presentation of a written representation of the standard stimulus on a computer monitor. Approximately 0.5-3 seconds after the written stimulus is displayed on the monitor and with it still remaining on the monitor, a spoken utterance (i.e., the first comparison utterance) is presented. Preferably, the spoken utterance is presented 1.5 seconds after the written stimulus appears on the monitor. Each respondent indicates if the comparison stimulus is the same or different from the standard stimulus. If the response is correct, then a second comparison stimulus is presented while the printed version of the standard stimulus remains displayed on the monitor. If the response is incorrect, then the next standard stimulus (i.e., the next item) is presented. An item is scored correct when the participant responds correctly to both comparison stimuli. No partial credit is awarded. Therefore, if the response to the first trial is incorrect, the item is scored incorrect, and the standard stimulus for the next item is presented. Elimination of the second trial in this situation is intended to reduce test administration time. All responses are recorded, preferably on a computer hard drive.",
                        "In an alternate embodiment of the above procedure, a spoken version of the standard stimulus is presented simultaneously with the written representation of the standard stimulus and before the presentation of the first comparison stimulus. Thereafter, the procedure is the same. That is, the written stimulus remains on the computer monitor while comparison utterances are presented and listeners enter their responses as described above. In yet another alternate embodiment of the procedure, an item may be composed of more than two trials. In still another embodiment, the respondent may be presented with two trials for each item regardless of whether or not their response to the first trial is correct.",

The model enables the discovery of this continuum and the scaling of item difficulty. The continuum of item difficulty, in turn, provides an implicit hierarchy that enables the adaptive testing procedure to utilize an \u201cup-down\u201d method of item selection to array respondents on the same continuum as the items. The continuum of item difficulty generally reflects the listener's ability to perceive acoustic and phonetic properties of speech, such as phonetic features of place, manner and voicing. The pool of items in the test preferably includes at least 250 items and more preferably includes about 600 unique utterance pairs (items).",

                        "The adaptive speech recognition test of the present invention differs from conventional speech recognition tests in that the testing experience is individualized and automated, with items being selected \u201con the fly\u201d from a large pool by an objective \u201cup-down\u201d method on the basis of their information value. The \u201cup-down\u201d method of item selection is designed such that the items administered to each person are selected from a relatively narrow range of difficulty circumscribing their level of ability, which is itself constantly updated as items are administered during the testing process. The standard error associated with the respondent's performance is used to limit the range of difficulty from which items are selected for presentation within each test session. In limiting the range of difficulty from which items are selected, the up-down procedure greatly reduces measurement error in comparison to conventional word recognition tests. Importantly, the adaptive item selection procedure enhances measurement precision for individuals in comparison to conventional word recognition tests because of the systematic manner in which the up-down psychophysical method brackets the respondent's speech recognition ability level within progressively smaller ranges of measurement error. The standard error (se) determines the step size for the up-down procedure and can be set at values of \u00b11.0, \u00b11.5 or \u00b12.0 se depending upon the psychometric properties of the item pool and the level of measurement precision desired. Preferably, a setting of \u00b11.5 se is used as the default value.",
                        "Scores on the test have been shown to be highly reliable, having an internal consistency reliability of 0.98, as determined by the person separation reliability index commonly used in Rasch scaling analysis. Prespecification of the level of measurement accuracy or reliability required of respondents is built into the functionality of the adaptive testing software. In practice, there is a trade-off between the accuracy of test results and test administration time. As more test items are administered to a respondent, the accuracy (reliability) of the test score increases and so does the test administration time. Therefore, in practice, examiners can determine an appropriate balance between the accuracy of test results and test administration time.",
                        "The test can be administered in both quiet and background noise of 20-talker babble presented at +5 dB SNR. The software application enables test length, defined in terms of the maximum number of items (e.g., 10-60 items) and/or time of test duration (e.g., 3-20 minutes) to be varied. For example, elderly individuals in good physical health generally complete about 35 items within a five-minute test. Preferably, the test uses a maximum length of 40 items and a maximum duration of 5 minutes. Also, reliability values can be changed to different settings (e.g., 0.75, 0.80, 0.85 or 0.90), as can standard error of measurement (\u00b11.0, \u00b11.5 or \u00b12.0), in an effort to achieve specific degrees of measurement precision. Preferably, the test uses 0.90 as the default setting for reliability and \u00b11.5 as the default setting for standard error. These values have proven practical and useful within the context of the present invention.",

For example, a preferred embodiment includes approximately 600 pairs of utterances in the test item pool. An item is composed of one standard and two comparison stimuli as described above. Through differing permutations and combinations of standard/comparison stimuli within the item pool, the 600 pairs of utterances (test items) can be increased to more than 3,000 test items. Associated with each item is a di value characterizing its location (magnitude) on the variable that is measured by the test (i.e., speech recognition ability). The di values, expressed in logits or log units, are generally referred to as item calibrations or difficulty measures.",

The stimuli may be presented in a sound field to both ears (binaurally) or to one ear (monaurally) by isolating the non-test ear with an earplug. Alternately, the stimuli may be presented monaurally to each ear using earphones. In the preferred embodiment, a written representation of each standard stimulus appears on a computer monitor as comparison stimuli are presented acoustically. Examinees indicate whether the comparison sentences are the \u2018same\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019 via computer mouse. If no response is produced within a preset response interval, the trial is scored incorrect. Items are scored correct when both discrimination judgments (i.e., both trials) are correct. This scoring practice is designed to decrease the influence of random guessing in the ability estimation procedure. Testing can begin with several practice items.",
                        "The application can use preexisting data (e.g., respondent age and self-perception of hearing ability) to determine the difficulty (di) of the first test item to be administered to an individual. Specifically, the first item is empirically related to one or more of the following three variables: (1) prior performance on the test; (2) the respondent's age expressed in years; and (3) an indicator variable reflecting a respondent's perception of their hearing ability. Using equations derived from OLS regression techniques, these data can be used to guide the test application where testing is to begin by predicting a point on the continuum of item difficulty proximal to the respondent's level of ability. This enhances the efficiency and accuracy of measurement.",

The first stage of testing, the routing test, proceeds until an individual responds correctly and incorrectly to the items presented. To illustrate, the first item administered has, for example, di=0.25 logit. If the examinee responds correctly (incorrectly), an item of greater (lesser) difficulty is administered next. The increment (decrement), here 0.50 logit, remains fixed and constant at this stage of testing. Thus, the second item to be administered will be that item in the pool having difficulty closest to +0.75 or \u22120.75 logit depending on the response to the previous item. The fixed increment (decrement) is continued until at least one correct and one incorrect response have been observed. The magnitude of the fixed increment may be varied depending upon the psychometric characteristics of the item pool.",

Thus, for individuals for whom both correct and incorrect responses have not been observed upon reaching the extremities of difficulty or easiness, testing terminates with a message indicating that these individuals have speech recognition ability levels which are indeterminate. The maximum length of the routing test (M) is set at the onset of testing (e.g., the maximum length may range from 7-14 items). Preferably, the maximum length of the routing test (M) is set to M=10 items.",
                        "When at least one correct and one incorrect response to the test items have been observed for an individual, a finite maximum likelihood estimate of ability (bv), as well as its associated standard error se, can be computed. This occurs in the second stage of testing. The numerical estimation method employed here possesses the property that an individual's number right or raw score is a sufficient statistic for estimation of the ability parameter.",
                        "Using the estimate of ability bv computed in the previous programming step, test items in the pool that have not already been administered are evaluated for their potential to provide additional information about the examinee. Specifically, the next item to be administered will be that item which has di closest to bv, with the further condition that the difference between the ability estimate and the selected item's difficulty must be less than the standard error associated with the ability estimate. If these two conditions cannot be met, the testing is terminated with a message that test items of appropriate difficulty have been exhausted. After each newly selected test item is presented and the examinee's response is evaluated for correctness/incorrectness, the bv is revised, making use of the additional information. The revised bv is compared, as earlier, with the di of items remaining in the pool that have not already been administered. In this way, test items continue to be administered to an examinee as long as the difference between the item difficulty and each newly computed bv remains within a decreasing standard error of measurement.",

Each of these test termination criteria is set in advance by the examiner, preferably based on factors such as practicality and usefulness. Experience demonstrates that it is practical and useful to terminate testing after five minutes or 40 items, whichever occurs first in the testing session, or after a reliability of 0.90 has been attained.

                        "As described above, the NSRT\u00ae uses a paired comparison discrimination task in which a standard sentence is paired with two comparison sentences. The presentation of an item begins with the presentation of a written representation of the standard sentence on a computer monitor. Approximately 1.5 seconds after the written sentence is displayed on the monitor and with it still remaining on the monitor, a spoken utterance (i.e., the first comparison sentence) is presented. The respondent must indicate if the comparison sentence is the same or different from the standard sentence. If the response is correct, then a second comparison sentence is presented while the printed version of the standard sentence remains displayed on the monitor. If the response is incorrect, then the next standard sentence (i.e., the next item) is presented. An item is scored correct if and only if the participant responds correctly to both comparison sentences. No partial credit is awarded. Therefore, if the response to the first trial is incorrect, the item is scored incorrect, and the standard sentence for the next item is presented. All responses were recorded on a computer hard drive.",
                        "Respondents are instructed to compare the standard and comparison sentences and indicate if the two sentences match (i.e., if the sentences have the same meaning). They are informed that any combination of \u2018Same\u2019 and \u2018Different\u2019 trials is possible, allowing for four potential response outcomes: S-D, D-S, D-D, and S-S. The test session begins after respondents demonstrate that they understand the task by successfully completing a set of 10 practice items. Examinees indicate whether the sentences presented in each trial are the \u2018same\u2019 or \u2018different,\u2019 by pressing a button on a response box, clicking a computer mouse or pressing a touch screen.",

Prespecification of the level of measurement accuracy or reliability required of respondents is built into the functionality of the adaptive testing software. As more test items are administered to a respondent, the accuracy (reliability) of the test score increases and so does the test administration time. Therefore, in practice, examiners need to determine an appropriate and desirable balance between the accuracy of test results and test administration time.",

The items are scaled along a continuum extending from low to high degrees of speech recognition difficulty, and the continuum of item difficulty generally reflects the listener's ability to perceive acoustic and phonetic properties of speech, such as phonetic features of place, manner and voicing. Since the test is administered by a software application, it may be delivered over the internet and/or self-administered by test takers. Importantly, the adaptive item selection procedure enhances measurement precision for individuals in comparison to conventional word recognition tests because of the systematic manner in which the up-down psychophysical method brackets the respondent's speech recognition ability level within progressively smaller ranges of measurement error. The standard error (se) determines the step size for the up-down procedure, and the NSRT\u00ae uses a setting of \u00b11.5 se as the default value.",

Specifically, the first item is empirically related to one or more of the following three variables: (1) prior performance on the NSRT\u00ae; (2) the respondent's age expressed in years; and (3) an indicator variable reflecting a respondent's perception of whether they suffer from a hearing impairment/handicap. Using equations derived from OLS regression techniques, these data are used to guide the NSRT\u00ae application where testing is to begin.",

The first stage of NSRT\u00ae testing, the routing test, proceeds until an examinee responds correctly and incorrectly to the items presented. To illustrate, the first item administered has, for example, di=0.25 logit. If the examinee responds correctly (incorrectly), an item of greater (lesser) difficulty is administered next. The increment (decrement), here 0.50 logit, remains fixed and constant at this stage of testing. Thus, the second item to be administered will be that item in the pool having difficulty closest to +0.75 or \u22120.75 logit depending on the response to the previous item. The fixed increment (decrement) is continued until at least one correct and one incorrect response have been observed.",

Thus, for individuals for whom both correct and incorrect responses have not been observed upon reaching the extremities of difficulty or easiness, NSRT\u00ae testing terminates with a message indicating that these individuals have speech recognition ability levels which are indeterminate. The maximum length of the routing test (M) was set at M=10 items at the onset of testing.",
                        "When at least one correct and one incorrect response to the NSRT\u00ae items have been observed for an individual, a finite maximum likelihood estimate of ability (bv), as well as its associated standard error se, is computed. This occurs in the second stage of testing. The numerical estimation method employed here possesses the property that an individual's number right or raw score is a sufficient statistic for estimation of the ability parameter.",
                        "Using the estimate of ability bv computed in the previous programming step, test items in the NSRT\u00ae pool that have not already been administered are evaluated for their potential to provide additional information about the examinee. Specifically, the next item to be administered will be that item which has di closest to bv, with the further condition that the difference between the ability estimate and the selected item's difficulty must be less than the standard error associated with the ability estimate. Otherwise, testing is terminated with a message that NSRT\u00ae items of appropriate difficulty have been exhausted.",
                        "After each newly selected test item is presented and the examinee's response is evaluated for correctness/incorrectness, the bv is revised, making use of the additional information. The revised bv is compared, as earlier, with the di of items remaining in the pool that have not already been administered. In this way, NSRT\u00ae items continue to be administered to an examinee as long as the difference between the item difficulty and each newly computed bv remains within a decreasing standard error of measurement.",

Each of these test termination criteria is set in advance by the examiner. For the NSRT\u00ae, testing is terminated after five minutes or 40 items, whichever occurs first in the testing session, or after a reliability of 0.90 has been attained.

Specifically, data obtained in the 2003 study found that performance on the NSRT\u00ae could be modeled in terms of a linear combination of four predictor variables that included high frequency pure tone average, speech reception/recognition threshold or SRT (a measure used by audiologists to corroborate pure tone average at frequencies 0.5, 1 and 2 kHz), age, and a self-report indicator variable reflecting respondents' perception whether they suffered from hearing impairment/handicap.

The method of claim 17, wherein after each newly selected test item is presented and the individual's response is evaluated for correctness/incorrectness, the bv is revised, making use of the additional information; the revised bv is compared with the di of items remaining that have not already been administered so that items continue to be administered to the individual as long as the difference between their difficulty and each newly computed bv remains within a decreasing standard error of measurement.",
        "19. The method of claim 7, wherein testing is terminated when: (1) the remaining items are of inappropriate difficulty; (2) the individual has responded to L items; (3) the testing session reaches a time limit; or (4) the individual has been tested to a predetermined level of precision or reliability.",
        "20. The method of claim 17, wherein item difficulty (di) and person ability (bv) estimates are on the same numerical scale, facilitating the selection of items of appropriate difficulty to estimate the individual's ability level and the associated standard error following the administration of each test item.",
        "21. The method of claim 7, wherein the acoustic and phonetic features comprise four categories of linguistic contrasts which comprise:\ncontrasts in place of articulation manifested within voiced and voiceless stop and fricative consonants comprising /p-t/, /p-k/, /t-k/, /b-d/, /b-g/, /d-g/, /f-s/, /f-\u222b/, /s-\u222b/, /\u03b8-s/, /\u03b8-\u222b/, /\u03b8-f/, /z-v/, /v-\u00f0/ and /z-\u00f0/, the location of place contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences comprising word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions; wherein sentence-initial position is the first phrase in a sentence; sentence-final position is the last phrase in a sentence; and sentence-medial position is all other locations within the sentence;\ncontrasts in manner of articulation are manifested within voiced and voiceless stop and fricative consonants produced at the labial and alveolar places of articulation comprising /t-s/, /t-\u222b/, /t-\u03b8/, /z-d/, /f-p/, /v-b/, and /d-\u00f0/, the location of manner contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences comprising word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions;\ncontrasts in voicing are manifested within voiced-voiceless cognates comprising stops and fricatives, and contrasts in vowels are manifested across the features of tongue height and tongue advancement, as well as tense-lax vowel pairs, wherein the location of these contrasts varies in serial position within words and within sentences comprising word- and sentence-initial, medial and final positions; and\ncontrasts in sentence prosody, comprising gross time-intensity variations in the speech waveform envelope combined with contrasts at the syllable and word levels, are manifested within phonological phrases, and their location varies within sentences.",
        "22. The method of claim 7, wherein the equation comprises:\n\n\nyj=bj0+bj1x1+bj2x2+bj3x3j=1-5{frequencies}\n\nwhere:\nx1=test measures obtained under quiet, noise or the average of both listening conditions;\nx2=chronological age expressed in years; and\nx3=self-report of perceived hearing ability."
