    "abstract": "This invention identifies important geometric parameters of an adhesive microfiber with mushroom-shaped tip for improving and optimizing adhesive ability. The magnitude of pull-off stress is dependent on a wedge angle \u03b3 and the ratio of the tip radius to the stalk radius \u03b2 of the mushroom-shaped fiber. Pull-off stress is also found to depend on a dimensionless parameter x, the ratio of the fiber radius to a length-scale related to the dominance of adhesive stress. Finally, the shape of edge tip, where the surface and sides of the mushroom-shaped tip join, is a factor that impacts strength of adhesion. Optimizing ranges for these parameters are identified.",

                        "We need to look no further than nature to find inspiration for many of the technologies we work on today. One such field that observations on natural systems have impacted significantly in the recent years is adhesive technologies. While conventional adhesives rely on very soft materials or viscous liquids, nature offers a unique system composed of adhesive elements made of relatively rigid materials. These adhesive elements are comprised of millions of tiny fibers varying in size and geometrical complexity depending on the animal that bears them. Some insects, spiders, and anoles have fibers with effective diameters in the order of microns. Other animals such as the gecko lizard bear micro-scale stalks which branch down to nano-scale fibers forming intricate hierarchical structures. The common aspect of fibrillar structuring is its ability to conform to the adhering surface, improve contact area and create an attractive force between individual fibers and the surface. The cumulative effect from the adhesion contribution of every fiber in contact is capable of generating adhesive strengths up to 100 kPa as measured in the case of the gecko lizard.",
                        "A great deal of research has been performed to analyze the structure of natural fibrillar adhesives and measure their performance, understand the main principles of enhanced adhesion, and fabricate synthetic counterparts of biological fiber adhesives.",
                        "A common aspect of natural fibers among species, which is of interest in this work, is that the cross section of a natural fiber is rarely constant along its length. It gradually increases close to its terminal end forming what is referred to as mushroom-shaped fibers. While initial fabrication attempts for synthetic adhesives were limited to constant cross section cylindrical fibers, realization of the actual shape of natural fibers has led to synthetic fibers with mushroom tips. Adhesives comprised of mushroom-shaped fibers have shown significant improvements over cylindrical fibers. Furthermore, measured adhesive strengths have matched and in some instances such as smooth surface applications surpassed adhesive strengths recorded for gecko footpads.",
                        "The force required to detach a mushroom-shaped fiber is greater than that of a cylindrical fiber because the contact area for a mushroom-shaped fiber is larger. Work by del Campo et al., Del Campo A., Greiner C., Arzt E. Langmuir 2007, 23, 10235-10243, reports enhancements in pull-off loads as much as 40-fold with mushroom-shaped fibers over cylindrical fibers of equal height and stalk radius. Interestingly, for mushroom-shaped fibers which exhibited this enhancement, the contact area is only 1.7 times the contact area of flat tip cylindrical fibers. This fact points to the existence of an adhesion enhancement mechanism other than just the increase in contact area with mushroom-shaped fibers.",
                        "In this invention, the pull-off stress of mushroom-shaped fibers using a cohesive zone model and finite elements (FE) simulations is examined. This model is then used to determine the optimal parameters for maximum pull-off stress. Two parameters are identified for design and optimization: the edge angle of the fiber tip \u03b3 and the ratio of the radius of the tip to the radius of the stalk \u03b2. In addition, the impact of the shape of the edge tip\u2014where the surface and sides of the mushroom tip intersect\u2014is evaluated and a preferred shape is identified.",
                        "While previous literature has described that microfibers with mushroom-shaped tips demonstrate enhanced adhesion when compared with cylindrical microfibers, there exists no understanding of what geometric parameters result in microfibers with optimized adhesion."

                        "The application refers to the following terms, words, and phrases that have particular meaning with regards to the present invention. A geometric feature being micro or microscale means that at least one of the characteristic lengths of the feature in any 3D direction should be between 0.5-500 micrometers in length. Microfibers are microscale hairs with at least one microscale feature on them.",
                        "Referring generally to FIG. 1, a two-dimensional axial symmetry model for one embodiment of the mushroom-shaped fiber 10 of the present invention is shown. Fiber 10 includes stem 11 and mushroom-shaped tip 12 with a flat surface 13. Stem 11 and tip 12 are symmetrical about symmetry axis 14, such that radius a of stem 11 (up to the point of connection with tip 12, in a preferred embodiment, is constant along the height of stem 11, and radius at of tip 12, in a preferred embodiment, is constant at surface 13 as well and is fixed in radial direction to simulate full-friction contact. FIG. 1 also shows height h, which is the distance between the bottom 15 of stem 11 and surface 13. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, surface 13 and the cross-section of stem 11 are circular. In other embodiments, however, an oval or elliptical shape and/or cross-section may be used. The shape of the inclined sides on the underside of the mushroom tip is linear is linear in a preferred embodiment, but can be alternately convex or concave with respect to the stem axial direction and tip surface.",
                        "In operation and use, fiber 10 attaches, adheres or otherwise is joined at bottom 15 to a base or substrate (not shown). Fiber 10 is substantially perpendicular to the base or substrate. As is known in the art, surface 13 has adhesive forces that allow fiber 10 to attach and/or adhere to other objects. The present invention addresses and describes optimum parameters of fiber 10 for maximizing the adhesive force at surface 13. These parameters focus, referring to FIG. 1, on (i) wedge angle \u03b3, (ii) the ratio \u03b2 of the radius at of the tip 12 to the radius a of the stem 11, and (iii) the sharpness or radius of curvature of the outer edge 16 formed by the surface 13 and the inclined sides 17 of the tip 12. In embodiments where at and a are not constant, the effective radius of surface 13 and/or of the cross-section of stem 11 is used. Similarly, where surface 13 is an oval or ellipse, the radius at is determined where at is smallest. In embodiments where sides 17 are not linear, that is, they are concave or convex, wedge angle \u03b3 is determined by using the line that is formed from edge 16 to the apex of the radius of curved side 17.",
                        "The height h of fiber 10 is not a controlling geometric parameter. This invention may be applied to microfibers or nanofibers currently in commercial use, including those with characteristic geometries ranging from 0.2-500 nm and 0.2-500 \u03bcm in length. As shown in FIG. 2 each fiber 10 is, in one embodiment, part of a microfiber array of synthetic polyurethane mushroom-shaped fibers of the present invention. In FIG. 2, the fibers have 4 \u03bcm stalk radius, 8 \u03bcm tip radius, and 20 \u03bcm length (Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm).",
                        "As detailed below, the pull-off stress at surface 13 is important in evaluating the adhesive forces at surface 13. In particular, pull-off stress for an individual mushroom-shaped fiber can be modelled using DB cohesive zone model and finite element (\u201cFE\u201d) analyses. These analyses reveal critical information about the detachment mechanism of mushroom-shaped fibers and how this behaviour is influenced by the geometry and interfacial properties of fiber, namely, optimal values for the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, as well as the shape of the edge angle. More directly, these analyses reveal geometrical guidelines to ensure optimal, i.e., high and robust, adhesion relative to the intrinsic adhesive stress.",
                        "More specifically, the adhesion mechanism of bio-inspired mushroom-shaped fibers is investigated by implementing the Dugdale-Barenblatt cohesive zone model into FE simulations. As detailed below, these simulation show that the magnitude of pull-off stress depends on the edge angle \u03b3 and the ratio of the tip radius to the stalk radius \u03b2 of the mushroom-shaped fiber. Pull-off stress is also found to depend on a dimensionless parameter x, the ratio of the fiber radius to a length-scale related to the dominance of adhesive stress. In this invention, \u03b2=1.1-1.2 and \u03b3=45\u00b0 are described as the optimal parameters for maximizing pull-off stress for a single mushroom-shaped fiber. In other embodiments of the invention, \u03b2 may range from 1.05 to 1.4 and \u03b3 may range from 20\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 for mushroom-shaped tips geometries which demonstrate improved adhesion with respect to a cylindrical microfiber. As further detailed below, in the discussion of crack initiation and a pull-off model, the location of crack initiation is found to depend on x for a given \u03b2 and \u03b3. An analytical model for pull-off stress, which depends on the location of crack initiation as well as \u03b3 and \u03b2, is proposed and found to agree with the simulation results. In the next discussion section, the simulation results are also substantiated by a pull-off stress comparison between mushroom-shaped and cylindrical fibers. Finally, the importance of the edge angle, as a parameter, is discussed.",
                        "Cohesive Zone Model.",
                        "As a starting point, adhesion problems between surface 13 and another object in contact with surface 13 were studied using a cohesive zone model such as the Dugdale-Barenblatt (DB) model. Dugdale D. S. J Mech Phys Solids 1960, 8, 100-104; Barenblatt G. I. Advances in Applied Mechanics (eds. H. L. Dryden T.v.K.G.K.F.H.v.d.D., Howarth L.) 1962, pp. 55-129, Elsevier. It is a simple cohesive zone model where the interface between surface 13 and the object in contact with surface 13 separates when the normal interfacial stress reaches the theoretical strength of the interface \u03c3o. The interface continues to separate at \u03c3o until the separation reaches a critical distance \u03b4c, after which the interface can no longer support stress, resulting in the initiation of a crack between surface 13 and the object in contact with surface 13. The region where the separation of interface occurs is referred to as the cohesive zone. In this model, the work of adhesion is given by \u03c9adh=\u03c3o\u03b4c. Tang et al. found the pull-off force of a soft, elastic cylindrical fiber in contact with a rigid flat surface whose height is much larger than its radius using the DB cohesive zone model. Tang T., Hui C. Y., Glassmaker N. J. J R Soc Interface 2005, 2, 505-516. According to this study, normalized pull-off stress \u03a6\u2261\u03c3s/\u03c3o depends on a single dimensionless parameter x defined as:",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{\\chi \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{o}^{2}\ue89e{a\ue8a0\\left( {1 - v^{2}} \\right)}}{2\ue89e\\pi \ue89e\\; \ue89e{Ew}_{adh}}} = {\\frac{\\sigma_{o}\ue89e{a\ue8a0\\left( {1 - v^{2}} \\right)}}{2\ue89e\\pi \ue89e\\; \ue89eE\ue89e\\; \ue89e\\delta_{c}}.}} & (1)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "Here, a is the radius, E is the elastic modulus, and \u03bd is the Poisson's ratio of the fiber\u2014which all can be measured for a particular fiber size and material. Work of adhesion, \u03c9adh, is also a measurable quantity. Critical separation distance, \u03b4c, is derived from van der Waals interactions. It is the distance between two flat surfaces when the interfacial attractive stress is the highest and it is usually assumed to be in the range 0.1 nm-1 nm. According to DB model, work of adhesion is the product of intrinsic adhesive strength and the critical separation distance. The intrinsic adhesive strength, \u03c3o, can be calculated using work of adhesion and the critical separation distance. The magnitude of intrinsic adhesive strength is limited by the Young's modulus (E) of the material for soft materials (materials with E up to 10 MPa) due to stress blunting and thermal fluctuations.",
                        "Dimensionless parameter x is the ratio of the fiber radius to a length scale related to the dominance of the interfacial adhesive forces. Hence, when x<<1, an attractive stress that is equal to the intrinsic adhesive stress covers the entire fiber tip and pull-off stress approaches the theoretical limit, \u03a6=1 (i.e. \u03c3s=\u03c3o). This regime is referred to as the flaw insensitive regime. On the other hand, when x<<1, \u03c3o acts over a small portion of the interface, which results in pull-off stress being much smaller than the theoretical limit, \u03c3s<<\u03c3o. This regime is referred to as the flaw sensitive regime. The non-dimensional parameter x is also relevant to the adhesion problem of mushroom-shaped fibers. Thus, pull-off results can be presented as a function of x, and a pull-off stress model based on x is presented below.",
                        "FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b) show the results of the simulations performed for a mushroom-shaped fiber illustrated in FIG. 1 using COMSOL MultiPhysics 4.3 FE analysis software. In these simulations, it is assumed that the surface 13 of fiber 10 is in full friction contact with a rigid smooth surface of another object. The DB cohesive zone model was implemented at the tip of the fiber in FE simulations and modified slightly to avoid divergence. Step function from zero stress to \u03c3o in the cohesive zone was replaced with a high stiffness relation between the attractive stress and interfacial opening where the interface is required to separate by 10% of \u03b4c before cohesive zone forms (i.e., before \u03c3o is reached). Aksak B., Hui C. Y., Sitti M. J R Soc Interface 2011, 8, 1166-1175. Unless stated otherwise, the simulation parameters are a=1 \u03bcm, E=3 MPa, \u03bd=0.5, and \u03c3o=100 kPa. In the simulation, the tip radius at varies from 1.05 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm while the edge angle \u03b3 varies from 25\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. It is important to note that the tip edge or corner 16 forms a wedge with a wedge angle that is also equal to \u03b3. The effect of wedge angle of edge 16 being different from \u03b3 is addressed below in the discussion of the impact of the edge angle. The height of the fiber h is fixed at 10 \u03bcm. Dimensionless parameter x is varied by changing \u03b4c for fixed at, E, \u03bd, and \u03c3o. While applying displacement \u0394 gradually to the base of the fiber, pull-off load is determined from the far field tensile stress \u03c3ff the fiber bears when the maximum interfacial separation equals \u03b4c. The tensile load reaches its maximum at the instant \u03b4c is reached at the interface as shown in FIG. 3(a). Knowing pull-off load ps, pull-off stress is calculated from \u03c3s=ps/(\u03c0at2).",
                        "Peaks in each plot for specific \u03b3 coincide and correspond to normalized pull-off stress \u03a6. Tensile load drops immediately after the maximum interfacial separation reaches the critical separation indicating that the contact is unstable following crack initiation. As shown in FIG. 3(b), the discontinuity at \u03b4m/\u03b4c\u02dc0.1 prior to crack initiation marks the instant when a cohesive zone starts to form.",
                        "Pull-off stress for all tip-to-base ratios \u03b2\u2261at/a and edge angles \u03b3 are shown for select x values in FIGS. 4(a)-(d). Contour plots show clear peaks at \u03b2=1.1-1.2 and \u03b3=45\u00b0 suggesting that these values are optimal for maximum pull-off stress. In addition, the peak pull-off stress drops with increasing x with highest value at \u03a6=0.97 for x=5 and lowest value at \u03a6=0.88 for x=40 both obtained for \u03b2=1.1 and \u03b3=45\u00b0.",
                        "FIG. 5(a) shows pull-off stress for \u03b2=1.1 for all \u03b3 as a function of x. In line with the data presented in FIGS. 4(a)-(d), \u03b3=45\u00b0 yields the highest pull-off stress for all x, except when x<<1 (shown at the left of FIG. 5(a). In the regime where x<<1, pull-off is flaw insensitive, and it is expected that \u03a6=1 regardless of \u03b2, \u03b3, and x.",
                        "FIG. 5(a) further shows that for \u03b3\u226645\u00b0, pull-off stress saturates towards a constant value as x increases. In contrast for \u03b3>45\u00b0, pull-off stress continuously drops with increasing x. The dependence of pull-off stress on the wedge angle at the limit \u03c7\u2192\u221d (i.e. \u03b4c\u21920) is reinforced using Bogy's study on stress singularities at bimaterial wedge interfaces. Carbone G., Pierro E., Gorb S. N. Soft Matter 2011, 7, 5545-5552. For a soft incompressible elastomer (i.e., Poisson's ratio, \u03bd=0.5) in contact with a rigid substrate, stress at the edge of the fiber tip is finite for \u03b3\u226645\u00b0 and singular for \u03b3>45\u00b0. Stress profiles of a mushroom-shaped fiber with \u03b2=1.1 and \u03b3={25\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 80\u00b0 } are shown for a far field displacement of \u0394/h=0.0217 in FIG. 5(b). Due to the singularity, a cohesive zone is present at the edge of the fiber both for \u03b3=60\u00b0 and \u03b3=80\u00b0 while cohesive zone has not formed, as yet, for \u03b3=25\u00b0 and \u03b3=45\u00b0. Assuming that \u03b4c=0, this implies that pull-off will occur shortly after the maximum tensile stress at the interface reaches \u03c3o. If there is a stress singularity at the edge of the tip, normal stress will be equal to \u03c3o at the edge the moment a tensile load is applied to the fiber. The interface will open starting at the edge and pull-off will depend on whether this opening is less than or equal to \u03b4c. On the other hand, if stress is finite everywhere at the interface, a sufficiently large tensile load has to be applied before a cohesive zone starts forming. This implies that regardless of the value of \u03b4c, pull-off load has a finite lower limit when \u03b3\u226645\u00b0. The existence of this lower limit provides robust adhesion because regardless of the value of x, one can expect to obtain pull-off stress equal to at least this lower. In particular for fibers with \u03b3=45\u00b0 and \u03b2=1.1-1.2, this lower limit for normalized pull-off stress is remarkably \u03a6=0.85 which ensures high and robust adhesion. Stated differently, these results demonstrate that, no matter what the interfacial values may be, 85% of intrinsic adhesive strength can be recovered if there is not singularity present. Thus confirming that optimum adhesion can be obtained at \u03b3=45\u00b0.",
                        "FIGS. 4(a)-(d) and 5(a) and (b), together, show preferred values for \u03b3 and \u03b2 when x ranges from 1 to 100. In particular, within this range for x, normalized pull-off stress of 0.7-0.9 is observed where the ratio of at/a is 1.05-1.4, and wedge angle \u03b3 is 20-55. In the same range, pull-off stress of 0.8-0.9 is observed where the ratio of at/a is 1.1-1.2, and wedge angle \u03b3 is 40-50.

                        "Crack Initiation and Pull-Off Model.",
                        "The location of crack initiation (i.e. where the interface opening equals \u03b4c) is also dependent both on tip shape parameters \u03b3 and \u03b2, and the value of x. For \u03b3\u226645\u00b0, since normal stress is finite everywhere at the tip, the cohesive zone forms when and where the maximum normal stress reaches \u03c3o. This location corresponds to r/a=0 (center) for \u03b3=45\u00b0 and all \u03b2 [refer to FIG. 5(b) for normal stress profiles]. Simulation results show that the location of crack initiation is independent of x for this set of tip parameters. For \u03b3>45\u00b0 on the other hand, the crack initiation is always at the edge for sufficiently large x. For certain combinations of \u03b2 and \u03b3, for instance \u03b2=1.4 and \u03b3=60\u00b0, although the normal stress at the tip is highest at the edge, it does not increase monotonically from the center to the edge of the tip. Stress profile has a minimum at r/a\u02dc1 [FIG. 5(b)]. For sufficiently low x, gradually increasing far field displacement causes a cohesive zone to form at the edge first. Since \u03b4c is relatively large for low x, an increase in tension does not immediately result in a crack to initiate at the edge. In the meantime, the stress in the center gradually increases reaching \u03c3o where a second cohesive zone starts to form. The center separates faster than the edge which results in a crack to initiate at the center. The simulations, therefore, lead to the conclusion that crack initiation switches to the center of the fiber if stress at the center is able to reach \u03c3o prior to a crack initiating at the edge.",

                        "For x<<1, i.e., for very small fiber radius (typically less than 1 \u03bcm), pull-off stress equals intrinsic adhesive stress and is insensitive to the tip shape. This is in agreement with the simulation results outlined above. However, for large x, tip shape significantly affects adhesion. del Campo et al. measured pull-off loads for mushroom-shaped fibers and cylindrical fibers of the same height; stalk radius and packing density. While this study measured approximately 0.7 mN for cylindrical fibers with a hemispherical glass indenter, the measured pull-off load was approximately 28 mN with mushroom-shaped fibers, an enhancement of 40-fold. Reported values are approximate pull-off loads near saturation as interpreted from the graphical data presented in del Campo et al. An enhancement factor e can be defined as the ratio of the pull-off load between two different fiber arrays. For an experiment that uses hemispherical glass indenter with a radius much larger than the dimensions of an individual fiber in the array, the enhancement factor of mushroom-shaped fibers over the cylindrical fibers with the same packing density, stalk radius, height, and material becomes:",

                        "Here, Pm and Pc are the pull-off loads for the mushroom-shaped and cylindrical fiber arrays, respectively. The del Campo et al experiments were carried out with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cylindrical and mushroom-shaped fibers. For cylindrical fibers, a=10 \u03bcm and h=25 \u03bcm. The tip radius for mushroom-shaped fibers were at=13 \u03bcm and they shared the same a and h with the cylindrical fibers. For both samples, the packing densities (number of fibers per unit area) were the same. According to the model of the present invention, \u03b2=1.3 and although the edge angle was not reported in the del Campo et al work, \u03b3=45\u00b0 is assumed for simplicity. For \u03b2=1.3 and \u03b3=45\u00b0, a conservative estimate of normalized pull-off stress according to the model of the present invention is \u03c3s,m=\u0393c\u03c3c=0.74\u03c3o. For cylindrical fibers, \u03c3s,c=0.83x\u22120.4\u03c3o as shown by Tang et al. For the described fiber arrays, equation (3) becomes e=2.27\u03c70.8. If PDMS is assumed to be incompressible (\u03bd=0.5) with elastic modulus E=1.42 MPa, for glass-PDMS contact, \u03c9adh=25 mJ/m2. If an intrinsic adhesive stress of \u03c3o=1 MPa is also assumed (a reasonable value for PDMS), plugging in the material properties, interfacial properties and fiber dimensions into equation (1), one finds x=33.6, and, in turn, e=38. This estimate is close to e=40 that del Campo et al. obtained in their measurements.",
                        "Implication of Edge Angle.",
                        "The manufacturing technique used to fabricate mushroom-shaped fibers may not yield a sharp edge or corner (i.e. wedge) for individual fibers at the edge 16 of the tip. This implies that the wedge angle will be different from the angle of edge 16 defined in this work which may significantly affect the pull-off stress. To demonstrate this effect, simulations for mushroom-shaped fibers were performed with \u03b2=1.2 and \u03b3=45\u00b0 employing three different edge shapes; namely 45\u00b0 edge, 90\u00b0 edge and rounded edge, as shown in FIG. 7(a). The radius of curvature was set to 10 nm for the rounded edge. In case of the 90\u00b0 edge, a 10 nm high rectangle was added to the tip. For all three cases, the size of the tip in contact was kept at 1.2 \u03bcm ensuring constant \u03b2=1.2. As shown in FIG. 7(b), the shape of the edge angle has significant effect on pull-off stress for relatively high x values where a crack initiates at the edge 16 for both the rounded and 90\u00b0 edge. Below a critical x where a crack initiation transitions to the center, pull-off stress for all three cases follow the same path once a crack is initiated at the center indicating little dependence on edge angle. Thus, a qualitative argument suggests that while fibers with small diameters and high elastic modulus (large x) favor edge angle independence, the dependence of pull-off stress to the edge angle is less significant for high strength interfaces (small x). This is assuming that the critical separation distance is in the order of 1 nm and somewhat constant for van der Waals interactions.",
                        "In practical application, the fiber material and manufacturing process provide limitations on the ability to obtain a true sharp angle for edge 16. Wetting properties also impact this process, with wetting allowing for sharper edges. In a preferred embodiment, wetted polymer materials are used to maximize the sharpness of the edge 16. However, materials and manufacturing limitations will still provide some radius of curvature. A preferred radius of curvature for maximum sharpness in this preferred embodiment is less than or equal to 10 nm. For other materials, maximum sharpness, with the smallest radius of curvature possible\u2014given the material, wetting properties and manufacturing process\u2014is preferred in order to optimize the edge shape parameter. In these cases, microfibers with a sharpness of the edge 16 with radius of curvature of 0.1 nm up to 10 \u03bcm will still demonstrate stronger adhesion when compared with microfibers with larger edge 16 radius of curvature.",
                        "In summary, pull-off stress for an individual mushroom-shaped fiber was modelled using DB cohesive zone model and FE analyses. This study revealed critical information about the detachment mechanism of mushroom-shaped fibers and how this behaviour is influenced by the geometry as well as the interfacial properties. A simple geometrical guideline to ensure high and robust adhesion relative to the intrinsic adhesive stress was offered. While these results are important for designing dry fibrillar adhesives, they are only concerned with the performance when the loading is in the axial direction of fibers. The effect of shear loading should also be considered along with the results of this study in designing fibrillar adhesives.",

These materials with high adhesion surfaces have value across a broad range of industries and markets. This invention will add value to any microfiber-based adhesive with mushroom tip shape by increasing the adhesive ability of each microfiber, resulting in a product capable of stronger adhesion per unit area. This increase in adhesion will enable access to new product markets where stronger interfacial adhesion strength is required.

The resulting performance enhancement made possible by the invention reduces the input material required to manufacture each unit of adhesion, and thus the cost of producing mushroom-based microfiber adhesives is also reduced. These cost savings can be passed on to consumers, resulting in a product which can be more competitively priced than competing suboptimal adhesives. This performance optimization also results in reduced shipping costs per unit of adhesion, as well as reduced packaging costs, additionally enhancing the competitive price advantage made possible by this invention. These optimized adhesives also allow access to applications where space constraints are critical, where suboptimal adhesives may not be able to provide the necessary adhesive strength for an established product size",
