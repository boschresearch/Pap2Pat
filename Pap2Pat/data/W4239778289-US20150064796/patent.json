    "abstract": "A non-invasive method of detecting or screening for lung cancer in a subject specimen is provided. The method includes detecting elevated levels of one or more carbonyl-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are biomarkers for lung cancer in exhaled breath from the subject specimen. The method may further include obtaining exhaled breath from the subject specimen; forming adducts of the carbonyl-containing VOCs with a reactive chemical compound; quantifying the adducts of the carbonyl-containing VOCs to establish a subject value for each of the adducts; and comparing each subject value to a threshold healthy specimen value for each of the adducts of the carbonyl-containing VOCs. One or more subject values at quantities greater than threshold healthy specimen values are also useful for screening for lung cancer in the subject specimen.",

                        "Lung cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, but early detection of lung cancer is a key factor for increasing survival rates of lung cancer patients. Currently, CT and bronchoscopy are the principal techniques used for lung cancer detection by identifying pulmonary nodules, which if certain predetermined criteria are met are then invasively biopsied to determine the pathology of the nodule(s). A recent U.S. National Lung Screening trial found that periodic computerized tomography (CT) screening of heavy smokers could reduce lung cancer mortalities by as much as 20%. However, this benefit is offset by the morbidity, cost, and occasional mortality incurred by pursuing nonmalignant pulmonary nodules and adenopathy. Thus, with the advent and increasing acceptance of computerized tomography (CT) scan screening for lung cancer, the importance of distinguishing benign from malignant intrathoracic disease is ever increasing. Accordingly, it is important to develop reliable methods that minimize the diagnostic burden to patients who have no significant disease while expediting treatment in patients who actually have lung cancer.",
                        "In recent years, the analysis of exhaled breath has become an international research frontier because of its applicability for noninvasive health diagnoses. Several approaches have been developed to analyze exhaled breath including the use of sensor arrays, proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to name a few. Although some VOCs in exhaled breath have been reported as potential lung cancer biomarkers, there has been no clinical adoption of breath analysis methods for diagnosis because of the lack of cancer specific VOC markers for reliably predicting lung cancer disease state.",
                        "Moreover, analyzing exhaled breath for cancer-indicating biomarkers, i.e., excreted metabolic products, is a daunting task, insofar as over 1700 endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been identified in human breath. Additionally, many of these endogenous VOCs are present in exhaled breath in quantities that are less than the experimental error of the detection methods that are used to detect and/or identify them. For example, many of the VOCs in breath range from only a few parts per trillion (ppt) to a few parts per billion (ppb) concentration; many chemical species in breath samples are at millions-fold higher concentration than prevalent VOCs, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, which may need to be removed to avoid swamping most analytical instruments. Additionally, breath is a chemically-diverse mixture containing analogue/homologue/isomeric mixtures of alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes, which complicate the identification of disease biomarkers; and VOCs in breath may include non-metabolic constituents, which may introduce false biomarkers in breath analysis.",
                        "Thus, in order to efficiently and accurately analyze VOCs in breath so as to detect or identify a disease state, there are multiple hurdles to overcome. The first hurdle to overcome is that of concentrating the VOCs of interest. General approaches to concentrating one or more VOCs of interest from dilute gaseous samples have focused on one of the following: chemical, cryogenic, and adsorptive methods. The second hurdle is identifying specific relationships between biomarker(s) and/or quantities of specific biomarkers, which can be correlated with a high level of certainty to the presence of the disease state, with a low chance of false-negatives.",
                        "Therefore, in view of the shortcomings and challenges with conventional methods of detecting/identifying and screening for lung cancer, there is a need for new non-invasive methods."

Neutral chemical conjugates, such as those that can be obtained using tertiary amine reactive chemical compounds according to general Formula (III) are amenable to analysis using GC-MS. One beneficial feature of the tertiary amine reactive chemical compounds is their capability to be protonated with acid and form a positive charge, which is especially well-suited for analysis by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), discussed below. By comparing FT-ICR-MS and GC-MS results, all ketones and aldehydes adducts can generally be identified and/or quantified. It should be appreciated that other analytical techniques, e.g., laser spectroscopy, etc., may also be useful toward quantifying the biomarker adducts.

This exceptionally high sensitivity enables detection limits in the femtomole to attomole ranges. This sensitivity is orders of magnitude better than even the most sensitive GC-MS, which generally requires 100-1,000 femtomoles or more for detection. Moreover, because the VOCs are rendered non-volatile, the final analytical solution can be concentrated (e.g., to dryness) and taken up by a very small amount of solvent. Additionally, nanoelectrospray FTMS only needs a few microliters of sample volume.",

Carbonyl-containing VOCs are produced in biochemical pathways as intermediates, and some can be unique to a given pathway, such as lipid oxidation induced by free radicals. Therefore, the investigation focused on identification of carbonyl-containing VOC lung cancer biomarkers in exhaled breath using the silicon microreactor chemical preconcentrator technology that we previously developed for capture and analysis of trace carbonyl VOC in air and exhaled breath.",

The AGC (automatic gain control) maximum ion time was set to 500 ms (but typically utilized <10 ms) and five \u201c\u03bcscans\u201d were acquired for each saved spectrum; thus the cycle time for each transformed and saved spectrum was about 10 seconds. FT-ICR mass spectra were exported as exact mass lists into a spreadsheet file using QualBrowser 2.0 (Thermo Electron), typically exporting all of the observed peaks.

Carbonyl-containing VOCs from C1 (formaldehyde) to C12 in the exhaled breath samples of the healthy subjects and the patients with pulmonary nodules have been detected.",
                                "It was further demonstrated that the identified specific carbonyl-containing VOC biomarkers were not related to smoking. Moreover, it was demonstrated a high specificity and sensitivity for early lung cancer as differentiated from benign pulmonary disease. Furthermore, in comparison to PET scanning, similar sensitivity for the diagnosis of lung cancer was demonstrated but greater specificity in identifying benign disease instead of lung cancer, thereby potentially avoiding invasive procedures on patients who never had cancer.",

A total of 107 subject patients had lung cancer and 40 had benign pulmonary disease. The FT-ICR-MS spectra of the first ten lung cancer patients were carefully reviewed and compared to the normal controls (i.e., healthy subject volunteers). In this sudy four carbonyl compounds, which were present at elevated levels in the lung cancer patients, were characterized as lung cancer biomarkers and further studied prospectively in the remaining patients. They were 2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, and 4-hydroxy-2-hexanal (4-HHE). Although, on average, these select four compounds were all significantly elevated in the cancer group compared to the healthy control population (P values each <0.0001), there was overlap in the range of values in the two groups.",

A pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer was confirmed in 107 patients, and benign nodules in 40 patients. Five patients were clinically diagnosed with benign pulmonary nodules based on the shrinkage of nodule size for at least six months after the collection of breath samples. The 107 lung cancer patients were comprised of 8 with SCLC, 97 with NSCLC, 1 combined small and non-small cell lung cancer, and 1 carcinoid tumor.",

The acetaldehyde concentration (ATM-C2H4O in FIG. 3B) is the highest among healthy smokers, likely due to its abundance in cigarette smoke. Healthy nonsmokers typically have acetone (ATM-C3H6O in FIG. 3C) as the most concentrated carbonyl compound in their exhaled breath. FIG. 3 also shows that a lung cancer patient has obvious higher concentrations of 2-butanone and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (ATM-C4H8O2, Mw=189.15982) (FIG. 3A) than the healthy smoker (FIG. 3B) and nonsmoker (FIG. 3C). The Wilcoxon statistical test indicated that the concentrations of 2-butanone (p<0.0001), 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (p<0.0001), 2-hydroxyacetaldehye (p<0.0001), and 4-HHE (p<0.0005) were significantly higher in the exhaled breath samples of the group of lung cancer patients than in the healthy control group. The identified VOCs of lung cancer in exhaled breath samples were confirmed by FT-ICR-MS/MS using the same compounds ordered from Sigma-Aldrich and Cayman Inc. as standard references. The concentration ranges of these four VOCs for the group of the healthy controls, the group of the patients with lung cancer and the group of the patients with benign pulmonary nodules are presented in Table 2.",

Notably, 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, and 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde are present in ambient air. However, the concentrations of these three VOCs in air were at least 10 times lower than were found in exhaled breath. In addition, 4-HHE was not detected in air. The effects of tidal breath or environmental air on the concentrations of these carbonyl VOCs in exhaled breath samples can be neglected. Therefore, it was surmised that these carbonyl species are primarily from alveolar breath and their concentrations increase with cancer presence.",

All patients (n=29) exhaling the four carbonyl VOCs at concentrations indicative of lung cancer were diagnosed with lung cancer while 34 out of 35 patients exhaling 3 carbonyl VOCs at concentrations indicative of lung cancer were diagnosed with lung cancer. There were two cancer patients without any of the four carbonyl VOCs at concentrations indicative of lung cancer. By defining a simple and practical diagnostic rule of an elevation of at least two of the four carbonyl VOCs as indicative of lung cancer, a sensitivity of 89.8% and a specificity of 81.3% was obtained. Although these results are very promising for clinical application, testing a much larger number of patients with pulmonary nodules in order to develop an even more reliable method for diagnosis of lung cancer could be advantageous.",
                                "To determine whether the carbonyl-containing VOC lung cancer biomarkers could be related to lung cancer stages, the concentrations of 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE in 34 patients with stage I, 16 patients with stage II, 24 patients with stage III, and 11 patients with stage IV of NSCLC were also analyzed by the Wilcoxon test. The concentrations of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE did not appear to be related to lung cancer stages. However, as shown in FIG. 4A, the concentration of 2-butanone can be related to stage I lung cancer. The concentration of 2-butanone in the exhaled breath samples of patients with stage I lung cancer was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls and the patients with benign pulmonary nodules, but lower than that in the patients with stages II to IV lung cancer. There does not appear to be a significant difference in 2-butanone concentrations in patients with stage II through IV lung cancer.",
                                "To determine potential existence of relationships between these carbonyl-containing VOC lung cancer biomarkers and the cancer histology of NSCLC, further analysis was performed for the concentrations of the four VOC biomarkers in 33 patients with adenocarcinomas, 32 patients with squamous cell carcinomas, and 15 patients with either poorly differentiated NSCLC or a combination of two types of NSCLC (labeled as ONSCLC in FIG. 4B). The patients with squamous cell carcinomas have significantly higher concentrations of 4-HHE than the patients with adenocarcinomas (p=0.03) (FIG. 4B). However, no significant difference was observed in the concentrations of 4-HHE between the group of adenocarcinomas and ONSCLC group. And no significant difference was observed in the concentrations of 4-HHE in the different stages of either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma patients (FIG. 6).",
                                "In order to use breath analysis results for future diagnosis of patients with SCLC, the concentrations of all carbonyl VOCs in breath samples of 5 patients with limited stage SCLC and 4 patients with advanced stage SCLC were analyzed and compared with the patients (n=88) with NSCLC. There was no significant difference in the concentrations of 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE in the SCLC patients when compared to the NSCLC patient group (FIG. 7). However, FIG. 5 shows that there is a significant increase in the concentrations of 4-HNE (p<0.0001) and C5H10O (p=0.0001) for the SCLC patients. GC-MS analysis was used to determine that C5H10O in exhaled breath was a mixture of 2-pentanone and pentanal. 4-HNE is one of the most studied unsaturated aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation and recent evidence has pointed to an inflammatory origin as a possible trigger of lung cancer development. Both 4-HHE and 4-HNE are recognized as products of lipid peroxidation, which could be induced by dysregulations of lung cancer. Accordingly, in addition to 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE, 4-HNE and C5H10O may also be useful carbonyl-containing VOC biomarkers for diagnosing, staging, and/or identifying histology of lung cancer disease states.",
                                "To validate that elevated concentrations of 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE can be used for diagnosis of NSCLC in early stages (I and II), exhaled breath samples obtained from 15 patients with stage I and II NSCLC, before and after resection of the cancer, were analyzed and compared. Before resection, the profile of the carbonyl-containing VOC biomarker panel was that of a typical lung cancer patient (i.e., similar to FIG. 3A), and the concentrations of the noted VOCs were in the elevated ranges indicative of lung cancer. After cancer resection and a period of at least two weeks following the surgery, the VOC profile in exhaled breath was similar to that of healthy controls (as shown in FIG. 8), and the concentrations of the four VOC lung cancer biomarkers were in ranges of healthy controls.",
                                "In conclusion, using a silicon microreactor coated with ATM, four carbonyl-containing VOCs in exhaled breath have been identified that when at elevated concentrations reliably diagnose lung cancer. Specifically, the concentrations of 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-hydroxyacetaldehye, and 4-HHE in breath are readily quantified by FT-ICR-MS analysis of the respective ATM-VOC adducts, and elevated concentrations of these adducts relative to concentrations in healthy patients, or even patients with benign pulmonary nodules, indicate the presence of lung cancer. The concentration of 2-butanone can be used to distinguish stage I lung cancer from stages II through IV. Furthermore, the concentration of 4-HHE may be used to distinguish squamous cell carcinoma from adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC, and the concentrations of 4-HNE and C5H10O can be used to distinguish SCLC patients from NSCLC patients. These findings have immediate application as an accurate, noninvasive means for the diagnosis of lung cancer. Further study may show that they are an effective means of early detection of lung cancer in conjunction with CT scanning and in monitoring for the recurrence of lung cancer post resection.",
                                "A method for determining the risk of malignancy was derived by counting the number of elevated lung cancer biomarkers in a given patient. An elevated marker was defined as being higher than the range of the control population for that marker. The results between patients with benign disease and those with early and late stage cancer were compared. If three or four lung cancer biomarkers were elevated in the exhaled breath sample of the subject patient, there was about a 95% chance that the patient had cancer. Conversely, if none or only one of the lung cancer biomarkers was elevated, the probability of benign disease was 85%. Sensitivity and specificity were greater than 80%, if two, three, or four of the lung cancer biomarkers were elevated. These results were true and consistent for both early and late stage lung cancer. These results demonstrated that exhaled breath analysis could distinguish early lung cancer from benign disease that appear to be radiographically similar.",
                                "Moreover, comparing exhaled breath analysis (BA) to PET scan in the diagnosis of early stage lung cancer verses benign disease in 81 patients, breath analysis had similar sensitivity (83% BA, 90% PET) but greater specificity (74% BA, 39% PET). Thus, exhaled breath analysis was overall found to be more accurate than PET in the diagnosis of lung cancer.",
                                "**Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Analysis**",
                                "FIGS. 9-11 show the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of 9 carbonyl compounds detected in exhaled breath for distinguishing lung cancer patients against a comparison subject group. ROC curves are graphic representations of the relation existing between the sensibility and the specificity of a test, and it is generated by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the total actual positives versus the fraction of false positives out of the total actual negatives. In FIG. 9, the ROC curve is shown for the assessment of 107 patients with lung cancer as compared to 40 patients with benign pulmonary nodules. In FIG. 10, the ROC curve is shown for the assessment of 107 patients with lung cancer as compared to 43 healthy non-smoker controls. And in FIG. 11, the ROC curve is shown for the assessment of 107 patients with lung cancer as compared to 45 healthy smoker controls. There are various packages in R for creating ROC curves, but the results presented herein utilized Caret R package, version 5.15-023. (See Kuhn M. \u201cCaret: Classification and Regression Training\u201d R package version 5.15-023, 2012.) Sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) are compared for 9 carbonyl compounds. Based on the present study, 2-butanone, a mixture of 2-pentanone and pentanal, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone appear to show higher specificity for use as a single marker for distinguishing lung cancer patients from benign pulmonary nodule patients. 3-Hydroxy-2-butanone and 2-butanone achieve higher than 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity for distinguishing lung cancer from benign pulmonary nodules, non-smoker and smoker controls.",
                                "Table 4 provides threshold (cutoff) values (expressed in units of nanomole per liter of exhaled breath) for six of the nine carbonyl-containing VOC biomarkers that may be used for a single species screening for lung cancer. The sensitivities of the carbonyl-containing VOC biomarker are also shown. The confidence level (sensitivity for lung cancer) using 2-butanone and 3-hydroxy-2-butaone for screening lung cancer from non-smoker and smoker groups were about 85%. Using C5 carbonyl compounds (a mixture of pentanal and 2-pentanone), the sensitivity is about 80%, whereas the sensitivities of 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal are about 62%, about 67%, and about 72%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity are dependent on the cutoff (threshold) concentrations of each individual marker.",
                                "Thus in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a non-invasive method of screening for a lung cancer disease state in a subject specimen is provided. The method comprises detecting a level of one or more carbonyl-containing VOCs that are biomarkers for lung cancer in exhaled breath from the subject specimen, and identifying the subject specimen as having a greater than 60% likelihood of the lung cancer disease state if the level of one or more of the carbonyl-containing VOCs is elevated above its respective threshold value. As shown in Table 4, the sensitivity may be increased by using a different VOC biomarker. It should be further noted that in this study only 5 lung cancer subjects had no elevated biomarkers, whereas 102 lung cancer subjects had at least one elevated biomarkers listed in Table 4. According, screening a subject specimen for at least one elevated level of a biomarker selected from Table 4 showed a sensitivity of about 95%.",
