Stainless steel carriers, used as reference, were cleaned and sterilized by immersion in a 75% ethanol solution followed by rinsing with deionized water. Vials containing Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) bacterial stock culture were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. 20 \u03bcL aliquots of thawed bacterial cultures were added to 10 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (Teknova). These bacterial suspensions were serially incubated 3 times at 36\u00b0 C. for 18-24 hours in an orbital shaker (New Brunswick Scientific), and then 1 time in polypropylene snap tubes (Fisher Healthcare) for 48 hours. Cultures were subsequently mixed on a vortex mixer (VWR Scientific) and allowed to settle. The upper two thirds of suspension from each tube was aspirated and OD600 was measured (Smart Spec Spectrophotometer 3000, Bio-Rad) to estimate bacterial density. The culture was diluted with phosphate buffer saline (Gibco Life Technologies) to achieve a bacterial inoculum concentration near a target value of 1.0\u00d7107 CFU/mL. 0.25 mL of 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco Life Technologies) and 0.05 mL Triton X-100 (Amresco Pro Pure) were added to 4.70 mL bacterial suspension to aid in spreading the inoculum. Each test coupon was inoculated with 20 \u03bcL of the bacterial test culture. The inoculum volume was spread evenly using bent sterile pipette tips (Mettler-Toledo) to ensure full and even coverage, spreading as close to the edge of the coupon as possible. Coupons were then incubated in a controlled environment set at 42% relative humidity and 23\u00b0 C. for a period of 120 min. Following the 120-minute exposure period, coupons were neutralized in Letheen broth (Gen Lab). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the neutralized solutions were plated using standard spread plate technique on Tryptic Soy Agar plates and incubated for 24 hours at 36\u00b0 C. to yield countable numbers of survivors (approximately 20-200 colonies per plate). Log and percentage of reductions for bactericidal efficacy tests measure differences in CFUs between stainless steel and test material (e.g., glass) containing coupons. For the surface to be considered a sanitizer, a greater than or equal to 99.9% reduction (at least 3 log reduction) must be demonstrated.",
                        "According to an exemplary aspect, both glass and glass-ceramic materials disclosed herein were sanitizers. As an example, a 3 log reduction equals about 99.9% of the microbes killed, shown as a diamond in the ternary diagram of FIG. 1 and identified as \u201cBHB\u201d and \u201cBHE.\u201d Other samples in the ternary had antimicrobial properties, with kill rates above zero and less than 25% (asterisk in FIG. 1) kill rates between 50 and 75% (letter \u201c0\u201d in FIG. 1), and between 75 and 99.9% (plus symbol in FIG. 1). Put another way, compositions in the Fe2O3\u2014CuO\u2014P2O5 ternary system are disclosed herein that display a range of antimicrobial behavior from virtually no effect to full kill. In embodiments, the materials can be fully amorphous and/or single-phase materials, or phase-separated and/or partially crystalline. Compositions with particularly effective antimicrobial properties (e.g., 3 log reduction or better) are shown in the ternary and include, in terms of % mol constituents, 40 to 55 CuO, 5 to 10 Fe2O3, and 35 to 50 P2O5, some of which are fully amorphous, single-phase glass and others of which are phase separated glass and/or glass-ceramic.",
                        "Amorphous microstructure may be advantageous for applications that require bulk parts because machining may be much easier than for compositions that are surface-nucleated glass-ceramics. Such bulk parts may include architectural products, such as push plates on doors and other high-touch areas in hospitals, schools, and office buildings. Furthermore, compositions of the ternary of FIG. 1 are black, though some are burnt orange. Black color may be an advantage for applications that require bulk parts. Still further, compositions disclosed herein, such as those of the ternary of FIG. 1 are phosphate glasses, but surprisingly Applicants have discovered the materials can be machined under normal atmospheric conditions (e.g., room temperature, 25\u00b0 C. temperature, within 50\u00b0 C. of 0\u00b0 C., atmospheric pressure, 101,325 pascals pressure, 50% relative humidity, open air). Manufacturing methods include forming the materials at such conditions.",
                        "FIGS. 2 and 3 show microstructure of BHB (see Table 1 below), a glass-ceramic material, and BHE (see Table 1 below), a single-phase glass, respectively. The lack of phase separation in BHE in concert with the full kill result is notable because conventional glass-ceramic materials with antimicrobial properties are typically or exclusively phase-separated and contain Cu1+ as cuprite crystals, and are glass-ceramics, as opposed to amorphous glass and/or single-phase amorphous glass.",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 1-2 and 4 compositions disclosed herein include phosphate glass-ceramics and phase-separated phosphate glasses. Referring specifically to the sample BHB shown in FIG. 2, scanning electron microscopy shows distinct phase separation, with a glassy phase, copper metal, and crystalline phases. X-ray diffraction shows the compositions for the different phases differ from one another. For example, the copper metal of spectrum 28 is far different from the glassy phase of spectrums 29 and 30, as well as the spectrum 31 phase. Notably the glassy phase is a phosphate glass, as disclosed herein, but still includes silica, possibly due to contamination from crucible melting. FIGS. 4-5 are x-ray diffraction measurements from a powdered 1-inch by 1-inch polished coupon of BHB (FIG. 6 left) and BHE (FIG. 6 right), and represent interior of the respective patty. Accordingly, FIG. 4 shows BHB contains copper metal and crystalline copper phosphate phase (potentially with iron), while FIG. 5 shows BHE is amorphous.",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 3 and 5, surprisingly Applicants discovered that subtle differences in constituents of the ternary of FIG. 1 compared to those of BHB led to fully amorphous glass disclosed herein, such as example BHE. FIG. 5 shows BHE to be amorphous. Compare the scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffraction of FIGS. 2 and 4 versus FIGS. 3 and 5. The latter results are indicative of single-phase, fully amorphous glass. Applicants believe fully amorphous glass in this system and/or with the antimicrobial properties shown is particularly unique and surprising because conventional antimicrobial glass-ceramics rely on cuprite crystals to inhibit microbes and a fully amorphous glass, especially of single phase, may not be expected to function to inhibit microbes as disclosed herein. Without being bound to any theory, one possible explanation for antimicrobial efficacy of single-phase, fully amorphous glasses disclosed herein could be formation of a thin surface layer of copper oxide that kills or inhibits microbes. Such a layer may be particularly thin, such as less than 10 \u03bcm in embodiments, and may form by exposure of the glass to open atmosphere or may be facilitated, such as by heating in oxygen.",
                        "The melt and coupon (FIG. 6 left 1-inch by 1-inch square coupon) of sample BHB show phase separation (see FIG. 2). Phases of copper metal, crystalline phases of iron, copper phosphate and glass were observed. The surface of BHB melt has a thin copper oxide layer. The melt and coupon (FIG. 6 right 1-inch by 1-inch square coupon) of sample BHE did not show any phases or apparent phase separation under any of the analysis conditions (polished, fractured or ion milled) (see FIG. 3). The surface of BHE melt has a thin copper oxide layer.",

                        "Utilizing this weathering test information from the Comparative Examples, glass compositions with greater durability were developed. To minimize or prevent the weathering that occurred in the Comparative Examples, the glass composition was changed to a higher durability composition utilizing the iron-containing oxide, such as Fe2O3. Put another way, Applicants found increased durability accomplished by increasing the Fe2O3 content. Adding Fe2O3 increased durability of the glasses such that the surface crystallization and weathering was reduced or prevented.",
                        "However, Applicants discovered that while increase in Fe2O3 increased durability of the glass composition, adding too much Fe2O3 decreased the antimicrobial properties of the glass composition. Applicants believe too much Fe2O3 creates glass that is too durable and does not release enough copper to be effective as an antimicrobial glass. For example, it was found that too much Fe2O3 may result in devitrification upon pouring of mixed molten glass, during manufacturing. For high phosphorus- and copper-oxides batch compositions (e.g., >40 mol % of each), as disclosed above, Applicants discovered a concentration of Fe2O3 greater than 12 mol % began to devitrify and a concentration greater than 15 mol % were mainly crystalline. As further discussed below, processing steps may be used with such glasses to control or limit crystal growth. Accordingly, the Fe2O3 concentration was increased enough to increase durability but maintained less than 15 mol % or less than 12 mol % to prevent the crystallization and/or devitrification for such applications benefitting from amorphous, antimicrobial glass of black color able to withstand use in open atmosphere without excessive weathering.",

The examples listed in Table 5 were tested in 85% RH at 45\u00b0 C. for 144 hours.",

As analyzed, each of the examples includes P2O5, CuO, Fe2O3, and SiO2. The SiO2 may be optionally incorporated, for example, to reduce costs and/or due to contamination during melting in a quartz crucible. Different processing equipment (e.g., platinum-lined) may be used to prevent contamination.",
                        "Each of the examples in Table 5 are phosphate glasses and therefore have a greater amount of P2O5 than SiO2. The glass may include a concentration of P2O5 greater than 15 mol %, greater than 30 mol %, greater than 40 mol %, greater than 45 mol %, or greater than 50 mol % as batched and/or as analyzed; and/or no more than 80 mol %, such as no more than 60 mol %, such as no more than 50 mol %. In certain aspects, the concentration of P2O5 is from 45 mol % to 47 mol %, as batched and/or as analyzed.",
                        "Additionally, the examples of Table 5 include CuO (oxides of copper in amounts with equivalent copper contribution of CuO) to facilitate antimicrobial properties. The copper ions (e.g., Cu+ and/or Cu2+) may be released within the glass to provide the antimicrobial properties listed in Table 5. Applicants believe that the amorphous structure of the glass may be advantageous for allowing release of the copper. As batched and as analyzed, the composition includes a concentration of CuO greater than 15 mol %, greater than 30 mol %, greater than 40 mol %, greater than 45 mol %, or greater than 50 mol %; and/or no more than 80 mol %, such as no more than 60 mol %, such as no more than 50 mol %. In certain aspects, the concentration of CuO is from 42 mol % to 48 mol %.",
                        "In various examples, the glass composition primarily includes monovalent copper (Cu+ or Cu1+). The monovalent copper, compared to bivalent copper (Cu2+), is generally more mobile within the glass article, which allows the copper to move to the surface of the glass article more easily to provide the antimicrobial properties. In comparison, bivalent copper may not be as freely movable within the glass and therefore glass with bivalent copper may exhibit less antimicrobial efficacy. Applicants have found antimicrobial efficacy of Cu ions decreases with efficacy, such that Cu0>Cu1+>Cu2+. Accordingly, when used for applications benefiting from antimicrobial performance, the glass includes a greater amount of monovalent copper than bivalent copper, or more preferably, the glass includes primarily (e.g., >80% of the copper, >90%, >95%) monovalent copper.",
                        "Applicants have discovered that the temperature at which the batch materials or constituents are melted may contribute to the amount of monovalent copper in the glass. For example, Applicants believe a higher temperature, such as melting the batch constituents at 1350\u00b0 C., leads to a more reducing environment, which results in more copper being reduced to the monovalent state. When the glass is melted at lower temperatures, for example at 900\u00b0 C., less copper is reduced to the monovalent state, which can cause the antimicrobial efficacy of the glass to be reduced. However, if a quartz crucible is used for melting the batch materials, higher temperature may result in more SiO2 contamination. Therefore, melting at an intermediate temperature, such as between 1050\u00b0 C. and 1150\u00b0 C. may be advantageous for reducing copper to the monovalent state while having a lesser effect on the quartz crucible, if such a crucible is used. Without using quartz, innovative methods of producing the materials include heating the copper to a temperature of at least 1050\u00b0 C., such as at least 1150\u00b0 C., 1350\u00b0 C. during melting of the constituents.",
                        "Further, glass compositions from Table 5 include \u201cFe2O3\u201d (oxides of iron in amounts with equivalent iron contribution of Fe2O3), which may increase durability of the glass composition, as discussed. Fe2O3 concentration for such aspects is less than 20 mol %, less than 15 mol %, or less than 10 mol %, as batched and/or as analyzed; and/or at least 3 mol %, at least 5 mol %, at least 7 mol %, at least 8 mol %. In certain aspects, the concentration of Fe2O3 is from 7 mol % to 12 mol %, as batched and/or as analyzed. The amount of Fe2O3 facilitates the durability and the antimicrobial properties of the glass composition. For example, samples with concentration greater than 15 mol % led to crystallization, and those with concentration greater than 12 mol % led to devitrification as disclosed above. But when the Fe2O3 concentration is too high, not enough copper is released to be effective as antimicrobial glass.",
                        "Glass structure may influence the chemical durability, and greater chemical durability results in lower antimicrobial efficacy through less release of copper in certain applications. The increase in iron appears to be related (e.g., generally proportional, directly proportional) to resistance to weathering. The iron creates a stronger, more chemically resistant bond. Applicants believe P\u2014Fe\u2014O bonds may be more resistant to weathering than P\u2014O\u2014P bonds alone.
