## EXAMPLES

- introduce ImmunoGlobe: a manually curated intercellular immune interaction network

### Example 1

- motivate ImmunoGlobe: enabling systems immunology with a gold standard intercellular immune interaction network
- describe ImmunoGlobe: a map of the immune intercellular interactome
- summarize construction of ImmunoGlobe: manual curation of immune interactions from Janeway's Immunobiology
- detail node and edge attributes: directional interactions between immune system components
- visualize ImmunoGlobe: a graphical immune interaction network model
- analyze ImmunoGlobe: recapitulates known features of the human immune system
- examine degree distributions of nodes: reflects known aspects of immune function
- demonstrate ImmunoGlobe's ability to represent multi-step immunologic mechanisms
- use ImmunoGlobe to examine the network effects of immune stimuli: mass cytometry experiment
- investigate differences between mouse and human immune systems: annotated with nodes and immune processes affected
- compare ImmunoGlobe to immuneXpresso: a database of directional interactions between immune cells and cytokines
- visualize differences between ImmunoGlobe and immuneXpresso networks: adjacency matrix
- discuss applications of ImmunoGlobe: enabling the development of immune network analysis tools

### Example 2

- gather immunoprofiling data
- describe immune profiles varying widely across COVID patients
- associate COVID with changes in immune cell frequencies
- upregulate inflammatory cytokines in COVID infections
- activate broad range of immune modules in COVID
- report correlations among immune components in COVID
- examine differences in immune activity in COVID
- identify immune response differences in moderate vs severe COVID-19 and by gender

### Example 3

- apply systems immunology to cancer
- drive tumor regression in response to radiation therapy
- reflect antitumor immune response mechanisms in antibody isotypes
- identify potential targets for immune modulation of Type 1 immune responses

## Methods
