A polynucleotide may include nucleotide sequences having different functions, including for instance coding sequences, and non-coding sequences such as regulatory sequences. Coding sequence, non-coding sequence, and regulatory sequence are defined below. A polynucleotide can be obtained directly from a natural source, or can be prepared with the aid of recombinant, enzymatic, or chemical techniques. A polynucleotide can be linear or circular in topology. A polynucleotide can be, for example, a portion of a vector, such as an expression or cloning vector, or a fragment.",

For example, a genetically modified Pichinde virus is one into which has been introduced an exogenous polynucleotide, such as a coding region not typically present in a Pichinde virus. Another example of a genetically modified Pichinde virus is one, which has been modified to include three genomic segments.",
                        "A \u201ccoding region\u201d is a nucleotide sequence that encodes an RNA molecule. The boundaries of a coding region are generally determined by a transcription initiation site at its 5\u2032 end and a transcription terminator at its 3\u2032 end. A coding region typically includes at least one nucleotide sequence that encodes a protein. A nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, also referred to as an open reading frame (ORF), has boundaries that are generally determined by a translation start codon at its 5\u2032 end and a translation stop codon at its 3\u2032 end. A coding region can encode an RNA molecule that includes two or more open reading frames. An RNA molecule that includes two or more open reading frames is referred to as a \u201cpolycistronic message.\u201d",

Thus, the terms peptide, oligopeptide, and polypeptide are all included within the definition of protein and these terms are used interchangeably. It should be understood that these terms do not connote a specific length of a polymer of amino acids, nor are they intended to imply or distinguish whether the protein is produced using recombinant techniques, chemical or enzymatic synthesis, or is naturally occurring.",

                        "Provided herein is a reverse genetics system for producing genetically modified Pichinde virus that expresses one or more proteins of avian reovirus. The genetically modified Pichinde virus-based reverse genetics system described herein has multiple advantages over other arenavirus systems for expression of avian reovirus proteins and use in immunizing subjects. Pichinde virus is not known to cause disease in humans, and there is evidence that Pichinde virus can cause asymptomatic human infections in a laboratory setting. For instance, 46% of laboratory personnel working with the virus are serum positive but do not show a distinct illness (Buchmeier et al., 2007, Arenaviridae: the viruses and their replication. In: Knipe and Howley (eds), Fields Virology. 5th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. pp. 1791-1827). The modified Pichinde virus described herein is further attenuated in comparison to the parental virus used in the human-infection study reported by Buchmeier et al. The modified Pichinde virus is genetically stable through serial passages in cell cultures. General human populations and animals (except for rice rats in Colombia, South America, where the virus was originally discovered) are not known to have prior exposure to Pichinde virus, which makes it an ideal vector for vaccine development due to the lack of pre-existing immunity against this Pichinde virus vector.",
                        "The reverse genetics system for this modified Pichinde virus includes three genomic segments. The first genomic segment includes two coding regions, one that encodes a Z protein and a second that encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L RdRp). The second genomic segment includes a coding region that encodes a nucleoprotein (NP), and one or more additional coding regions that encode one or more avian reovirus proteins. The third genomic segment includes a coding region that encodes a glycoprotein, and one or more additional coding regions that encode one or more avian reovirus proteins. The second and third genomic segments can encode the same or different avian reovirus proteins.",
                        "The Z protein, L RdRp, NP protein, and glycoprotein are those encoded by a Pichinde virus. The Z protein is a small RING-domain containing matrix protein that mediates virus budding and regulates viral RNA synthesis. One example of a Z protein from a Pichinde virus is the sequence available at GenBank accession number ABU39910.1 (SEQ ID NO:1). The L RdRp protein is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is required for viral DNA synthesis. One example of a L RdRp protein from a Pichinde virus is the sequence available at GenBank accession number ABU39911.1 (SEQ ID NO:2). The NP protein encapsidates viral genomic RNAs, is required for viral RNA synthesis, and suppresses host innate immune responses. One example of an NP protein from a Pichinde virus is the sequence available at GenBank accession number ABU39909.1 (SEQ ID NO:3). The glycoprotein is post-translationally processed into a stable signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding G1 protein, and the transmembrane G2 protein. One example of a glycoprotein from a Pichinde virus is the sequence available at GenBank accession number ABU39908.1 (SEQ ID NO:4).",
                        "Other examples of Z proteins, L RdRp proteins, NP proteins, and glycoprotein include proteins having structural similarity with a protein that is encoded by a Pichinde virus, for instance, SEQ ID NO:1, 2, 3, and/or 4. Structural similarity of two proteins can be determined by aligning the residues of the two proteins (for example, a candidate protein and a reference protein described herein) to optimize the number of identical amino acids along the lengths of their sequences; gaps in either or both sequences are permitted in making the alignment in order to optimize the number of identical amino acids, although the amino acids in each sequence must nonetheless remain in their proper order. A reference protein may be a protein described herein, such as SEQ ID NO:1, 2, 3, or 4. A candidate protein is the protein being compared to the reference protein. A candidate protein may be isolated, for example, from a cell of an animal, such as a mouse, or can be produced using recombinant techniques, or chemically or enzymatically synthesized. A candidate protein may be inferred from a nucleotide sequence present in the genome of a Pichinde virus.",
                        "Unless modified as otherwise described herein, a pair-wise comparison analysis of amino acid sequences can be carried out using the Blastp program of the blastp suite-2sequences search algorithm, as described by Tatiana et al., (FEMS Microbiol Lett, 174, 247-250 (1999)), and available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. The default values for all blastp suite-2sequences search parameters may be used, including general parameters: expect threshold=10, word size=3, short queries=on; scoring parameters: matrix=BLOSUM62, gap costs=existence:11 extension:1, compositional adjustments=conditional compositional score matrix adjustment. Alternatively, proteins may be compared using the BESTFIT algorithm in the GCG package (version 10.2, Madison WI).",
                        "In the comparison of two amino acid sequences, structural similarity may be referred to by percent \u201cidentity\u201d or may be referred to by percent \u201csimilarity.\u201d \u201cIdentity\u201d refers to the presence of identical amino acids. \u201cSimilarity\u201d refers to the presence of not only identical amino acids but also the presence of conservative substitutions. A conservative substitution for an amino acid in a protein described herein may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, it is known in the art of protein biochemistry that an amino acid belonging to a grouping of amino acids having a particular size or characteristic (such as charge, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) can be substituted for another amino acid without altering the activity of a protein, particularly in regions of the protein that are not directly associated with biological activity. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Conservative substitutions include, for example, Lys for Arg and vice versa to maintain a positive charge; Glu for Asp and vice versa to maintain a negative charge; Ser for Thr so that a free \u2014OH is maintained; and Gln for Asn to maintain a free \u2014NH2.",

                                "Abstract",
                                "Vaccination may be an effective way to reduce turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV) infection in turkey flocks; however, there are currently no commercial vaccines available against TARV infection. Here, we describe the use of reverse genetics technology to generate a recombinant Pichinde virus (PICV) that expresses the 51 (sigma C) and/or S3 (sigma B) proteins of TARV as antigens. Nine recombinant PICVs were developed carrying the wild type 51 and/or S3 genes from three different TARV strains. In addition, three recombinant PICVs were produced carrying codon optimized 51 and/or S3 genes of a single TARV strain. The 51 and S3 antigens were found to be expressed in virus-infected cells via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct fluorescent antibody (FA) technique using FITC-conjugated anti-avian reovirus antibodies. Turkey poults inoculated with the recombinant PICV vaccine expressing the bivalent TARV 51 and S3 antigens developed high anti-TARV antibody titers indicating the immunogenicity (and safety) of this vaccine. Future in vivo challenge studies using a turkey reovirus infection model will determine the optimum dose and protective efficacy of this recombinant virus-vectored vaccine. This Example is also available as Kumar et al. Pathogens. 2021, 10(2):197, doi: 10.3390/pathogens10020197. PMID: 33668435.",
                                "1. Introduction",
                                "Turkey arthritis reoviruses (TARVs) re-emerged in 2011 in Minnesota and other states in the US [1-3]. The viral genome consists of 10 segments of dsRNA grouped into large (L1, L2, L3), medium (M1, M2, M3), and small (S1, S2, S3, S4) based on migration pattern on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [4,5]. The genome has 12 open reading frames (ORFs), which encode for eight structural and four non-structural proteins. The proteins encoded by L, M and S genes are lambda (\u03bb), mu (m) and sigma (\u03c3), respectively [5]. The S1 and S3 segments translate into \u03c3C (cell attachment) and \u03c3B (outer capsid) proteins, respectively. The \u03c3C protein possesses both type and broad-specific epitopes, while \u03c3B protein contains group-specific neutralizing epitope [6]. TARV-infected turkeys display clinical disease in the form of lameness, tenosynovitis, and arthritis resulting in huge economic losses mainly due to culling. No commercial vaccine is available to protect turkey flocks from the emerging TARV strains. Some turkey producers rely on the use of autogenous vaccines. However, the evolving nature of the virus to create new mutant strains poses a challenge to regularly update the vaccines. Additionally, there is no live vaccine available that can be used for priming before boosting breeder turkeys with injectable killed vaccines.",
                                "Using a live and safe vectored vaccine to deliver TARV antigens is a reasonable alternative to live reovirus vaccines. Recently, a Pichinde virus (PICV) vector was developed that safely and effectively delivered the model antigens, the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) [7]. This arenavirus was first isolated from its natural host Oryzomys albigularis (rice rats) in the Pichinde valley of Colombia, South America [8]. Arenaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with a bisegmented genome and are known to target dendritic cells and macrophages at early stages of infection, making it a potentially powerful vaccine vector [9,10,11,12].",
                                "Using reverse genetics technique, a live recombinant PICV (strain 18) with a tri-segmented RNA genome (rP18tri) has been developed to carry and express up to two foreign genes. One of the foreign genes could be the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can be used to mark virus-infected cells in cell culture. The rP18tri has been shown to be attenuated both in vitro and in vivo and has the ability to induce cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [7]. For example, mice immunized with recombinant PICV-hemagglutinin (PICV-HA), expressing the modeled influenza hemagglutinin protein, developed a strong humoral response against HA that afforded complete protection against a lethal avian influenza virus infection. Additionally, the immune responses, both humoral immune response against the modeled influenza HA and cell-mediated immune response against the modeled influenza NP, increased significantly after a booster dose of the same vaccine [7].",
                                "The present study was undertaken to develop recombinant PICV vaccines expressing one or both TARV antigenic S1 and S3 proteins. In addition, the vaccines were administered to turkey poults to determine vaccine safety and efficacy. This is a \u2018proof of concept\u2019 study for the development and recovery of recombinant PICV-TARV viruses and testing the safety and immunogenic properties of the turkey reovirus S1 and S3 protein(s) in vivo.",
                                "2. Materials and Methods",
                                "2.1 Cells and Viruses: QT-35 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 ug/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, BSRT7-5 cells (BHK-21 cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase), Vero cells, and LMH cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) that contained 10% FBS, 1 ug/ml Gentamicin, and 50 ug/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Media for BSRT7-5 cells was also supplemented with 1 \u03bcg/ml Gentamicin (Invitrogen-Life Technologies). Three strains of turkey arthritis reovirus (SKM73, SKM95 and SKM121) isolated in QT-35 cells from tendons of lame turkeys were used. These viruses were selected based on their pathogenicity and genomic characterization.",
                                "2.2 Pichinde virus plasmids: Three plasmids were used: (i) pP18S1-GPC/MCS encodes the glycoprotein GPC and a multiple-cloning-site (MCS) to clone the gene of interest; (ii) pP18S2-MCS/NP encodes the nucleoprotein NP and a MCS; (iii) and pP18L plasmid (the L plasmid) expresses the full-length antigenomic strand of the rP18L segment under the control of T7 promoter and does not contain any specific site to clone foreign genes [7]. These three plasmids were obtained from Dr. Ly's laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA.",
                                "2.3 Preparation of vectors and gene inserts: Genomic RNA was isolated from three TARV isolates (SKM73, SKM95, and SKM121). Full-length open reading frame (ORF) of S1 and S3 genomic segments of these viruses were amplified. Additionally, the S1 and S3 ORF sequences of SKM121 were codon-optimized and commercially custom synthesized in a pUC vector. The cDNA was synthesized using random primers and SuperScript\u2122 IV First-Strand Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog #18091200, Waltham, MA, USA) and was PCR amplified using specific cloning primers (Table 1) and Phusion\u00ae High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (NEB Catalog #M0531S, Ipswich, MA, USA). The NheI and Kozak sequences were added in the forward primer so that these features are included in the amplified product. Similarly, XhoI and sequence tags (FLAG tag in S1 and HA tag in S3 gene) were added in the reverse primer. The reaction conditions were: 98\u00b0 C. for 30 sec (initial denaturation); 5 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0 C. for 10 sec, annealing at 66\u00b0 C. for 30 sec and extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min; 30 cycles of denaturation 98\u00b0 C. for 10 sec, annealing at 72\u00b0 C. for 30 sec and extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min; final extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 7 min and 4\u00b0 C. hold. The PCR amplified products (S1 and S3 genes of all three isolates) and the plasmids of the PICV (pP18S1-GPC/MCS and pP18S2-MCS/NP) were restriction digested (NheI and XhoI, NEB) and gel purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Catalog #28704, Germantown, MD, USA). The codon-optimized versions of ORF were extracted from the pUC vector by restriction double digestion.",
                                "2.4 Cloning and Transfection: The S1 and S3 gene inserts were ligated in MCS region of plasmids pP18S2-MCS/NP and pP18S1-GPC/MCS, respectively, using 5 U/\u03bcL of T4 DNA ligase (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog #EL0011). The ligation reaction mix was used to transform competent bacterial cells (DH5a) followed by selection using ampicillin antibiotic. All plasmids (plasmid pP18L, pP18S1-GPC/GFP, pP18S2-GFP/NP, and recombinant plasmids pP18S1-GPC/S3 and pP18S2-S1/NP) were isolated by plasmid midi prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant plasmids were PCR-confirmed for reovirus genes and sequence-confirmed for correct orientation and reading frame. The recombinant plasmids were used to transfect BSRT7-5 cells in various combinations (Table 2) using Lipofectamine\u2122 3000 transfection reagent (ThermoFisher, Catalog #L3000008) following manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications. Briefly, BSRT7-5 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 80% confluency. Four hours before transfection, the cells were washed, and fresh antibiotic-free media was added. For transfection, 8 \u03bcl of P3000 reagent, 2 \u03bcg of L-plasmid and 1 \u03bcg each of S1 and S2 plasmids were diluted in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. In another tube, 10 \u03bcl of lipofectamine was diluted in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM. Both mixtures were combined followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min to prepare DNA-Lipid complexes. The cells were transfected with the resultant mixture, and MEM was changed after 4 h to remove the toxic lipofectamine. After 48, 72 and 96 h post transfection, cell supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Different monovalent and bivalent vector viruses were generated as detailed in Table 2. The resultant viral recovery was confirmed by observing green fluorescence of GFP in inoculated cell culture. The rescued virus was then grown in BHK-21 cells and the GFP green fluorescence was observed. The presence of reovirus genes was confirmed by gene-specific PCR.",
                                "2.5 Detection of reovirus antigenic proteins: The expression of GC and GB proteins by recombinant tri-segmented PICV vaccine viruses in BHK-21 cells was verified by direct fluorescence antibody (FA) assay. The BHK-21 cells were inoculated with the recombinant PICVs and at 96 h post infection (hpi), the cells were harvested, plated on 12-chamber slides and dried for 2 hours. Cells were then fixed in acetone for 2 hours followed by the addition of polyclonal FITC-conjugated anti-avian reovirus antibodies (National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA, USA, Reagent #680-ADV). After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in a CO2 incubator for 2 hours, counter staining was done using 0.1% Evan Blue biological stain (EBBS). The slides were then mounted and examined under a fluorescent microscope to observe FITC green fluorescence, which was indicative of avian reovirus protein expression by the vectored viruses.",
                                "2.6 Vaccination experiment: In a pilot experiment, four groups of turkey poults (5 birds/group) were inoculated with 0.2 mL of the following recombinant PICVs containing codon optimized gene segments of TARV-SKM121 (monovalent PICV-S1, monovalent PICV-S3, bivalent PICV-S1/S3, and PICV-control without any TARV segment insertion) via oral route at 1 week of age. Birds in all groups were revaccinated with at 3 weeks of age via intranasal (I/N) route. Blood samples were collected at 3 and 5 weeks of age. At the end of the experiment, all birds were euthanized, and necropsy was done to detect the development of any gross lesions.",
                                "2.7 Serum neutralization assay: Sera were separated from the collected blood samples and subjected to serum neutralization assay against TARV-SKM121. Significant variations (P<0.05) in serum neutralization titers among different groups were tested by using non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney U test.",
                                "3. Results",
                                "3.1 Cloning of reovirus genes into PICV plasmids: The RT-PCR amplification of 51 and S3 ORF yielded the expected product sizes of 1031 bp and 1157 bp, respectively (FIG. 3A). These products were gel purified and cloned into pP18S2-MCS/NP and pP18S1-GPC/MCS, respectively. Restriction enzyme double digestion confirmed the presence of reovirus genes in recombinant PICV plasmids (FIG. 3B). Sanger sequencing confirmed the absence of mutation in cloned viral gene as well as their correct reading frame and correct orientation in the vector backbones (data not shown).",
                                "3.2 Plasmid transfection and virus rescue: Viable recombinant PICVs were rescued successfully following transfection of BSRT7-5 cells with the three plasmids in various combinations as shown in Table 2. The GFP expression was observed 48-72 h post transfection in cells transfected with at least one GFP-containing plasmid (FIG. 4A) (all monovalent vaccines in Table 2). The GFP-expressing foci increased in size over the time course of transfection. The supernatants were collected from transfected BSR7-5 cells and were used to infect BHK21 cells. Strong GFP expression was detected in infected BHK21 cells at 24-48 hpi using fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 4B) indicating the rescue of viable viruses. At every rescue attempt, we obtained infectious viruses at 48-72 h post transfection. The recombinant viruses showed minor GFP fluorescence in QT-35 and LMH cells at 96 hours after inoculation. As expected, the bivalent viruses having two TARV genes on both plasmids did not produce any green fluorescence.",
                                "3.3 Recombinant PICVs expressing reovirus antigens: Strong GFP expression by infected BHK21 cells indicated successful rescue of recombinant viruses. The supernatant from infected BHK21 cells (passage P1, P2 and up to P3) was used to detect reovirus genes by RT-PCR. The results confirmed the presence of both viral genes in bivalent vaccine viruses and either 51 or S3 gene in the monovalent vaccine viruses. To verify the expression of reovirus antigenic proteins (GC and GB) by the recombinant PICVs, we infected BHK21 cells with transfection supernatant and then at 48 hpi conducted a direct fluorescence assay (DFA) using polyclonal FITC-conjugated anti-avian reovirus antibodies. The PICVs grown on BHK-21 showed varying degrees of fluorescence (FIG. 5). The monovalent and bivalent PICVs that contained either 51 or S3 or both, showed fluorescence in BHK-21 cells. Although we did not quantify the amount of fluorescence, PICVs containing SKM121 gene segments showed a remarkably higher degree of fluorescence, particularly the bivalent PICV that contained codon optimized S1 and S3 segments (FIG. 6). Minimal fluorescence was observed in negative controls (cells that contained recovered PICV vector without any TARV segment).",
                                "3.5 Vaccination/Necropsy: Birds inoculated with the vaccines neither displayed any clinical disease or illness during the study nor showed any gross lesions at necropsy.",
                                "3.6 Serum Neutralization Assay: At 3 weeks of age, 3 of 4 sera from birds inoculated with monovalent PICV-S3 vaccine and 4 of 5 sera from birds inoculated with bivalent PICV-S1/S3 vaccine showed serum neutralizing (SN) antibody titers of 64, which were significantly higher (p<0.05) than the other two groups (FIG. 6). At 5 weeks of age, only one of three birds inoculated with monovalent PICV-S1, monovalent PICV-S3 and PICV-control had an SN antibody titer of 64 while all five sera from birds inoculated with the bivalent vaccine had high SN antibody titers ranging from 64 to 256, which were significantly higher (p<0.05) than the other three groups (FIG. 6). Individual bird's data show that there was a remarkable increase in the SN antibody titers of birds inoculated with the bivalent PICV-S1/S3 vaccine at 5 weeks of age while other groups did not show any remarkable increase in titers (FIG. 6).",
                                "4. Discussion",
                                "Using PICV as a vector to express TARV antigenic proteins appears an attractive alternative to the use of live attenuated vaccines that may result in the emergence of mutant strains. Recombinant PICV expressing the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of influenza initiated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and provided full protection against lethal influenza in mice [7] and was shown to be safe and effective in chickens. The purpose of this study was to develop recombinant PICV-TARV vaccines that can carry S1 and/or S3 genes of turkey arthritis reoviruses. We successfully recovered PICV after insertion of TARV genomic segments in the PICV plasmids, detected the inserted genes and confirmed the expression of recombinant antigenic proteins.",
                                "A total of 12 different recombinant PICVs were developed. We used the wild type genes from three different TARV isolates in addition to codon-optimized genes from one TARV isolate in an effort to find an optimum TARV candidate to be used in developing a vaccine. The recovered PICV recombinants grew well in BHK-21 cells but showed minimal growth on QT-35 and LMH cells as determined by the expression of green fluorescence protein in recombinant PICV that contained one each of TARV gene and GFP gene. No GFP gene was inserted in the double recombinant PICV (containing both S1 and S3 genes of TARV) and hence they could not be subjected to the green fluorescence test. We assume that these viruses grew the same way as the monovalent viruses because their plasmids and transfection were done under the same conditions. The detection of the inserted genes and protein expression was helpful in determining successful recovery and growth of bivalent PICV. The use of RT-PCR to detect the inserted TARV genome in recovered viruses helped in determining the success of recovering recombinant PICV that contained either S1 or S3, or both.",
                                "To confirm the expression of reoviral antigenic proteins by the recombinant PICVs, we used the direct fluorescent antibody technique (FA) using FITC-conjugated anti-avian reovirus antibodies. The FA procedure included dehydration and long fixation with acetone. These two steps helped eliminate GFP fluorescence and increased permeabilization of the cell membrane. The permeabilization of the cell membrane enabled the entrance of the FITC-conjugated antibody to the intracellular recombinant viral proteins. Although we did not have a quantitative method to measure the amount of the expressed protein, we could subjectively observe that the fluorescence produced by viruses recombined with SKM121 genes was more than that produced by SKM73 and SKM95. The bivalent PICV that contained codon optimized S1 and S3 of SKM121 showed the best fluorescence indicating the growth of these viruses, which did not have any GFP fluorescence after transfection.",
                                "Since codon-optimized PICV-based TARV SKM121 vaccines showed the best expression of TARV S1 and/or S3 proteins, we used these vaccines for a pilot in vivo experiment. PICV without an insertion of TARV gene was used as a control. The in vivo experiment was to determine the safety and humoral response generated by the recombinant vaccines in turkey poults. Turkey poults were vaccinated with the same dose of vaccine (0.3 mL, 3\u00d7105 PFU/mL) via oral and intranasal route using a prime-boost strategy. Poults were primed at 1 week of age because birds are susceptible to avian reovirus infection in the early days of their life [13,14]; hence, vaccination strategies are designed to provide passive immunity from maternal antibodies by vaccinating breeders or by actively immunizing young bids with a live vaccine [15]. Priming at 1 week of age was also considered to avoid vaccination shock and poor intestinal immunity in day old birds [15]. Booster dose was given intranasally at 3 weeks of age, targeting the coarse spray administration with the same vaccine as previously described [16]. The booster vaccination was done after 2 weeks of priming because the recombinant PICV-based vaccine needs 2-3 weeks to provoke the best immune responses. Immunogenicity of the codon-optimized bivalent PICV-based TARV SKM121 vaccine was demonstrated by the production of high SN antibody titers. In future in vivo experiments, we plan to further characterize the effect of the dose of the recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines on antibody titer and response to reovirus challenge in turkeys, as well as to study the efficacy of protection of the PICV-based TARV vaccines against heterologous and homologous challenge viruses. In conclusion, the bivalent PICVs carrying codon-optimized genes of the SKM121 turkey reoviral isolate showed the best results in vitro and in vivo. We plan to use PICV carrying the codon-optimized genes of SKM121 for future in vivo studies in turkeys to study the efficacy of protection of the PICV-TARV recombinant vaccines against heterologous and homologous challenge viruses.",

                                "Experimental plan: Day-old turkey poults (n=80) were procured from a non-vaccinated and reovirus-free flock. Ten poults were euthanized on the day of arrival to collect serum samples for anti-TARV antibody testing, which were found to be negative. Meconium, intestine and tendon samples were tested by real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) to ensure that these turkey poults were also negative for reovirus. The remaining 70 poults were randomly divided into five groups (see Table 3 below). These groups were (1) negative control (NC), (2) vaccine control (VC), (3) vaccinated and challenged with TARV SKM121 (V-SKM), (4) sentinels placed in contact with vaccinated birds and then challenged with TARV SKM121 (Sen-SKM), (5), non-vaccinated birds challenged with TARV SKM121 (SKM) as positive controls to ensure that the challenge virus was infectious. The five groups of birds were housed in separate air-filtered isolators. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.",
                                "Poults were vaccinated orally with a primary dose of rPICV-TARV vaccine (0.2 ml, 3\u00d7107 PFU/ml) at 2 days of age (day of age). In Sen-SKM group, 12 birds were wing banded and added as sentinels after 2 days of primary vaccination (4 day of age). Poults in groups 2, 3, and 4 were boosted intranasally (except the sentinels and NC) with 0.2 ml (3\u00d7107 PFU/ml) of the vaccine at 9 days of age. On day 14, blood samples were collected from the non-vaccinated, vaccinated, and sentinel birds (groups 1, 3, and 4) for serology. At 15 days of age, birds in groups 3, 4, and 5 were challenged orally with 0.2 ml (3.2\u00d7107 TCID50/ml) of TARV SKM121 while groups 1 and 2 (NC and VC) were sham inoculated with 0.2 ml of cell culture media (MEM). The birds were examined daily for any overt clinical signs or mortality. No mortality or lameness was observed in any of the birds. All birds were euthanized at the age of 35 days and their body weights were recorded. We chose to euthanize the birds at 35 days of age because our previous research to establish a TARV challenge model has indicated that poults orally challenged at one week of age with a virulent strain of TARV did not show histological evidence of tenosynovitis until after 28-35 days of age. At necropsy, gross lesions were noted followed by collection of ileocecum and hock joint with gastrocnemius and digital flexor tendons for real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and histopathology.",
                                "Summary of Results:",
                                "Poults directly vaccinated with rPICV-TARV and the sentinel poults (in contact with vaccinated poults) produced serum neutralizing antibodies against TARV (FIG. 7). The sentinel poults developed neutralizing antibodies at the same level as the vaccinated poults (antibody titers 1:64 to 1:256) indicating that the vaccine can be transmitted to non-vaccinated pen mates (sentinels) followed by the development of a humoral immune response. This is an unexpected but positive outcome, because it suggests that the rPICV-TARV vaccine can be used to mediate population (or herd) immunity in turkey flocks.",
                                "The vaccinated and control poults showed similar body weights, indicating the good safety profile of this type of a vaccine in turkey as no adverse symptoms or negative effects on feed efficiency of the vaccinated poults were observed. In contrast, the mean body weights of poults challenged with the virulent reovirus alone were significantly lower than that of the vaccinated poults (V-SKM) at 35 day of age, indicating the expected virulent nature of the challenge virus used in the study (FIG. 8).",
                                "At 35 days of age, the vaccinated poults had significantly lower reoviral replication (TARV-SKM) in the intestine compared to that in non-vaccinated/challenged poults, indicating that the rPICV-TARV vaccine could suppress replication of an infectious reovirus challenge in the intestine of these animals (FIG. 9A). However, at 35 days of age, there were no significant differences in TARV-SKM replication in the gastrocnemius tendons of rPICV-TARV-vaccinated poults, sentinel poults and nonvaccinated/challenged poults (FIG. 9B). This observation is unexpected and suggests an area for further investigations.",
                                "At 35 days of age, the vaccinated/challenged poults had numerically greater mean tendon inflammation than vaccinated and sentinel poults; however, this difference was statistically significant only in the sentinel poults (FIG. 10). Again, this observation is unexpected and suggests another potential area for further investigations.",
                                "Conclusions and Discussion",
                                "The study produced some expected and unexpected findings. First, the rPICV-TARV vaccine can produce serum neutralizing antibodies against TARV after dual dosing of turkey poults. Additionally, the vaccinated poults can transmit the virus laterally to sentinels, resulting in a similar production of serum neutralizing antibodies against TARV and suggesting a potential advantage and utility of this formulation of the vaccine to produce population (or herd) immunity. Vaccinated/challenged poults had no mortality and similar body weights to negative control poults, indicating the rPICV-TARV vaccine was safe. Vaccinated poults likely maintain their body weights because reoviral replication in the intestine is reduced post challenge compared to that in non-vaccinated poults. At the current dose and vaccination timing, the rPICV-TARV vaccine does not appear to effectively reduce TARV replication in the gastrocnemius tendon when compared to the vaccinated poults. Alternatively, there might be a potential tissue-specificity phenomenon of reovirus replication and vaccine efficacy for future investigations. Future work should focus on adjustment of the vaccine regimen for rPICV-TARV to provide a broad level of protection and to examine the potential of reovirus replication and vaccine efficacy in a certain and specific tissue of the vaccinated animals. Future work should also focus on altering the age of inoculation, the vaccine dose, increasing the time period between the prime and boost in order to enhance humoral immune development and maintenance in the vaccinated animals, and increasing the numbers of poults used in each experimental group. The period between prime and booster vaccination in our study was only 7 days; however, our recent studies have indicated that the rPICV-TARV vaccine should be given at least three weeks prior to virus challenge in order to allow the vaccinated animals to form memory B cells for a heightened level of immune reaction to the antigens and antibody production. The age at prime-boost (02 and 09 day of age) and age at virus challenge (15 day of age) adopted in this study were based on previous research conducted on reovirus infection in chickens with a particular attention to the age of chicken susceptibility to reovirus infection. However, our recent study (Example 1 and Kumar et al., 2021 Pathogens. 10(2):197. doi: 10.3390/pathogens10020197. PMID: 33668435) recommended a gap of 2-3 weeks between the prime and booster dose in turkeys.
