    "abstract": "Vaccination may be an effective way to reduce turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV)-induced lameness in turkey flocks. However, there are currently no commercial vaccines available against TARV infection. Here, we describe the use of reverse genetics technology to generate a recombinant Pichinde virus (PICV) that expresses the Sigma C and/or Sigma B proteins of TARV as antigens. Nine recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines were developed carrying the wild-type S1 (Sigma C) and/or S3 (Sigma B) genes from three different TARV strains. In addition, three recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines were produced carrying codon-optimized S1 and/or S3 genes of a TARV strain. The S1 and S3 genes and antigens were found to be expressed in virus-infected cells via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) technique, respectively. Turkey poults inoculated with the recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccine expressing the bivalent TARV S1 and S3 antigens developed high anti-TARV antibody titers, indicating the immunogenicity (and safety) of this vaccine. Future in vivo challenge studies using a turkey reovirus infection model will determine the optimum dose and protective efficacy of this recombinant virus-vectored candidate vaccine.",

                "Turkey arthritis reoviruses (TARVs) re-emerged in 2011 in Minnesota and other states in the United States (US) [1,2,3]. The viral genome consists of 10 segments of dsRNA grouped into large (L1, L2, L3), medium (M1, M2, M3), and small (S1, S2, S3, S4) segments according to their migration pattern on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [4,5]. The genome has 12 open reading frames (ORFs), which encode for eight structural and four nonstructural proteins. The proteins encoded by L, M, and S genes are lambda (\u03bb), mu (m), and sigma (\u03c3), respectively [5]. The S1 and S3 segments translate into \u03c3C (cell attachment) and \u03c3B (outer capsid) proteins, respectively. The \u03c3C protein is a minor outer capsid protein of 326 amino acids, which has been identified as cell attachment protein responsible for virus entry into the host cell [6]. The \u03c3C protein mediates virus entry into the host cell via the Caveolin-1-mediated and dynamin-2-dependent endocytic pathway [7]. The \u03c3C protein is also known to induce apoptosis [8]. The C-terminal fragment of \u03c3C (residues 151\u2013326) contains the receptor-binding globular domain [9]. The \u03c3C protein is the main immunogenic surface protein that possesses both type- and broad-specific epitopes, and it can elicit reovirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in the infected host [10]. The \u03c3B protein of 367 amino acids is a major component of the viral outer capsid that contains a group-specific neutralizing epitope [11]. Subunit vaccines for chicken arthritis reovirus (CARV) are available that contain either a partial fragment of \u03c3C protein [12] or a full-length \u03c3C protein alone [13] or in combination with \u03c3B protein [14]. The recombinant \u03c3C protein as a subunit vaccine has been used against duck reovirus [15]. Hence, \u03c3C and \u03c3B proteins have been commonly used in the development of subunit vaccines against avian reovirus infection in different avian species. Since TARVs are similar to CARVs in terms of their genomic structure, segment sizes, and open reading frames, the \u03c3C and \u03c3B of TARV should be considered in the development of mono- or multivalent virus vectored vaccines against TARV.",
                "TARV-infected turkeys display clinical lameness due to tenosynovitis and arthritis, resulting in huge economic losses mainly due to culling. No commercial vaccine is available to protect turkey flocks from the emerging TARV strains. Some turkey producers rely on the use of autogenous vaccines. However, the evolving nature of the virus creating new divergent strains poses a challenge for regular update of the vaccines. Additionally, there is no live vaccine available that can be used for priming before boosting breeder turkeys with injectable killed vaccines.",
                "Using a live and safe vectored vaccine to deliver TARV antigens is a reasonable alternative to live reovirus vaccines. Recently, a Pichinde virus (PICV) vector was developed that safely and effectively delivered the model antigens, the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA), and nucleoprotein (NP) [16]. This arenavirus was first isolated from its natural host Oryzomys albigularis (rice rats) in the Pichinde valley of Colombia, South America [17]. Arenaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with a bisegmented genome and are known to target dendritic cells and macrophages at the early stages of infection, making them a potentially powerful vaccine vector [18,19,20,21].",
                "Using the reverse genetics technique, a live recombinant PICV (strain 18) with a trisegmented RNA genome (rP18tri) was developed to carry and express up to two foreign genes. One of the foreign genes could be the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can be used to mark virus-infected cells in cell culture. rP18tri has been shown to be attenuated both in vitro and in vivo and has the ability to induce cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. For example, mice immunized with recombinant PICV\u2013hemagglutinin (PICV\u2013HA), expressing the modeled influenza hemagglutinin protein, developed a strong humoral response against HA that afforded complete protection against a lethal avian influenza virus infection [16].",
                "The present study was undertaken to develop recombinant PICV vaccines expressing TARV antigenic Sigma C (\u03c3C) and/or Sigma B (\u03c3B) proteins. In addition, the vaccines were administered to turkey poults to determine their safety and efficacy. This is a \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d study for the development and recovery of recombinant PICV\u2013TARV viruses, as well as for testing the safety and immunogenic properties of the turkey reovirus \u03c3C and \u03c3B protein(s) in vivo."

Additionally, the S1 and S3 ORF sequences of SKM121 were codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells, commercially custom-synthesized, and cloned into a pUC vector (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). The primary sequences of these genes are provided in Supplementary Materials (Figure S1). The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using random primers and SuperScript\u2122 IV First-Strand Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog#18091200, Waltham, MA, USA) and was PCR-amplified using specific cloning primers (Table 1) and Phusion\u00ae High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (NEB Catalog#M0531S, Ipswich, MA, USA). The NheI and Kozak sequences were added in the forward primer so that these features were included in the amplified product. Similarly, XhoI and sequence tags (FLAG tag in S1 and HA tag in S3 gene) were added to the reverse primer. The reaction conditions were as follows: 98 \u00b0C for 30 s (initial denaturation); five cycles of denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 66 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min and held at 4 \u00b0C.

The ligation reaction mix was used to transform competent bacterial cells (DH5\u03b1) followed by selection using ampicillin antibiotic. All plasmids (plasmid pP18L, pP18S1-GPC/GFP, pP18S2-GFP/NP, and recombinant plasmids pP18S1-GPC/S3 and pP18S2-S1/NP) were isolated using the plasmid midi prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant plasmids were PCR-confirmed for reovirus genes and sequence-confirmed for correct orientation and reading frame. The recombinant plasmids were used to transfect BSRT7-5 cells in various combinations (Table 2) using Lipofectamine\u2122 3000 transfection reagent (ThermoFisher, Catalog#L3000008) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction with minor modifications. Briefly, BSRT7-5 cells were grown in six-well plates to 80% confluency. Four hours before transfection, the cells were washed, and fresh antibiotic-free medium was added. For transfection, 8 \u00b5L of P3000 reagent, 2 \u00b5g of L plasmid and 1 \u00b5g each of S1 and S2 plasmids were diluted in 250 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen-Life Technologies) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

Then, at 48, 72, and 96 h post transfection, cell supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Different monovalent and bivalent vector viruses were generated as detailed in Table 2. The resultant viral recovery was confirmed by observing the green fluorescence of GFP in inoculated cell culture. The rescued virus was then grown in BHK-21 cells, and the GFP green fluorescence was observed. The expression of reovirus genes by the recombinant PICV vaccine virus was verified by RT-PCR assay."

Recombinant PICV expressing the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of influenza initiated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and provided full protection against lethal influenza in mice [16]. Several subunit vaccines reported against chicken reovirus and duck reovirus involve expression of the \u03c3C protein alone or in combination with \u03c3B proteins [12,13,14,15]. The purpose of this study was to develop recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines that carry S1 and/or S3 genes of turkey arthritis reoviruses. We successfully recovered recombinant PICV after insertion of TARV genomic segments in the PICV plasmids, detected the inserted genes, and confirmed the expression of recombinant antigenic proteins.",

We used the wild-type genes from three different TARV isolates in addition to codon-optimized genes from one TARV isolate in an effort to find an optimum TARV candidate to be used in developing a vaccine. The recovered PICV recombinants grew well in BHK-21 cells but showed minimal growth on QT-35 and LMH cells as determined by the expression of GFP in recombinant PICV that contained each of the TARV genes and the GFP gene. No GFP gene was inserted in the bivalent recombinant PICV (containing both S1 and S3 genes of TARV) and, hence, they could not be subjected to the green fluorescence test. We assume that these viruses grew the same way as the monovalent viruses because their plasmids and transfection were done under the same conditions. The detection of the inserted genes and the protein expression was helpful in determining the successful rescue and growth of the bivalent PICV-based TARV vaccines. The use of RT-PCR to detect the inserted TARV genome in recovered viruses helped in determining the success of recovering recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines that contained TARV S1 and/or S3 genes.",
                "To confirm the expression of reoviral antigenic proteins by the recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines, we used the direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFA) using FITC-conjugated anti-avian reovirus antibodies. The FA procedure included dehydration and long fixation with acetone. These two steps helped eliminate GFP fluorescence and increased permeabilization of the cell membrane. The permeabilization of the cell membrane enabled the entrance of the FITC-conjugated antibody to reach the intracellular recombinant viral proteins. Although we did not have a quantitative method to measure the amount of the expressed protein, we could subjectively observe that the fluorescence produced by viruses recombined with SKM121 genes was more than that produced by SKM73 and SKM95. The bivalent PICV-based TARV vaccines that contained codon-optimized S1 and S3 of SKM121 showed the best fluorescence, indicating the growth of these viruses, which did not have any GFP fluorescence after transfection.",
                "Since codon-optimized PICV-based TARV SKM121 vaccines showed the best expression of TARV S1 and/or S3 proteins, we used these vaccines for a pilot in vivo experiment. PICV without an insertion of TARV gene was used as a control. The in vivo experiment was to determine the safety and humoral response generated by the recombinant vaccines in turkey poults. Turkey poults were vaccinated with the same dose of vaccine (0.3 mL, 3 \u00d7 105 PFU/mL) via oral and intranasal route using a prime-boost strategy. Poults were primed at 1 week of age because birds are susceptible to avian reovirus infection in the early days of their life [22,23]; hence, vaccination strategies are designed to provide passive immunity from maternal antibodies by vaccinating breeders or by actively immunizing young bids with a live vaccine [24]. Priming at 1 week of age was also considered to avoid vaccination shock and poor intestinal immunity in day old birds [24]. Booster dose was given intranasally at 3 weeks of age, targeting the coarse spray administration with the same vaccine as previously described [25]. The booster vaccination was done after 2 weeks of priming because the recombinant PICV-based vaccine needs 2\u20133 weeks to provoke the best immune responses. Immunogenicity of the codon-optimized bivalent PICV-based TARV SKM121 vaccine was demonstrated by the production of high SN antibody titers. In future in vivo experiments, we plan to further characterize the effect of the dose of the recombinant PICV-based TARV vaccines on antibody titer and response to reovirus challenge in turkeys, as well as to study the efficacy of protection of the PICV-based TARV vaccines against heterologous and homologous challenge viruses."
