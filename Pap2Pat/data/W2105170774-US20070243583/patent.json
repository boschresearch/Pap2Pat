Similar to DsbC, such de novo designed chimeric (hybrid) FkpA-DsbA enzymes function, as disulfide reductases, oxidases, or isomerases, and chaperones in vivo and in vitro, despite lacking similarity toDsbC-related polypeptide sequence.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The invention generally concerns the field of molecular biology. More specifically, the invention relates to methods and compositions for efficient expression of polypeptides comprising disulfide linkages.",
                        "2. Description of Related Art",
                        "Oxidative protein folding involves two complementary but competing processes: cysteine thiol oxidation, and isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds. The limiting step in the folding of multi disulfide eukaryotic proteins in the bacterial periplasm is often the isomerization of non-native disulfides.",
                        "The bacterial disulfide bond formation (\u201cDsb\u201d) protein family consists of two distinct pathways, DsbA-DsbB, and DsbC/DsbG-DsbD, involved in the formation of disulfides and in the rearrangement of incorrectly formed bonds, respectively (Kadokura et al., 2003; Collet and Bardwell, 2002). The extreme oxidizing nature of mature DsbA (SEQ ID NO:3) mediates rapid oxidation of substrate cysteines, which results in the formation of non-native disulfides, in turn rearranged by DsbC. Consequently, despite the strong oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space, DsbC has to be maintained in a reduced state to interact with the substrate oxidized cysteines (Kadokura et al., 2003; Collet and Bardwell, 2002). To carry on their catalytic activities, DsbA and DsbC are maintained, respectively, in entirely oxidized and reduced states (Ramm and Pluckthun, 2001). DsbA is recycled by the membrane protein DsbB, whereas DsbC is maintained in the reduced state by the membrane protein, DsbD (Arie et al., 2001). Interactions between the two pathways are strongly prevented by kinetic constraints (Rozhkova et al., 2004). As a result, the strong thiol oxidant DsbA, and the strong thiol reductant DsbC, despite coexisting in the same cellular environment, do not appear to exchange electrons with each other, but instead act synergistically during oxidative protein folding. Remarkably, the catalytic domains of DsbC and DsbA show a considerable degree of structural homology, and they both contain a CXXC thioredoxin active site motif for the catalysis of disulfide exchange reactions.",
                        "The folding of at least three native proteins, namely the periplasmic acid phosphatase AppA or phytase, the peptidoglycan amidase MepA, and RNase I have been shown to depend on the presence of DsbC (Berkmen et al., 2005). In addition, the folding of a number of heterologous proteins has been shown to require overexpression of DsbC (Kadokura et al., 2003; Collet and Bardwell, 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Kurokawa et al., 2001). It was previously shown that the yield of active vtPA, a truncated version of human tissue plasminogen activator containing 9 disulfide bonds, depends on the DsbC expression level (Qiu et al., 1998).",
                        "Zhao et al. (2003) created several engineered polypeptides containing an N-terminal DsbC domain joined to a C-terminal domain from thioredoxin (Trx), DsbA, or portions of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). These polypeptides displayed limited isomerase and reductase activities while retaining DsbC-related sequences. It was suggested that the basis of the catalytic activity of DsbC resides in its V-shaped dimeric structure, which allows for the formation of a hydrophobic substrate binding cleft with chaperone activity, and in the presence of two catalytic thioredoxin domains (Segatori et al., 2004). The hybrid DsbC-DsbA or DsbC-TrxA polypeptides described in Segatori et al., 2004, in which the catalytic domain of DsbC had been replaced with DsbA, also displayed disulfide bond formation and isomerase activity, and afforded vtPA yields comparable to those obtained when overexpressing wild-type DsbC under the same conditions. However, the chimeric proteins of Zhao et al. and Segatori et al. each retain DsbC-derived sequences.",
                        "The E. coli periplasm contains two classes of enzymes that assist the folding of proteins by catalyzing covalent modification: enzymes that catalyze the reduction and oxidation of disulfide bonds (the Dsb family), and enzymes that catalyze cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization reactions (PPIases) (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). Among the PPIases (E.C. 5.2.1.8), which include SurA (Behrens et al., 2001) and the FK506 binding proteins (FKBP's), an FkpA (e.g., GenBank L28082) has been recently biochemically characterized, and its crystal structure has been solved (Saul et al., 2004). FkpA is a homodimeric V-shaped protein (e.g., FIG. 1) which exhibits a similar gross topology to DsbC. Each monomer in FkpA is formed by an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, joined by a long \u03b1-helical linker. The two domains are each structurally and functionally independent. The dimerization domains form a binding pocket for the interaction with the substrate, and have been shown to have chaperone activity (Saul et al., 2004; Ramm and Pluckthun, 2001; Arie et al., 2001). FkpA and DsbC lack substantial amino acid sequence identity (e.g., using BLAST with default parameters). There exists a need for methods to catalyze disulfide bond formation and isomerization in bacteria without the expression of a DsbC-containing protein."

                        "The folding of multi-disulfide containing proteins in the periplasm of E. coli occurs through the rapid, non-specific oxidation of cysteines by DsbA, and is limited by the need for subsequent isomerization of non-native disulfides (Berkmen et al., 2005; Zapun et al., 1993). To overcome this limitation, the present invention provides, in specific embodiments, artificial disulfide isomerases that: (1) can catalyze the folding of multi-disulfide proteins expressed in bacteria or other organisms and (2) comprise unique amino acid sequences that that form proteins not found in any naturally occurring disulfide isomerase.",
                        "The present invention describes the construction of artificial enzymes comprising an N-terminal domain derived from FkpA that allows for dimerization and provides a substrate binding region, and a C-terminal thioredoxin domain derived from DsbA. The ability of such chimeric (hybrid) designed enzymes to function as disulfide isomerases in vivo, and their in vitro characterization, was demonstrated. The work described below shows that FkpA-DsbA chimeras, although lacking any DsbC sequences, result in vtPA yields comparable to those provided by wild-type DsbC. In particular, FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, and FkpA-DsbA4 supported the folding of vtPA with yields 80, 55, and 67% of the yield of active protein obtained with wild-type DsbC (FIG. 2A). In addition, only background levels of active vtPA were detected in cells lacking DsbD, and expressing any of the FkpA-DsbA chimeras. Without being bound by any theory, this suggests that the activity of the chimera proteins depends on their recycling by DsbD and leads to the rearrangement of non-native disulfide bonds.",

Electroporation can be extremely efficient and can be used both for transient expression of cloned genes and for establishment of cell lines that carry integrated copies of a gene of interest.

As is well-known, operative links between such DNA sequences mean that a translational fusion exists between the heterologous protein and the signal peptide. As a rule, such signal peptides form the N-terminal portion of the secreted heterologous protein. Signal sequences which promote protein translocation to the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacterial are well-known, as exemplified by those described herein.

In the tk promoter, the spacing between elements can be increased to 50 bp apart before activity begins to decline. Depending on the promoter, it appears that individual elements can function either cooperatively or independently to activate transcription.",

The SOE procedure involves a two-step PCR protocol, in which a complementary pair of internal primers (B and C) are used to introduce the appropriate nucleotide changes into the wild-type sequence. In two separate reactions, flanking PCR primer A (restriction site incorporated into the oligo) and primer D (restriction site incorporated into the oligo) are used in conjunction with primers B and C, respectively to generate PCR products AB and CD. The PCR products are purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and the two overlapping PCR fragments AB and CD are combined with flanking primers A and D and used in a second PCR reaction.

Since it is the interactive capacity and nature of a protein that defines that protein's biological functional activity, certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a protein sequence, and, of course, its underlying DNA coding sequence, and nevertheless obtain a protein with like properties. It is thus contemplated by the inventors that various changes may be made in the peptide sequences of the disclosed compositions, or corresponding DNA sequences which encode said peptides without appreciable loss of their biological utility or activity.",
                        "In making such changes, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biologic function on a protein is generally understood in the art (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of the amino acid contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein, which in turn defines the interaction of the protein with other molecules, for example, enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, and the like. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of their hydrophobicity and charge characteristics (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982), these are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (\u22120.4); threonine (\u22120.7); serine (\u22120.8); tryptophan (\u22120.9); tyrosine (\u22121.3); proline (\u22121.6); histidine (\u22123.2); glutamate (\u22123.5); glutamine (\u22123.5); aspartate (\u22123.5); asparagine (\u22123.5); lysine (\u22123.9); and arginine (\u22124.5).",
                        "It is known in the art that certain amino acids may be substituted by other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still result in a protein with similar biological activity, ie. still obtain a biological functionally equivalent protein. In making such changes, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within \u00b12 is preferred, those which are within \u00b11 are particularly preferred, and those within \u00b10.5 are even more particularly preferred. It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, states that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein.",
                        "As detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, the following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0\u00b11); glutamate (+3.0\u00b11); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (\u22120.4); proline (\u22120.5\u00b11); alanine (\u22120.5); histidine (\u22120.5); cysteine (\u22121.0); methionine (\u22121.3); valine (\u22121.5); leucine (\u22121.8); isoleucine (\u22121.8); tyrosine (\u22122.3); phenylalanine (\u22122.5); tryptophan (\u22123.4). It is understood that an amino acid can be substituted for another having a similar hydrophilicity value and still obtain a biologically equivalent, and in particular, an immunologically equivalent protein. In such changes, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within \u00b12 is preferred, those which are within \u00b10.1 are particularly preferred, and those within \u00b10.5 are even more particularly preferred.",
                        "As outlined above, amino acid substitutions are generally therefore based on the relative similarity of the amino acid side-chain substituents, for example, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and the like. Exemplary substitutions which take various of the foregoing characteristics into consideration are well known to those of skill in the art and include: arginine and lysine; glutamate and aspartate; serine and threonine; glutamine and asparagine; and valine, leucine and isoleucine."

                                "In one embodiment of the invention, expression of a hybrid disulfide bond isomerase gene may be induced prior to heterologous gene expression. The heterologous polypeptide and the FkpA-DsbA hybrid (chimera) polypeptide may be secreted into the periplasm, or the heterologous polypeptide may be secreted into the culture medium of the bacteria which may also contain a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide is recovered from the periplasm of the bacteria.",
                                "The fkpA and dsbA genes used to create the FkpA-DsbA chimera may be derived from any bacterial source, e.g., from E. coli. A gene encoding the chimera polypeptide may be separately placed from a gene encoding a heterologous polypeptide if the nucleic acids are on the same vector. In addition, the nucleic acid encoding the FkpA-DsbA hybrid and the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide will often be under separate, different inducible promoters so that induction of expression can occur in the required sequential order. The nucleic acid encoding the FkpA-DsbA chimera and the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide may be integrated into the host cell genome or contained on autonomously replicating plasmids.",
                                "In one embodiment, the bacteria comprises two separate vectors respectively containing the nucleic acid encoding the engineered FkpA-DsbA chimera polypeptide and the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide.",
                                "In another embodiment, the nucleic acid encoding the FkpA-DsbA chimera polypeptide and the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide are contained on the same vector but are under the control of separate inducible promoters and separate signal sequences.",
                                "In a third embodiment, the nucleic acid encoding the FkpA-DsbA chimera polypeptide and the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide are contained on the same vector and are under the control of a single promoter.",
                                "In a fourth embodiment the FkpA and DsbA domains of the disulfide isomerase are encoded by different vectors. Each of the FkpA and DsbA proteins are expressed as fusions to dimerizing domains such as those derived from well known heterodimeric leucine zipper (e.g., from the transcriptiona activator SCN4). The FkpA and DsbA fusions to the respective halves of the leucine zipper associate in the bacterial periplasm to form a protein, comprising of four polypeptides: two FkpA chains that associate with two DsbA chains via leucine zipper interactions.",
                                "The heterologous nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) can be suitably inserted into a replicable vector for expression in the bacterium under the control of a suitable promoter for bacteria. Many vectors are available for this purpose, and selection of the appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acid to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function (amplification of DNA or expression of DNA) and the particular host cell with which it is compatible. The vector components for bacterial transformation generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, and an inducible promoter.",
                                "In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with bacterial hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli may be transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species (see, e.g., Bolivar et al., 1977). pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. The pBR322 plasmid, or other microbial plasmid or phage, also generally contains, or is modified to contain, promoters that can be used by the microbial organism for expression of the selectable marker genes.",
                                "The DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest herein may be expressed not only directly, but also as a fusion with another polypeptide, preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The heterologous signal sequence selected should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For bacterial host cells that do not recognize and process the native polypeptide signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a bacterial signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, 1pp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders.",
                                "Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria.",
                                "Expression and cloning vectors also generally contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. This gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli. One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen.",
                                "The expression vector for producing a heterologous polypeptide may also contain an inducible promoter that is recognized by the host bacterial organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of interest. It may also contain a separate inducible promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the FkpA-DsbA chimera. Inducible promoters suitable for use with bacterial hosts include the \u03b2-lactamase and lactose (lac) promoter systems (Chang et al., 1978; Goeddel et al., 1979), the arabinose (ara) promoter system (Guzman et al., 1995), alkaline phosphatase (phoA), a tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel, 1980; Eur. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. EP 36,776), \u03bbPL promoter, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial inducible promoters are suitable. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker to operably ligate them to DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest or to the fkpA-dsbA hybrid gene (Siebenlist et al., 1980) using linkers or adaptors or other methods to supply any required restriction sites.",
                                "Promoters for use in bacterial systems also generally contain a Shine-Dalgamo (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest. The promoter can be removed from the bacterial source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserted into the vector containing the desired DNA. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above-listed components employs standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and re-ligated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required.",
                                "Suitable bacteria for this purpose include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, especially Eubacteria, and most preferably Enterobacteriaceae. Examples of useful bacteria include Escherichia, Enterobacter, Azotobacter, Erwinia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia, Shigella, Rhizobia, and Paracoccus. Suitable E. coli hosts include E. coli SF110, E. coli 294 (ATCC 31446), E. coli B, and E. coli \u03c71776 (ATCC 31537). These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Mutant cells of any of the above-mentioned bacteria may also be employed, including ones that display an altered redox potential in their periplasm and/or cytoplasm. It is, of course, necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon.",
                                "Host cells can be transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.",
                                "Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO4 and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.",
                                "Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation can be done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of Sambrook et al., (1989), is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another method is the use of the technique termed electroporation.",
                                "Bacterial cells used to produce the polypeptide of interest for purposes of this invention can be cultured in suitable media in which the promoters for the nucleic acid encoding the heterologous polypeptide and for the nucleic acid encoding DsbC can be artificially induced as described generally, e.g., in Sambrook et al. (1989). Examples of suitable media are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,304,472 and 5,342,763.",
                                "Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. The pH of the medium may be any pH from about 5-9, depending mainly on the host organism. Preferably, the medium contains no reduced glutathione, and the bacteria are not cultured so as to over-express nucleic acid encoding the heat-shock transcription factor, RpoH.",
                                "Gene expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, 1980). Various labels may be employed, most commonly radioisotopes, particularly 32P. However, other techniques may also be employed, such as using biotin-modified nucleotides for introduction into a polynucleotide. The biotin then serves as the site for binding to avidin or antibodies, which may be labeled with a wide variety of labels, such as radionuclides, fluorescers, enzymes, or the like. Alternatively gene expression may be measured based on the activity of the protein that is being produced.",
                                "Procedures for observing whether an expressed or over-expressed gene product is secreted are readily available to the skilled practitioner. Once the culture medium is separated from the host cells, for example, by centrifugation or filtration, the gene product can then be detected in the cell-free culture medium by taking advantage of known properties characteristic of the gene product. Such properties can include the distinct immunological, enzymatic, or physical properties of the gene product.",
                                "For example, if an over-expressed gene product has a unique enzyme activity, an assay for that activity can be performed on the culture medium used by the host cells. Moreover, when antibodies reactive against a given gene product are available, such antibodies can be used to detect the gene product in any known immunological assay (e.g., as in Harlow and Lane, 1988).",
                                "The secreted gene product can also be detected using tests that distinguish polypeptides on the basis of characteristic physical properties such as molecular weight. To detect the physical properties of the gene product, all polypeptides newly synthesized by the host cell can be labeled, e.g., with a radioisotope. Common radioisotopes that can be used to label polypeptides synthesized within a host cell include tritium (3H), carbon-14 (14C), sulfur-35 (35S), and the like. For example, the host cell can be grown in 35S-methionine or 35S-cysteine medium, and a significant amount of the 35S label will be preferentially incorporated into any newly synthesized polypeptide, including the over-expressed heterologous polypeptide. The 35S-containing culture medium is then removed and the cells are washed and placed in fresh non-radioactive culture medium. After the cells are maintained in the fresh medium for a time and under conditions sufficient to allow secretion of the 35S-radiolabeled expressed heterologous polypeptide, the culture medium is collected and separated from the host cells. The molecular weight of the secreted, labeled polypeptide in the culture medium can then be determined by known procedures, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Such procedures, and/or other procedures for detecting secreted gene products, are provided in Goeddel (1990), and Sambrook et al, (1989).",
                                "For secretion of an expressed or over-expressed gene product, the host cell is cultured under conditions sufficient for secretion of the gene product. Such conditions include, e.g., temperature, nutrient, and cell density conditions that permit secretion by the cell. Moreover, such conditions are those under which the cell can perform basic cellular functions of transcription, translation, and passage of proteins from one cellular compartment to another, as are known to those skilled in the art.",
                                "In practicing the process of this invention, the yield of biologically active polypeptide is generally increased, while yield of insoluble polypeptide is not changed or is decreased, i.e., yield of soluble and biologically active polypeptide is increased.",
                                "The polypeptide of interest may be recovered from the periplasm or culture medium as a secreted soluble polypeptide. It may be useful to purify the polypeptide of interest from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides and from the FkpA-DsbA hybrid protein to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous as to the polypeptide of interest. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate may be centrifuged to remove particulate cell debris. The membrane and soluble protein fractions may then be separated if necessary. The polypeptide may then be purified from the soluble protein fraction and from the membrane fraction of the culture lysate, depending on whether the polypeptide is membrane associated or, more preferably, completely soluble in the periplasm or culture supernatant. The polypeptide thereafter may be further solubilized and/or refolded, if necessary, and purified from contaminant soluble proteins and polypeptides.",
                                "Alternatively, expression of FkpA-DsbC without a signal sequence may be employed in conjunction with strains that have an oxidizing cytoplasm, such as the Origami\u2122 E. coli strains marketed by Novagen/EMD Biosciences (Madison, Wis.). In this strain background, protein disulfides are formed in cytoplasmic proteins and the artificial disulfide isomerase proteins disclosed herein allow an increase in the yield of the correctly folded and biologically active polypeptide."

                                "A study was undertaken for the de novo design of a protein able to assist the folding of multi disulfide containing proteins when overexpressed in the periplasm of E. coli. Engineered to contain no amino acid homology with the main bacterial protein disulfide isomerase DsbC, the rational design of this enzyme sought to recapitulate the essential features for bacterial disulfide isomerization. Previously, in fact, a number of complementary strategies for elucidating the molecular features of DsbC function have been investigated. In particular, it was hypothesized that the molecular requirements for a protein that can catalyze isomerization of non-native disulfides in vivo are: (i) the presence of a peptide binding cleft with chaperone activity, and (ii) the presence of two catalytic domains with a thioredoxin fold. In addition, the overall molecular topology of disulfide isomerases must depend on (iii) the relative orientation of the active sites, which is in turn influenced by the nature of the \u03b1-helical linker connecting the thioredoxin domain to the rest of molecule (Segatori et al., 2004).",
                                "Artificial enzymes were designed to resemble the gross topology of DsbC, i.e., a V-shaped homodimeric molecule that contains a region for the binding with the substrate between the arms of the V. FkpA is a homodimeric V-shaped protein with cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity in which each monomer is formed by an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, joined by a long \u03b1-helical linker. The two structural domains have been demonstrated to be stable on their own, and to function independently (Saul et al., 2004). In particular, the dimerization domain exhibits chaperone activity and it has been reported to form a binding pocket for the interaction with the substrate (Ramm and Pluckthun, 2001). A series of artificial enzymes were constructed, comprising the minimal FkpA N-terminal domain that has been shown to exhibit chaperone activity which includes a long \u03b1-helical liker at the C-terminus (Saul et al., 2004), fused to the DsbA molecule (FIG. 1).",

For protein purification purposes the gene fusions were digested with XbaI and HindIII, ligated into pET28a (Novagen, Madison Wis.) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells.",
                                "The FkpA polypeptide is a homodimeric V-shaped molecule with overall structural architecture (gross topology) similar to DsbC. Each monomer is composed of an N-terminal dimerization domain (residues 1-114; FIG. 1; SEQ ID NO:2) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 115-224) (FIG. 1). Residues 70-114 form a long \u03b1-helical linker that joins the two independent domains in each monomer. A series of fusions were constructed, encoding the dimerization domain, specifically residues 1-114 (SEQ ID NO:2) of FkpA fused to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th residue of mature DsbA (SEQ ID NO:3), termed DsbA(1-189); DsbA(2-189), DsbA(3-189), DsbA(4-189), and DsbA(5-189), along with a hexahistidine tag, respectively, generating the respective molecules FkpA-DsbA1 (SEQ ID NO:4), FkpA-DsbA2 (SEQ ID NO:5), FkpA-DsbA3 (SEQ ID NO:6), FkpA-DsbA4 (SEQ ID NO:7), and FkpA-DsbA5 (SEQ ID NO:8). Differences in the nature of the amino acid region joining the two structurally independent domains are presumed to result in different orientations of the portion of the chimera protein at the C-terminal of the helical linker, i.e., the catalytic active sites. Furthermore, it has been reported that the relative orientation of the active sites in the thioredoxin domains is crucial to the catalytic function of the molecule (Segatori et al., 2004). The fkpA-dsbA gene fusions were placed downstream from the arabinose promoter in the medium copy number plasmid pBAD33 (Guzman et al. 1995). Following induction of protein expression with arabinose, the wild-type DsbC and all the FkpA-DsbA chimeras accumulated to nearly identical levels, as determined by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the C-terminal His tag.",

Cultures were grown at 30\u00b0 C. in 15 ml of LB medium with 50 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin and 25 \u03bcg/ml of chloramphenicol. Cells were diluted 1:100 from overnight cultures, grown to OD600 of 0.8, and arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%; 30 min later, vtPA synthesis was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Following growth for three additional hours, 6 ml aliquots were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. The pellets were resuspended in cold PBS as needed to normalize the number of cells per sample, and lysed with a French press. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000\u00d7g, 10 min at 4\u00b0 C.), and the soluble protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. tPA activities were obtained by first diluting the samples in 50 mM Tris-terminal (pH 7.4) with 0.01% Tween 80 to a final protein concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/pl. 30 \u03bcl of the diluted cell lysates were added to 250 \u03bcl of the same buffer containing 0.04 \u03bcg/\u03bcl of human Glu-type plasminogen (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, Conn.), and 0.4 mM Spectrozyme PL (American Diagnostica), incubated at 37\u00b0 C., and the change in A405 was monitored. To study the in vivo oxidase activity of the chimeric proteins, E. coli LM106 (MC1000 dsbA::kan5) and LM102 (MC1000 dsbB::kan5) were transformed with the appropriate pBAD33 plasmid derivatives. Overnight cultures were grown in LB medium with 50 \u03bcg/ml of kanamycin and 25 \u03bcg/ml of chloramphenicol, and diluted 1:100 in low phosphate minimal medium containing MOPS salts, 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% glucose, 0.2% casein amino acids, and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml thiamine, with 50 \u03bcg/ml of kanamycin and 25 \u03bcg/ml of chloramphenicol. When the cell density reached OD600=0.4, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% w/v. Four hours later, cells were collected and mixed with 0.4 M iodoacetamide and lysis buffer (B-PER\u2122, Pierce) in a 1:2 ratio.

Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 18-22 hours.",
                                "In vivo studies revealed that the FkpA-DsbA chimeras constructed are able to catalyze the rearrangement of non-native disulfide bonds. Three of the enzymes, namely FkpA fused to the DsbA molecule starting from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th amino acid residues, were able to assist the folding of vtPA in the periplasm of E. coli to degrees comparable to the yield of active vtPA obtained overexpressing wild-type DsbC (FIG. 2A). Thus the constructed artificial enzymes are disulfide isomerases in vivo. Moreover, the ability of these artificial enzymes to act as isomerases was dependent on the presence of DsbD, demonstrating that their catalytic domains are able to interact with DsbD and depend on it for their recycling.",
                                "Although DsbD is able to reduce the monomeric DsbA extremely slowly in vitro (Rozhkova et al., 2004), the steric interactions created by dimerization of DsbA allow for the reduction of the artificial disulfide isomerases by DsbD in vivo. From gel filtration analysis of the purified proteins, it was observed that all the artificial disulfide isomerases are present exclusively as dimers. Because the in vivo folding of active vtPA was analyzed in an E. coli strain where DsbC is expressed in the periplasm from the chromosomal gene, the possibility that heterodimeric molecules generated by interaction between the dimerization domains of a wild-type DsbC monomer and of an FkpA-DsbA monomer has not been ruled out. However, the probability of this scenario is unlikely, in that the formation of such heterodimers would not significantly increase the yield of active vtPA with respect to the yield obtained in the background strain, in which the amount of periplasmic DsbC derives only from the chromosomal copy of the gene. In addition, the same study was performed in an overexpressing mutant of the FkpA-DsbA3 enzyme (with DsbC as a control), where the N-terminal cysteine in the CXXC active site was substituted with an alanine, to inactivate the oxidoreductase activity of the molecule. This substitution completely impaired the enzymes' ability to assist the in vivo folding of vtPA, thus the possibility that the high chaperone activity of FkpA is responsible for the folding of vtPA can be ruled out.",
                                "The ability of the artificial disulfide isomerases to simultaneously catalyze oxidase activity and rearrangement of non-native disulfides in vivo (i.e., assist the folding of vtPA in a dsbA\u2212 background) was observed to be strictly correlated with their ability to complement for the lack of DsbA, and restore alkaline phosphatase activity. In other words, we showed that the catalysis of disulfide bond formation during the folding of vtPA in dsbA\u2212 cells overexpressing the FkpA-DsbA chimeras could be attributed to their in vivo oxidase activity, in a DsbB-dependent fashion. For instance the artificial disulfide isomerase that displays the highest oxidase activity, FkpA-DsbA3, was also shown to assist the folding of vtPA in a dsbA background strain (FIG. 2A). This suggests that the particular nature of the linker joining the two domains in each monomer influences the orientation of the active sites allowing for the reduction by DsbD and oxidation by DsbB in the periplasm of the same cell. Likewise, the moderate degree of isomerase activity exhibited by FkpA-DsbA2 and FkpA-DsbA4 in a dsbA\u2212 background (FIG. 2A) is presumably due to the limited ability of these enzymes to be oxidized by DsbB (FIG. 2B). The nature of the \u03b1-helical linker may affect the orientation of the catalytic domains, and the propensity of the molecule to be oxidized by DsbB. As a result, since the degree of in vivo oxidation is correlated to the amount of protein found in the oxidized state in the periplasmic space, the ability of the enzymes to catalyze the folding of vtPA in a dsbA\u2212 strain is dependent on their oxidase activity.",

Protein expression and purification was performed as previously described (Segatori et al., 2004). The FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, FkpA-DsbA4, and FkpA-DsbA5 chimeras, and DsbC as a control were purified by IMAC chromatography and their oligomerization status was analyzed by gel filtration FPLC. All the proteins eluted exclusively as dimers (e.g., FIG. 3). All proteins used in this study were more than 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels.",
                                "The rate of insulin reduction in the presence of DTT was determined as previously described (Holmgren 1979). The change of A650 in the reaction was monitored as a direct measure of the aggregation of reduced insulin, and the activity is expressed as the ratio of the initial slope of the turbidity curve to the lag time (Martinez-Galisteo et al., 1995). The renaturation of reduced, denatured RNase A was determined as described by Lyles and Gilbert (Lyles and Gilbert, 1991). The protection of citrate synthase from thermal inactivation was monitored according to Buchner et al., 1998. The rate of thermal inactivation obtained with or without 0.4 \u03bcM of purified enzymes was determined.",

As shown in table 3, a dsbA-dsbC E. coli mutant strain lacking DsbC fails to grow in the presence of \u22674 mM CuCl2. However, the presence of a chimeric FkpADsbA protein allowed growth in the presence of 5-8 mM CuCl2.",
                                "The intrinsic isomerase activity of the artificial disulfide isomerases was determined using RNase A as a substrate (Lyles and Gilbert, 1991). Interestingly, the artificial enzymes displayed low in vitro isomerase activity which was only 15-21% of that of DsbC (Table 4).",
                                "This suggests that the artificial disulfide isomerases, similarly to the DsbC-DsbA chimeras (Segatori et al., 2004), might catalyze the rearrangement of non-native disulfides by cycles of reduction and oxidation of the substrate, rather than by mere catalysis of isomerization. As shown in FIG. 2B, FkpA-DsbA1 completely resists the oxidation by DsbB, and is therefore most likely present in the periplasm in a completely reduced state. In agreement with the conclusion suggested above, the yield of active vtPA observed when FkpA-DsbA1 is overexpressed in the periplasm of a dsbA+ bacterial strain is only slightly higher than the value obtained for the background strain. Likewise, FkpA-DsbA5 moderate oxidase activity is consistent with its limited isomerase activity in vivo. Finally, without wishing to be bound by any theory, the higher propensity of FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, and FkpA-DsbA4 to be oxidized by DsbB suggests that the fraction of these enzymes present in the oxidized state is sufficient to catalyze the folding of vtPA in a dsbA+ strain through cycles of reduction and oxidation. However, in dsbA\u2212 cells, the artificial disulfide isomerases need to catalyze both oxidation and rearrangement of disulfides. In this setting, the timing of oxidation and reduction cycles becomes more stringent, and, without being bound by any theory, it is proposed that the steric hindrance generated by the specific orientation of the catalytic domains in the FkpA-DsbA2 and FkpA-DsbA4 molecules (as opposed to FkpA-DsbA3) delays the interaction with the substrate, or the recycling by DsbB and DsbD, resulting in sub-optimal timing of in vivo folding.",
                                "The in vitro insulin reduction activity (Zhao et al., 2003) of the FkpA-DsbA chimeras was 7-10% of that of DsbC (Table 4). For comparison, DsbA has about 10% of the activity of DsbC in this assay (Segatori et al., 2004). All the chimeras exhibited low disulfide isomerase activity in the refolding of reduced RNAse A. FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, FkpA-DsbA4, and FkpA-DsbA5, and DsbCd\u03b1N-TrxA displayed from 15 to 21% of the isomerase activity of DsbC, which in turn was 8-fold less active than protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI; EC 5.3.4.1). Without wishing to be bound by theory, one explanation is that because the \u03b1-helical linker in the FkpA-DsbA molecules is considerably longer than that of DsbC, the two catalytic domains are kept more separated in the overall three-dimensional structure of the artificial enzymes, and, as a result, in vitro, they act on the specific substrate used in this assay, insulin, as two monomeric DsbA. This suggests that the reduction of insulin may not be an accurate measure of the reductase activity on the periplasm. Similarly to what was observed in the refolding of RNAse A, the reduction of insulin is a measurement of the enzymes reductase activity per se, which therefore does not consider the outcome of possible in vivo interactions.",
                                "Analysis of the artificial molecules in vitro chaperone activity was performed using citrate synthase as a substrate, and monitoring the ability of the artificial enzymes to prevent the inactivation of citrate synthase by thermal denaturation (Table 4). The chaperone activity of all of the artificial disulfide bond isomerases was found to be comparable to that of DsbC. The half-life of denaturated CS is used as an indication of the enzyme chaperone activity. At a 2.7 fold stoichiometric excess, the half-life of CS incubated with FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, FkpA-DsbA4, and FkpA-DsbA5 was observed to be respectively 0.8, 0.6, 1.2, and 0.9-fold the value obtained using DsbC as a chaperone (Table 4).",

                                "The catalytic domain of the FkpA-DsbA chimera polypeptides is represented by the DsbA portion of the polypeptide. This raises the possibility that these molecules could simultaneously catalyze the oxidation and the rearrangement of non-native disulfide bonds in dsbA cells, lacking DsbA. The folding of vtPA, in addition to requiring the overexpression of DsbC, is also dependent on the presence of a protein oxidant, namely DsbA. Therefore, in strain SF100 (Baneyx and Georgiou, 1990) lacking DsbA, only background levels of active vtPA are observed. Multicopy expression of DsbC, in this strain background, also failed to yield active vtPA, since DsbC cannot serve as an efficient protein oxidant (FIG. 2A). In contrast, it was found that expression of one of the artificial disulfide isomerases, FkpA-DsbA3, afforded the same yield of active vtPA in cells with or without DsbA. The level of vtPA activity in this case was 13-fold higher than in dsbA cells without plasmid. Thus, activity of this hybrid isomerase variant was not affected by the absence of DsbA. The other FkpA-DsbA chimeras showed weak vtPA folding activity in dsbA cells (FIG. 2A).",
                                "To verify that the ability of the chimeras to assist the folding of vtPA in a dsbA background depends on these molecules' oxidase activity, their ability to complement the phenotypes caused by the absence of DsbA was examined. In particular, dsbA mutant strains display very low alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) activity. Similarly to DsbC, FkpA-DsbA1 which did not give vtPA activity above background in a dsbA host was also not able to catalyze the formation of enzymatically active PhoA in MC4100 dsbA cells (FIG. 2B). However, the other four FkpA-DsbA variants were able to support protein oxidation to various degrees. In E. coli MC1000 dsbA grown in low phosphate media, the PhoA activity is 30-fold lower than in its isogenic parent. Co-expression of FkpA-DsbA2, FkpA-DsbA3, FkpA-DsbA4, and FkpA-DsbA5 restored PhoA activity to respectively 43, 67, 35, and 28% of the value obtained in the parental strain MC1000 (FIG. 2B). None of the FkpA-DsbA chimeras could restore PhoA activity in dsbB cells (FIG. 2B), suggesting that the oxidase activity observed in dsbA cells is dependent on the oxidation of the FkpA-DsbA chimeras by DsbB.",
