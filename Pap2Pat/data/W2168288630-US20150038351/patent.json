                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The invention relates to the field of diagnostic and prognostic methods of human cancers, especially breast cancer, arising from low-dose radiation exposure and the risk of survival in women once they have been diagnosed with breast cancer.",
                        "2. Related Art",
                        "Once a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, there is great uncertainty and variation in the chances of survival, which can be measured as disease free survival (DFS). Advanced genomic technologies provide a means to use the expression profile of tumor and nearby normal tissue to develop signatures of risks and protection for DFS and other measures of survival.",
                        "For example, human population exposures to low-dose ionizing radiation (LD, <10 cGy) are a growing medical and public health concern due to the increasing use in medical diagnostics, therapies, security screening, and exposure to emissions from nuclear power generation and unexpected events. The human breast is sensitive to radiation-induced cancer after higher doses (Mole R H (1978) The sensitivity of the human breast to cancer induction by ionizing radiation. Br J Radiol 51: 401-405) with risks depending on exposure regimen, age at exposure, and genetic background (Boice J D, Jr., Harvey E B, Blettner M, Stovall M, Flannery J T (1992) Cancer in the contralateral breast after radiotherapy for breast cancer. N Engl J Med 326: 781-785; Hancock S L, Tucker M A, Hoppe R T (1993) Breast cancer after treatment of Hodgkin's disease. J Natl Cancer Inst 85: 25-31). However, we know remarkably little of the molecular tissue responses after LD exposures, of response mechanisms that may be protective or risky for cancer, and how individuals may vary in their tissue repair and cancer risks. The consequences of these gaps in knowledge are not trivial and there can be serious public misconceptions and fears as dramatically illustrated in Japan and the rest of the world after the radiation releases from the Fukushima reactor complex after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of 2011.",
                        "Advanced genomic technologies have demonstrated the rich molecular responses in cells and tissues exposed to LD radiation in transcriptome, metabolome, epigenome, proteome and other omics. We have learned that LD responses can vary dramatically with genetic backgrounds and that there is very little overlap between LD and HD responses at the level of genes, pathways, networks, and functions (Coleman M A, Yin E, Peterson L E, Nelson D, Sorensen K, et al. (2005) Low-dose irradiation alters the transcript profiles of human lymphoblastoid cells including genes associated with cytogenetic radioadaptive response. Radiat Res 164: 369-382; Lowe X R, Bhattacharya S, Marchetti F, Wyrobek A J (2009) Early brain response to low-dose radiation exposure involves molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease. Radiat Res 171: 53-65; Nguyen D H, Oketch-Rabah H A, Illa-Bochaca I, Geyer F C, Reis-Filho J S, et al. (2011) Radiation Acts on the Microenvironment to Affect Breast Carcinogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms that Decrease Cancer Latency and Affect Tumor Type. Cancer Cell 19: 640-651; Wyrobek A J, Manohar C F, Krishnan V V, Nelson D O, Furtado M R, et al. (2011) Low dose radiation response curves, networks and pathways in human lymphoblastoid cells exposed from 1 to 10 cGy of acute gamma radiation. Mutat Res 722: 119-130). Although the linear-no-threshold (LNT) model remains the regulatory standard for estimating LD risks (Health Risks From Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation BEIR VII Phase 2. (2006) Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press), it is under increasing scientific challenge because of the mounting evidence that many, and maybe most, cellular and tissue responses are not linear into the LD range (Wyrobek A J, Manohar C F, Krishnan V V, Nelson D O, Furtado M R, et al. (2011) Low dose radiation response curves, networks and pathways in human lymphoblastoid cells exposed from 1 to 10 cGy of acute gamma radiation. Mutat Res 722: 119-130; Neumaier T, Swenson J, Pham C, Polyzos A, Lo A T, et al. Evidence for formation of DNA repair centers and dose-response nonlinearity in human cells. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109: 443-448). Dose rate is also an important variable for risk, with fractionated LD and adaptive response regimens providing protection against radiation-induced cell damage, genomic damage, and cancer endpoints (Ina Y, Tanooka H, Yamada T, Sakai K (2005) Suppression of thymic lymphoma induction by life-long low-dose-rate irradiation accompanied by immune activation in C57BL/6 mice. Radiat Res 163: 153-158; Olivieri G, Bodycote J, Wolff S (1984) Adaptive response of human lymphocytes to low concentrations of radioactive thymidine. Science 223: 594-597; Ullrich R L, Jernigan M C, Satterfield L C, Bowles N D (1987) Radiation carcinogenesis: time-dose relationships. Radiat Res 111: 179-184; Wolff S (1998) The adaptive response in radiobiology: evolving insights and implications. Environ Health Perspect 106 Suppl 1: 277-283). In the mammary glands (MG) of mice, lifetime tumor incidence was associated with how the exposure was fractionated, ranging from full protection to additivity of risk (Ullrich R L et al., (1987) Radiat Res 111: 179-1). In the mouse p53-null chimera model, 10 cGy LD exposure to the MG stroma reduced tumor latency, suggesting that LD altered the tissue microenvironment (Nguyen D H, Oketch-Rabah H A, Illa-Bochaca I, Geyer F C, Reis-Filho J S, et al. (2011) Radiation Acts on the Microenvironment to Affect Breast Carcinogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms that Decrease Cancer Latency and Affect Tumor Type. Cancer Cell 19: 640-651), although 50 cGy did not show this effect, warranting further inquiry. While LD expression studies (see references above) have provided evidence for conserved as well as cell-type specific low-dose responses, the roles of genetic background on resulting tissue damage and down-stream cancer risks remain poorly understood."

As used herein, a \u201cgene set forth in\u201d a table or a panel or a \u201cgene identified in\u201d a table, and the like, are used interchangeably to refer to the gene that is listed in that table. For example, a gene \u201cidentified in\u201d Table 9 refers to the gene that corresponds to the gene listed in Table 9. As understood in the art, there are naturally occurring polymorphisms for many gene sequences. Genes that are naturally occurring allelic variations for the purposes of this invention are those genes encoded by the same genetic locus. The proteins encoded by allelic variations of any gene set forth in Table 2 (or in any of Tables 2, 9 or Table 10-11) typically have at least 95% amino acid sequence identity to one another, i.e., an allelic variant of a gene indicated in Table 2 typically encodes a protein product that has at least 95% identity, often at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, or greater, identity to the amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence denoted by the Entrez Gene ID number (as of Sep. 12, 2012 for Tables 2 and 9 genes and as of Mar. 15, 2013 for Tables 10-11 genes) shown in Table 2 for that gene.

One method for detection of amplification products is the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease \u201chydrolysis\u201d PCR assay (also referred to as the TaqMan\u2122 assay) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,210,015 and 5,487,972; Holland et al., PNAS USA 88: 7276-7280 (1991); Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21: 3761-3766 (1993)). This assay detects the accumulation of a specific PCR product by hybridization and cleavage of a doubly labeled fluorogenic probe (the \u201cTaqMan\u2122\u201d probe) during the amplification reaction. The fluorogenic probe consists of an oligonucleotide labeled with both a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher dye. During PCR, this probe is cleaved by the 5\u2032-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase if, and only if, it hybridizes to the segment being amplified. Cleavage of the probe generates an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the reporter dye. Another method of detecting amplification products that relies on the use of energy transfer is the \u201cbeacon probe\u201d method described by Tyagi and Kramer, Nature Biotech. 14:303-309 (1996), which is also the subject of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,119,801 and 5,312,728. This method employs oligonucleotide hybridization probes that can form hairpin structures.",
                        "Various other techniques for performing quantitative amplification of nucleic acids are also known. For example, some methodologies employ one or more probe oligonucleotides that are structured such that a change in fluorescence is generated when the oligonucleotide(s) is hybridized to a target nucleic acid. For example, one such method involves is a dual fluorophore approach that exploits fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), e.g., LightCycler\u2122 hybridization probes, where two oligo probes anneal to the amplicon. The oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize in a head-to-tail orientation with the fluorophores separated at a distance that is compatible with efficient energy transfer. Other examples of labeled oligonucleotides that are structured to emit a signal when bound to a nucleic acid or incorporated into an extension product include: Scorpions\u2122 probes (e.g., Whitcombe et al., Nature Biotechnology 17:804-807, 1999, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,145), Sunrise\u2122 (or Amplifluor\u2122) probes (e.g., Nazarenko et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:2516-2521, 1997, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,635), and probes that form a secondary structure that results in reduced signal without a quencher and that emits increased signal when hybridized to a target (e.g., Lux Probes\u2122)\u25a1.",
                        "In other embodiments, intercalating agents that produce a signal when intercalated in double stranded DNA may be used. Exemplary agents include SYBR GREEN\u2122 and SYBR GOLD\u2122. Since these agents are not template-specific, it is assumed that the signal is generated based on template-specific amplification. This can be confirmed by monitoring signal as a function of temperature because melting point of template sequences will generally be much higher than, for example, primer-dimers, etc.",
                        "In other embodiments, the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe, e.g., in a dot blot or Northern format. In an alternative embodiment, the probe(s) are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe(s), for example, in a gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoding the biomarkers or other proteins of interest.",

Hybridization intensities for each probe on the array are determined and converted to a quantitative value representing relative gene expression levels. See, U.S. Pat.

By the term \u201cLD\u201d it is meant to collectively refer to low dose ionizing radiation and low dose ionizing radiation-induced. Radiation-induced genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, with strong evidence that it can be induced by high dose exposures. Using a sensitive flow method for detecting chromosomal damage in white blood cells, we demonstrate that high-dose exposure induces persistent genomic instability, but only in the cancer-sensitive BALB/c mice (not in C57BL/6). In contrast, LD exposure does not induce persistent genomic instability in either strain, even though BALB/c mice are more susceptible to LD-induced cancer.",
                                "We then launched a system search for molecular mechanisms that might explain the strain differences in breast susceptibility to LD exposure using transcript profiling (Lowe X R, Bhattacharya S, Marchetti F, Wyrobek A J (2009) Early brain response to low-dose radiation exposure involves molecular networks and pathways associated with cognitive functions, advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease.

(2011) Radiation Acts on the Microenvironment to Affect Breast Carcinogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms that Decrease Cancer Latency and Affect Tumor Type. Cancer Cell 19: 640-651), since previously we found recurrent expression changes in cell lines from unrelated individuals after doses as low as 1 cGy (Wyrobek A J, Manohar C F, Krishnan V V, Nelson D O, Furtado M R, et al. (2011) Low dose radiation response curves, networks and pathways in human lymphoblastoid cells exposed from 1 to 10 cGy of acute gamma radiation. Mutat Res 722: 119-130). We investigated three exposure scenarios (FIG. 1A): (1) low dose (LD) group\u2014four weekly doses of 7.5 cGy, (2) high dose (HD) group\u2014four weekly doses of 1.8 Gy, (3) unexposed group\u2014four weekly sham exposures. We analyzed expression profiles to identify expression signatures associated with biological functions that might explain the differential LD cancer susceptibility between these strains. We then tested LD susceptibility associated signatures in other murine and human knowledgebases (TGF\u03b2-responsive, pubertal mammary development, human DCIS and breast cancer biomarkers, and disease free survival in human breast cancer patients) to understand their relevance to breast cancer (Loi S, Haibe-Kains B, Desmedt C, Lallemand F, Tutt A M, et al.

The risk estimates for radiation-induced breast cancer, lung cancer and leukemia do not vary significantly between humans and mice, supporting the mouse as a reasonable surrogate model (Storer J B, Mitchell T J, Fry R J (1988) Extrapolation of the relative risk of radiogenic neoplasms across mouse strains and to man. Radiat Res 114: 331-35). We selected two inbred strains of mice that differ in their genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced MG cancer: BALB/c as more sensitive, and C57BL/6 strain as more resistant (Storer J B, Mitchell T J, Fry R J (1988) Extrapolation of the relative risk of radiogenic neoplasms across mouse strains and to man. Radiat Res 114: 331-35). BALB/c mice carry two DNA-PKcs polymorphisms with reduced protein expression, reduced catalytic activity and defective non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) of double strand breaks (Yu Y, Okayasu R, Weil M M, Silver A, McCarthy M, et al. (2001) Elevated breast cancer risk in irradiated BALB/c mice associates with unique functional polymorphism of the Prkdc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) gene. Cancer Res 61: 1820-1824).

                                "We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in baseline expression (i.e., expression levels before radiation exposure) and in responses to LD exposures can be used to identify tissue functions that determine susceptibility to LD-induced MG cancer and tissue functions that determine individual variation for better or poorer survival among breast cancer patients. We identified several tissue functions and two transcriptional signatures that are associated with susceptibility to LD-induced cancer in mice and with poor survival in breast cancer patients. This research lays the foundation for a new systems-biology approach for identifying the mechanisms of LD radiation-induced breast cancer, and suggests a new strategy to identify genetic features that predispose/protect individuals from risk of LD radiation-induced breast cancer.",

For example, at airports, women known to be at increased risk might benefit from avoiding (declining) the use of airport security scanners. In the medical field, women at increased risk might consider alternative diagnostic imaging modalities that do not use X-rays. Women undergoing radiotherapy treatment (high targeted doses of radiation) frequently are exposed to low-doses of radiation surrounding the target area. Additional shielding might be beneficial for women sensitive to low-dose radiation. In many instances knowing where a patient is on the spectrum of radiation sensitivity allows the patient and health care professionals to make an informed decision taking risk to benefit ratio into account.",

                                "MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6 and MCM7 are genes that encode proteins that are highly conserved mini-chromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) that are involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. The hexameric protein complex formed by MCM proteins (MCM2-7) is a key component of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC) and may be involved in the formation of replication forks and in the recruitment of other DNA replication related proteins. This MCM2 protein forms a complex with MCM4, 6, and 7, and has been shown to regulate the helicase activity of the complex, and may act as a DNA unwinding enzyme. The phosphorylation of the complex by CDC2 kinase reduces the helicase activity, suggesting a role in the regulation of DNA replication. MCM2 is phosphorylated, and thus regulated by, protein kinases CDC2 and CDC7. MCM3 has been shown to interact directly with MCM5/CDC46 and interacts with and is acetylated by MCM3AP, a chromatin-associated acetyltransferase. The acetylation of MCM3 inhibits the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression. The phosphorylation of this MCM4 protein by CDC2 kinase reduces the DNA helicase activity and chromatin binding of the MCM complex. MCM4 is mapped to a region on the chromosome 8 head-to-head next to the PRKDC/DNA-PK, a DNA-activated protein kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The MCM5 protein is structurally very similar to the CDC46 protein from S. cerevisiae, a protein involved in the initiation of DNA replication. The MCM5 protein can interact with at least two other members of this family. MCM5 protein is upregulated in the transition from the G0 to G1/S phase of the cell cycle and may actively participate in cell cycle regulation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the intron regions of MCM6 gene are associated with differential transcriptional activation of the promoter of the neighboring lactase gene and, thereby, influence lactose intolerance in early adulthood. Cyclin D1-dependent kinase, CDK4, is found to associate with MCM7 protein, and may regulate the binding of this protein with the tumorsuppressor protein RB1/RB.",

This provided four categories of genes as listed below. Each category of genes includes a full list of genes and a statistically shortened list (signature) that can be used to develop a single value estimate for each category of risk for each woman. The single value for each woman is computed by adding the expression values for the component genes within her tumor tissue.

                                "We used a highly sensitive flow-cytometric assay to assess the frequency of micronucleated red cells as a measure of genome instability in unirradiated young adult female mice (Dertinger S D, Torous D K, Tometsko K R (1997) Flow cytometric analysis of micronucleated reticulocytes in mouse bone marrow. Mutat Res 390: 257-262). FIG. 1B shows that the frequencies of immature reticulocytes (MN-RET) and mature normochromatic erythrocytes (MN-NCE) carrying micronuclei were \u02dc36% and \u02dc57% higher in the radiation-sensitive BALB/c strain than in the more radiation-resistant C57BL/6 strain [14] (p<0.0001; Table 4). These differences are at the high end of baseline variation among mouse strains (Bhilwade H N, Chaubey R C, Chauhan P S (2004) Gamma ray induced bone marrow micronucleated erythrocytes in seven strains of mouse. Mutat Res 560: 19-26), and are consistent with the significant associations that have been reported between blood micronuclei frequencies and cancer risks in human studies (Bonassi S, Znaor A, Ceppi M, Lando C, Chang W P, et al. (2007) An increased micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes predicts the risk of cancer in humans. Carcinogenesis 28: 625-631).",
                                "We also compared the transcript profiles for nucleated cells from the peripheral blood and mammary glands (after excising the inguinal lymph nodes) from BALB/c and C57BL/6 female mice to identify common variations in gene expression and their associated tissue functions. FIG. 2A shows that the BALB/c to C57BL/6 transcript ratios for the 131 genes comprising the \u201csystemic baseline signature\u201d are strongly correlated in blood and mammary gland cells (r2=0.83, FIG. 2A). FIG. 2B shows that the systemic baseline signature is significantly enriched for genes involved in stress response and RNA processing and includes DNA repair-associated genes. BALB/c tissues showed lower transcript levels than C57BL/5 for the DNA repair genes PARP3 and RAD23A (not reported previously), and higher transcript levels for MSH5 and SMC6. The PARP3, MSH5, and SMC6 expression findings were confirmed by qPCR (Table 8). LD did not induce or contribute to genomic instability in either strain. We measured the frequencies of micronucleated red blood cells after whole-body LD and HD exposures in sensitive BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 female mice at the three times indicated in FIG. 1A. The LD exposures induced small transient increases in MN-NCE in both strains at the two early sampling times (p<0.02), but neither strain showed evidence of radiation-induced genomic instability at 1 month after exposure (FIG. 1C). The HD reference exposures (FIGS. 1B and 1C) increased in the frequencies of MN-RET and MN-NCE at the early sampling times in both strains (p<0.0001, Tables 5 and 6). Interestingly, the radiation-sensitive BALB/c showed significant radiation-induced genomic instability at 1 month after HD exposure while the radiation-resistant C57BL/6 mice showed no evidence of this (p<0.0001; FIG. 1B, Tables 5 and 6). We confirmed these finding in a separate study of mice treated with a combined LD/HD regimen where each 7.5 cGy dose was followed 6 hr later by a 1.8 Gy dose (5-6). The BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice that received the combined LD/HD regimen were indistinguishable from the animals that received HD alone, confirming that the LD regimen did not induce or contribute to genomic instability in either strain.",
                                "These findings led to the hypothesis that the increased MG cancer risks in BALB/c mice after LD radiation are more likely to be associated with genetically driven differences in oncogenic barriers in their tissues. This motivated our comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in the BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains to identify mammary tissue functions that might explain the differences in LD-induced mammary cancer rates.",

                                "Analysis of transcription profiles in MG tissues from BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains at 4 hrs (i.e., for the early response) and 1 month after LD exposure (FIG. 1A) revealed response functions unique for each strain that were not induced by HD exposures. FIG. 3 shows that there were \u02dc4\u00d7 more modulated genes in BALB/c tissue than in C57BL/6 at 4 hours after LD exposure. The differentially expressed gene sets were computationally mapped to curated functions (FIG. 10A), canonical pathways (FIG. 4A), and networks (FIG. 4B, 11). These analyses suggested that early LD responses of BALB/c mice involved down-regulation of immune, epithelial, and microenvironment functions (14 canonical pathways, 0.002<p<0.02), which were not affected by LD in C57BL/6 nor by HD exposure in either strain (FIG. 4A, and Table 7 for an inclusive listing). LD exposure in BALB/c but not C57BL/6 also altered expression in networks consistent with increased HIF1A stress response (FIG. 4B), decreased immune and endothelial function (FIG. 4A), and altered MG developmental- and TGF\u03b2-regulation (Table 1).",
                                "The LD induced HIF1A transcription factor network has been associated with cellular responses to genotoxic stress and low 02, (FIG. 4B). L2L analyses (Washington University L2L website) identified 11 genes upregulated in LD-exposed BALB/c mice that were also upregulated under hypoxic conditions in renal epithelial and carcinoma cell systems (4.3e-05<p<9.0e-03) (Harris A L (2002) Hypoxia\u2014a key regulatory factor in tumour growth.

The HIF1A, STC2 and RAB20 responses were confirmed by qPCR (Table 8).",
                                "The LD induced immune system network in BALB/c (FIG. 4A, 11; Table 7) was associated with lymphocyte activation, and expression of cytokines, chemokines, and macrophage markers. The early BALB/c responses of selected genes in this network (IRF8, IL7R and TREM2) were confirmed by qPCR (Table 8). The early BALB/c specific LD transcriptional response also was associated with down-regulation of coagulation and leukocyte extravasation signaling (FIG. 4A). These functions are an essential part of the inflammatory reaction. Down-regulation of the macrophage-specific marker EMR1 (F4/80) and macrophage-associated proteins (TREM2 and GPNMB) suggested that LD-exposure led to a reduction in macrophages in BALB/c. This prediction was tested and confirmed by IHC in tissue sections of sham and low-dose irradiated BALB/c mice (FIG. 4C; p=0.01).",
                                "The early BALB/c specific LD induced transcriptional response signature included \u02dc90 MG development genes (Table 1). These genes are typically expressed at 3-7 weeks of age during puberty and not at 12 weeks (the age of the irradiated mice). These genes normally are involved in terminal end-bud development (e.g. GATA3, RUNX1, MSX2 and STAT5a), differentiation and ductal branching and morphogenesis. L2L analyses also showed that the set of LD upregulated genes in BALB/c genes were highly associated the developing MG of pubertal mice in other studies (p=5.14e-30) (McBryan J, Howlin J, Kenny P A, Shioda T, Martin F (2007) ERalpha-CITED1 co-regulated genes expressed during pubertal mammary gland development: implications for breast cancer prognosis. Oncogene 26: 6406-6419). CD24, KRT19, WNT4, AREG and IDO1 responses in BALB/c mice were confirmed by qPCR (Table 8). Importantly, \u02dc50% of these early BALB/c LD response genes (144/313) were TGF\u03b2 responsive (Table 1; Website actin.ucd.ie/tgfbeta/, Chen X L, Kapoun A M (2009) Heterogeneous activation of the TGFbeta pathway in glioblastomas identified by gene expression-based classification using TGFbeta-responsive genes. J Transl Med 7: 12). Extracellular TGF\u03b2 activation occurs in response to the generation of ROS (Barcellos-Hoff M H, Dix T A (1996) Redox-mediated activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta 1. Mol Endocrinol 10: 1077-1083) and regulates broad epithelial and stromal radiation damage response functions of the BALB/c LD genes. The differential activation of TGF\u03b2 responsive \u25a1genes that were activated in BALB/c were not activated in C57BL/6 mice, indicating that there is a major genetic difference in TGF\u03b2 response to LD radiation in the MGs in these two strains. This is consistent with the increasing evidence of the regulatory role of the TGF\u03b2 response in radiation carcinogenesis of the mammary gland (Nguyen D H, Oketch-Rabah H A, Illa-Bochaca I, Geyer F C, Reis-Filho J S, et al. (2011) Radiation Acts on the Microenvironment to Affect Breast Carcinogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms that Decrease Cancer Latency and Affect Tumor Type. Cancer Cell 19: 640-651).",

                                "We saw a dramatic transition in the transcript profiles between the early and 1-month responses in MG tissues in radiation-sensitive BALB/c and radiation-resistant C57BL/6 strains of mice. While, similar numbers of genes were modulated in these two strains 1 month after LD exposures (FIG. 3, Table 7), only a few functions significantly modulated at 4 hours in BALB/c remained so 1 month after LD exposure (FIG. 5A, 10). One month after exposure, 5 canonical pathways were uniquely associated with C57BL/6 and a different 11 pathways were unique to BALB/c (FIG. 5A). BALB/c mice acquired an enhanced proliferation phenotype (referenced to sham) while C57BL/6 acquired a diminished proliferation phenotype, consistent with senescence (FIG. 5; 12). The BALB/c 1-month LD response showed upregulation of a MYC-centric network consisting of cell cycle genes (FIG. 5B) plus a subnetwork associated with minichromosome maintenance, (FIG. 12A). In contrast, the 1-month response of C57BL/6 mice showed a highly saturated protein interaction network with the network node, CDKN1A, a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, (FIG. 5B) and with down-regulation of many genes associated with DNA replication, cell-cycle progression and development. L2L analyses of the genes in the C57BL/6-specific senescence signature identified significant associations with expression signatures of cell cycle arrest and senescence (1.13E-11<p<1.15E-04; Chang H Y, Sneddon J B, Alizadeh A A, Sood R, West R B, et al. (2004) Gene expression signature of fibroblast serum response predicts human cancer progression: similarities between tumors and wounds.

J Biol Chem 277: 36329-36337) including downregulation of SOX9, SKP2, CCNA2 and CDKN1A (confirmed by qPCR; Table 8 and FIG. 5B). SOX9 is a mark for adult human progenitor cells, mediates deposition of ECM component and is a major transcriptional regulator of mitotic activity in breast cancer (Hanley K P, Oakley F, Sugden S, Wilson D I, Mann D A, et al. (2008) Ectopic SOX9 mediates extracellular matrix deposition characteristic of organ fibrosis. J Biol Chem 283: 14063-14071; Furuyama K, Kawaguchi Y, Akiyama H, Horiguchi M, Kodama S, et al. Continuous cell supply from a Sox9-expressing progenitor zone in adult liver, exocrine pancreas and intestine. Nat Genet 43: 34-41). Consistent with its role in the control of expression of ECM, we observed down-regulation of genes associated with ECM remodeling and epithelial differentiation (not seen in BALB/c mice) suggesting a reduced turn-over of the ECM in C57BL/6 mice (FIG. 12B). FIG. 6 shows that expression of SOX9 protein in the MG was limited to the nuclei of luminal and myoepithelial cells and that the fraction of SOX9-positive cells was significantly reduced after LD exposure in C57BL/6 mice (p<0.0001), consistent with reduced mitotic activity in MG of C57BL/6 mice at 1 month after LD.",

                                "We began by testing the hypothesis that expression levels of the 131 genes that are differentially expressed between non-irradiated BALB/c and C57BL6 mice in blood and MG tissues are associated with breast cancer outcomes. We tested the association of transcript levels for the 94 human orthologs that we were able to associate with the mouse baseline signature with outcome in 156 breast cancer patients for which information on disease-free survival was available (Pawitan Y, Bjohle J, Amler L, Borg A L, Egyhazi S, et al. (2005) Gene expression profiling spares early breast cancer patients from adjuvant therapy: derived and validated in two population-based cohorts. Breast Cancer Res 7: R953-964) We accomplished this by calculating for each patient, the sum of the normalized expression intensities of the human orthologs. As shown in FIG. 7A, patients with above-median expression had significantly reduced survival duration compared to patients with below-median expression (p<8.16 E-05) and had significantly worse prognosis (FIG. 7B; p<0.0001) (Loi S, Haibe-Kains B, Desmedt C, Lallemand F, Tutt A M, et al. (2007) Definition of clinically distinct molecular subtypes in estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas through genomic grade. J Clin Oncol 25: 1239-1246; Pawitan Y, Bjohle J, Amler L, Borg A L, Egyhazi S, et al. (2005) Gene expression profiling spares early breast cancer patients from adjuvant therapy: derived and validated in two population-based cohorts. Breast Cancer Res 7: R953-964). Interestingly, murine genes that showed significant strain differences only in MG or only in blood cells did not show significant associations with cancer survival, underscoring the importance of selecting genes that show \u201csystemic differences\u201d across tissues. As a negative control, expression levels of a set of 131 mouse genes that showed the \u201cleast\u201d differential expression in both MG and blood between the two strains were not significantly associated with breast cancer survival (p=0.4). Among the 94 human orthologs in the murine baseline signature, we identified 55 cancer outcome associated (COA) genes (Table 2) that individually showed differential expression between the above-median and below-median patient groups (5.3E-12<p<8.4E-03). This set of COA genes was enriched for stress response (11 genes) and RNA processing (9 genes) (FIG. 2B and Table 2). Interestingly, this COA gene set contained a small number of genes (n=9), which showed a significant association with breast cancer survival when expressed at lower levels in the above-median patient group. Among these are a number of previously proposed tumor suppressor genes: RUNX1, CBX7, PRDX2 and PRDX3. Concordant with this human finding, all four genes were also expressed at lower levels in BALB/c compared to C57BL/6 in the systemic baseline signature. This subset of 9 COA genes was significantly associated with disease free survival when down-regulated in the cancer patients (p=5.5E-04). The signature of the remaining 46 genes was associated with disease-free survival when expressed at higher levels (55 minus 9=46 genes) showed a similar association with disease-free survival as compared with the full systemic baseline signature of 94 genes (p=6.8 E-03 vs 8.16E-05)."

                                "We then tested the hypothesis that the 1-month BALB/c signature (i.e., the genes that are significantly upregulated at 1 month after LD exposure in relation to sham) was associated with disease-free survival among breast cancer patients. We selected the full and unbiased set of 105 BALB/c genes with significantly increased expression at 1 month after LD exposure. We examined the association of this signature with disease-free survival in breast cancer patients using two human knowledgebases that contain tumor expression profiles obtained at surgery linked to patient survival (Loi S, et al. (2007) J Clin Oncol 25: 1239-124; Pawitan Y, et al. (2005) Breast Cancer Res 7: R953-964). Similar to our analyses of the baseline signature, we summed the expression intensities of all corresponding human orthologs (n=96) from tumor samples and divided the patients into two groups by the median. The patients with \u201cabove median\u201d expression values experienced higher rates of breast-cancer related deaths than \u201cbelow median\u201d patients, (FIG. 7A, p<0.0001) and had significantly worse prognosis (FIG. 7B; p=<0.0021). As a negative control, we selected 105 of the 1-month BALB/c genes with the \u201cleast\u201d differential expression between irradiated and sham mice, and showed that the corresponding set of human orthologs was not significantly associated with breast cancer survival (p=0.2). Among the 96 human orthologs of the 1-month BALB/c signature, we identified 36 additional COA genes (Table 2) that individually showed differential expression between the above-median and below-median patient groups (5.4E-14<p<9.2E-03). Of these, 25 were related to mitosis, many of which have individually been associated with breast cancer survival in prior studies. Six of the 11 non-mitosis related genes were previously associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients: KRT17, MMP12, SLC7A5, SQLE, GABRP and PA2G4 (See Furuya M, Horiguchi J, Nakajima H, Kanai Y, Oyama T Correlation of L-type amino acid transporter 1 and CD98 expression with triple negative breast cancer prognosis.

The association between the 11 non-mitosis genes and breast-cancer-related death was comparable to using the full set of 96 human orthologs or the refined set of 36 mitosis genes suggesting strong involvement of both mitosis and non-mitosis radiation responses in defining the poor prognosis for breast cancer patients.",
                                "We then addressed the hypothesis that the direction of expression changes in the resistant and sensitive strains at 1-month after LD exposures are concordant with the differences in gene expression of human DCIS and invasive breast cancer, and poor prognosis. (Concordance is defined as up-regulated in BALB/c, no change or down-regulated in C57BL/6 and up in human DCIS or human breast cancer; or vice versa). The BALB/c 1 month COA genes that were associated with poor prognosis when upregulated were enriched for mitosis associated genes (Table 2), whereas in C57BL/6 many of the same genes were down-regulated. As a further test of the importance of concordance in direction of expression, we compared the full set of genes modulated at 1-month after LD exposure in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice against a meta-gene signature of 946 human breast cancer biomarkers (Abba M C, Lacunza E, Butti M, Aldaz C M (2010) Breast cancer biomarker discovery in the functional genomic age: a systematic review of 42 gene expression signatures. Biomark Insights 5: 103-118), and the direction of expression for overlapping genes was compared against expression in human DCIS and breast cancer (Cheng A S, Culhane A C, Chan M W, Venkataramu C R, Ehrich M, et al. (2008) Epithelial progeny of estrogen-exposed breast progenitor cells display a cancer-like methylome. Cancer Res 68: 1786-1796; Emery L A, Tripathi A, King C, Kavanah M, Mendez J, et al.

(2008) A precisely regulated gene expression cassette potently modulates metastasis and survival in multiple solid cancers. PLoS Genet 4: e1000129). This analyses (FIG. 8A) identified 45 concordant genes (34 mitosis and 11 stromal genes) with opposing responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 where the direction of the BALB/c response matched the direction of response in independent studies of human breast cancers. Furthermore, a subset of 19 genes (FIG. 8A) showed concordant responses between the mouse strains and human DCIS.",
                                "Lastly, we tested the association between the 1-month LD BALB/c signature and poor prognosis for human breast cancer (Hu et al, in preparation). FIG. 8B shows strong concordance in the direction of LD-induced expression in mammary tissue in the resistant and sensitive strains of mice and the direction of expression in patients with poor prognosis (FIG. 8B). Hu and colleagues reported that human poor prognosis signature is under transcriptional control of SOX9, which we demonstrated to be down-regulated at both the transcript level and protein level in the resistant C57BL/6 strain (FIGS. 5B and 6).",
                                "We employed in vivo systems analyses to identify genetic differences in baseline (i.e., before radiation exposure) and LD-induced mammary gland gene expression in radiation-sensitive and resistant strains of mice that are at the far ends of the mammary cancer sensitivity spectrum (Ullrich R L, Jernigan M C, Satterfield L C, Bowles N D (1987) Radiation carcinogenesis: time-dose relationships. Radiat Res 111: 179-184), and then used in situ protein validation and multi-species bioinformatic resources to identify distinct tissue functions and signatures associated with cancer risks and with properties of breast cancer behavior in humans. Strain variations in baseline and LD-response expression signatures were associated with differential susceptibility to LD-induced mammary cancer in mice and with inter-individual variations in human breast cancer survival. Our findings support the hypothesis that mechanisms that control susceptibility to low-dose radiation induced mammary cancer in mice are similar to those that determine poor-survival in breast cancer patients. In mice, differential baseline expression of tumor suppressor genes and genes associated with stress response and RNA processing, reduced immune activity early after LD exposure and differential expression of proliferation associated genes at 1 month after LD exposure were strongly associated with higher sensitivity to LD-induced mammary tumors in mice. The strong association of baseline and 1-month signatures with disease-free survival in human breast cancer patients points to tissue mechanisms of individual variation to LD-induced mammary cancer, and provide compelling evidence for non-linear dose responses after LD exposures.",
                                "Genomic instability is a critical step in the genesis of cancers after high dose exposures (Ullrich R L, Ponnaiya B (1998) Radiation-induced instability and its relation to radiation carcinogenesis. Int J Radiat Biol 74: 747-754; Selvanayagam C S, Davis C M, Cornforth M N, Ullrich R L (1995) Latent expression of p53 mutations and radiation-induced mammary cancer. Cancer Res 55: 3310-3317), and we like others observed that BALB/c was more sensitive to HD-induced genomic instability than C57B1/6 (Ponnaiya B, Cornforth M N, Ullrich R L (1997) Radiation-induced chromosomal instability in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: the difference is as clear as black and white. Radiat Res 147: 121-125). Surprisingly, we found no evidence for genomic instability after LD exposures in BALB/c despite its sensitivity to LD-induced mammary cancer, which led us to search for genetic variation in molecular barrier functions that may control susceptibility to LD-induced cancer.",
                                "The genetic differences in baseline and LD expression profiles identified several unique tissue response functions associated with mammary cancer risk (FIG. 9). The baseline differences in unirradiated animals (systemic signature) were significantly enriched for stress response and RNA processing genes, and included several DNA repair genes and tumor suppressor genes (Table 2). The stunted immune response observed early after LD-irradiation in BALB/c but not C57BL/6 strains was consistent with prior findings in spleen cells of LD-irradiated BALB/c mice that also received a concanavalin A challenge (Shankar B, Premachandran S, Bharambe S D, Sundaresan P, Sainis K B (1999) Modification of immune response by low dose ionizing radiation: role of apoptosis. Immunol Lett 68: 237-245). As predicted from the microarray data, we demonstrated in tissue sections that the stunted immune response involved reduced numbers of tissue macrophages in BALB/c mice but not C57BL/6 (FIG. 4C), and there are ongoing efforts to examine differential production versus recruitment. The stunted immune response may also be related to the very high TGF\u03b2-associated expression in BALB/c (not seen in C57BL/6 mice), given that 10 cGy exposures can activate TGF\u03b2 in BALB/c (Nguyen D H, Oketch-Rabah H A, Illa-Bochaca I, Geyer F C, Reis-Filho J S, et al. (2011) Radiation Acts on the Microenvironment to Affect Breast Carcinogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms that Decrease Cancer Latency and Affect Tumor Type. Cancer Cell 19: 640-651) which in turn can lead to immune dysfunction (Gold L I (1999) The role for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in human cancer. Crit Rev Oncog 10: 303-360). The early HIF1A-associated response in BALB/c may indicate tissue hypoxia or a more generalized tissue stress response (Bristow R G, Hill R P (2008) Hypoxia and metabolism. Hypoxia, DNA repair and genetic instability. Nat Rev Cancer 8: 180-192). Among the 12 hypoxia-inducible genes in irradiated BALB/c (Harris A L (2002) Hypoxia\u2014a key regulatory factor in tumour growth. Nat Rev Cancer 2: 38-47; Leonard M O, Cottell D C, Godson C, Brady H R, Taylor C T (2003) The role of HIF-1 alpha in transcriptional regulation of the proximal tubular epithelial cell response to hypoxia. J Biol Chem 278: 40296-40304; Jiang Y, Zhang W, Kondo K, Klco J M, St Martin T B, et al. (2003) Gene expression profiling in a renal cell carcinoma cell line: dissecting VHL and hypoxia-dependent pathways. Mol Cancer Res 1: 453-462), both HIF1\u03b1 and STC2, a HIF1A target gene, were overexpressed in human cancers and pre-neoplastic breast lesions (Bonin F, Molina M, Malet C, Ginestet C, Berthier-Vergnes 0, et al. (2009) GATA3 is a master regulator of the transcriptional response to low-dose ionizing radiation in human keratinocytes. BMC Genomics 10: 417). The early expression of the transcriptional activators and repressors (i.e., STAT5a, GATA3, RUNX1 and MSX2) may be the reason for the inappropriate expression of the \u201cpubertal-like\u201d mammary development genes in BALB/c mice, which in their TGF\u03b2-modified microenvironment may be associated with the increased cancer risk observed in that strain. In studies with human keratinocytes, the promoter regions of genes modulated by LD radiation of were enriched for GATA3 binding sites, which supports the hypothesis that GATA3 plays an important role in the LD transcriptional response in BALB/c but not C57BL/6 (Bonin F, Molina M, Malet C, Ginestet C, Berthier-Vergnes 0, et al. (2009) GATA3 is a master regulator of the transcriptional response to low-dose ionizing radiation in human keratinocytes. BMC Genomics 10: 417). Finally, our model predicts that at 1-month after LD exposures, the MG tissue of the resistant C57BL/6 mice appears to mount a barrier against cell progression and ECM remodeling, similar to a senescence-like phenotype, which may block the division of residual damaged cells, thereby acting like a global tumor repressor (Rodier F, Campisi J Four faces of cellular senescence. J Cell Biol 192: 547-556). In support of this prediction, we demonstrated that the frequencies of SOX9-protein-positive epithelial cells were reduced in mammary tissue of C57BL/6 (but not in BALB/c) at 1 month after LD exposures. Further research will investigate how these unique baseline and tissue response functions interact at the tissue level to control breast cancer susceptibility.",
                                "Comparative systems analyses of the expression profiles in unirradiated mice and human breast cancer outcomes identified 55 genes, each significantly associated with patient survival. In the majority of genes, poor survival was associated with increased expression. Unexpectedly, 9 genes showed the inverse association, including the tumor suppressor genes: RUNX1, CBX7, PRDX2 and PRDX3. These genes were expressed at lower levels both in the blood and MG tissues of unirradiated BALB/c compared to C57BL/6 suggesting that increased cancer sensitivity could be associated with less effective tumor suppressor mechanisms in BALB/c. CBX7 is a known tumor suppressor in both mice and humans and several PRDXs have been shown to have tumor preventive functions (Agrawal-Singh S, Isken F, Agelopoulos K, Klein H U, Thoennissen N H, et al. (2011) Genome wide analysis of histone H3 acetylation patterns in AML identifies PRDX2 as an epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene. Blood; Forzati (2012) CBX7 is a tumor suppressor in mice and humans. J Clin Invest; Neumann C A, Fang Q (2007) Are peroxiredoxins tumor suppressors? Curr Opin Pharmacol 7: 375-380). RUNX1 was special in our study, in that it was further down-regulated in BALB/c at 1 month after LD exposure. RUNX1 is a classic tumor suppressor gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and loss of RUNX1 causes hyperproliferation and abnormal morphogenesis in a 3D model of breast epithelial cells (Silva F P, Morolli B, Storlazzi C T, Anelli L, Wessels H, et al. (2003) Identification of RUNX1/AML1 as a classical tumor suppressor gene. Oncogene 22: 538-54; Wang L, Brugge J S, Janes K A Intersection of FOXO- and RUNX1-mediated gene expression programs in single breast epithelial cells during morphogenesis and tumor progression. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108: E803-812). The differential baseline expression of tumor suppressor genes, multiple DNA repair and stress response genes in normal blood and mammary tissue of unirradiated BALB/c mice raises the intriguing hypothesis that the collective influence of multiple systemic functions predisposes BALB/c mice mammary carcinogenesis after subsequent LD exposures.",
                                "Comparative systems analyses of expression profiles at 1-month after LD exposure in mice and human breast cancer outcomes identified 36 genes that were each associated with patient disease free survival in cancer patients when they were upregulated. This signature includes mitosis-associated genes (Table 2), consistent with the observation that human cancer signatures include proliferation genes and that increased proliferation status of tumors is strongly associated with poor survival (Whitfield M L, George L K, Grant G D, Perou C M (2006) Common markers of proliferation. Nat Rev Cancer 6: 99-106) The statistical association between the 11 non-mitosis genes and breast-cancer-related death was comparable to using the 36 mitosis genes suggesting strong involvement of both mitosis and non-mitosis radiation responses in the 36 gene signature. Five of the 11 non-mitosis genes had not been previously associated with breast cancer survival. We observed minimal overlap between our signatures and the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 gene signature that defines the molecular breast cancer subtypes (SQLE and KRT17) and the 70-gene poor prognosis signature (MCM6) (Sorlie T, Perou C M, Tibshirani R, Aas T, Geisler S, et al. (2001) Gene expression patterns of breast carcinomas distinguish tumor subclasses with clinical implications. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 10869-10874; van 't Veer L J, Dai H, van de Vijver M J, He Y D, Hart A A, et al. (2002) Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer. Nature 415: 530-536), suggesting that our LD radiation-response signatures are different from those developed independently of radiation exposures and provide new information related to breast cancer risks from LD radiation exposures.",
                                "Our studies provide strong evidence for dose non-linearities in expression and tissue functions after LD exposures, and strong evidence against the validity of the LNT for molecular responses. The LNT model uses linear extrapolations of cancer risk from high to LD exposures, with the assumption that underlying mechanisms are also linear. Our study provides overwhelming evidence for dose non-linearities in gene expression (FIG. 3), tissue functions (FIG. 10) and canonical pathways (FIG. 4; Table 7). We also found a number of genes showing plateau-like responses with dose. As shown in FIG. 13, 76 BALB/c genes were modulated in the same direction and at similar magnitudes after low-versus high-dose exposures, in striking contrast to the 24-fold difference in doses. We also found opposing directions for low-versus high-dose responses (FIG. 13B). But most surprising in regards to non-linearity was our finding of strain differences in low-dose thresholds of induction, with the sensitive BALB/c strain showing lower thresholds. Table 3 lists genes similarly modulated at high dose in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 but that differed dramatically in their low-dose responses. While the BALB/c low dose responses were generally lower compared to their high-dose responses, none of these genes were induced after low dose in C57BL/6. Interestingly, the magnitude of the C57BL/6 high-dose responses were significantly different from the BALB/c high-dose responses (p=0.003), but were not different from the BALB/c low-dose responses (p=0.7). Taken together our findings provide strong evidence that the high dose response is not an enhancement of the low-dose response, rather it is remarkably different and strongly argues, at least at the gene expression level, against using the LNT model for low-dose risk predictions.",
                                "The fractionated low-dose exposure regimen used in our study is relevant to various human LD radiation exposure scenarios. The maximum yearly allowable dose for radiation workers in the recent nuclear crisis at a Japanese nuclear power plant is 100-250 mSv, which is similar to the whole body fractionated dosing used in our study (4\u00d775=300 mSv). Also, multiple abdominal CT scans can yield doses of \u02dc60 mGy and full body CT scans can involve doses of \u02dc100 mGy, similar to the individual doses in our study. Also, the penumbra of radiotherapy fields for breast cancer can deliver doses to the contralateral breast similar to the doses in our study (Boice J D, Jr., Harvey E B, Blettner M, Stovall M, Flannery J T (1992) Cancer in the contralateral breast after radiotherapy for breast cancer. N Engl J Med 326: 781-785).",
                                "On the assumption that there is substantial genetic variation in molecular tissue responses and mammary cancer risks in human women exposed to LD ionizing radiation, as observed in mice, our findings provide a novel approach for developing predictive tools to identify individual with higher or lower cancer risks from LD exposures, and for distinguishing breast cancers induced by LD radiation versus other causes. Our work also points to a re-examination of the assumptions associated with biological processes controlling transduction of low-dose radiation into breast cancer risk and suggest a new strategy to identify genetic and molecular features that predispose or protect individuals from LD-induced breast cancer."

                                "We identified four groups of genes in tumor tissue whose expression was significantly associated with DFS across the 5 independent knowledgebases: (1) \u02dc180 risky genes for DFS were modified to non-significance after adjustment for proliferation status using the meta-PCNA index (RISKY-AFF); (2) \u02dc50 risky genes were unaffected by the proliferation adjustment (RISKY-UNAFF); (3) \u02dc100 protective genes were affected to non-significance after proliferation adjustment (PROTECTIVE-AFF); and (4) \u02dc40 protective genes were unaffected by adjustment (PROTECTIVE-UNAFF). Step-wise Cox regressions identified smaller signatures of \u02dc10 genes per group that retained the statistical significance of the group. Using bioinformatic tools, the genes of the RISKY-AFF group are strongly associated with cancer signaling and replication functions, as expected. The RISKY-UNAFF group includes genes associated with connective tissue disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. The PROTECTIVE-AFF group includes tumor suppressors and genes that control cell movement and various breast stromal functions. The PROTECTIVE-UNAFF group involves death receptor, apoptosis and immune functions.",
                                "The criteria for selecting risky and protective genes for disease-free survival (DSF) was: (a) Genes of which DSF was significantly associated with RISK in at least 3 databases before PCNA adjustment. Risky-affected: adjustment reduced that number by at least 3. Risky-unaffected: adjustment changed the significance in 0 or 1 database. (b) Genes of which DSF was significantly associated with PROTECTION in at last 3 databases before PCNA adjustment. Protective-affected: adjustment reduced that number by at least 3. Protective-unaffected: adjustment changed the significance in 0 or 1 database.",
                                "We identified Risky and Protective genes using gene-specific (univariate) Hazard Ration (HR) from Time-to-Event Cox Proportional Hazard regression as shown in FIG. 16.",
                                "Our strategy identified four categories of RISKY and PROTECTIVE genes for DFS as shown in Table 10. A Meta-PCNA Index was applied to discriminate genes that were associated with proliferation versus those that were not. We profiled microarrays of 36 tissues from normal, healthy individuals. A Meta-PCNA Index is a signature composed of the 1% genes that most positively correlated with PCNA expression across these tissues (131 genes). See the methods described by Venet D. et al. Most random gene expression signatures are significantly associated with breast cancer outcome, PLoS Comput Biol. 2011 October; 7(10):e1002240. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002240.

                                "Data Integration as handled as the following: (1) Merge subjects from 5 GEO breast cancer survival datasets (result n=1174). (2) Transform time into units of month; (3) Within each data set prior to merging, for each gene (probe set), apply van Der Waerden transform on all expression values (result: standard normal, mean zero, variance unity); (4) Run stepwise Cox PH regression on filtered genes (183 lower limit, 39 upper limit) using n=1174 subjects.",
                                "Kaplan-Meier analyses of risk stratification of the four signatures was carried out as follows: The expression distributions of each component gene of the individual signatures were normalized across all women from all databases. For each signature, the expression of the component genes were added for each woman. The distribution of sums for each signature was split across the median value yielding two groups. K-M analyses was performed on each group using time to event.",
                                "It was found that total expression levels of the risky genes (Categories 1 and 2) measured above the median expression level of all the women across all the databases, indicated that a patient had shorter disease-free survival. If total risky genes expression is low, then that indicated that the patient had longer disease-free survival.",
                                "Conversely it was found that total expression levels of the protective genes (Categories 3 and 4) measured above the median expression level of all the women across all the databases, indicated that a patient had longer disease-free survival, i.e., these protective genes were protective. Likewise, if the total protective genes expression is low, then that indicated that the patient had shorter disease-free survival.",
                                "Our work is continuing to investigate other signatures for their ability to stratify variation in risk for patients within specific major breast tumor subtypes and to better understand the proliferation-independent tissue mechanisms that enhance DFS within each tumor subtype. We are also incorporating human-mouse comparative studies to identify mammary stromal and microenvironmental mechanisms that predict variation in risks for spontaneous breast cancer and sensitivity to low-dose ionizing radiation.",
