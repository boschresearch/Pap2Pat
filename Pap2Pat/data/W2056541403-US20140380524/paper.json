    "title": "Transgenic Tobacco Overexpressing Brassica juncea HMG-CoA Synthase 1 Shows Increased Plant Growth, Pod Size and Seed Yield",
    "date": "2014-05-21",
    "abstract": "Seeds are very important not only in the life cycle of the plant but they represent food sources for man and animals. We report herein a mutant of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HMGS), the second enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway that can improve seed yield when overexpressed in a phylogenetically distant species. In Brassica juncea, the characterisation of four isogenes encoding HMGS has been previously reported. Enzyme kinetics on recombinant wild-type (wt) and mutant BjHMGS1 had revealed that S359A displayed a 10-fold higher enzyme activity. The overexpression of wt and mutant (S359A) BjHMGS1 in Arabidopsis had up-regulated several genes in sterol biosynthesis, increasing sterol content. To quickly assess the effects of BjHMGS1 overexpression in a phylogenetically more distant species beyond the Brassicaceae, wt and mutant (S359A) BjHMGS1 were expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi) of the family Solanaceae. New observations on tobacco OEs not previously reported for Arabidopsis OEs included: (i) phenotypic changes in enhanced plant growth, pod size and seed yield (more significant in OE-S359A than OE-wtBjHMGS1) in comparison to vector-transformed tobacco, (ii) higher NtSQS expression and sterol content in OE-S359A than OE-wtBjHMGS1 corresponding to greater increase in growth and seed yield, and (iii) induction of NtIPPI2 and NtGGPPS2 and downregulation of NtIPPI1, NtGGPPS1, NtGGPPS3 and NtGGPPS4. Resembling Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs, tobacco HMGS-OEs displayed an enhanced expression of NtHMGR1, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-1, NtSMT2-2 and NtCYP85A1. Overall, increased growth, pod size and seed yield in tobacco HMGS-OEs were attributed to the up-regulation of native NtHMGR1, NtIPPI2, NtSQS, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-1, NtSMT2-2 and NtCYP85A1. Hence, S359A has potential in agriculture not only in improving phytosterol content but also seed yield, which may be desirable in food crops. This work further demonstrates HMGS function in plant reproduction that is reminiscent to reduced fertility of hmgs RNAi lines in let-7 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans.",

                "Isoprenoids form a large and diverse group of natural products, which have promising pharmacological applications including anti-cancer, antibacterial and anti-malarial properties [1]\u2013[4]. Some isoprenoids including gibberellic acids, abscisic acid, cytokinins, sterols and brassinosteroids (BRs) play significant roles in plant growth and development [4]\u2013[6]. Furthermore, carotenoids and chlorophylls are involved in photosynthesis [7]. Phytosterols are important in regulating growth and mediating stress tolerance in plants [4], [8] and their nutritional value and health benefits in the human diet has been recognized [9]\u2013[11].",
                "In higher plants, two pathways generate isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which constitutes the universal precursor of all isoprenoids: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol, and the non-MVA, methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids [1], [3], [12](and references cited therein), with some crosstalk between them [13], [14] (Figure 1). Sterols and BRs are synthesized in the cytoplasm and thereby derive from MVA, while gibberellic acids and abscisic acid precursors, active cytokinins, carotenoids and chlorophylls are produced in plastids [1], [15]\u2013[21] and thus depend on the MEP pathway (Figure 1).",
                "In agriculture, it is desirable to increase seed yield because grains represent significant sources of food, and the relevant key genes must be identified. Plant isoprenoids including sterols and BRs are essential in plant growth and reproduction [6], [22]\u2013[24] and genes from the BR-specific biosynthetic pathway, including DWF4 and DWF5, affect seed production [22]\u2013[24]. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing DWF4 showed better vegetative growth and seed yield [23], while the Arabidopsis dwf5 mutant demonstrated a dwarf phenotype accompanied by abnormal seeds [22]. The genes in the first and third steps of the MVA pathway also affect plant growth and development. RNAi lines of Arabidopsis downregulated for cytoplasmic ACETOACETYL-COA THIOLASE2 (AACT2) displayed reduction in apical dominance, seed yield and root length, accompanied by sterility and dwarfing [25]. Also, the Arabidopsis hmgr1 mutant is dwarf-like and male sterile, and has a lower sterol content [26].",
                "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HMGS) is the second enzyme in the MVA pathway [27]\u2013[31]. Besides 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), HMGS is a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals and cytoplasmic isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants [3], [4], [32]\u2013[36]. Four genes designated BjHMGS1 to BjHMGS4 encode HMGS in Brassica juncea [34] and investigations revealed that BjHMGS1 is cytosolic. The expression of recombinant BjHMGS1 led to the elucidation of its kinetic and physiological properties [37], [38] and of its crystal structure [39]. Enzyme kinetics of recombinant wild-type (wt) and mutant BjHMGS1 had revealed that H188N showed 8-fold lower enzyme activity and loss of acetoacetyl-CoA inhibition, while S359A displayed a 10-fold higher enzyme activity [37]. Given these interesting results, mutant (H188N, S359A and H188N/S359A) and wt BjHMGS1 were overexpressed in Arabidopsis, which like Brassica, belongs to the family Brassicaceae [4]. BjHMGS1 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis up-regulated several genes in sterol biosynthesis (cf. Figure 1), for instance those encoding HMGR, SMT2 (sterol methyltransferase 2), DWF1 (sterol C-24-reductase), CYP710A1 (sterol C-22 desaturase) and BR6OX2 (brassinosteroid-6-oxidase 2), increasing sterol content and thereby enhancing stress tolerance [4]. Analysis of the Arabidopsis hmgs mutant demonstrated the role of HMGS in tapetal development and pollen fertility [35].",
                "To quickly assess the effects of BjHMGS1 overexpression in a more distant species, the overexpression of BjHMGS1 was carried out on a plant outside the Brassicaceae family. Hence, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi), another model plant from the family of Solanaceae was selected, also because of the easiness of its genetic transformation. Subsequently, the genes downstream of HMGS that were tested encode enzymes that produce intermediates in phytosterol and BR biosynthesis, for instance N. tabacum 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NtHMGR1 and NtHMGR2), isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (NtIPPI1 and NtIPPI2), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (NtFPPS), squalene synthase (NtSQS), sterol methyltransferases (NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-1 and NtSMT2-2) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (NtCYP85A1). In addition, we examined the expression of genes encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (NtGGPPS1, NtGGPPS2, NtGGPPS3 and NtGGPPS4), enzymes that are not implied in the formation of an intermediate in the sterol pathway. Resultant transgenic tobacco (OE-wtBjHMGS1 and OE-S359A) not only showed an increased sterol content but also displayed enhanced plant growth, pod size and seed yield that were not previously observed in transgenic Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs. Furthermore, OE-S359A conferred better plant growth and seed production than OE-wtBjHMGS1, and this was attributed to higher NtSQS expression and total sterol content, realizing the potential application of BjHMGS1 in being quite active in phylogenetically distant species."

Extraction and quantitative analysis of sterols were carried out as described [4], [48]. GC-MS analysis (GC: Hewlett Packard 6890 with an HP-5MS capillary column: 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 \u00b5m; MS: Hewlett Packard 5973 mass selective detector, 70 eV) was used to determine sterol content, with He as the carrier gas (1 ml/min).

The inlet temperature was 280\u00b0C. Compounds were identified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) libraries of peptide tandem mass spectra (Agilent, USA). The sterol masses were determined by comparison of the peak area of each compound with that of the internal standard (lupenyl-3,28-diacetate). Two independent lines for each OE genotype were analysed. Five independent repeats (samples) for each independent line were used for sterol extraction. Each sample was injected twice in GC-MS analyses and an average of the sterol mass was taken. Sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol contents in transgenic tobacco HMGS-OEs were compared to those in vector (pSa13)-transformed plants following previous reports [4], [17]."

The results from qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of NtHMGR1, NtIPPI2, NtSQS, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-1, NtSMT2-2 and NtCYP85A1 was significantly higher than in the vector (pSa13)-transformed control for both OE-wtBjHMGS1 and OE-S359A tobacco seedlings with the exception of NtSQS, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-2 and NtCYP85A1 in one OE-wtBjHMGS1 line (401) (P<0.01) (Figure 7).

Furthermore, tobacco HMGS-OEs show increased pod size and seed yield (Figure 6), indicative of a specific HMGS function in seed production.

                        "In plants, the floral organs are involved in reproduction. HMGS has been shown to play a crucial role in floral development [4], [34], [35], [37]. In Arabidopsis, higher AtHMGS expression had been observed in flowers than seedlings or leaves from RT-PCR analysis [4]. Using mutants in HMGS, AtHMGS was demonstrated essential for pollen fertility and proper development of tapetum-specific organelles in Arabidopsis [35]. In B. juncea, northern blot analysis had previously revealed that BjHMGS1 mRNA was highly expressed in flowers and seedling hypocotyls [34] and in situ hybridization analysis had shown that HMGS mRNA was predominantly localized in the stigmata and ovules of flower buds and in the piths of seedling hypocotyls [37]. BjHMGS1 and BjHMGS2, but not BjHMGS3 and BjHMGS4 expression was detected in the floral buds as examined by RT-PCR analysis [37]. The effect on the overexpression of BjHMGS1 in transgenic tobacco observed herein further extends the significance of HMGS in reproduction related to seed production as well as to whole plant development (Figures 3\u20136). More interestingly, OE-S359A lines were found to display greater effect in growth, pod size and seed yield than OE-wtBjHNMGS1 (Figures 3\u20136). OE-S359A, which was expected to possess higher HMGS activity than OE-wtBjHMGS1, caused higher expression of tobacco native genes downstream of HMGS such as NtSQS, NtHMGR1, NtSMT2-1 and NtCYP85A1 (Figure 7), and increased sterol levels, which more effectively enhanced seed production in comparison to OE- wtBjHMGS1.",
                        "Besides HMGS, other enzymes in the early steps of the MVA pathway are important in these development processes. It has been observed that both hmg1/hmg1 and HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2 Arabidopsis mutants deficient in HMGR activity are male sterile [26], [57]. The hmg1hmg2 male gametophytes in the HMG1/hmg1 hmg2/hmg2 mutant were lethal [57]. Furthermore, the characterization of Arabidopsis AACT1 and AACT2 led to suggest a specific role of AACT2 in catalyzing the first step of the MVA pathway [58], while AACT1 is rather involved in the peroxisomal fatty acid degradation process, like in tobacco seedlings [59]. Arabidopsis AACT2 RNAi lines further showed reduction in apical dominance, seed yield and root length accompanied by sterility and dwarfing [25]. These studies using the AACT RNAi lines, and mutants in HMGS and HMGR together with observations herein confirm the significance of the MVA pathway in plant reproduction and development.",
                        "Recently, two genes were cloned and characterized from two miRNA-action deficient (MAD) mutants; MAD3 encodes the MVA pathway enzyme HMGR1, while MAD4 encodes sterol C-8 isomerase in dedicated sterol biosynthesis [60]. Their results showed that the lack in HMGR1 catalytic activity is sufficient to inhibit miRNA activity and that sterol is essential for the normal activity of plant miRNAs [60]. Furthermore, their results implied that besides sterols, other isoprenoids may also affect the normal function of miRNA [60]. It has been reported that Caenorhabditis elegans HMGS1 (CeHMGS1) plays an important role in the miRNA pathway; CeHMGS1 regulates the function of many, if not all, miRNAs at multiple tissues and stages during C. elegans development [61]. Furthermore, CeHMGS1 affects the fertility of C. elegans in the miRNA defective let-7 worms [61]. This effect on fertility is reminiscent of our observations on tobacco HMGS-OEs herein on seed production which represents fertility in plants."

This study using tobacco HMGS-OEs demonstrated that some differences exist between tobacco and Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs in the expression of genes encoding HMGR and SMT (cf. Figure 1). Although HMGR is considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway in plants [62], only NtHMGR1 but not NtHMGR2 was upregulated in tobacco HMGS-OEs (Figure 7). This can perhaps be attributed to some differences in the localization and function of NtHMGR1 and NtHMGR2 [63], [64]. NtHMGR1 is a house-keeping gene that likely participates in sterol biosynthesis, plant growth and development, while NtHMGR2 is stress-inducible [63], [64]. Also elicitor-inducible HMGR activity is known to be associated with defence-related sesquiterpenoid accumulation in tobacco cell suspension cultures [65]. Thus it was not surprising that rather than NtHMGR2, NtHMGR1 was upregulated in seedlings undergoing rapid growth and development.",
                        "Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI) catalyses the interconversion of IPP and its allyl isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and provides the first key intermediate for the biosynthesis of all kinds of isoprenoids including sterols in the MVA pathway and carotenoids in the MEP pathway [1], [3], [12], [66] (and references cited therein) (cf. Figure 1). IPP is most likely involved in cross-talk between the cytosolic MVA pathway and the plastidial MEP pathway [13], [14]. AtIPPI1 and AtIPPI2 have been reported to be critical to sterol biosynthesis in the MVA pathway and Arabidopsis development [67]. Analysis of the expression of the two NtIPPI genes in tobacco HMGS-OE seedlings revealed that NtIPPI1 was downregulated, while NtIPPI2 was upregulated (Figure 7). Their corresponding proteins are apparently differentially localized in tobacco [68]. NtIPPI1 is targeted to the chloroplast, while NtIPPI2 is cytosolic, similar to BjHMGS1 [37], [68]. Possibly, upregulation of BjHMGS1 and NtIPPI2 in the cytosol of tobacco HMGS-OE seedlings promoted cross-talk between the MVA and MEP pathways. The MEP pathway produces simultaneously IPP and DMAPP, and plastidial NtIPPI1 is possibly needed to adjust the ratio of starter DMAPP to elongation units IPP for longer prenyl chains. If IPP is imported from the cytosol because of \u201coverproduction\u201d, then plastidial NtIPPI1 would be downregulated.",
                        "FPPS catalyses the condensation of two molecules of IPP with DMAPP to form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) (C15) (cf. Figure 1), which provides the key precursor for the biosynthesis of essential isoprenoids such as sesquiterpenes, ubiquinones, polyterpenes, dolichols and sterols [69], [70]. In plants, FPPS isozymes that are encoded by a small gene family, exert differential roles, based on their subcellular localisation [69], [71]. NtFPPS expression was slightly elevated in seedlings of only one OE-wtBjHMGS1 line (Figure 7). Given that NtFPPS functions as the key provider of the universal product FPP in the biosynthesis of many C-15 related products, a moderate change in NtFPPS mRNA in the HMGS-OE lines may not be significant enough to affect sterol accumulation. Also, other NtFPPS isogenes or post-translational regulation may be involved [72]\u2013[74].",
                        "SQS catalyses the biosynthesis of squalene by the reductive dimerization of two FPP molecules (cf. Figure 1), and represents the first committed step in the biosynthesis of sterols, BRs and triterpenes [75]\u2013[79]. The change in NtSQS expression in seedlings was the most dramatic, with a 2.1-fold increase in two lines of OE-wtBjHMGS1 and 36.5-fold in OE-S359A, in comparison to the vector-transformed control (Figure 7). The increase of NtSQS mRNA in OE-S359A seedlings was also much higher (11.1-fold) than OE-wtBjHMGS1 (Figure 7). Interestingly, NtSQS expression and NtSQS activity have been detected predominantly at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) rather than leaves or roots, implying that sterol biosynthesis occurs especially in the SAM [77]. Furthermore, the SAM is critical in plant growth and development, and stem cells from the SAM continuously generate all the aerial organs and tissues of a plant [80]. Results from qRT-PCR (Figure 7) herein support a role for NtSQS in HMGS-associated sterol accumulation related to growth and seed yield. Also, enhanced sterol accumulation, growth and seed yield in OE-S359A, over OE-wtBjHMGS1 (Figure 7), corresponded to higher NtSQS expression (Figure 7). Consistently, Arabidopsis SQS (AtSQS) displayed higher expression in HMGS-OEs than the vector-transformed control; and AtSQS expression in OE-S359A was higher than OE-wtBjHMGS1 (Figure S4). However the elevation of NtSQS in tobacco OE-S359A over OE-wtBjHMGS1 (Figure 7) was greater in comparison to AtSQS in Arabidopsis OE-S359A (Figure S4). Furthermore, our results correspond well to a recent study on the overexpression of Glycine max SQS1 (GmSQS1) in Arabidopsis that yielded a 50% increase of seed sterol content [81]. An enhanced flux of MVA to FPP might present some risk as phosphatases always being present might liberate farnesol, which can be quite toxic to cells [82]. Thus SQS could remove a potentially dangerous intermediate and get it channelled into the synthesis and accumulation of chemically inert sterols and their derivatives.",
                        "In the MEP pathway, GGPPS catalyses the consecutive condensation of three molecules of IPP and one DMAPP to generate the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) (cf. Figure 1), which is the universal key intermediate for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and of abscisic acid as derivative, of gibberellins, chlorophylls, tocopherols, phylloquinone, plastoquinone, dolichols, polyprenols and oligoprenols [12], [83]. Although four GGPPS-like cDNAs have been reported from tobacco [84], only NtGGPPS2 was upregulated in two lines of OE-wtBjHMGS1 and all three lines of OE-S359A, while NtGGPPS1, NtGGPPS3 and NtGGPPS4 were observed to be downregulated in all the HMGS-OE seedlings (Figure 8), implying that HMGS overexpression had a positive effect on NtGGPPS2 expression and a negative role on NtGGPPS1, NtGGPPS3 and NtGGPPS4 expression. However, it cannot be discounted that NtGGPPS1, NtGGPPS3 and NtGGPPS4 may be subject to other modes of regulation such as post-translational modification that has been reported for AtGGPPS3, AtGGPPS7, AtGGPPS9 and AtGGPPS10 [85], [86]. Most recently, a new relationship between the MVA pathway and the MEP pathway has been proposed in which the monoterpene S-carvone inhibited the production of MVA-derived capsidiol, a cellulose-induced sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin in tobacco by down-regulation of MEP-pathway dependent protein isoprenylation [87].",
                        "The overexpression of NtSMT1(cf. Figure 1), which catalyses the conversion of cycloartenol to 24-methylene cycloartanol, considered as the first methylation step in phytosterol biosynthesis, resulted in a higher total sterol content in tobacco seeds [88]\u2013[90]. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing AtSMT2/NtSMT2, which converts 24-methylene lophenol to 24-ethylidene lophenol, showed an increase in sitosterol but not total sterol content [91]\u2013[94]. HMGS overexpression in tobacco upregulated both NtSMT1 and NtSMT2 expression in seedlings of all three OE-S359A lines and two OE-wtBjHMGS1 lines with the exception of OE-wtBjHMGS1 line 401 (Figure 7). The upregulation of SMT2 was also observed in 21-d-old rosette leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing BjHMGS1 [4]. Our results suggest that NtSMT1 affects HMGS-associated sterol accumulation, which had not been previously observed in transgenic Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs [4].",
                        "BR is a steroid hormone essential for plant growth and development [95]. Several mutants in BR biosynthesis affect seed yield [6], [22]\u2013[24]. The cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (CYP85A family) are involved in the last several oxidative reactions in the BR pathway [96]. In Arabidopsis, two members of CYP85A exist: AtCYP85A1 (brassinosteroid-6-oxidase 1, BR60X1) that catalyses several reactions in the biosynthesis of castasterone [97], and AtCYP85A2 (BR60X2) in the conversion of castasterone to brassinolide [96]. The Arabidopsis cyp85a1 mutant showed a semi-sterile phenotype and the cyp85a2 mutant exhibited dwarfness and reduced fertility [96]\u2013[97]. The cyp85a1/cyp85a2 double mutants displayed severe dwarfism [96]. To test the effect in HMGS overexpression on BR biosynthesis, NtCYP85A1 (cf. Figure 1) mRNA was measured in tobacco HMGS-OE seedlings and was observed to significantly increase in all three OE-S359A lines and two OE-wtBjHMGS1 lines with the exception of OE-wtBjHMGS1 line 401 (Figure 7). Although OE-wtBjHMGS1 line 401 did not show higher expression in NtCYP85A1, as well as in NtSQS, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-2 and NtGGPPS2, the expression of all these genes were maintained a level similar to the control (Figures 7\u20138). Furthermore, NtHMGR1, NtIPPI2 and NtSMT2-1 displayed significantly higher expression in this line than the control (Figure 7), implying that they positively affected plant growth and seed yield. Taken together with observations on a general up-regulation of AtCYP85A2 (BR60X2) in 21-d-old rosette leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing BjHMGS1 [4], our studies reinforce that HMGS overexpression likely leads to upregulation of BR synthesis, and thereby promotes growth and seed production."
