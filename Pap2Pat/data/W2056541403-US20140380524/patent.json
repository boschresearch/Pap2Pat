                        "It is desirable in modern agriculture to improve growth and/or seed yield because seed grains represent an important source of food (Jiao et al., Nat. Genet., 42:541-544, 2010). To this end, the key genes that boost seed yield must first be identified. The enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) are involved in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway (Lynen et al., Biochem. Z. 330:269-295, 1958; Ferguson Jr. and Rudney, J. Biol. Chem. 234:1072-1075, 1959; Rudney and Ferguson Jr., J. Biol. Chem. 234:1076-1080, 1959; Lynen, Pure Appl. Chem. 14:137-167, 1967; Stewart and Rudney, J. Biol. Chem. 241:1222-1225, 1966; Balasubramanlam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:1421-1425, 1977). Besides HMGR, HMGS is also a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis in the mammals as well as in plants (Kimberly et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273:1349-1356, 1998; Alex et al., Plant J. 22:415-426, 2000; Wang et al., Plant Biotechnol. J. 10:31-42, 2012). In plants, studies focused initially on HMGR, and interest in HMGS occurred later (Bach, Lipids, 21:82-88, 1986; Alex et al., Plant J. 22:415-426, 2000; Ishiguro et al., Plant Cell Physiol. 51:896-911, 2010; Hemmerlin et al., Prog. Lipid. Res. 51:95-148, 2012). Four genes (BjHMGS1-BjHMGS4) encode HMGS in Brassica juncea (Alex et al., Plant J. 22:415-426, 2000). Investigations on BjHMGS1 revealed that it is localized to the cytosol and the expression of its recombinant protein in Escherichia coli led to the elucidation of its crystal structure (Nagegowda et al., Biochem. J. 383:517-527, 2004; Nagegowda et al., Planta 221:844-856, 2005; Pojer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103:11491-11496, 2006). Analysis of the Arabidopsis hmgs mutant revealed that HMGS is involved in tapetal development and affects the fertility of pollen grains (Ishiguro et al., Plant Cell Physiol. 51:896-911, 2010). Overexpression of wild-type and mutant BjHMGS1 (H188N, S359A and H188N/S359A) has been recently investigated in transgenic Arabidopsis, which showed that BjHMGS1 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis up-regulated several genes in sterol biosynthesis including HMGR, SMT2, DWF1, CYP710A1 and BR6OX2, culminating in an increased sterol content by about 11.3 to 26.8% as well as in enhanced stress tolerance such as Botrytis cinerea resistance and H2O2 tolerance (Wang et al., Plant Biotechnol. J. 10:31-42, 2012). However, the same study showed that BjHMGS1 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis did not lead to any obvious phenotype change in plant growth or an increase in seed yield. Only more rapid seed germination was apparent when BjHMGS1 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis.",

Generally, DNA sequences encoding the structural coding sequence can be assembled from cDNA fragments and short oligonucleotide linkers, or from a series of synthetic oligonucleotides, to provide a synthetic nucleic acid which is capable of being expressed from a recombinant transcriptional unit contained in a cell or in a cell-free transcription and translation system. Such sequences can be provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal non-translated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in eukaryotic genes. Genomic DNA comprising the relevant sequences can also be used in the formation of a recombinant gene or transcriptional unit. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present at 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 from the open reading frame, where such sequences do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions, and may indeed act to modulate production of a desired product by various mechanisms (see \u201cDNA regulatory sequences\u201d, below). Thus, as used herein, the term \u201crecombinant\u201d polynucleotide or nucleic acid refers to one which is not naturally occurring (e.g., made by artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence through human intervention). This artificial combination is often accomplished by either chemical synthesis means, or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, e.g., by genetic engineering techniques. Such is usually done to replace a codon with a redundant codon encoding the same or a conservative amino acid, while typically introducing or removing a sequence recognition site. Alternatively, it is performed to join together nucleic acid segments of desired functions to generate a desired combination of functions.",

Genetic change (\u201cmodification\u201d) can be accomplished either by incorporation of the new DNA into the genome of the host cell, or by transient or stable maintenance of the new DNA as an episomal element. Where the cell is a eukaryotic cell, a permanent genetic change is generally achieved by introduction of the DNA into the genome of the cell or into a plastome of the cell. In prokaryotic cells, permanent changes can be introduced into the chromosome or via extrachromosomal elements such as plasmids, plastids, and expression vectors, which may contain one or more selectable markers to aid in their maintenance in the recombinant host cell.",

Selectable marker genes that have been used extensively in plants include, but are not limited to, the neomycin phosphotransferase gene nptII (U.S. Pat.

No. 6,444,878), and a positive/negative system that utilizes D-amino acids (Erikson, et al., Nat Biotechnol, 22:455-8 (2004)). European Patent Publication No. EP 0 530 129 describes a positive selection system which enables the transformed plants to outgrow the non-transformed lines by expressing a transgene encoding an enzyme that activates an inactive compound added to the growth media. U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,378 describes the use of mannose or xylose for the positive selection of transgenic plants.

An improved version of the DsRed protein has been developed (Bevis and Glick, Nat Biotech, 20:83-87 (2002)) for reducing aggregation of the protein. Visual selection can also be performed with the yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP) including the variant with accelerated maturation of the signal (Nagai, et al., Nat Biotech., 20:87-90 (2002)), the blue fluorescent protein, the cyan fluorescent protein, and the green fluorescent protein (Sheen, et al., Plant J, 8:777-84 (1995); Davis and Vierstra, Plant Molecular Biology, 36:521-528 (1998)).

Improved versions of many of the fluorescent proteins have been made for various applications. Use of the improved versions of these proteins or the use of combinations of these proteins for selection of transformants will be obvious to those skilled in the art. It is also practical to simply analyze progeny from transformation events for the presence of the BjHMGS1 thereby avoiding the use of any selectable marker.",

USA, 90:913-917 (1993); Svab and Maliga, EMBO J. 12:601-606 (1993) and Staub and Maliga, Plant J. 6:547-553 (1994); Kuehnle, US Publication No. 2009/7618819. The method relies on particle gun delivery of DNA containing a selectable marker and targeting of the DNA to the plastid genome through homologous recombination. Additionally, plastid transformation may be accomplished by transactivation of a silent plastid-borne transgene by tissue-preferred expression of a nuclear-encoded and plastid-directed RNA polymerase (McBride, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:7301-7305 (1994)) or by use of an integrase, such as the phiC31 phage site-specific integrase, to target the gene insertion to a previously inserted phage attachment site (Lutz, et al., Plant J, 37:906-13 (2004)). Plastid transformation vectors can be designed such that the transgenes are expressed from a promoter sequence that has been inserted with the transgene during the plastid transformation process, or alternatively, from an endogenous plastidial promoter such that an extension of an existing plastidial operon is achieved (Herz, et al., Transgenic Research, 14:969-982 (2005)). An alternative method for plastid transformation as described in WO 2010/061186, wherein RNA produced in the nucleus of a plant cell can be targeted to the plastid genome, can also be used. Inducible gene expression from the plastid genome using a synthetic riboswitch has also been reported (Verhounig, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107: 6204-6209 (2010)). Methods for designing plastid transformation vectors are described by Lutz, et al., Plant Physiol, 145:1201-10 (2007).",

For instance, selection may be performed by growing the engineered plant material on media containing inhibitory amount of the antibiotic or herbicide to which the transforming gene construct confers resistance. Particularly, the selectable marker gene nptII, which specifies kanamycin-resistance, can be used in nuclear transformation. As another example, transformed plants and plant materials may be identified by screening for the activities of any visible marker genes (e.g., the \u03b2-glucuronidase, luciferase, B or Cl genes) that may be present on the vectors described herein. Such selection and screening methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art.

These plants may be grown, pollinated with either the same transformed variety or different varieties, to result in hybrids having constitutive expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that constitutive expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited, and then seeds are harvested to ensure constitutive expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic. An isolated transformant may be regenerated into a plant and progeny thereof (including the immediate and subsequent generations) via sexual or asexual reproduction or growth. Alternatively, the engineered plant material may be regenerated into a plant before subjecting the derived plant to selection or screening for the marker gene traits. Procedures for regenerating plants from plant cells, tissues or organs, either before or after selecting or screening for marker gene(s), are well known to those skilled in the art.",

When an exogenous nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes an HMGS1 or HMGS1-like polypeptide is introduced into the host cell, growth and reproduction of the test cell is enhanced. Thus, an increase in growth and reproduction indicates that the exogenous nucleic acid encodes an HMGS1 or HMGS1-like polypeptide, wherein the encoded polypeptide is produced at a level and/or has an activity that promotes growth and reproduction. The increase in growth and reproduction is observed to be at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or more, as compared to a non-genetically-modified host.",

Mutations can also be introduced into a nucleic acid as a result of a deficiency in a DNA repair enzyme in a cell, e.g., the presence in a cell of a mutant gene encoding a mutant DNA repair enzyme is expected to generate a high frequency of mutations (i.e., about 1 mutation/100 genes-1 mutation/10,000 genes) in the genome of the cell. Examples of genes encoding DNA repair enzymes include but are not limited to Mut H, Mut S, Mut L, and Mut U, and the homologs thereof in other species (e.g., MSH 1 6, PMS 1 2, MLH 1, GTBP, ERCC-1, and the like). Methods of mutating nucleic acids are well known in the art, and any known method is suitable for use. See, e.g., Stemple, Nature Reviews, 5:1-7 (2004); Chiang, et al. PCR Methods Appl., 2(3):210-217 (2003); Stemmer, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:10747-10751 (1994); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,033,861, and 6,773,900.",
                                "Thus, for example, a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a naturally-occurring HMGS1 is exposed to a chemical mutagen, as described above, or subjected to radiation mutation, or subjected to an error-prone PCR, and the mutagenized nucleic acid introduced into a genetically modified host cell(s) as described above. Methods for random mutagenesis using a \u201cmutator\u201d strain of bacteria are also well known in the art and can be used to generate a variant HMGS (see, e.g., Greener, et al., Methods in Molecular Biology, 57:375-385 (1995)). Saturation mutagenesis techniques employing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are also well known and can be used (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,820). Nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a variant HMGS are identified by the ability to relieve growth inhibition caused by lead."

Wild-type and mutant BjHMGS1 (H188N, S359A and H188N/S359A) were overexpressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi). Transgenic HMGS-overexpressor (OE)-S359A and OE-H188N/S359A displayed an increase in plant growth that was not obvious from previous analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs (Wang et al., Plant Biotechnol. J. 10:31-42, (2012)). Also, unlike transgenic Arabidopsis HMGS-OEs, tobacco overexpressing wild-type BjHMGS1 and mutant BjHMGS1 (OE-S359A) showed an increase (27% and 67%, respectively) in seed yield.",
                                "The above examples demonstrated that wild-type BjHMGS1 and mutant BjHMGS1, when overexpressed in tobacco, induced the expression of NtHMGR1 (FIGS. 1-2). The data also showed that transgenic tobacco overexpressing BjHMGS1 (HMGS-OEs) grows quicker, perhaps as a consequence of sterol accumulation in tobacco seedlings (FIGS. 3-6; Tables 1 and 2). Surprisingly, tobacco HMGS-OEs including OE-wtBjHMGS1 and OE-S359A showed 27% and 67% increase in seed yield, which may have arisen from the elevated sterol content in tobacco flowers (11.0-25.3%) (FIG. 7; Tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, the expression of some HMGS downstream genes, sterol intermediates biosynthetic genes and BR biosynthetic genes including NtHMGR1, NtIPI2, NtSQS, NtSMT1-2, NtSMT2-1, NtSMT2-2 and NtCYP85A1 were up-regulated, while the expression of NtIPI1 and NtGGPPS1 were down-regulated, in tobacco seedlings of OE-wtBjHMGS1 and OE-S359A (FIG. 8). The expression of NtHMGR1, NtIPI1, NtIPI2, NtFPPS, NtSQS, NtSMT1-2 and NtCYP85A1 were up-regulated, while the expression of NtHMGR2 was down-regulated, in tobacco flowers of OE-wtBjHMGS1 and OE-S359A (FIG. 9). Hence, HMGS is demonstrated herein to play an important role in plant growth and seed (grain) production by boosting seed yield besides increasing phytosterol content. It is anticipated that the growth and/or seed yield enhancement effect of overexpression of wild-type and mutant BjHMGS1 in tobacco can be extended to other plant species of the Solanaceae family. Provided herein is a new use of wild-type and mutant BjHMGS1 in enhancing plant growth and increasing seed yield, which would benefit food production in agriculture. Additionally, enhanced plant growth shortens time for harvest, which can be applied to forage, food crops, fiber crops, etc."
