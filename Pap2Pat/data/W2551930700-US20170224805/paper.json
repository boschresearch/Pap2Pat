    "title": "Systemic and mucosal immune responses following oral adenoviral delivery of influenza vaccine to the human intestine by radio controlled capsule",
    "date": "2016-11-24",
    "abstract": "There are several benefits of oral immunization including the ability to elicit mucosal immune responses that may protect against pathogens that invade through a mucosal surface. Our understanding of human immune biology is hampered by the difficulty in isolating mucosal cells from humans, and the fact that animal models may or may not completely mirror human intestinal immunobiology. In this human pharmacodynamic study, a novel adenovirus vector-based platform expressing influenza hemagglutinin was explored. We used radio-controlled capsules to deliver the vaccine to either the jejunum or the ileum. The resulting immune responses induced by immunization at each of the intestinal sites were investigated. Both intestinal sites were capable of inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses to influenza hemagglutinin, but ileum delivery induced higher numbers of antibody secreting cells of IgG and IgA isotypes, increased mucosal homing B cells, and higher number of vaccine responders. Overall, these data provided substantial insights into human mucosal inductive sites, and aided in the design and selection of indications that could be used with this oral vaccine platform.",

In order measure changes in total IgG titers post immunization, we plotted OD versus dilution curves for each subject pre and post immunization and calculated an EC50 value for each curve. If there was an increase in the change of EC50 greater than 1.3, the subject was scored as a positive (1.3 was found in earlier studies to be associated with real gains versus background noise).

An ASC assay measures the numbers of HA specific pre-plasma B cells, but it does not determine tissue homing potential. Therefore, a flow cytometric approach was taken to analyze the capacity of ASCs (particularly IgA ASCs) to migrate to mucosal tissues post vaccination. The process of selective ASC homing is dependent on the binding of tissue-specific cell adhesion molecules. The most characterized adhesion molecule mediating an intestinal homing is the heterodimeric integrin \u03b14\u03b2714. Vascular endothelial cells that line the blood vessels within the intestinal mucosa constitutively express MAdCAM-1 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1) and the migration of primed B cells into the intestinal mucosa is dependent on interactions between MAdCAM-1 and high levels of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin on B cells14151617.",

The Ileum treated group trended higher for percentage of intestinal homing B cells (Fig. 6G), but the jejunum treated group trended higher in the generation of non-intestinal mucosal homing B cells (Fig. 6H). These were not significantly different (Mann-Whitney test).",
                        "In summary, the oral vaccine generated a substantial B cell population with intestinal tropism that includes (1) \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high)CD27(high)IgA(+) pre-plasma B cells and (2) \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high)CD27(intermediate) IgA(+) memory B cells. In addition, a smaller population of non-intestinal mucosal homing pre-plasma B cells (\u03b14+\u03b27(intermediate)/\u03b14+\u03b21+IgA(+) and \u03b14+\u03b27(negative)/\u03b14+\u03b21+IgA(+)) were also generated (Fig. 7)."

                "The use of RCC technology provided valuable information on the biological performance of the rAd oral vaccine released in liquid form, subsequently leading to the development of an effective enteric-coated tablet. Tablets are a desired format for drug and vaccine delivery due to easier administration, rapid distribution, and user preference. However, given the experimental design of the RCC study (direct delivery to the ileum or jejunum) and the willingness of the study participants, closer examination of human mucosal immune responses in humans was performed with this study.",
                "The induction of antigen-specific B cell response after oral immunization is largely dependent on germinal centers in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) consisting of Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs) and isolated lymphoid follicles as well as in the gut-draining mesenteric lymphoid nodes (MLN). PPs are considered to be the major inductive sites and are more prevalent in the human ileum than the jejunum. This would suggest the ileum would be a more ideal region for vaccine release. In contrast, published studies in sheep demonstrated that jejunum delivery of rAd was more potent than ileum delivery for the ability to elicit immune responses against transgene20. This study using the RCC technology allowed us to answer questions about the potency of each site in humans.",
                "We observed higher responder rates and higher HA-specific ASCs numbers when the rAd oral vaccine was released into the ileum. In terms of HAI titers, up to 67% seroconversion was seen with the ileum group. This rate is similar to that reported in our recently published paper using tablets with enteric coatings that target release to the ileum where 75% seroconversion was observed7. Given that injected commercial vaccines have obtained H1N1 seroconversions between 45 and 65% in subjects21, these results suggest that oral immunization with rAd could generate comparable response rates. The vaccine delivery to the ileum appeared to trend toward an improved antibody performance and higher \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) B cell induction compared to delivery to the jejunum. This finding suggests that more efficient immune induction might occur when the rAd oral vaccine was released in the ileum. There are several reasons why the ileum might be more efficient in immune induction, including the observation that the area has denser lymphoid clusters. The jejunum site was less efficient, but both IgG and IgA ASCs responses as well as \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) mucosal B cells were induced in individual subjects in this group. For the vaccine released in the jejunum, the induction sites could be local PPs in the jejunum, or induction sites could be PPs in the ileum if the rAd reached the ileum via jejunum release and transit. Another possible inductive site can be MLN. The antigen could have drained into the MLNs and B cells could be primed in MLN instead of GALT16.",
                "After naive B cells are primed in GALT or MLNs, they leave the lymph nodes via draining lymphatics and re-enter the blood circulation via the thoracic duct. The \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) integrins are intestinal specific homing receptors that direct primed IgA positive B cells into the effector tissue, the intestinal lamina propria. This \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) phenotype is predominantly induced after oral immunization, whereas systemic immunization preferentially induced CD62L expression in humans22. Consistently, we found a large proportion of \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) B cells in peripheral blood after intestinal delivery of our vaccine (Fig. 5A and B). While no placebo subjects were enrolled in this study, the increase in this \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) phenotype was also observed in our vaccine tablet participants and not in the placebo treated subjects (L. Kim, unpublished results). CCL25, the ligand for CCR9 is constitutively expressed at high levels by epithelial cells of the small intestine23. We found CCR9 was co-expressed with cells of the \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high) phenotype (Fig. 5F).",
                "Intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) have the capacity to drive the expression of CCR9 and \u03b14\u03b27 on lymphocytes through retinoic acid (a metabolic product of vitamin A) production24. In addition, together with unique intestinal cytokine milieu, dendritic cells play an essential role for IgA induction in the intestines. Thus co-expression of \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR9 targets the efficient recruitment of IgA-expressing plasmablasts to the small intestinal lamina propria, and likely represents the eventual destination of the recently activated \u03b27(hi) cells in our study.",
                "We were able to measure HA-specific IgA with fecal and nasal samples in several subjects post immunization. In terms of fecal analysis, we found HA-specific IgA increases in several subjects, but not all. One reason why human fecal sampling is a less reliable method of studying mucosal secretory IgA responses is because the human intestines contain various proteolytic enzymes2526. We added a mixture of protease inhibitors to the fecal extraction buffer to help with recovery of fecal IgA, but in some cases the sample may have been held for periods over 24\u2009hours before processing. For ileum vaccine delivered subjects, 92% had a detectable \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high)population in the peripheral blood post immunization, but only 42% of subjects had a detectable increase in HA specific IgA in fecal samples. In terms of nasal IgA, we also observed some subjects with an increase in specific IgA to HA post immunization. Although background was high because most humans have been previously infected by influenza, we did detect a 2-fold rise in about 50% and 33% of the subjects after ileum or jejunum vaccine release, respectively. By gating on CD27(high), a marker of recently activated cells, we found a population of \u03b14\u2009+\u2009\u03b27(negative)/\u03b14+\u03b21+B cells, which have been identified for their ability to home to the nose and bronchi19. Of those, approximately 30% were surface IgA positive and might have contributed to the SIgA response in the nasal samples in this study. These data suggest that a flow cytometric approach has a higher degree of sensitivity for measuring possible vaccine specific mucosal immune responses in humans.",
                "The rAd oral vaccine also generated \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high)CD27(intermediate) B cells, evidence of a memory mucosal homing response. Influenza vaccine efficacy has traditionally been measured by serum neutralizing antibodies, and the potential contributions of a mucosal response to protection rarely documented, such as in the study by Ambrose, et al.27. The use of human challenge studies has allowed the importance of IgA responses to be more thoroughly evaluated for protection against disease in several disease models. Following challenge with RSV, Habibi, et al., found that the preexisting IgA responses correlated with protection better than serum neutralizing responses, and that RSV infection seemed to be defective in the generation of a memory RSV specific IgA response28. Further, in the norovirus challenge studies by Lindesmith, et al., a rapid mucosal IgA response against norovirus was found to correlate with protection against infection29. The rapid response is likely to have been induced through stimulation of memory IgA cells, given the speed of the antigen specific response within only a few days after exposure to norovirus. Additional studies in mice have pointed to the importance of the \u03b14(high)\u03b27(high)CD27(intermediate) phenotype as well; among memory B cells, only \u03b14\u03b27 (but not \u03b14+\u03b27(negative)) cells gave protection against rotavirus infection in a mouse model30. As development of our rAd oral vaccine platform proceeds into a commercial tablet format, the induction of robust mucosal immune responses may be exploited for protection from pathogens that infect and proliferate in the mucosa."
