                        "Vaccines are an important means for preventing and/or treating a number of diseases and disorders (e.g., viral infection, bacterial infection, and cancer). Vaccinization is typically carried out using injection, which reduces participation due to inconvenience of traveling to a vaccination site and aversion to injections. Furthermore, injection of vaccines requires use of sterile kit, such as syringes and needles, and a skilled practitioner to administer.",
                        "For the influenza vaccine, large-scale yearly campaigns are conducted to collect enough fertilized eggs to harvest and process sufficient virus to meet the needs of the market. Cell culture or plant derived hemagglutinin (HA) may reduce the burden of egg acquisition and processing, but these approaches still require expensive sterile fill and finish to produce individual syringe needles, that need to be disposed of as a biohazard. During a pandemic, schools can be closed and social distancing mandated, yet mass influenza immunization typically requires lining up subjects at health clinics for injections. Oral vaccines, for influenza or other pathogens, could be sent through the mail thus avoiding most human to human contact. Further, tableting is a rapid, sanitary process that does not require the expensive sterile fill and finishing process that injected vaccines require.",

Immunogenic agents are typically \u201cforeign\u201d to the host, e.g., from a different species, or from a bacteria, virus, or fungus. A non-foreign agent can be immunogenic, e.g., in the case of an autoimmune response. Certain cancer cell-specific agents can be exploited as immunogenic agents, allowing the host's immune system to attack the cancer.",

Biological agents are distinguished from small molecule drugs in that they can be created by biological processes (including recombinant techniques) instead of chemical synthesis. Biological agents can, however, be chemically modified or include non-natural nucleotides or amino acids. Biological agents can also be non-naturally occurring, e.g., recombinant or chimeric entities.",
                                "As used herein, an \u201cimmunogenic biological agent\u201d refers to an agent that acts directly as an antigen (e.g., is recognized by a T cell receptor or antibody), or an agent that, once expressed in a cell, acts as an antigen. For example, an immunogenic biological agent can include an expression vector encoding an immunogenic polypeptide.",
                                "The term \u201cantigen\u201d refers to a polypeptide, glycoprotein, lipoprotein, lipid, carbohydrate, or other agent that is bound (e.g., recognized as \u201cforeign\u201d) by a T cell receptor and/or antibody. Antigens are commonly derived from bacterial, viral, or fungal sources. The term \u201cderived from\u201d indicates that the antigen is essentially as it exists in its natural antigenic context, or that it has been modified to be expressed under certain conditions, to include only the most immunogenic portion, or to remove other potentially harmful associated components, etc.",
                                "An \u201cimmunogenically effective dose or amount\u201d of a composition as described herein is an amount that elicits or modulates an immune response specific for an antigen selected for vaccination. Immune responses include humoral immune responses and cell-mediated immune responses. An immunogenic composition can be used therapeutically or prophylactically to treat or prevent disease at any stage.",

Cell-mediated immune responses are mediated at least in part by T cells, and can be detected, e.g., by detecting T cell-specific cytokines or increase in T cell growth.",

                                "An agent, such as an enteric coating, matrix, or capsule, is said to retain an encompassed or embedded therapeutic agent when at least 60%, e.g., at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100% of the original administered amount of therapeutic agent remains encompassed or embedded within the agent. The agent, e.g., enteric coating or matrix, is typically designed to disintegrate under certain conditions and release the therapeutic agent. Disintegration can be gradual, e.g., in the case of a thicker or more chemically complex coating. The enteric coating is said to \u201cdisintegrate\u201d once the coating thickness is reduced at least 10%, e.g., at least 25%, 50%, or 75% compared to the original administered thickness. Disintegration is not an absolute term, as it can occur over a different time course depending on conditions. For example, a coating that is designed to disintegrate in 5 minutes at pH 6.5 may disintegrate, albeit slowly, at pH 6 (e.g., in 1 hour). Disintegration does not necessarily indicate that the encompassed or embedded therapeutic agent is released. The therapeutic agent can, however, begin to be released before the enteric coating or matrix is entirely disintegrated.",

Thus, for example, chimeric and recombinant vectors include nucleic acid sequences that are not found within the native (non-chimeric or non-recombinant) form of the vector. A chimeric viral expression vector refers to a viral expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a heterologous (e.g., immunogenic) polypeptide.",

The expression vector can be part of a plasmid, virus, or nucleic acid fragment. Typically, the expression vector includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a promoter. Viral expression vectors are typically rendered replication incompetent or attenuated. A virally-derived vector can include the components of the expression vector required for expression of a desired sequence, but omit those involved in, e.g., replication or other pathogenic effects.",

Promoter sequences are typically near the start site of transcription, such as a TATA element in the case of a polymerase II type promoter. A promoter can also include distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. Promoters include constitutive and inducible promoters. A \u201cconstitutive\u201d promoter is a promoter that is active under most environmental and developmental conditions. An \u201cinducible\u201d promoter is a promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. The term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to a functional linkage between a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, or array of transcription factor binding sites) and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the expression control sequence directs transcription of the nucleic acid corresponding to the second sequence.",

For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, heterologous portions of a protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein). A heterologous nucleic acid or protein is one that is not found in a particular environment in nature, e.g., a heterologous mouse protein in a human cell.",

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.",

In the context of the present disclosure, an example of a negative control would be a biological sample from a known healthy (non-infected) individual, and an example of a positive control would be a biological sample from a known infected patient. A control can also represent an average value or a range gathered from a number of tests or results. One of skill in the art will recognize that controls can be designed for assessment of any number of parameters.

For production, the replication deficient vector can be administered to a cell that expresses the E1 gene such that recombinant adenovirus (rAd) is produced by the cell. This rAd can be harvested and used for a single round of infection to deliver the transgenic composition to another cell within a mammal in order to elicit immune responses to an encoded polypeptide antigen.",

Other suitable adenoviral vectors include strains 2, orally tested strains 4 and 7, enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41, and other strains (e.g. Ad34, Ad26, or Ad35) that are sufficient for delivering an antigen and eliciting an adaptive immune response to the transgene antigen [Lubeck et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86(17), 6763-6767 (1989); Shen et al., J Virol, 75(9), 4297-4307 (2001); Bailey et al., Virology, 202(2), 695-706 (1994)]. The viral vector does not need to have been isolated from humans, but can come from a non-human such as chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3) (see, e.g., Colloca et al. (2012) Sci. Transl. Med. 4:115; Stanley et al. (2014) Nat. Med. doi:10.1038/nm.3702).

For example, commonly used promoters and enhancers are derived, e.g., from beta actin, adenovirus, simian virus (SV40), and human cytomegalovirus (CMV). For example, vectors allowing expression of proteins under the direction of the CMV promoter, SV40 early promoter, SV40 later promoter, metallothionein promoter, murine mammary tumor virus promoter, Rous sarcoma virus promoter, transducer promoter, or other promoters shown effective for expression in mammalian cells are suitable. Additional viral and non-viral promoter, control and/or signal sequences may be used, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host cells to be transfected.",

The pharmaceutical composition can be used prophylactically or therapeutically as a vaccine to avoid or reduce a viral infection, bacterial infection, parasitic infection, fungal infection, or cancer. The pharmaceutical compositions can be used to treat at any stage, e.g., at the pre-cancer, cancer, or metastatic stages, or to prevent disease or infection.",

Within such methods, pharmaceutical compositions are typically administered to an individual that may or may not be afflicted with the disease, disorder, or infection. In some embodiments, a disease, disorder, or infection is diagnosed prior to administration, e.g., using criteria generally accepted in the art. For example, viral infection may be diagnosed by the measurement of viral titer in a sample from the patient, bacterial infection may be diagnosed by detecting the bacteria in a sample from the patient, and cancer may be diagnosed by detecting the presence of a malignant tumor. Pharmaceutical compositions can be administered either prior to or following surgical removal of primary tumors and/or treatment such as administration of radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.",

Typically, between 1 and 52 doses can be administered over a 52 week period. In some embodiments, 3 doses are administered, at intervals of 1 month, or 2-3 doses are administered every 2-3 months. In some embodiments, a combination of more than one antigen can be administered simultaneously or sequentially, e.g., an annual influenza vaccine that contains individual components directed at each subtype of influenza or multiple clades within a subtype. In some embodiments, the intervals are more like once a year, e.g., an annual flu vaccine based on the particular current strain. Booster vaccinations can be given periodically thereafter. Alternate protocols may be appropriate for individual patients and particular diseases and disorders.",

Such response can be monitored by measuring the anti-tumor antibodies in a patient or by vaccine-dependent generation of cytolytic T cells capable of killing, e.g., the patient's tumor cells, the patient's virally infected cells, or the patient's bacterially infected cells in vitro. Such vaccines can also generate an immune response that leads to an improved clinical outcome (e.g., complete or partial or longer disease-free survival, reduced viral titers) in vaccinated patients as compared to non-vaccinated patients, or patients receiving non-ileum targeted treatment.",

Samples of body fluid taken from an individual prior to and subsequent to initiation of therapy (e.g., ileum-targeted therapy) may be analyzed for the immunocomplexes using known methods. Briefly, the number of immunocomplexes detected in both samples is compared. A significant change in the number of immunocomplexes in the second sample (post-targeted therapy) relative to the first sample (pre-targeted therapy) reflects successful therapy."

These results show that neutralizing antibody titers to influenza are being generated by oral immunization, with a greater than 3 fold increase in the GMT after immunization in the high dose group. These results show that L 100 coated tablets can be used for vaccine delivery to the intestine.",

In duplicate, tablets prepared with each coating polymer, and at each level of coating application, were pre-exposed to USP simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.6, no pepsin) for 120 minutes in a VanKel Bio-Dis III reciprocating cylinder dissolution test apparatus at 37\u00b0 C. at a reciprocation rate of 10 dips per minute (DPM). The tablets were then transferred to USP simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 6.8, no pancreatin). Tablets were observed for disintegration and the time to complete disintegration of both tablets was recorded to the nearest 5 minutes. The data indicate that disintegration time is influenced by both polymer composition and thickness and provide guidance with regard to proper selection of coating composition to influence the behavior of the coatings after tablets exit the stomach.",

The GMT for the vaccine group rose to 247 (95 CI: 89-685) versus no rise in the placebo for a day 28 GMT of 9\u20226 (95 CI: 5-18). These calculations had no impact on the vaccine group, as none of the subjects had high initial MN or HAI titers.

Results show that ASCs could be reliably measured on day 7 in the vaccine-treated group (FIG. 7D). Background ASCs were generally negligible on day 0. For the vaccine treated group, an average of 992 (+/\u2212std err 209, 95% CI: 532-1452) IgG ASCs and 337 IgA ASCs (+/\u2212std err 104, 95% CI: 117-580) each per 1\u00d7106 PBMC were found for day 7, with only one subject out of 12 having no detectable ASC response. The placebo group had no IgA spots on day 7, but one subject had a high background smear and a measurable IgG ASC response with smaller spots than normally observed. The treated group was significantly different than placebo in terms of the ability to elicit an IgG or an IgA ASC response at day 7 (P=0.0007 and P=0.008 respectively by T Test).",

Following oral immunization, a few vaccine-treated subjects had an increase in neutralizing antibody responses to Ad5, which led to a 2.6-fold increase in the GM neutralizing antibody titers, compared to 1.0-fold GM fold rise in the placebo treated subjects. In the vaccine group, HAI and MN responses trended similarly for individual subjects. Eight subjects were Ad5 negative before immunization, and four were Ad5 positive before immunization. One subject that was Ad5 positive did not HAI seroconvert, however, one subject that was Ad5 positive had the highest increase in HAI titers (64 fold) of any of the subjects in the study. This same subject had a gain in MN titers of 362 fold without any increase in the Ad5 neutralizing antibody titers pre and post immunization.

(2012) PloS one 7:e34581). In another study, the SC rate to H1N1 was found to be 45% for one injection of 45 ug of HA protein (without adjuvant) (Gordon et al. (2012) Vaccine 30:5407), while in another, the H1N1 vaccine was highly immunogenic with a 78% SC rate observed after 1 dose of a split vaccine (Greenberg et al. (2009) 361:2405).",

In the present tablet study, the HAI SC rate among vaccine treated subjects was 75% with over 92% of subjects having a 4-fold rise in HAI titers (FIG. 7A). MN titers were higher than the HAI titers. It is possible that the MN assay is more sensitive or that the oral rAd based vaccine elicits stronger neutralizing responses outside the head region than protein injected vaccines.",
                                "HAI responses are elicited with injected commercial vaccines, but HAI titers are known to wane. For example, non-HIV infected volunteers had a 67% drop in GMT HAI titers between 1 and 6 months post immunization (Crum-Cianflone et al. (2011) Vaccine 29:3183). Similarly, the percentage of seroprotected subjects dropped from 75% to 56% for HIV negative subjects that enrolled with seronegative HAI titers (\u22661:10). Studies with pandemic influenza vaccines have also shown decreases in durability. In the AS03 avian influenza vaccine study, the GMT reached 563 after 2 vaccine doses, but at 6 months post immunization, the GMT had dropped to 18, a 96% decrease (Leroux-Roels et al. (2010) Vaccine 28:849). In the present tablet vaccine study, the percentage of seroprotected subjects remained constant at 75% at 1 and 6 months post immunization, and the HAI GMT titer drop was less dramatic showing only a 28% decrease (FIG. 7B). One possibility is that the durability is better for vector-based vaccines because of enhanced T cell responses.",
