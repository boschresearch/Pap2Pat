### Differential Analysis Obstruction

- thwart differential analysis attacks
- introduce signal distortions in preprocessing stage
- distortions must be different in each tributary
- distortions must be perceptually insignificant
- introduce non-linear amplitude modification
- apply non-linear amplitude modification to input samples
- produce different distortions in each tributary
- introduce random phase offsets into host content
- apply random phase offsets independently to each version
- create large difference between versions of host content
- use two or more distinct watermarking technologies
- embed same symbol in same compression unit(s)
- introduce host signal variations at marking stage
- manipulate parameters of compressed domain stream
- introduce small, random amplitude modifications
- use AAC Fill elements to introduce modifications
- change Dynamic Range Control (DRC) in Fill element
- effect masking of watermark symbols
- vary value of Î” associated with each tributary
- change and/or insert bits into DRC portion of bitstream
- add DRC bits to compressed bitstream
- implement embodiments in devices with hardware/software modules
- execute steps of methods using computer-executable instructions
