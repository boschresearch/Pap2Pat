# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF INVENTION

- define digital watermarking

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate digital watermarks
- limitations of conventional marking systems

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce forensic marking method
- embodiment of forensic marking system

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS

- introduce forensic marking in compressed domain
- motivate resiliency against collusion attacks and differential analysis
- describe limitations of prior art (U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,301)
- summarize advantages of present invention over prior art
- illustrate block diagram for embedding forensic marks
- describe preprocessing stage (embedding and compression)
- explain marking module operation (combining tributaries)
- illustrate example embodiment of marking process using binary watermark symbols
- describe compression unit structure
- illustrate watermark embedding procedure
- explain watermark extraction process
- discuss adapting watermarking parameters for AAC compression
- describe avoiding perceptible artifacts in marked content
- illustrate window shapes in AAC compression
- explain switch abandon mechanism
- discuss applying forensic marking to multi-channel content
- generalize forensic marking to other compression techniques

### Differential Analysis Obstruction

- thwart differential analysis attacks
- introduce signal distortions in preprocessing stage
- apply non-linear amplitude modification to host content
- introduce random phase offsets into host content
- use distinct watermarking technologies for embedding symbols
