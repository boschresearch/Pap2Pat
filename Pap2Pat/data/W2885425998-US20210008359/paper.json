    "abstract": "Cell-hydrogel based therapies offer great promise for wound healing. The specific aim of this study was to assess the viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells immobilized in atomized alginate capsules (3.5% (w/v) alginate, d = 225 \u00b5m \u00b1 24.5 \u00b5m) post-extrusion through a three-dimensional (3D) printed methacrylate-based custom hollow microneedle assembly (circular array of 13 conical frusta) fabricated using stereolithography. With a jetting reliability of 80%, the solvent-sterilized device with a root mean square roughness of 158 nm at the extrusion nozzle tip (d = 325 \u03bcm) was operated at a flowrate of 12 mL/min. There was no significant difference between the viability of the sheared and control samples for extrusion times of 2 h (p = 0.14, \u03b1 = 0.05) and 24 h (p = 0.5, \u03b1 = 0.05) post-atomization. Factoring the increase in extrusion yield from 21.2% to 56.4% attributed to hydrogel bioerosion quantifiable by a loss in resilience from 5470 (J/m\u00b3) to 3250 (J/m\u00b3), there was no significant difference in percentage relative payload (p = 0.2628, \u03b1 = 0.05) when extrusion occurred 24 h (12.2 \u00b1 4.9%) when compared to 2 h (9.9 \u00b1 2.8%) post-atomization. Results from this paper highlight the feasibility of encapsulated cell extrusion, specifically protection from shear, through a hollow microneedle assembly reported for the first time in literature.",

                "Due to the growing need for minimally invasive drug delivery systems and the concern of causing pain and anxiety in patients using a conventional hypodermic needle, localized, and generally pain-free delivery systems for therapeutics, such as resorbable microneedle (RMN) patches and hollow microneedle (HMN) arrays have been developed. Since the growth of the microelectronics industry in the 1990\u2032s and the success of microneedle fabrication and transdermal drug administration in 1998, the development of micromolding techniques for dissolving polymeric microneedle fabrication has enhanced the payload of delivery systems, prompting researchers to expand the repertoire of microneedle therapeutic uses [1]. Transdermal drug delivery studies against complex diseases and vaccination include those of Wang, et al. [2] and Ye., Y. et al. [3], who have loaded hyaluronic acid (HA)-based microneedles with anti-PD1 antibody, glucose oxidase (GOx)-encapsulated dextran nanoparticles, and tumor lysate, melanin, respectively, for the transdermal delivery of antitumor immune response-promoting compounds against melanoma; as well as those of Hu, et al. [4], who loaded HA-based microneedles with insulin and GOx-encapsulated polymeric vesicles, and Lahiji, et al. [5], who developed dissolving microneedles encapsulated with Exendin-4 hormone, against types I and II diabetes. A more comprehensive list of diseases that are treated and therapeutic compounds delivered using MN technology is presented in Table S1 [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16].",
                "Across multiple physiological time scales associated with wound type and wound healing [17] the use of MNs has been investigated in the following areas: (a) antimicrobial wound treatment [18,19,20]; (b) proliferation of endothelial cells [21,22]; (c) scar repair [22,23]; and, (d) treatment of chronic wounds and burns [24,25]. Related cutting edge applications of MNs include biointerfacing [26], wound detection [27], and smart bandages under development combining detection and delivery [28].",
                "Micromolding is the most widely manufacturing method used [12,29]. Other methods include direct photolithography [30], drawing lithography [31], solvent casting [32], mold-based etching [33], and lithography [34], which are all variants that are developed based on the micromolding method of polydimethylsiloxane (PMDS) polymer casting. Numerous biofabrication methods have been devised for RMNs and HMNs a subset of which will be elaborated upon below and presented in Table S2. Ruggiero, et al. [35] have adapted an electro-drawing technique of fabrication, by designing a pattern distribution of integrated metallic micro-heaters that applies an electrohydrodynamic (EHP) force onto polymer solution sessile drops for microneedle shaping. Their setup induces the generation of a uniform electric field, allowing for homogeneous EHP deformation of the drops and careful formation into tapered poly-lactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) RMNs. Johnson, et al. [36] have used an additive manufacturing (AM) method, Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP), to three-dimensional (3D) print dissolving microneedle structures from a computer aided design (CAD) file. The CLIP method they have adapted photopolymerizes the MNs by selectively targeting and solidifying photoreactive resin with ultra-violet (UV) light on a rising platform [36]. In addition, Huh, et al. [37] adapted a Droplet-borne air blowing (DAB) method by first dispensing a polymer drug mixture as a droplet, then contacting, drawing, air-drying, and separating the mixture to form microneedle structures, and similarly, Kim, et al. [38] designed a \u201cDipping\u201d method to form RMNs in which polymer-coated pillar tips are first coated in a drug of interest, dipped in drug-unmixed solution, then lifted, air-dried, and separated to form microneedle tips. Most recently, Luzuriaga, et al. [39] have adapted a fused deposition modeling (FDM\u2122) based printing method to fabricate RMN structures; this AM method circumvents the need for a clean-room, master template, or mold, which are mandatory for previously used micromolding and lithography-based techniques for fabrication [40,41], and introduces sustainability into microneedle array manufacturing.",
                "Although 3D printing for MNs was first investigated in 2007 by Ovsianikov et al. [42] while using a lithography-based multiphoton polymerization printing method, the ability to print biocompatible and biodegradable materials from conventional 3D printing methods, such as stereolithography (SLA), FDM\u2122, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), CLIP, and Digital Light Processing (DLP) [43,44,45] has been the focus of numerous studies presented in Table S3. The biofabrication methods have been classified under the AM processes outlined in ISO/ASTM 52900:2015 [46]. SLS and primarily SLA 3D printing have been of interest due to their high resolution and their ability to fabricate solid features smaller than 100 \u03bcm, which are ideal for microneedle parameters. However, their disadvantage is that untreated photopolymers used in commercial 3D printers have a lack of biocompatibility and can therefore be toxic for living cell compounds [47,48,49,50]. Therefore, material selection in SLA and SLS 3D printing of MN arrays is key as successfully reported in the following studies: Kang, et al. [51] and Lu, et al. [52] have successfully printed MN arrays pre-loaded with drugs using SLA 3D printing. While, the former study encompassed biofabrication of poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) based MN structures embedded in bovine serum albumin, the latter study was based on printing results of poly (propylene fumarate)/diethyl fumarate (PFF) MN arrays that are loaded with dacarbazine drug. In addition to polymers, Gieseke, et al. [53] have SLS-3D printed stainless steel 316l alloy. As previously mentioned, FDM\u2122, followed by etching post-printing used for RMN fabrication [39], its main limitation being the lower resolution when compared to other printing methods, such as SLA and SLS in the absence of post-processing. Other studies, such as Johnson, et al.\u2019s [36] and Miller, et al.\u2019s [54], have also investigated MN fabrication using CLIP and DLP 3D printing methods, respectively, to print biocompatible acrylate-based photopolymer materials, such as Trimethylolpropane Triacrylate and eShell 200 photosensitive acrylate-based biocompatible polymer resin by EnvisionTEC, Inc. (Dearborn, MI, USA).",
                "Due to the breadth of applications, and design considerations for optimal delivery and minimal patient pain, numerous geometries, and array dimensions of MNs have been investigated a subset of which will be elaborated upon. A synopsis is presented in Table S4, with reference to geometries in MN studies presented in Tables S1\u2013S3. MN structures range over the following spatial configurations: Pointed tip with triangular slope [54], conical shape [2,4,14,55,56], cylindrical shape [57], cylindrical body and pointed head [45,52,58], tip-beveled triangular cylinder shape [34], tip-beveled cylinder shape [59,60], pyramidal shape [8,12,61], and tetrahedron-shaped [62]. Based on the studies, these different microneedle shapes and geometries have been shown to breach the stratum corneum layer of human and porcine skin.",
                "Gupta, et al. studied microneedle infusion pressure and pain in human patients while using saline and hollow glass microneedles of variable insertion depth [63]. According to their study, pain is minimized with maximal microneedle insertion depth of 750 \u03bcm, delivered medium saline volume of 1 mL, and infusion flow rate 0.3 mL/min. Furthermore, pressures of approximately 500, 1000, and 2000 mmHg were optimal for minimized pain for microneedle insertion depths of 500 and 700 \u03bcm. In addition, microneedle tip geometry was investigated in relation to pain; applying microneedles of up to about 700 \u03bcm in length, and up to 55 degrees pitch to the skin [64], and using either an array of 10 \u00d7 750 \u03bcm tall, 75 \u03bcm thick, 200 \u03bcm wide or 50 \u00d7 500 \u03bcm tall, 75 \u03bcm thick, 200 \u03bcm wide microneedles [65] were reported to generally cause minimal pain (no pain or light pain) in patients.",
                "Captured across multiple studies are the Mesenchymal Stem Cells demonstrated effects on cutaneous wound healing and skin regeneration in vitro and in vivo models, by accelerating wound closure, enhancing re-epithelialization, increasing angiogenesis, promoting granulation tissue formation, modulating inflammation, and regulating extracellular matrix remodeling [66,67,68,69,70,71,72]. There are currently 142 registered human clinical trials on stem cells and wound healing worldwide [73]. The major obstacle to clinical translation is stem cell immunogenicity and their reduced survival in vivo [74,75,76,77]. To this effect, polymeric stem cell entrapment strategies, including scaffold surface modifications for transdermal delivery have been devised and tested in preclinical animal wound models [78]. Scaffolding materials include natural, synthetic, and composite polymers and hydrogels with tunable micro/macroporosities, stiffness and bioerosion rates [79,80,81] Amongst nanoporous immuno-protective biomimetic hydrogels, the encapsulation of cells in alginate a linear unbranched polysaccharide containing \u03b2-d-mannuronic acid (M) and \u03b1-l-guluronic acid (G) residues has been widely applied in preclinical models of drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue regeneration as early as the 1960s [82,83,84,85,86,87].",
                "In a recent British human pilot study to test the safety and efficacy of microneedles for cell delivery ex vivo in patients with vitiligo, melanocyte, keratinocyte, and mixed epidermal cell suspensions were successfully extruded through various types of hollow silicon microneedles ranging from 75\u2013100 \u03bcm in bore size and 400\u2013700 \u03bcm in depth. All cell types investigated maintained their distinctive phenotype after extrusion through microneedles and at all concentrations after 72 h of testing [88,89].",
                "Combining the advantages of MN-based delivery systems, 3D microenvironments for cell survival and the presence of an immuno-isolation barrier, a custom 3D-printed hollow MN device has been designed to extrude alginate microcapsules into which epithelial cells have been seeded. Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2/ATCC HB-8065), which is a shear sensitive cell line, has been chosen to simulate the behavior of the cocktail of epithelial cells [90,91,92]. To date, there is no study capturing the preclinical biomaterials characterization of HMNs fabricated using stereolithography through which encapsulated mammalian cells have been sheared. Therefore, the specific aim of this paper is to determine whether there is a difference in viability between the extruded encapsulated cells as compared to non-extruded controls."

                "There is an 18.75% difference between the specified nozzle (tip) radius (rspecified = d/2 =200 \u03bcm) and the dimension of the printed part (rprinted = 162.5 \u03bcm) measured by optical microscopy. A well-documented issue of 3D printing is the resulting dimensional accuracy of a printed part. In particular, for printing methods involving layer-by-layer material solidification, such as SLA 3D printing, material shrinkage is induced by the liquid to solid phase change during the building and post-curing procedures [97]. Previously, Finite Element Analysis studies and empirical models have been developed to predict resulting printed shapes and to optimize process parameters, respectively [98], but fell short in accurate prediction due to the high complexity of the model. Although it was determined that UV-light curing provides more uniform shrinkage than thermal post-curing [99], and several studies involving DLP and SLA light-based additive manufacturing of photo-resin material observe such post-print shrinking [100,101,102], modeling, and prediction studies focusing on printed resin shrinkage have only been investigated to a certain extent [98,102]. Among such studies, Huang, et al. have developed a method to model shape volumetric shrinkage for accuracy control in additive manufacturing by plotting shrinkage under polar coordinate representation, and validated the results with SLA-derived, 3D printed SI500 photoresin by EnvisionTEC, Inc. (Dearborn, MI, USA). [98]. Alternatively, experimental volumetric shrinkage can be calculated by comparing resin density before and after it is cured. For example, Huang, et al. developed a photosensitive resin for SLA 3D printing, and measured a shrinking factor of 2.00% post-curing [103]. However, the value is highly variable among SLA printable photosensitive resins, as scan pitch and laser power of the specific 3D printer affects the shrinkage [102]. In the present study, the combined contribution of curing and alcohol washes led to a shrunk nozzle diameter of 325 \u00b5m, closer to the maximum 300 \u03bcm upper range as proposed in literature and documented to ease patient pain [63,64,65]. Future process optimization efforts will include reducing the specified nozzle diameter (d) and varying the aspect ratio of the frustum in order to achieve a value that is closer to the physical specifications for pain management stated above. Specimens will be subjected to the Izod pendulum impact test to assess the risk of using higher impact ratios [104].",
                "Changing the aspect ratio will, in turn, enable flowrate optimization for therapeutic administration. In this study, the operating flowrate of 12 mL/min associated with reliable jetting of the bolus microcapsule suspension exceeded 40 times the therapeutic value of 0.3 mL/min [63]. Microcapsule administration at lower flowrates led to nozzle blockage induced by aggregation. Colloidal stability can be inferred by surface coating of microcapsules with a polyelectrolyte (modifying the surface charge) and changing the ionic strength of the media [105]. Since media composition is restricted by physiological requirements, physical adsorption of the alginate microcapsules by chitosan or poly-l-lysine routinely used in regenerative medicine is the only tunable variable [106]. A consequence of increased distance between capsules due to electrostatic repulsion may have a lower particle density, resulting in decreased payload. This drawback could be overcome by fabricating smaller alginate structures while using well established methodologies [107]. Another advantage of mitigating aggregation is the elimination of air use for pushing the fluid through the biodevice reservoir, which was proposed as a loading mechanism (Section 2.2.3) to prevent nozzle blockage. Following multifactorial optimization of part design, colloidal stability, and microcapsule miniaturization, with injection using a syringe pump into pig skin, the standard ex vivo model for wound healing will be investigated [108].",
                "The exact composition of the Clear FLGPCL02\u00ae methacrylate-based photoresin is proprietary. Distinguishable by clarity, the following is a non-exhaustive list of medical grade resins: dimethacrylate (DMA) [109], polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), [110] and Methyl methacrylate/acrylonitrile/butadiene styrene (MABS) [111]. Specifically, linked to SLA are methacrylate-based proprietary photoresins [56,57,112] and acrylic-based photoresins [43,54,55]. While methacrylate-based monomers used in bone cements [113], dental fillings are considered to be biocompatible [114], their long-term implantation has been associated with irritancy and cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity of meth (acrylates) stems from two distinct reactions [115,116]. The first one is the Michael addition, the nucleophilic addition of protein across the double bond of the acrylate function. The second one is the hydrolysis of the ester linkages, of uncured monomer or cured polymer catalyzed by carboxylesterase into carboxylic (acid)s and small molecule alcohols as principal degradation products. While, monomer degradation leads to a local decrease in pH polymer degradation, which leads to inflammation. Apart from bioerosion-related material cytotoxicity, heating of methacrylate-based thermoplastics such as laser cutting processes has been linked to ultrafine particle (UFP) generation [117]. UFP cytotoxicity has been extensively studied for the most commonly used materials in desktop 3D printers Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). UFPs are considered a serious health concern to human health because they deposit in the pulmonary and alveolar regions of the lung [47,118]. Macdonald, et al. used the zebrafish Field Effect Transistor test to investigate the biocompatibility of photopolymers that are used in 3D printers. Leaching of uncured monomers from 3D printed parts was assessed by washing the parts within a large volume of solvents, namely ethanol (70% (v/v) and 99% (v/v)) and IPA (99% (v/v)) under agitation, with 99% ethanol yielding the highest biocompatibility results [47]. Nevertheless, it was found that the photopolymers were highly toxic due to the presence of UFP, nano-sized particles less than 100 nm in diameter, known to be released from ABS materials. PMMA biocompatibility has been proven by results of a recent 72 h cytotoxicity assessment of samples, as determined through growth monitoring, adherence, and morphology of L-929 cells in which a similar ethanol-based protocol was used for sterilization [119]. However, the above-mentioned samples were not photopolymerized, unlike the custom-printed SLA-fabricated piece in the current study. Sources for the hypothetical generation of UFPs in the current biofabrication process would be the post-curing stages and sterilization where the UFPs could be concentrated on the surface. Multiple DI rinses post-solvent sterilization were implemented to reduce the chance of UFP particle seeding. Due to the presence of the immuno-isolation membrane, and the documented molecular weight cutoff of the cross-linked alginate (MWCO) of 68 kDa, equivalent to a Stokes\u2019 radius of 3 nm [120], in the possible event that UFPs were present on the surface of the biodevice, the viability results would not be affected. However, the risk of particulate introduction upon insertion into the patients\u2019 skin needs to be investigated in future studies.",
                "While the preliminary qualitative results of the short term screening (24 h) cytotoxicity presented in Figure 6, suggested an equivalency between U87 cell line proliferation on TCPS and the custom 3D printed Clear FLGPCL02\u00ae photoresin, future studies will encompass an IC50 determination (half maximal inhibitory concentration of a substance) [94,121] using the WST-8 assay. Specifically, the following samples that were collected through sequential stages of the study incubated in DMEM will be diluted to multiple concentrations in order to construct the dose-dependent viability curve: (a) post-cured pre-assembled prototype; (b) assembled HMNs post-sterilization; and, (c) post-extruded microcapsules. PMMA surfaces are characterized by a critical surface tension of 37.5 dyn/cm [122] positioned at the lower level threshold for biofouling [123]. Surface roughness measurements that are related to bacterial adhesion research in PMMA-based implants range from 40 nm [124] to 200 nm [125] with a positive correlation between roughness and adhesion. Meanwhile, the newer bioactive bone cements are designed to be porous [126,127]. There is an overlap between the measured RMS range for the custom-printed methacrylate-based slabs (30\u2013158 nm) and the reported biocompatible range (40\u2013200 nm). The HMN parts in the present study were not designed to be porous. Further AFM experimentation is needed to distinguish surface roughness from random pore morphology. In addition, a Zisman plot will be constructed to determine the critical surface tension of the proprietary photoresin.",
                "Entrapment of mammalian cells in alginate-based structures reported using various metrics depend on biofabrication methods, namely electrospraying, microfludic fabrication, in-situ polymerization, and atomization [82,128,129,130]. Use of sodium citrate for capsule core liquefaction by incubating the beads in 0.055 M sodium citrate solution (a Ca2+ chelator) is a standard method for cell recovery [131,132,133,134]. Because of the smaller extrusion volumes from the biodevice, the hydrogel membrane was not subjected to chelation and the viability measurements were based solely on the WST-8 assay dye diffusion through the alginate membrane. Since the Stokes\u2019 radius of the dye is an order of magnitude smaller than the reported 70 kDa MWCO of the membrane [120], diffusion should not theoretically be rate-limiting. Shown in Figure 8a\u2013d is the random positioning of the entrapped HepG2 cells. Due to the stagnant dye layer at the boundary of the membrane, the reaction for the cells in the middle of the capsule may have been diffusion-limited. Incubation times that are higher than 2 h recommended by the manufacturer overcame this limitation, however the accuracy of the assay was compromised by the cross-reactivity of the media. This source of error in viability determination is reflected in the norm of the standard deviations of background-subtracted absorbances shown in Figure 9a, amounting to as high as a third of the average values. There was no significant viability loss as a result of extrusion for day 1 (Set 1) and day 2 (Set 2). However, there was significant loss of viability post 24 h incubation independent of the delay between microencapsulation and extrusion. Spheroid formation that was detected after a day (Figure 8b,d) and diffusion limited transport of oxygen and nutrients due to a stagnant microenvironment may have been a root cause for this decline in viability. These hypotheses will be tested in future long-term studies, using alternate methods of viability detection, namely the live/dead fluorescence-based assays [131,134,135,136]. Furthermore, the WST-8 assay will be revisited after cell recovery by chelation of the cross-linked membrane. Once the cells are free, they may be subjected to proliferation and differentiation protocols to assess the effect of shear through the biodevice. With less noise in viability measurements, initial cell number optimization for delaying the formation of spheroids, as well as the suitability of sterilization while using the standard methods such ethylene oxide and \u03b3-radiation will also be assessed.",
                "Bulk and surface erosion of cross-linked alginate structures occurs in physiological media as a result of chelation and subsequent swelling [137,138]. The major constituent of FBS is bovine serum albumin [139], with a MW of 68 kDa, known to be a cutoff for cross-linked alginate membranes [120]. At constant temperature, equilibrium swelling in media is a balance between osmotic, electrostatic, and elastic forces that are holding the cross-links together [140,141]. No significant swelling was detected as a result of incubation as presented in Figure 8a,b, suggesting that either the concentration of albumin was not high enough to cause an osmotic effect after 24 h, or, the rate of chelation was insignificant for the 3.5% (w/v) alginate membrane.",
                "It could be hypothesized that the bioerosion-driven measured a loss of resilience illustrated in Figure 7 after 24 h of incubation in media was the driving force behind the higher extrusion yield (Ex = 54.6%). For stiffer (E = 90 kPa) microcapsules that were incubated for 2 h in media (Set 1), the HMN array acted as a strict and random filter, as illustrated by the preponderance of satellites in Figure 8c and the extrusion yield of 21.2%. Meanwhile, for more flexible microcapsules (Set 2, E = 54 kPa) that are jetted through the HMNs change in size distribution, as previously stated, was not statistically significant (p = 0.18, \u03b1 = 0.05). Elasticity of alginate microcapsules is a function of alginate composition (i.e., M/G ratio, presence of collagen), cross-linking time, matrix porosity and strain rate [134,142,143]. Furthermore, the Young\u2019s modulus is inversely correlated to the size of the microspherical constructs assuming that adhesive contact exists between individual particles [144,145]. To that effect, the relative elasticity norms between macrocapsules and microcapsules are translatable, suggesting that it was easier to extrude softer capsules. Across the above-mentioned multifactorial studies the average Young\u2019s modulus for 3 mm alginate beads ranged between 25\u201335 kPa as compared to 90 kPa obtained in the current study. Sources of discrepancy could be the higher alginate concentration of 3.5% (w/v), a higher cross-linking time of 20 min, a difference in strain rates and load cell ratings. Future parallel macro and micro indentation studies in physiological media should be conducted in DMEM in order to assess the validity of this hypothesis.",
                "No direct comparisons can be drawn between the present study and the recent delivery of epidermal cells through silicon HMNs [88,89] due to the lack of an immuno-isolation membrane and the clinical nature of the latter research."

                "In this bench scale study a custom 3D printed HMN biodevice comprised of a reservoir chamber and an array of conical microneedle (13 conical frusta, d = 400 \u03bcm, D = 1000 \u03bcm, H = 600 \u03bcm) was fabricated using the sustainable low cost method of SLA. The Null hypothesis was accepted since the viability of extruded encapsulated HepG2 cells through the solvent-sterilized device was statistically equivalent to that of non-extruded capsules at the 95% confidence interval. With a RMS value of 158 nm being determined by AFM, the nozzle tip roughness was comparable to PMMA-based dental implants that are associated with cell adhesion. Preliminary qualitative screening cytotoxicity tests that are based on U87 cell adhesion indicated equivalency between the photoresin and TCPS in terms of biocompatibility, the validity of which should be confirmed using dose-dependent quantitative IC50 studies.",
                "This microneedle platform may be customized for delivery of a broad variety of tunable scaffold properties and it should not be limited to alginate. Despite a shrinkage rate of 18.75%, the dimension of the nozzle tip measured to be 325 \u03bcm exceeded the geometric specification of <300 \u03bcm associated with patient pain minimization [63,64,65]. Using SLA and the proprietary methacrylate-based Formlabs Clear photoresin\u00ae, the rate limiting factor will be the improvement of printing resolution, which in turn governs flow optimization and painless administration. In the interim, the possibility of extrusion of cells protected by an immune-isolation membrane through other existing HMNs, expandable into applications of wound healing therapies pivoting on hydrogel cell interactions will be explored."
