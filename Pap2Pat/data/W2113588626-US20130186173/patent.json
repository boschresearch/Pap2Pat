    "abstract": "A device and method for simulating a blast shock wave of the type produced by explosive devices such as bombs. A pneumatic charge releases a blast shock wave along a conduit which terminates in a first outlet that communicates with the atmosphere and a second outlet that is sealed to a specimen chamber. The first outlet has a quick release valve that prevents venting of the pneumatic charge to the atmosphere until the pressure at the valve reaches a predetermined level that opens the valve. The pneumatic charge therefore initially flows through the second outlet to direct the blast into the specimen chamber, until subsequent opening of the quick release valve redirects the gas flow out of the first outlet and rapidly reduces pressure in the chamber. The blast wave closely simulates the Friedlander curve, and its effects are viewed during instead of only after the blast is completed.",

                        "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major public health problem. Since 2001, over 150,000 US military personnel have been diagnosed with a mild form of TBI, often after exposure to an explosive blast (bTBI), with a spectrum of neurological and psychological deficits.",
                        "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) separates blast injury into four phases. The primary injury phase is the response of brain tissue to the blast wave from an intense over-pressurization impulse of the blast. A secondary injury phase results from shrapnel penetration. Tertiary injury is caused by head contact/acceleration forces as the body is moved by the forced air flow from the blast. A quaternary injury phase is any injury not included in the first three phases, such as hemorrhagic shock or chemical/thermal burn injury.",
                        "The primary injury phase, the direct result of the shockwave generated by an explosion, is the least understood. The blast shock wave (BSW) of primary bTBI is a transient, solitary supersonic pressure wave with a rapid (sub-msec) increase in pressure (i.e. compression) followed by a more slowly developing (msec) rarefraction phase of low pressure (i.e. tension). In the majority of bTBI, the peak pressure is low; exposure to blasts estimated to create 10 atm peak pressure in the skull for a few milliseconds can result in death for unprotected persons. Although dynamic compression, tension, and shear stress have all been proposed to explain primary bTBI, the identity of the mechanical forces involved, the tissue-force interaction(s) and the cellular damage properties remain unresolved. A barotrauma chamber is commonly used to study the effect of pressure on biological tissue, such as CNS tissue. Shepard et al., J. Surg. Res. 51:417-424 (1991). The barotrauma chamber applies pressure evenly to all cells or tissue components in the chamber. The pressure wave in a barotrauma chamber can be produced by either hydrostatic or fluid percussion mechanisms.",
                        "Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has also been used to generate high-amplitude, transient pressure pulses to study shock-wave induced tissue damage. For example, Howard and Sturtevant used ESWL in vitro on thin membranes immersed in tissue-mimicking fluids to study the mechanism of pulsed pressure tissue damage. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 23:1107-1122 (1997). This device permitted the study of pressure-induced compression and lateral extension that induced shear damage to structures such as the plasma membrane, organelles and intracellular membranes.",
                        "Shock tubes have also been used to expose cells or even entire bodies to simulated blasts to study how they respond to fast and extreme changes in pressure, as in Arun et al., Neuroreport 22:379-384 (2011). A compression-driven shock tube was used to simulate blast effects and subsequently study neuropathological changes in Long et al., J. Neurotrauma 26:827-840 (2009). The blast overpressure was generated by introducing pressurized gas into the shock tube until a Mylar membrane ruptured at a preselected pressure."

                        "Animal studies on the effects of shockwave in vivo are useful for studying aspects of cellular damage mechanisms, but lack the capability for real-time monitoring of cellular behavior during and immediately after the blast, and are unable to differentiate the proposed direct effects of the transient pressure pulse from the secondary effects of the shear stresses produced by that pressure transient. In vitro models of primary blast injury are likewise limited by an absence of real-time, high spatial and temporal detection of cellular responses during, immediately after, and long after the blast, and they do not differentiate shear from pressure effects.",
                        "Some of these drawbacks are overcome by the device disclosed herein which simulates an explosive blast shock wave (BSW). The device includes a source of compressed gas and a primary conduit for conveying gas from the source of compressed gas along a primary conduit having a primary axis of gas flow. The primary conduit terminates in a release valve that opens when gas pressure at the release valve reaches a predetermined pressure. A secondary conduit extends at an angle (not parallel) to the primary conduit axis of gas flow and the secondary conduit terminates in an outlet orifice that directs gas from the primary conduit toward a target region such as a microscope stage. The secondary conduit is joined to the primary conduit between the source of compressed gas and the quick release valve.",
                        "A trigger releases the compressed gas into the primary conduit toward the release valve to generate a simulated blast shock wave flow of gas that is blocked by the release valve and therefore flows at an angle through the secondary conduit and the outlet orifice toward the target. The pressure amplitude of the blast shock wave increases until the release valve in the primary conduit opens and allows the gas to flow along the longitudinal axis of the primary conduit over the opening to the secondary conduit. The flow of the blast shock wave past the secondary conduit rapidly reduces the pressure within the secondary conduit and at the outlet orifice to mimic the rapid blast shock wave pressure reduction of an actual explosion. In some embodiments, the flow of gas over the secondary outlet generates negative pressure at the outlet orifice. In some embodiments the secondary conduit extends substantially perpendicular to the primary axis of gas flow through the primary conduit to maximize this effect.",
                        "In some embodiments a specimen platform is fixed adjacent the outlet orifice in the flow path of the blast shock wave as the shock wave emerges from the outlet orifice of the secondary conduit. An imaging device is provided to capture images of the specimen and determine its response before, during and after the blast shock wave. For example, the imaging device may include a video camera and/or a microscope. In other embodiments the specimen is contained in a transparent chamber on a transparent platform and the microscope is positioned to view the specimen from below the platform. In specific embodiments, the chamber is the well of a multiple-well plate that is securely fixed to a microscope stage. Different depths or volumes of liquid in the chamber expose the specimen to varying levels of shear stress, so that the effects of different levels of shear stress on the biological specimen can be measured.",
                        "The quick release valve can take many forms, such as a plug or other occlusion member that is ejected from the primary conduit when pressure at the outlet orifice reaches a predetermined maximum value that approximates the maximum pressure of an explosive blast. A coupling may be provided to connect the secondary conduit to the chamber in which the specimen is contained so that the simulated blast shock wave is directed substantially only into the chamber that contains the sample. In one embodiment, mating threads on the secondary conduit and in the chamber couple them to one another in a substantially sealed relationship to direct the blast shock wave substantially only into the specimen chamber until the quick release valve opens.",
                        "In other embodiments, the specimen platform is movable to position a plurality of different specimens over the imaging device, such as the objective lens of a microscope. A multiple-well plate can be placed on the specimen platform and tissue samples or cellular preparations can be placed in different wells on the plate. The device is particularly adapted for studying nerve cells in the wells of the plates that are exposed to the blast shock wave.",
                        "The disclosed device is capable of imaging and/or analyzing images of target tissue over time as blast injury occurs, instead of being limited to the assessing end point damage after a simulated blast is finished. For example, the device is capable of viewing cellular or tissue responses of a biological specimen to a blast shock wave as the shock wave progresses, instead of being limited to an assessment of the effects after the simulated blast is completed. Although a variety of tissues and cells can be studied using this device, the disclosed embodiment is described with reference to the analysis of the response of cultured nerve cells to the blast wave. The disclosed device is also capable of substantially reproducing the Friedlander curve blast shock wave pressure profile to better model the effects of a blast on biological specimens."

                        "Blast shock wave: a pulse of pressurized gas that is produced by an explosion of an explosive device. The pulse can either be produced by an explosion of an actual explosive device, or it can be simulated. The pulse profile of the blast shock wave is generally described by the Friedlander curve.",
                        "Friedlander curve: Most conventional high explosives release, in a relatively short amount of time, a large quantity of energy through expansion of the gaseous detonation products. This energy release results in an overpressure wave that travels through the air at a velocity greater than the speed of sound. As the blast wave propagates away from the center of the explosion, its energy spreads through an increasing volume of air and the blast magnitude decreases rapidly. The passage of the blast wave through a particular position away from the detonation can be characterized as a simple or a complex blast wave. A simple blastwave pressure disturbance resulting from an ideal explosion in free field has the shape of a Friedlander curve. Ideal explosions are defined as being produced by uncased bare charges, made with a conventional explosive (e.g. TNT, C4, RDX) with either aspherical or a hemispherical geometry. In the Friedlander curve, the pressure is comprised of a positive phase and a relatively long negative pressure phase as shown in FIG. 5.",

                        "T-outlet: A conduit that is generally T-shaped and has two generally collinear arms and a substantially perpendicular leg, wherein each of the arms and leg terminate in an outlet. A particular example of a T-outlet is a T-connector.",
                        "Trigger: a device to release gas from a pressurized source of compressed of gas; the trigger can be mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, or any other combination or type of device that initiates the release. The trigger can be programmed to release the gas at varying rates and maximum amplitudes. The device disclosed herein is adapted to simulate a blast shock wave, such as the type produced by a battlefield explosive device, such as an improvised explosive device (IED). The blast shock wave produced by the device is capable, for example, of generating a simulated blast shock wave at a biological target (for example in a specimen chamber) of at least 4 or 6 atmospheres above the starting pressure (ambient) in less than one second. In some embodiments, the device produced a blast shock wave in the specimen chamber of 4-15 atm above ambient pressure, for example 6-14 atm above ambient pressure, in less than 0.5 or 0.25 second, or 0.1 second with a rapid decrease in pressure in the specimen chamber to the ambient or below ambient pressure. In illustrated examples, the increase of the pressure in the specimen chamber to its maximum amplitude and then the decrease to ambient or below ambient pressure occurs in less than about 0.5 seconds. FIG. 5 illustrates examples of blast waves generated by the illustrated device in which the total blast duration from initiation to sub-ambient pressure is less than 1 second, for example less than 0.5 second.",
                        "In disclosed embodiments, the device is also capable of real-time observation of in vitro responses of biological tissue to the blast shock wave, including microscopic observation and analysis of cellular preparations, such as cultured cells. Examples of nerve tissue that can be studied are tissue of the central nervous system (CNS) which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which includes nerve fibers, aggregates of nerve cells, glia and ganglia. Suitable specimens for study with the device disclosed herein include any type of nerve tissue, either a cellular preparation in cell medium or an intact tissue specimen such as a tissue section of brain. Various types of cells that can be cultured, and media and methods for suspending and/or culturing such cells, are described in Banker and Gosslin, Culturing Nerve Cells, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience (1998).",

Tissue from any organ may similarly be used, such as tissue from the brain, kidney, heart, liver, lung, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, skin, ovary, testes, or muscle. Isolated cells from these tissues may also be used, for example brain cells.",
                        "In a particularly disclosed embodiment, FIG. 1A shows a device 10 for simulating an explosive blast shock wave (BSW). Device 10 includes a source of compressed gas in the form of a canister 12 connected to an air gun 14, such as an Airforce Model R9901 pre-charged pneumatic air rifle. The gas in the canister is a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2 pressurized to 1500 psi. The commercially available air gun 14 was modified to replace the inner gun barrel with a chromium-molybdenum steel tube 15 that extends beyond the barrel and terminates at its free end in a quick connect valve member 17 (FIG. 1B) that connects a flexible high pressure hose 16 (capable of withstanding pressure up to 5000 psi) to a second quick connect valve member 18. A further modification was to modify the hammer and spring mechanism that controls the hammer trigger to instead provide a U-bracket 20 on top of air gun 14 with a trigger 22 mounted inside bracket 20. Trigger 22 releases the blast of pneumatic air released from canister 12 to simulate blast shock waves. The force, duration or amplitude of the pressure wave can be varied, for example, by increasing or decreasing the pressure in the canister or changing the diameter of the outlet valve, the strength of the spring in the gun, tension on the spring, or the weight of the hammer in the trigger.",
                        "The quick connect valve member 18 is similar to valve member 17, hence only valve member 18 is described in detail (FIG. 1B). Valve member 18 includes a female member that connects to the male member 24 of the quick connect valve to efficiently connect and disconnect members 18 and 24. An axially displaceable collar on member 18 is capable of rapidly disengaging members 18, 24. Male member 24 is threadably engaged to a coupling 26 having internal threads engaged to external threads on male member 2. An opposing end of coupling 26 is externally threaded to mate with internal threads of stainless steel T-connector 28 available from Mcmaster.com. The T-connector 28 has internally threaded proximal arm 28a and internally threaded distal arm 28b, and an externally threaded leg 30 that is angled at a non-parallel angle from the arms of T-connector 28, for example at an oblique or substantially perpendicular angle (80-100 degrees) to a linear axis through the arms of the T-connector 28. The open bottom end of leg 30 forms an outlet orifice 34 through which a blast shock wave from device 10 is emitted during use. Leg 30 may be connected to a specimen well as subsequently described to provide a sealed chamber so that as pressure increases in the specimen well the pressure in the primary conduit also increases.",
                        "A quick release valve 32 in arm 28B of T-connector 28 provides a mechanism for venting pressure from the T-connector when a predetermined pressure wave amplitude is reached at valve 32. The valve 32 includes an occlusion member, such as a plastic filter tip taken from a 1250 \u03bcl pipette tip (Thermo Scientific). The filter tip has a smooth surface that is not externally threaded, but the occlusion member is made of a material that deforms as it is rotated into internally threaded arm 28b. The filter tip is inserted into the internally threaded arm 28b of T-connector 28 (FIGS. 1B, 3A, 3B and 4) rotates a preselected number of turns (\u2159 to 1\u00bc turns). The number of rotations of the plug into the threads correlates with varying peak overpressure amplitudes, and the plug therefore provides reproducible overpressures to simulate blasts of different intensities. The peak overpressure was varied reproducibly from 6-15 atm above ambient pressure using the specified number of turns so that the plug would be displaced at a predetermined pressure inside T-connector 28. The plug provides a simple quick release valve to achieve a more rapid pressure release as compared to other fixed pressure release valves with longer rise times. In the illustrated embodiment, \u2159 rotation provided 6 atm of release pressure, \u2153 rotation provided 11 atm, and 1\u00bc turn provided 14 atm maximum pressure before the plug was ejected at the preselected peak overpressure.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1A, tube 15, valve 17, hose 16, valve 18/24, coupling 26 and the arms 28a, 28b of T-connector 28 provide an unobstructed primary conduit for conveying gas from canister 12 along a substantially linear primary conduit axis 36 of gas flow that terminates at arm 28b of T-connector 28. FIG. 4 illustrates a simplified schematic view of the primary conduit illustrating the linear primary conduit axis 36 of gas flow as it moves from air gun 14 to the occlusion of quick release valve 32 which is capable of stopping the flow of gas until the gas pressure at valve 32 reaches the predetermined pressure. Although the illustrated embodiment shows a flow along a linear primary conduit axis, the axis can be curved or otherwise non-linear. Leg 30 provides a separate secondary conduit that communicates with the primary conduit such that gas from the primary conduit can flow freely without obstructions into the secondary conduit.",
                        "When air gun trigger 22 is activated, device 10 releases a burst of pressurized gas from canister 12 and directs it through the primary conduit along primary conduit axis 36. As the pressurized gas is released, the quick release valve on the T-connector traps gas to redirect a portion of the gas flow away from the primary conduit axis, for example at an angle through the secondary conduit (leg 30 and outlet orifice 34) downwardly toward a sealed specimen well, so that a rapid increase in pressure occurs within the well that simulates a blast pressure wave. Pressure in the primary conduit also continues to increase, and when the pressure in the primary conduit exceeds the limit of the quick release valve the plug is ejected, allowing the gas to escape to the atmosphere through leg 28b, which results in a rapid decay of overpressure as the accumulated pressure is released. The rapid gas flow through the narrow horizontal portion of the T-connector creates a drop in pressure at the outlet orifice 34 of leg 30 to below ambient levels using the Venturi effect. The rapid flow of gas through the primary conduit over the open secondary conduit and out the open end of the primary conduit into the atmosphere causes a rapid decrease in pressure in the sealed well to simulate in the well the rapid pressure decrease a target (such as a person) experiences as a blast shock wave passes the target.",
                        "Device 10 is adapted for use in real time monitoring and microscopic evaluation of tissue, for example cellular tissue such as cultured cells, for example cultured nerve cells. Alternatively, intact tissue sections can be used. As shown in FIGS. 1A, 2 and 4, device 10 includes a stationary support beam 40 on which air gun 14 is mounted to avoid recoil of the air gun during pneumatic discharge. Support beam 40 is positioned adjacent microscope carriage 42 having a solid top wall 44 on which is schematically shown a light source 46 that uses an arm to illuminates the interior of carriage 42. Within carriage 44 is a movable motorized stage 48 that moves in a plane parallel to wall 44. Motorized stage 48 has a central aperture 50 (FIG. 4) positioned above a real time imaging apparatus 52. In the disclosed embodiment, real time imaging apparatus 52 is a Ti wide-field inverted microscope for data acquisition and experimental control. FIG. 1A illustrates a 20\u00d7 air objective (NA 0.75) 54 for imaging the specimen by positioning objective 54 below aperture 50 in motorized stage 48. The imaging device is capable of imaging the view through the microscope, transmitting the image to a viewer, and/or recording the image. Direct visualization of the biological specimen is also possible by viewing the target through eyepieces 60 of the microscope.",
                        "The fluorescence indicator Fluo-4 (Invitrogen) was used to monitor intracellular calcium. Fluo-4 was excited using 480 nm light (Chroma HQ 480/40 nm filter) emitted through aperture 50 from below stage 48, and fluorescence emission data was collected (Chroma HQ 535/50 nm filter) during an exposure time of 80-100 msec. The image acquisition rate was 1 Hz. The external isolation box (Oko Lab) maintained temperature (37\u00b0 C.) and blocked ambient light. A transparent plastic multi-well plate, such as a transparent ninety-six well plate, was mounted on microscope stage 48 using a clamp (not shown) to serve as a specimen platform 56. The clamp fixed the ninety-six well plate firmly to microscope stage 48 to avoid vibration during blast simulation. The microscope condenser was removed to allow access for connecting the pneumatic device to specimen platform 56.",
                        "Specimen platform 56 is movable to a location to be impinged by the simulated blast shock wave as it is emitted through outlet orifice 34 so that imaging apparatus 52 views a biological specimen on the illuminated specimen platform as the simulated blast shock wave from outlet orifice 34 impinges the specimen. To isolate the blast shock wave and assess its effect on a particular biological specimen (such as nerve cells layered on the bottom of a well and covered with cell medium medium) a specimen chamber (such as a well 58 of the multiple-well plate shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B) is provided on the specimen platform. Leg 30 of T-connector 28 is coupled in a substantially sealed relationship to the specimen chamber to allow the blast shock wave to be directed at substantially only the specimen in the specimen chamber. The particular coupling illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B is achieved by providing internal spiral threads on the interior wall of well 58 that mate with the external spiral threads of leg 30. The external threads of leg 30 are screwed into the threads on the interior wall of well 58 to fix leg 30 to well 58 in a substantially fixed and sealed engagement.",
                        "In use, a biological specimen (such as nerve cells in or covered by cell medium) that is to be exposed to the blast shock wave is placed in a well 58 (FIG. 3B) of specimen platform 56 (FIG. 4). Well 58 is then moved to one of a plurality of positions above objective 54 (FIG. 4) by manipulating a control stick 62 (FIG. 1A) that controls motorized stage 48. Once the specimen chamber is in position over the microscope, then the primary conduit can be assembled by connecting hose 16 to the quick release valves. Threaded leg 30 (FIG. 3B) is screwed into threaded well 58 to form an isolated chamber into which the blast shock wave is to be directed. The volume and/or depth of cell medium or other liquid in chamber 58 can be varied to control the amount of shear force experienced by cells layered on the bottom of the well. Trigger 22 (FIG. 4) is actuated to release a preselected pneumatic charge from canister 12 that simulates a blast shock wave of an explosion (for example from an improvised explosive device) that could cause an injury, such as a blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). The blast shock wave then travels from air gun 14 along primary conduit axis 36 (FIG. 4) through the primary conduit 14, tube 16, valves 18, 24, coupling 26 and arms 28a, 28b of T-connector 28.",
                        "The simulated blast shock wave impinges against the occlusion member of quick release valve 32 to impede the flow of the wave and redirect it into leg 30 and through outlet orifice 34 into the well 58. As the pressure in T-connector 28 increases to a maximum preselected amplitude, the occlusion member of valve 32 overcomes the resistance that has maintained it engaged with the internal threads of arm 28b so that the occlusion member is forced out of arm 28b to open arm 28b to the atmosphere. The flow of the blast wave then vents through arm 28b to the atmosphere. As the gas now rapidly flows in the direction of axis 36 over the open top of leg 30, the pressure in leg 30 and well 58 is rapidly reduced by a Venturi effect that quickly reduces the pressure in well 58 below the original baseline pressure in the well, to simulate the waveform of a Friedlander curve.",
                        "The disclosed device can therefore be used in methods of assessing a response of tissue or cells to a simulated blast shock wave by positioning a specimen on the specimen platform adjacent outlet orifice 34, and activating trigger 22 for selectively releasing the compressed gas into the primary conduit formed by air gun 14, tube 16, valves 18, 24, coupling 26 and arms 28a, 28b of T-connector 28. A flow of gas moves through the primary conduit and out of outlet orifice 34 to produce the simulated blast shock wave that impinges the specimen. The effect of the blast shock wave on the specimen can then be observed, for example by viewing a recording of the effect of the shock wave on the specimen. Since the specimen is being observed through a microscope, changes can be detected that would not otherwise be visible to the unaided vision.",
                        "An image of the specimen enlarged by a microscope can be viewed in real time through microscope eyepieces 60 (FIG. 1A), or the response of the specimen to the blast shock wave can be viewed on a video screen (not shown). The video screen can display the image either as it occurs, or preferably as a play-back of a recorded image, for example by viewing stop frames of the recorded image at different time points of interest.",

                                "As shown in FIGS. 1A and 3B, leg 30 of T-connector 28 of device 10 was attached to one of the ninety-six wells of platform 56 on the motorized microscope stage 48. Using control stick 62, well 58 was positioned over aperture 50 (FIG. 4) of stage 48 and over the microscope objective lens 54 of imaging apparatus 52. The amplitude of the pressure transient (maximum pressure amplitude) produced by pneumatic discharge of device 10 was varied by altering the number of turns of adjustable quick release plug into internally threaded arm 28b (FIGS. 1A, 1B, 3A 3B and 4). The pressure waveform characteristics produced in chamber 58 by this device were comparable to those recorded at a subject target in open field blasts; the pressure waveform profile in chamber 58 closely resembles a classic Friedlander curve (FIG. 5). Friedlander curves are described in more detail in Brode et al., Blast Wave from a Spherical Charge, Physics of Fluids, 2:217-229 (1959). The simulated blasts were generated with rise times in the 0.1 msec range before valve 32 opened, and a two component falling phase: a fast component dropping below ambient pressure within 0.5 msec, and a slower component returning to ambient pressure within 2 msecs (FIG. 5). Pressure transient pressures having maximum amplitudes from 6-15 atm were examined by varying the number of rotations of the plug into the threads of T-connector arm 28b. Differing preselected pressure amplitudes can readily be selected by varying the number of rotations of the plug and measuring pressure transient amplitudes produced thereby. Pressures generated in the wells can be measured using a fiber optic pressure sensor on the interior wall of leg 30 (as in FIG. 3C).",
                                "Each blast created not only a fast transient pressure wave, but also shear forces originating at the interface of the gas and liquid. To control the magnitude of shear forces at the cell surface, the well volume was manipulated as larger media volumes increased the distance between cells and the gas-liquid interface, thus reducing the shear forces acting on the cells. To measure the shear forces within the cell plane (generally at the bottom of the well), fluorescent beads (Molecular Probes L-14822 component E) were used as reference markers on the bottom of wells with varying fluid volumes and subjected to blast shocks (peak pressure 11 atm). Beads in wells containing 150 and 180 \u03bcl exhibited fast motion in response to a blast (FIG. 6A, With Shear) but beads in 380 \u03bcL exhibited no motion with blast (FIG. 6B, Without Shear). Hereinafter, these two volume ranges will be referred to as with and without shear, although the specified volumes are only specific examples of how shear was induced and avoided. Once shear forces at the cell plane are calibrated for a particular experimental system, then the volume of depth of liquid in well 58 can be used to selectively control shear pressure on the cells during subsequent experimentation.",
                                "Analyzing only those trajectories that were two-dimensional and had no self- or inter-crossings, an estimate of the shear stress during a significant part of the impulse was calculated and found to be \u02dc0.2 Pa averaged over 70 msec with peak shear stress <1 Pa (FIG. 10C). In all measurements without shear the velocities and stresses were lower than the lowest shear that could be estimated by the disclosed technique, <0.0001 Pa. Although this example has been illustrated with particular volumes of liquid in a cylindrical well that is 0.6 cm in diameter, other volumes and depths of different liquids could be used and shear measured using the fluorescent bead assay described in this example. In particular embodiments, a volume/depth of liquid that produces no shear would be selected that produces less than 1 Pa, and particularly less than 0.0001 Pa., and shear forces above 1 Pa. would be selected for measuring shear effects on cells using the fluorescent bead methods disclosed in this example. Different volumes and depths of different liquids can be chosen to measure different shear stress effects on the specimen, once initial calibration of the system has been performed as described in this example."

The average calcium response of cells first exposed to a blast without shear forces and then a blast with shear forces was significantly different (p<0.01, n=6; FIG. 7D).

We analyzed the correlation between calcium load and cell survival for a period up to 20 hours following blast exposure with survival evaluated 20 hours after the blast. There was no correlation between cell survival and blasts with or without shear forces; the regression slope is not significantly different from zero, p<0.01 (FIG. 8B), nor was survival altered in two mock experiments (380 \u03bcl volume but no blast) which were not statistically different from the mean survival of all blasts, p<0.01.

Modifications included replacing the gun barrel with an 8-inch tube having a high-pressure hose quick connection, modifying the hammer and the spring mechanism that controls the hammer trigger, and changing the gas tank valve. The gas mixture in the pneumatic device, which was pressurized to 1500 psi, was 95% air and 5% CO2. To simulate an open field blast the T-connector externally threaded leg 30 was threaded vertically into the corresponding internal threads of the well while the internally threaded arms ran horizontally above the well (FIG. 3B). Arm 28a was attached to the high-pressure hose while the other arm 28b was used for the release valve.",
                                "To simulate an explosive blast, a quick release valve 32 was used. The simple and reproducible quick release valve was a filter plug taken from a 1250 \u03bcl pipette tip (Thermo Scientific) that was inserted into the threads of the internally threaded arm 28b. Using \u2159-1\u00bc turns resulted in 6-15 atm peak overpressure above ambient pressure. A \u2159 turn produced 6 atm peak overpressure, while 1\u00bc turns provided 15 atm peak pressure. The quick release valve was preferred as compared to a fixed pressure release valve with a significantly longer rise time. When the air gun trigger was pulled, the device was activated, releasing a burst of pressurized gas from the tank. As the pressurized gas was released, the quick release valve on the T-connector trapped gas and a rapid increase in pressure was created within the well. When the pressure exceeded the limit of the quick release valve the plug was ejected, allowing the gas to escape, and resulting in a rapid decay of overpressure as the accumulated pressure was released. The rapid gas flow through the narrow horizontal portion of the T-connector creates a drop in pressure in the well (Venturi effect), to below ambient levels."

During acquisition of a continuous series of frames with 400 ms exposure time each, the pressure pulse was applied to wells with different fluid volumes. The trajectory of a moving bead appears in one of the frames as a continuous curve of varying intensity (see FIG. 6). The position-dependent brightness of a particular track is inversely proportional to the bead velocity along the track. The exposure time and camera gain were selected guided by three main goals: capturing the bead movement in one frame, detecting sufficient light during the highest bead velocity, and minimizing camera saturation at low velocities. The correlation between light intensity and exposure time is calculated by averaging the intensities of static beads using different exposure times in the range of 10 ms-400 ms. This calibration is used to convert intensities of the moving beads into time units and define the arc length (i.e., the distance along the trajectory) of the bead trajectories over time.",

An approximate linear relation between the flow velocity and separation z from the surface is then used to estimate the shear stress. The main assumptions are: (i) the beads move together with the liquid (i.e., Brownian motions are negligible); (ii) the shear stress sensed by a cell is only due to the flow of media that is close to the chamber surface, z<6 \u03bcm; (iii) the beads used to evaluate flow have a quasi-two dimensional path (i.e., move mostly in the x-y plane and not the z-direction). In all experiments analyzed there is a clear correlation between trajectories of the moving beads, justifying the assumption that for short time periods after the blast the beads move together with the surrounding liquid. However, the bead trajectory characteristics varied; in some experiments the trajectories were three-dimensional with beads moving out of the focal plane. This behavior may be related to turbulence. Even when most beads moved, a few beads exhibited little or no movement. This behavior may be related to strong surface adhesion.

Furthermore, the cells only respond with global elevations in intracellular free Ca2+ when sufficient shear forces are simultaneously induced with the pressure profiles. These results makes it unlikely that the primary effect of a blast shock wave on brain cells in vivo is a direct effect of the compression and tension forces created by the pressure transient per se. However, the observed correlations between cellular response and shear forces, and the lack of correlation to pressure, per se, suggest that shear forces are likely involved in the primary injury phase of bTBI.",

It is this difference in speed that creates shear, potentially between brain cells. Depending on the orientation of their CNS tissues with the blast propagation, different shear forces may develop and the shockwave may encounter membrane interfaces with different susceptibility to damage. Thus, this is in agreement with observations both in in vivo models, as well as with human injuries in which expression of bTBI symptoms among different individuals that are exposed to the same blast is heterogeneous.",

Homogenization of brain tissue begins with a power driven pestle creating macroscopic shearing that we estimate at \u02dc10 Pa. Yet such shear forces are insufficient to detach the pre-synaptic terminal from the post-synaptic terminal, thus the adhesion of the interneuronal junction surpasses that of cellular membrane integrity, and the tubular necks of membrane that attach the synapse to the axon, dendrite or cell body preferentially rupture instead, yielding the synaptosome. These properties of the synaptosome preparation suggest that shear stress acts directly at the cell membrane. Thus, it is more likely that the primary injury of bTBI involves a direct rupture of the cell membrane, resulting in calcium entry, rather than a direct disruption of neuronal connectivity. Cell injury is often followed by swelling, which may secondarily disrupt connectivity.",

The results shown herein demonstrate that calcium is elevated transiently for short periods of time (seconds to a few minutes), and cell death does not occur even after 20 hours following this excitation. Brain cells exposed to blast wave profiles lacking shear forces had no calcium response, even at peak pressures up to 15 atm and trough pressures of 0.2 atm, suggesting that a shear dependent mechanism of primary bTBI may involve mechano-sensitive channels, lipidic pores, or uniquely vulnerable regions of the neuronal plasma membrane, leading to activation of a small population of cells and subsequent amplification through cell-cell signaling. The high curvature stress at the necks of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic boutons or fine processes of astrocytes may be an example of vulnerable regions since the curvature stress would add to the shear stress at those points, known to disassemble during homogenization.",
                                "Using primary human brain cell cultures at the level of single and small networks of cells, we found that shear forces acting at cellular length scales, rather than changes in pressure per se control the major activation parameter of CNS derived cell culture, intracellular calcium. Rapid compression and positive tension alone do not appear to cause calcium dependent cell-cell signaling following a BSW. This is one example of the usefulness of the device and methods disclosed herein for studying the response of cells to blast shock waves.",
