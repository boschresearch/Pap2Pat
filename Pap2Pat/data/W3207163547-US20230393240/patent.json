The RDIs can resolve objects in the scene along range dimension and Doppler dimension. To obtain an RDI, a two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transformation (e.g., a fast Fourier transformation, FFT) of a frame included in a radar measurement dataset can be executed. Here, a fast-time dimension of the radar measurement dataset can be converted to the range data of the RDI; and the slow-time dimension of the radar-measurement can be converted to the Doppler data of the RDI.",
                        "Alternatively, or additionally to such RDIs, an input to the ML algorithm can include 2-D angular measurement maps. The 2-D angular measurement maps can resolve two angular dimensions, typically called elevation and azimuthal dimensions. The 2-D angular measurement maps correspond to an image-like 2-D representation of a signal intensity for different elevation angles and azimuthal angles. This means that a lateral resolution of objects in the scene can be provided. The contrast of the 2-D angular measurement maps may not or at least not directly encode the range or velocity of a respective object arranged at the corresponding lateral position (in contrast to RDIs). The 2-D angular measurement maps can be determined by using a beamforming algorithm or any frequency estimation algorithm. For instance, a 2-D Capon spectral analysis can be implemented on an RDI; information from at least 2 antennas is used for angle estimation, i.e., one RDI for each antenna.",

In general, gross or large-amplitude bodily movements of humans are referred as macro-Doppler motions. Examples would be running or walking. Small-amplitude bodily movements or gestures of humans are referred to as micro-Doppler motions. A further example would be the pulmonary periodic motion due to cardiac or respiratory signals of humans. A radar measurement dataset includes features from large-amplitude movements at comparably high Doppler frequencies (and typically in short time bursts). In contrast, small-amplitude movements\u2014e.g., minor body movements observed at activities such as standing still, watching TV, eating, cooking or working on a computer\u2014are typically evenly spread out across time domain, i.e., less bursty if compared to macro-Doppler motions. Small-amplitude movements appear at correspondingly low Doppler frequencies.",

This increases the overall accuracy of the estimation of the people count. For instance, suppression of micro-Doppler features by side lobes of macro-Doppler features is avoided. The training of the range-Doppler convolutional layers can be tailored to extract characteristic micro-Doppler features in the micro-Doppler data processing pipeline and to extract characteristic macro-Doppler features in the macro-Doppler data processing pipeline.",

Such correlations between macro-Doppler features in micro-Doppler features can be captured at the connecting sections. Further, by using such connecting sections, it has been observed that robustness of the people counting against variation in the pose of the radar sensor with respect to the scene can be enhanced. For instance, it is possible to obtain a robust estimation of the people count for different shearing angles (i.e., radar angle incidence with its vertical position) and/or multiple aspect angles (i.e., radar angle incidence on the ground) of the radar sensor with respect to the scene. For instance, where connecting sections are used, this helps to distinguish whether a person is sitting or stopped walked, for various shearing and aspect angles.",

In detail, a time sequence of radar measurement datasets is obtained and the NN processes each radar measurement dataset individually, e.g., using multiple data processing pipelines as explained above for macro-Doppler features and micro-Doppler features, respectively. Then, the feature vector determined for each radar measurement dataset in the time sequence typically marks different positions in the embedding space. To avoid artificial changes between people counts on a short timescale, a smoothing can be applied to the associated people count is determined based on the positions of the feature vectors in the embedding space.",

The tracking filter can thus track, in the embedding space, the position of the feature vectors output by the regression block for multiple subsequent radar measurement datasets.",
