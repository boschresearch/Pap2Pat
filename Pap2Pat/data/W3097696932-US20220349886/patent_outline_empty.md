## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Example 1—Plasma SPM Concentrations are Predictive of Responsiveness to DMARD Treatment in RA Patients

### Example 2—Baseline RvD4, 10S, 17S-diHDPA, 15R-LXA4, MaR1n-3 DPA Concentrations are Predictive of DMARD-Treatment Outcome in RA Patients

### Example 3— Pre-Treatment Lipid Mediator Profiles Identify Distinct Disease Pathotypes

### Example 4—Increased SPM in DMARD-Responders when Compared to Non-Responders 6 Months after Treatment

### Example 5—SPM Mediate the Protective Actions of MTX in Experimental Inflammatory Arthritis

### Example 6— Activation of p-300 and MAPK by MTX Increases SPM Production and Protects During Experimental Inflammatory Arthritis

### Example 7— Summary of Suitable Sample Processing Method
