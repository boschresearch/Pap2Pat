### Example 1—Plasma SPM Concentrations are Predictive of Responsiveness to DMARD Treatment in RA Patients

- investigate lipid mediator profiles in RA patients
- identify distinct clusters of DMARD-responders and DMARD-non-responders
- evaluate predictive power of lipid mediator concentrations for treatment outcome

### Example 2—Baseline RvD4, 10S, 17S-diHDPA, 15R-LXA4, MaR1n-3 DPA Concentrations are Predictive of DMARD-Treatment Outcome in RA Patients

- identify specific lipid mediators as biomarkers for treatment responsiveness

### Example 3— Pre-Treatment Lipid Mediator Profiles Identify Distinct Disease Pathotypes

- investigate lipid mediator profiles in RA patients with different disease pathotypes

### Example 4—Increased SPM in DMARD-Responders when Compared to Non-Responders 6 Months after Treatment

- analyze lipid mediator profiles in DMARD responders and non-responders 6 months after treatment
- identify differentially expressed mediators and pathway markers between the two patient groups

### Example 5—SPM Mediate the Protective Actions of MTX in Experimental Inflammatory Arthritis

- investigate regulation of SPM production by MTX in human whole blood and mice

### Example 6— Activation of p-300 and MAPK by MTX Increases SPM Production and Protects During Experimental Inflammatory Arthritis

- investigate MTX-induced SPM production via CBP/p300 and MAPK pathways
