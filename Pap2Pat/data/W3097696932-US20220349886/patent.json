    "abstract": "The present invention provides a method for predicting whether a patient having, suspected of having, or at risk of developing an inflammatory condition will respond to treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) comprising measuring the level of at least one specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) in a DMARD na\u00efve patient sample and classifying the patient as a predicted DMARD responder or a predicted DMARD non-responder. The present invention also provides a method of assessing the efficacy of a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for use in the treatment of an inflammatory condition in a patient. The present invention also provides a method of predicting which rheumatoid arthritis pathotype a patient having, suspected of having, or at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis will develop.",

                "It is widely believed that a precision medicines approach is likely to be more effective in the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, including those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), than the current process where patients are treated in a prescriptive manner using a one size fits all approach. Unfortunately, the lack of robust biomarkers to determine treatment responsiveness in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, has hindered the development of this approach in clinical settings.",
                "Results described herein demonstrate that plasma lipid mediator concentrations prior to the initiation of treatment are different in patients that respond to DMARDs when compared with those that do not. Using machine learning methodologies, the inventors found that the concentrations of a group of mediators known as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) were predictive of treatment responsiveness in two RA cohorts, with prediction accuracy for response to treatment of up to \u02dc95%. Furthermore, plasma SPM concentrations prior to DMARD treatment initiation were also found to reflect the distinct joint disease pathotypes. Of note, while the patients enrolled in this study were DMARD na\u00efve, most of the patients in both cohorts were on a wide range of other medications for a number of co-morbidities. Therefore, the identification of a specific lipid mediator signature that is predictive of DMARD responsiveness suggest that changes in these lipid mediators are specific for this group of therapeutics. Given that SPM regulate host innate and adaptive immune responses and that SPM production is reflective of leukocyte activation status (Dalli, J. & Serhan, C. N. \u201cSpecific lipid mediator signatures of human phagocytes: microparticles stimulate macrophage efferocytosis and pro-resolving mediators.\u201d Blood 120, e60-72 (2012), Gao, Y., et al. \u201cFemale-Specific Downregulation of Tissue Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils Drives Impaired Regulatory T Cell and Amplified Effector T Cell Responses in Autoimmune Dry Eye Disease.\u201d J Immunol 195, 3086-3099 (2015), and Serhan, C.

                "The biosynthesis of SPM involves the stereoselective conversion of essential fatty acids by distinct enzymes, with the successful formation of the bioactive product relying on the expression and activity of the enzyme as well as their appropriate subcellular localization. Chiral chromatographic analysis of plasma 6-months post treatment demonstrated a predominance of the S-isomers of the monohydroxylated fatty acids. While this observation does not exclude the contribution of enzymes such as cytochrome P450 enzymes in the formation of the monohydroxylated fatty acids measured, it suggests that ALOX activity is sustained in DMARD-non-responders despite peripheral blood SPM concentrations being overall reduced in this patient group. Thus, suggesting that the SPM biosynthetic pathways become uncoupled post DMARD treatment initiation."

                        "Patients and Diseases",
                        "As used herein, the terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpatient\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to a human or a non-human mammal. The subject may be a companion non-human mammal (i.e. a pet, such as a dog, a cat, a guinea pig, or a non-human primate, such as a monkey or a chimpanzee), an agricultural farm animal mammal, e.g. an ungulate mammal (such as a horse, a cow, a pig, or a goat) or a laboratory non-human mammal (e.g., a mouse and a rat). The invention may find greatest application in connection with the treatment of human subjects.",
                        "The inflammatory condition may be rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis associated with ankylosing spondylitis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), periodontal disease, asthma, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease or a neurological disorder such as Alzheimer's disease. The inflammatory condition may be cardiovascular disease (CVD) or rheumatoid arthritis. Preferably, the inflammatory condition is rheumatoid arthritis. In any of the embodiments herein, the subject may be a human. The subject may be a subject diagnosed with an inflammatory condition, for example Rheumatoid Arthritis. The subject may be a subject undergoing treatment for an inflammatory condition, for example Rheumatoid Arthritis.",
                        "The method advantageously allows personalisation of medicine. Because each patient will have differences in the genetics and their environment when compared to any other patient, they may respond differently to drugs, including DMARDs. If a patient is not responding to a DMARD then an alternative therapy may be needed. The method of the invention therefore allows better clinical decision making for an individual patient. The patient may be described as an \u201cindividual patent\u201d accordingly.",
                        "Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)",
                        "Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a category of drugs. The members of this category of drugs are known to the person skilled in the art. The skilled person also knows what drugs are not DMARDs, for example, statins are not DMARDs. Statins include atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin, none of which are DMARDs. DMARDs include both biological (or \u201cbiologic\u201d) and non-biological (or \u201cnon-biologic\u201d) drugs.",
                        "Biological DMARDs include etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, which are all part of a class of drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and a variety of other agents with different targets, including anakinra, abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab.",
                        "Non-biological DMARDs include methotrexate, aspirin, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide. Another common non-biological DMARDs is sulfasalazine. Less frequently used non-biological DMARDs include gold salts, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. The DMARD may therefore be selected from the group consisting of methotrexate, aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, gold salts, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. The DMARD may be selected from the group consisting of methotrexate, aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and sulfasalazine. The DMARD may be selected from the group consisting of methotrexate, aspirin, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide. The DMARD may be methotrexate.",
                        "Known details concerning some frequently used non-biological DMARDs are provided below. In each case, a problem with non-biological DMARD treatment may be the need for patient monitoring, toxicity and side effects.",
                        "Methotrexate",
                        "Methotrexate was originally used as a chemotherapy treatment for cancer. When used in much lower doses for rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases, methotrexate works to reduce inflammation and to decrease joint damage. It is taken weekly (on the same day each week) as a pill, liquid, or injection. Methotrexate may be combined with other DMARDs or with a biologic agent if methotrexate alone does not adequately control disease.",
                        "Common side effects include upset stomach and mouth sores. Methotrexate can rarely interfere with the bone marrow's production of blood cells. Low blood cell counts can cause fever, infections, swollen lymph nodes, and easy bruisability and bleeding. Liver function problems can occur, even with low doses, and therefore regular blood tests are necessary for anyone taking methotrexate. People using methotrexate should also limit alcohol use because of the increased risk of liver injury with this combination. Rare injury to the lung can occur, and methotrexate should be stopped if the person develops a new cough and shortness of breath. Women should not become pregnant while taking methotrexate.",
                        "Proper monitoring is critical to identify drug toxicity in people taking methotrexate. Testing is performed prior to starting treatment to evaluate baseline blood counts and check kidney and liver function. These tests are repeated every 4 to 6 weeks for the first few months then every 8 to 12 weeks thereafter. The dose of methotrexate can be modified if problems are noted. Anyone taking methotrexate should take folic acid (1 mg daily) or folinic acid (5 mg weekly) to reduce the risk of certain side effects, such as upset stomach, mouth sores, low blood cell counts, and abnormal liver function.",
                        "Sulfasalazine",
                        "Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and of arthritis associated with ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). It is not clear how sulfasalazine works. It may be combined with other DMARDs if a person does not respond adequately to one medication. It is taken as a pill two times per day, and it is usually started at a low dose and is increased slowly to minimize side effects.",
                        "Side effects of sulfasalazine include changes in blood counts, nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to sunlight, skin rash, and headaches. People who are allergic to sulfonamide medications, such as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sample brand names: Bactrim, Septra), may have a cross-reaction to sulfasalazine and should therefore not take it. Periodic blood tests are recommended to monitor the blood count on a regular basis.",
                        "Sulfasalazine is a yellow-orange colour; people who take it may notice that their urine, tears, and sweat develop an orange tinge, which can stain clothing and contact lenses. Its important to drink plenty of fluids while taking sulfasalazine and to avoid taking it on an empty stomach or with antacids.",
                        "Hydroxychloroquine",
                        "Hydroxychloroquine, originally developed as a treatment for malaria, was later found to improve symptoms of arthritis. It can be used early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis and is often used in combination with other DMARDs. It is also very frequently used for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be combined with steroid medications to reduce the amount of steroid needed. It is usually taken in pill form once or twice per day.",
                        "Taking a high dose of hydroxychloroquine for prolonged periods of time may increase the risk of damage to the retina of the eye, although high doses are not usually required for treatment of rheumatic conditions. An eye examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended before starting treatment and periodically thereafter. It is common to have an eye check-up done once each year.",
                        "Leflunomide",
                        "Leflunomide inhibits production of inflammatory cells to reduce inflammation. It is often used alone but may be used in combination with methotrexate for people who have not responded adequately to methotrexate alone or together with a biologic agent. It is taken by mouth once daily.",
                        "Side effects include rash, temporary hair loss, abnormal liver function tests, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, and neuropathy (nerve damage). High blood pressure can occur in up to 10 percent of people. Testing for prior exposure to hepatitis and regular blood testing while on therapy are needed to monitor for liver damage and other toxicities. Women should not become pregnant while taking leflunomide or while it is still detectable in the body.",
                        "Azathioprine",
                        "Azathioprine has been used in the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and a variety of other inflammatory illnesses since the 1950s. It has also been used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.",
                        "The most common side effects of azathioprine include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, liver function abnormalities, low white blood cell counts, and infection. It is usually taken by mouth once daily. Regular blood testing is recommended during treatment with azathioprine.",
                        "Typically, the invention relates to non-biological DMARDs, for example the invention may be defined as a method of assessing the efficacy of a non-biological DMARD. An advantage of the invention is that it may inform and improve clinical decision making, in particular, it may provide a more rapid determination that a non-biological DMARD is not effective and therefore permit an early and efficient change of treatment to a different non-biological DMARD or to a biological DMARD.",
                        "Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs)",
                        "SPM are molecules produced by enzymes primarily carried in leukocytes for the essential fatty acids arachidonic acids (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (n-3 DPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). These molecules are central in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses during inflammation to facilitate its termination. SPM may also be referred to as \u201clipid mediators\u201d.",
                        "Without being bound by theory, an increase in the levels of at least one SPM are thought to indicate efficacy because SPM are protective mediators.",

The model may then be re-run based on the defined best mtry value. As for the SVM models, a validation cohort is used to estimate the MCC value.

That second cycle can take another six months, totaling a year of disease progression and potentially irreversible damage, before an effective treatment (likely a biological) is used.

                                "In order to determine whether peripheral blood SPM concentrations are predictive of DMARD responsiveness in patients with RA, we investigated plasma lipid mediator profiles in deeply phenotyped early RA patients prior to treatment initiation (see table 6 for patient information). Plasma lipid mediators were identified in accordance with published criteria (Dalli, J., Colas, R. A., Walker, M. E. & Serhan, C. N. \u201cLipid Mediator Metabolomics Via LC-MS/MS Profiling and Analysis.\u201d Methods Mol Biol 1730, 59-72 (2018), the contents of which are incorporated by reference). In RA patient plasma we identified mediators from all four major essential fatty acid metabolomes, i.e. arachidonic acid (AA), EPA, n-3 DPA and DHA (Table 7). These included the EPA, n-3 DPA and DHA-derived resolvins and the n-3 DPA and DHA-derived protectins and maresins. We next used Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), which generates a regression model based on concentrations of lipid mediators differently expressed between two groups (Chong, J., Yamamoto, M. & Xia, J. MetaboAnalystR 2.0: \u201cFrom Raw Spectra to Biological Insights.\u201d Metabolites 9 (2019), the contents of which are incorporated by reference), to assess the concentrations of identified mediators between DMARD-responders and DMARD-non-responders. Here we observed two distinct clusters representing DMARD-responders and DMARD-non-responders (FIG. 1A, B). We next used the machine learning method random forests to build models based on plasma lipid mediator concentrations to further evaluate whether pre-treatment levels of these mediators were linked with DMARD responsiveness. Using this approach, we found that cumulative concentrations of the DHA (that includes the D-series resolvins, protectins and maresins) and EPA (that includes the E-series resolvins) metabolomes were the most accurate at predicting whether a patient would respond to treatment or not. The accuracy for the DHA metabolome at predicting outcome was of \u02dc81% and that of the n-3 DPA metabolome was of \u02dc69% (FIG. 1C and Table 8). Of note, these values were also higher than those obtained using a combination of clinical parameters that included the DAS28-ESR and rheumatoid factor concentrations (FIG. 1C).",
                                "In order to validate the robustness of our model we obtained peripheral blood lipid mediator profiles from a second cohort of DMARD naive patients composed of 36 responders and 22 non-responders, and tested whether the models generated using the different mediator metabolomes predicted outcome for patients in this cohort (see Tables 9 and 10 for patient clinical parameters and lipid mediator concentrations). For this purpose, we assessed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which evaluates the diagnostic potential of a classifier by varying its discrimination threshold. Assessment of the area under the curve for the generated plots demonstrated that the DHA metabolome gave an AUC of 0.44, whereas the n-3 DPA metabolome gave an AUC of 0.58 (FIG. 1D, FIG. 13 and Table 8). Similar findings were made using support vector machines, a different machine learning strategy. Here, the DHA metabolome gave the highest accuracy score of \u02dc62%, an AUC of 0.54, whilst the n-3 DPA metabolome gave an accuracy score of 61%, an AUC of 0.66 (Table 1). We further evaluated the ability of the n-3 DPA metabolome-based model to accurately categorize patients using the resulting confusion matrix of the model. Here we found that the model based on concentrations of n-3 DPA derived mediators was able to correctly classify \u02dc83% of responders in the appropriate category (FIG. 1E). Thus, these results indicate that baseline peripheral blood lipid mediator profiles are linked with DMARD treatment outcome.",
                                "Increased eicosanoid and SPM concentrations in peripheral blood from DMARD non-responders",
                                "To gain insights into mechanisms determining the responsiveness of patients to DMARD treatment, we conducted lipid mediator pathway analysis to identify which pathways were differentially regulated between the two patient groups. This demonstrated that there was an upregulation of SPM biosynthetic pathways, including the DHA derived RvD5 and the n-3 DPA derived RvT3 as well as the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, including the nociceptive mediators PGD2 and PGE2, in DMARD non-responders when compared with responders (FIG. 2). To determine whether the differences in SPM expression were linked with a distinct transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in SPM biosynthesis we assessed the transcript expression of ALOX enzymes in peripheral blood from these two patient groups. ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX15 and ALOX15B transcript levels were similar between the DMARD-responders and DMARD-non-responders (FIG. 3). These results suggest that regulation of SPM biosynthetic pathways may be via either the regulation of protein translation or posttranslational modification of the enzymes to regulate their activity (Dalli, J., Chiang, N. & Serhan, C. N. \u201cElucidation of novel 13-series resolvins that increase with atorvastatin and clear infections.\u201d Nat Med 21, 1071-1075 (2015) and Fredman, G., et al. Resolvin \u201cD1 limits 5-lipoxygenase nuclear localization and leukotriene 84 synthesis by inhibiting a calcium-activated kinase pathway.\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111, 14530-14535 (2014). The contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference). Thus, we next tested whether the activity of these enzymes was altered. For this purpose, we measured plasma levels of monohydroxylated fatty acids from all four fatty acid metabolomes to gain insights into their activity in the two patient groups. Assessment of plasma concentrations of 5-HETE, 5HEPE, 7-HDPA and 7-HDHA, markers of ALOX5 activity, revealed a significant upregulation of 7-HDHA, 5-HEPE and 5-HETE in DMARD-non-responders when compared with responders. Concentrations of markers for ALOX12 (14-HDPA and 14-HDHA) and ALOX15 (17-HDPA, 17-HDHA, 15-HEPE and 15-HETE) also demonstrated an increased in activity for these enzymes in non-responders (FIG. 4). Thus, these findings indicate that the observed increases in plasma SPM in non-responders was due to increased ALOX activity. To further evaluate the origin of these proposed pathway markers we conducted chiral liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry which permits the separation the R and S isomers of a given hydroxylated fatty acid. Here we found that in plasma of both DMARD responders and DMARD non-responders the most abundant isomer for all the monohydroxylated fatty acids tested was that carrying the alcohol in the S conformation (FIG. 14). Given that all four ALOX enzymes involved in SPM biosynthesis preferentially oxygenate fatty acids in the S conformation, these results indicate an increased ALOX activity in non-responders."

Having identified potential candidate biomarkers, we next built machine-learning models using the random forest methodology and concentrations of either RvD4, 10S, 17S-diHDPA, 15R-LXA4 and MaR1n-3 DPA or RvD4, 10S, 17S-diHDPA, 15R-LXA4, 5S,12S-diHETE, 4S,14S-diHDHA, MaR1n-3 DPA using a second group of DMARD naive patients (see Table 9 and 10 for patient clinical parameters and lipid mediator concentrations) and tested the ability of this model to assign patients to the correct outcome group.

We next validated the accuracy of these two models using mediator concentrations from a different group of DMARD naive patients. Results from these experiments demonstrated that the model build using the four mediators gave an AUC of 0.80, whereas the model built with the six mediators gave an AUC score of 0.79 (FIG. 1H).

Therefore, we next questioned whether immune-related features in each of these groups extended beyond the synovium into the systemic circulation. To address this question, we conducted lipid mediator profiling to assess whether peripheral blood lipid mediator concentrations in RA patients from each of these three groups were distinct prior to the initiation of DMARD therapy. Using PLS-DA we found that plasma lipid mediators were indeed characteristic for different disease pathotypes i.e. distinct lipid mediator profiles clustered with each category (FIG. 5A). Assessment of the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores, which identify the contribution of each mediator in the observed separation between groups demonstrated an upregulation of pro-resolving mediators, including 15R-LXA4 and MCTR2, in peripheral blood from patients with the Pauci-immune-fibroid pathotype. In plasma from these patients we also found an upregulation of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators including PGD2 and TxA2, measured as its stable the further metabolite TxB2 (FIG. 5B).",

These included significant increases in the DHA-derived RvD4, and PDX. Assessment of mediators from the AA and EPA metabolomes demonstrated an increase in ALOX5 products in non-responders with Lympho-myeloid and Pauci-immune-fibroid pathotypes that reached statistical significance in patients with a Pauci-immune-fibroid pathotype for the leukotriene (LT) B4 pathway including its further metabolite 20-COOH-LTB4.

OPLS-DA analysis demonstrated that plasma lipid mediator profiles from DMARD responders 6 months after the initiation of treatment were distinct from those of DMARD-non-responders, as demonstrated by a separation between the two patient clusters (FIG. 7A, Table 11). Assessment of VIP scores identified 21 mediators and SPM pathway markers that were differentially expressed between the two patient groups (FIG. 7B). Amongst these mediators we found SPM that are involved in coordinating the host response during ongoing inflammation such as PCTR2, RvD2 and RvD3 (Arnardottir, H. H., et al.

This analysis demonstrated that the concentrations of ALOX5 and ALOX15-derived mediators from both the n-3 DPA and DHA metabolomes were reduced in the plasma of non-responders when compared to responders (FIG. 7C). Pathway analysis of EPA and AA-derived lipid mediator concentrations demonstrated that while ALOX5 derived products of EPA were also reduced, AA-derived ALOX5 products, including those of the potent leukocyte chemoattractant LTB4 and the ionotropic cysteinyl leukotrienes (Radmark, O., Werz, O., Steinhilber, D. & Samuelsson, B. \u201c5-Lipoxygenase, a key enzyme for leukotriene biosynthesis in health and disease\u201d. Biochim Biophys Acta 1851, 331-339 (2015), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference), were markedly increased in plasma from non-responders when compared with responders (FIG. 7D).",
                                "Having observed significant decreases in SPM concentrations we next investigated whether the activity of ALOX enzymes and the conversion of DHA and n-3 DPA was altered in peripheral blood cells from the two patient groups. For this purpose, we measured plasma levels of monohydroxylated fatty acids from the DHA and n-3 DPA metabolomes to gain insights into both enzyme activity and substrate conversion. Plasma concentrations of the ALOX5 products 7-HDPA and 7-HDHA were either similar (7-HDPA) between the two patient groups, or upregulated (7-HDHA) in DMARD-non-responders. Concentrations of the ALOX12 (14-HDPA and 14-HDHA) and ALOX15 (17-HDHA and 17-HDPA) products were increased in non-responders (FIG. 8). Of note, as observed in baseline plasma, chiral analysis of monohydroxylated fatty acids demonstrated that the predominant isomer for each of these products was the S-isomer (FIG. 15). These findings indicate that the observed reduction in plasma DHA and n-3 DPA derived SPM in DMARD non-responders was not due to a decrease in ALOX activity and/or substrate availability/conversion in peripheral blood cells from these patients. Together these observations demonstrate that 6 months after treatment initiation plasma SPM concentrations in DMARD responders were higher than those measured in DMARD non-responders. Given that enzyme activity was elevated in non-responders when compared with responders, this suggests that uncoupling of the SPM biosynthetic pathways may be responsible for the reductions in plasma SPM concentrations."

Ther Drug Monit 18, 128-134 (1996), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference) led to an increase in plasma SPM concentrations as demonstrated by rightward shift in the SPM cluster in the OPLS-DA analysis. This shift was linked with an upregulation of mediators from the DHA, n-3 DPA and EPA bioactive metabolomes including DHA-derived PDX and RvD1 as well as the EPA-derived RvE3 (FIG. 9A-C and Table 12).",

Of note this shift was linked with an upregulation of several ALOX15-derived SPM including RvT1, RvT4 and RvD5n-3 DPA (FIG. 9D-E and Table 13). We next tested whether the regulation of SPM was central to the joint protective actions of MTX in experimental inflammatory arthritis. For this purpose, we administered MTX to wild type (WT) mice and mice that lack ALOX15 (Alox151 and assessed joint disease activity. As anticipated, administration of MTX to WT mice led to a significant reduction in clinical scores, an improvement in weight loss and a decrease in paw edema (FIG. 10A-C). In these studies, we also found a decrease in the number of eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages that were recruited to the joint as well as a reduction in inflammatory eicosanoid concentrations (FIGS. 10D and 11). Of note the protective actions of MTX were lost in mice lacking the ALOX15 enzyme. In these mice, MTX no longer regulated disease activity, weight loss (FIG. 10A-C), leukocyte trafficking (FIG. 10D) as well as peripheral blood and circulating eicosanoid concentrations (FIG. 11).

Given that these two pathways are also implicated in the regulation of ALOX15 expression (Shankaranarayanan, P., Chaitidis, P., Kuhn, H. & Nigam, S. \u201cAcetylation by histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein/p300 of STAT6 is required for transcriptional activation of the 15-lipoxygenase-1 gene\u201d.

Nat Commun 7, 12859 (2016) the contents of all of which are incorporated by reference) we next questioned whether they were involved in the observed increases in SPM production by MTX. For this purpose, we employed a pharmacological approach to assess whether inhibitors to these pathways blocked MTX-induced upregulation of SPM in human peripheral blood. Here we found that incubation of whole blood with inhibitors to both CBP/p300 (L002) and MAPK (SB202190) markedly shifted the plasma lipid mediator profile blocking the MTX-induced upregulation of SPM, decreasing the concentrations of several mediators including PD1, MaR2n-3 DPA and in the anti-arthritic RvD1 (Norling, L. V., et al. \u201cProresolving and cartilage-protective actions of resolvin D1 in inflammatory arthritis\u201d. JCI Insight 1, e85922 (2016), the contents of which are incorporated by reference) (FIG. 12A, B). We next tested whether inhibition of these pathways also reversed the anti-arthritic actions of MTX in experimental inflammatory arthritis. Here we found that administration of either L002 or SB202190 reversed the anti-arthritic actions of MTX, as measured by an increase in joint inflammation, an increase in joint damage, and an increase in weight loss, a marker of disease activity (FIG. 12C-E). Administration of these inhibitors also reversed the ability of MTX to regulate neutrophil trafficking to the inflamed joint, an observation that was linked with an increase in the joint concentrations of the potent leukocyte chemoattractant LTB4 (FIG. 12F, G). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CBP/p300 or MAPK abrogates the beneficial effects of MTX on ALOX15 activity and the downstream beneficial effects on joint disease. These findings suggest that via the activation of CBP/p300 and MAPK, MTX regulates the activity of ALOX15 upregulating SPM production, dampening joint inflammation and joint damage during inflammatory arthritis."

The lipid mediator profile included DHA-derived resolvins (RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, RvD6, 17-RvD1 and 17-RvD3), protectins (PD1, 17-PD1, 10S,17S-diHDAH and 22-OH-PD1), PCTRs (PCTR1, PCTR2 and PCTR3), maresins (MaR1, MaR2, 7S,14S-diHDHA, 4,14-diHDHA, 14-oxo-MaR1 and 22-OH-MaR1), MCTRs (MCTR1, MCTR2 and MCTR3), 13-series resolvins (RvT1, RvT2, RvT3 and RvT4), n-3 DPA-derived resolvins (RvD1n-3 DPA, RvD2n-3 DPA and RvD5n-3 DPA), n-3-DPA derived protectins (PD1n-3 DPA and 10S, 17S-diHDPA), n-3 DPA-derived maresins (MaR1n-3 DPA), E-series resolvins (RvE1, RvE2 and RvE3), leukotrienes (LXA4, LXB4, 5S,15S-diHETE, 20-OH-LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4 and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4), cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2a) and thromboxane (TXB2). A Clinical Score model was obtained using the following clinical parameters: disease duration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF titre), tiredness visual analogue scale (VAS), pain VAS, patient global health VAS, physician global assessment VAS, swollen joints number, disease activity score-28 (DAS28) and 12 max US Synovial Thickness and US Power Doppler scores. A second patient cohort of 45 patients (37 responders and 8 non-responders) was obtained from the PEAC study and was used as the validation dataset for the lipid mediator profiling and Clinical Score models, and also as the training dataset for improved models based on specific biomarkers. Age, sex and clinical parameters not mentioned before were not considered for this first approximation of creating a model able to classify the response of RA patients to DMARD treatment.",

                                "Two supervised machine learning methodologies were used to create the classifier models: classyfire (Chatzimichali, E. A. & Bessant, C. \u201cNovel application of heuristic optimisation enables the creation and thorough evaluation of robust support vector machine ensembles for machine learning applications\u201d. Metabolomics 12, 16 (2016), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference) and randomForest (Breiman, L. Classification and Regression Trees, (Routledge, 2017), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Classyfire uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to separate groups by organizing the samples in two spaces divided by a hyperplane in a way that the distances between the samples in the same group are not too wide and the distance between the groups is as large as possible (Bennett, K. P. & Campbell, C. \u201cSupport vector machines.\u201d ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter 2, 1-13 (2000), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Besides that, it uses bootstrapping (new datasets created by iteratively resampling of the original data with replacement) to improve and validate the models. In this study, classyfire was implemented using the R Package \u201cclassyfire\u201d (https://crans-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/classyfire/), with 70 bootstrap iterations and 70 individual classifiers in each ensemble. We also used the inbuilt automatic optimization step that includes minimization of the bootstrapping error 36 in the R Package \u201cclassyfire\u201d to improve and validate the models (see FIG. 13 for representative outcomes).",

In this case, the R package \u201crandomForest\u201d (https://crans-project.org/package=randomForest) (which also uses bootstrapping as the validation method) was used with a parameters setting of 10,000 trees per run and the design of a small loop to define the best number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. Increasing the number of ntrees beyond this value did not markedly improve the outcomes (see FIG. 13 for representative outcomes).",
