                        "Filtrations systems and techniques for the isolation of targeted particles and removal of nontargeted particles are standard in both laboratory and clinical settings. This type of sorting process is applied across a wide range of spaces from disease diagnostics, to sample purifications for therapeutics, to cellular isolations for study and treatment of cell and tissue injury. The immense utility of these techniques has sprung the development of a variety of filtration systems. This variety can be summarily organized into two main modalities: labeled filtration and label-free filtration.",
                        "Labeled techniques include attaching other particles, such as biomolecules or primers, to the targeted particle in the system. One downside of such techniques is that attaching additional particles to the targeted particles may affect the function of those targeted particles after sorting. This can be particularly problematic when the targeted particles are being sorted for studies, therapeutics, or other treatments. Alternatively, label-free techniques do not involve attaching additional labeling particles to the targeted particles, but instead rely on mechanical properties of the targeted particles, such as size, density, and/or stiffness. The contraindications of labeled techniques have pushed the clinical sorting market away from labeling and towards label-free methods.",
                        "Size exclusion is one type of label-free technique that is well established as a method that avoids many of the negative effects of other filtration systems and methods. Two major size-based filtration systems used in laboratory and clinical settings are cross-flow filters and dead-end filters. Cross-flow filtration is a technique wherein the bulk flow from the feed stream runs parallel to the filtration surface, and the filtration occurs primarily via osmotic pressure. Conversely, dead-end systems are fluidic circuits where the filtration surface is set up perpendicular to the feed stream. Accordingly, this means that all particulate in the bulk sample must interact with the filtration surface to complete flow through the circuit.",
                        "Both size-based systems have their advantages and disadvantages. The industry utilizes four main metrics to analyze a filtration system's ability to isolate targeted from nontargeted particulate: purity, enrichment factor, recovery percentage, and throughput. An ideal system maintains a high value for each of these four metrics. Cross-flow systems obtain high purity and enrichment factors. However, the throughput and recovery percentage of the systems tend to be significantly lower than other size-based systems due to their parallel flow and osmotic-filtration characteristics\u2014many targeted particles merely pass by the filtration surface instead of passing through the surface.",
                        "Dead-end filtration achieves high purity, enrichment factor, and throughput. However, these systems also achieve poor recovery percentage. The perpendicular nature of these systems, where the bulk sample must interact with the filtration surface, causes what is known as membrane fouling. Fouling occurs when a fouling layer and a cake layer forms at one end of the filtration surface as particles build up. This buildup of cake prevents the targeted particles from passing through the filtration surface. As a result, permeate flux will approach zero as cake builds. Dead-end systems are an ideal target for improvement to filtration systems, however. Their enormous enrichment factors, high purity, and high throughput are desirable in the clinical and laboratory settings. What is needed, therefore, are systems and methods that maintain the beneficial characteristics of dead-end filtration but also eliminate the problems associated with particle recovery percentage."

                        "To facilitate an understanding of the principles and features of the disclosure, various illustrative embodiments are explained below. In particular, the presently disclosed subject matter is described in the context of pulse-modulated periodic backflush for dead-end filtration systems. The present disclosure, however, is not so limited and can be applicable in other contexts. For example, some embodiments of the present disclosure may improve the functionality of other filtration systems, including but not limited to cross-flow filtration systems, other size-based filtration systems, or any other filtration system that may comprise or create a fouling or cake layer. Additionally, although some embodiments of the present disclosure describe filtering biological particles, it will be understood that the present technologies are not limited to biological particles. For example, the presently disclosed technologies may improve the filtration and sorting of any particles that may be used within the filtration systems described herein. These embodiments are contemplated within the scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, when the present disclosure is described in the context of pulse-modulated periodic backflush for dead-end filtration systems, it will be understood that other embodiments can take the place of those referred to.",
                        "As described above, several size-based, label-free filtration systems are currently used within laboratory and clinical settings. Two popular systems within this category include cross-flow filtration systems and dead-end filtration systems. FIG. 1A is a representation of the flow of fluid and particles through a cross-flow filtration system 102, according to some embodiments. The fluid flow 104 in a cross-flow filtration system 102 runs parallel to the filtration surface 106. The separation of targeted particles 108 from nontargeted particles 110 occurs primarily via osmotic pressure through the filtration surface 106. FIG. 1B is a representation of the flow of fluid and particles through a dead-end filtration system 112, according to some embodiments. The fluid flow 114 in a dead-end filtration system 112 runs perpendicular to the filtration surface 116. Accordingly, both targeted particles 118 and nontargeted particles 120 in the bulk sample must interact with the filtration surface 116 to complete flow through the system. The term \u201cbulk\u201d within this disclosure refers to the suspension within the filtration system. For example, the bulk flow through a system refers to the flow of a suspension through the system, the suspension comprising a fluid and any number of particles suspended within the fluid. As will be discussed in more detail herein, in some embodiments, the filtration surface may comprise a membrane.",
                        "Both size-based systems have their advantages and disadvantages. The industry utilizes four main metrics to analyze a filtration system's ability to isolate targeted from nontargeted particulate: purity, enrichment factor, recovery percentage, and throughput. Purity is a metric used to measure the percentage of targeted particles 108/118 in the output of a system compared to total particulate in that system (i.e., the total of targeted particles 108/118 plus nontargeted particles 110/120 in the system). Enrichment factor is a ratio of ratios that shows the proportion of targeted 108/118 to nontargeted 110/120 particles in the output compared to the initial sample being processed at the input. Enrichment factor ranges from 0 to infinity. A value of 0 implies the permeate (or the recovered particles in the output) contains the same proportion of targeted to nontargeted particulate as what was supplied to the system, thus showing no isolation. A value of infinity would result from perfect permeate purity starting with any amount of contamination. Enrichment factor does not provide any indication of input or permeate concentration or quantity; this is determined by recovery percentage. Recovery percentage provides the number of targeted particles 108/118 at the output compared to what was initially supplied at the input. Throughput is a measure of the output quantity of targeted particles 108/118 as a function of processing time.",
                        "An ideal system maintains a high value for each of these metrics; however, different filter types can trade off performance in one of these metrics for performance in another. For example, cross-flow filtration systems 102 may obtain high purity and high enrichment factors, but the throughput and recovery percentage tend to be significantly lower than other size-based systems due to their parallel flow 104 and osmotic-filtration characteristics. Dead-end filtration systems 112 may also achieve high purity, enrichment factors, and throughput, yet the systems may also achieve poor recovery percentage. The perpendicular nature of these systems, where the bulk sample must interact with the filtration surface 116, causes what is known as membrane fouling. This fouling decreases the recovery percentage over time.",
                        "FIG. 2 depicts the formation of a cake layer 202 in a dead-end filtration system 112, according to some embodiments. In a dead-end filtration system 112, fouling of filtration surface 116 can be caused by pores or openings 204 within the surface becoming blocked. The first layer of blocking is what is known as the fouling layer 206. As more and more particles 118/120 build upon the fouling layer 206, a cake layer 202 grows on the filtration surface 116. As will be appreciated, in the field of filtration devices, the terms \u201cfouling layer,\u201d \u201ccake,\u201d and \u201ccake layer\u201d may be used interchangeably, and all mean the buildup of particles 118/120 along the filtration surface 116. Accordingly, throughout this disclosure, the terms \u201cfouling layer,\u201d \u201ccake,\u201d and \u201ccake layer\u201d are used interchangeably. As more and more particles 118/120 add to the cake layer, the flux of targeted particles 118 through the filtration surface 116 decreases exponentially.",
                        "FIG. 3 is an example representation of the exponential decay of permeate flux over a period of time within a dead-end filter, according to some embodiments. The graph shows the three phases of fouling. The first phase 302 is a period of rapid decline of permeate flux through the filtration surface. The second phase 304 is a period of tapering, where the decline in flux is steadier. However, as seen in the graph, a third phase 306 exists wherein the permeate flux will asymptotically approach zero as cake builds.",
                        "Dead-end filtration systems remain popular among laboratory and clinical settings. Despite their limitations with respect to recovery percentage, their purity and enrichment factors remain some of the highest in the industry. Accordingly, the systems are an ideal target for improvement so as to maintain the system's desirable attributes and to increase the recovery percentage for the systems.",
                        "The technologies disclosed herein improve dead-end filtration systems by applying what may be referred to as pulse-modulated (PM) periodic backflush, which is a system and method for breaking apart the cake formed along the filtration surface. FIG. 4 is a representation of PM periodic backflush for breaking apart a cake layer, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The first stage 402 of PM periodic backflush is a forward flush. In other words, in the first stage 402, the bulk flow travels through the filtration surface 116 as it would in an ordinary dead-end filtration system. As the bulk flow continues through the filtration surface 116, a cake layer 202 comprising targeted 118 and nontargeted particles 120 will form along one end of the filtration surface 116.",
                        "The next stage 404 of PM periodic backflush is an initiation of backflush through the system. The bulk flow of the system is reversed and passed back through the filtration surface 116. This reverse flow breaks apart the cake layer 202 that formed during the period of forward flow. The breaking apart of the cake layer 202 also causes a reintegration of the particles 118/120 into the bulk flow. As can be seen in FIG. 4, the reverse flow stage 404 cases some negative flux of the targeted particles 118 (i.e., back through the filtration surface). However, the degree of negative flux depends on the volume of fluid that passes in a forward direction as compared to a volume of fluid that passes in a reverse direction. This difference in volume will be discussed in greater detail herein.",
                        "The next stage 406 of PM periodic backflush is a re-initiation of forward flow through the filtration surface 116. As can be seen in FIG. 4, during the re-initiation stage 406, more targeted particles 118 have passed beyond the filtration surface than in the original forward-flow stage 402. Also, during the re-initiation stage 406, the flux can continue again until a new cake layer is formed. The next stage 408 indicates that the previous stages\u2014forward flow, reverse flow, forward flow\u2014are repeated periodically in this order to improve flux and increase permeation and recovery percentage of targeted particles 118.",
                        "In some embodiments, this cycling of forward flow, to reverse flow, to forward flow can be characterized as a square wave. As will be appreciated, a square wave is an appropriate representation of a binary system (on/off or, as in this case, forward/reverse). The positive part of a cycle is representative of forward flow and the negative part of a cycle is representative of reverse flow.",
                        "FIG. 5 is a model depicting the square-wave characteristics of PM periodic backflush, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As described above, as more and more particles add to a cake layer in a dead-end filtration system, the flux of targeted particles through the filtration surface decreases exponentially. The model in FIG. 5 depicts how PM periodic backflush, with its square-wave characteristics, affect this exponential decrease in permeate flux. The solute, or fluid, flowing through the system is represented by the square-wave flow profile 502. The effect of this fluid-flow profile 502 on the mass of the permeate (i.e., targeted particles) 504 recovered through the filtration system is also plotted.",
                        "The model in FIG. 5 shows that cycling from forward, to reverse, to forward flow can be divided into three regions. The first region 506 is a period of exponential decay associated with forward filtration. This exponential decay is expected in a typical forward-flowing dead-end filtration system. As the fluid-flow profile 502 decreases as cake builds, the permeation rate for the mass of targeted particles 504 permeating through the system also decreases. The second region 508 is a period of reverse flow. As can be seen, the reverse fluid-flow profile 502 corresponds to a negative flux of targeted particles 504. The third region 510 is a period of near ideal forward flush. This is shown in the model as a flat fluid-flow profile 502. The flat fluid-profile 502 may be the result of fluid flowing freely through the system because the cake layer is no longer present\u2014the particles that previously formed the cake layer have been re-integrated into the bulk flow. The third region 510 also shows a steady increase in the mass of targeted particles 504 permeating through the dead-end filtration system, as the targeted particles also are not restricted by a cake layer.",
                        "Important features of the square-wave-like PM periodic backflush is the volume of fluid flow in a forward cycle and the volume of fluid flow in a reverse cycle. As can be seen in the model in FIG. 5, when the fluid-flow profile 502 is in the reverse direction (negative flux), a portion of the mass of targeted particles 504 trends in a reverse direction (i.e., the targeted particles pass back through the filtration system). Therefore, an optimal ratio of forward flow to reverse flow is necessary to optimize permeate flux through the filter. The volume of fluid flow in a forward cycle and the volume of fluid flow in a reverse cycle also directly relate to the amount of cake build-up and break-up. For example, if the volume of flow in the forward direction is large, then a large cake layer will inherently build along the filtration surface. Accordingly, the volume of flow in the reverse direction must be great enough to break apart the cake and re-integrate the particles into the bulk flow. Therefore, an optimal ratio of forward flow to reverse flow is necessary to optimize cake break-up.",
                        "The ratio of one cycle of forward flow to one cycle of reverse flow is defined as the system's volumetric flow ratio. The volumetric flow ratio is represented by the equation:",
                        "\\(\\varphi = \\frac{V_{f}}{V_{f} + V_{r}}\\)",
                        "Here, \u03d5 is the volumetric flow ratio, Vf is the volume of fluid flowing through the filtration surface in the forward direction over one cycle, and Vr is the volume of fluid flowing through the filtration surface in the reverse direction over a cycle. A \u03d5 of 1.00, Vf=Vf+Vr, constitutes continuous forward flow with no reverse flow and is subject to standard exponential decay in flux as fouling occurs, as described above. Comparatively, a \u03d5=0.50, Vf=Vr, has the volumetric flow in the forward direction over a cycle equal to the volumetric flow in the reverse direction over a cycle. Therefore, with a \u03d5=0.50, no net processing would occur because the flux through the filtration surface would be equal to the flux back through the filtration surface.",
                        "A comparison can be made between the volumetric flow ratio and to duty cycle. Duty cycle is a term that refers to the time occupied by the cycle of operation of a machine or other device, especially as a percentage of available time. This is a metric used by mechanical and electrical engineers to define the percent of a period that a machine or waveform remains in the \u2018on\u2019 or functioning state compared to the total period or operating time in a recurring cycle. Pulse modulation of backflush is a technique that varies the volumetric flow ratio (or the duty cycle of the square wave described above) to achieve a desired effect. For example, the volumetric flow ratio \u03d5 refers to the percent of a period that the filtration system is in the \u201cforward volumetric flow\u201d state compared to the total period in a recurring cycle. A period in a PM system is a single cycle of forward flow plus a single cycle of reverse flow.",

Namely, the volumetric flow ratio may be altered by changing how long the system is flowing in that direction over a period of time. In other embodiments, other parameters may be changed besides time of flow. In some embodiments the volumetric flow rate in either the forward direction or the reverse direction may be altered. For example, a volumetric flow ratio \u03d5 of 0.5 may be achieved by flowing fluid in a forward direction at a first velocity for a set amount of time, and then flowing fluid in a reverse direction at a faster velocity for a shorter amount of time. In this embodiment, the result is the same, the volume flux is equal in forward and reversed directions, but the reverse direction achieved the volume flux in a shorter period of time due to the faster velocity. One way to conceive this embodiment would be to increase the amplitude of the reverse cycle \u03b2 in any of the charts in FIGS. 6A and 6B.

As described above, the controller 1018 may also alter the volumetric flow in either direction by altering the velocity (i.e., flow rate, or amplitude of the representative square waves) in either direction. In some embodiments, the volumetric flow in the forward direction is greater than the volumetric flow in the reverse direction. As shown in the above experimental section, if the volumetric flow ratio is 0.50, no net processing would occur because the flux through the membrane 1010 would be equal to the flux back through the membrane 1010.

For example, it is shown in the model of FIG. 5 that, after each period of cycle from forward to reverse, the next forward cycle will have slightly less solute flux (shown in flux profile 502). This steady increase of forward fluid flux through the system can be attributed to more and more nontargeted particles (first particles 1006) being near the membrane 1010 and less targeted particles (second particles 1008) passing through the membrane 1010; an increasing number of targeted particles (second particles 1008) will have permeated after each subsequent period of cycles. Accordingly, more and more irreversible cake will build up after each subsequent period of cycles. To counteract this decrease in forward flux, the controller 1018 may decrease the volumetric flow ratio after each period of cycles, progressing closer to \u03d5=0.50. Situations may exist wherein an increased volumetric flow rate in each subsequent period of cycles may be desired. For example and not limitation, if after a single period less cake builds, it may be desired to provide a greater volumetric flow in the forward direction in a subsequent period.

The cycling of forward to reverse may be based on the volumetric flow ratio described herein. Also, as described above, because the permeate recovery percentage has a linear relationship to volumetric flow ratio, the system may be designed to produce a desired seeding density.

For example and not limitation, the membrane may be a fibrous membrane, patterned microsieve membrane, pillar membrane, trap membrane, weir membrane, a tissue, or a membrane comprising microchannels. In some embodiments, the molecules that are intended to be administered into the cells may also be suspended in the cell medium along with the cells. The molecules are inherently smaller than the cells, so the molecules may also pass through the membrane 1010. In some embodiments, the molecules may be administered to the cells after PM filtration in a separate process.",
                                "In some embodiments, PM dead-end filtration may provide an advantageous system for shear permeabilization due to the nature of the forward to reverse flow through a membrane 1010. For example, the systems and methods described herein utilize membranes 1010 capable of inducing the shear stresses needed to permeabilize cells as the cells pass through the membrane 1010. In some embodiments, a controller may cycle the flow of the cell medium containing cells (or cells and molecules) in a forward direction and in a reverse direction. In the forward direction, at least a portion of the cells and molecules may permeate through an inlet 1012, through the membrane 1010, and to an outlet 1014. Also, as shown in FIGS. 4-5, in PM dead-end filtration, at least a portion of permeate (or targeted particles 118, which may be cells) may pass through a membrane 1010 (e.g., filtration surface 116 in FIG. 4) in the forward flow direction and pass through the membrane 1010 again in a reverse flow direction (reverse flux of the cells). Accordingly, a portion of the permeate passing through the membrane 1010 in a reverse direction may be subjected to additional shears. In some embodiments, once a cell passes through the membrane 1010, the shear stress provided by the membrane 1010 may permeabilize the permeated cells. Once permeated, the cells may have an increased degree of intracellular uptake of the molecules. Additionally, each system and method associated with PM dead-end filtration described herein may be used to increase the enrichment factor of permeabilized cells and the recovery percentage of permeabilized cells, for example altering the volumetric flow ratio and/or volumetric flow rate.",
