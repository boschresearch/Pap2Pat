                        "Groundwater-surface water interactions can create microhabitats that affect biological productivity in streams, wetland-stream systems, lakes, and the coastal ocean. Groundwater discharge to surface water can also be a significant source of solute mass that affects chemical mass budgets and local ecology. Unfortunately, it is typically quite difficult to characterize water flux across the sediment-aquifer boundary because of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability. Temporal variability in groundwater-surface water flux can be quite substantial, occurring over time scales of hours, days, weeks, seasons, and years.",
                        "Generally, there are three approaches to quantifying flow between aquifers and surface water bodies: (1) direct measurement; (2) hydrogeologic modeling; and (3) indirect measurement. Direct measurement techniques include both manual and automated seep meters. Manual meters are very labor intensive but they sample the flow directly through observing volume changes in an attached pre-filled bag. Because of low seepage rates and high labor requirements, sampling with manual seepage meters generally occurs over a few days with each sample representing an integrated flow over several hours. Therefore, manual seep meters cannot resolve either very short or long term temporal seepage patterns. Furthermore, factors associated with seep meter design (e.g., head loss through the collection chamber) and the external environment (e.g., waves and currents) can affect results and lead to large uncertainties. Automated seep meters may overcome many of the problems associated with manual meters, are less labor-intensive, and allow for better temporal resolution of seepage. However, they tend to be expensive, have high power requirements, and are subject to biofouling and therefore need frequent maintenance while deployed. Consequently, they too are not suited for measuring long-term seepage patterns.",
                        "Hydrogeologic modeling of groundwater-surface water interactions can take several different forms depending on the available data and scale of interest: Darcy's law, water budgets, hydrograph separation, and numerical modeling have all been used to calculate water fluxes. Darcy's law calculations can be used locally to determine the flux between two locations or can be used more regionally to determine large-scale flow through a system. Similarly, water budgets and hydrograph separation techniques lead to flow estimates over larger scales. Regional estimates of flow do not provide details within small spatial scales, such as within the hyporheic zone or shallow tidally-induced flow, where many important biogeochemical processes occur. Numerical models can be used for both large and small scale studies and can accommodate temporal variability. While such models offer a wider ability to characterize surface water\u2014groundwater interactions, they can only be as good as the data used to build them and they require significant field data. Hence, numerical modeling, while potentially powerful, can be limited by data needs.",
                        "Indirect flux estimation techniques measure independent variables from which flux is calculated and typically include some type of natural tracer. The mass balance tracer methods result in spatially integrated flux estimates and therefore do not provide spatial variability information. In addition, spatial and temporal variability in groundwater tracer concentrations can lead to significant uncertainties in the resulting flux estimates. Inverse modeling using one or more tracers can provide point estimates that can be difficult to use for large-scale flow estimation when spatial heterogeneity is high. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in the modeling because many hydrogeologic parameters, such as permeability, dispersivity, porosity, and anisotropy, are all unknown yet must be included in the model. Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems and methods for measuring and quantifying flow between aquifer and surface water bodies."

                        "Water and solute mass flux across the groundwater\u2014surface water interface can play a significant role in biogeochemical processes and is an important component of the hydrologic cycle. This flux can be difficult to quantify because of significant spatial and temporal variability in fluid flow and solute concentrations. The sensor may be particularly useful for characterizing spatial trends in groundwater\u2014surface water interactions in locations that are difficult to access either because of remoteness or because of obstacles. In some embodiments, sensors that can continuously operate in harsh environmental conditions, such as winter conditions, without needing maintenance, may be useful.",
                        "The sensor may also be useful for characterizing temporal or long-term trends in groundwater\u2014surface water interactions. In particular, sensors that can continuously and automatically measure groundwater\u2014surface water interactions over a multitude of time scales ranging from several months to several seasons may be useful. Such long-term measurements are valuable because of large observed imbalances between fluid flows between aquifers and surface water bodies, which cannot be explained by short-term fluid flux measurements. For example, in winter, because of changes in water table elevation, the interface between fresh water and salt water may shift landward resulting in a large fluid flux into aquifers. In contrast, during summer, the interface shifts away from land, which may result in a large fluid flux out of aquifers. Short term measurements may be unable to quantify this seasonal imbalance. Accordingly, the systems and methods described here may be particularly useful for characterizing water flux between an aquifer and a surface water body over time periods of several months or seasons. An in-situ sensor is described here that automatically measures and records the differential pressure between two locations and the electrical conductivity and temperature of both water bodies over long time scales ranging from several months to several seasons.",
                        "In one embodiment, the sensor records differential pressure between a surface water body and shallow groundwater. In some embodiments, the pressure difference between any two points within the shallow subsurface may be recorded by the sensor. The sensor is low-cost and designed to operate for long time periods without manual intervention. In some embodiments, the sensor is designed to continuously operate in harsh environmental conditions, such as winter conditions, without needing maintenance.",
                        "Actual deployment time may depend on several variables, including user-specified sampling frequency. The sensor may be deployed for at least 6 months with an approximately 15-minute sampling interval for differential pressure and an approximately 3-hour sampling interval for temperature and electrical conductivity (EC). The latter two parameters can be used in variable-density settings, such as the coastal ocean or inland saltwater lakes, to calculate forced gravitational convection. In some embodiments, temperature and EC could be used as tracers to calculate hydraulic parameters within the sediment. The collected data may be used with Darcy's law to estimate water flux between the two measurement points. In some embodiments the sensor is anchored to the sediment floor and away from surface hazards such as boats and winter ice.",
                        "Although the application described herein is for vertical flow across the sediment-water boundary, the differential pressure sensor may also be used to measure the differential pressure between any two saturated locations; useful for determining horizontal or vertical flow and/or monitoring gradients within shallow groundwater systems such as wetlands, seepage faces, or hyporheic zones, for example.",

Designing electronics to accurately amplify, digitize, and record signals with accuracy in the one part per thousand range is relatively easy.",
                        "External field conditions such as waves can result in instantaneous DP measurements that do not reflect average DP conditions. In order to minimize the effect of waves on the DP measurements, the sensor may be programmed to take an average of up to 256 differential pressure readings over roughly 30 seconds, which allows differential pressure sampling across many waves such that an accurate average pressure difference is obtained.",
                        "In addition to errors associated with instrument measurements, there are model errors associated with the flux calculations. In particular, a model must be chosen to represent fluid density as a function of elevation. By determining salinity at two locations, the salinity and density profiles may be constrained with the assumption of a salinity-depth model. A full discussion of model errors is beyond the scope of this description, but it has been determined that in an extreme case this error is \u02dc\u00b10.4 mm H2O per psu salinity difference between surface water and groundwater. In practice, the error is likely much lower and can be reduced considerably by direct sampling in the interval between the two sensor intakes.",

As in the first configuration, the pump 210 remains off to avoid disturbing the measurement process. The differential pressure measured in this configuration by the DP sensor 206 is representative of its calibration offset error. By subtracting this calibration offset error from the surface water-groundwater differential pressure reading, instantaneous zero errors from all sources, including drift and orientation, may be eliminated.",
                        "Zero, or null-offset, error may be a significant source of error in pressure sensors. This represents variations in the null output of the sensor (electrical output produced when the pressure at the two ports is equal) due to changes in forcing and/or ambient conditions such as temperature.

Chart 500 shows a DP measurement curve 502, a water flux curve 504, and a tide curve 506. As the tide rises and falls, reflected in the rises and falls of the tide curve 506, the water flux between the surface water and the groundwater, reflected in the water flux curve 504, changes accordingly. For example, at high tide, water flux tends to be positive, indicating that water is flowing from the surface water body into the aquifer. This is because at high tide, the level of the surface water body is higher, resulting in a higher surface water pressure at the surface water-groundwater interface, which drives water into the aquifer. In contrast, at lower tides, when the level of the surface water body is lower, the surface water pressure at the interface is lower, which may result in water flow from the aquifer into the surface water body, or a negative water flux as depicted in chart 500. The DP measurement curve 502 was used to calculate the water flux curve 504 according to equation (3).",
