    "title": "Immune checkpoints PVR and PVRL2 are prognostic markers in AML and their blockade represents a new therapeutic option",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoints are promising targets in cancer therapy. Recently, poliovirus receptor (PVR) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) have been identified as novel immune checkpoints. In this investigation we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and AML patient samples highly express the T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) ligands PVR and PVRL2. Using two independent patient cohorts, we could demonstrate that high PVR and PVRL2 expression correlates with poor outcome in AML. We show for the first time that antibody blockade of PVR or PVRL2 on AML cell lines or primary AML cells or TIGIT blockade on immune cells increases the anti-leukemic effects mediated by PBMCs or purified CD3+ cells in vitro. The cytolytic activity of the BiTE\u00ae antibody construct AMG 330 against leukemic cells could be further enhanced by blockade of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis. This increased immune reactivity is paralleled by augmented secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells. Employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PVR and PVRL2 in MV4-11 cells, the cytotoxic effects of antibody blockade could be recapitulated in vitro. In NSG mice reconstituted with human T cells and transplanted with either MV4-11 PVR/PVRL2 knockout or wildtype cells, prolonged survival was observed for the knockout cells. This survival benefit could be further extended by treating the mice with AMG 330. Therefore, targeting the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis with blocking antibodies might represent a promising future therapeutic option in AML.",

                "Escape of neoplastic cells from immune destruction has recently been added to the list of hallmarks of cancer [1]. But, effector lymphocytes may acquire an exhausted phenotype during the course of the disease, preventing efficient tumor rejection [2, 3].",
                "Inhibition of T-cell activation is accomplished by several receptor/ligand systems involved in checkpoint control of T-cell effector functions such as CTLA-4/CD80 and CD86 or PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2. Recently, therapeutic antibodies have been developed that inhibit these checkpoints resulting in reactivation of a cytotoxic phenotype. Clinical trials showed that CTLA-4 blocking antibodies ipilimumab or tremelimumab induced prolonged remissions in patients with malignant melanoma [4]. Antibodies against PD-1 such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab showed clinical activity in different tumor types including melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, renal, bladder and lung cancer [5, 6]. Currently, much effort is being directed toward the identification of novel immune checkpoint inhibitors [7].",
                "A second class of immunotherapeutic agents are the bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE\u00ae). BiTE\u00ae antibodies possess binding sites for CD3 on T cells and for tumor antigens, bringing neoplastic cells and T cells in close contact to induce their cytolytic action. Blinatumomab, a CD19/CD3 BiTE\u00ae, is the most advanced member in this class, and it is FDA and EMA approved for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [8]. For the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), AMG 330, a CD33/CD3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct, has shown preclinical activity and is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical testing (NCT02520427) [9, 10]. Combining both approaches, tumor cell killing by T cells in the presence of BiTE\u00ae antibody constructs, as well as blockade of checkpoint molecules may result in enhanced therapeutic efficacy.",
                "In the present investigation, we explored the therapeutic potential of inhibition of the novel immune regulators poliovirus receptor (PVR, CD155, Tage 4) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2, CD112, Nectin-2, PRR2), which bind to the CD28 family member T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). TIGIT is a type I transmembrane protein with an Ig variable extracellular domain expressed on activated and memory T cells, regulatory T cells, as well as NK and NKT cells [11, 12]. Upon ligand interaction, TIGIT suppresses the immune response through its cytosolic immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT)-like phosphorylation motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) [13, 14]. PVR has been initially described as the poliovirus binding site and was linked to blood cells being an extraneural site for poliovirus replication [15, 16]. PVR is overexpressed by some tumor entities including melanoma, glioblastoma, colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma [17\u201320].",
                "In our study, we analyzed the expression of TIGIT ligands PVR and PVRL2 on AML cell lines and patient samples and exploited the potential of this axis for the treatment of AML. For the first time, we show that blocking the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis augments T-cell mediated lysis of AML cells and additionally enhances the cytotoxic effects of the CD33/CD3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct AMG 330."

                        "The therapeutic potential of blocking the novel immune checkpoint molecules PVR and PVRL2 on leukemic blasts was examined in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. The specific lysis of AML cells by HD-PBMCs in the presence or absence of blocking PVR/PVRL2 antibodies is depicted as the mean fold change of dead target cells normalized to the control without blocking antibodies for the cell lines TF-1, Molm-13 and Kasumi-1 (Fig. 2a\u2013c). Since in MV4-11 cells only, a cytotoxic effect of the PVR and PVRL2 antibodies could be observed in the absence of HD-PBMCs (see Supplemental Fig. 2), we repeated the cytotoxicity assays using MV4-11 and TF-1 cells in the presence of a blocking anti-TIGIT antibody to replace the PVR/PVRL2 antibodies. Cell kill could be significantly augmented in both tested cell lines, indicating the importance of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis as immune checkpoints (Fig. 2d, e).Fig. 2Blocking of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis increases the lysis of AML cell lines. HD-PBMC-mediated lysis, with subject to the blocking of PVR and PVRLs on AML cell lines TF-1 (a, n\u2009=\u20093), Molm-13 (b, n\u2009=\u20096), Kasumi-1 (c, n\u2009=\u20093), was measured after 24\u2009h. The effect of blocking the receptor TIGIT on effector cells was examined for the cell lines TF-1 (d, n\u2009=\u20095) and MV4-11 (e, n\u2009=\u20093). Results are depicted as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD fold changes (FC) of dead target cells, relative to the control without blocking antibodies. Measurements were performed in technical triplicates and for statistical analysis Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests were performed (#p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; *p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001)",
                        "Further, we analyzed whether the T-cell mediated cytotoxicity exerted by AMG 330 could be enhanced by blocking PVR and PVRL2 or TIGIT. TF-1, Molm-13 or Kasumi-1 cells were incubated with HD-PBMCs or purified T cells for 24\u2009h with or without 0.1\u2009ng/mL AMG 330 in the presence or absence of PVR and PVRL2 blocking antibodies. Additionally, the killing of the cell lines MV4-11 and TF-1 was also investigated in the presence or absence of the anti-TIGIT antibody. As shown in Fig. 3a, the cytotoxic effect of AMG 330 was significantly increased by the administration of PVR or PVRL2 blocking antibodies using TF-1 cells (Fig. 3a). Significantly enhanced killing in comparison to the control could be detected after blocking PVR, PVRL2 or both antigens for the cell line Molm-13, although only moderate differences could be observed between all treatment arms (Fig. 3b). For Kasumi-1, only the PVR blocking antibody was able to induce a noteworthy enhancement of the cell lysis mediated by AMG 330 (Fig. 3c). The additional effect of blocking PVRL2 was neglectable in spite of high expression of PVRL2 on the cell line (Figs. 1, 3c). Employing the anti-TIGIT antibody, the effects of AMG 330 were augmented in a comparable manner (Fig. 3d, e). To exclude the effects of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), control experiments were performed. These included the use of an irrelevant antibody on c-kit (CD117) positive Kasumi-1 cells, and utilizing purified T cells as effectors (Supplemental Fig. S3 and S4 and Fig. 3f). Both controls emphasize the independence of ADCC in this context. To further investigate the T-cell mediated killing of target cells, we measured Granzyme B concentrations in the supernatants after incubation of TF-1 and MV4-11 with HD-PBMCs and antibodies against PVR, PVRL2, their combination or TIGIT. A significant increase in Granzyme B concentration was detected by the addition of blocking antibodies with or without AMG 330 (Fig. 4a\u2013f, for a time course employing TF-1 cells see Supplemental Fig. S5).Fig. 3T-cell mediated lysis of the BiTE\u00ae antibody construct AMG 330 is significantly enhanced by additional administration of PVR and PVRL2 or TIGIT blocking antibodies. TF-1 (a, n\u2009=\u20093), Molm-13 (b, n\u2009=\u20096), Kasumi-1 (c, n\u2009=\u20096) cells were incubated with HD-PBMCs and AMG 330 in the presence or absence of blocking antibodies against PVR or PVRL2. Blocking the receptor TIGIT on immune cells showed similar results for the cell line TF-1 (d, n\u2009=\u20095) and MV4-11 (e, n\u2009=\u20093). Results are depicted as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD fold change (FC) of dead target cells, relative to the control without blocking antibodies. Lysis is mediated via CD3+ cells, as comparing HD-PBMCs and purified CD3+ cells from the same donor showed comparable results using the cell line TF-1 (f, n\u2009=\u20092). Results are depicted as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of dead target cells of two independent experiments.

Cells harboring the double-knockout of PVR and PVRL2 on protein level were sorted by FACS (Supplemental Fig. S7). Furthermore, we analyzed the CRISPR/Cas9-induced genetic modifications resulting in the protein knockout in a number of single clones (Supplemental Fig. S8). The PVR and PVRL2 double-knockout cells were compared to their wildtype counterparts in cytotoxicity assays. In this setting, significantly enhanced killing of the double-knockout cells either by HD-PBMCs or purified T cells could be detected (Fig. 6a, b). This effect also resulted in higher secretion of Granzyme B during the kill of the double-knockout cells vs. the wildtype cells (data not shown). Addition of AMG 330 led again to a further significant increased cell lysis of the PVR and PVRL2 double-knockout cells compared to MV4-11 wildtype cells, indicating an augmented effect of combining both treatment approaches (Fig. 6a, b).Fig. 6PVR and PVRL2 double-knockout cells recapitulate antibody effects in vitro and prolong the survival of NSG mice reconstituted with human T cells in vivo. By using CRISPR/Cas9, a polyclonal population of MV4-11 harboring double-knockout cells of PVR and PVRL2 was generated.

Patient characteristics are summarized in Supplemental Table S1. PVR and PVRL2 expression was found in 94% and 95% of AML patients, respectively.

                "Cancer immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoint receptor/ligand interactions is one of the most successful approaches in cancer therapy in the last years. Although blocking the signaling pathways of PD-1 or CTLA-4 showed clinical success, the majority of treated patients still responded poorly, emphasizing the need for additional strategies [23]. To our knowledge, with this study, we are the first to provide evidence on the therapeutic potential of blocking the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis for the treatment of AML. We show that AML cell lines as well as AML cells from untreated patients express PVR and PVRL2 to a high extent. The cytotoxic effects of effector cells were significantly enhanced in vitro by blocking these molecules on AML cell lines and primary blasts with antibodies against both ligands or against TIGIT on T cells. Moreover, by using this approach, the anti-leukemic effects of the BiTE\u00ae antibody construct AMG 330 were augmented. We demonstrate that these effects are independent of ADCC and specific to the blocking of PVR, PVRL2 or TIGIT. In line with these findings, MV4-11 cells lacking PVR and PVRL2 were more prone to cell lysis than MV4-11 wildtype cells in vitro, and prolonged the survival of NSG mice reconstituted with human T cells either with or without BiTE\u00ae antibody construct therapy. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced cytotoxicity of T cells is accompanied by increased release of Granzyme B. Most importantly, our analysis of two independent patient cohorts revealed that high PVR and PVRL2 expression was associated with a negative prognosis in AML implying immune evasion in these patients. Therefore, these novel immune regulators should be evaluated as targets for the treatment of AML.",
                "BiTE\u00ae antibody constructs are investigated in a wide variety of solid and hematopoietic malignancies. The interaction of BiTE\u00ae antibody constructs with the target cancer cell leads to the formation of a T cell/target cell interaction, with the advantage of being independent of MHC class I interaction [24]. It has been shown that T-cell ligands influence the cytolytic activity of the BiTE\u00ae antibody construct AMG 330, where activating receptor/ligand interactions (e.g., CD28 with CD80/CD86) augmented and inhibitory ligand expression (e.g., PD-L1/PD-L2) impaired the cytotoxic activity of AMG 330 [25]. In agreement with these findings, the antibody blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis reversed a T-cell-induced immune escape mechanism by enhancing the lysis of AML cells during AMG 330 treatment ex vivo [26]. Moreover, in a recent clinical case report, the possibility of resistance against the CD19/CD3 BiTE\u00ae antibody construct blinatumomab due to increased PD-L1 expression was described [27]. Considering the results of our study, we identified another important immune regulatory escape mechanism in AML, which serves as an attractive target for monotherapy as well as for combined administration with AMG 330.",
                "In this report we show a high protein expression of the TIGIT ligands PVR and PVRL2 on AML cell lines and on most of the analysed CD33+ primary AML blasts. PVR and PVRL2 are physiologically expressed on hematopoietic cells and might be further upregulated by cancer cells as a mechanism of immune escape, whereas in AML, PD-L1 is not constitutively expressed, but upregulated by treatment with hypomethylating agents or during BiTE\u00ae antibody construct therapy [26, 28\u201330]. Two clinical studies have been recently presented in abstract form combining nivolumab with azacytidine or intensive chemotherapy, respectively. Here, additional immunotherapy targeting PD-1 resulted in only moderate improvement of the expected response rates [31, 32]. This favors the selection of PVR and PVRL2 as therapeutic targets over other immune checkpoints.",
                "The exact mechanism by which PVR and PVRL2 exert their immunosuppressive function is still subject of debate. Both are also ligands to DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1, CD226), which has immune activating properties for NK cells and T cells, promoting tumor cell lysis [33\u201335]. In analogy to the co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor pair CD28 and CTLA-4, respectively, sharing the ligands CD80 and CD86, competitive binding of PVR to DNAM-1 or TIGIT has been proposed [36]. PVR and PVRL2 bind to the activating receptor DNAM-1 with low affinity and to the suppressing receptor TIGIT with high affinity. Additionally, CD96 has been identified on immune cells as a negative regulator of immune response competing with DNAM-1 for the common ligand PVR [37]. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence for the immunological importance of CD8+ effector function regulated by TIGIT. Johnston et al. showed that anti-viral and anti-tumor effector functions of CD8+ T cells are negatively regulated by TIGIT [38]. In our study, we describe that PVR and PVRL2 are important immune regulators for the immune surveillance of AML and that antibody blockade of these molecules augments anti-leukemic effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Our findings are in line with a recent report in which melanoma cells expressing PVR control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the interaction between TIGIT and PVR in the effector phase by a suppression of cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTL [18].",
                "Our results highlight the importance of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis for the prognosis of AML patients under standard chemotherapy, implying that immune effects are also operational in this setting, since a high PVR and PVRL2 expression correlated with shorter overall survival in two independent patient cohorts. These results are strongly supported by a recent report stating that TIGIT contributes to functional T-cell impairment and that high TIGIT expression on T cells from AML patients correlates with poor clinical outcome [39]. Interestingly, a number of additional studies report a prognostic relevance for PVR in several tumor entities. Although no detectable immunohistological staining for PVR was found in normal tissue, PVR expression was elevated in some primary tumors including colorectal, prostate, renal and pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma as well as glioblastoma [17\u201320]. In support of our findings regarding the clinical significance for PVR and PVRL2 expression in AML, in pancreatic cancer patients, a high PVR expression also represented an independent prognostic factor for overall survival [20].",
                "TIGIT is described as the dominant negative receptor with high affinity for PVR and low affinity for PVRL2 [11]. To our knowledge, all published studies concentrate on the impact of PVR on cancer outcome, whereas our findings highlight the equal importance of PVRL2 in this setting. This statement is espoused by the recent discovery of the novel inhibitory checkpoint receptor on human T cells, CD112R, which binds PVRL2. The authors show that disruption of this interaction enhances the human T-cell response [40]. As a third inhibitory receptor competing with DNAM-1 for ligands, the immune suppressive features of PVR and PVRL2 outweigh the immune stimulating properties. Moreover, in immune cells with exhausted phenotypes DNAM-1 is downregulated and might therefore not be able to display its role as immune activator [39, 41, 42]. Interestingly, the high expression of TIGIT on CD8+ T cells from AML patients observed by Kong and colleagues was inversely correlated to low DNAM-1 expression levels [39]. These findings might explain why immune stimulatory properties predominate upon blockade of PVR and PVRL2, as shown in our study.",
                "Our preclinical findings indicate that the disruption of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis might be of therapeutic value in patients. In this regard, a phase I and a phase I/II clinical study investigating the safety and tolerability of a TIGIT blocking antibody for the treatment of advanced and metastatic solid tumors is recruiting patients (NCT02913313 and NCT02794571). In addition, studies show that the inhibition of an immune response in cancer is often mediated via several receptors. In line with this, the combined administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab to patients with advanced melanoma resulted in a significantly prolonged RFS, compared to ipilimumab alone [43]. In multiple preclinical cancer models including AML, TIGIT expression was strongly associated with expression of other co-inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3, indicating the potential need for targeting multiple checkpoints in AML treatment [44, 45]. As shown in our study, the blocking of PVR and PVRL2 combined with other promising immunological approaches like BiTE\u00ae antibody construct therapies might be beneficial for cancer treatment [46, 47]."
