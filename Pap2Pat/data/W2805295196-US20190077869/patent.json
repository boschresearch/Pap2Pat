                        "Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic anti-tumor immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune-checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage.",
                        "In general, T cells do not respond to these ligand-receptor interactions unless they first recognize their cognate antigen through the TCR. Many of the ligands bind to multiple receptors, some of which deliver co-stimulatory signals and others deliver inhibitory signals. In general, pairs of co-stimulatory-inhibitory receptors that bind the same ligand or ligands\u2014such as CD28 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4)\u2014display distinct kinetics of expression with the co-stimulatory receptor expressed on naive and resting T cells, but the inhibitory receptor is commonly upregulated after T cell activation. One important family of membrane-bound ligands that bind both co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors is the B7 family. All of the B7 family members and their known ligands belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Many of the receptors for more recently identified B7 family members have not yet been identified. TNF family members that bind to cognate TNF receptor family molecules represent a second family of regulatory ligand-receptor pairs. These receptors predominantly deliver co-stimulatory signals when engaged by their cognate ligands.",
                        "Another major category of signals that regulate the activation of T cells comes from soluble cytokines in the microenvironment. Communication between T cells and APCs is bidirectional. In some cases, this occurs when ligands themselves signal to the APC. In other cases, activated T cells upregulate ligands, such as CD40L, that engage cognate receptors on APCs.",
                        "However, tumors co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumor antigens. Because many of the immune-checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions, they can be blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. CTLA4 antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve FDA approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1, indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.",
                        "Cancer immunotherapy thus also focuses on the development of agents that can render neoplastic and cancer cells more amenable to killing by the immune system, particularly by T cells. This can, for example, be achieved by interfering with immune checkpoint proteins, either with ligands or receptors or both. Although the knowledge for immune-checkpoint molecules as well as the knowledge which immune-checkpoint molecules are used by which cancer cells increases, it is not known which of them may be used by which neoplastic and then cancer cells to evade the immune system, thereby gaining the capability of uncontrolled growth. For example, blood-borne cancers, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are meanwhile known to evade the immune system. Though it is speculated that immune-checkpoint proteins may be involved, there is not yet proof for this. There is thus an unmet need to provide means and methods for overriding the influence of immune-checkpoint proteins in order to make blood-borne cancer cells more amenable to access of the killing machinery of the immune system.",
                        "Accordingly, the technical problem underlying the present application is to satisfy this unmet need, i.e. to provide means and methods for making blood-borne cancer cells, particularly AML cells more amenable to killing by the body's immune system. The solution is, in general, the provision of inhibitors of the immune-checkpoint ligands CD112, CD155, their receptor TIGIT, the immune-checkpoint ligand Galectin-9 and/or its receptor TIM-3 for the treatment of blood-borne cancers, in particular AML. Said solution is also reflected in the claims, embodied in the description, exemplified in the appended Examples and illustrated in the Figures."

                        "The present invention relates to compounds that modulate the immune system for use in the treatment of blood-borne cancers, such as lymphoma or leukemia, particularly AML. Moreover, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said immunomodulating compounds and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells). Further, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising said immunomodulating compounds and an antibody construct capable of engaging T cells.",
                        "In this regard the present invention pays attention to the need of providing new immune-checkpoints in blood-borne cancer therapy, particularly AML therapy that can be influenced by diverse inhibitors in order to treat cancer cells that have developed immune escape mechanisms. In particular, the present inventors discovered CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and TIM-3 as new immune-checkpoints proteins that can be specifically targeted for therapy of blood-borne cancers, particularly AML. Thereby, inhibitors against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 lead to a significantly increased cell lysis of AML cells. Additionally, the inventors discovered that the impact of said immune-checkpoint inhibitors may be even more effective when combined with chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR T cells) or antibody constructs capable of engaging T cells, such as the bispecific T-cell-engaging (BiTE) antibody construct AMG 330 having dual specificity for CD3 and CD33. Thus, the compounds and composition of the present invention allow for a novel therapeutic option for patients with blood-borne cancer, in particular AML thereby providing a promising way for making blood-borne cancer cells more amenable to killing by the body's defense. Accordingly, the present invention indicates broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumor immunity and provides compounds and composition that seem to have the potential to achieve durable clinical responses.",
                        "In a first aspect, the present invention relates to an inhibitor against CD112 (Nectin-2, PVRL2), CD155 (PVR), Galectin-9, TIM-3 and/or TIGIT for use in a method of treatment of blood-borne cancers, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A first group of such an inhibitor inhibits the interaction between immune-check point protein ligands and receptors as described herein.

It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against TIM-3 inhibits the interaction between TIM-3 and Galectin-9. The inhibitor of the present invention can be an antibody construct.",
                        "It is also envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention can further comprise a CAR T cell. The inhibitor of the present invention can also comprise an antibody construct that is capable of engaging T cells. The antibody construct capable of engaging T cells preferably comprises a CD3 binding domain and a further binding domain targeting a surface molecule expressed on AML cells. Said surface molecule may be selected from the group consisting of CD33, CD19, and Flt3. The antibody construct capable of engaging T cells is preferably a binding molecule capable of binding to CD3epsilon. The inhibitor of the present invention may further comprise an immunostimulant.",
                        "A further group of immune-checkpoint inhibitors reduces expression of immune checkpoint proteins as described herein. Accordingly, it is thus envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against CD112 reduces expression of CD112. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against CD155 reduces expression of CD155. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against TIGIT reduces expression of TIGIT. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against Galectin-9 increases expression of Galectin-9. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against TIM3 increases expression of TIM-3. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention is an iRNA. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention knocks out CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3. The knock-out may be achieved by CRISPR/cas9 technique.",
                        "Another group of immune-checkpoint inhibitors modulates intracellular signaling of the immune-checkpoint proteins as described herein. It is thus envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against CD112 modulates intracellular signaling of CD112. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against CD155 modulates intracellular signaling of CD155. It is envisaged that the inhibitor of the present invention against TIGIT modulates intracellular signaling of TIGIT.

It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed inventions, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.",
                        "The present invention is at least partly based on the surprising finding that immune-checkpoint inhibitors against CD112 (Nectin-2, PVRL2), CD155 (PVR), Galectin-9, TIM-3 and/or TIGIT can be efficiently used for the treatment of blood-borne cancers, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML) having immune escape mechanisms, thereby providing a new and very efficient immunotherapeutic approach in cancer therapy. In this regard the inventors discovered in in vitro studies with various leukemic cell lines that the immune-checkpoint ligands CD112 and CD155 and their receptor TIGIT, the immune-checkpoint ligand Galectin-9 and its receptor TIM-3 are well suited targets for the treatment of blood-borne cancers, in particular AML. CD112 are CD155 immune-checkpoint protein ligands, while their receptor is TIGIT. Galectin-9 is also a ligand and TIM-3 its receptor.",
                        "It was found by the present inventors that the immune-checkpoint ligands PVR and PVRL2 and its receptor TIGIT seem to have negative prognostic impact on the overall survival in AML patients (data not shown). Moreover, the present inventors revealed that blockage of PVL, PVRL2 or TIGIT leads to a significant killing of AML cells (FIGS. 3-13). Accordingly, the present inventors paid attention to PVR, PVRL2 and TIGIT as a new targets in blood-born cancer treatment, particularly AML treatment and provide substances that efficiently inhibit the immunoinhibitory signal of PVR, PVRL2 and/or TIGIT, thereby inhibiting cancer proliferation through the mechanism of the recovery and activation of immune function of T cells. Further, there are contradictory data in the art describing positive as well as negative prognostic impact of the immune-checkpoint ligand Galectin-9 and its receptor TIM-3 on T cell activity and tumor development. Although expression studies seem to underline that Galectin-9 and TIM-3 have a rather positive prognostic impact on cancer patients (data not shown), the present inventors revealed that blockage of Galectin-9 and TIM-3 leads to a significant killing of AML cells (see FIGS. 14 and 15). Accordingly, the present invention further provides substances that efficiently inhibit the immunoinhibitory signal of Galectin-9/TIM-3-interaction, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation through recovery and activation of T cells.",
                        "As shown by the present inventors, all examined AML cell lines are about 100% positive for PVR and PVRL2 protein expression. In contrast, only 52% and 40% of PBMCs from healthy donors express PVR and PVRL2, respectively (FIG. 1). Moreover, protein density for PVR and PVRL2 is very high compared to very low density on PBMCs. Further, Galectin-9 protein expression and density is low and comparable to PBMCs from healthy donors. Also primary blasts of AML patients show protein expression of PVR and PVRL2. Thereby, MNCs of de novo AML patients have been isolated and stained simultaneously for CD33 and PVR or PVRL2, respectively.

Preferred amino acid residues for a peptide linker include Gly, Ser and Thr are characterized by a length between 5 and 25 amino acid residues. Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,751,180 and 4,935,233 or WO 88/09344.

Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The CH domain most proximal to VH is designated as CH1. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. The VH and VL domains consist of four regions of relatively conserved sequences called framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4), which form a scaffold for three regions of hypervariable sequences (complementarity determining regions, CDRs). The CDRs contain most of the residues responsible for specific interactions of the antibody with the antigen. CDRs are referred to as CDR 1, CDR2, and CDR3.

Variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies; it is concentrated in sub-domains of each of the heavy and light chain variable regions. These sub-domains are called \u201chypervariable\u201d regions or \u201ccomplementarity determining regions\u201d (CDRs). The more conserved (i.e., non-hypervariable) portions of the variable domains are called the \u201cframework\u201d regions (FRM). The variable domains of naturally occurring heavy and light chains each comprise four FRM regions, largely adopting a 8-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the 8-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRM and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site (see Kabat et al., loc. cit.).

CDRs contribute to the functional activity of an antibody molecule and are separated by amino acid sequences that comprise scaffolding or framework regions. The exact definitional CDR boundaries and lengths are subject to different classification and numbering systems. CDRs may therefore be referred to by Kabat, Chothia, contact or any other boundary definitions, including the numbering system described herein. Despite differing boundaries, each of these systems has some degree of overlap in what constitutes the so called \u201chypervariable regions\u201d within the variable sequences.

See for example Kabat, Chothia, and/or MacCallum (Kabat et a/., loc. cit.; Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol, 1987, 196: 901; and MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol, 1996, 262: 732). However, the numbering in accordance with the so-called Kabat system is preferred. The CDR3 of the light chain and, particularly, CDR3 of the heavy chain may constitute the most important determinants in antigen binding within the light and heavy chain variable regions. In some antibody constructs, the heavy chain CDR3 appears to constitute the major area of contact between the antigen and the antibody. In vitro selection schemes in which CDR3 alone is varied can be used to vary the binding properties of an antibody or determine which residues contribute to the binding of an antigen.",

An \u201cisolated\u201d protein is unaccompanied by at least some of the material with which it is normally associated in its natural state, for example constituting at least about 5%, or at least about 50% by weight of the total protein in a given sample. It is understood that the isolated protein may constitute from 5 to 99.9% by weight of the total protein content depending on the circumstances. For example, the protein may be made at a significantly higher concentration through the use of an inducible promoter or high expression promoter, such that the protein is made at increased concentration levels. The definition includes the production of an antigen binding protein in a wide variety of organisms and/or host cells that are known in the art.",

However any other substance that can inhibit the immunoinhibitory signal between CD112 and TIGIT, CD155 and TIGIT and/or Galectin-9 and TIM-3 will have similar effects. The substance with such effects include for example soluble CD112, soluble CD155, soluble TIGIT, soluble Galectin-9, soluble TIM-3, C112 antagonists, CD155 antagonists, TIGIT antagonists, Galectin-9 antagonists, TIM-3 antagonists, substances that inhibit interaction between CD112 and TIGIT, CD155 and TIGIT and/or Galectin-9 and TIM-3, CD112 production inhibitors, CD155 production inhibitors, TIGIT production inhibitors, TIGIT production inhibitors, TIM-3 production inhibitors, and intracellular inhibitory signal inhibitors by TIGIT or TIM-3.",

In this regard, proteins and polypeptides or derivatives that bind to CD112, CD15, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 include each partial proteins of D112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 or TIM-3 of which the immunoinhibiting signal between CD112 and TIGIT, CD155 and TIGIT and/or Galectin-9 and TIM-3 is not induced. The presence of TIGIT or TIM-3 in the neighborhood of the immune-checkpoint receptors is indispensable for the inducement of the immunoinhibitory signal of TIGIT or TIM-3, for that purpose it is restrained by the interaction with CD112, CD155 (TIGIT) or Galectin-9 (TIM-3) in tumors or carcinoma cells. Therefore, soluble CD112, CD155 or Galectin-9 with a part that is only extracellular domains and interacts with TIGIT or TIM-3 can inhibit the immunoinhibitory signal of CD112, CD155 or Galectin-9. ON the other hand, soluble TIGIT or TIM-3 with a part which has a similar structure and can interact with CD122, CD155 or Galectin-9 can inhibit the immunoinhibitory signal. These soluble proteins have only to include extracellular region which is necessary and sufficient to bind to CD122, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 or TIM-3 and can be prepared by a well-known expression and refining techniques.",

Further, an antagonist with stringer activity can be identified from molecular groups of which this polypeptide fragment is chemically modified, or designed by computer based on the spatial structure of the polypeptide fragment. Also, the best antagonist can be more efficiently selected from molecular groups designed by computer based on protein stereoanalysis data of the interaction area.",
                        "It is further envisaged, that the inhibitor for use in the treatment of a blood-borne cancer, particularly AML as disclosed herein is a small molecule inhibitor. The term \u201csmall molecule\u201d means a molecule with a low molecular weight, typically smaller than 1000 Da. Such a small molecule as used herein refers to beneficial agents having low molecular weight which are usually synthesized by organic chemistry, but may also be isolated from natural sources such as plants, fungi, and microbes. When used for the treatment of blood-borne cancers within the scope of the present invention, such small molecules are also termed as small molecule drugs. The common routes for delivering small molecule drugs are oral, injection, pulmonary, and transdermal.",

Likewise, the inhibitor of the present invention against CD155 reduces expression of CD155. Likewise, the inhibitor of the present invention against TIGIT reduces expression of TIGIT. Likewise, the inhibitor of the present invention against Galectin-9 reduces expression of Galectin-9. Likewise, the inhibitor of the present invention against TIM-3 reduces expression of TIM-3. Accordingly, further disclosed herein is the use of a nucleic acid sequence (e.g. a therapeutic nucleic acid molecule, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, a DNA encoding same, or a vector producing same) to prepare an antisense molecule suitable for reducing the expression of a target gene, e.g. the genes encoding for CD112, CD155, TIGIT Galectin-9 and TIM-3. The term \u201creduce expression\u201d when used herein refers to the ability of the inhibitor of the present invention to decrease or block expression of the target gene, i.e. the genes encoding for CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and TIM-3 in a specific and post-transcriptional manner. In this regard, the present invention relates to nucleotides capable of reducing the expression of CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 in cancer cells. Said nucleotides may characterized by sequence which targets the mRNA and by having at least 50% sequence identity, or at least 70% sequence identity, or at least 80% sequence identity, or at least 90% sequence identity with the target mRNA. Particularly useful for this purpose are RNA sequences which can be used to prepare a nucleotide-based inhibitor. RNA duplexes of 21-23 nucleotides, with \u02dc2 nucleotides 3\u2032 overhangs (called small interfering RNAs or siRNAs), have been shown to mediate sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression in mammalian cells via a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PIGS) mechanism termed RNA interference (RNAi). Accordingly, RNAi is considered as one of the most promising novel therapeutic strategies through the silencing of disease-causing genes in vivo. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the nucleotide capable of reducing the expression of CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 is an RNAi (iRNA). The person skilled in the art is aware of several techniques to synthetize RNAi and to deliver these constructs to tumor cells in vivo, thereby using e.g. liposomal formulations as described e.g. in Santel et al. 2006, Gene Therapy 13, 1360-1370. In this regard, double-stranded RNA is first synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a \u201cgene knockdown\u201d, to distinguish it from \u201chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout\u201d procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated.",

The term \u201cknock out\u201d when used herein refers to a complete reduction of the expression of at least a portion of a polypeptide encoded by an endogenous gene encoding for CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 of a single cell, selected cells, or all of the cells of a mammal, as compared to a wild type animal. The mammal may be a \u201cheterozygous knockout\u201d, wherein one allele of the endogenous gene has been disrupted. Alternatively, the mammal may be a \u201chomozygous knockout\u201d, wherein both alleles of the endogenous gene have been disrupted. It is also envisaged that more than one gene encoding for CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3, preferably two genes are \u201cknocked out\u201d. In this case the mammal is a \u201cdouble knocked out\u201d mammal. According to the present invention, the present inventors demonstrated that PVR and PVRL2 can be specifically single or double knocked out in AML cell lines when using CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Accordingly, the present invention also refers to an inhibitor against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 inhibitor that knocks out CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3, wherein said knock-out is achieved by CRISPR/cas9 technique. However, the skilled artisan is aware various different techniques applicable to knockout immune-checkpoints in blood-borne cancer cell, in particular AML cells. Knockout techniques within the scope of the present invention therefore comprise any of the techniques to alter a gene sequence that result in an inactivated gene, or one in which the expression can be inactivated at a chosen time during development resulting in the loss of function of a gene.",
                        "The immune-checkpoint inhibitor of the present invention can further comprise a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell. CAR T cells exhibit engineered receptors (chimeric antigen receptors) which graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T cell with transfer of their coding sequence facilitated by retroviral vectors. These CARs allow the T cell to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. According to the present invention, the CAR T cell preferably exhibits CARs that allow the T cell to recognize specific proteins on blood-borne cancer cells. Preferably, the CAR T cell of the present invention is capable to recognize CD33 on the surface of blood-borne cancer cells, in particular on AML cells. In this regard, the addition of CAR T cells directed to specific surface molecule expressed on blood-borne cancer cells such as CD33 can enhance the cytotoxic effect of inhibitors against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3. Accordingly, it is envisaged that the inhibitors of the present invention against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 comprise a CAR T cell. Said CAR T cell preferably comprises a binding domain targeting a surface molecule expressed on blood-borne cancer cells, in particular AML cells. Said surface molecule is preferably CD33, CD19, or Flt3. Accordingly, the inhibitor of the present invention may comprise a CAR T cell having a binding domain targeting CD33. The inhibitor of the present invention may further comprise a CAR T cell having a binding domain targeting CD19. The inhibitor of the present invention can also comprise a CAR T cell having a binding domain targeting Flt3.

Such antibody constructs engaging T cells are preferably bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE antibody constructs), i.e. bispecific antibodies that bind to a T cell antigen and a tumor antigen. BiTE antibody constructs have been shown to induce directed lysis of target tumor cells and thus also provide great potential therapies for cancers and other disorders. One possible approach is the bispecific T cell engaging antibody construct AMG330 with dual specificity for CD3 and the sialic acid-binding lectin CD33, which is frequently expressed on the surface of AML blasts and leukemic stem cells. AMG330 was developed for the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and will be evaluated in phase I studies shortly (Friedrich et al. 2014, American Association for Cancer Research, 1549-1557).",

A binding domain within the T cell engaging molecule/bispecific antibody may typically comprise an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH); however, it does not have to comprise both. Fd fragments, for example, have two VH regions and often retain some antigen-binding function of the intact antigen-binding domain. Additional examples for the format of antibody fragments, antibody variants or binding domains include (1) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment having the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (2) a F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (3) an Fd fragment having the two VH and CH1 domains; (4) an Fv fragment having the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (5) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which has a VH domain; (6) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR), and (7) a single chain Fv (scFv), the latter being preferred (for example, derived from an scFV-library).

Accordingly, it is envisaged that the inhibitors of the present invention against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 may further comprise an antibody construct capable of engaging T cells. Said antibody construct preferably comprises a CD3 binding domain and a further binding domain targeting a surface molecule expressed on blood-borne cancer cell, in particular AML cells.

White blood cells can be counted manually in hemocytometers (Neubauer chamber) or with automated counters. To determine the differential, a drop of blood can be thinly spread over a glass slide, air dried, and stained with a Romanofsky stain, most commonly the Wright or May-Grunewald-Giemsa technique. Cells are then counted and classified using morphologic examination and/or histochemistry as described in Blumenreich MS. The White Blood Cell and Differential Count. In: Walker H K, Hall W D, Hurst J W, editors. Clinical Methods: The History, Physicals, and Laboratory Examinations. 3rd edition. Boston: Butterworths; 1990. Chapter 153. Alternatively, leukocytes are isolated from a blood sample and stained with fluorescent-labeled antibodies against leucocyte cell surface markers and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry in order to calculate absolute cell numbers for each leukocyte subpopulation. Additionally or alternatively, it is also possible to evaluate the general appearance of the respective patient, which will also aid the skilled practitioner to evaluate whether the therapy is effective. Those skilled in the art are aware of numerous other ways which will enable a practitioner to observe a therapeutic effect of the compound for use in the treatment of blood-borne cancer, in particular AML as disclosed herein in the context of a method or use of the present invention.",

                        "Another major challenge in the development of drugs such as the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is the predictable modulation of pharmacokinetic properties. To this end, a pharmacokinetic profile of the drug candidate, i.e. a profile of the pharmacokinetic parameters that affect the ability of a particular drug to treat a given condition, can be established. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug influencing the ability of a drug for treating a certain disease entity include, but are not limited to: half-life, volume of distribution, hepatic first-pass metabolism and the degree of blood serum binding. The efficacy of a given drug agent can be influenced by each of the parameters mentioned above. \u201cHalf-life\u201d means the time where 50% of an administered drug are eliminated through biological processes, e.g. metabolism, excretion, etc. By \u201chepatic first-pass metabolism\u201d is meant the propensity of a drug to be metabolized upon first contact with the liver, i.e. during its first pass through the liver. \u201cVolume of distribution\u201d means the degree of retention of a drug throughout the various compartments of the body, like e.g. intracellular and extracellular spaces, tissues and organs, etc. and the distribution of the drug within these compartments. \u201cDegree of blood serum binding\u201d means the propensity of a drug to interact with and bind to blood serum proteins, such as albumin, leading to a reduction or loss of biological activity of the drug.",

                        "It has been surprisingly found in connection with the present invention that a combination of the inhibitor of the present invention and the bispecific antibody construct AMG330 significantly increases the cell lysis of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the cell lysis solely reduced by blocking antibodies against CD112 and CD155 alone (FIG. 3-13). This finding supports that the combination of an inhibitor against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 and a CD33, CD19 or Flt3 directed T cell engager would be synergistically more effective than either therapy administered separately. Accordingly, the described administration of one or more inhibitor against CD112, CD155, TIGIT, Galectin-9 and/or TIM-3 in combination with a CD33, CD19 or Flt3 directed T cell engager described herein may allow for lower doses of a bispecific T cell engager to be effective at a given time point. The redirected lysis of target cells via the recruitment of T cells by a multispecific, at least bispecific, construct involves cytolytic synapse formation and delivery of perforin and granzymes. The engaged T cells are capable of serial target cell lysis, and are not affected by immune escape mechanisms interfering with peptide antigen processing and presentation, or clonal T cell differentiation; see, for example, WO 2007/042261 or WO 2008/119567.",

                        "Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. Salts may be used in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention to, for example, adjust the ionic strength and/or the isotonicity of a formulation and/or to improve the solubility and/or physical stability of a protein or other ingredient of a composition in accordance with the invention. As is well known, ions can stabilize the native state of proteins by binding to charged residues on the protein's surface and by shielding charged and polar groups in the protein and reducing the strength of their electrostatic interactions, attractive, and repulsive interactions. Ions also can stabilize the denatured state of a protein by binding to, in particular, the denatured peptide linkages (\u2014CONH) of the protein. Furthermore, ionic interaction with charged and polar groups in a protein also can reduce intermolecular electrostatic interactions and, thereby, prevent or reduce protein aggregation and insolubility.",
                        "A number of categorical rankings of ions and their effects on proteins have been developed that can be used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention. One example is the Hofmeister series, which ranks ionic and polar non-ionic solutes by their effect on the conformational stability of proteins in solution. Stabilizing solutes are referred to as \u201ckosmotropic.\u201d Destabilizing solutes are referred to as \u201cchaotropic.\u201d Kosmotropes commonly are used at high concentrations (e.g., >1 molar ammonium sulfate) to precipitate proteins from solution (\u201csalting-out\u201d). Chaotropes commonly are used to denture and/or to solubilize proteins (\u201csalting-in\u201d). The relative effectiveness of ions to \u201csalt-in\u201d and \u201csalt-out\u201d defines their position in the Hofmeister series.",
                        "Free amino acids can be used in the formulations in accordance with various embodiments of the invention as bulking agents, stabilizers, and antioxidants, as well as other standard uses. Lysine, proline, serine, and alanine can be used for stabilizing proteins in a formulation. Glycine is useful in lyophilization to ensure correct cake structure and properties. Arginine may be useful to inhibit protein aggregation, in both liquid and lyophilized formulations. Methionine is useful as an antioxidant. Polyols include sugars, e.g., mannitol, sucrose, and sorbitol and polyhydric alcohols such as, for instance, glycerol and propylene glycol, and, for purposes of discussion herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and related substances. Polyols are kosmotropic. They are useful stabilizing agents in both liquid and lyophilized formulations to protect proteins from physical and chemical degradation processes. Polyols also are useful for adjusting the tonicity of formulations.",
                        "The formulations may further comprise one or more antioxidants. To some extent deleterious oxidation of proteins can be prevented in pharmaceutical formulations by maintaining proper levels of ambient oxygen and temperature and by avoiding exposure to light. Antioxidant excipients can be used as well to prevent oxidative degradation of proteins. Among useful antioxidants in this regard are reducing agents, oxygen/free-radical scavengers, and chelating agents. Antioxidants for use in therapeutic protein formulations in accordance with the invention preferably are water-soluble and maintain their activity throughout the shelf life of a product. EDTA is a preferred antioxidant in accordance with the invention in this regard.",
                        "Antioxidants can damage proteins. For instance, reducing agents, such as glutathione in particular, can disrupt intramolecular disulfide linkages. Thus, antioxidants for use in the invention are selected to, among other things, eliminate or sufficiently reduce the possibility of themselves damaging proteins in the formulation. Formulations in accordance with the invention may include metal ions that are protein co-factors and that are necessary to form protein coordination complexes, such as zinc necessary to form certain insulin suspensions. Metal ions also can inhibit some processes that degrade proteins. However, metal ions also catalyze physical and chemical processes that degrade proteins.",
                        "As might be expected, development of liquid formulations containing preservatives are more challenging than lyophilized formulations. Freeze-dried products can be lyophilized without the preservative and reconstituted with a preservative containing diluent at the time of use. This shortens the time for which a preservative is in contact with the protein, significantly minimizing the associated stability risks. With liquid formulations, preservative effectiveness and stability should be maintained over the entire product shelf-life (about 18 to 24 months). An important point to note is that preservative effectiveness should be demonstrated in the final formulation containing the active drug and all excipient components.",
                        "Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, crystal, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration. The invention also provides kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. In certain embodiments of this invention, kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are provided.

In certain embodiments, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 \u03bcg/kg to up to about 30 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In specific embodiments, the dosage may range from 1.0 \u03bcg/kg up to about 20 mg/kg, optionally from 10 \u03bcg/kg up to about 10 mg/kg or from 100 \u03bcg/kg up to about 5 mg/kg.",

                                "Samples from 140 treatment naive patients with newly diagnosed AML (AMLSG 07-04, NCT00151242) were analyzed by RT-qPCR for expression of the immune checkpoint molecules PVR, PVRL2 and Galectin-9 (Gal-9). Expression was correlated with patient demographics (age, karyotype, FLT3 mutation status) and clinical survival data by multivariate cox regression. The majority of patients showed mRNA expression of PVR (94%), PVRL2 (95%) and Gal-9 (92%). In a multivariate stepwise cox regression for overall survival, an unfavorable karyotype, high PVR and high Gal-9 expression were identified as independent prognostic markers (p<0.001, HR: 2.10, CI 1.39-3.15 for the karyotype; p=0.001, HR: 1.64, CI 1.21-2.21 for PVR and p<0.001, HR: 0.67, CI 0.54-0.84 for Gal-9). Due to a high correlation between PVR and PVRL2 (Pearson's rho=0.827, p<0.001), PVRL2 was removed during the stepwise process. Nevertheless, if PVR was excluded from the multivariate cox regression, PVRL2 remained as significant term in the stepwise procedure in addition to the karyotype and Gal-9 (p=0.003, HR: 1.58, CI 1.17-2.13 for PVRL2). In a second, independent patient cohort containing microarray-based gene expression and clinical data of 291 AML patients (Verhaak et. al., Haematologica 2009; 94) a high PVR and PVRL2 expression in contrast to expression of CD80, CD86 or PD-L1 was associated with poor overall survival (log-rank test p=0.003 and p=0.032, respectively). In in vitro killing assays the therapeutic effect of PVR and PVRL2 blockade was studied by FACS using 7-AAD staining. AML cell lines MV4-11, Kasumi-1 and Molm-13 were preincubated with blocking antibodies against PVR, PVRL2 or both and co-cultured for 24 h with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors in the presence or absence of AMG 330.",
                                "In the absence of AMG 330, the cell kill of MV4-11 increased from 12.6\u00b14.7% (control) to 33.0\u00b18.8% (PVR), to 40.4\u00b110.4% (PVRL2) and to 56.0\u00b112.0% (both PVR+PVRL2). In the presence of suboptimal concentration of AMG 330 (0.1 ng/ml MV4-11 cell lysis was 29.4\u00b19.0% (AMG 330 alone), 49.7\u00b112.6% (AMG 330+PVR), 57.9\u00b111.3% (AMG 330+PVRL2) and 70.0\u00b19.8% (AMG 330+PVR+PVRL2; n=4, p<0.05 for all comparisons). Comparable results were found for Kasumi-1 and Molm-13 with blockade of both checkpoint inhibitors being the most effective treatment, although additive effects of antibodies against PVR and PVRL2 could not be verified in all cases (data not shown). To confirm specificity of the approach and to exclude effects caused by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), PVR and PVRL2 double knockouts of the cell line MV4-11 were generated by CRISPR/Cas-9. Significantly increased killing was observed in PVR and PVRL2 double knockout cells compared to wild-type cells (40.5\u00b18.1% vs. 25.9\u00b19.1; n=3, p<0.001). Further experiments using an irrelevant antibody against CD117 or Fcy receptor blockade by purified IgG antibodies excluded ADCC confirming the functional relevance of PVR/PVRL2 blockade.",
                                "The expression of immune checkpoint ligands PVR and PVRL2 confers a negative prognosis to AML patients possibly due to immune evasion. We could further show that the killing of AML cells by PBMCs could be augmented by blockade of these novel checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, addition of PVR and/or PVRL2 blocking antibodies to AMG 330 could enhance cytotoxicity. Therefore, blockade of PVR and PVRL2 represents a promising target for the treatment of AML.",
