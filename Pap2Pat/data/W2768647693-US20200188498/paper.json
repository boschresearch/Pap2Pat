    "abstract": "Obligate intracellular bacteria (obligates) belonging to Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales cause diseases in hundreds of millions of people worldwide and in many animal species. Lack of an efficient system for targeted mutagenesis in obligates remains a major impediment in understanding microbial pathogenesis. Challenges in creating targeted mutations may be attributed to essential nature of majority of the genes and intracellular replication dependence. Despite success in generating random mutations, a method that works well in creating mutations in specific genes of interest followed by complementation remains problematic for obligates and is a highly sought-after goal. We describe protocols to generate stable targeted mutations by allelic exchange in Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an obligate intracellular tick-borne bacterium responsible for human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Targeted mutations in E. chaffeensis were created to disrupt two genes, and also to restore one gene by another allelic exchange mutation leading to the restoration of transcription and protein expression from the inactivated gene and the recovered organisms also express mCherry, which distinguishes from the wild type. We expect that the methods developed are broadly applicable to other obligates, particularly to rickettsial pathogens, to routinely perform targeted mutations to enable studies focused on protein structure-function analyses, host-pathogen interactions and in developing vaccines.",

                "Obligate intracellular bacteria are responsible for causing diseases in hundreds of millions of people worldwide. They include many pathogenic Gram-negatives of the orders Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales1\u20133. Lack of an efficient system for targeted mutagenesis in obligates belonging to Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales of the genera Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Orientia and Chlamydia remains a major impediment in understanding microbial pathogenesis and in defining the functional significance of many genes of the obligates. Chlamydiales and Rickettsiales have undergone extreme genome reductions4\u20137 where the majority of genes for each pathogen may be critical for their intracellular growth. Thus, obligates depend on their hosts to fill in the deficiencies resulting from genome reductions. Consistent with this hypothesis, prior studies demonstrate that nearly 74-92% of the predicted genes in Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, and Chlamydia species are transcriptionally active during bacterial replication in the host cells of vertebrates and vectors8\u201311. Challenges in creating targeted mutations may be attributed to the essential nature of a gene selected for mutagenesis, intracellular replication dependence and the lack of methods to support extracellular growth. Despite the success in generating random mutations using transposon mutagenesis12\u201317, and having a limited success of creating targeted mutations in rickettsial pathogens15,18, presently a method that works well in creating targeted mutations in specific genes of interest followed by complementation remains problematic for the obligate pathogens and it is also a highly sought-after goal19\u201323. We have filled this major methodological deficiency by developing protocols to generate stable targeted mutations by allelic exchange in Ehrlichia chaffeensis where we could disrupt two genes, and also restore the intact gene by another allelic exchange mutation in one of the two genes, resulting the restored transcription of the inactivated gene from its own promoter.",
                "E. chaffeensis is a tick-transmitted rickettsial bacterium and is the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME)7. HME is an emerging infectious disease in the USA and is also frequently reported from other parts of the world24. It is an acute flu-like illness having clinical signs including fever, headache, myalgia, anorexia and chills and is commonly associated with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and upgraded levels of serum hepatic aminotransferases2. Similarly, several other Anaplasmataceae family pathogens, including the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, have been identified in recent years as the causative agents of important emerging diseases in people and various vertebrate animals2,25,26. The limited availability of genetic tools to study obligate intracellular pathogens, including the genera Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Chlamydia, particularly in creating targeted mutations restrict our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and how the pathogens overcome host clearance27\u201329. Recently, we reported both random and targeted mutations in E. chaffeensis 15. Himar1 transposase based random mutagenesis is efficient in creating mutations in both protein coding and non-coding regions of several genes15. Himar1 random mutagenesis aided in elucidating host-pathogen interactions and assessing the value of mutants for development of attenuated mutant vaccines30,31. We also described targeted mutations at three genomic sites by allelic exchange and by group II intron mutagenesis methods; however, the targeted mutations persisted only for few days in cell cultures15. These data suggest that the targeted mutagenesis requires considerable standardization.",
                "In this study, with the primary goal of optimizing methods for disrupting and restoring a gene of interest in obligates, we carried out allelic exchange mutation experiments in two E. chaffeensis genes, Ech_0230 and Ech_0379, where we previously reported stable insertion mutations by transposon mutagenesis15. Mutagenesis constructs were prepared and successfully used in disrupting the two genes and then in restoring one of the two inactivated genes, Ech_0379."

Similarly, transposon mutation within the coding region of Ech_0379 resulted in the transcriptional inactivation15. To generate targeted mutations at the same genomic locations, about 1\u2009kb of E. chaffeensis genomic DNA segments upstream and downstream of the previously defined mutation insertion sites of the Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 genes were obtained by PCR and cloned into a plasmid vector. The promoter segment of E. chaffeensis elongation factor Tu gene, Tuf-2, (Ech_0407) was similarly cloned in front of the aadA gene coding sequence into a separate plasmid (aadA gene confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin)12. Tuf-2 gene promoter (tuf) was chosen for aadA gene transcription because it drives the expression of a highly conserved and constitutively expressed protein (Tu) that is necessary for the polypeptide elongation process in the protein translation machinery32. Further, our bioinformatics analysis and transcription mapping by primer extension experiment suggested that it is a strong promoter responsible for transcribing 25 genes, most of which encode for 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins, and having multiple transcription start sites (not shown). The aadA gene was chosen as it works well in conferring antibiotic resistance in E. chaffeensis and in Anaplasma species13,15. The tuf-aadA segment was engineered into the homologous recombination plasmid constructs of Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 (named as pHR-Ech_0230-tuf-aadA and pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA, respectively) (Fig.\u00a01). Linear DNA fragments from the plasmid constructs containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 homology arms of the genes flanking the tuf-aadA segment were generated by PCR for use in creating targeted mutations.",

Gent was codon optimized for efficient translation in E. chaffeensis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). Linear fragments from the plasmid were prepared from the construct containing the 5\u2032 homology arm including the Ech_0379 gene ORF followed by mCh-Gent segment driven from Amtr promoter and the 3\u2032 end genomic segment downstream to the Ech_0379 insertion to serve as the 3\u2032 homology arm (Fig.\u00a01)."

E. coli antiporter gene mutant strain, EP432 having mutations in two of the three antiporter genes33, is exploited as a great research tool in studying antiporter proteins of several Gram negative bacteria34,35. In particular, this E. coli strain is used in mapping the functions of antiporter proteins by functional complementation assays. Complementation assays are performed in conferring resistance to its Na+ sensitivity in high NaCl concentrations in a growth medium. To define the function of Ech_0379 gene product in E. chaffeensis and also to assess the impact of targeted disruption and complementation mutations, we adopted the E. coli complementation assay using the EP432 strain. We cloned the Ech_0379 gene sequences, including its native promoter, from wild-type, gene disruption or gene restoration mutant organisms into a plasmid and then transformed the plasmids individually into the EP432 strain. To serve as a positive control, E. coli NhaA (one of its missing antiporter genes) is similarly cloned and transformed, while non-recombinant plasmid transformed culture of the strain was used as a negative control. DNA-free total RNAs recovered from E. coli strains containing the Ech_0379 genes were assessed for the presence of the gene transcripts by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a06A). Predicted amplicons were detected only for RNAs recovered from the E. coli containing Ech_0379 gene from the wild-type and the gene restoration mutant of E. chaffeensis, but not in the RNA from the strain containing the disruption mutant E. chaffeensis gene. We then tested the E. coli cultures for the antiporter protein activity by functional complementation assay to rescue its Na+ sensitivity (Fig.\u00a06B).

Complementation mutation to restore the gene activity from one of the two genes (Ech_0379) was also accomplished when targeted to the mutated region. The presence of insertions in the E. chaffeensis genome was confirmed by the development of antibiotic resistance, using three independent molecular methods; PCR, PCR DNA sequence and Southern blot analysis.

All three mutations grew continuously in both ISE6 and DH82 host cells for several months of assessment. There was no evidence to support the presence of off-target insertions developed during all the three mutational experiments. Moreover, the restoration mutant is similar to wild type and yet it can be discriminated from wild type, as it expresses the fluorescent protein, mCherry. In the restoration mutant, open reading frame of the inactivated gene is completely restored in front of its own promoter. Its gene structure is, therefore, similar to the wild type E. chaffeensis, except that it also expresses mCherry and gentamicin resistance proteins. This modified E. chaffeensis, that is similar to wild type, will be useful for studies in monitoring the pathogen in real time by fluorescence imaging in vitro and in vivo, similar to prior studies described for Borrelia burgdorferi 36.",
                "In this study, we carefully selected promoters, antibiotic resistance genes and cell lines in improving the efficiency of targeted mutations. Based on previous targeted and random mutagenesis experiments of Anaplasmataceae family pathogens belonging to the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, a greater mutagenesis success is reported with the tick cell line, ISE612,15,16. Therefore to maximize our efforts in succeeding the mutants\u2019 generation, we routinely performed mutagenesis experiments in ISE6 cells. We believe that the use of tuf promoter and the development of a codon-optimized Gent are broadly applicable for mutagenesis experiments in other obligate bacteria, particularly for the rickettsial pathogens. Additional minor modifications, such as exchanging a tuf promoter and further codon optimization of antibiotic resistance cassettes, may be required in enhancing the mutation success when working with other distantly related obligate bacteria. The Amtr promoter, aadA and mCherry ORFs are frequently and successfully used in mutagenesis experiments in Rickettsiales12,13,15 and our current study validated their broader applicability.",
                "Ability to create targeted mutations to disrupt and also to restore the integrity of a gene is of exceptional significance to the studies of obligate bacteria; our study represents a major advancement for the research in defining the functions of many proteins likely contributing to pathogenesis and in altering a host response, as these methods are not fully developed up to now and also is a highly sought after goal, most certainly for rickettsiales and chlamydiales22,23. Recently, targeted disruption and restoration of a gene is described for R. rickettsii using the group II intron based mutagenesis method21. While this is encouraging, group II intron-based mutagenesis is not broadly applicable for many gene targets, as the identification of optimal sequences within a gene by the proprietary algorithm is necessary prior to any attempts in creating disruption and restoration mutations. Similarly, a recent study described the application of a suicide vector to create targeted mutations in Chlamydia trachomatis as a way of developing genetic manipulation by allelic exchange and the method introduced a fluorescent protein to allow monitoring of mutagenesis by fluorescence microscopy20. Likewise, our study also included the expression of a fluorescent protein to permit monitoring the bacterial growth, a significant benefit when manipulating intracellular bacteria. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate a complementation method for an obligate using a homologous recombination method.",
                "Currently, transposon mutagenesis to create random mutations is the only major alternative for investigations on obligates focused on identifying genes essential for understanding pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions, including efforts in developing attenuated vaccines12,15,16,30,31,37,38. However, transposon mutagenesis method cannot be used in targeting a gene of interest. Targeted mutagenesis methods, described in the current study, are broadly applicable in creating similar mutations in other related pathogenic rickettsiales to test molecular Koch\u2019s postulates to define a specific gene function19,39.",
                "Ability to create allelic exchange mutations has many applications; for example, it can be used in inserting a DNA to express antisense RNA to knockdown the expression from a gene of interest or to define the function of a hypothetical gene. Additionally, protein tags, such as fluorescent proteins or Histidine tags, could be engineered as bacterial fusion proteins to serve as translational markers40 useful in defining protein-protein interactions, and to map secretions of bacterial effectors into host cell cytoplasm, mitochondria and/or nucleus41\u201344. Despite the identification of several bacterial secretory effectors by various secretory systems as influencing the host responses45, much remains to be understood in identifying and defining the functions of many unknown effector proteins. Two distinct antibiotic resistance cassettes and promoter segments described in this study for creating allelic exchange mutations will be valuable in generating dual mutants to study interactions of two or more gene products. Targeted disruption to study an essential gene of an obligate may require innovative gene manipulation strategies, such as disrupting only parts of the functional domains of a protein critical for the bacterial growth. The methods in creating allelic exchange mutations reported in this study, therefore, are expected to serve as a catalyst in initiating detailed reverse genetic studies in defining microbial pathogenesis, bacterial and host protein-protein interactions, immunity and vaccine development in several obligates impacting human and animal health."

Plasmids described in this study were listed in Supplementary Table\u00a0S2. The Platinum\u00ae Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used in all PCR experiments for preparing the constructs. About 2.0\u2009kb genomic DNA segments spanning about 1\u2009kb each from both sides of the previously identified mutation insertion sites of the Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 genes were generated by PCR using E. chaffeensis genomic DNA as the template. Genome coordinates (GenBank # CP000236.1) of the amplified segments of Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 genes are 218,060 to 220,133 and 373,265 to 375,810, respectively. The amplicons were cloned into the pCR\u21222.1-TOPO TA vector (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Linear fragments were then generated from the entire plasmids (pHR-Ech_0230 and pHR-Ech_0379 respectively) containing the gene segments using Ech_0230 or Ech_0379 gene specific primers designed to split these gene fragments to two equal halves positioned at each end of the linear fragments and keeping the plasmid backbone in the middle (fragment 1). Tuf-2 gene (Ech_0407) promoter (tuf) spanning 0.37\u2009kb DNA was generated by PCR using E. chaffeensis genomic DNA as the template (genome coordinates are 396,385 to 396,751). The aadA gene open reading frame (ORF) was obtained by PCR from pCis mCherry-SS Himar A7 plasmid15. The tuf promoter and aadA ORF were also cloned into a separate pCR\u21222.1-TOPO TA vector and used to generate linear fragments of tuf-aadA segment (fragment 2). By following the protocols of Gibson Assembly method (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), the linear fragments 1 and 2 were assembled to create the final homologous recombinant plasmid constructs, where the gene segments were disrupted with the insertion of tuf-aadA segment. The final constructs were named as pHR-Ech_0230-tuf-aadA and pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Subsequently, linear fragments from the constructs containing both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 homology arms of each gene disruption segments flanking the tuf-aadA cassette were generated by PCR, purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and concentrated to 1\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5l in nuclease free water.",
                        "For constructing the Ech_0379 gene rescue template, we first generated the 3\u2032 end 0.4\u2009kb missing portion of the gene fragment downstream from the mutation site by PCR from E. chaffeensis genomic DNA (genomic coordinates are 374,462 to 374,837). The Amtr-mCherry (Amtr-mCh) DNA segments constituting the Anapmasma marginale transcription regulator (Tr) promoter and mCherry ORF were amplified using pCis mCherry-SS Himar A7 plasmid15. The gentamicin resistance gene coding sequence (Gent) was codon optimized to frequently found codons of E. chaffeensis (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). The Gent segment was then cloned downstream to Amtr-mCh fragment to generate Amtr-mCh-Gent fusion fragment. The 3\u2032 end 0.4\u2009kb Ech_0379 segment was then ligated at the 5\u2032 end of the Amtr-mCh-Gent fragment by performing overlapping PCR experiment and the amplicons was subsequently cloned into the pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA construct to replace the tuf-aadA segment with Amtr-mCh-Gent segment containing the additional 3\u2032 end 0.4\u2009kb Ech_0379 ORF segment (by Gibson Assembly method). The final plasmid construct (pHR-res-Ech_0379-Amtr-mCh-Gent) included the full length Ech_0379 ORF, followed by the Amtr-mCh-Gent and the 3\u2032 end 1\u2009kb genomic segment downstream from the mutation in Ech_0379 gene (Fig.\u00a01). Linear fragments containing the entire Ech_0379 gene at the 5\u2032 end, Amtr-mCh-Gent segment and the additional 3\u20323\u2032 end 1\u2009kb segment of Ech_0379 gene were then obtained by PCR from the recombinant plasmid; the DNA was purified and concentrated to 1\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5l."

PCR products were resolved on a 0.9% agarose gel to identify specific predicted amplicons and then subjected to sequencing analysis to map the genomic junctions of the insertions from both ends of the amplicons. Mutations and clonal purity was further confirmed by Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme digested DNAs; genomic DNAs from wild type and mutant organisms were subjected to restriction enzyme digestions using ClaI, EcoRI or HindIII, resolved on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)44.
