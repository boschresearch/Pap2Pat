    "abstract": "Targeted disruption of a specific gene and its subsequent restoration in obligate intracellular bacteria remains extremely challenging due to their absolute requirement for residence inside a host cell to replicate. Here, targeted allelic exchange mutations were created to inactivate two genes and then to restore one of the two genes of a rickettsial pathogen, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. These methods were then also successfully utilized in Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocyophilum. The resultant mutated pathogens are useful in immunogenic compositions for reducing the incidence of or severity of infection with ricksettsial pathogens.",

                        "Disrupting specific gene function and subsequent restoration of its activity in obligate intracellular bacteria remains extremely challenging due to their absolute requirement for residence inside a host cell to replicate. Here, we created targeted mutations by allelic exchange in two genes and genetically complemented one gene of the rickettsial pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis. In principle, this approach can be applied to other obligate intracellular bacteria and will enable structure-function analyses routinely done in intracellular bacteria. The method is also applicable in generating attenuated strains of obligate intracellular bacteria, which will be valuable in serving as live vaccine candidates.",
                        "Obligate intracellular bacteria (hereafter \u201cobligates\u201d) are responsible for causing diseases in millions of people worldwide. They include many pathogenic Gram-negatives of the orders Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales. Lack of an efficient system for targeted mutagenesis in Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales of the genera Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Neorickettssia, Orientia and Chlamydia remains a major impediment in understanding microbial pathogenesis and in defining the functional significance of many bacterial genes. Chlamydiales and Rickettsiales have undergone extreme genome reductions where the majority of genes for each pathogen may be critical for their intracellular growth. Thus, obligate intracellular bacteria depend on their hosts to fill in the deficiencies resulting from genome reductions. Consistent with this hypothesis, prior studies demonstrate that nearly 74-92% of the predicted genes in Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Neorickettsia, and Chlamydia species are transcriptionally active during bacterial replication in the host cells of vertebrates and vectors. Challenges in creating targeted mutations may be attributed to the essential nature of a gene selected for mutagenesis, intracellular replication dependence and the lack of methods to support extracellular growth. Despite the success in generating random mutations using transposon mutagenesis, generating targeted mutations in specific genes of interest followed by complementation is problematic and is also a highly sought-after goal for obligates."

                        "The present disclosure fills this major gap by providing methods to generate at least one stable targeted mutation by allelic exchange in Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales. Advantageously, the disclosure further provides the ability to disrupt or inactivate multiple genes and thereafter restore at least one intact gene by another allelic exchange mutation, resulting in the restored transcription from the inactivated gene from its own promoter. In preferred forms, the disrupted or inactivated genes prevent or at least decrease the ability of the bacteria to replicate in its obligate host while still inducing an immune response specific for the bacteria. Thus, the present disclosure provides attenuated forms of the bacteria that will be useful in immunogenic compositions that induce immune responses that decrease the incidence or severity of at least one clinical sign associated with or caused by Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales when administered prophylactically, and decrease the duration or severity of at least one clinical sign associated with or caused by Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales when administered after infection has already occurred.",
                        "\u201cSequence Identity\u201d as it is known in the art refers to a relationship between two or more polypeptide (poly amino acid) sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, namely a reference sequence and a given sequence to be compared with the reference sequence. Sequence identity is determined by comparing the given sequence to the reference sequence after the sequences have been optimally aligned to produce the highest degree of sequence similarity, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. Upon such alignment, sequence identity is ascertained on a position-by-position basis, e.g., the sequences are \u201cidentical\u201d at a particular position if at that position, the nucleotides or amino acid residues are identical. The total number of such position identities is then divided by the total number of nucleotides or amino acid residues in the reference sequence to give % sequence identity. Sequence identity can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. N., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988), Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993); Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey (1994); Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinge, G., Academic Press (1987); Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991); and Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred methods to determine the sequence identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine sequence identity are codified in publicly available computer programs, which determine sequence identity between given sequences. Examples of such programs include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 12(1):387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN and FASTA (Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990). The BLASTX program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S. et al., NCVI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894, Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference). These programs optimally align sequences using default gap weights in order to produce the highest level of sequence identity between the given and reference sequences. As an illustration, by a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence having at least, for example, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% \u201csequence identity\u201d to a reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the given polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the given polynucleotide sequence may include up to 15, preferably up to 10, even more preferably up to 5 point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, in a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence having at least 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% identity relative to the reference nucleotide sequence, up to 15%, preferably 10%, even more preferably 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 15%, preferably 10%, even more preferably 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. Analogously, by a polypeptide having a given amino acid sequence having at least, for example, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% sequence identity to a reference amino acid sequence, it is intended that the given amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the given polypeptide sequence may include up to 15, preferably up to 10, even more preferably up to 5 amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a given polypeptide sequence having at least 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% sequence identity with a reference amino acid sequence, up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or the carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in the one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. However, conservative substitutions are not included as a match when determining sequence identity.",
                        "\u201cSequence homology\u201d, as used herein, refers to a method of determining the relatedness of two sequences. To determine sequence homology, two or more sequences are optimally aligned, and gaps are introduced if necessary. However, in contrast to \u201csequence identity\u201d, conservative amino acid substitutions are counted as a match when determining sequence homology. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide or polynucleotide having 95% sequence homology with a reference sequence, 85%, preferably 90%, even more preferably 95% of the amino acid residues or nucleotides in the reference sequence must match or comprise a conservative substitution with another amino acid or nucleotide, or a number of amino acids or nucleotides up to 15%, preferably up to 10%, even more preferably up to 5% of the total amino acid residues or nucleotides, not including conservative substitutions, in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. Preferably the homolog sequence comprises at least a stretch of 50, even more preferably at least 100, even more preferably at least 250, and even more preferably at least 500 nucleotides.",
                        "A \u201cconservative substitution\u201d refers to the substitution of an amino acid residue or nucleotide with another amino acid residue or nucleotide having similar characteristics or properties including size, hydrophobicity, etc., such that the overall functionality does not change significantly.",
                        "Those of skill in the art will understand that the immunogenic composition used herein may incorporate known injectable, physiologically acceptable sterile solutions for preparing a ready-to-use solution for parenteral injection or infusion, aqueous isotonic solutions, such as e.g. saline or corresponding plasma protein solutions, are readily available. In addition, the immunogenic and vaccine compositions of the present disclosure can include diluents, isotonic agents, stabilizers, or adjuvants. Diluents can include water, saline, dextrose, ethanol, glycerol, and the like. Isotonic agents can include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and lactose, among others. Stabilizers include albumin and alkali salts of ethylendiamintetracetic acid, among others.",

                        "\u201cAdjuvants\u201d as used herein, can include aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, saponins, Quil A, cyclic GMP-AMP, montanide gel, QS-21 (Cambridge Biotech Inc., Cambridge Mass.), GPI-0100 (Galenica Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.), water-in-oil emulsion, oil-in-water emulsion, water-in-oil-in-water emulsion. The emulsion can be based in particular on light liquid paraffin oil (European Pharmacopea type); isoprenoid oil such as squalane or squalene oil resulting from theoligomerization of alkenes, in particular of isobutene or decene; esters of acids or of alcohols containing a linear alkyl group, more particularly plant oils, ethyl oleate, propylene glycol di-(caprylate/caprate), glyceryl tri-(caprylate/caprate) or propylene glycol dioleate; esters of branched fatty acids or alcohols, in particular isostearic acid esters. The oil is used in combination with emulsifiers to form the emulsion. The emulsifiers are preferably nonionic surfactants, in particular esters of sorbitan, of mannide (e.g. anhydromannitol oleate), of glycol, of polyglycerol, of propylene glycol and of oleic, isostearic, ricinoleic or hydroxystearic acid, which are optionally ethoxylated, and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene copolymer blocks, in particular the Pluronic products, especially L121.

For example, it is possible to use the SPT emulsion described on page 147 of \u201cVaccine Design, The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach\u201d edited by M. Powell and M. Newman, Plenum Press, 1995, and the emulsion MF59 described on page 183 of this same book. A further instance of an adjuvant is a compound chosen from the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative. Advantageous adjuvant compounds are the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid which are cross-linked, especially with polyalkenyl ethers of sugars or polyalcohols. These compounds are known by the term carbomer (Phameuropa Vol. 8, No. 2, June 1996). Persons skilled in the art can also refer to U.S. Pat. No. 2,909,462 which describes such acrylic polymers cross-linked with a polyhydroxylated compound having at least 3 hydroxyl groups, preferably not more than 8, the hydrogen atoms of at least three hydroxyls being replaced by unsaturated aliphatic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms. The preferred radicals are those containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. vinyls, allyls and other ethylenically unsaturated groups. The unsaturated radicals may themselves contain other substituents, such as methyl. Further suitable adjuvants include, but are not limited to, the RIBI adjuvant system (Ribi Inc.), Block co-polymer (CytRx, Atlanta Ga.), SAF-M (Chiron, Emeryville Calif.), monophosphoryl lipid A, Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin from E. coli (recombinant or otherwise), cholera toxin, IMS 1314, or muramyl dipeptide among many others.",

                        "About 1 kb of E. chaffeensis genomic DNA segments upstream and downstream of the previously defined random insertion mutation sites of the Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 gene were obtained by PCR and cloned into a plasmid vector. The promoter segment of E. chaffeensis elongation factor Tu gene, Tuf-2, (Ech_0407) was similarly cloned in front of the aadA gene coding sequence into a separate plasmid (aadA gene confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin). Tuf-2 gene promoter (tuf) was chosen for aadA protein expression because it drives the expression of a highly conserved and constitutively expressed protein, Tu that is necessary for the polypeptide elongation process in the protein translation machinery. Further, our bioinformatics analysis and transcription mapping by primer extension experiment suggested that it is a strong promoter responsible for transcribing genes, most of which encode for 30S and 505 ribosomal proteins, and having multiple transcription start sites (not shown). The aadA gene was chosen as it works well in conferring antibiotic resistance in E. chaffeensis and in Anaplasma species. The tuf-aadA segment was engineered into the homologous recombination constructs of Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 (pHR-Ech_0230-tuf-aadA and pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA, respectively). Linear DNA fragments from the constructs containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 homology arms of the genes separated by the tuf-aadA segment were generated by PCR for use in creating targeted mutations. To create a rescue mutagenesis template in reversing the targeted gene mutation within the Ech_0379 gene, 0.5 kb fragment downstream from the mutation site of the gene was obtained by PCR from E. chaffeensis genome and it was engineered into the pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA construct to generate a modified construct; pHR-res-Ech_0379-Amtr-mCh-Gent containing the entire Ech_0379 gene ORF at the 5\u2032 end followed by the presence of the Amtr promoter, the ORFs of mCherry and the gentamicin resistance cassettes (Gent) (Amtr-mCh-Gent) and a 1 kb genomic segment containing the 3\u2032 portion of the Ech_0379 gene. Gent was codon optimized for efficient translation in E. chaffeensis. Linear fragments from the rescue construct were then prepared which contained the 5\u2032homology arm beginning with the Ech_0379 gene followed by Amtr-mCh-Gent segment and the 3\u2032 end genomic segment downstream to the Ech_0379 insertion to serve as the 3\u2032 homology arm. Linear DNA fragments to disrupt Ech_0230 or Ech_0379 genes were electroporated into host cell-free wild type E. chaffeensis organisms recovered from ISE6 tick cells and then allowed to re-infect ISE6 tick cells. The mutants were selected for their ability to grow in the medium containing spectinomycin and streptomycin for several weeks and then allowed to infect macrophage cell line, DH82, for continued growth for several months. For rescue mutation experiment, linear DNA fragments of the Ech_0379 gene restoration template were similarly electroporated into E. chaffeensis organisms containing mutation in the Ech_0379 gene. E. chaffeensis cultures with Ech_0379 gene restored were then selected by their ability to grow in the medium containing gentamicin. Following the recovery of E. chaffeensis cultures growing in the media containing antibiotics, targeted gene inactivations in Ech_0230 or Ech_0379 were confirmed by two insertion specific PCR assays targeting 1) to the genomic region 5\u2032 to the allelic exchange site and to the insertion specific DNA, and 2) to the insertion DNA and to the 3\u2032 of the allelic exchange site on the genome. Clonal purity was then confirmed by another PCR assay targeting the genomic regions upstream and downstream of the allelic exchange insertion sites. The integrity of the PCR products was confirmed by PCR-DNA sequence analysis. For Ech_0379 gene restoration mutant generation was also assessed for the mCherry protein expression by fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 5B). The presence of mutations in the E. chaffeensis genome was also validated by Southern blot analysis for both the gene disruption mutations and gene restoration mutation. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 transcripts were present in wild type E. chaffeensis and were absent in the gene disruption mutant organisms. The complemented mutant strain tested positive for the Ech_0379 transcript similar to wild type E. chaffeensis. Further, we tested if the allelic exchange mutations to inactivate and restore gene activity in Ech_0379 can cause polar effects in altering the gene expression from its neighboring genes. The analysis was carried out by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays where three sets of PCR cycles were used; 30, 35 and 40. Independent of the numbers of PCR cycles performed, RT-PCR products were similar for Ech_0378 and Ech_0380 for wild type, gene inactivation mutant and gene rescue mutant, and Ech_0379 RT-PCR products were absent only in the gene inactivation mutant, while appeared similar for wild type and gene rescue mutant (FIG. 6C). There was no evidence to support the presence of off-target insertions developed during all the three mutational experiments. The Ech_0379 gene open reading frame is completely restored in front of its own promoter resulting from the complementation allelic exchange mutation experiment and its gene structure is, therefore, similar to the wild type E. chaffeensis, except that it also expresses mCherry and gentamicin resistance proteins. This modified E. chaffeensis, that is similar to wild type in having the complete genome, will be useful for novel studies in monitoring the pathogen in real time by fluorescence imaging in vitro and in vivo, similar to prior studies described for Borrelia burgdorferi.",

                                "An illustration of the detailed molecular steps followed in preparing the constructs for allelic exchange mutagenesis experiments are depicted in FIG. 1. The Platinum\u00ae Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was used in all PCR experiments while preparing the constructs. Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 genes of E. chaffeensis were used to create allelic exchange mutations as we previously reported random mutations within these genes by Himar1 random mutagenesis method and that the mutant organisms grow normally under in vitro cultures. About 2.0 kb genomic DNA segments spanning about 1 kb each from both sides of the previously identified mutation insertion sites of the genes (referred as A and A\u2032 in FIG. 1) were amplified from E. chaffeensis genome (GenBank # CP000236.1; Himar1 mutation insertion sites for Ech_0230 and EcH_0379 are 219,097 and 374,461, respectively). Genome coordinates of the amplified segments of Ech_0230 and Ech_0379 genes are 218,060 to 220,133 and 373,265 to 375,810, respectively. The amplicons were first cloned into the plasmid, pCR\u21222.1-TOPO TA vector (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.) by following manufacturer instructions. Tuf-2 gene (Ech_0407) promoter (tuf) spanning 0.37 kb DNA was also amplified from the E. chaffeensis genome (genome coordinates of this segment are 396,385 to 396,751) for use in constitutive expression of the aadA gene product to confer resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin. The aadA gene open reading frame (ORF) was obtained by PCR from pCis mCherry-SS Himar A7 plasmid (Sahni, S. K., Narra, H. P., Sahni, A., and Walker, D. H.; Future Microbiol; 8, 1265-1288 (2013).) The tuf promoter and aadA ORF were also cloned into a separate pCR\u21222.1-TOPO TA vector and the plasmid was then used to generate linear fragments of tuf-aadA segment (fragment 1) for incorporation into the final targeted gene disruption mutagenesis constructs. Linear fragments were then generated from the entire plasmids (pHR-Ech_0230 and pHR-Ech_0379 respectively) containing the gene segments using Ech_0230 or Ech_0379 gene specific primers designed to split these gene fragments to two equal halves positioned at each end of the linear fragments and keeping the plasmid backbone in the middle (fragment 2). By following the protocols of Gibson Assembly method (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.), the linear fragments 1 and 2 were then ligated to create the final homologous recombinant plasmid constructs, where the gene segments were disrupted with the insertion of tuf-aadA segments. The final constructs were named as pHR-Ech_0230-tuf-aadA and pHR-Ech_0379-tuf-aadA, respectively (FIGS. 2A and 2B, respectively). (GenBank submission # s 2012015 and 2012023; accession numbers are yet to be received.) Subsequently, linear fragments from these constructs containing both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 homology arms of each gene disruption segments along with the tuf-aadA cassette were generated by PCR (FIG. 3A). The amplicons were then resolved on a 1% agarose gels (FIG. 3B); DNAs were gel isolated and concentrated to 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in nuclease free water for use in the allelic exchange mutagenesis experiments to create targeted gene disruptions.",
                                "For constructing the Ech_0379 gene function rescue template, the 3\u2032 end 0.5 kb fragment downstream from the mutation site by PCR using E. chaffeensis genomic DNA was generated as the template (genomic coordinates are 374,462 to 374,837). The Amtr-mCherry (Amtr-mCh) DNA segments constituting the Anapmasma marginale transcription regulator (Tr) gene promoter and mCherry ORF were amplified using pCis mCherry-SS Himar A7 plasmid as the template. The gentamicin resistance gene coding sequence (Gent) was codon optimized commercially (GenScript, Piscataway, N.J.) (GenBank # KY977452) as per the frequently found codons of E. chaffeensis genome. The Gent segment was then used to clone downstream to Amtr-mCh fragment to generate Amtr-mCh-Gent fusion fragment. The 3\u2032 end 0.5 kb Ech_0379 segment was then ligated at the 5\u2032 end of the Amtr-mCh-Gent fragment by performing overlapping PCR and the final amplicon was subsequently cloned into the Ech_0379-tuf-aadA-HR 1 construct to replace the tuf-aadA segment with Amtr-mCh-Gent segment containing the 3\u2032 end 0.5 kb Ech_0379 ORF segment by performing the Gibson Assembly cloning strategy. The final Ech_0379 rescue plasmid construct; pHR-res-Ech_0379-Amtr-mCh-Gent included the full length Ech_0379 ORF restored in front of its own promoter, followed by the Amtr-mCh-Gent and the 3\u2032 end 1 kb genomic segment of Ech_0379 gene (FIG. 2C) (GenBank submission #2012033; accession number is yet to be received). This construct was then used as the template to generate linear fragments by PCR which contained the entire Ech_0379 gene at the 5\u2032 end, including its own promoter and the complete ORF, followed by Amtr-mCh-Gent segment and the additional 3\u2032 end 1 kb segment downstream from Ech_0379 gene mutation site (FIG. 5A). The PCR product was purified by QIAquick PCR Pruification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and concentrated to 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in nuclease-free water as outlined above for use in the allelic exchange mutagenesis experiment to restore the integrity of the gene in E. chaffeensis organisms having Ech_0379 gene disruption.",

Similar experiment was carried out to obtain Ech_0379 gene restoration mutant, except that the media containing 80 \u03bcg/ml of gentamicin were used after 24 h of electroporation. Ech_0379 gene restoration mutant cultures were also assessed by detecting the expression of mCherry by examining the cultures using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, N.Y.).

The 3rd PCR assay (FIG. 4B third panel) was designed to also test the clonal purity of mutants; primers used in this assay were targeted to the genomic regions upstream and downstream of the allelic exchange insertion sites (FIG. 4C). The PCR products were resolved on a 0.9% agarose gel to identify specific predicted length amplicons and then subjected to sequencing analysis to further confirm the integrity by mapping the genomic junctions of the insertions from both ends of the amplicons. Mutations and clonal purity was subsequently confirmed by Southern blot analysis (FIG. 4D).

Mutations within certain genomic locations of the pathogen aid in understanding the pathogenesis and in developing attenuated vaccines. Our previous studies demonstrated that mutations in different genomic sites in E. chaffeensis caused variable impacts on their growth and attenuation in vertebrate and tick hosts. Here, we assessed the effect of three mutations on transcriptional changes using RNA deep-sequencing technology. RNA sequencing aided in detecting 66-80% of the transcripts of wildtype and mutant E. chaffeensis. Mutation in an antiporter gene (ECH_0379) causing attenuated growth in vertebrate hosts resulted in the down regulation of many transcribed genes. Similarly, a mutation downstream to the ECH_0490 coding sequence resulted in minimal impact on the pathogen's in vivo growth, but caused major changes in its transcriptome. This mutation caused enhanced expression of several host stress response genes. Even though the ECH_0660 gene mutation caused the pathogen's rapid clearance in vertebrate hosts and aids in generating a protective response, there was minimal impact on the transcriptome. The transcriptomic data offer novel insights about the impact of mutations on global gene expression and how they may contribute to the pathogen's resistance and/or clearance from the host.",

Mutations at certain genomic locations, leading to gene expression changes, impact the pathogen's ability to cause infection and persistence in a host. The genome of E. chaffeensis may have evolved within a host cell environment leading to the development of mechanisms to undermine the host immune response. Pathogenesis-associated E. chaffeensis genes are likely highly active in a host microenvironment and consistent with this hypothesis, differential gene expression in response to host cell defense is known to occur. Progress has been made towards identifying genes crucial for Ehrlichia survival in a host cell environment. However, to date only a few abundantly expressed genes are identified as associated with pathogenesis. Defining the genes involved in pathogenesis and virulence, and documenting their differential expression may aid in the discovery of novel proteins valuable as targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccine development for HME.",
                                "Genetically mutated intracellular pathogens are important resources for studying microbial pathogenesis, and also aid in the efforts of vaccine development. Our previous study demonstrated the feasibility of transposon-based mutations in E. chaffeensis. We also found that some insertion mutations resulting in transcriptional inactivation of membrane protein genes cause attenuation of the growth of the pathogen in vertebrate hosts. Insertions within the coding regions of ECH_0379 and ECH_0660 genes offered varying levels of protection against infection in a vertebrate host. In this study, we hypothesized that the mutations' specific genomic locations may impact global gene expression and contribute to the pathogen's altered survival, infection progression, and replication in a host cell environment. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the impact of three mutations, reported earlier by Cheng et al., on global gene transcription. We selected two mutants with mutations within the coding regions of the ECH_0660 gene encoding for a phage like protein (ECH_0660) and the ECH_0379 gene encoding for an anti-porter protein (ECH_0379). Insertion mutation in ECH_0660 gene is located at the nucleotide position 213 of the 555 base long open reading frame. Similarly, mutation in ECH_0379 gene is located at the nucleotide position 682 of the 1056 base long open reading frame.

                                "High throughput RNA sequencing (RNA seq) technologies have proven to be reliable and robust tools for determining global transcriptome activity in obligate intracellular bacteria. Comparative genomic studies identified several classes of virulence factors involved in secretion and trafficking of molecules between the pathogen and host cells and modulation of the host immune response. However, studies focused on Ehrlichia gene expression have been limited mostly to outer membrane proteins genes, Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) genes, tandem repeat protein (TRP) genes, and ankyrin repeat genes (Anks). Among them, genes encoding for T4SS proteins and p28-OMP proteins have been found to be critical for pathogenicity.",

Technical constraints in isolating Ehrlichia RNA from highly abundant host RNA remains an impediment in profiling of pathogen transcripts. To overcome this limitation, we used an effective cell lysis strategy followed by density gradient centrifugation. Further, we enriched Ehrlichia RNA by efficiently removing polyadenylated RNA (poly(A) RNA) and eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomal RNAs from host and bacteria RNA mixtures. Sequencing of the enriched RNA aided in the detection of transcripts for 66-80% of the annotated E. chaffeensis genes as per the annotated genome: GenBank # CP000236.1.

                                "The major challenge of undertaking transcriptome studies of intracellular pathogens is the difficulty in isolating host-cell free bacteria and subsequently recovering high-quality bacterial RNA. Rickettsial organisms, including E. chaffeensis, constitute only a very small fraction of isolated total RNA. Because of the presence of highly abundant host cell RNA, recovery of bacterial RNA is a challenge for executing RNA seq analysis experiments. In this study, we first purified the host cell-free bacteria from infected host cells (canine macrophage cell line, DH82) by employing an efficient cell lysis method, coupled with density gradient centrifugation protocols. Host cell lysis was performed to efficiently rupture the host cells without causing a major damage to the bacteria. E. chaffeensis organisms are about 0.5 to 1 \u03bcm in diameter. Therefore, infected host cell lysate was filtered through 2 \u03bcm membrane to remove most of the host cell debris. A high-speed Renografin density gradient centrifugation of the resulting E. chaffeensis cell suspension aided in pelleting bacteria while host cell debris remained at the top layer of the solution. After total RNA isolation and DNase treatment, Bioanalyzer analysis revealed that despite the prior fractionation of host cell-free bacteria, the host 28 S and 18 S RNA remained at high concentrations in the recovered RNA. Bacterial mRNA enrichment was carried out by depleting the host poly(A) RNA and eukaryotic ribosomal RNA using a bacterial RNA enrichment protocol, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of host 28 S and 18 S RNA. The absence of contaminating E. chaffeensis genomic DNA in the purified RNA samples was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR using E. chaffeensis 16 S rRNA gene primers. We also confirmed the absence of DNA sequences in the RNA seq raw data by aligning 20 randomly selected E. chaffeensis intergenic non-coding DNA sequences (data not shown).",

                                "Isolation of cell-free bacterial RNA from highly abundant host RNA is the first challenge in transcriptional profiling of intracellular pathogens. Rickettsiales require culturing in host cells and then need to be purified before extracting RNA for transcriptome evaluation experiments. To document the impact of three transposon mutations on E. chaffeensis transcription, we first developed a method for isolation and purification of host cell-free E. chaffeensis organisms, from which we isolated RNA and then subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. To isolate cell-free E. chaffeensis, we started with an efficient host cell lysis protocol, and then filtration of whole cell lysate, followed by a renografin density gradient centrifugation. The second challenge was to obtain host cell-free RNA for transcriptome profiling. Previous studies report that bacterial RNA enrichment methods result in the enrichment of bacterial RNA reads only 3-10%. Isolation of host cell-free bacteria and the bacterial RNA purification steps implemented in our study allowed a greater enrichment of E. chaffeensis RNA. In our current studies, we were able to enrich the bacterial RNA, which helped in generating up to 19% high mapping RNA reads. Notably, deep RNA sequencing analysis aided in mapping 80% of E. chaffeensis genes expressed in infected macrophage host cells.",
                                "Among the highly expressed genes, the p28-OMP multigene cluster was dominant in the transcriptome. The E. chaffeensis p28-OMP multigene locus contains 22 tandemly arranged genes coding for the bacterial immunodominant proteins. The presence of all 22 transcripts in the RNA seq data suggest that the gene cluster is among the most abundantly expressed genes. These observations are consistent with our previous proteomic study where we reported the p28-OMP genes' expression abundance. NADH dehydrogenase I complex genes were also highly expressed in E. chaffeensis. NADH dehydrogenase counters the phagosomal NOX2 response to inhibit host cell apoptosis34. T4SS effector proteins in some pathogenic bacteria are considered as important in manipulating a host gene expression to undermine the host immune response. The contributions of T4SS effectors in pathogenicity are already reported for rickettsiales, including for A. marginale, A. phagocytophilum, E. canis, and E. chaffeensis. The RNA seq analysis identified several transcripts encoding for T4SS proteins, including VirB3, B4, B6, B8, B9, B10, and B11. Chaperone protein genes DnaK, DnaJ, GroE, and ClpB were also highly expressed in both wildtype and mutant strains. The presence of such proteins involved in cell homeostasis and the oxidative stress response is reported in other rickettsiales, suggesting that their gene products are also critical for the E. chaffeensis stress response if the pathogen proteome is similarly altered as per the transcriptome reported in the current study. Indeed, our recent study suggests that the stress response proteins are important for E. chaffeensis. Other highly expressed protein genes included those encoding for housekeeping ribosomal proteins involved in protein synthesis, putative membrane proteins, ABC transporter, and lipoprotein; all of which are likely important for the pathogen's protein synthesis, transport, trafficking, and effector secretion into the host cells. ATP synthase subunit, cytochrome c oxidase, DNA polymerases, GTP-binding protein and translation elongation factors involved energy metabolism, cell division, and transcriptional regulation were also among the highly expressed genes in both wildtype and mutant organisms. The extent of transcriptome coverage is higher than the previously reported for E. chaffeensis in ISE6 and AAE2 tick cells8. This is substantial for both the enhanced detection of intracellular pathogen transcripts and also because of the abundance of gene expressions observed. Higher coverage of the transcriptome likely resulted from deep sequencing of the RNAs by next-generation sequencing compared to microarray analysis. This global set of highly expressed genes may represent products involved in pathogenicity, replication and survival of E. chaffeensis in host cell environment. Four transcripts that code for ankyrin repeat proteins, which are shown to mediate protein-protein interactions, were also identified in the transcriptome. Notably, the transcriptome from the wildtype and mutant organisms contained 216 transcripts that code for hypothetical proteins with unknown function. As these were within the core transcriptome, we anticipate that they represent an important set of transcribed genes for E. chaffeensis replication.",
                                "Transcription from large numbers of genes in ECH_0379 mutant was found to be reduced compared to wildtype. Genes representing antiporters, ABC transporters, chaperons, metabolic enzymes, and transcription regulators are among the down-regulated genes (Table 4). We predict that the mutation in the anti-porter protein gene caused a metabolic depression. Antiporter and transport proteins play an important role in the transport of ions and solutes across the cell membranes of bacteria. Antiporters are integral membrane proteins that perform secondary transport of Na+ and/or K+ for H+ across a phospholipid membrane. The E. chaffeensis genome contains several genes having homology to antiporter proteins or their subunits, suggesting that they are needed for the pathogen's intraphagosomal replication and survival in a host. In particular, antiporters aid bacteria in maintaining pH, salt, and temperature conditions. We observed a significant decline in transcription of antiporter genes such as monovalent cation/H+antiporter subunit C (ECH_0469) and ECH_0466. Disrupting the antiporter function or preventing their expression may affect the pathogen's growth in vivo. Indeed, mutation in the ECH_0379 gene resulted in the attenuated growth of the organism in both an incidental host (dog) and in the reservoir host (white-tailed deer). ABC transporters also are involved in uptake of ions and amino acids and may play an important role in a pathogen's ability to infect and survive in a host cell environment. The ECH_0379 mutant had low levels of transcriptional activity of the genes ECH_0517 and ECH_0972 encoding for ABC transporters, which function at different stages in the pathogenesis of infection. These proteins promote the survival of pathogens in the host microenvironments. The mutation possibly interferes with transport mechanisms, thereby affecting its ability to infect and survive in host cells. The mutation may have also caused alterations to the transcriptions of genes involved in physiological responses, such as regulating the pathogen's metabolic activities. We also found down-regulation of several transcripts encoding for metabolic enzymes: glutamate-cysteine ligase, DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein family protein, ATPase, uroporphyrinogen-III synthase, diaminopimelate decarboxylase, biotin-acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ligase, and argininosuccinate lyase. In general, a pathogen's survival in an intracellular environment depends on its ability to derive nutrients from the host cell. Pathogenic bacteria use metabolic pathways and virulence-associated factors that undermine the host immune system so that they can derive nutrients from their host cells. It is possible that the downregulation of the transcripts from the aforementioned genes in the ECH_0379 mutant hampers the bacterial metabolic response and its capacity to derive nutrients from the host. The mutation also caused decreased expression of genes encoding DNA replication and repair protein, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, dimethyladenosine transferase, and leucyl-tRNA synthetase. This may have also contributed to defects in pathogen's intracellular growth and survival. Our prior studies suggest that despite the mutant's attenuated growth, it failed to offer complete protection against wildtype infection challenge. If the changes in the transcriptome correlate with changes in the proteome, variations in the mutant organisms' protein expression relative to the wildtype E. chaffeensis may result in an altered host response, thus making the host less effective in initiating a protective host response when exposed to the mutant organisms.",
                                "Pathogenic bacteria produce T4SS effectors to weaken the host cell gene expression and contributes to bacterial virulence. RNA seq data suggested declined expressions of various T4SS component protein gene transcripts in ECH_0490 mutant. We also observed decreased transcription of chaperone proteins and several genes involved in the transcription and translational machinery, and exonuclease and DNA-binding regulator gene transcripts in the ECH_0490 mutant strain. On the contrary, ClpB (a major stress response heat shock protein) and RpoH (stress response RNA polymerase transcriptional subunit) showed increased transcription in the mutant.",
                                "Chaperone proteins play a key role in protein disaggregation and in aiding the pathogen to overcome the likely host cell-induced stress. ClpB reactivates aggregated proteins accumulating under stress conditions and it was abundantly expressed during replication stage of E. chaffeensis. Preventing or reducing protein aggregation and the associated protein inactivation during the bacterial growth within a host cell may benefit the pathogen in enhancing its survival. The RNA polymerase transcription regulator, RpoH, is also important for the pathogen's continued growth as it aids in promoting the expression of stress response proteins. Consistent with the prediction, increased expression of ClpB and RpoH was observed in the current study for ECH_0490 mutant. The enhanced expression from these two important genes likely enables the mutant to grow similarly to wildtype E. chaffeensis in vertebrate and tick hosts, as reported in our previous studies. Outer membrane proteins perform a variety of functions such as invasion, transport, immune response, and adhesion that are vital to the survival of Ehrlichia species, including E. chaffeensis and E. ruminantium in a host. The ECH_0490 mutant had increased abundance of OMPs compared to wildtype organisms. We found seven transmembrane genes coding for immunodominant P28/OMP family of proteins (OMP_p28, OMP_p28-2, OMP-1B, and OMP-1N) and membrane proteins (ECH_0039, ECH_0009, and ECH_0230) to be upregulated. Significant changes in the abundance of the outer membrane proteins may be associated with overall changes in the membrane architecture, thereby altering the pathogen's susceptibility to host defense. The transcriptional changes noted in the ECH_0490 mutant may not have had any negative impact on the pathogen, as the mutant grows similar to the wildtype pathogen both in white-tailed deer (the reservoir host) and in dogs (an incidental host), and in its tick host, Amblyomma americanum. Transcriptional activity assessment of the genes ECH_0490 (lipoic acid synthetase) and ECH_0492 (putative phosphate ABC transporter), both of which are located up and down stream to the transposon insertion mutation, respectively, suggested that the mutation has no effect on these genes' transcription. The diverse changes in the transcriptome of the mutant, while having no impact near the mutation site, suggest that the mutation impacted global gene expression and yet did not adversely affect the pathogen's survival in vertebrate and tick hosts.",
                                "The most notable observation was the apparent minimal variation in the transcriptome of the ECH_0660 mutant compared to the wildtype E. chaffeensis. Importantly, mutation within ECH_0660 gene causes severe growth defects in vivo in vertebrate hosts. Further, infection with this mutant also initiates a strong host response and confers protection against wildtype pathogen infection challenge. In the current study, we observed only minor changes in the gene expression in this mutant compared to wildtype. The minor changes in gene expression included genes encoding for putative nitrogen regulation protein, ABC transporter, heme exporter protein and GroES, but the variations were significantly less compared to numerous changes described in the previous two mutants. Together, these data suggest that the mutation in ECH_0660 gene led to fewer transcriptional alterations. Assuming that the proteomes of the wild type and mutant strains of E. chaffeensis are similarly altered as the transcriptomes, then ECH_0660 mutant proteome may be very similar to the wildtype bacterium. The greater degree of similarity between this mutant and the wildtype may enable the vertebrate hosts to recognize this mutant as closer to wildtype organism, thus inducing a stronger host response that mimics wildtype infection. The replication defect reported earlier with this mutant may have resulted due to the loss of gene expression from fewer genes such as ECH_0659 and ECH_0660, while maintaining most of the transcriptome similar to the wildtype."

                        "RNA deep sequencing studies in intracellular bacteria are still a major challenge. The RNA seq data reported here provide the first snapshot of comparative transcriptomics of E. chaffeensis. Sequencing of enriched bacterial RNA from wildtype and mutant strains yielded a high coverage of genes. A mutation in the ORF of ECH_0379 gene caused drastic down-regulation of genes leading to metabolic depression, which may have contributed to the mutant's attenuation in vertebrate hosts. While a mutation downstream to the protein coding sequence of ECH_0490 gene induced global changes in gene expression, up regulation of stress response regulatory genes may have helped the mutant survive in the vertebrate hosts and tick hosts. A mutation within ECH_0660 gene coding sequence resulted in few transcriptional changes, thus keeping the integrity of its transcriptome similar to wildtype. While the transcriptome data are suggestive of protein expression variations, additional experimental validation from protein analysis studies is necessary to confirm the results. Together, this study offers the first detailed description of transcriptome data for E. chaffeensis, suggesting that variations observed in the pathogen's ability to survive in a host and the host's ability to induce protection against the pathogen may be the result of global changes in the gene expression, which in turn may impact changes in the pathogen's proteome."
