    "title": "Over-Expression of Dopamine D<sub>2</sub>Receptor and Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channel Genes in Drug-Naive Schizophrenic Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes as Potential Diagnostic Markers",
    "date": "2005-01-01",
    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders affecting nearly 1% of the human population. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on complex clinical symptoms. The use of easily detectable peripheral molecular markers could substantially help the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. Recent studies showed that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) express subtypes of D1 and D2 subclasses of dopamine receptors. Recently, dopamine receptor D 3 (DRD3) was found to be over-expressed in schizophrenic PBL and proposed to be a diagnostic and follow-up marker for schizophrenia. In this study we screened PBL of 13 drug-naive/drug-free schizophrenic patients to identify additional markers of schizophrenia. One of the benefits of our study is the use of blood samples of non-medicated, drug-naive patients. This excludes the possibility that changes detected in gene expression levels might be attributed to the medication rather than to the disorder itself. Among others, genes for dopamine receptor D 2 (DRD2) and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir2.3) were found to be over-expressed in microarray analysis. Increased mRNA levels were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) using the SybrGreen method and dual labeled TaqMan probes. The use of both molecular markers allows a more rapid and precise prediction of schizophrenia and might help find the optimal medication for schizophrenic patients.",

                "Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances in cognitive, emo-tional and motor processes [18]. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system is thought to be one of the main reasons for the development of this disease [1]. Expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and the D2 subclass of dopamine receptor genes (D 2 , D 3 , D 4 subtypes) in immune cells, mainly in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) has been reported earlier by several authors [6,7,20,[31][32][33]. It has been suggested that these may reflect the status of the corre-sponding brain receptors. In recent years D 3 subtypes of D2 subclass of dopamine receptor genes (DRD3) were found to be up-regulated in schizophrenic PBL and proposed to be a useful peripheral marker for the identification and follow-up of schizophrenia [13,15]. Fuchs's group reported decreased mRNA level of \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17AChR) gene in PBL of schizophrenic patients [28]. These expression analysis studies were based on either dopaminergic ligand binding assays or on RNA levels detected by quantitative RT-PCR.",
                "In recent years, however, new molecular methods have been developed to analyze gene expression profiles either in a high throughput (microarray technology) or in a more precise way using quantitative realtime PCR (QRT-PCR). Several groups have reported gene expression changes in postmortem schizophrenic brain applying microarray technology [12,19,[21][22][23][24]. Identification and use of multiple peripheral molecular genetic markers would be extremely helpful for the precise early diagnosis and the follow-up of schizophrenia and for the implementation of effective therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify genes with differential expression in schizophrenic PBL using both high-throughput microarray analysis and QRT-PCR technique. We screened exclusively drug-naive/drugfree schizophrenic patients, excluding the possibility of gene expression being affected by medication."

Demographic data of schizophrenic patients and control individuals are summarized in Table 1. None of either the affected or the non-affected individuals was under antipsychotic treatment or other medication.",
                "cDNA microarray analysis was performed in order to pre-screen the expression pattern of schizophrenic PBL and to identify potential candidate peripheral marker genes. Total RNA pools of 13 affected male and female patients and 10 control individuals were reverse transcribed and hybridized onto human cDNA microarray containing 3200 human cDNA clones. Positive clones showing more than two-fold changes in their expression as compared to controls were sequenced. 2.56 \u00b1 0.26-and 6.75 \u00b1 2.3-fold increase in expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 was detected, respectively, in schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy individuals (Fig. 2).

Relative quantification using Ct values and reaction efficiency values was performed to determine the exact ratio. Each individual Ct values of both genes were normalized to internal control genes. These normalized Ct values in all individual samples were compared to the average normalized Ct values of the 5 corresponding sex matched control samples using the Pfaffl method [29].",
                "To determine the variation of DRD2 and Kir2.3 mRNA levels in the non-affected samples, the relative expression ratios of both genes in all individual healthy samples were calculated as follows. Normalized Ct values of each individual healthy sample were compared to the average normalized Ct values of the 5 corresponding sex matched control samples. The variation of relative expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes in control individuals is shown in Fig. 1. Relative mRNA levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 in the non-affected samples varied in the range of 0.39-to 2.56-fold and 0.18-to 3.54-fold, respectively, using the SybrGreen method and 0.55-to 2.42-fold and 0.67-to 2.92-fold, respectively, using the TaqMan probe method. Considering these variations of relative expression levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes in the non-affected control samples, only affected PBLs with relative expression levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 higher than any of the non-affected control were regarded as positives. Us-ing the SybrGreen method, ratios above 2.56 and 3.54 were regarded as up-regulated in the case of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes, respectively. In the case of the TaqMan protocol, ratios above 2.42 and 2.92 were regarded as up-regulated in the case of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes, respectively (Fig. 2, white dotted and black dashed lines).",
                "The DRD2 gene was found to be significantly overexpressed in 6 male and 6 female schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls in the range of 5.7-fold to 64.7-fold using the SybrGreen method. The relative expression level of the DRD2 gene of one female affected PBL (F5) was below background level. In this case a 2.1-fold over-expression could be detected. The average increase in DRD2 gene expression detected by the SybrGreen method was 21.4 \u00b1 18.5-fold (p = 0.0019) (Fig. 2(A), white bars). Using the TaqMan probe, 6 female and 5 male schizophrenic PBLs showed increased DRD2 mRNA levels (3.7-to 24.1-fold). The relative expression levels of DRD2 of one female and one male affected PBLs (F5, M7) were below the calculated background level (1.6-and 2.2-fold, respectively). The average increase in DRD2 gene expression determined by TaqMan protocol was 7.8 \u00b1 6.3-fold (p = 0.0023) (Fig. 2(A), black bars).",
                "In the case of 6 male and 6 female schizophrenic PBL, the expression level of Kir2.3 was also above the background expression level as compared to healthy controls. The ratios of Kir2.3 mRNA levels in affected versus non-affected samples varied in the range of 4to 133.6-fold using the SybrGreen method. The relative expression level of the Kir2.3 gene of one female affected PBL (F5) was below the background value (2.2-fold). The average increase in the relative expression level of Kir2.3 determined by the SybrGreen method was 22 \u00b1 34.7-fold (p = 0.0535) (Fig. 2(B), white bars). These changes in expression level were also confirmed by the method using dual labeled Taq-Man probes. 5 female and 6 male schizophrenic PBL showed increased Kir2.3 mRNA levels (2.8-to 15.8fold). In the case of 2 female affected PBLs (F1, F5), the relative expression levels of Kir2.3 were below the calculated background level (2.4-and 1.6-fold, respectively). The average increase in Kir2.3 gene expression determined by TaqMan probe was 8.2 \u00b1 4.8-fold (p = 0.0001) (Fig. 2(B), black bars). Differences in expression levels observed by the two different real-time PCR methods could be explained by the higher precision and sensitivity of the TaqMan protocol.",

The non-affected control and the affected samples were correctly classified into two separate clusters with the evident exception of the schizophrenic sample F5.

One of the benefits of our study is the use of blood samples from nonmedicated, drug-naive patients. This excludes the possibility, that changes detected in gene expression levels might be attributed to the medication instead of the disorder itself.",
                "One of the hypotheses explaining the nature of schizophrenia is based on dysfunction of dopaminer-gic system, especially an increased occupancy of D2 subclass of dopamine receptors (DR) by dopamine in schizophrenic patients [1]. Antipsychotic drugs presently used for the treatment of schizophrenia act as antagonists of D2 subclass of DRs [35]. Since dopamine interacts directly with DRD3 and DRD2 on T cells and activates integrin-mediated T cell adhesion, over-expression of these genes in T cells can serve not only as a passive diagnostic marker but can also reflect a dynamic functional interaction [17]. Increased expression of other representatives of D2 subclass of DRs, like the DRD3 gene in schizophrenic PBL has already been reported by other groups [13,15]. Medication, either typical or atypical had no effect on DRD3 expression level and medicated patients exhibited the same expression pattern. The expression level of DRD4 receptor genes was unchanged [13]. The correlation between DRD2 mRNA levels in different brain regions and in PBL has also been demonstrated in other diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia [5].",
                "DRD2 belongs to D2 subclass of DRs and is coupled to a G-protein with an inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity [2]. Receptor-activated G-proteins can either activate (Kir3.1) or inactivate inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.3) [8,25]. Several different potassium channels are known to be involved in electrical signaling in the nervous system [9]. Kir2.3 is a member of the Kir2 family of constitutively active inward rectifier K + channels carrying large inward and small outward potassium currents [27]. This asymmetry in potassium ion conductance plays a key role in the excitability of muscle cells and neurons. Dopamine (DA) directly activates, through D2 subclass of DRs, an IAP (Islet activating protein, pertussis toxin) -sensitive G protein coupled with inward rectifier potassium channels in rat substantia nigra neurons [16,37], demonstrated that DRD2 and another inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir3 form a stable functional complex both in vitro and in vivo. Gorelova et al. showed by whole cell patch-clamp study that DA depolarizes fast-spiking interneurons by suppressing an inwardly rectifying K + current via unknown DA mechanisms [10]. In an investigation of medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, Dong et al. showed that DA has a strong modulating effect on inwardly rectifying potassium currents (IRKC) [11]. They found that stimulation of both D1 and D2 subclasses of dopamine receptors produced inhibition of IRKC. These results suggest a strong association between DRs and inwardly rectifying potassium channels.",
                "The increased expression level of DRD2 gene in PBL is in agreement with other reports analyzing DRD2 mRNA levels in different brain regions. Using a quantitative RT-PCR technique, Roberts et al. detected increased expression levels for both isoforms of the DRD2 gene in some brain regions in schizophrenics as compared to controls [34]. Tallerico et al. measured elevated mRNA level of DRD2 longer isoform using quantitative competitive RT-PCR in schizophrenic postmortem frontal cortex regions in both medicated and non-medicated patients [36]. Vawter et al. screened the PBLs of five individual family members with schizophrenia comparing them to unaffected individuals in order to identify differentially expressed genes using microarray of 1128 brain related genes, but neither DRD2 nor Kir2.3 was presented on the microarray they used [38]."

                "Based on the results of the present study, it seems that the already reported central increase of DRD2 expression is reflected in PBL as well. Among the genes that were found to be differentially expressed in affected PBL by microarray method, up-regulation in the expression of two genes, DRD2 and Kir2.3 was confirmed by SybrGreen and TaqMan QRT-PCR protocols. Since neither the affected nor the non-affected individuals were under antipsychotic treatment or other medication, elevated DRD2 and Kir2.3 mRNA levels reflect the disorder itself rather than the effect of medication. Our results suggest that DRD2 and Kir2.3 can serve as additional peripheral genetic markers for the prediction of schizophrenia. To confirm these genes as potential markers, expression levels of further affected PBLs need to be analyzed. High-throughput analysis of already reported molecular markers and genes in combination with the ones presented here might promote the earlier and more precise diagnosis of this disorder. Diagnostic tests based on these results can be developed and help manage schizophrenia from the onset all the way to the chronic state."
