    "abstract": "Drug-naive and drug-free schizophrenic PBL were screened to identify additional markers that are differentially expressed compared to healthy individuals using microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) techniques. Genes for dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir2.3) were found to be overexpressed in microarray analysis. Increased mRNA levels were confirmed by QRT-PCR using SybrGreen method and dual labeled TaqMan probes.",

                        "Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances in mental, emotional and motor processes5 This complex and devastating disease affects approximately 1% of the human population.",
                        "There is an abundance of data evidencing that there is a genetic linkage of schizophrenia and that expression pattern of certain genes is altered in patients with schizophrenia. Intensive studies have been carried out to find appropriate genetic markers allowing diagnosis of schizophrenia either before development of symptoms or with an increased reliability. In general, many genes or proteins said to be a marker in schizophrenia were and, in part, are still poorly characterized or there is no convincing evidence that there is significantly different level of expression between healthy and affected individuals.",
                        "In WO 0144269 (Johnston-Wilson et al.) brain protein markers for various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, are taught. Said marker proteins have been identified by 2-D (two dimensional) gel electrophoresis.",
                        "In EP 1 348963 A1 (Cochran et al.) it is described that the gene of the voltage-gated potassium channel 3.1 (Kv3.1) \u03b1-subunit shows altered expression in schizophrenia and diagnostic and screening methods, based on this finding, are disclosed. To present inventor's knowledge this is the only report on the relation of a potassium channel protein and schizophrenia.",
                        "A useful animal model for studying Kir2.3 is described in WO02400661, wherein transgenic mice containing Kir2.3 potassium channel gene disruptions are described. However, no specific mention of use of said mice for studying schizoprenia was found in WO02400661.",
                        "One of the hypotheses explaining the nature of the disease is based on dysfunction of dopaminergic system, especially an increased occupancy of D2 subclass of dopamine receptors (DR) by dopamine in schizophrenic patients.6 Today antipsychotic drugs used in treatment of schizophrenia act as antagonists of D2 subclass of DRs.7 In U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,270 (Horn et al.) methods and labelled compounds are provided to detect altered distribution of dopamine D2 receptors in schizophrenia.",
                        "Expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and D2 subclass of dopamine receptor genes (D2, D3, D4 subtypes) in immune cells, mainly in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), has been reported earlier by several authors.1,4,8,9,10 It has been suggested, that they may reflect the status of corresponding brain receptors. In recent years, D3 subtypes of D2 subclass of dopamine receptor genes (DRD3) were found to be overexpressed in schizophrenic PBL and proposed to be a useful peripheral marker for identification and follow-up of schizophrenia.3,11 The same laboratory reported that \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17AChR) gene was also differentially expressed in schizophrenic patients, since in affected PBL a decreased mRNA level of \u03b17AChR had been detected.12 Since dopamine interacts directly with DRD3 and DRD2 on T cells and activate integrin mediated T cell adhesion, overexpression of these genes in T cells can serve not only as a passive diagnostic marker but can reflect a dynamic functional interaction.13",
                        "In recent years fast increase of sequence data and new molecular methods developed to analyze gene expression profile either in high throughput format (microarray technology) or by more precise methods (e.g. quantitative real-time PCR) promise an effective search for new markers.",
                        "In EP 1 132 483 A2 (Nawa et al.) a DNA micro-array is used as a tool for finding proteins differentially expressed in schizophrenia. Though a large number of proteins are assumed to be appropriate markers, no convincing evidence is shown in the description.",
                        "In WO 0136473 (Vogeli et al.), an extensive study of a large number of putative G-protein coupled receptors is described. Upon expression analysis, a few of them, identified only by their sequence, were proposed to be related to schizophrenia. However, no direct evidence appears to have been provided.",
                        "A microarray approach has been utilized in the finding of a decreased expression of G-protein signalling 4 (RGS4) in patients of schizophrenia, as taught in WO 0216653.",
                        "Vawter et al. screened the PBLs of five individual family members with schizophrenia with a comparison of unaffected individuals to identify differentially expressed genes using microarray of 1128 brain related genes but neither DRD2 nor Kir2.3 were presented on that microarray.35",
                        "In WO2004/082570 the use of DRD2 in a number of neurological diseases in mentioned. However, no specific suggestion can be found in relation to schizophrenia.",
                        "Though a number of possibly suitable marker genes are known in the prior art, there is still a need to identify further genes which are applicable in the diagnosis of schizophrenia or, if used in combination with known markers, enhance the reliability of existing methods.",
                        "Despite extensive studies no suggestion could be found in the prior art that a gene of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel might be a marker of schizophrenia.",
                        "Moreover, to the best of inventor's knowledge, in the prior art the use of the gene of DRD2 as a specific diagnostic marker in schizophrenia has not been not suggested.",
                        "Moreover, it has not been known that said genes or the proteins encoded by them, could be peripheral molecular markers in schizophrenia.",
                        "The object of the present invention is to provide further diagnostic markers useful in methods for diagnosing schizophrenia.",
                        "Present inventors applied both high throughput microarray analysis to pre-scan, and quantitative real-time PCR technique to identify multiple genes expressed differentially in schizophrenic PBL. Genes for DRD2 and Kir2.3 were found to be overexpressed in microarray study. Two genes from DNA microarray results were confirmed by using SybrGreen and TaqMan probes in quantitative real-time PCR. Since neither affected nor non-affected individuals were under antipsychotic or other medication treatment, elevated mRNA levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 reflect the disorder itself, not the effect of medication. Combination of multiple peripheral molecular genetic markers would be extremely helpful for precise early diagnosis, follow-up of schizophrenia and in decision of effective therapy."

                        "Below certain embodiments of the invention are illustrated in more detail by way of examples. It is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not restricted to these examples.",
                        "The invention pertains to novel biochemical methods for diagnosing schizophrenia and is based on the finding that genes encoding the dopamine D2 receptor DRD2 and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.3 are upregulated in patients of schizophrenia.",
                        "DRD2 belongs to the D2 subclass of DRs and is coupled to G-protein with an inhibiting effect of adenyl cyclase activity.27 Receptor-activated G-proteins can either activate (Kir3.1) or inactivate inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.3).28,29 Several different potassium channels are known to be involved in electrical signaling in the nervous system. Kir2.3 is a member of Kir2 family of constitutively active inwardly rectifier K+ channels carrying large inward and small outward potassium current.30 This asymmetry in potassium ion conductance plays a key role in the excitability of muscle cells and neurons. DA (dopamine) through D2 subclass of DRs directly activates an IAP (Islet activating protein, pertussis toxin)-sensitive G protein coupled with inward rectifier potassium channels in rat substantia nigra neurones.31 Lavine et al. demonstrated that DRD2 and another inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir3, form a stable functional complex both in vitro and in vivo.32 Though the present invention is by no means to be limited by any theory behind, these results suggest a strong association between DRs and inwardly rectifying potassium channels.",
                        "In one embodiment of the invention the expression level of either the gene encoding DRD2 or the gene encoding Kir2.3 or both is assessed in a biological sample taken from a subject. The expression level determined in the biological sample is compared to a baseline expression level of the respective gene, typical of healthy subjects. If the gene expression level in the biological sample is higher than the baseline level, this finding is considered as an indication of the fact that the subject suffers in or is susceptible to schizophrenia.",
                        "In an other embodiment the level of either a DRD2 protein or a Kir2.3 protein is assessed in a biological sample taken from a subject. The level of the protein(s) in the biological sample is compared to a baseline level value of the respective protein typical in healthy subjects. If the level in the biological sample is higher than the baseline level the finding is considered as an indication of the fact that the subject suffers in or is susceptible to schizophrenia.",
                        "It is to be emphasized that other markers of schizophrenia have been known in the art, examples for which are listed in the introductory part of the present description. The present novel markers also can be used together with the known markers improving the reliability of diagnosis.",
                        "The baseline expression level can be the expression level of the same gene in a healthy, i.e. non-schizophrenic, subject. More preferably the baseline level is defined as an average of expression levels of a reference group of healthy subjects. It may be advisable if the reference group is selected carefully an the subjects in this group and the subject to be diagnosed advantageously match each other in respect of certain characteristics, e.g. race, age, sex etc, though our results suggest that variations within healthy subjects are usually smaller than the differences between healthy and schizophrenic subjects. The baseline level is expediently defined relative to a suitable control, e.g. an internal reference control. Alternatively, for a more general use the reference group of subjects should be sufficiently diverse in terms of age, sex, social status, geographical distribution, previous drug and medical histories, etc. and of sufficient size to provide a meaningful statistical value. In this way expression of the diagnostic marker genes or proteins of the invention is measured in the set of samples representing the \u201cnormal\u201d population. Baseline level value is calculated from a statistic of these results.",
                        "Biological samples can be taken from any tissue showing differential expression of the marker genes or proteins of the invention. Such tissues can be, though not exclusively and not under any circumstances, brain, spinal cord, lymphatic fluid, blood etc. Methods for obtaining sample and preparing them for measurements are well known in the art.",
                        "The skilled person has known for a long time a number of methods for quantitative detection of proteins levels or of gene expression levels in a sample. All these methods may be applicable in the invention.",
                        "In one embodiment of such a detection scheme, a cDNA molecule is synthesized from an RNA molecule of interest (e.g. by reverse transcription of the RNA molecule into cDNA). A sequence within the cDNA is then used as the template for a nucleic acid amplification reaction, such as a PCR amplification reaction, or the like. The nucleic acid reagents used as primers in the reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification steps of this method are chosen from DRD2 and Kir2.3 gene nucleic acid reagents. Those skilled in the art are familiar with techniques for designing and obtaining suitable primers (see the Examples).",
                        "Additionally, it is possible to perform such gene expression assays \u201cin situ\u201d, i.e. directly upon tissue sections (fixed and/or frozen) of patient tissue obtained from biopsies or resections, such that no nucleic acid purification is necessary. Nucleic acid reagents may be used as probes and/or primers for such in situ procedures. Alternatively, if a sufficient quantity of the appropriate cells can be obtained, standard Northern analysis can be performed to determine the level of mRNA expression of the marker genes.",
                        "However, recently, certain relatively new method have gained widespread applicability.",
                        "As demonstrated by the Examples below, one technique for establishing baseline levels may involve real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). A variety of RT-PCR methods are known by the skilled person such as the methods described or referred in the Real Time PCR Special Issue of the METHODS Journal (Elsevier, December 2001, Volume 25, Issue 4. pages 383 to 481).",
                        "According to another embodiment of the present invention, when protein levels are assessed, antibodies which specifically recognize either DRD2 or Kir2.3 are produced. The antibodies are used alone or in combination. The level of binding of antibodies which specifically recognize the proteins will be higher in schizophrenic individuals than in normal individuals. An antibody against the Kir2.3. protein is described e.g. by Noam et al (1996)46.",
                        "In order to normalize the level of binding to the total amount of proteins present in the tissue, the binding of the specific antibodies can be expressed relative to the binding of an antibody to a reference protein equally expressed in normal and diseased subjects.",
                        "In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the determination of the amount of modified and unmodified receptors can be made by isolation, e.g. partial isolation of the receptor protein or the potassium channel protein itself. Effective methods for isolation are gel electrophoresis, e.g. two dimensional gel electrophoresis, or isoelectric focusing techniques. A combination of these techniques with blotting techniques or other methods of immunological detection may provide an efficient tool for assessing the concentrations of quantities of the proteins in given samples. The isolated or partially purified proteins may be subjected to analysis of peptide fragments, obtained e.g. by proteolitic enzymes, which carry special properties e.g. may contain a site suitable for specific chemical modification.",
                        "According to an alternative embodiment the activity of the marker receptor protein DRD2 or the potassium channel Kir2.3 is measures as a value indicative of the level of said protein. Methods for determination of inward rectifier K+ currents and further methods to detect Kir2.3 are described e.g. in Noam et al (1996)46 and Bannister et al. (1999)47 and publications referred therein.",
                        "When the level of the marker protein or the marker gene is obtained and compared to the baseline level a certain threshold value can be determined above which the levels in samples from the diagnosed subjects are accepted as indicative of schizophrenia. This threshold value may depend on a variety of factors, including the measurement method, reliability of the baseline level, statistical (mathematical) considerations and the aim of the diagnosis (i.e. that the development of the disease has to be decided with certainty or only a susceptibility is to be ascertained) etc. As an extreme value, the baseline may coincide with the threshold value. Determination of levels above this threshold value may be indicative of the severity of the disease.",
                        "Advantageously, when a concrete method is optimized, a set of diseased subjects is also assayed to determine validity of the test by comparing results of the diseased sample to those of the normal sample.",
                        "Diagnostic kits are well known in the art. In particular, a number of diagnostic kits are available and are described in the prior art cited in the present description. Any of these kits can be used as analogue of the kits of the invention taking into account the specific features of the invention taught herein.",

                                "cDNA microarray analysis was performed in order to pre-screen expression pattern of schizophrenic PBL and to identify potential candidate peripheral marker genes. Genes with altered expression were subjected to further analysis using QRT-PCR with SybrGreen dye and dual labeled TaqMan probes. Total RNA pool of 13 affected male and female patients and 10 control individuals were reverse transcribed and hybridized onto human cDNA microarray containing 3200 human cDNA clones. Positive clones showing more than two-fold change in their expression compared to controls were sequenced. Among others, 2.56\u00b10.26- and 6.75\u00b12.3-fold increase in expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 was detected, respectively, in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy individuals (FIG. 2). Based on this preliminary data and considering the potential role of these genes in pathogenesis of schizophrenia, expression levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes were subjected to further analysis.",

                                "After reverse transcription of 13 individual total RNA samples of affected and 10 non-affected individuals, QRT-PCR was performed on cDNA templates mixed with primers and TaqMan probes specific for DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes. \u03b2-actin or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) genes were used as internal reference controls. Relative quantification using Ct values and reaction efficiency values was performed to determine the exact ratio between the normalized Ct values of both genes in all individual affected samples compared to the average values calculated from Ct values of the 5-5 sex matched individual control samples.",
                                "To determine the variation of DRD2 and Kir2.3 mRNA levels in the non-affected samples, relative expression levels of both genes were calculated. The variation of relative expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes in control samples is shown in FIG. 1. Relative mRNA level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 in non-affected samples were changed in a range of 0.39- to 2.56-fold and 0.18- to 3.54-fold, respectively, using the SybrGreen method and 0.55- and 2.42-fold and 0.67- to 2.92-fold, respectively, using TaqMan probe method. Considering these variations of relative expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes in non-affected control samples, a background level of relative expression was calculated. Only affected PBLs with relative expression level of DRD2 and Kir2.3 higher than any of the non-affected control were regarded as positives. Using SybrGreen method, ratios above 2.56 and 3.54 were regarded as up-regulated in the case of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes, respectively. In the case of TaqMan protocol, ratios above 2.42 and 2.92 were regarded as up-regulated in the case of DRD2 and Kir2.3 genes, respectively (FIG. 2, white dotted and black dashed lines).",

Relative expression level of DRD2 gene of one female affected PBL (F5) was under the background level. In this case a 2.1-fold overexpression could be detected. The average increase of DRD2 gene expression detected by the SybrGreen method was 21.4\u00b118.5-fold (p=0.0019) (FIG. 2, A, white bars). Using TaqMan probe, 6 female and 5 male schizophrenic PBLs showed increased mRNA level of DRD2 gene (3.7- to 24.1-fold). Relative expression levels of DRD2 of one female and one male affected PBLs (F5, M7) were under the calculated background level (1.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively). The average increase of DRD2 gene expression analyzed by TaqMan protocol was 7.8\u00b16.3-fold (p=0.0023) (FIG. 2A, black bars).",

Ratios of mRNA level of Kir2.3 in affected versus non-affected sample were varied in a range of 4- to 133.6-fold using the SybrGreen method. Relative expression level of Kir2.3 gene of one female affected PBL (F5) was under the background value (2.2-fold). The average increase of relative expression level of Kir2.3 analyzed by SybrGreen method was 22\u00b134.7-fold (p=0.0535) (FIG. 2B, white bars). These changes in expression level were confirmed by the method using dual labeled TaqMan probes as well. 5 female and 6 male schizophrenic PBL showed increased mRNA level of Kir2.3 gene (2.8- to 15.8-fold). In case of 2 female affected PBLs (F1, F5), relative expression levels of Kir2.3 were under the calculated background level (2.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively). The average increase of Kir2.3 gene expression analyzed by TaqMan probe was 8.2\u00b14.8-fold (p=0.0001) (FIG. 2B, black bars). Differences in expression levels observed by the two different real-time PCR methods could be explained by the more precise and sensitive features of the TaqMan protocol.",

                                "To determine similarity groups of gene expression dataset, agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied. The non-affected control and affected samples were correctly classified into two separate clusters with the evident exception of the schizophrenic sample F5. There was no significant differences between relative expression levels of female and male patients (FIG. 3).",
                                "Among the genes that were found to be differently expressed in affected PBL by microarray method, up-regulation in expression of two genes, DRD2 and Kir2.3 were confirmed by SybrGreen and TaqMan probes based QRT-PCR. Since neither affected nor non-affected individuals were under antipsychotic or other medication treatment, elevated mRNA levels of DRD2 and Kir2.3 reflect the disorder itself, not the effect of medication. Thus, DRD2 and Kir2.3 can serve as additional peripheral genetic markers for prediction of schizophrenia. High-throughput analysis of already reported molecular markers and genes in combination with the presented ones help the earlier and more precise diagnosis of this disorder. Diagnostic tests based on these results can be developed and help manage schizophrenia from the beginning to the chronic state.",
