    "abstract": "A resonant gyroscope apparatus has a decoupling mechanism implemented with spring-like flexure members to effectively isolate an axis-symmetric bulk-acoustic wave (BAW) vibratory gyroscope from its substrate, thereby minimizing the effect that external sources of error have on offset and scale-factor. The spring-like structure enables degeneracy of in-plane resonance modes of the annulus and aids in decoupling the in-plane and out-of-plane resonance modes of the resonant annulus, thereby enabling the mode-matched and/or near mode-matched operation of the structure as a vibratory gyroscope in the pitch, roll and yaw-modes. In various embodiments, the decoupling mechanism may be coupled to either an interior or exterior perimeter of an annulus shaped resonator element of the gyroscope",

                        "Micro-machined vibratory gyroscopes are increasingly used in applications that require large dynamic range and large bandwidth such as gaming controllers and smart user interfaces. The popularity of such gyroscopes has grown, in large part, due to their low cost, small size, robustness and low power consumption, attributes which had been hardly achievable with conventional gyroscopes. One such gyroscopic device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,543,496, entitled \u201cBulk Acoustical Wave Gyroscope,\u201d the subject matter which is incorporated herein by this reference for all purposes.",
                        "Micro-machined gyroscopes have thus enabled a myriad of applications that range from basic motion detection for gaming, to safety control systems in automobiles. More recently, an increased interest in the use of MEMS inertial sensors for dead reckoning and pedestrian navigation in hand-held electronics has placed stringent requirements in die size, power consumption and overall performance of this type of devices. As of today, most commercially available rate sensors are designed as low-frequency flexural tuning-fork gyroscopes (TFGs), which are typically sensitive to random vibration and prone to linear acceleration (such as the one experienced under shock). These limitations complicate the use of TFG technology in large-volume high-end applications, particularly in personal navigation, where dependencies on fluctuations in the environment translate into long-term drift at the output of the system. Recently, concerns about the high sensitivity of consumer-grade gyroscopes to low-frequency pressure signals that can be used to recover audio have been raised as a potential threat for eavesdropping, justifying the need for more environmentally-robust rotation sensors.",
                        "Acceleration suppression mechanisms can be implemented in TFGs to alleviate part of this problem by utilizing redundant proof-masses that reject shock and vibration as common-mode signals. However, this compensation technique results in a significant increase in size, and could require electromechanical calibration to compensate for fabrication imperfections, making them more suitable in low-volume systems.",
                        "As an alternative, the degenerate modes of bulk-acoustic wave (BAW) resonators can be used to implement axis-symmetric mode-matched gyroscopes operating in the MHz range with high quality factors at moderate vacuum levels (1 to 10 Torr). Given their high-frequency nature, BAW gyros inherently reject the effects of random vibrations in the environment and are highly immune to shock.",
                        "However, like in any other type of gyroscope, differences in the loss mechanisms of the two degenerate modes can lead to damping coupling, which result in unwanted environment-dependent offset variations. In axis-symmetric gyros, fabrication or material imperfections can cause different support-loss rates for each of the modes, particularly if implemented in anisotropic substrates such as (100) single-crystal silicon (SCS).",

This is achieved by effectively decoupling the resonant structure of the gyroscope from the substrate, which serves to isolate the structure from external unwanted stimuli, and reduces the environment-dependent discrepancies of the loss mechanisms of the two modes of the gyroscope. Discrepancies in the loss mechanisms of the modes leads to mode-to-mode coupling, which translates into bias at the output of the gyroscope. Thus, reducing differences between the modes is important.",

A novel decoupling mechanism implemented with flexure members is utilized to effectively isolate an axis-symmetric bulk-acoustic wave (BAW) vibratory gyroscope from its substrate, thereby minimizing the effect that external sources of error have on offset and scale-factor. The disclosed high-frequency gyroscope may be used for z-axis rate detection and combines the properties of a BAW sensor with an isolation substrate-decoupling structure in order to significantly reduce anchor-loss in the system.

Having q2k(t) always in quadrature with respect to the signal of interest facilitates its rejection by the use of I-Q demodulation in the sense electronics. Additionally, stiffness coupling can be effectively cancelled by the use of electrostatic forces similar to the ones used to mode-match the part.

The as-born behavior of the device shows both a frequency split and a mode-to-mode stiffness coupling due to small fabrication imperfections, as shown in FIG. 3A. By the use of electrostatic forces located in between the antinodes of the two modes, the stiffness coupling terms of the device can be cancelled out, as shown in FIG. 3B. Similarly, by the use of forces aligned with the antinodes of one of the two modes, the frequency split can be brought down to zero, restoring the degeneracy of the device, as shown in FIG. 3C.",

                                "The first term on the left side of expression (4), Qviscous\u22121, corresponds to losses associated with viscous damping caused by the interaction between the resonator and the gas surrounding the structure. By operating at high vacuum levels, these losses can be significantly minimized. The second term (QTED\u22121) is the energy lost because of the interaction of the mechanical resonances with the thermal modes of the structure; the mechanical and thermal domains are coupled to each other through the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) leading to thermoelastic damping (TED). For the case of degenerate modes of axis-symmetric gyroscopes, the value of TED for both modes is almost identical because the structure is perfectly symmetric. This leads to minimum TED coupling between the modes. In the case of TFG-like devices, the flexures should be properly designed to match the loss mechanisms. The factor Qsurface\u22121 is related to scattering losses due to roughness in the device surface. This effect is minimized through fabrication processing steps to avoid major asymmetric contributions to the system losses. The next parameter (Qmaterial\u22121) is associated with other intrinsic losses of the material, such as phonon-phonon interactions, phonon-electron interactions, defects, impurities, dislocations, etc. These losses are typically low, particularly in the case of materials such as single-crystal silicon. The last term (Qanchor\u22121) corresponds to the energy dissipated from the resonator through its anchor point. Larger anchor dissipation also translates into higher coupling between resonating structure and the substrate. Thus, in gyroscopes with high anchor losses, environmental stimuli coming from the substrate will couple into the system causing an unwanted response. Furthermore, if the changes between the drive and sense modes are asymmetric, i.e., Q1-anchor\u22121 and Q2-anchor\u22121 vary differently, the gyroscope will experience environment-dependent damping coupling.",
