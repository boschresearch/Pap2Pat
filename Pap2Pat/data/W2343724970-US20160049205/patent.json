    "abstract": "Technologies are generally provided for methods and circuitry to rank a large number of cells in a timeframe of about one sense cycle. In some examples, an architecture may be implemented to rank memory cells such as volatile memories, non-volatile memories, and other types of data storage devices, where there may not be an equivalent to threshold voltage. In other examples, an arbitrary group of circuits, such as in neural networks where there may not be an equivalent control gate to set the timing resolution, may be ranked. Relative sense timing may be used to rank the cells having different current carrying abilities. A ramped gate voltage may be used to control the timing resolution and to reduce contention between close separate cells. Digital logic may be used to latch and/or record the rank information.",

                        "Rank modulation is a scheme that uses the relative order of cell levels to represent data. Rank modulation may be implemented in flash memories, phase-change memories, and other circuits. A challenge with rank modulation for multilevel flash memory is that to be competitive with standard multilevel flash memories, large number of cells may need to be grouped into sets and ranked together. For example to replace a 3 bit/cell NAND flash memory in terms of storage density, sets of 20 cells or more may have to be used. To rank N cells, a conventional algorithm may include approximately N iterations. In each iteration, ranking circuitry may compare a level of all the cells within a set simultaneously and indicate which one has the highest level. Thus, the relatively slow reading (or ranking) process for ranking modulation based flash memory may be an impediment to its implementation."

In some examples, an architecture may be implemented to rank memory cells such as volatile memories, non-volatile memories, and other types of data storage devices, where there may not be an equivalent to threshold voltage.

                        "FIG. 1 diagrammatically illustrates an example rank modulation based on relative orders of cell levels, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.",
                        "Diagram 100 shows four example memory cells: A 102, B 104, C 106, and D 108 prior to a change in programming, and after programming, where cells A 112 and B 114 preserve their stored content while cells C 116 and D 118 change their stored content. The respective level in each cell, which represents their stored content, may be in the form of a voltage level or charge level, for example, in the cell.",
                        "Applying rank modulation to the example cells in diagram 100, an order of the four cells may be (B D C A). Cell B may be the highest programmed level, and cell A may be the lowest. To write a new value, for example, (C B D A), memory cell C may need to be increased beyond B. Likewise, a second write to the same location of the value (D C B A) may need increasing stored value in cell D, as long as there is still enough headroom in the cell(s). In this manner, small changes to stored information or stored values within a block may be performed without copying or erasing the block. Thus, the change of memory content may be faster than conventional encoding, and a lifetime of the memory may be extended by avoiding the high voltages associated with the erasure process.",
                        "Rank modulation may also reduce a risk of over-programming. Conventional programming approaches may avoid over-programming by repeatedly injecting small amounts of charge into a cell and measuring the cell's level until the target absolute cell level is achieved. Overshooting the target level may involve erasing the memory block and repeating the programming of the entire block. To avoid such a penalty, writing to multi-level (e.g., greater than four levels) cells may be rather conservative and thus slow. Because rank modulation may not use the absolute values, the memory cells may be safely programmed in a less conservative way, which may lead to substantially faster writing speeds. Flash memories with rank modulation may also tolerate charge leakage better than standard encoding schemes. In flash memories, the cells may lose their charge gradually, resulting in a decrease in their programmed levels. Because the cell levels decrease at relatively similar rate, the absolute values of the cell levels may change substantially faster than the rank order of the cell levels. Thus, conventional encoding schemes may not tolerate charge leakage as well as rank modulation.",
                        "Embodiments may be implemented in volatile, non-volatile, and other types of memory devices, as well as various types of circuitry that involve ranking as part of their operation such as neural networks.",

                        "An example system architecture 200 of FIG. 2 includes blocks of memory cells 204 and 214 arranged above and below a set of encoder circuitry 206, 210 and readout circuitry 208, which in turn may be centrally located relative to the blocks of memory cells 204 and 214. The encoder circuitry 206 and 210 coupled to the blocks of memory cells 204 and 241 may also perform rank determination operations (and are therefore labeled as \u201cRank Determination/Encoder\u201d elements in FIG. 2). The blocks of memory cells 204 and 214 may be coupled to or otherwise associated with respective address decoders 202 and 212.

Each set, such as set 230, may include multiple floating gate cells 232. The example architecture 200 is for illustration purposes only and other architectures are possible in other embodiments. A memory architecture or similar circuit architecture with rank determination according to embodiments may be implemented using other configurations, components, and arrangements.",

Each set, which may include an array of floating gate (FG) transistor memory cells, may form the primitive unit of the rank modulation memory. The number of FG cells in a set may impact a capacity of rank modulation memories.",
                        "According to some example embodiments, rank determination circuitry may include a voltage or a current sense block coupled to each column of memory cells and a digital block coupled to all columns of memory cells. The digital block may turn on a reset line to discharge rows of memory cells to initiate a determination of a relative sense timing of the memory cells, select a row of the memory cells such that current flows to charge the respective columns, a pass voltage may then be applied to all the unselected rows, and determine the relative sense timing based on detection of a fastest rising bit line voltage among columns of memory cells. The digital block of the rank determination circuitry may then rank the memory cells based on relative sense timing information for the memory cells. Alternatively or additionally, the columns may be pre-charged to a preset voltage, a pass voltage may then be applied to all the unselected rows, and the gate voltage of a selected row may be ramped up until the memory cells start to conduct and discharge the columns. The relative timing of the discharge time may be used to rank the order of the memory cell in this set.",

Row select lines 314 coupled to and for each row of FETs may enable selection of rows to initiate current flow (charging) into bit lines (columns) for each selected row. The terms column and bit line are used interchangeably herein. FETs 316, 318, 320, etc. coupled to and/or included in each column may be used to optionally turn off each column after the bit lines and the optional charge storage blocks (capacitors 334, 336, 338, etc. coupled to or included in each column) are charged to a pre-specified level. Sense amplifiers 322, 324, 326, etc. coupled to or included in each column may be used as current or voltage sense devices and are set to trigger at a pre-specified level. The last row of FETs 328, 330, 332, etc. may be coupled to the capacitors 334, 336, 338, etc. in parallel and may provide a connection to reset/discharge line 340.

Ranking may begin with turning on the reset to discharge the bit lines (columns). Next, the selected row may be turned on, the unselected rows set at a bypass voltage, and current may begin to flow to charge the bit lines and the optional capacitors. This may result in the voltages on the bit lines rising. In some embodiments, the voltage on the row select line may be ramped in linear, staircase, or exponential or other manner in order to enhance a separation of the rank order. In other embodiments, the selected row may be enabled in a pulsed fashion to allow more time for the digital block to process data.",

The level at which the sense amplifiers trigger may be adjustable. The triggering of the sense device may be recorded by the digital block (for example, a flip-flop may be triggered). The digital block may also store this rank and stream the data out. In further embodiments, feedback circuitry may be used to turn off the column. Remaining columns may keep on charging until the next sense circuitry triggers, etc. In yet other embodiments, the ranking data may be buffered and shifted out at the end of the sense period. In yet other embodiments, the voltage ramp rate on the row select line may be adaptive adjusted based on the condition of the digital block, including the status of the buffer and/or the status of the data streaming process. In yet further embodiments, a counter maybe employed to count the number of columns, which are triggered, and stop the reading process when all columns (except the last one) are completed.",
