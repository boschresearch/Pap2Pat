                        "Organisms have evolved multiple mechanisms to maintain genome integrity. As the cellular genome is constantly exposed to environmental damage, multiple DNA damage repair pathways exist to protect the genome from harmful or potentially catastrophic alterations. Double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways are highly conserved between eukaryotes including mammalian species. Non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous-directed recombination (HDR) are two major DNA repair pathways that can either act in concert or antagonistic manner. HDR is a pathway which uses template DNA such as an intact sister chromosomal copy or an exogenous donor to repair the DSBs, and thus can robustly generate perfect repair. However, HDR efficiency depends on species, cell type and the stage of the cell cycles. In mammalian cells, NHEJ has been considered the major pathway to repair the DNA, whereas HDR is more common in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NHEJ is an imperfect process, which often leads to gain or loss of a few nucleotides at each end of the breakage site. This character can lead to subsequent deleterious genetic alteration that results in cellular malfunctioning, cancer or aging. The DNA repair enzymes KU70, KU80, and Ligase IV (LIG4) play central roles in NHEJ-mediated DNA repair, whereas KU70 and KU80 proteins stabilize the DNA ends and put them in physical proximity to facilitate end ligation performed by LIG4. On the other hand, proteins such as BRCA1/2, RAD50, RAD51 and various cell cycle regulators are directly involved in HDR, although the pathway has yet to be fully characterized.",
                        "The type II bacterial adaptive immune system, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) is a powerful genome editing tool. The Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) complex induces site-specific DSBs, which can be repaired by either of the two main DNA repair pathways, NHEJ and HDR. The error-prone repairs by NHEJ often introduce unpredictable frame shift insertions and deletions (indels), leading to loss-of-function of target genes. In contrast, HDR can either generate perfect DNA repair or precise genome modification guided by donor templates. However, HDR is substantially less efficient compared to NHEJ in mammalian cells and most often restricted to S/G2 phase(s) of the cell cycle. Owning to the importance of HDR in mediating precise genetic modification, extensive efforts have been made to change the balance of DNA repair pathways. However, due to the intricacy of the DNA repair pathways, the available tools to enhance HDR are still limited to a few choices with relatively small effect. Moreover, little success to date has been achieved to directly augment the HDR pathway itself. Thus, manipulation of both HDR and NHEJ using simple genetic tools might enable or strengthen a variety of genome editing applications.",

                                "CRISPR systems have been proven as versatile tools for site-specific genome engineering in mammalian species. During the gene editing processes, these RNA-guide nucleases introduce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), in which non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) dominates the DNA repair pathway, limiting the efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR), the alternative pathway essential for precise gene targeting. Multiple approaches have been developed to enhance HDR, including chemical compound or RNA interference mediated inhibition of NHEJ factors, small molecule activation of HDR enzymes, or cell cycle timed delivery of CRISPR complex. However, these approaches face multiple challenges, yet have moderate or variable effects. Herein, a new approach was developed that programs both NHEJ and HDR pathways with CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) to achieve significantly enhanced HDR efficiency of CRISPR mediated gene editing. The manipulation of NHEJ and HDR pathway components, such as CtIP, CDK1, KU70, KU80 and LIG4, was performed with dead guide RNAs (dgRNAs), thus relying on only a single catalytically active Cas9 to perform CRISPRa/i as well as precise gene editing. While reprogramming of most DNA repair factors or their combinations tested enhanced HDR efficiency, simultaneously activating CDK1 and repressing KU80 has strongest effect with nearly 4-8-fold improvement. Doxycycline-induced dgRNA-based CRISPRa/i programming of DNA repair enzymes as well as viral packaging enabled flexible and tunable HDR enhancement in mammalian cells. This study provides an effective, flexible and safer strategy to enhance precise genome modifications, which broadly impacts human gene editing and therapy.",
                                "As described herein, the compositions and methods described herein provide many advantages including but not limited to: 1) the manipulation of NHEJ and HDR pathway components, such as CtIP, CDK1, KU70, KU80 and LIG4, was performed with a dead guide RNA (dgRNA), thus relying on only a single catalytically active Cas9 to perform CRISPRa/i as well as precise gene editing. 2) Reprogramming of most DNA repair factors or combinations tested enhanced HDR efficiency. 3) With simultaneously activation of CDK1 by dgRNA-MS2:MPH and/or repression of KU80 by dgRNA-Com:CK, the HDR efficiency can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude (upto 13 fold enhancement in two independent cell lines, one of the strongest effect among all methods available). 4) This is a genetic approach; thus the components can join force with an armamentarium of other genetic tools such as inducible gene expression modules via simple genetic engineering. 5) The CRISPRa/i constructs can be packaged into viral vectors for efficient delivery into a large repertoire of cell types. 6) Finally, this approach of HDR enhancement thus can be easily adapted for in vivo settings, which is essential for the application of gene therapy."

As demonstrated herein, dgRNAs together with the associated CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) modules are deployed to achieve HDR enhancement using a single active Cas9.",

The HNH and RuvC domains are nuclease domains. Guide RNA is engineered to have a 5\u2032 end that is complementary to the target DNA sequence. Upon binding of the guide RNA to the Cas9 protein, a conformational change occurs activating the protein. Once activated, Cas9 searches for target DNA by binding to sequences that match its protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. A PAM is a two or three nucleotide base sequence within one nucleotide downstream of the region complementary to the guide RNA. In one non-limiting example, the PAM sequence is 5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032. When the Cas9 protein finds its target sequence with the appropriate PAM, it melts the bases upstream of the PAM and pairs them with the complementary region on the guide RNA.

Full complementarity is not necessarily required, provided there is sufficient complementarity to cause hybridization and promote formation of a CRISPR complex. A target sequence may comprise any polynucleotide, such as a DNA or a RNA polynucleotide. In certain embodiments, a target sequence is located in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a cell. In other embodiments, the target sequence may be within an organelle of a eukaryotic cell, for example, mitochondrion or nucleus. Typically, in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system, formation of a CRISPR complex (comprising a guide sequence hybridized to a target sequence and complexed with one or more Cas proteins) results in cleavage of one or both strands in or near (e.g., within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50 or more base pairs) the target sequence. As with the target sequence, it is believed that complete complementarity is not needed, provided this is sufficient to be functional.",

For example, a Cas enzyme, a guide sequence linked to a tracr-mate sequence, and a tracr sequence could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the CRISPR system not included in the first vector. CRISPR system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5\u2032 with respect to (\u201cupstream\u201d of) or 3\u2032 with respect to (\u201cdownstream\u201d of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In certain embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a CRISPR enzyme and one or more of the guide sequence, tracr mate sequence (optionally operably linked to the guide sequence), and a tracr sequence embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g., each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron).",

A CRISPR enzyme fusion protein may comprise any additional protein sequence, and optionally a linker sequence between any two domains. Examples of protein domains that may be fused to a CRISPR enzyme include, without limitation, epitope tags, reporter gene sequences, and protein domains having one or more of the following activities: methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity and nucleic acid binding activity. Additional domains that may form part of a fusion protein comprising a CRISPR enzyme are described in U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. No. US20110059502, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Such methods can be used to administer nucleic acids encoding components of a CRISPR system to cells in culture, or in a host organism. Non-viral vector delivery systems include DNA plasmids, RNA (e.g., a transcript of a vector described herein), naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle, such as a liposome. Viral vector delivery systems include DNA and RNA viruses, which have either episomal or integrated genomes after delivery to the cell (Anderson, 1992, Science 256:808-813; and Yu, et al., 1994, Gene Therapy 1:13-26).",

Cas proteins can also comprise nuclease domains (i.e., DNase or RNase domains), DNA binding domains, helicase domains, RNAse domains, protein-protein interaction domains, dimerization domains, as well as other domains. The Cas proteins can be modified to increase nucleic acid binding affinity and/or specificity, alter an enzymatic activity, and/or change another property of the protein. In certain embodiments, the Cas-like protein of the fusion protein can be derived from a wild type Cas9 protein or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the Cas can be derived from modified Cas9 protein. For example, the amino acid sequence of the Cas9 protein can be modified to alter one or more properties (e.g., nuclease activity, affinity, stability, and so forth) of the protein. Alternatively, domains of the Cas9 protein not involved in RNA-guided cleavage can be eliminated from the protein such that the modified Cas9 protein is smaller than the wild type Cas9 protein. In general, a Cas9 protein comprises at least two nuclease (i.e., DNase) domains. For example, a Cas9 protein can comprise a RuvC-like nuclease domain and a HNH-like nuclease domain. The RuvC and HNH domains work together to cut single strands to make a double-stranded break in DNA. (Jinek, et al., 2012, Science, 337:816-821). In certain embodiments, the Cas9-derived protein can be modified to contain only one functional nuclease domain (either a RuvC-like or a HNH-like nuclease domain). For example, the Cas9-derived protein can be modified such that one of the nuclease domains is deleted or mutated such that it is no longer functional (i.e., the nuclease activity is absent). In some embodiments in which one of the nuclease domains is inactive, the Cas9-derived protein is able to introduce a nick into a double-stranded nucleic acid (such protein is termed a \u201cnickase\u201d), but not cleave the double-stranded DNA. In any of the above-described embodiments, any or all of the nuclease domains can be inactivated by one or more deletion mutations, insertion mutations, and/or substitution mutations using well-known methods, such as site-directed mutagenesis, PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and total gene synthesis, as well as other methods known in the art.",

Prior to in vitro transcription, the circular plasmid is linearized downstream of the polyadenyl cassette by type II restriction enzymes (recognition sequence corresponds to cleavage site). The polyadenyl cassette thus corresponds to the later poly(A) sequence in the transcript. As a result of this procedure, some nucleotides remain as part of the enzyme cleavage site after linearization and extend or mask the poly(A) sequence at the 3\u2032 end.

Gene expression from an RNA source does not require transcription and the protein product is produced rapidly after the transfection. Further, since the RNA has to only gain access to the cytoplasm, rather than the nucleus, and therefore typical transfection methods result in an extremely high rate of transfection. In addition, plasmid based approaches require that the promoter driving the expression of the gene of interest be active in the cells under study.",

Preferably, the subject is a human. Cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, spleen tissue, umbilical cord, cancer cells and tumors. In certain embodiments, any number of cell lines available in the art, may be used. In certain embodiments, cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll separation. In one embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis or leukapheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations, for subsequent processing steps. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca-free, Mg-free PBS. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media.",
                                "In another embodiment, cells are isolated from peripheral blood. Alternatively, cells can be isolated from umbilical cord. In any event, a specific subpopulation of cells can be further isolated by positive or negative selection techniques.",
                                "Cells can also be frozen. While many freezing solutions and parameters are known in the art and will be useful in this context, in a non-limiting example, one method involves using PBS containing 20% DMSO and 8% human serum albumin, or other suitable cell freezing media. The cells are then frozen to \u221280\u00b0 C. at a rate of 1\u00b0 per minute and stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage tank. Other methods of controlled freezing may be used as well as uncontrolled freezing immediately at \u221220\u00b0 C. or in liquid nitrogen."

The repression plasmid dgRNA-Com:CK comprises a U6 promoter, a Com gRNA scaffold, a CMV promoter and a COM-KRAB complex (SEQ ID NO:2). All key DNA fragments in these plasmids were synthesized by GENEWIZ or IDT, then cloned into pUC57, or lentiviral plasmids using general molecular cloning and Gibson assembly (NEB). dgRNAs (14-nt or 15-nt) were designed to target the first 200 bp upstream of each TSS (Table 1, SEQ ID NOs. 3-28). Five dgRNAs were designed to target each gene. TRE-MPH (SEQ ID NO: 29) and TRE-CK (SEQ ID NO: 30) were constructed based on dgRNA-MS2:MPH and dgRNA-Com:CK by inserting CMV-rtTA cassette and replacing the CMV promoter, which drives MPH or CK expression, with a TRE3G inducible promoter. For establishment of TRE-MPH, TRE-CK, and TRE-MPH-CK cell lines, HEK293 cells were transduced with Cas9-expressing lentivirus to establish a constitutive Cas9 expression cell line, then transfected with TRE-MPH and/or TRE-CK plasmids followed by G418 selection and PCR identification.",

T. et al. (2011) Nature Methods 8, 671-U102, doi:10.1038/Nmeth. 1648). The expression cassette of Venus-T2A-mCherry was cloned in between the CMV promoter and SV40 poly (A) signal. The CRISPR targeting site was designed at the bf-Venus disrupted region. As Cas9 specifically induces DSBs, if DSBs are repaired by the NHEJ pathway, approximately 1/3 of the repaired events would generate in-frame functional mCherry. Alternatively, if DSBs are repaired by the EGFP HDR donor to generate intact Venus, the disrupted region of bf-Venus would be corrected leaving fs-mCherry remaining out of frame.",

                                "To enhance HDR efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene editing with clean genetic approaches that avoid the potential side effects from chemical compounds, a method was developed that tunes the expression of DNA damage repair pathway components by dgRNA/active Cas9 mediated CRISPRa and CRISPRi (CRISPRa/i). A Com binding loop was constructed into a dgRNA scaffold for recruiting the Com-KRAB (CK) fusion domain to repress NHEJ-related genes (FIG. 1B). MS2 binding loops were introduced into a into a dgRNA scaffold for recruiting a MCP-P65-HSF1 (MPH) fusion domain to activate HDR-related genes (FIG. 1A). These two constructs were first tested using an EGFP reporter system, and then two endogenous genes. The results showed robust activation and repression of both exogenous reporter genes and endogenous genes, where the EGFP's mRNA level was significantly upregulated by dgGFP-MS2:MPH and repressed by dgGFP-Com:CK (FIG. 5A-5C). The transcriptional level of ASCL1 and HBG1 were dramatically upregulated by dgRNA-MS2:MPH systems with gene-specific dgRNAs (FIG. 5D-5E). Based on the robust functions of dgRNA-MS2:MPH and dgRNA-Com:CK, the activation and repression of several key HDR and NHEJ genes, respectively, were programmed. The results showed that transcript levels of CDK1, which promotes efficient end resection by phosphorylating DSB resection nuclease and CtIP, an enzyme that promotes resection of DNA ends to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is essential for HR, were upregulated by nearly 3-fold (FIGS. 5F-5G). LIG4, KU70 and KU80 transcript levels were reduced by 40-50% (FIGS. 5H-5J).",
                                "Next, it was determined whether CDK1 and CtIP activation or LIG4, KU70 and KU80 inhibition could enhance HDR frequency for CRISPR-mediated precise gene editing. To quantitatively determine the HDR and NHEJ outcome, a Traffic Light Reporter (TLR) stable expression HEK293 cell line that also expresses Cas9 (HEK293-Cas9-TLR) was generated (FIG. 1C). The TLR included a nonfunctional green fluorescent reporter in which codons 53-63 were disrupted (broken frame Venus, bf-Venus), driven by a CMV promoter. In addition, a self-cleaving peptide T2A and a red fluorescent reporter with a 2 bp frameshift (fs-mCherry) were cloned closely adjacent to the bf-Venus (FIG. 1C). With an sgRNA targeting the 5\u2032 region of the bf-Venus, Cas9 induces DSBs, which can subsequently be repaired by two major DNA repair pathways, NHEJ or HDR. NHEJ causes indels shifting the coding frame of the T2A-mCherry. Approximately \u2153 of the mutagenic NHEJ events generated in-frame functional mCherry that could be detected in cells (FIG. 6B). However, if an intact EGFP HDR donor was provided during DSB repair, the bf-Venus would be corrected in a precise manner that leaves the succeeding fs-mCherry out of frame (FIG. 6C). Thus, this TRL reporter allowed accurate quantification of HDR and NHEJ events.",
                                "Using this TLR reporter, the HEK293-Cas9-TLR cell line was transfected with dgRNA-Com:CK and/or dgRNA-MS2:MPH plasmids targeting CDK1, CtIP, LIG4, KU70 and KU80 to modulate the expression of these factors. Twenty-four hours later, cells were co-transfected with PCR EGFP HDR template and sgVenus-ECFP expression plasmid (SEQ ID NO: 35) (FIG. 7A). ECFP+ cells were gated by FACS after 48 h of transfection (FIG. 7B), and the frequency of EGFP+ and mCherry+ cells were determined (FIG. 7C). In the vector group, 2.42% EGFP+ and 6.82% mCherry+ cells were observed, which represented HDR- and NHEJ-positive events, respectively (FIG. 7C). In contrast, the percentage of EGFP+ cells was dramatically increased after activating HDR related genes by dgRNA-MS2:MPH, or repressing NHEJ related genes by dgRNA-Com:CK, for most genes or combinations tested (FIG. 1D; FIG. 7C). Particularly, in the group of dgCDK1-2:MS2-MPH (dgCDK1-2)+dgKU80-1:Com-CK (dgKU80-1), 15.4% EGFP-positive cells were observed (FIG. 1D; FIG. 7C). To confirm that the DSBs were repaired through HDR or NHEJ pathways, EGFP+/mCherry\u2212, EGFP\u2212/mCherry+ and EGFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212 cells were cloned and the TLR sgRNA targeting sites were sequenced. It was observed that in EGFP+/mCherry\u2212 clones, the bf-Venus gene was precisely repaired by the EGFP HDR donor without indels, whereas various indels were found in both EGFP\u2212/mCherry+ and EGFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212 clones (FIGS. 8A-8C), confirming the HDR and NHEJ events at the genomic DNA (gDNA) level. Thus, with the robust TLR system, modulating HDR factors, NHEJ factors, or their combinations significantly enhanced HDR efficiency, where both programming HDR/NHEJ by CRISPRa/i and Cas9-mediated gene editing were achieved simultaneously with a single Cas9 transgene.",
                                "The dgCDK1-2+dgKU80-1 combination had the highest enhancement of HDR efficiency among all tested groups/programs as revealed by the TLR experiment. The effect of this system on CRISPR-mediated gene editing was tested on an endogenous genomic locus by measuring the precise integration of an HDR donor expression cassette, SA-T2A-EGFP (SEQ ID NO: 37; AAVS-SA-T2A-EGFP-AAVS-PcDNA3.1), into the first intron of the canonical AAVS1 locus upon Cas9/sgRNA induced double stranded break (FIG. 1E). The SA-T2A-GFP was flanked by an AAVS1 left homology arm (489 bp) and a right homology arm (855 bp), where EGFP could only be expressed when the SA-T2A-EGFP was precisely recombined into the target site (FIG. 1E). dgRNA-Com:CK and/or dgRNA-MS2:MPH constructs targeting CDK1 and KU80 genes were transfected into the HEK293-Cas9 cell line. Twenty-four hours later, these cells were co-transfected with SA-T2A-EGFP HDR donor template and an sgAAVS1-mCherry plasmid (SEQ ID NO: 65) and then analyzed by FACS 48 h after transfection. Compared to the baseline 2.09% GFP+ cells in the mCherry+ population in the vector group, the fraction of GFP+ cells from dgCDK1-2, dgKU80-1 and dgCDK1-2+dgKU80-1 groups were significantly increased to 7.58%, 6.64% and 15.3%, respectively (FIGS. 1G-1H). Quantitative results showed that HDR efficiency was enhanced over 3 fold with single factor programming and over 7 fold with dual programming on the endogenous AAVS1 locus (FIGS. 1G-1H). Results were confirmed with two additional cell lines, with up to 5 fold HDR enhancement in HEK293T cells and 5 fold in HeLa cells (FIGS. 1I-1L). Another sgRNA was designed for AAVS1 targeting using the same HDR template (FIG. 2A)(SEQ ID NO: 34). The results showed that HDR can also be significantly improved using this sgRNA (FIGS. 2B-2C). In addition, another gene locus, ACTB, was tested. Activation of CDK1 and repression of KU80 significantly enhanced HDR up to 4-5 fold (FIGS. 2D-2F). Results from all cell lines and loci showed that HDR efficiency enhancement was most dramatic in the dgCDK1-2+dgKU80-1 combination group. The endogenous AAVS1 locus was amplified, cloned, and sequenced, confirming the precise integration of SA-T2A-EGFP into the anticipated target site (FIG. 1F, FIG. 8D). Thus, in concordance with the exogenous TLR results, an enhanced efficacy of precise gene targeting via HDR in the native mammalian genome was demonstrated.",
                                "To further improve the programmability, the approach was adapted to additional conditional-expression modules and viral packaging systems. To reduce potential side effects from constitutive activation of CDK1 or deficiency of KU80, a Tet-On system inducible by doxycycline (Dox) was utilized to control the expression of CRISPRa and CRISPRi effectors, MPH and CK, respectively. Two vectors, TRE-MPH and TRE-CK, were constructed (FIG. 3A). Both vectors contain a CMV-rtTA expression cassette. When cells are treated with Dox, the rtTA protein specifically binds to the TRE3G promoter and thereby initiates the transcription of MPH or CK downstream (FIG. 3A), which is reversibly turned off upon Dox removal. These plasmids were transfected into HEK293-Cas9 individually and in combination. G418 selection and cell cloning followed to obtain TRE-MPH, TRE-CK, and TRE-MPH-CK cell lines (FIG. 3B). By qRT-PCR, it was determined that CDK1 and KU80 were significantly activated or repressed, respectively, in a select set of stable cell lines (FIG. 3C-3D). TRE-MPH-2 and TRE-CK-4 were chosen based on their best potency of Dox-induced CDK1 activation and KU80 repression for the subsequent endogenous HDR experiments.",
                                "Three different cell lines were treated with Dox for 24 h, then the SA-T2A-EGFP HDR donor for AAVS1 locus and sgAAVS1-mCherry plasmid were co-transfected. After 48 h of transfection, EGFP+ cells in mCherry+ population were quantified by FACS. Upon Dox treatment, the percentages of EGFP+ cells significantly increased in all three groups as compared to control (FIG. 9A), and without any side effects for Dox (FIG. 9B). Albeit, a similar 4-fold enhancement was observed, possibly due to the capacity of Dox-inducible gene expression. Although the transcriptional levels of CDK1 activation or KU80 repression can vary between clones, the clones with significant CDK1 activation and/or KU80 repression showed increased HDR efficiency. These data demonstrate that the CRISPRa/i DNA repair programming can be used in conjunction with an inducible expression system to allow further control of HDR enhancement.",
                                "Usage of a lentiviral system was adopted for stable integration of constructs for CRISPRa of DNA repair factors (FIG. 4A). Lentivirus-integrated cell lines expressing dgCDK1-MS2:MPH were generated (SEQ ID NO: 38), and the endogenous AAVS1 targeting experiment was repeated with introduction of an HDR donor and sgAAVS1-Puro by transfection (FIG. 4B). Consistent with previous results herein, FACS analysis again showed significant enhancement of HDR efficiency (FIG. 4C), indicating the adaptability of this DNA repair programming mediated HDR enhancement system to viral delivery vehicles.",
                                "In conclusion, the data together showed that CRISPRa/i mediated activation and inhibition of key genes related to DNA damage repair pathways is an effective way to increase the efficiency of HDR for precise genome editing in mammalian cells. With the activation of CDK1 by dgRNA-MS2:MPH and/or repression of KU80 by dgRNA-Com:CK, the HDR efficiency can be enhanced by 4-8 fold. In this system, through combinatorial usage of sgRNA and dgRNA for different purposes, genome editing, gene activation and repression were achieved simultaneously simply with a single Cas9 transgene (FIG. 4D).",
                                "The approach described herein is versatile and flexible, with active-Cas9-dgRNA mediating CRISPRa/i programming of DNA repair machinery, where the active Cas9 can still perform its function of generating DSB for HDR-mediated precise gene editing. These components can join force with an armamentarium of other genetic tools such as inducible gene expression modules via simple genetic engineering. Furthermore, the CRISPRa/i constructs can be packaged into viral vectors for efficient delivery into a large repertoire of cell types. For in vivo manipulation, the construction size of CRISPRa/i is slightly larger than traditional approaches used for Cas9-based HDR. Two AAV systems can be used for simultaneous delivery of activation or/and repression components and HDR donor template. Finally, this is a genetic approach of HDR enhancement, and thus can be easily adapted for in vivo settings in time- and tissue-specific manner, which is essential for the application of gene therapy."
