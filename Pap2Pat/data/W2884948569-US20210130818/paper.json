    "abstract": "CRISPR systems have been proven as versatile tools for site-specific genome engineering in mammalian species. During the gene editing processes, these RNA-guide nucleases introduce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), in which non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) dominates the DNA repair pathway, limiting the efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR), the alternative pathway essential for precise gene targeting. Multiple approaches have been developed to enhance HDR, including chemical compound or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of NHEJ factors, small molecule activation of HDR enzymes, or cell cycle timed delivery of CRISPR complex. However, these approaches face multiple challenges, yet have moderate or variable effects. Here we developed a new approach that programs both NHEJ and HDR pathways with CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) to achieve significantly enhanced HDR efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene editing. The manipulation of NHEJ and HDR pathway components, such as CtIP, CDK1, KU70, KU80, and LIG4, was mediated by catalytically dead guide RNAs (dgRNAs), thus relying on only a single catalytically active Cas9 to perform both CRISPRa/i and precise gene editing. While reprogramming of most DNA repair factors or their combinations tested enhanced HDR efficiency, simultaneously activating CDK1 and repressing KU80 has the strongest effect with increased HDR rate upto an order of magnitude. Doxycycline-induced dgRNA-based CRISPRa/i programming of DNA repair enzymes, as well as viral packaging enabled flexible and tunable HDR enhancement for broader applicability in mammalian cells. Our study provides an effective, flexible, and potentially safer strategy to enhance precise genome modifications, which might broadly impact human gene editing and therapy.",

                "Organisms evolved multiple mechanisms to maintain genome integrity1,2. As the cellular genome is constantly exposed to environmental damage, multiple DNA damage repair pathways exist to protect the genome from harmful or potentially catastrophic alterations3. DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways are highly conserved between eukaryotes including mammalian species4,5. Non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair\u00a0(HDR) are two major DNA repair pathways that can either act in concert or antagonistic manner6. HDR is a pathway which uses template DNA, such as an intact sister chromosomal copy or an exogenous donor to repair the DSBs7, thus can robustly generate perfect repair8. However, HDR efficiency depends on species, cell type, and the stage of the cell cycles8\u201312. In mammalian cells, NHEJ has been considered the major pathway to repair the DNA13, whereas HDR is more common in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae14. NHEJ is an imperfect process, which often lead to gain or loss of a few nucleotides at each end of the breakage site13,15. This character can lead to subsequent deleterious genetic alteration that results in cellular malfunctioning, cancer, or aging16. The DNA repair enzymes KU70, KU80, and Ligase IV (LIG4) play central roles in NHEJ-mediated DNA repair, where KU70 and KU80 proteins stabilize the DNA ends and make them physical proximity to facilitate end ligation performed by LIG47. On the other hand, proteins such as BRCA1/2, RAD50, RAD51, and various cell cycle regulators are directly involved in homology-directed repair (HDR)9,17, although the pathway has yet to be fully characterized.",
                "The type II bacterial adaptive immune system, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) is a powerful genome editing tool18\u201320. The Cas9\u00a0-\u00a0single guide RNA (sgRNA) complex induces site-specific DSBs, which can be repaired by either of the two main DNA repair pathways, NHEJ and HDR. The error-prone repairs by NHEJ often introduce unpredictable frame shift insertions and deletions (indels), leading to loss-of-function of target genes. In contrast, HDR can either generate perfect DNA repair or precise genome modification guided by donor templates. However, HDR is substantially less efficient compared to NHEJ21,22 in mammalian cells and most often restricted to S/G2 phase(s) of the cell cycle23. Owning to the importance of HDR in mediating precise genetic modification, extensive efforts have been made to change the balance of DNA repair pathways. However, due to the intricacy of the DNA repair pathways, the available tools to enhance HDR are still limited to a few choices with relatively small effect. Moreover, little success to date has been achieved to directly augment the HDR pathway itself. Thus, manipulation of both HDR and NHEJ using simple genetic tools might enable or strengthen a variety of genome editing applications. Recently, 14-nt or 15-nt guide RNAs have been shown to be catalytically inactive yet maintain the target-site binding capacity24,25. These catalytically dead guide RNAs (dgRNAs) thus can be utilized to modulate gene expression using a catalytically active Cas924,25. Therefore, an active Cas9 nuclease can be repurposed to simultaneously perform genome editing and regulate gene transcription using both types of gRNAs in the same cell. We thus hypothesize that dgRNAs together with the associated CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) modules can be deployed to achieve HDR enhancement using a single active Cas9."

                "To enhance HDR efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene editing with clean genetic approaches that avoid the potential side effects from chemical compounds, we leverage a method that tunes the expression of DNA damage repair pathway components by dgRNA/active Cas9-mediated CRISPRa and CRISPRi (CRISPRa/i). We constructed Com binding loop into dgRNA scaffold26 for recruiting COM-KRAB (CK) fusion domain to repress the NHEJ-related genes, as well as MS2-binding loops into dgRNA scaffold26,27 for recruiting MCP\u00a0-\u00a0P65-HSF1 (MPH) fusion domain to activate HDR-related genes (Fig.\u00a01a, b). With these two constructs we first tested them using an EGFP reporter system, and then two endogenous genes. The results showed robust activation and repression of both exogenous reporter genes and endogenous genes, where the EGFP\u2019s mRNA level was significantly upregulated by dgGFP\u00a0-\u00a0MS2:MPH and repressed by dgGFP-Com:CK (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1a\u2013c), and the transcriptional level of ASCL1 and HBG1 were dramatically upregulated by dgRNA-MS2:MPH systems with gene-specific dgRNAs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1d, e). Based on the robust functions of dgRNA-MS2:MPH and dgRNA-Com:CK, we programmed the activation and repression of several key HDR and NHEJ genes, respectively. The results showed that CDK1, promotes efficient end resection by phosphorylating DSB resection nuclease28, and CtIP, is well-known enzyme promoting resection of DNA ends to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which is essential for HR29, transcript levels were upregulated by near three-fold, and LIG4, KU70, and KU80 were reduced by 40\u201350% (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1f\u2013j).Fig. 1Programming key genes of HDR and NHEJ pathways enhanced HDR efficiency.a Diagram of dgRNA-MS2:MPH expression vector for activating key genes of HDR pathway. b Diagram of dgRNA-Com:CK expression vector for repressing key genes of NHEJ pathway. c Diagram of the TLR system. Cas9/sgRNA can induce DSBs in the target site. If DSBs are repaired by NHEJ, 3n\u2009+\u20092\u2009bp frame shift indels can restore mCherry expression, which accounted for approximately 1/3 mutagenic NHEJ events. Alternatively, if DSBs were repaired according an intact EGFP template, the mutations in bf-Venus will be corrected, leading to Venus (EGFP variant) expression. d Quantitative results of HDR efficiency by programming essential components of DNA repair pathways (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0014; Vector vs. dgCtIP-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0079; Vector vs. dgLIG4-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0031; Vector vs. dgKU70-2, p\u2009=\u20090.026; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0338; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgCtIP-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0138; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgLIG4-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0022; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU70-2, p\u2009=\u20090.075; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0493; Vector vs. dgCtIP-1\u2009+\u2009dgLIG4-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0692; Vector vs. dgCtIP-1\u2009+\u2009dgKU70-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0245; Vector vs. dgCtIP-1\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0063; Vector vs. dgLIG4-1\u2009+\u2009dgKU70-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0337; Vector vs. dgLIG4-1\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0606; Vector vs. dgKU70-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0299), the representative flow cytometry figures are shown in Fig.\u00a0S3c. e Strategy for insertion of an EGFP reporter gene into the human AAVS1 locus using CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. The SA-T2A-EGFP promoterless cassette was flanked by two AAVS1 homology arms, left arm (489\u2009bp) and right arm (855\u2009bp). SA, splice acceptor, T2A, a self-cleaving peptide, PA, a short polyA signal, primer F and primer R were designed for EGFP-positive events identification and sequencing. f Chromatogram and sequences of HDR-positive events. Partial donor sequences and adjacent genomic DNA sequence were represented. g\u2013l HDR efficiency was determined in three different cell lines, HEK293 (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0153; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0404; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.029), HEK293T (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0008; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0227; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0087) and HeLa (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.015; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0216; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0004). CDK1 activation and/or KU80 repression significantly increased HDR efficiency. These cell lines were co-transfected with SA-T2A-EGFP donor and sgAAVS1-mCherry expression vectors 24\u2009h after dgRNA-Com:CK and/or dgRNA-MS2:MPH transfection. At day 3, the frequency of EGFP+ cells within mCherry+ population were determined using FACS. Data are showed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM from three independent experiments. Significance was calculated using the Paired t-test. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001",
                "We next sought to determine if CDK1 and CtIP activation or LIG4, KU70, and KU80 inhibition could enhance HDR frequency for CRISPR-mediated precise gene editing. To quantitatively determine the HDR and NHEJ outcome, we firstly generated a traffic light reporter (TLR)30 stable expression HEK293 cell line that also expresses Cas9 (HEK293-Cas9-TLR) (Fig.\u00a01c). The TLR includes a nonfunctional green fluorescent reporter in which codons 53\u201363 were disrupted (broken frame Venus, bf-Venus), driven by a CMV promoter. In addition, a self-cleaving peptide T2A and a red fluorescent reporter with a 2\u2009bp frameshift (fs-mCherry) were cloned closely adjacent to the bf-Venus (Fig.\u00a01c). With an sgRNA targeting the 5\u2032 region of the bf-Venus, Cas9 induces DSBs, which can subsequently be repaired by two major DNA repair pathways, NHEJ or HDR. NHEJ caused indels shifting the coding frame of the T2A-mCherry, where \u223c1/3 of the mutagenic NHEJ events generate in-frame functional mCherry that could be detected in cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2b). However, if an intact EGFP HDR donor was provided during DSB repair, the bf-Venus could be corrected in a precise manner that leaves the succeeding fs-mCherry remaining out of frame (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2c). Thus, this TRL reporter allows us to accurately quantify HDR and NHEJ events.",
                "Using this TLR reporter, we transfected HEK293-Cas9-TLR cell line with dgRNA-Com:CK and/or dgRNA-MS2:MPH plasmids targeting CDK1, CtIP, LIG4, KU70, and KU80 to modulate the expression of these factors. 24\u2009h later, cells were co-transfected with PCR EGFP HDR template and sgVenus-ECFP expression plasmids (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3a). ECFP+ cells were gated by FACS after 48\u2009h of transfection (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3b), and the frequency of EGFP+ and mCherry+ cells were determined (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3c). In the vector group, we observed 2.42% EGFP+ and 6.82% mCherry+ cells, which represented HDR-positive and NHEJ-positive events, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3c). In contrast, the percentage of EGFP+ cells was dramatically increased after activating HDR-related genes by dgRNA-MS2:MPH, or repressing NHEJ-related genes by dgRNA-Com:CK, for all 15 single or combinatorial perturbations tested, with 12/15 perturbations reaching statistical significance (Fig.\u00a01d; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3c). Particularly, in the group of dgCDK1\u00a0-\u00a02:MS2-MPH (dgCDK1\u20132)\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1:Com-CK (dgKU80-1), 15.4% EGFP-positive cells were observed (Fig.\u00a01d; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3c). Of note, NHEJ has two major sub-classes of pathways, classical NHEJ (C-NHEJ) and micro-homology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), also known as alternative end joining (Alt-EJ), which uses of 5\u201325\u2009bp microhomologous sequences during broken ends alignment before the ends join, thus resulting in indels flanking the original break31,32. C-NHEJ is not error prone, whereas MMEJ is. Both pathways are distinct from HDR. Our assay measures the outcome of mutation acquisition, thus it measures non-classical NHEJ (MMEJ) but not C-NHEJ, where most of the repairs are not mutagenic thus is silent from the assay. Interestingly, KU70 and KU-80 repression by dgRNA showed that KU-silencing only increase template-dependent precise gene editing (HDR, as measured by Venus), but does not increase mutagenic repair (NHEJ/MMEJ, as measured by mCherry) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3c). Thus, suppression of KU70/KU80 may tip the balance of NHEJ (C-NHEJ and MMEJ) and HDR pathways, thereby increases the HDR efficiency. To confirm that the DSBs were repaired through HDR or NHEJ pathways, EGFP+/mCherry\u2212, EGFP\u2212/mCherry+ and EGFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212 cells were cloned and the TLR sgRNA-targeting sites were sequenced. It was observed that in EGFP+/mCherry\u2212 clones, the bf-Venus gene was precisely repaired by the EGFP HDR donor without indels, whereas various indels were found in both EGFP\u2212/mCherry+ and EGFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212 clones (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4a\u2013c), together confirming the HDR and NHEJ events at genomic DNA (gDNA) level. Thus, with the robust TLR system, we found that modulating HDR factors, NHEJ factors, or their combinations can significantly enhance HDR efficiency, where both programming HDR/NHEJ by CRISPRa/i and Cas9-mediated gene editing were achieved simultaneously with a single Cas9 transgene.",
                "The dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1 combination has the highest enhancement of HDR efficiency as revealed by TLR experiment among all tested groups/programs. To test its effect on CRISPR-mediated gene editing at an endogenous genomic locus, we measured the precise integration of an HDR donor SA-T2A-EGFP expression cassette into the first intron of the canonical AAVS1 locus upon Cas9/sgRNA-induced DSB (Fig.\u00a01e). The SA-T2A-GFP was flanked by an AAVS1 left homology arm (489\u2009bp) and a right homology arm (855\u2009bp), where EGFP could only be expressed when the SA-T2A-EGFP was precisely recombined into the target site (Fig.\u00a01e). We firstly transfected dgRNA-Com:CK and/or dgRNA-MS2:MPH constructs targeting CDK1 and KU80 genes using the HEK293-Cas9 cell line. 24\u2009h later, these cells were co-transfected with SA-T2A-EGFP HDR donor template and an sgAAVS1-mCherry plasmid and then analyzed by FACS 48\u2009h after transfection. Compared to the baseline 2.09% GFP+ cells in the mCherry+ population in vector group, the fraction of GFP+ cells from dgCDK1-2, dgKU80-1, and dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1 groups were significantly increased to 7.58%, 6.64%, and 15.3%, respectively (Fig.\u00a01g, h). Quantitative result showed that HDR efficiency was enhanced over three-fold with single factor programming and over seven-fold with dual programming on an endogenous locus AAVS1 (Fig.\u00a01g, h). We confirmed the results with two additional cell lines, with upto five-fold HDR enhancement in HEK293T and again five-fold in HeLa (Fig.\u00a01i\u2013l). We also designed another sgRNA for AAVS1 targeting using a same HDR template (Fig.\u00a02a), the result showed that HDR also can be significantly improved (Fig.\u00a02b, c). In addition, we tested another gene locus, ACTB, activation of CDK1 and repression of KU80 significantly enhanced HDR upto 4\u20135-fold (Fig.\u00a02d-f). Results from all those cell lines and loci showed that HDR efficiency enhancement was most dramatic in the dgCDK1\u20132\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1 combination group. We amplified, cloned, and sequenced the endogenous AAVS1 locus and confirmed the precise integration of SA-T2A-EGFP into the anticipated target site (Fig.\u00a01f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4d). Thus, in concordance with the exogenous TLR results, we observed an enhanced efficacy of precise gene targeting via HDR in the native mammalian genome.Fig. 2Activate CDK1 and repress KU80 could enhance HDR efficiency in endogenous loci.a A scheme of insertion strategy at the human AAVS1 locus. A new AAVS1 targeting site was designed, sgAAVS1\u20132 was close to sgAAVS1-1 targeting site, but both used a same HDR donor template. b-c HDR efficiency at the different AAVS1 locus (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.0443; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0699; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0044). d A scheme of insertion strategy at the human ACTB locus. e-f Flow cytometry showed that the HDR efficiency was significantly improved after activating CDK1 and repressing KU80 genes (Vector vs. dgCDK1-2, p\u2009=\u20090.1166; Vector vs. dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0504; Vector vs. dgCDK1-2\u2009+\u2009dgKU80-1, p\u2009=\u20090.0156). Significance was calculated using the Unpaired t-test. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01",
                "To further improve the programmability of this approach, we adapted it to additional conditional-expression modules and viral packaging system. To reduce potential side effects from constitutive activation of CDK1 or deficiency of KU80, we utilized a Tet-On system inducible by doxycycline (Dox) to control the expression of CRISPRa and CRISPRi effectors, MPH and CK, respectively. We constructed two vectors, TRE-MPH and TRE-CK (Fig.\u00a03a). Both vectors contain a CMV-rtTA expression cassette, when cells are treated with Dox, the rtTA protein will specifically bind to TRE3G promoter and thereby initiate the transcription of MPH or CK downstream (Fig.\u00a03a), which will be reversibly turned off upon Dox removal. We transfected these plasmids into HEK293-Cas9 individually and in combination, then followed by G418 selection and cell cloning to obtain TRE-MPH, TRE-CK, and TRE-MPH-CK cell lines (Fig.\u00a03b). By qRT-PCR, we determined that CDK1 and KU80 will be significantly activated or repressed, respectively, in a select set of stable cell lines (Fig.\u00a03c, d). We chose TRE-MPH-2 and TRE-CK-4 based on their best potency of Dox-induced CDK1 activation and KU80 repression for the subsequent endogenous HDR experiment. Three different cell lines were treated with Dox for 24\u2009h, then the SA-T2A-EGFP HDR donor for AAVS1 locus and sgAAVS1-mCherry plasmid were co-transfected. After 48\u2009h of transfection, EGFP+ cells in mCherry+ population were quantified by FACS, which revealed that upon Dox treatment, the percentages of EGFP+ cells significantly increased in all three groups as compared to control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5a), and without any side effects for Dox (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5b), albeit interesting with a similar four-fold enhancement possibly due to the capacity of Dox-inducible gene expression. Of note, although the transcriptional levels of CDK1 activation or KU80 repression can vary between clones, the clones with significant CDK1 activation and/or KU80 repression have increased HDR efficiency. This data suggests that the CRISPRa/i DNA repair programming can be used in conjunction of inducible expression system to allow further control of HDR enhancement.Fig. 3An inducible DNA repair CRISPRa/i system for enhancing HDR efficiency.a Diagram of TRE-MPH and TRE-CK expression vectors used to activate CDK1 and repress KU80, respectively. rtTA interact with doxycycline, the complex could bind to TRE3G promoter, which then initiate the transcription of MCP-P65-HSF1 or COM-KRAB. b The workflow of establishing inducible HDR increasing system. Activation of CDK1 and/or repression of KU80 can be achieved by simply controlling the availability of doxycycline. Dox, doxycycline; Puro, puromycin. c-e HEK293-TRE-MPH, HEK293-TRE-CK, and HEK293-TRE-MPH-CK cell lines were obtained based on HEK293-Cas9 cell line by G418 selection. Several random clones were picked for each cell line. Although the transcriptional levels of CDK1 activation or KU80 repression can vary between clones, the clones with significant CDK1 activation and/or KU80 repression have increased HDR efficiency. The transcription level of CDK1 and KU80 were determined by RT-qPCR after 2 days of doxycycline treatment. f Quantitative analysis result of HDR efficiency (HEK293-TRE-MPH vs. HEK293-TRE-MPH\u2009+\u2009Dox, p\u2009=\u20090.001; HEK293-TRE-CK vs. HEK293-TRE-CK\u2009+\u2009Dox, p\u2009=\u20090.0011; HEK293-TRE-MPH-CK vs. HEK293-TRE-MPH-CK\u2009+\u2009Dox, p\u2009=\u20090.0032). Data was shown as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM from three independent experiments. Significance was calculated using the Paired t-test. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ****p\u2009<\u20090.0001",
                "Finally, we adopt the usage of lentiviral system for stable integration of constructs for CRISPRa of DNA repair factors (Fig.\u00a04a). We generated lentivirus-integrated cell lines expressing dgCDK1-MS2:MPH, and repeated the endogenous AAVS1 targeting experiment with introduction of HDR donor and sgAAVS1-Puro by transfection (Fig.\u00a04b). Consistent with results above, FACS analysis again showed significant enhancement of HDR efficiency (Fig.\u00a04c), indicating the adaptability of this DNA repair programming-mediated HDR enhancement system to viral delivery vehicles. In conclusion, our data together showed that CRISPRa/i-mediated activation and inhibition of key genes related to DNA damage repair pathways is an effective way to increase the efficiency of HDR for precise genome editing in mammalian cells. With the activation of CDK1 by dgRNA-MS2:MPH and/or repression of KU80 by dgRNA-Com:CK, the HDR efficiency can be enhanced by 4\u20138 fold. In this system, through combinatorial usage of sgRNA and dgRNA for different purposes, we achieved the genome editing, gene activation, and repression simultaneously simply with a single Cas9 transgene (Fig.\u00a04d).Fig. 4Packaging the DNA repair CRISPRa/i system with lentivirus for enhancement of HDR efficiency with viral delivery.a The CDK1 activation plasmid was reconstructed into lentivirus backbone.

Then the HEK239FT-Cas9 cell-line was transduced with dgCDK1-MS2:MPH lentivirus, followed by 2-3 days hygromycin selection. Finally, cells were transfected with sgAAVS1-Puro plasmid and SA-T2A-EGFP HR donor. The flow cytometry analysis was performed after 2 days' puromycin selection. Blast, blasticidin; Puro, puromycin. c The flow cytometry results demonstrated that HDR efficiency was significantly increased as compared with the vector group. d Schematic diagram representing the central idea of this study: with a single Cas9, through combinatorial usage of sgRNA and dgRNA for gene editing and CRISPRa/i on HDR/NHEJ machinery, HDR efficiency enhancement was achieved."

                "Our approach provides a new way for HDR enhancement compared to other approaches. LIG4 inhibitor SCR7, which was initially defined as an anti-cancer agent33, was used to block the NHEJ pathway and improved the efficiency of Cas9-mediated HDR34,35. High-throughput screening identified two small molecule compounds (L755507 and Brefeldin A) that can enhance CRISPR-mediated HDR frequency by three-fold and two-fold, respectively36. However, these chemicals can have vast side effects or toxicity, and face availability and delivery challenges for in vivo genetic manipulations. SCR7, L755507, and Brefeldin A have insignificant effect on improvement of HDR efficiency at endogenous CTNNB1 and PRDM14 loci in human cells37. SCR7 or L755507 were shown to have minimal effects on HDR improvement of Cas9-mediated or TALEN-mediated knock-in in rabbit, HEK293 or human fibroblast cells38,39, possibly due to different modes of action or different cellular availability of these small molecules across various biological settings. Notably, severe cell death was observed after SCR7 treatment on pluripotent stem cells38. In addition, RS-1, a stimulator of human HDR protein RAD5138,39, and Ad4E1B-E4orf6, which were reported as an inhibitor of NHEJ pathway35, also been used to increase HDR efficiency and achieved a 3\u20136-fold effect. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that these small compounds could decrease HDR in certain settings37. Therefore, small molecular compounds are effective approaches for improving HDR efficiency, while their stability, bioavailability, side effects, toxicity, and modes of action might vary across different settings.",
                "Another strategy to enhance the HDR efficiency is restriction of cell cycle to S and G2 phases. Timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes into cell cycle arrested cells using aphidicolin or nocodazole inhibitors can significantly increase HDR rates in HEK293T cells40. Similar alternative approaches have been used to boost HDR events by fusing a peptide from human Geminin with Cas9, making the fusion protein enriched during S, G2, and M phases but lower in G141,42, because cell-cycle-controlling E3 ubiquitin ligase, APC/Cdh1, is active in the late M and G1, which can ubiquitinate Geminin then leading to their degradation43,44. Cas9-hGem increased the rate of HDR up to 1.87-fold compared to wild-type Cas941. These approaches are challenging to be carried out in vivo, as cell cycles in mammalian organs are delicately controlled in a temporal and spatial manner.",
                "Our approach is versatile and flexible, with active-Cas9-dgRNA mediating CRISPRa/i programming of DNA repair machinery, where the active Cas9 can still perform its function of generating DSB for HDR-mediated precise gene editing. These components can join force with an armamentarium of other genetic tools, such as inducible gene expression modules via simple genetic engineering. Furthermore, the CRISPRa/i constructs can be packaged into viral vectors for efficient delivery into a large repertoire of cell types. For in vivo manipulation, the construction size of CRISPRa/i is slightly larger than that traditionally used for Cas9-based HDR, and two AAV systems45 can be used for simultaneously delivering activation or/and repression components and the HDR donor template. Because DNA damage repair pathways are highly conserved, especially in mammalian species and cell types3,14. It has been demonstrated that CRISPR-mediated HDR and NHEJ occur in various cultured cell types including ES cells19, primary HSC46, and live animals in vivo47,48. Therefore, the dgRNA-based CRISPRa/CRISPRi HDR enhancement system might be worthwhile to be tested in cell types of higher clinical interest, such as ES cells and HSCs. Finally, this is a genetic approach of HDR enhancement thus can be easily adapted for in vivo settings in time-specific and tissue-specific manner, which is essential for the application of gene therapy."

The repression plasmid dgRNA-Com:CK consists of a U6 promoter, a Com gRNA scaffold, a CMV promoter, and a COM-KRAB complex. All key DNA fragments in these plasmids were synthesized by GENEWIZ or IDT, then cloned into pUC57, or lentiviral plasmids using general molecular cloning and Gibson assembly (NEB). dgRNAs (14-nt or 15-nt) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1) were designed to target the first 200\u2009bp upstream of each TSS27. Five dgRNAs were designed to target each gene. TRE-MPH and TRE-CK were constructed based on dgRNA-MS2:MPH and dgRNA-Com:CK by inserting CMV-rtTA cassette and replacing CMV promoter, which drive MPH or CK expression with a TRE3G inducible promoter. For establishment of TRE-MPH, TRE-CK, and TRE-MPH-CK cell lines, we firstly transduced HEK293 cells with Cas9-expressing lentivirus to establish a constitutive Cas9 expression cell line, then transfected with TRE-MPH and/or TRE-CK plasmids followed by G418 selection and PCR identification."

The expression cassette of Venus-T2A-mCherry was cloned in between the CMV promoter and SV40 poly (A) signal. The CRISPR-targeting site was designed at bf-Venus disrupted region.
