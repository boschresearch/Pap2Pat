                        "A user equipment (UE) supporting device-to-device (D2D), in particular vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication can operate in two modes for sidelink radio resource allocation. In a first mode, known as \u201cscheduled resource allocation\u201d, a UE requests transmission radio resources from a base station, and the base station allocates dedicated transmission radio resources to the UE. In a second mode, known as \u201cUE autonomous resource selection\u201d, the UE on its own selects radio resources from preconfigured resource pools. The scheduled resource allocation mode can be, for instance, a 3GPP LTE-A mode 3, and the autonomous resource selection mode can be, for instance, a 3GPP LTE-A mode 4, which are described in 3GPP standard TS 36.213 V15.0.0 (2017 December).",
                        "The situations in which users are out of coverage (OOC) of the cellular network arise in early stages of network deployments or may exist due to obstacles (e.g., a road tunnel or a topology condition creating severe fading) in any stage of network deployments. The OOC situations may occur over space, time, and frequency and may be static or dynamic. Furthermore, the OOC may be expected (known) or unexpected (unknown) and may be limited by the network infrastructure from different sides.",
                        "Out-of-coverage V2V communications are supported by the 3GPP standard LTE-A Release 14 (see 3GPP TS 36.300, 3GPP TS 36.331, 3GPP TS 36.32, 3GPP TS 36.212 and 3GPP TS 36.101) by allowing users to autonomously select radio resources for transmitting V2V data and control information based on a sensing mechanism when they are out-of-coverage, from a resource pool pre-configured by the network. This mode of operation is referred to as \u201cMode 4\u201d in the standard. Pre-configured pools can be optionally mapped to geographical zones by the network, where the users select the pool according to its location, i.e., its zone.",
                        "However, the OOC case is not exhaustively tackled in the 3GPP standard: users are only allowed to make autonomous resource selection, which is not collision-free as opposed to in-coverage mode of operation for V2V. This has a negative impact on the reliability of the transmissions.",
                        "Moreover, the pools can only be semi-statically pre-configured by the network, which may easily result in resource usage inefficiency, i.e., under- or over-utilization of the radio resources. As OOC resource pools are not allowed to overlap with the in-coverage pools, this limits the size of the OOC resources.",
                        "Mapping of the OOC resource pools to zones is done very coarsely, allowing the zones to be defined only as equal-sized, rectangular/square-shaped geographical areas, which may again easily result in radio resource usage inefficiency, as the road and communication traffic of the vehicles are heterogeneously distributed over space and time.",
                        "Furthermore, characteristics of OOC areas (e.g., boundaries, durations) cannot be well reflected on the pre-configuration of the resource pools. Therefore, the OOC mode of operation defined by the state-of-art standard is not the optimum solution for resource allocation and can be improved in many ways.",
                        "In light of the above, there is a need for improved devices and methods for D2D communication, allowing allocating radio resources and transmitting data for D2D communication in a reliable and efficient manner."

For example, if a specific method step is described, a corresponding device may include a unit to perform the described method step, even if such unit is not explicitly described or illustrated in the figures.",
                        "Moreover, in the following detailed description as well as in the claims, embodiments with different functional blocks or processing units are described, which are connected with each other and/or which exchange signals. It will be appreciated that the present disclosure covers embodiments as well, which include additional functional blocks or processing units that are arranged between the functional blocks or processing units of the embodiments described below.",
                        "Finally, it is understood that the features of the various exemplary aspects described herein may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.",
                        "As will be described in more detail in the following, embodiments of the disclosure relate to a D2D or V2V communication network comprising at least a user entity (also referred to as a UE hereafter) and a network entity (also referred to as a base station hereafter), which allow for a significant increase in reliability and efficiency of radio resource utilization.",
                        "D2D (device-to-device) or V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication can take place when user equipments (UEs), in particular vehicular user equipments, are both in coverage and out of coverage (OOC) of the cellular network. V2V communication can consist of two different types of data traffic: first, periodic messages, e.g., cooperative awareness messages (CAMs), carrying information such as vehicle position and velocity; second, aperiodic messages, transmitted upon a triggering unexpected event, e.g., decentralized environmental notification messages (DENMs) for safety warning purposes.",
                        "A centralized network infrastructure entity, such as a base station, can manage radio resource allocation for in-coverage and OOC V2V communications. Modes of operation and resource pools for in-coverage and OOC communications are configured by the network infrastructure entity. The configuration information is periodically broadcast to users via system information messages, e.g., System Information Block 21 (SIB 21).",
                        "To determine if a user is out of coverage, a network entity (hereafter also referred to as a base station) can measure received powers of the users fading in/out over time around a certain location at a certain frequency; collect Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling (e.g., connection or state changes) or measurement reports of users over time at a certain location; or use a map information, e.g., installed by the network operator. The network infrastructure elements, e.g., base stations (BSs), performing the above functions can store information centrally or in a cooperating manner.",
                        "When the users are in coverage, resources can be allocated via a scheduled mode of operation (hereafter referred as \u201cMode 3\u201d as in the 3GPP standard), wherein the users can request transmission resources from the network entity, e.g., the base station. The base station then schedules resources for V2V data and control information transmission. V2V resources are bounded by the resource pools (configured by the network) as follows: normal transmission pools for in-coverage; pre-configured transmission pools for out-of-coverage; exceptional transmission pools for handover; or reception pools covering all above.",
                        "The schedule in coverage can be a dynamic or semi-persistent schedule (SPS). The semi-persistent schedule (SPS) is preferred for periodic V2V traffic, e.g., transmission of CAMs. SPS is configured, and activated/deactivated by the network entity. The users report their V2V traffic pattern information (message size, periodicity, priority, etc.) to the network entity, in order to assist this configuration. Activating multiple SPS configurations for single user is possible. When the users are in coverage, the network entity can collect location information and channel busy ratio (CBR) measurement reports from the users to make better resource allocations. Both in coverage and out of coverage of the cellular network, users can adapt their transmissions (e.g., modulation and coding scheme) based on CBR measurements.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram illustrating a communication network 100 comprising a user equipment (UE) 101 according to an embodiment and a network entity 131 according to an embodiment. The UE 101 is configured to communicate with one or more nearby UEs (not shown in FIG. 1) via a sidelink (i.e. D2D or V2V) communication channel and communicate with the network entity 131 via an uplink/downlink communication channel.",
                        "In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the UE 101 could be implemented in the form of a user equipment such as a mobile phone or a vehicle or a communication module of a vehicle. However, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure apply to user equipments other than mobile phones or vehicles as well. In an exemplary embodiment, the network entity 131 can be for instance a base station and is configured to manage communication resources in the cellular communication network 100.",
                        "As illustrated in FIG. 1, the UE 101 comprises a communication interface 103 configured to perform communication with one or more nearby UEs (not shown in FIG. 1) using one or more of a plurality of resources allocated by the network entity 131 in the cellular communication network 100. Furthermore, the UE 101 comprises a processing unit 105 configured to operate the UE 101 in a first mode and in a second mode, wherein the first mode is a scheduled resource allocation mode and the second mode is an autonomous resource selection mode or an idle mode, as already mentioned above. By way of example, the scheduled resource allocation mode can be a 3GPP LTE-A mode 3 and the autonomous resource selection mode can be a 3GPP LTE-A mode 4.",
                        "As will be described in more detail in the context of FIG. 2, the processing unit 105 is configured to switch from the first mode to the second mode, if a first condition relating to an out of coverage (OOC) event or status of the UE 101 is met and a second condition related to a further parameter is met.",
                        "In an embodiment, the second condition is met if one or more of the following conditions is met: a time elapsed since the start of the OOC event is larger than a time threshold; a distance travelled since the start of the OOC event is larger than a distance threshold; the UE 101 does not operate in the first mode with a probability, wherein the UE 101 stays in the first mode randomly with that probability; and/or a load of the resources allocated for the first mode is larger than a predefined threshold. The network entity 131 of the cellular communication network can be configured to provide the time threshold, the distance threshold and/or the probability to the UE 101.",
                        "In an embodiment, the network entity 131 is configured to generate a plurality of operation profiles associated with an expected OOC event on the basis of information provided by another UE having experienced the expected OOC event. Moreover, the network entity 131 is configured to provide the plurality of operation profiles to the UE 101. The UE can comprise a memory 107 (as shown in FIG. 1) configured to store the plurality of operation profiles, wherein the plurality of operation profiles can comprise at least one operation profile (a kind of default operation profile), wherein the processing unit can be configured to, until the second condition is met, operate the UE in the first mode according to the at least one default operation profile. An operation profile can define communication resources and/or a communication behaviour to be used by the UE 101.",
                        "In an embodiment, the network entity 131 is configured to determine a size of resource pools to be used by the UE 101 in the first mode and/or second mode, on the basis of information provided by another UE having experienced the expected OOC event. Furthermore, the network entity 131 can map the resource pools to be used by the UE 101 in the first mode and/or second mode to moving zones such as a moving group of vehicles, wherein zones can be further configured, e.g., by a timer or START/STOP times. The network entity 131 can also allocate downlink resources to be used by the UE 101 in the first mode and/or second mode.",
                        "If an unexpected OOC event occurs, the processing unit 105 can operate the UE 101 in the first mode according to another default operation profile in response to the unexpected OOC event. Furthermore, the processing unit 105 of the UE 101 can be configured to operate the UE 101 in the first mode by using active semi-persistent schedule (SPS) configurations and allocated resources for periodic, aperiodic and/or single transmissions, until the second condition is met.",
                        "If an expected OOC event occurs, on the other hand, the processing unit 105 of the UE 202 can be configured to operate the UE 101 in the first mode according to the operation profile associated with the expected OOC event, in response to the expected OOC event. Furthermore, the processing unit 105 can operate the UE 101 in the first mode by using active semi-persistent schedule (SPS) configurations and allocated resources for periodic transmissions, by selecting one or more of a plurality of resources assigned by the network entity 131 to be used during the expected OOC event and/or by using a one-shot schedule provided by the network entity 131. The one-shot schedule is a single, complete resource assignment to the UE 101 and can comprise, for instance, different time and frequency slots to be exclusively used starting from the time the OOC condition is met until the time the OOC condition is over.",
                        "According to a further embodiment, in case the second mode is an autonomous resource selection mode, the processing unit 105 of the UE 101 is further configured to operate the first mode in parallel with the second mode, in response to an OOC event until a second condition is met, in particular by using the first mode for periodic transmissions and the second mode for aperiodic transmissions.",
                        "According to a further embodiment, in case the second mode is an autonomous resource selection mode, the communication interface 103 of the UE 101 is configured to sense a load of the resources for the second mode and the processing unit 105 of the UE 101 is configured to replace a transmission on resources allocated for the first mode with a high priority transmission of the second mode, in particular in case the load of the resources for the second mode is larger than a load threshold for the second mode.",
                        "In response to an OOC event, the communication interface can also sense a load of the resources, in particular a CBR value, allocated for the first mode and the second condition is met if the sensed load is larger than a load threshold for the first mode.",
                        "Thus, in an embodiment, the communication interface 103 of the UE 101 is configured to sense a load of the resources, in particular a CBR value, allocated for the first mode and the processing unit 105 of the UE 101 is configured to record information about times and/or locations, at which the sensed load is larger than a load threshold, and/or context information of the UE 101, e.g. motion state, road conditions, and to provide the information to the network entity 131.",
                        "According to a further embodiment, the communication interface 103 of the UE 101 is configured to use downlink resources in the second mode, i.e. the autonomous resource selection mode. Furthermore, the communication interface 103 of the UE 101 is configured to transmit information (e.g. a counter) about the number of next transmissions of the same type, e.g., MAC PDUs of same size, belonging to the same sidelink communication process, in particular to reserve the same selected resources for that number of times on the communication interface 103 to other UEs.",
                        "In case the second mode is an autonomous resource selection mode, the communication interface 103 of the UE 101 can also transmit information about the number of upcoming transmissions of the communication interface 103 to other UEs, in case the number of transmissions is smaller than a threshold value (provided, for instance, by the network entity 131) and to transmit a random number for the number of transmissions, in case the number of transmissions is larger than the threshold value.",
                        "As discussed above, the embodiments of the present disclosure can exploit in-coverage radio resource management control for out-of-coverage (OOC) events, which is shown in FIG. 2. It is to be appreciated that the out-of-coverage (OOC) events refer to the situations in which the user equipments (UEs) 101 are out of coverage of the network entity, i.e. base station 103. FIG. 2 show a schematic diagram of the communication network 100 comprising a plurality of network entities 131a-b according to an embodiment and a plurality of UEs 101a-h according to an embodiment, wherein an OOC event occurs as the UEs 101a-h enter a tunnel, which is limited by the network infrastructure (base stations) at the two ends of the tunnel. The base stations 131a-b can cooperate to control the radio resources for V2V communications for the OOC event. According to an embodiment radio resource can be managed in response to the OOC event on the basis of one or more of the following steps.",
                        "In step 1, the UEs 101a-h can keep their allocated or \u201cpre-scheduled\u201d resources in coverage especially for periodic or semi-persistent transmissions for OOC events, hence extending resource allocations in the first mode, i.e. Mode 3, to the OOC situations. This solution is also referred to as \u201cExtended Mode 3\u201d hereafter.",
                        "In step 2, embodiments of the disclosure allow coexistence of the Extended Mode 3 and the Mode 4 operation (i.e. the second mode or UE autonomous resource selection) as well as interaction between the Extended Mode 3 and the Mode 4 operation in OOC situations.",
                        "In step 3, embodiments of the disclosure can improve the Mode 4 resource allocation and selection procedures for OOC events. In step 4, the UEs 101a-h can also provide information about the OOC situations to the network infrastructure entities 131a-b, i.e. the base stations, when they are back in coverage of the cellular network 100.",
                        "According to the current standard, the UEs 101 generally switch completely to the autonomous resource selection (i.e. mode 4) if they are out of coverage of the base station. On the other hand, according to an embodiment, the mode 3 can be extended into the area out of coverage in certain OOC scenarios in order to achieve higher reliability and resource usage efficiency. The OOC events comprise the following two types: a Type I OOC event, being unexpected or unknown by the network entity 131; or a Type II OOC event, being expected or known by the network entity, i.e. base station 131.",
                        "FIG. 3 shows a schematic diagram of the communication network 100 comprising the network entity 131 according to an embodiment and a plurality of UEs 101a-b according to an embodiment, wherein the Type I OOC event may occur, e.g., because of extreme fading conditions for the UE 101a, as the UE 101a enters an area in which the communication with the base station 131 is hindered by a building or other obstacles.",
                        "In such case, as shown in FIG. 4, the UEs 101 can operate in Extended Mode 3 and keep using their latest scheduled resources or SPS configurations/resources for periodic transmissions, according to a default operation profile configured by the network entity 131 (stage 403). The default operation profile of UEs 101 in case of an unexpected OOC event, can be broadcast to all UEs 101 by the base station(s) 131 via SIB21 message. The default user operation profile indicates the users to keep their latest allocated resources according to a threshold, e.g., a timer, a probability, or a distance from the network coverage boundary, after they enter the OOC area. After the threshold is exceeded, the user releases the Extended Mode 3 resources, namely completely switches to Mode 4, while the user is still out of coverage (stage 405).",
                        "FIG. 5 show a schematic diagram of the communication network 100 comprising a plurality of network entities 131a-b according to an embodiment and a plurality of UEs 101a-g according to an embodiment, wherein a type II OOC event occurs, which is known and expected by the network entities 131a-b (i.e. base stations), e.g., as a road tunnel bounded by the network coverage at two ends.",
                        "In such a case, the base stations 131a-b can allocate or \u201cpre-schedule\u201d the OOC resources specific to request of each UE 101a-g and/or provide additional configuration/information for the OOC event when allocating the resources. When the UEs 101a-g enter the out of coverage area, the UEs 101a-g can use this resource allocation and behave according to the specific configuration.",
                        "The resource allocation can be in form of providing a semi-persistent-schedule (SPS) or a one-shot schedule for the entire OOC area. Multiple resources can be provided to the UEs 101, among which the UEs 101 can select one resource autonomously for the OOC event, based on, e.g., sensing results. The specific configuration can be providing the schedule (SPS or one-shot) with a threshold, e.g., a timer and/or a probability, for each user to keep using the allocated resources when they enter the out of coverage area.",
                        "After the threshold is exceeded, the UEs 101 can release the Extended Mode 3 resources, namely completely switch to Mode 4, while they are still out of coverage of the base stations 131. The specific OOC configuration can be sent to the UEs 101 by RRC signaling, e.g., SPS activation or DCI 5A messages. With a known/expected OOC event, the network entity 131 will have a chance to make predictions in order to make better radio resource management for V2V communication under an OOC event.",
                        "Exemplary resource utilization for providing a semi-persistent-schedule (SPS) and a one-shot schedule by the UE 101 according to an embodiment are illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 respectively.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 6, the network entity or base station 131 can activate a semi-persistent-schedule (SPS) in response to an OOC event with a timer or probability and the UE 101 can use the specific SPS and operate in extended mode 3 according to an operation profile configured by the base station 131 upon entry into an OOC area expected by the base station 131 (stage 603). Afterwards, the UE 101 can release resources from extended mode 3 when the SPS timer expires or with the indicated probability and switch to mode 4 completely (stage 605).",
                        "Similar to FIG. 6, FIG. 7 shows resource utilization and allocation for providing a one-shot schedule to the UE 101 according to an embodiment, wherein the base station 131, implemented, for instance, as an eNB, can signal a complete one-shot schedule as soon as the UE 101 enters an out of coverage area and the UE 101 can use a one-shot schedule throughout an OOC area expected by the network entity 131 (stage 703).",
                        "In response to an OOC event, the UEs 101 can make autonomous resource selection (Mode 4) for aperiodic transmissions (e.g., decentralized environmental notification messages or DENMs). This mode can be operated in parallel or/and through interaction with the Extended Mode 3 for an OOC event, as will be further described in more detail further below.",
                        "According to an embodiment, the UEs 101 make sensing on the allocated resources in Extended Mode 3 when they are out of coverage, and the UEs 101 may release Extended Mode 3 resources based on the sensing result, e.g., release if the sensed receive power is above a threshold. The threshold to release Extended Mode 3, e.g., a CBR value, can be further configured by the network entity 131 and signaled to the UEs 101 before they enter the area out of coverage.",
                        "The UEs 101 may release Extended Mode 3 and switch to Mode 4 while they are still out of coverage, which can occur even before the timer or the distance indicated by the base station 131, if the sensing threshold is exceeded, e.g., due to large number of collisions.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows resource allocation and utilization based on a sensing result by the UE 101 according to an embodiment, wherein the UE 101 can operate in Extended Mode 3 and keep using its latest scheduled resources (stage 803) and later the UE 101 can release resources, i.e. stop transmitting, in Extended Mode 3 based on a sensing result and switch to mode 4 completely (stage 805).",
                        "In case of congestion in aperiodic traffic, which is operated by Mode 4, the UE 101 can preempt, i.e., skip, the pre-scheduled Extended Mode 3 transmissions with lower priority (e.g., cooperative awareness messages, CAMs) to transmit high priority messages (e.g., crash notification).",
                        "The SPSs allowed to be preempted for certain priorities can be further configured by the network entity 131 i.e. the base station and signaled to the UE 101 before the UE 101 enters the OOC area. FIG. 9 shows a schematic diagram of preempting Extended Mode 3 transmissions by the UE 101 according to an embodiment for high priority aperiodic messages, wherein the UE 101 first operates in extended mode 3 (stage 901), then senses congestion in mode 4 traffic and has a high-priority transmission such as crash notification DENM. The UE 101 can thus preempt or skip an Extended Mode 3 transmission with a low priority (stage 903), for instance, the UE 101 can replace a cooperative awareness message (CAM) by a decentralized environmental notification messages (DENMs) providing information about a car crash.",
                        "In an embodiment, the network entity 131 can better allocate the resources for an OOC event (both in Extended Mode 3 and Mode 4) via the following advantageous embodiments.",
                        "In a first embodiment, the network entity 131 can improve the configuration of OOC resource pools in case of a Type II OOC event, i.e. an expected/known OOC event, by determining the size of Mode 4 OOC resource pools based on the information about the OOC event provided by the UEs 101. Instead of geographical zones, moving zones can be mapped to the OOC resources. Each zone can be allocated to a group, i.e., a cluster of road or data traffic users. Moving zones can be configured by a timer to be used by the UEs 101 to keep using the corresponding resources for an OOC event. This is also useful when the UEs 101 cannot determine their location (e.g., inside a tunnel) to find the geographical zone according to the current standard.",
                        "In a further embodiment, the network entity 131 can include downlink (DL) spectrum into the resource pool for V2V communication under an OOC event, while resources for V2V communications are allocated from the uplink spectrum according to the conventional standard.",
                        "In case of a Type II OOC event (i.e. an expected/known OOC event), the network entity 131 according to an embodiment may allocate resource pools for the OOC usage, also from the downlink (DL) spectrum. The OOC pools are configured to be used after a time or distance away from the in-coverage\u2014OOC boundary so as to not interfere with in-coverage DL traffic. The pools belonging to the DL spectrum could be further configured by the network entity 131 and signaled to the UEs 101 before they enter an OOC area. Included DL frequency bands for V2X operation can be provided as \u201cinter-band carrier aggregation\u201d.",
                        "Additionally, the autonomous resource selection procedure in Mode 4 under an OOC event can also be improved by the UE 101 according to a further embodiment. In the current standard, the UEs 101 keep (reserve) each resource they selected based on sensing for a random number of transmission times, and announce this value (the resource reselection counter) to the other UEs via Sidelink Control Information (SCI). In turn, other UEs exclude that resource when making sensing for that number of times. Therefore, if the UE 101 transmits less than the announced number, the reserved resources will not be used at all.",
                        "Instead, the UE 101 according to an embodiment in OOC Mode 4 can reserve and announce their \u201cactual\u201d number of transmissions in Sidelink Control Information (SCI) instead of a random value. Announcing the actual number can especially increase the resource efficiency for one-shot or small number of transmissions, so as not to reserve or occupy the resources more than the required number of times. The actual number of transmissions could be announced, if the number is below a threshold value determined by the network entity 131. For numbers above that threshold, the UEs 101 may again choose a random number.",
