                        "The lymphatic vasculature represents a second circulation, parallel to the blood vasculature, that accounts for the clearance of interstitial fluid (ISF) with its constituent proteins and other solutes not absorbed across postcapillary venules. In most vascularized tissues, the lymphatic system is critical to both hydrostatic and homeostatic maintenance. Yet, the brain does not have histologically identifiable lymphatic vessels and thus lacks the discrete pathways for interstitial solute and fluid clearance present in other peripheral tissues. This is surprising, because the high metabolic rate and exquisite sensitivity of neurons and glia to alterations in their extracellular environment suggest a need for rapid clearance of ISF and solutes.",
                        "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the central nervous system (CNS) has been thought to play a role in solute clearance from the brain. CSF formed in the choroid plexi flows through the cerebral ventricles and the subarachnoid space to its ultimate sites of reabsorption into the bloodstream via arachnoid villi of the dural sinuses, along cranial nerve sheaths or through the nasal lymphatics. Interstitial solutes have been thought to be cleared to the CSF by the convective bulk flow of ISF, which courses diffusely through brain tissue, rather than through an anatomically or functionally discrete structure.",
                        "Accumulation of toxic dysfunctional proteins in the mammalian central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans. However, the mechanism that leads to the accumulation of toxins in the aging mammalian brain is not completely known. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) two hallmarks are senile plaques, which are extracellular deposits of amyloid \u03b2 (also referred to herein as amyloid-\u03b2, amyloid beta or A\u03b2) toxins, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau). The \u201camyloid cascade\u201d hypothesis suggests that the cognitive decline and the distinct pathogenic features in AD are related to abnormal accumulation of these toxins (Selkoe, D. J. \u201cClearing the Brain's Amyloid Cobwebs.\u201d Neuron 32, no. 2 (2001): 177-80; Hardy, J. \u201cA Hundred Years of Alzheimer's Disease Research.\u201d Neuron 52, no. 1 (2006): 3-13).",

According to the method, a portion of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed, by transporting the fluid to another portion of the patient's body. Also disclosed in U.S. Pat.

From near-midline sagittal MRIs, ROIs can be drawn on four sagittal slices in each hemisphere and the signals from each of the anatomical ROIs can be averaged using PMOD software (PMOD Version 3.307, PMOD Technologies, Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland). The ROIs can include, for example, the pituitary recess, pineal recess, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, pontine nucleus and/or aqueduct. The TACs for each ROI can be extracted via the PKMod module. The area under the curve (AUC) for each ROI's TAC can be calculated using the \u2018trapezoidal rule\u2019 (see Example 2 for further details). The calculated AUCs can be normalized by dividing each subject's AUC by the number of the corresponding time intervals used for that particular study referred to as \u2018mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC)\u2019 calculated as: (mAUC=AUC/(n\u22121)). Furthermore, to minimize potential differences in the amount of paramagnetic contrast delivered to each subject or patient within a group, the mAUC of the pituitary recess (which represent the major input and source of contrast) can be used to normalize the other regions mAUCs. Subsequently, the mean mAUC-ratios can be compared between groups or subjects for each anatomical location using a two-sided independent t-test.",

A volume-of-interest mask containing the brain only can be created for the cluster analysis. The number of clusters (K) used was determined by the K which was able to segment out voxels adjacent to the large vessels such as basilar artery (including pituitary recess) and olfactory artery complex. This was done on an interactive, per animal basis. Each analysis was performed using a 50% percentile threshold (i.e. only 50% of the pixels with the highest signal changes (sum of squared TAC values were used). The number of clusters which provided the most ideal visualization of para-vascular inflow conduits was 4 clusters.

                                "Because the brain lacks a lymphatic circulation, it must clear extracellular proteins by an alternative mechanism. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) functions as a sink for brain extracellular solutes, but it is not clear how solutes from the brain interstitium move from the parenchyma to the CSF. This example demonstrates that a substantial portion of subarachnoid CSF cycles through the brain interstitial space. On the basis of in vivo two-photon imaging of small fluorescent tracers, this example demonstrates that CSF enters the parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround penetrating arteries and that brain interstitial fluid is cleared along paravenous drainage pathways. Animals lacking the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes exhibit slowed CSF influx through this system and a \u02dc70% reduction in interstitial solute clearance, suggesting that the bulk fluid flow between these anatomical influx and efflux routes is supported by astrocytic water transport. Fluorescent-tagged amyloid \u03b2, a peptide thought to be pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease, was transported along this route, and deletion of the Aqp4 gene suppressed the clearance of soluble amyloid \u03b2, suggesting that this pathway removes amyloid \u03b2 from the central nervous system. Clearance through paravenous flow can also regulate extracellular levels of proteins involved with neurodegenerative conditions, its impairment contributing to the mis-accumulation of soluble proteins.",

                                "The lymphatic vasculature represents a second circulation, parallel to the blood vasculature, that accounts for the clearance of interstitial fluid (ISF) with its constituent proteins and other solutes not absorbed across postcapillary venules (1, 2). In most vascularized tissues, the lymphatic system is critical to both hydrostatic and homeostatic maintenance. Yet, the brain does not have histologically identifiable lymphatic vessels and thus lacks the discrete pathways for interstitial solute and fluid clearance present in other peripheral tissues (3-5). This is surprising, because the high metabolic rate and exquisite sensitivity of neurons and glia to alterations in their extracellular environment suggest a need for rapid clearance of ISF and solutes.",
                                "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the central nervous system (CNS) has been thought to play a role in solute clearance from the brain (6). CSF formed in the choroid plexi flows through the cerebral ventricles and the subarachnoid space to its ultimate sites of reabsorption into the bloodstream via arachnoid villi of the dural sinuses, along cranial nerve sheaths or through the nasal lymphatics (3, 7, 8). Interstitial solutes have been thought to be cleared to the CSF by the convective bulk flow of ISF, which courses diffusely through brain tissue, rather than through an anatomically or functionally discrete structure (3, 4, 9). Here, in vivo two-photon imaging and other techniques have been used to investigate the flow of subarachnoid CSF into and through the brain interstitium.",

Thirty minutes after injection, fluorescent tracer distribution differed radically from the pattern observed after the tracers were injected into the ventricles (FIGS. 1H and K, compare to FIGS. 1B and E). Large-molecular weight FITC-d2000 (molecular size, 2000 kD) entered the brain along paravascular spaces, was confined there, and did not enter the surrounding interstitial space (FIGS. 1K and L). TR-d3 (molecular size, 3 kD) concentrated in the paravascular spaces but also entered the interstitium both from the paravascular space (FIGS. 1K and L) and from the pial surface (FIG. 1M). TR-d3 was more widely distributed than FITC-d2000, which is mainly localized paravascularly. The lower-molecular weight A594 (molecular size, 759 daltons) moved quickly throughout the brain interstitium, and only small amounts concentrated within paravascular spaces (FIGS. 1H and J). Both A594 and TR-d3 moved slowly and uniformly into the brain from the pial surface (FIGS. 1H, K, and M). Parenchymal distribution of tracers of different molecular weights was then quantified by image analysis (FIG. 7). Whereas A594 permeated virtually the entire brain volume within 30 min of injection, penetration of the higher-molecular weight tracers proved more restricted (FIG. 1N).",
                                "These findings were confirmed intracisternal radiotracer injection. Within 45 min of injection, \u02dc40% of injected [3H]mannitol (molecular size, 182 daltons; FIG. 8) was detectable in the brain (FIG. 1O). A larger tracer ([3H]dextran-10; molecular size, 10 kD) accumulated in the brain more slowly (FIG. 1O). Because water has a 10-fold lower molecular weight than mannitol, the CSF flux reflected by [3H]mannitol accumulation (\u02dc40% of total subarachnoid CSF) likely underestimates the true movement of CSF into the brain parenchyma. Previous studies that have evaluated the penetration of subarachnoid CSF into the brain have used tracers such as inulin (molecular size, \u02dc5 kD), albumin (molecular size, 66 kD), and dextrans (molecular size, 3 to 2000 kD) (10, 11). The findings in this example show that higher-molecular weight tracers are preferentially excluded from the brain parenchyma, suggesting that previous studies may have systematically underestimated \u201cretrograde\u201d subarachnoid CSF flow into the brain by basing their analyses on larger tracers.",

By imaging through a closed cranial window in anesthetized mice (FIG. 2A), the movement of intracisternally injected fluorescent dextrans into the cerebral cortex was visualized. The cerebral vasculature was labeled with blood-brain barrier (BBB)-impermeant fluorescent dextran (CB-dl 0) (intravenously), and penetrating arteries and veins were identified morphologically (FIG. 2B).",
                                "After injection, the tracers rapidly entered the brain along the outside of cortical surface arteries and penetrating arterioles (FIGS. 2B and C and FIGS. 9A-D) through a pathway immediately surrounding the vascular smooth muscle cells (FIGS. 2F to J, and FIGS. 3C and E) and bounded by perivascular astrocytic endfeet (FIGS. 2K and L, and FIGS. 4B to D). This para-arterial CSF movement was seen as FITC-d40 (molecular size, 40 kD) influx more than \u02dc35 min after intracisternal injection at the cortical surface, 60 and 120 mm below the cortical surface. Rapid tracer movement along the margins of surface arteries, rather than through the subarachnoid CSF, is consistent with the presence of paravascular sheaths surrounding cerebral surface arteries, as described by Weller (12). These paravascular spaces are continuous with the subarachnoid space yet provide distinct channels for the rapid para-arterial bulk flow of CSF into the parenchyma, driven by arterial pulsation (13-15).",
                                "When TR-d3 (molecular size, 3 kD) and FITC-d2000 (molecular size, 2000 kD) were injected, both rapidly entered the paravascular spaces along penetrating cortical arteries, despite large differences in their respective molecular weights (FIGS. 9C and D). This suggested that their transit occurs via bulk CSF flow through the paravascular spaces (4, 16). In contrast, movement from the paravascular spaces into the surrounding tissue differed between FITC-d2000 and TR-d3. TR-d3 readily entered the interstitium, whereas the larger FITC-d2000 remained confined to the paravascular space (FIG. 2C to E, and FIGS. 9B to D). A recent study demonstrated that astrocytic endfeet cover most of the surface area of the murine cerebral microcirculation so that access to the parenchyma is provided only by \u02dc20-nm clefts between overlapping endfeet (17). This suggests that perivascular astrocytic endfeet may serve a sieving function, thereby accounting for the size dependence of paravascular solute entry into the interstitium. Although water and small solutes may freely enter the brain interstitium from the paravascular spaces by bulk flow, large-molecular weight solutes [FITC-d2000; diameter of hydration (dH)>32 nm (9)] are excluded, whereas smaller solutes [for example, ovalbumin and TR-d3; dH=2 to 3 nm and 6.1 nm, respectively (9)] pass the endfeet in a size- and structure-dependent manner (FIG. 2E and FIGS. 9B to D).",

                                "In vivo imaging demonstrated para-arterial influx of subarachnoid CSF into the cortex. However, because two-photon imaging cannot image tracer fluxes through deeper brain structures, an ex vivo approach was next used to map paravascular CSF influx and clearance throughout the brain. The distribution of the moderate molecular weight tracer ovalbumin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 647 (OA-647; molecular size, 45 kD) was analyzed in fixed vibratome sections of the Tie2-GFP:NG2-DsRed double-transgenic reporter mouse, in which arteries could be easily distinguished from veins (FIG. 10A). Immediately after intracisternal injection, the tracer moved rapidly inward along penetrating arteries and arterioles to reach the terminal capillary beds throughout the brain (FIG. 3A), with the largest influxes occurring along large ventral perforating arteries of the basal ganglia and thalamus (FIG. 3D and FIGS. 100 to E). The tracer was not observed around veins at early time points (<10 min after injection). At longer time points (>1 hour), tracers that had been injected intracisternally accumulated along capillaries and parenchymal venules (FIGS. 3F and G). The tracer exited the brain primarily along two paravenous routes: the medial internal cerebral veins and the lateral-ventral caudal rhinal veins (FIG. 3H). Intraparenchymal tracer injected directly into the cortex, striatum, or thalamus was cleared along the same common anatomical pathways, traveling either posterior-medially toward the internal cerebral veins or posterior-lateral-ventrally along the external capsule until its exit from the parenchyma along the caudal rhinal veins (FIGS. 11A to E). These results demonstrated that ISF and CSF that is moving through the brain parenchyma are cleared along the same paravenous drainage pathways.",
                                "Astroglial water transport supports CSF flux into the parenchyma The localization of astroglial aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel is highly polarized to perivascular endfeet (FIG. 4A) that bound the para-arterial CSF influx and the paravenous ISF clearance pathways (FIGS. 4B to D). These astrocytic water channels provide low-resistance pathways for fluid movement between these paravascular spaces and the interstitium, linking paravascular and interstitial bulk flow and maintaining convective currents (3, 9) that drive the clearance of interstitial solutes from the brain parenchyma. To investigate this, it was determined whether increasing parenchymal resistance to fluid flux by the global knockout of the Aqp4 gene altered CSF flux through the interstitium. When CSF tracer influx was imaged ex vivo, tracer movement into the brain parenchyma was markedly reduced in Aqp4-null compared to wild-type control mice (FIGS. 4E and F, and FIGS. 12A and B). In vivo imaging confirmed these findings. After intra-cisternal injection, FITC-d2000 movement along the para-arteriolar inflow path was not significantly slowed in Aqp4-null mice (FIGS. 4G and H), demonstrating that bulk flow through the proximal segment of the para-arterial influx pathway (the Virchow-Robin space) was not compromised by Aqp4 deletion. In contrast, TR-d3 movement from the paravascular space into the surrounding interstitium was effectively abolished in Aqp4-null mice (FIGS. 4G and I). It was confirmed that in Aqp4-null mice, the paravascular spaces surrounding penetrating cortical arterioles were ultrastructurally normal through the depth of the cortex (FIGS. 12C to E) and that intracisternally injected FITC-d40 was detectable within the paravascular space of Aqp4-null as well as in that of wild-type mice by electron microscopy (FIGS. 12C and D).",
                                "Differences in AQP4 expression may contribute to the polarization of bulk flow along these para-arterial CSF influx and paravenous ISF clearance pathways AQP4 immunoreactivity in NG2-DsRed animals (in which veins and arteries can be distinguished) was therefore assessed to define the relative amount of AQP4 expression in periarterial, perivenous, and pericapillary endfeet. Whereas perivenous and pericapillary endfeet did not differ in AQP4 expression, periarterial endfeet exhibited significantly less AQP4 immunoreactivity (FIGS. 13A to C). When non-endfoot AQP4 expression around arteries and veins was compared to expression around capillaries, reduced periarterial expression was clear (FIGS. 13A, B and D). This effect was largely due to a subpopulation of penetrating arteries that exhibited sharply diminished AQP4 immunoreactivity (FIGS. 13A and D).",

                                "These data demonstrate that astroglial water flux facilitates the movement of subarachnoid CSF into and through the brain interstitium. One possible function for this transparenchymal CSF flux is the clearance of fluid and solutes from the brain interstitium.",
                                "This was tested by examining the effect of Aqp4 gene deletion upon the clearance of radiolabeled [3H]mannitol from the brain parenchyma (FIG. 14A). In Aqp4-null mice, [3H]mannitol clearance from the brain interstitium was reduced by \u02dc70% compared to that of wild-type animals (FIG. 5A). In wild-type mice, the rate of clearance for [3H]dextran-10 (with a 55-fold larger molecular size than mannitol) was identical to that of [3H]mannitol (FIG. 14B), confirming that bulk ISF flow rather than diffusion is responsible for the clearance of these interstitial-delivered tracers (4, 9). The clearance of [3H]dextran-10 was also significantly reduced in Aqp4-null mice (FIG. 14B). The present example demonstrates that astroglial AQP4 supports the bulk ISF flow that drives the clearance of interstitial solutes from the brain parenchyma. AQP4 facilitates the para-vascular clearance of interstitial amyloid \u03b2 Soluble amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) is present in the interstitium of the healthy young brain, yet interstitial A\u03b2 levels are correlated with amyloid plaque burden (18).",

After intrastriatal injection of 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40, the compound was rapidly cleared from the brain (FIG. 6A). In agreement with the receptor-mediated efflux of A\u03b2 across the BBB (19), the rate of 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 clearance from the brain exceeded that of either [3H]mannitol or [3H]dextran-10, which lacks specific efflux receptors (FIG. 14A-B). In Aqp4-null mice, the rate of 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 clearance was reduced by \u02dc55% (FIG. 6A) compared to that of wild-type controls. This suggests that a large proportion of soluble A\u03b2 is removed by bulk flow along the gliovascular clearance system rather than locally across the BBB. In support of this conclusion, fluorescent-tagged A\u03b2 was observed to move rapidly along the vasculature when injected in the striatum, accumulating along the microvasculature and large-caliber internal cerebral and caudal rhinal veins (FIGS. 6B to D).",
                                "Soluble A\u03b2 is also present in the CSF, from which it may be cleared by transport across the choroid plexus (20), as well as by bulk CSF turnover (21). It was thus asked whether soluble A\u03b21-40 within the CSF compartment recirculates through the brain parenchyma. After intracisternal 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 injection, brain 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 levels increased in a manner comparable to [3H]dextran-10 (FIG. 6E, compare to FIG. 1O). In the Aqp4-null mouse, bulk influx of 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 was significantly reduced compared to wild types (FIG. 6E). These data suggest that although interstitial soluble A\u03b2 is cleared along the gliovascular pathway, a portion of A\u03b2 within the CSF compartment may recirculate through the brain along this same route.",

                                "FIGS. 14A-B shows measurement of interstitial solute clearance from the brain. (A) Schematic diagram depicting the measurement of interstitial solute clearance from the brain parenchyma. 3H-mannitol, 3H-dextran-10 or 125I-amyloid \u03b21-40 was injected into the striatum. To quantify radio-tracer clearance from the parenchyma, the brain was harvested at t=1 or 2 hrs following radio-tracer injection. Brains were solubilized, then total brain radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The remaining brain radioactivity (R\u2032Brain) was calculated based upon the total measured brain radioactivity (RBrain) and the total injected radioactivity (Rlnject). When the brain was harvested, the dura was removed. Thus the measured RBrain value does not include radio-tracer present within the subarachnoid space. (B) The effect of Aqp4 gene deletion upon the clearance of intra-parenchymally injected 3H-dextran-10 from the brain. In wild type animals, both 3H-mannitol and 3H-dextran-10 were cleared from the brain at identical rates. This is consistent with the observation that bulk flow [in contrast to diffusion(9)]-mediated transport is independent of molecular weight(4). Aqp4 gene deletion had an effect upon the efflux of 3H-dextran-10 similar to that of 3H-mannitol (FIG. 14B), markedly reducing the rate of their clearance from the brain parenchyma (*P<0.01, n=4 per time point).",
                                "FIGS. 15A-B are schematic diagrams of paravascular and interstitial bulk flow pathways. (A) Schematic depicting the proposed role of periarterial astroglial endfoot AQP4 in facilitating bulk water flow between the para-arterial influx pathway and the interstitial compartment. Because of high AQP4 expression, water passes freely across the perivascular endfoot. Small solutes, including the fluorescent tracer TR-d3 (MW 3 kD), follow the resulting osmotic gradient into the interstitium through intercellular clefts between overlapping endfoot processes. Large solutes, including FITC-d2000 (MW 2000 kD), cannot pass this cleft and are retained in the paravascular space. In Aqp4-null mice, water flux between the paravascular space and the interstitium is reduced, as is accompanying solute movement into the interstitium. Inset depicts physical dimensions of TR-d3, FITC-d2000 [dH, hydration diameter (9] and the inter-endfoot cleft (17). (B) Detailed schematic depicting the proposed role of astroglial AQP4 in maintaining convective ISF bulk flow and interstitial solute clearance. Para-arterial and paravenous AQP4 permits the free movement of water between the para-arterial influx and paravenous clearance pathway. This convective water flux sweeps interstitial solutes and tracers (such as 3H-mannitol and 3H-dextran-10) along its path. In Aqp4-null mice, water flux between the paravascular spaces and the interstitium are reduced, resulting in the failure of interstitial solute clearance. Inset depicts the physical dimensions of 3H-mannitol, 3H-dextran-10 and the inter-endfoot cleft.",
                                "Discussion",
                                "In this example, a brain-wide pathway is identified for fluid transport in mice, which includes the para-arterial influx of sub-arachnoid CSF into the brain interstitium, followed by the clearance of ISF along large-caliber draining veins. Interstitial bulk flow between these influx and efflux pathways depends upon trans-astrocytic water movement, and the continuous movement of fluid through this system is a critical contributor to the clearance of interstitial solutes, likely including soluble A\u03b21-40, from the brain. In light of its dependence on glial water flux, and its subservience of a lymphatic function in interstitial solute clearance, this system has been named the \u201cglymphatic\u201d pathway (FIG. 5B and FIGS. 15A-B).",
                                "The relationship between the CSF compartment and the peripheral lymphatics is well established (8). In mammals, \u02dc50% of radiolabeled albumin injected into the CSF drains to the cervical lymphatics via the cribriform plate, whereas the remainder is cleared to the bloodstream via arachnoid granulations of the dural sinuses (22-24). These recognized patterns of drainage initially led to the concept that CSF serves a \u201clymphatic\u201d function through its exchange with brain ISF along paravascular spaces (6, 25). Consistent with our findings reported here, studies in the rat demonstrated that as much as 75% of tracer injected into the brain interstitium was cleared to the sub-arachnoid CSF, accounting for about 11% of total CSF production (26). In this example, the identification of paravenous pathways, particularly those surrounding the medial internal cerebral and caudal rhinal veins, as the primary route for clearance is in contrast to some studies identifying para-arterial sheaths as pathways for tracer clearance (26, 27). This para-arterial labeling after intraparenchymal injections is largely an artifact of high local intraparenchymal pressure from the injection and does not reflect the natural pathway for solute efflux. With intraparenchymal injections, para-arterial spaces accumulated tracer close to the injection site. If observations are limited to these sites, then it might mistakenly be concluded that tracer efflux is occurring primarily along para-arterial efflux pathways. However, at locations most remote from the injection site, tracer accumulation was greatest surrounding large-caliber draining veins (FIG. 3H and FIG. 11E).",
                                "These results confirm, in part, the basic observations of Rennels et al. (15, 28) in which horseradish peroxidase (molecular size, 40 kD) injected into subarachnoid space at the cisterna magna in the cat moved rapidly into the brain along para-arterial pathways. These findings were rebutted by Cserr and colleagues, who concluded that paravascular influx of subarachnoid CSF was \u201cslow and variable in direction\u201d (11, 29). The present findings, including in vivo two-photon imaging (FIGS. 2A-L and 9A-D), ex vivo analysis with double-transgenic reporter mice (FIGS. 1A-O, 3A-H, 10A-E and 11A-E), and quantitative radiotracer experiments (FIG. 1O), refute this conclusion. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is the previous studies' choice of larger-molecular weight tracers. In vivo (FIGS. 2B-E and 9A-D) and ex vivo imaging, as well as radiotracer influx data (FIG. 1O), demonstrate that tracer influx from the sub-arachnoid space into the brain parenchyma is dependent upon molecular weight. In previous studies evaluating the movement of subarachnoid CSF into the brain parenchyma, inulin (molecular size, \u02dc5 kD), albumin (molecular size, 66 kD), and dextrans (usually 2000 kD) are typically used as CSF tracers (3, 10, 11, 29). On the basis of these findings, these studies underestimated the extent and rate of subarachnoid CSF influx into the brain interstitium. Other methodological differences appear to be at play as well. Pullen et al. used an open ventriculo-cisternal and cisterno-cisternal perfusion method that left the cisternal outflow tube open to the atmosphere for sample collection (29). Ichimura et al. pressure injected tracer directly into the paravascular and subarachnoid space at the site of observation (11). In experiments (data not shown), it was found that when the dura was pierced, as in the methodology used by Cserr and colleagues (11, 29), paravascular tracer flux was virtually abolished, suggesting that the maintenance of the hydraulic integrity of the subarachnoid and paravascular spaces is critical for maintaining paravascular bulk flow.",
                                "Role of AQP4 in Paravascular Pathway Function",
                                "These data suggest that AQP4-dependent astroglial water fluxes couple para-arterial CSF influx to paravenous ISF clearance within the brain. AQP4 has been implicated in water uptake into the brain tissue during the evolution of cytotoxic edema, as well as in water clearance after vasogenic edema (30, 31). These observations suggest that perivascular AQP4 facilitates the influx of subarachnoid CSF from para-arterial spaces into the brain interstitium, as well as the subsequent clearance of ISF via convective bulk flow (3, 4). Bulk flow CSF movement was observed along para-arterial pathways directly using in vivo two-photon imaging of intracisternally injected TR-d3 and FITC-d2000 Both of these agents moved rapidly along the wall of pial arteries to enter the Virchow-Robin spaces without mixing with CSF in the surrounding subarachnoid compartment (FIG. 2B). Consistent with ultrastructural analyses of leptomeningeal vessels conducted by Weller (12), this indicates that the paravascular space around surface arteries and the Virchow-Robin space into which these penetrate comprise a physically and functionally distinct subcompartment through which CSF rapidly enters the brain parenchyma by bulk flow. This CSF flux is likely driven by arterial pulsation (13-15): the directionality of CSF influx into para-arterial spaces perhaps reflecting the differing pulse pressures between para-arterial and paravenous pathways.",
                                "Perivascular astrocytic endfeet provide complete coverage of the cerebral microvasculature, with only 20-nm clefts between overlapping processes providing direct communication with the interstitium (17). This interposes a high-resistance barrier to fluid and solute flux between paravascular and interstitial compartments. AQP4, which occupies \u02dc50% of the surface area of capillary-facing endfeet (32), constitutes a low-resistance pathway for water movement between these compartments. Transglial water movement, presumably driven by the hydrostatic pressure of para-arterial bulk flow, may drive solute flux from the paravascular space into the interstitium, either via specific astroglial solute transporters or through the intercellular cleft between endfeet. This role for AQP4 is supported by the effect of Aqp4 gene deletion on the movement of TR-d3 between the paravascular space and the surrounding interstitium. The sieving effect of the endfeet (restricting the movement of solutes as they approach a dH of 20 nm) may account for the influence of molecular weight on tracer penetration into the interstitium (FIGS. 15A-B).",
                                "As subarachnoid CSF enters the interstitium and mixes with ISF, both are cleared together with any associated solutes (including soluble A\u03b2) along specific paravenous pathways, including both the internal cerebral and the caudal rhinal veins. These veins drain directly into the great vein of Galen and the straight sinus (internal cerebral vein) and the transverse sinus (caudal rhinal vein) (33). As with the para-arterial influx route, AQP4 localized to astroglial endfeet around the microvasculature, and these large draining veins provide a low-resistance pathway for water and accompanying solute efflux into the paravenous compartment. This is consistent with the observation that in Aqp4-null animals, bulk flow-dependent clearance of interstitial solutes was reduced by \u02dc70%. The relationship between these paravenous spaces and the dural sinuses can provide a low-pressure sink that, in combination with arterial pulsations within the subarachnoid space, results in an arteriovenous hydrostatic gradient that drives paravascular CSF bulk flow and ISF clearance. In this context, the higher expression of perivascular AQP4 surrounding veins compared to arteries may help to maintain low resistance clearance routes for ISF. This is supported by the observation that mice lacking the Aqp4 gene exhibit an enlarged extracellular space in the brain parenchyma compared to wild-type animals (34), which may represent a compensatory phenomenon to counteract the higher resistance toward parenchymal bulk ISF efflux in these mice. Mice with mislocalized or absent perivascular astrocytic AQP4, including a-syntrophin (35), mdx (36), and Aqp4 (37) knockout mice, show swollen endfeet and other pathological changes to perivascular astrocytes. These changes, related to the dysregulation of scaffolding at the perivascular endfoot, might account for the observed effects of Aqp4 gene deletion on interstitial bulk flow and solute clearance. Subsequent electron microscopic studies, however, reported no apparent ultrastructural changes in either the BBB or the perivascular astrocytic endfeet of Aqp4-null mice (38, 39), and the present analysis demonstrated that the paravascular space of Aqp4-null mice was structurally intact through the depth of the cortex (FIGS. 12A-E).",
                                "Although this example demonstrates that interstitial solutes are cleared by AQP4-dependent bulk flow along paravenous pathways, these pathways may not necessarily be the terminal route for solute clearance from the cranium. From previous studies, two routes for such terminal clearance appear most likely. First, the movement of solutes along the microvasculature and large draining veins of the brain provide ready access of solutes to specific transport mechanisms at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A second possibility is that solutes draining along the internal cerebral and caudal rhinal veins to their associated sinuses are cleared to the bloodstream via arachnoid granulations (22-24), providing an exit route for interstitial solutes that do not interact with or have saturated specific transport pathways at the BBB.",
                                "The Paravascular Pathway and Disease",
                                "The finding that disruption of this pathway in Aqp4-null mice resulted in the failure of solute clearance is clinically relevant for neurodegenerative diseases in which the mis-accumulation of neurotoxic depositions contributes to disease development. Ball et al. have reported that intraparenchymally injected A\u03b2 is cleared along paravascular pathways (40), whereas the failure of paravascular soluble A\u03b2 clearance has been suggested to underlie the formation of extracellular A\u03b2 aggregates and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (41). In the present example, fluorescent-tagged soluble A\u03b21-40 injected into the brain parenchyma was cleared along the same paravascular pathways as other fluorescent tracers and the clearance of radiolabeled A\u03b21-40 from the interstitium was substantially reduced in Aqp4-null mice. This is significant because of the association of Alzheimer's disease with reactive gliosis and the increasing gliosis observed in the aging brain (42-44). Altered AQP4 expression and localization in reactive astrocytes under neuropathological conditions (45) may contribute to deranged interstitial bulk flow and a resulting failure in the clearance of neurotoxic solutes such as A\u03b2.",
                                "Soluble A\u03b21-40 was cleared from the brain interstitium more rapidly than a comparably sized dextran molecule, suggesting that interaction between specific BBB A\u03b2 efflux receptors with bulk flow-dependent clearance (46, 47) may occur. The clearance of A\u03b2 along specific anatomical paravascular pathways (including the deep venous system) raises the possibility that transendothelial A\u03b2 efflux may not be uniform throughout the brain vasculature but may occur at certain specialized clearance vessels. Soluble A\u03b2 moving along paravenous clearance pathways reenters the CSF compartment, either within the ventricles (internal cerebral veins) or in the subarachnoid space (caudal rhinal veins). The ventricular pathway provides a direct route to the choroid plexus, a structure that may contribute to A\u03b2 clearance from the CSF compartment (48). A\u03b2 sequestered from the aqueous phase into plaques (primarily A\u03b21-42) would not be cleared by bulk flow either to remote sites of transendothelial or choroidal efflux, or by bulk clearance via the CSF.",
                                "These patterns of parenchymal fluid flow provide routes for a number of therapeutic approaches. First, improving the efficiency of AQP4-dependent bulk flow can permit the improved clearance of soluble A\u03b2, potentially accelerating either its degradation or its re-uptake into the systemic circulation. Conversely, impeding solute clearance can slow the removal of therapeutic agents, such as antineoplastic agents and immune modulators, from the brain. AQP4-dependent bulk flow can also facilitate immune surveillance of the brain parenchyma without compromising CNS immune privilege. Both lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the subarachnoid CSF (49) may detect interstitial antigens delivered to the CSF by paravenous bulk outflow. Indeed, Aqp4-null mice exhibit reduced neuroinflammation after intracerebral lipopolysaccharide injection (50). This attenuation of the peripheral immune response may be a consequence of reduced antigen accumulation in the subarachnoid CSF compartment in Aqp4-null mice. These paravascular routes can also serve as pathways for migrating cells and their guidance molecules, thus representing a potential avenue for tumor cell migration (51). Additionally, paravascular routes can be conduits for cell migration, molecularly distinct and functionally overlapping with the perivascular niches for cell genesis and migration in the adult brain parenchyma (52).",
                                "Although this pathway is important to fluid and solute homeostasis in the rodent brain, it also of great importance for interstitial solute clearance in humans. One of the hallmarks of bulk flow, compared to simple diffusion, is the independence of solute movement from molecular size (4, 46), because all solutes are carried along with the moving medium at the same rate of fluid flow. In contrast, in simple diffusion, because of the dependence of diffusion rates on molecular size, larger solutes require longer times to clear from the brain parenchyma into the nearest CSF compartment (16, 46). Thus, whereas urea (molecular size, 60 daltons) requires 5.4 hours to diffuse 1 cm within the brain, albumin (molecular size, 66.5 kD) would require 109 hours. On the basis of these values, Cserr postulated that the larger the brain, the greater the dependence upon bulk flow for the efficient clearance of interstitial solutes, particularly for larger molecules such as peptides and proteins that cannot effectively clear via diffusion (16). Thus, in the human brain, paravascular pathways and AQP4-dependent bulk flow can be substantially more critical to brain function than in the rodent brain. To evaluate this possibility, less invasive approaches than those used in this example, for assessing interstitial solute movement in humans, such as magnetic resonance perfusion imaging, were used in Example 2.",

                                "The glymphatic system, described above in Example 1, is a brain-wide paravascular pathway for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange that facilitates efficient clearance of solutes and waste from the brain. CSF enters the brain along para-arterial channels to exchange with ISF, which is in turn cleared from the brain along para-venous pathways. Because soluble amyloid \u03b2 clearance depends on glymphatic pathway function, failure of this clearance system may contribute to amyloid plaque deposition and Alzheimer's disease progression. This example demonstrates that glymphatic pathway function can be measured using a clinically relevant imaging technique. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was used to visualize CSF-ISF exchange across the rat brain following intrathecal paramagnetic contrast agent administration. Features of glymphatic pathway function were characterized, including visualization of para-arterial CSF influx and molecular size-dependent CSF-ISF exchange. Whole-brain imaging allowed the identification of two key influx nodes, at the pituitary and pineal gland recesses, while dynamic MRI imaging permitted the definition of kinetic parameters to characterize glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange and solute clearance from the brain. The MRI approach demonstrated in this example can be used in a method for evaluating Alzheimer's disease susceptibility and progression in the live human brain.",
                                "Introduction",
                                "In the classical model, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is actively secreted by the choroid plexus of the cerebral ventricles, travels by bulk or pulsatile flow through the ventricular system, flowing from the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space through the foramina of Luschka and the foramen of Magendie. From the subarachnoid space, CSF is thought to be reabsorbed to the blood stream either via arachnoid granulations of the dural sinuses or by passing out of the cranial cavity along cranial nerve sheathes to be eliminated through the cervical lymphatics (1, 2). Fluid movement along this CSF column is commonly measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the visualization of CSF flow dynamics and is used clinically in the evaluation of communicating versus non-communicating hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus and arachnoid cysts (3). Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance cisternography can also be used to identify CSF leaks in the treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension or CSF rhinorrhea (4, 5).",
                                "Example 1 demonstrates that contrary to the textbook model of CSF secretion and reabsorption, a large proportion of subarachnoid CSF recirculates through the brain parenchyma along paravascular spaces and exchanges with the interstitial fluid (ISF). The flow of fluid along these paravascular routes and through the interstitium is supported by trans-glial water movement through astrocytic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels and facilitates the efficient clearance of interstitial solutes, including soluble amyloid \u03b2, from the brain parenchyma. The description of this pathway in Example 1, termed the \u2018glymphatic\u2019 system, was based upon in vivo 2-photon and ex vivo fluorescence imaging. Analysis of ex vivo brain slices suggested that this pathway represented a brain-wide anatomical system to facilitate the efficient clearance of interstitial solutes and wastes, however the limitations of fluorescence-based imaging modalities prevented the direct assessment of brain-wide CSF-ISF flow dynamics in a three-dimensional (3D) manner.",
                                "In the present study, contrast enhanced MRI was used to visualize brain-wide subarachnoid CSF-ISF exchange in the live rat brain. The characteristics of the pathway described in the initial study (Example 1) were confirmed, including the bulk flow-dependent influx of subarachnoid CSF tracer along para-arterial routes and movement of tracer into and through the brain parenchyma. The inherent 3D nature of MRI was used in combination with various processing modalities including cluster analysis to map the CSF-ISF exchange pathway across the brain over time, to identify anatomical influx \u2018nodes\u2019 and clearance routes from the brain parenchyma. Kinetic parameters were defined that describe the influx and clearance of the paramagnetic contrast agents throughout the brain volume. In light of the key role that this pathway plays in soluble amyloid \u03b2 clearance from the brain parenchyma as demonstrated in Example 1, this contrast-enhanced MRI quantification approach can provide the basis for a wholly new strategy to evaluating Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility and disease progression.",

For anesthesia, the animals were induced with 3% isofluorane in oxygen using an induction chamber and then received an intra-peritoneal injection of 40 mg/kg phenobarbital (Nembutal\u00ae Sodium solution, OVATION, Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Deerfield, Ill., USA). The animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously during the entire experiment. Non-invasive monitors (pulse-oximetry, respiratory rate and rectal temperature probe, SA Instruments, Inc., Stony Brook, N.Y.) were placed to assure adequate oxygenation (O2-saturation>97%), ventilation (respiratory rate 50-65 breath per minute) and normal body temperature (36.5\u00b0 C.-37.5\u00b0 C.) during the surgical procedures. A 24-gauge catheter was inserted into the tail vein for administration of fluids and supplemental anesthesia. The animal was positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, frame #9) and the head flexed to 50 degrees. For the brief surgical procedure, anesthesia was supplemented with isoflurane (0.8-1.2%) delivered in an 1:1 O2:Air mixture.",
                                "The atlanto-occipital membrane was exposed via a midline dorsal neck incision and a small incision was made to expose the underlying dura mater. A polyethylene catheter (6-cm long, 0.28 mm ID\u00d70.61 mm OD, (Solomon Scientific, Plymouth Meeting, Pa.)) filled with normal saline was advanced 1-mm into the intrathecal space via a small durotomy made using a 23-gauge needle and was fixed and sealed with super glue.

The head of the animal was positioned on top of a 3.0 cm custom-made radio-frequency (rf) receiver coil. Non-invasive, MRI compatible monitors (pulse-oximetry, respiratory rate and rectal temperature probe, SA Instruments, Inc., Stony Brook, N.Y.) were repositioned for continuous monitoring of vital signs while the animal underwent MRI imaging. During imaging, body temperature was kept strictly within 36.5-37.5\u00b0 C. during imaging using a computer assisted air heating system (SA Instruments, Inc., Stony Brook, N.Y.). The intrathecal catheter was connected to a long PE 20 line filled with paramagnetic MR contrast diluted in 0.9% NaCl attached to a 1 cc-syringe and microinfusion pump (Baxter Model AS50 infusion Pump, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Illinois, USA). The tail vein catheter was used for maintenance hydration (0.9% NaCl, 4 cc/kg/hr) and supplemental anesthesia (Nembutal\u00ae, 5-10 mg/kg IV) administered every 2 hrs as guided by the respiratory rate.",
                                "Two different paramagnetic contrast agents were used for the experiments: Magnevist\u00ae, (diethylenetriaminepentacetate (Gd-DTPA), Molecular Weight (MW) 938 D, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Wayne, N.J. 07470) and GadoSpin\u2122 P (polymeric Gd-chelate, MW 200 kDa, Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, Calif.). To visualize the glymphatic pathways by contrast-enhanced MRI (T1 shortening effects the initial concentrations were first established at which the two different paramagnetic contrast agents are matched so that decreasing concentrations produced over time in brain tissue far from the injection site were comparable. In other words, the T1 effects induced by the two paramagnetic contrast agents are important to match since after they are injected into the cisterna magna they will travel through the brain-wide glymphatic pathways and become progressively diluted over time. To accomplish this, phantom experiments were carried out.",

A custom-made 3-cm surface radio-frequency coil was used as a receiver and a 16-cm diameter volume coil (Bruker) was used as a transmitter.

For all experiments a 60 mM (1:8 volume ratio diluted in 0.9% NaCl) Gd-DTPA phantom placed in the vicinity of animal's head was used for image intensity normalization over the time series. The scanning protocol consisted of three baseline scans followed by intrathecal paramagnetic contrast (0.17 mM GadoSpin\u2122 and 21 mM Gd-DTPA) delivery via the indwelling catheter while MRI acquisitions continued. A total of 80 \u03bcl of the paramagnetic contrast agent was delivered intrathecally at an infusion rate of 1.6 \u03bcl/min (total infusion time: 50 min). After completion of the intrathecal infusion, the 3D MRI acquisitions continued over 3.9 hrs. At the end of the experiment the animal was euthanized with an overdose of Nembutal.",

SPM8 (World Wide Web at fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) was used for this. First, the acquired T1-weighted MRI images were exported as DICOM files and converted to 3D Nlfti image format. Second, scan to scan misregistration caused by head movement was corrected by rigid-body alignment of each scan to the time-averaged (mean) image. Third, image intensity was normalized over the time-series by dividing voxel intensity by the mean intensity of the reference phantom using the following expression: img_normalized=img_original/phantom*1000; followed by 0.1 mm full width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian smoothing. Finally, all time-series images were subtracted and divided by the baseline average image using the following expression: (P(l,j,k)=(l(l,j,k)-base(l,j,k))/base(l,j,k)*100) to ensure that voxel intensity represents percentage change relative to the average baseline images.",

The T1-weighted averaged baseline images as well as the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs were used to anatomically guide placement of the regions-of-interest (ROIs). From near-midline sagittal MRIs, ROIs were drawn on four sagittal slices in each hemisphere and the signals from each of the anatomical ROIs were averaged using PMOD software (PMOD Version 3.307, PMOD Technologies, Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland). The ROIs included the pituitary recess, pineal recess, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, pontine nucleus and aqueduct. The TACs for each ROI were extracted via the PKMod module. The area under the curve (AUC) for each ROI's TAC was calculated using the \u2018trapezoidal rule\u2019. The calculated AUCs were normalized by dividing each animal's AUC by the number of the corresponding time intervals used for that particular study referred to as \u2018mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC)\u2019 calculated as: (mAUC=AUC/(n\u22121)). Furthermore, to minimize potential differences in the amount of paramagnetic contrast delivered to each animal within groups the mAUC of the pituitary recess (which represent the major input and source of contrast) was used to normalize the other regions mAUCs. Subsequently, the mean mAUC-ratios were compared between the two groups for each anatomical location using a two-sided independent t-test.",

A volume-of-interest mask containing the brain only was created for the cluster analysis. The number of clusters (K) used was determined by the K which was able to segment out voxels adjacent to the large vessels such as basilar artery (including pituitary recess) and olfactory artery complex. This was done on an interactive, per animal basis. Each analysis was performed using a 50% percentile threshold (i.e. only 50% of the pixels with the highest signal changes (sum of squared TAC values were used). The number of clusters which provided the most ideal visualization of para-vascular inflow conduits was 4 clusters. The four clusters were examined visually and co-registered with the corresponding contrast-enhanced and anatomical MRIs to verify the positions of the clusters in relation to the large vessels. The number of voxels and TACs for each cluster was extracted for further processing.",

FITC-d500 and TR-d3 were selected to roughly correspond with the molecular weights of Gd-DTPA (MW \u02dc1 kD) and GadoSpin\u2122 (MW 200 kD). Intrathecal injections were conducted as detailed above. A mixture of 0.1% FITC-d500 and TR-d3 dissolved in artificial CSF was injected. 30, 60 and 180 min post-injection, animals were trans-cardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the brains removed and post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0 C. 100 \u03bcm sagittal vibratome sections were cut and mounted with Prolong Antifade Gold reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).

GadoSpin\u2122 P was prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction; and to reconstitute the lyophilizate, 1 cc sterile 0.9% NaCl was injected into each vial containing 33 mg GadoSpin\u2122 P, yielding a 0.165 mM solution.

The undiluted, reconstituted GadoSpin\u2122 P and 20.8 mM Gd-DTPA represented the initial solutions from which the phantoms of different concentrations were made. Thus, Gd-DTPA phantoms were prepared by serially diluting 20.8 mM Gd-DTPA with sterile 0.9% NaCl to obtain 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1280 volume ratios.

Such an extensive \u2018retrograde\u2019 flux of CSF into the brain parenchyma is contrary to the classical model of CSF secretion and reabsorption (1, 2). In this example, the first goal was to determine whether the paravascular influx of CSF into the brain could be observed by contrast-enhanced MRI following intrathecal delivery of different paramagnetic contrast agents.",

The dynamic time-series of T1-weighted MRIs clearly reveal the time-dependent anatomical routes of paravascular influx including 1) arrival of paramagnetic contrast agent in the cisterna magna (FIGS. 18C and F) and transport along the basilar artery (FIGS. 18D and G), 2) appearance of contrast in the pituitary recess (FIGS. 18D and G), 3) continued transport along the olfactory arterial complex and into the olfactory bulb (FIGS. 18E and H), and 4) transport via the posterior choroidal arterial complex (FIG. 18A) to the pineal recess.",
                                "Movies of the dynamic time series capturing transport through the glymphatic system of Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 clearly demonstrate the difference in brain-wide distribution of the small and larger molecules (data not shown; still images from movies shown in FIGS. 19 and 20). For example, signal-changes induced by GadoSpin\u2122 appear and preferentially remain along the para-arterial/para-vascular conduits and parenchymal uptake is sparse, while the small molecular weight Gd-DTPA contrast agent has much more diffuse access to the brain parenchyma (data not shown). It is also evident that although the molecular weights of the two paramagnetic contrast agents are different, the passage via the para-vascular conduits is largely similar from the time the contrast appears in the cisterna magna (defined as \u20180\u2019 min in FIGS. 18C and F). Some variability exists as to the amount of paramagnetic contrast that appears in the pineal recess; and in 2 animals injected with Gd-DTPA no signal changes were observed in the pineal recess. However, the para-vascular nature of the influx along the glymphatic pathway is clearest at the level of the Circle of Willis, where high intensity signal outlines the exit of the posterior communicating arteries (FIG. 18I); as well as along the lateral orbitofrontal artery (FIG. 18J).",
                                "Based upon the dynamic time-series, it is evident that although Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 differ in molecular weight by more than 2 orders of magnitude, they appear to transit the paravascular conduits at largely similar rates (FIGS. 18C-H). Contrast appeared to move sluggishly through the pineal recess, typically remaining in this cistern even after more than 2 hrs of wash-out (data not shown). The observation that paravascular contrast movement did not appreciably differ based upon agent molecular weight is consistent with bulk flow-mediated fluid transport, which is known to be independent of molecular size (7). These data confirm using contrast-enhanced MRI the first basic finding in Example 1 that bulk flow of CSF from the subarachnoid space into the brain parenchyma occurs primarily along para-arterial pathways.",

                                "In Example 1, it was demonstrated that although both small and large molecular weight tracers were able to move along the proximal para-arterial influx pathway, access from the para-arterial space into the surrounding brain interstitium was restricted based upon molecular size. Specifically, smaller molecular weight tracers such as TR-d3 (MW 3 kD) or ALEXA647-conjugated ovalbumin (MW 45 kD) passed readily into the interstitium while larger molecular weight tracers such as FITC-conjugated 2000 kD dextran (FITC-d2000, MW 2000 kD) remained confined to the paravascular spaces. It was surmised that overlapping astrocytic endfeet which completely ensheathe the cerebral microcirculation (8) function to restrict the access of larger molecular weight substances from the interstitium. Based upon these findings, it was predicted that as a result of better access to the brain interstitium Gd-DTPA (MW 938 Da) would be expected to induce signal changes (T1 shortening) in a larger total brain tissue volume compared to the larger GadoSpin\u2122 (MW 200 kD) molecule. This hypothesis was tested using different quantitative image processing strategies.",
                                "The total \u2018time-exposure\u2019 of paramagnetic contrast was first measured at key anatomical sites near large para-vascular inflow conduits where contrast uptake was clearly visualized over time. Specifically, ROIs were sub-divided into the most proximal glymphatic inflow conduits (i.e., the pituitary recess and pineal recess) and \u2018parenchymal\u2019 ROIs such as the pontine nucleus, cerebellum, olfactory bulb and aqueduct. To compare the relative kinetics within these sub-regions, average TACs for Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 were calculated and plotted in FIGS. 21A-F. Within the pituitary recess, the average time course of signal intensity changes induced by Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 were largely identical over the entire study period (FIG. 21A). Similar findings were observed for the pineal recess (FIG. 21B). This confirms that within the proximal portions of the glymphatic pathway, defined as the subarachnoid spaces and proximal paravascular channels, contrast agent access and flux is largely independent of molecular size. In contrast, the average TACs for Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 within the cerebellum (FIG. 21C), aqueduct (FIG. 21E) and pontine nucleus (FIG. 21F) demonstrated clear intra-agent differences in influx rate, time-to-peak, and efflux rates. In each case, the apparent influx of large molecular weight GadoSpin\u2122 into these regions lagged considerably behind that of Gd-DTPA. For example, in rats infused with Gd-DTPA, the average uptake in the cerebellum peaked at \u02dc90 min post-injection, whereas in rats infused with GadoSpin\u2122, the average cerebellar tissue uptake reached an apparent plateau at \u02dc120 min post-injection.",
                                "Mean AUC values (mAUC), reflecting transit and uptake rates, were also calculated for Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 within each of these regions. At the pituitary recess, mAUC values derived for Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 were 743\u00b1266% signal change per time interval and 685\u00b1217% signal change per time interval, respectively (p-value=0.45). As the total amount of paramagnetic contrast passing through the pituitary recess varied among rats within each group, to minimize variability when comparing tissue uptake of paramagnetic contrast within and between groups, all regional mAUCs were normalized to the mAUC of the pituitary recess (representing the most proximal portion of the glymphatic pathway and main \u2018source\u2019 of contrast delivery). Table 1 shows the results of the regional mAUC ratio analysis and demonstrates that tissue uptake of Gd-DTPA was significantly higher than that of GadoSpin\u2122 in the cerebellum, aqueduct and the pontine nucleus when compared to GadoSpin\u2122",
                                "As a second non-parametric approach to analyze brain tissue uptake and distribution patterns of Gd-DTPA compared to GadoSpin\u2122, a cluster analysis was performed on a series of 4 midline sagittal slices at the level of the aqueduct from each animal. The results of this analysis are shown in FIGS. 22A-J. Four clusters (K=4) were used for optimal visualization of the peri-vascular conduits. The different clusters were associated with different anatomical areas including tissue immediately associated with para-vascular areas (zone 1), tissue immediately adjacent to zone 1 (zone 2) and the most distally labeled voxels next to zone 2 (zone 3). The distribution pattern of the clusters and corresponding zones are shown in FIGS. 22A-J. In the GadoSpin\u2122 rats, the para-vascular zone 1 includes the red and the orange clusters (FIG. 22B) and the green and blue clusters comprise zone 2 and zone 3, respectively, and represents the slower parenchymal glymphatic pathways such as the olfactory bulb and tissue adjacent to the pituitary recess and pineal recess (FIG. 22C, D). The TACs of the four clusters from the GadoSpin\u2122 rat show that the most proximal para-vascular conduits (red and orange clusters) are represented by the highest signal changes (>300% signal change from baseline) when compared to the green and blue clusters; and furthermore that they represent the smallest compartment (FIG. 22I).",
                                "In the Gd-DTPA rats the cluster analysis similarly resulted in clusters distributed among three major anatomical zones, however, it included overall more brain tissue when compared to GadoSpin\u2122. As shown in FIGS. 22A-J, in the Gd-DTPA rat the red clusters are located in para-vascular conduits as observed for GadoSpin\u2122 (compare FIGS. 22B and F); and the green clusters are associated with deeper tissue areas such as the olfactory bulb and cerebellum (FIG. 22G). However, in contrast to GadoSpin\u2122, the blue cluster voxels of the Gd-DTPA rats included most of the cerebellum and pontine nucleus (FIG. 22G-H) suggesting that the large molecular weight GadoSpin\u2122 does not gain access to the brain interstitial space as readily as the small molecular weight Gd-DTPA. The TACs of the four different clusters from the Gd-DTPA rat are shown in FIG. 22J. The time-to-peak of the para-vascular red cluster is \u02dc90 min, which is similar to that observed for the para-vascular red cluster of the GadoSpin\u2122 rat. In other words, para-vascular transport of Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 share similar kinetics.",

As can be seen from Table 2, the number of voxels allocated to zone 1 (para-vascular areas) are within similar range for Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 rats. However, in the Gd-DTPA rats the average total number of voxels in zone 3 (blue voxels in FIG. 22D), is significantly higher than observed for GadoSpin\u2122 (blue voxels in FIG. 22H; P-value <0.05).",
                                "To further compare the relationships between clusters within the two groups, the ratio was calculated of zone 2's total time-weighted cluster number to that of the first (Zone 2#Voxels*AUC/Zone 1#Voxels*AUC) and the ratio of zone 3's total time-weighted cluster number to the first Zone (Zone 3#Voxels*AUC/Zone 1#Voxels*AUC). These ratios represent the relationship between the contrast (Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122) that passes through the paravascular regions (zone 1) and that which passes through parenchymal voxels (zones 2 and 3) over the study period. They represent a way to quantify the relative ease with which contrast agent can transit from the proximal glymphatic influx pathway (red and/or orange clusters) into the deeper brain interstitium (green and blue clusters). As can be seen in Table 2, the average Zone 3#Voxels*AUC/Zone 1#Voxels*AUC ratio obtained in Gd-DTPA rats is significantly higher than that obtained in GadoSpin\u2122 rats (Gd-DTPA: 0.89\u00b10.56 vs. GadoSpin\u2122: 0.25\u00b10.22; p=0.027, t-test). Thus, this non-parametric cluster analysis clearly confirms that while small molecular weight Gd-DTPA and large molecular weight GadoSpin\u2122 enjoy largely equivalent access to the proximal glymphatic pathway (including the subarachnoid and initial paravascular compartments), the access of the large molecular weight GadoSpin\u2122 to the brain interstitial space is dramatically reduced compared to Gd-DTPA.",

                                "The volume of brain parenchyma exhibiting signal changes (T1-shortening) upon intrathecal contrast injection in rats was considerably more restricted than the penetration of fluorescent CSF tracers into the brain parenchyma detected by fluorescence-based imaging in mice (Example 1). This discrepancy stemmed from differences in total amount of contrast delivered intrathecally combined with the relative insensitivity (compared to fluorescence-based imaging) of T1-weighted MRI to detect signal changes induced by low concentrations of contrast agent when dispersed throughout the brain parenchyma. To test this, fluorescent dextrans (FITC-d500 and TR-d3; MW 500 kD and 3 kD, respectively) were co-injected by the same protocol used for the MRI study, and evaluated the routes and extent of tracer penetration into the brain by ex vivo fluorescence microscopy.",
                                "When imaged at low power (4\u00d7) by conventional epifluorescence microscopy, gross fluorescent tracer distribution was in broad agreement with the findings of the MRI imaging study. 30 to 60 min after tracer infusion, intense fluorescence labeling was apparent below the pial surface throughout the brain (FIGS. 23A, F). Tracer intensity was greatest along the ventral brain surface and along the margins of the pineal recess as it extends into the brain and connects with the hippocampal fissure. At these locations, CSF tracer penetration into the tissue was largely dependent upon molecular size, as the small molecular weight TR-d3 readily entered the parenchyma from the subarachnoid space while the large molecular weight FTIC-d500 did not penetrate beyond the pial surface (FIG. 23A, F).",
                                "At 30 min post-injection, paravascular CSF influx into the brain was clearly evident (FIG. 23A-B). As observed in Example 1, paravascular influx occurred almost exclusively along the spaces surrounding penetrating arteries (FIGS. 23C-D) rather than along veins (FIG. 23E). This included smaller penetrating cortical arteries in addition to large caliber arteries originating at the ventral brain surface. Consistent with the differences in distribution observed between Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122, TR-d3 and FITC-d500 distribution through the brain differed markedly. At 30 min post-injection, FITC-d500 remained restricted to the paravascular spaces and did not enter the surrounding parenchyma. In contrast, TR-d3 spread readily from the paravascular spaces into the surrounding parenchyma and was taken up by nearby neurons (FIGS. 23C-D).",
                                "Signal changes induced within the parenchyma by Gd-DTPA peaked between 60-80 min post-injection (FIGS. 21C-D), then declined as contrast was cleared from the brain parenchyma. Between 30 and 60 min post-injection, brain-wide TR-d3 fluorescence appeared to increase as the tracer spread from the proximal pial surface and paravascular pathways to distribute diffusely throughout the parenchyma (FIGS. 23A, F). FITC-d500 remained confined to paravascular spaces, extending into capillary beds throughout the brain (FIG. 23G). At 180 min post-injection, brain fluorescence intensity had declined from values at 30 and 60 min (FIG. 23H), however tracer persisted in the surrounding para-venous pathways near the pineal recess (FIG. 23I).",
                                "Discussion",
                                "Example 1 demonstrated that the glymphatic pathway is a key contributor to the clearance of soluble amyloid \u03b2 from the brain interstitium and proposed that the failure of this clearance might contribute to amyloid plaque deposition and AD progression. In light of these findings, there is great value in the development of a clinical prognostic test for measuring glymphatic pathway function throughout the human brain, and evaluating whether suppression of this system contributes to the development and progression of AD. This example demonstrates that glymphatic pathway function can be measured using a clinically relevant imaging technique, contrast-enhanced MRI, to visualize brain-wide CSF-ISF exchange. It demonstrates that following intrathecal administration, contrast moves rapidly by bulk flow through para-arterial pathways to reach major influx nodes at the pituitary recess, the olfactory bulb and the pineal recess. Furthermore, parametric and non-parametric data analysis of signal changes (T1 shortening) within different regions of the brain parenchyma clearly demonstrates that contrast movement into and through the interstitium is highly dependent upon the molecular weight of the paramagnetic contrast molecule. From the dynamic series of contrast-enhanced MRI images, kinetic parameters were developed and defined to characterize glymphatic system function that reflect rates of CSF-ISF exchange throughout the brain.",
                                "Example 1 demonstrated that subarachnoid CSF rapidly enters the brain parenchyma along paravascular channels surrounding penetrating arteries. The present findings demonstrate that external brain surface arteries such as the basilar artery, communicating arteries of the Circle of Willis and olfactory arteries constitute a rapid transport pathway for CSF within the wider subarachnoid space and ultimately the brain proper. Anatomically, these CSF transport pathways likely correspond to the leptomeningeal paravascular sheathes described in electron microscopy studies by Weller and colleagues (9-11). Both small (<1 kD) and large (\u02dc200 kD) molecular weight contrast moved through these para-arterial spaces at comparable rates, suggesting that bulk flow is driving CSF flux transport along these pathways (7, 12, 13). Analysis of intrathecal fluorescently labeled tracer influx into the rat brain confirmed that the bulk flow pathways surrounding the surface arteries are continuous with those surrounding smaller penetrating arteries and provide a direct route for the rapid influx of CSF into and through the brain interstitium. These para-arterial bulk flow pathways comprise the major component of a brain-wide system that facilitates that clearance of solutes and wastes from the brain interstitium.",
                                "The exchange of CSF and ISF between paravascular spaces and the interstitium occurs across perivascular astrocytic endfeet, which extend nearly complete coverage over the brain microvasculature (8). As a result, solutes that lack a specific molecular transport pathway (such as ion transporters or channels) across the endfeet must instead pass through the \u02dc20 nm cleft between overlapping endfoot processes to gain access to the interstitial space. In Example 1, small tracers such as TR-d3 (diameter of hydration (dH)=6. 1 nm (14)) were observed to pass readily into and through the interstitium, whereas large tracers such as FITC-d2000 (dH>32 nm (14)) remained largely confined to paravascular spaces. In this example, these findings were confirmed in the rat using fluorescence-based imaging. In addition, intrathecal administration of two different sized contrast agents, Gd-DTPA (MW \u02dc1 kD) and GadoSpin\u2122 (MW 200 kD), was used to demonstrate a similar effect of tracer size by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. For example, when TACs for the two contrast agents are compared at different anatomical locations, the large molecular weight GadoSpin\u2122 entered the brain parenchyma at a dramatically lower rate than did the small molecular weight Gd-DTPA (compare red and blue curves, FIGS. 21A-F). Moreover, an independent cluster analysis clearly revealed that while both tracers had ready access to paravascular spaces, the brain volume accessible to Gd-DTPA was markedly larger than that accessed by GadoSpin\u2122 (compare blue Zone 3, FIGS. 22D, H). Although the observed differences in CSF-ISF exchange patterns between Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 can be attributed to differences in molecular size, other possibilities exist. For example, other intrinsic molecular properties such as shape, electrostatic forces, size (radius of gyration), conformation or physical/chemical interactions may contribute to the dissimilar CSF-ISF exchange patterns observed with the two contrast molecules.",
                                "One apparent discrepancy between fluorescence-based and contrast enhanced MR-based imaging under the experimental protocol in this example is the inability to detect the small molecular weight contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) in the entire brain parenchyma after intrathecal injection. This is in contrast to the widespread parenchymal labeling with small molecular weight fluorescent CSF tracers in the mouse (Example 1). To confirm that these differences did not reflect species differences in CSF-ISF exchange, ex vivo fluorescence imaging in rat brain slices was conducted following intrathecal injection of similarly-sized fluorescent CSF tracers (compare FITC-d500 (500 kD) to GadoSpin\u2122 (200 kD), and TR-d3 (MW 3 kD) to Gd-DTPA (MW \u02dc1 kD)) using an injection protocol that was otherwise identical to that used for the MRI experiments. This fluorescence-based imaging confirmed the permeation of small molecular weight CSF tracer throughout the rat brain parenchyma, and restriction of the large molecular weight tracer to the paravascular spaces. Thus Gd-DTPA, like TR-d3, does in fact move throughout the brain parenchyma. However, the Gd-DTPA contrast concentrations achieved under the current intrathecal infusion protocol within the broader parenchyma simply were not sufficiently high to induce detectable signal changes (T1 shortening).",
                                "Notwithstanding these limitations, the intrinsic 3D nature of MRI permitted the visualization of the entire paravascular CSF-ISF exchange pathway throughout the whole brain, allowing us to define key nodes of CSF influx into the brain at the pituitary recess, olfactory artery, and pineal recess and to assess CSF-ISF exchange at many anatomically distinct locations simultaneously (FIG. 24). Through the dynamic image acquisitions, the kinetics of CSF tracer influx into and clearance from the paravascular and interstitial spaces could be measured and characterized for a given contrast molecule. For example, TACs generated for the subarachnoid pituitary recess and pineal recess after Gd-DTPA injection exhibit similar influx profiles whereas efflux from the pineal recess is markedly slowed compared to that of the pituitary recess (compare FIGS. 21A and B). Similarly, TACs generated for the cerebellum and aqueduct show similar influx kinetics, while the clearance of contrast from the aqueduct is prolonged compared to the cerebellar region (compare FIGS. 21C and E). One possible explanation for the protracted clearance from the pineal recess and the aqueduct is that these anatomical regions constitute primary ISF clearance sites, and thus appear to retain contrast (by accumulating it from other regions) for longer durations.",
                                "Analysis of the dynamic time series data also allowed the essential comparison of CSF-ISF exchange between a small (Gd-DTPA) and a large (GadoSpin\u2122) molecular weight contrast agents. Here it is particularly important to note that within the pituitary recess, Gd-DTPA and GadoSpin\u2122 influx and clearance are virtually identical (compare red and blue curves, FIG. 21A), whereas in the parenchymal pontine nucleus, GadoSpin\u2122 movement into and through the region is dramatically reduced compared to Gd-DTPA (compare red and blue curves, FIG. 21F). Using a second approach, cluster analysis, the spatial distribution pattern of CSF-ISF exchange between the two contrast agents can be evaluated at the level of the aqueduct. Comparing either the raw brain volume occupied by Zone 3 (corresponding to the most distal compartment), or the normalized average Zone 3#Voxels*AUC/Zone 1#Voxels*AUC ratio (which reflects tracer penetration from the paravascular space into the brain parenchyma), GadoSpin\u2122 penetration into and through the brain interstitium is dramatically restricted compared to Gd-DTPA (Table 2). Thus, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI following intrathecal contrast agent administration provides an approach to characterizing both the kinetics and spatial distribution of glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange throughout the whole brain.",
                                "Example 1 demonstrates glymphatic pathway is an important contributor to the clearance of interstitial solutes such as soluble amyloid \u03b2, a peptide widely believed to be a critical driver of AD pathogenesis (15, 16). Example 1 indicates that failure of glymphatic pathway function may contribute to the deposition of amyloid \u03b2 plaques and the progression of AD. The work discussed in this example, evaluating glymphatic pathway function by contrast-enhanced MRI in rats, provides the experimental groundwork for evaluating glymphatic pathway function in the human brain and whether its failure contributes to AD progression in man. To accomplish this, a safe, minimally invasive imaging approach to measuring glymphatic pathway function was necessary.",
                                "Contrast-enhanced MR cisternography is currently used clinically to visualize CSF leaks in patients undergoing treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension and CSF rhinorrhea (4, 5) and the Gd-DTPA utilized in the present study is already clinically approved for this purpose. While the current injection route via the cisterna magna and scan time required (>2 hrs) is not clinically relevant, Example 3 demonstrates the suitability of single-shot intrathecal lumbar injections for evaluating glymphatic pathway function in the brain.",
                                "The present example demonstrates that in the rat, this potentially clinically acceptable approach can be used to visualize and evaluate glymphatic pathway function, permitting assessment of kinetics and anatomical distribution patterns of paravascular CSF-ISF exchange throughout the whole brain. This approach can provide the basis for a wholly new prognostic strategy for evaluating AD susceptibility and disease progression.",

                                "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with the aggregation of endogenous peptides and proteins that are thought to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and loss. As demonstrated in Examples 1 and 2 above, the glymphatic system is a key contributor to the clearance of interstitial solutes from the brain, including amyloid \u03b2. These findings suggest that measuring changes in glymphatic pathway function may be an important prognostic for evaluating neurodegenerative disease susceptibility or progression. However, no clinically acceptable approach to evaluate glymphatic pathway function in humans has yet been developed.",
                                "Time sequenced ex vivo fluorescence microscopy of coronal rat and mouse slices was performed at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, following intrathecal injection of Texas Red-conjugated dextran-3 (TR-d3, MW 3 kD) and FITC-conjugated dextran-500 (FITC-d500, MW 500 kD) into the foramen magnum or lumbar spine. Tracer content in different brain regions (cortex, white matter, subcortical structures, and hippocampus) were then quantified in the anterior and posterior rat brain to map the movement of tracer following both injection routes.",
                                "Following both intracisternal and lumbar intrathecal injections, small molecular weight TR-d3 entered the brain along perivascular pathways and exchanged broadly with the brain parenchyma, consistent with the initial characterization of the glymphatic pathway in mice. Larger molecular weight FITC-d500 remained largely confined to the perivascular space. Lumbar intrathecal injections exhibited a reduced and delayed peak fluorescence intensity compared to intracisternal injections.",
                                "Background",
                                "Fatal neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by progressive loss of neurons, sensory and motor impairments, and severe cognitive decline. Extracellular depositions of soluble amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002, Small and Duff, 2008, Maccioni et al., 2010), while analogous misfolded proteins aggregate in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Bruijn et al., 1998, Scherzinger et al., 1999, Ross and Poirier, 2004). In the case of AD, it is widely believed that Amyloid deposition results from an age-related failure of soluble A\u03b2 clearance from the brain (Deane and Zlokovic, 2007). Although neuroimaging approaches are now widely available to detect the deposition of amyloid plaques and the evolution of plaque burden (Nordberg et al., 2010), no approach yet exists that allows the efficiency of A\u03b2 clearance to be directly measured. The ability to detect changes in the efficiency of A\u03b2 clearance would be a significant advance in evaluating susceptibility to and progression of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",
                                "Example 1 demonstrated that a large portion of subarachnoid CSF recirculates through the brain parenchyma along paravascular spaces, exchanging with brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of the brain parenchyma before being cleared via para-venous pathways. The continuous circulation of CSF along this pathway facilitates the clearance of extracellular solutes, including soluble A\u03b2, from the brain. This brain-wide pathway has been termed the \u2018glymphatic system\u2019, based upon the critical role that astroglial water transport through the astrocytic aquaporin-4 water channel plays in facilitating CSF-ISF exchange and solute clearance (Example 1). One implication of these findings is that changes in glymphatic pathway function may contribute to the failure of A\u03b2 clearance in the pre-clinical stages of AD, while a method to measure glymphatic pathway function in clinical populations might allow AD disease susceptibility and progression to be evaluated.",
                                "Initial characterization of the glymphatic system utilized in vivo two-photon microscopy and ex vivo fluorescence imaging of intracisternally injected CSF tracers to map the brain-wide pathway and to quantify the efficiency of solute clearance in mice. These approaches are not appropriate for clinical application, given the optical limitations of fluorescence-based imaging and the complications that are associated with intracisternal injections in humans (Keane, 1973). In the clinical setting, dynamic nuclear imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are routinely used to monitor CSF flux in the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and post-traumatic CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea (Burns, 2008, Daele et al., 2011). These imaging modalities permit time-sequenced three-dimensional (3D) representation of the brain with high spatial and temporal resolution of tracer distribution. In Example 2, a follow-up pre-clinical study, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was successfully utilized after intrathecal injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent into the cisterna magna to measure glymphatic pathway function in rats.",
                                "In contrast to intracisternal injections, lumbar intrathecal injections of radio-tracer are presently used along with computer-tomography/myelography and digital subtraction myelography to diagnose dural leaks associated with SIH, pseudomeningocele, and superficial siderosis (Phillips et al., 2002, Hoxworth et al., 2012), as well as the integrity of the spinal cord in the setting of injury or tumor (Kapila, 1987, Adams et al., 1988). Lumbar intrathecal injections are additionally used in everyday practice for the delivery of anesthetics (Popping et al., 2012), and would thus provide an ideal delivery route for contrast agents that could then be used in conjunction with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to evaluate glymphatic clearance in humans. The present pre-clinical study evaluates whether lumbar intrathecal CSF tracer delivery permits the evaluation of glymphatic pathway function in the brain. The influx kinetics and parenchymal distribution of intracisternally and lumbar intrathecally injected fluorescent tracers in the rat brain are compared. The data demonstrate that CSF tracer injected via both routes enters the brain through paravascular spaces and exchanges with the parenchyma in a manner consistent with the previous characterization of the glymphatic pathway in mice in Example 1. This shows that the lumbar intrathecal injection is a clinically viable contrast delivery route to assess glymphatic function in humans.",

All experiments were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources of the University of Rochester and carried out according to guidelines from the National Institutes of Health. Rats were initially induced with isofluorane (3%), then anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.). Supplemental sodium pentobarbital was given as necessary. For intracisternal injections, anesthetized rats were fixed in a stereotaxic frame, the foramen magnum was surgically exposed, and a 30GA needle was inserted into the cistern magna. For lumbar injections, the lumbar spinal column was exposed, an L2-3 laminectomy was performed, and 30GA needle was inserted into the subarachnoid space.",

Tracers were constituted in artificial CSF at a concentration of 0.25%. For intracisternal and lumbar injection, tracers were infused at a rate of 1.6 \u03bcl/min for the 30 min injection groups, while injection was stopped at a total volume of 70 \u03bcl for injection times greater than or equal to 60 min. At t=30, 60, or 120 min after the start of injection, rats were transcardially perfused with ice-cold heparinized PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).

For intracisternal injection, 8 slices from each animal from the 60 min time point were used. For lumbar injection, 8 slices from each animal from the 120 min time point were used. These time points were chosen because they corresponded with peak CSF tracer influx via the respective injection routes. Slices were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1.5 hrs at room temperature, incubated in mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocytic marker; 1:1000, Millipore) or Biotinylated Griffonia (Brandeiraea) Simplicifolia Lectin I Isolectin B4 (Ib4, a vascular endothelial marker; 1:100, Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4\u00b0 C.

This included separate DAPI, green (for FITC) and red (for Texas Red) emission channels. The gain and exposure settings were determined based on un-injected control slices and held constant throughout all imaging sessions. Slice fluorescence (fluorescent tracer accumulation) in the slices was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH) as described in Example 1. Anatomical brain regions of interest (ROIs) were generated based upon the DAPI emission channel for the cortex, white matter (including corpus callosum, internal and external capsule), subcortical structures (striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus) and hippocampus. The background fluorescence for each channel was uniformly subtracted and the mean pixel intensity for each region was measured. Distribution of large and small molecular weight CSF tracers throughout the brain parenchyma was evaluated under high power by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus).

                                "In the mouse study in Example 1, 2-photon in vivo imaging was used to demonstrate the existence of a brain-wide paravascular route that permits CSF to exchange with the ISF of the brain parenchyma termed the \u2018glymphatic\u2019 system. CSF-ISF exchange along these paravascular pathways was supported by astroglial aquaporin-4 water channels and the movement of fluid through this pathway facilitated the clearance of interstitial solutes, including soluble A\u03b2, from the brain. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether glymphatic pathway function could be similarly evaluated after lumbar intrathecal injection of fluorescent CSF tracers. In contrast to Example 1, which was performed on mice, the current study characterized glymphatic flow in the adult Sprague Dawley rat. This choice to characterize glymphatic flux in rat expands the understanding of glymphatic function into a rodent model recognized in the art as a pre-clinical model for human methods of treatment, while also moving to a model that makes it easier to perform lumbar intrathecal injections. Intracisternal CSF tracer injections were carried out in parallel to provide a direct comparison to the injection route used previously (Example 1). Imaging CSF-ISF exchange in mouse and rat by intracisternal tracer injection",
                                "The movement of intrathecal CSF fluorescent tracer (TR-d3, MW 3 kD) into the rat brain parenchyma after Cisterna Magana injection was characterized. In FIGS. 25A-H, intracisternal CSF tracer influx and clearance were evaluated in mouse and rat. Representative anterior (FIGS. 25A-B) and posterior (FIGS. 25C-D) coronal slices are shown from mouse (FIGS. 25A, C) and rat (FIGS. 25B, D) brains following intracisternal injection of Texas Red-conjugated dextran (TR-d3, MW 3 kD; t=30 min post-injection) showed similar tracer distributions between species. (FIGS. 25E-H) Tissue fluorescence was evaluated in different brain regions: cortex (blue), white matter (grey), hippocampus (magenta), and subcortical structures (red) of the anterior (FIGS. 25E-F) and posterior (FIGS. 25G-H) brain. FIGS. 25F and H show quantification of mean fluorescence intensity within each region (*P<0.05 cortex vs. subcortical structures; ##P<0.01 vs. cortex; 2-way ANOVA; n=3-4 per time point).",
                                "FIGS. 25A-D shows representative images from mouse and rat brain slices, respectively taken 1.1 and 1.0 mm anterior and 1.5 and 0.4 mm posterior to the Bregma 0 point, that were fixed 30 min after injection (the time point of peak fluorescence intensity). Consistent with the prior study in mice (Example 1), intracisternally-injected TR-d3 was observed to move rapidly into the rat brain parenchyma, both across the pial surface and along paravascular pathways (FIGS. 25B, D) and exchanged broadly with the brain interstitium. To quantify tracer movement into different brain regions four anterior (FIGS. 25E-F) and posterior (FIGS. 25G-H) regions of interest were defined including the cortex, white matter, subcortical structures, and hippocampus (FIGS. 25E, G show the regions of interest). Analysis of TR-d3 fluorescence either within the whole ex vivo slice or within the cortex, white matter, or sub-cortical structures revealed that the influx of intracisternally-injected CSF tracer peaked around 30 min post-injection, then began to decline at later time points as the tracer was cleared from the brain tissue (FIG. 25F, H; n=3-4 animals per time point).",
                                "Analysis of tracer clearance between the four different anatomical regions suggested that tracer clearance from subcortical structures was faster than from the cortex (FIGS. 25F, H; *P<0.05 cortex vs. subcortical, 2-way ANOVA). This is consistent with the prior observation that subcortical regions enjoy the largest influxes of subarachnoid CSF along large caliber penetrating arteries from the ventral brain surface (Example 1). Furthermore, these regions are most proximate to the para-venous clearance pathways that drain medially along the internal cerebral veins. When anterior versus posterior tracer fluxes were compared, both peak values at 30 min and the rate of clearance between 30-120 min post-injection were lower in the posterior brain compared to the anterior brain (compare FIGS. 25F, H). These observations are consistent with MRI findings in the rat in which glymphatic fluxes along anterior penetrating arteries were both faster and greater in magnitude than those that followed branches of mediolateral arteries such as the middle cerebral artery (Example 2). In both the anterior and posterior brain, TR-d3 fluorescence intensity in the white matter was significantly lower than the cortex at all time points (FIGS. 25F, H; ##P<0.01 vs. cortex, 2-way ANOVA), while the rate of tracer clearance from the white matter did not appear to consistently differ from other brain regions. The shift in white matter fluorescence intensity likely stems from lower levels of tissue autofluorescence of white matter compared to gray matter. Alternatively, this may reflect the lower levels of CSF tracer penetration into the subcortical white matter observed in the prior study (Example 1).",

FITC-d500 is largely confined to paravascular spaces (FIG. 26B, arrows), while TR-d3 moves readily though the brain parenchyma from paravascular spaces (FIG. 26A, arrows) or from the pial surface (arrowheads). FIGS. 26C-F show quantification of fluorescent tracer influx into anterior (FIGS. 26C-D) and posterior (FIGS. 26E-F) brain after lumbar intrathecal injection, anatomically subdivided into cortex, white matter, subcortical structures, and hippocampus.

                                "Compared to intracisternally-injected TR-d3 (FIGS. 25F, H), the influx of CSF tracer delivered by the lumbar route was significantly delayed, peaking in the posterior brain 60 min after injection, and in the anterior brain 120 min after injection (compare FIGS. 25F, H to FIGS. 26C, E). This delay in CSF tracer influx kinetics was likely attributable to two factors. First, the distance from the site of lumbar injection to the cisterna magna was \u02dc32 mm. Second, the prevailing direction of CSF bulk flow within the spinal subarachnoid was rostral-to-caudal (Enzmann and Pelc, 1991), suggesting that during infusion, CSF tracer must traverse the intervening distance against the bulk CSF flow generated from CSF secretion in the cerebral ventricles. In addition to the delay in fluorescent CSF tracer influx, the overall magnitude of tracer influx into the brain was markedly reduced after lumbar infusion compared to intracisternal infusion. This difference was most likely the result of CSF reabsorption that occurs along the spinal column via the peripheral nerve roots (Edsbagge et al., 2004). As CSF tracer is infused into the lumbar subarachnoid space and moves rostrally towards the brain, a portion will be lost along each vertebral segment along the natural CSF clearance pathway, resulting in a reduced delivery of tracer to the distant cisternal spaces surrounding the brain which form the entrance to the brain-wide glymphatic system (Examples 1 and 2). Despite these differences in influx magnitude and kinetics, tracer distribution after lumbar and intracisternal injection followed a similar pattern and encompassed the entire brain parenchyma (compare FIGS. 25B, D and FIG. 26A). These findings demonstrate that fluorescent intrathecal tracer influx into and through the brain parenchyma can be readily visualized after injection via a lumbar route.",

Because under bulk flow, the movement of the solvent is typically more rapid than the movement of the solute by passive diffusion, bulk flow-dependent movement is largely independent of molecular weight (Cserr, 1971). To evaluate whether the rate of intrathecal lumbar tracer influx into the brain parenchyma was dependent upon molecular size, large molecular weight fluorescent FITC-d500 (MW 500 kD) and small molecular weight TR-d3 (MW 3 kD) were co-injected. Representative images from this study are shown in FIGS. 26A-B. When FITC-d500 and TR-d3 movement into the brain parenchyma were quantified within the anterior and posterior cortex, white matter, subcortical structures and hippocampus, no significant differences were observed between either the time course or the magnitude of influx of the small and large molecular weight tracers (FIGS. 26C-F). This finding is consistent with the movement of fluorescent tracer from the lumbar site of injection to the brain subarachnoid and paravascular spaces via bulk flow rather than by simple diffusion (Cserr, 1971).",

                                "In the prior study in mice (Example 1), it was noted that while CSF tracers of all sizes moved rapidly into the brain along paravascular spaces, large molecular weight tracers such as FITC-d2000 (MW 2000 kD) became trapped in the paravascular space and could not move freely into and through the brain interstitium. According to one recent study, astrocytic endfoot processes completely cover the cerebral microcirculation; the only routes between the paravascular spaces and the wider brain interstitium being through \u02dc20 nm clefts between overlapping astroglial endfeet (Mathiisen et al., 2010). It was surmised that the perivascular astrocytic endfeet acted as a sieve to restrict the movement of large solutes from the paravascular spaces into the brain interstitium (Example 1).",
                                "In the present example, confocal microscopy was utilized to evaluate small (TR-d3) and large (FITC-d500) fluorescent CSF tracer exchange between the paravascular influx pathway and the surrounding brain interstitium. Slices from intracisternally-injected animals and lumbar-injected animals were fixed at 30 and 120 min after injection, respectively. These time points corresponded to the peak influx values observed for each injection route (FIGS. 26A-F and 27A-L).",
                                "FIGS. 27A-L demonstrate CSF tracer localization after intracisternal and lumbar intrathecal injection. FIGS. 27A-L show localization of FITC-conjugated dextran (FITC-d500, MW 500 kD) and Texas Red-conjugated dextran (TR-d3, MW 3 kD) 30 min after intracisternal injection. Large molecular weight FITC-d500 remained restricted to paravascular spaces (arrows) surrounding penetrating arteries (FIGS. 27A-B) and extending to the level of the terminal capillary beds (FIGS. 27C-F, arrows). Small molecular weight TR-d3 moved quickly into the brain interstitium and was taken up by subpopulations of neurons (arrowheads). FIGS. 27G-L show that 120 min after lumbar intrathecal injection of tracers, large molecular weight FITC-d500 accumulated in perivascular spaces (arrows), but not as uniformly as observed after intracisternal injection. Small molecular weight TR-d3 moved readily throughout the brain parenchyma. GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein (astrocytic marker); IB4: isolectin B4 (vascular endothelial marker).",
                                "Following intracisternal injection, FITC-d500 covered the pial surface and distributed into deeper brain tissue along paravascular pathways, extending to the level of the terminal capillary beds (FIGS. 27A-F). It did not move appreciably from the paravascular spaces into the surrounding interstitium. When FITC-d500 distribution was evaluated after lumbar injection, the large molecular weight tracer in a similar manner remained confined to paravascular spaces (FIGS. 27G-L), however the overall fluorescence intensity was reduced compared to intracisternal injections. After both intracisternal and lumbar injection, small molecular weight tracer moved readily into the interstitium surrounding paravascular spaces (FIGS. 27A-L). These data demonstrate that after both intracisternal and lumbar intrathecal injection in the rat, large molecular weight fluorescent tracers move into the brain along paravascular spaces, but remain confined to this space. Small molecular weight CSF tracers, in contrast, are able to move into and through the brain interstitium.",

                                "This pre-clinical study demonstrates three findings.",
                                "First, when glymphatic paravascular CSF-ISF exchange is evaluated after fluorescent CSF tracer injection into the rat cisterna magna, tracer distribution and kinetics within the brain are in general agreement with the initial characterization of this paravascular pathway in the mouse (Example 1).",
                                "Second, it was observed that CSF-ISF exchange within the brain can be readily evaluated after injection of fluorescent CSF tracer via a lumbar, in addition to the intracisternal route.",
                                "Third, it was found that after lumbar intrathecal infusion, fluorescent CSF tracer movement along paravascular pathways is dependent upon bulk flow, whereas fluorescent tracer movement from these paravascular spaces into and through the surrounding brain interstitium is constrained by tracer size.",
                                "Example 1 describes a brain-wide paravascular pathway along which CSF and ISF exchange to facilitate the clearance of interstitial solutes, including amyloid \u03b2, from the brain. These present findings suggest that the failure of amyloid \u03b2 clearance by the glymphatic pathway contributes to the onset of amyloid plaque deposition and AD progression. If true, the ability to clinically measure glymphatic pathway function in patients will provide an effective approach to evaluate AD susceptibility and progression.",
                                "To translate the initial characterization of the glymphatic pathway to a clinical setting, a clinically relevant imaging modality for evaluation of glymphatic pathway function can be used. The analysis in Example 2 demonstrates that the glymphatic system can be evaluated in the rats using contrast-enhanced MRI following intracisternal gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, intracisternal injections are rarely used in a clinical setting due to their high potential for iatrogenic complications, including traumatic tissue injury (Keane, 1973). In contrast, the lumbar intrathecal delivery route is routinely employed for administration of radio-tracers for CT-myelography (Adams et al., 1988, Hoxworth et al., 2012), spinal anesthetics and post-operative analgesics (Hong and Lee, 2005, Gehling and Tryba, 2009), as well as chemotherapeutics (Kerr et al., 2001). In this example, it has been demonstrated glymphatic pathway function can be effectively evaluated using tracer injection via this clinically relevant pathway.",

                                "Normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and the flow associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange removes waste byproducts of metabolism and toxins from the brain. This example relates to restoring or augmenting reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and/or reduced flow associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange in the aging brain. To accomplish this, a mechanical pumping system was used to promote faster clearance.",
                                "In human patients, CSF infusion is carried out, for example, via the lateral ventricle or the subarachnoid space. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is major application for this approach. Currently, there is no treatment that will slow or stop the progression of this devastating disease.",
                                "Background",
                                "Accumulation of toxic dysfunctional proteins in the mammalian brain is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans. However, the mechanism that leads to the accumulation of toxins in the aging brain is not completely known. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the two hallmarks are senile plaques, which are extracellular deposits of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) toxins, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau). The \u201camyloid cascade\u201d hypothesis suggests that the cognitive decline and the distinct pathogenic features in AD are related to abnormal accumulation of these toxins (Selkoe, 2001; Hardy, 2006).",
                                "A\u03b2 is produced by many cells in the body, including nerve cells in the brain, from a large protein called amyloid \u03b2 precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by proteases, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase, to produce A\u03b2 (Selkoe, 2001). In normal individuals, these toxins are present at low concentrations in the brain, but in AD they accumulate and their presence is a major event initiating AD pathogenesis (Hardy & Selkoe, 2002). In a small number of cases (<1%), A\u03b2 accumulation is due to its overproduction (early onset AD), while in the majority of cases, A\u03b2 accumulation is due to faulty clearance from the brain (late on-set AD) (Tanzi, 2005; Tanzi et al., 2004; Mawuenyega et al., 2010). Increased levels of A\u03b2 in the brain results in formation of neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers and progressive synaptic, neuritic and neuronal dysfunction (Masters and Selkoe, 2012). A\u03b2 peptides are the main constituent of amyloid \u03b2 in the brain parenchyma and in the vasculature (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). A\u03b2 extracted from senile plaques is mainly peptides A\u03b21-40 (A\u03b240) and A\u03b21-42 (A\u03b242) while vascular amyloid is mainly peptides A\u03b21-39 and A\u03b240. The major soluble form of A\u03b2 present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain is A\u03b240. Soluble A\u03b2, which is circulating in CSF and brain interstitial fluid (ISF), may exist as free peptide and/or associated with different binding proteins (carriers), such as apolipoprotein E (apoE), apolipoprotein J (apoJ), transthyretin, albumin, and a2-macroglobulin (\u03b12M) (Deane et al., 2009). Therapies based only on lowering brain A\u03b2 levels have, so far, been unsuccessful in clinical trials (Hardy, 2009).",
                                "A\u03b2 is eliminated from brain ISF through various routes, including cellular uptake and degradation, ISF bulk flow, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-mediated transport (Deane et al., 2009). The glymphatic system\u2014a macroscopic brain-wide path of CSF/ISF exchange\u2014facilitates clearance of neurotoxic metabolic by-products, including A\u03b2. The glymphatic system regulates convective flow of brain ISF and functions similarly to the peripheral lymphatic system. The glymphatic system comprises three main pathways: (1) CSF via the peri-arterial space, (2) astrocytic aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-dependent convective flow of brain ISF through the brain parenchyma, and (3) efflux via peri-venous clearance. However, since the CSF rapidly and specifically enters the brain parenchyma along penetrating arteries, the glymphatic system may also act as a distribution path for brain-wide delivery of essential compounds as well as removing toxic compounds. Also, the glymphatic system may be a mechanism that clears the brain of all forms of A\u03b2, bound and free.",
                                "In the aging brain and in AD, CSF secretion is reduced (Serot et al., 2003). Reduced CSF secretion is associated with accumulation of A\u03b2 and tau in rodent brains (Chiu et al., 2012; Silverberg et al., 2010). Continuous drainage of CSF via a shunt, in mild to severe AD patients, had no benefits (Silverberg et al., 2008).",
                                "This example demonstrates that restoring or augmenting the flow of CSF and the CSF/ISF exchange via the glymphatic system and using a mechanical pump or infusion system increases, augments or restores the removal of toxic substances from brain and thus, may prevent loss of neuronal function in the aging brain. This system can also restore the delivery of essential substances to brain. Since the glymphatic system is a fundamental brain-wide system, it has applications to many diseases associated with accumulation of toxic substances in brain.",
                                "In this example, artificial CSF was infused using a mechanical infusion system into the cisterna magna at a low rate (0.1 pUmin) and the recovery of exogenous 125I-A\u03b2 and 14C-inulin at different time-points (15, 30 and 60 min) was measured after their injection into the brain and prior to the CSF infusion. 125I-A\u03b2 was used because A\u03b2 represented a peptide associated with AD and 14C-inulin was used because inulin is an inert molecule and a marker of bulk flow of molecules.",
                                "In a second series of experiments, the rate of CSF infusion was varied (0.1 \u03bcL/min, 0.5 \u03bcL/min and 1.0 \u03bcL/min) and recovery of 125I-A\u03b2 and 14C-inulin was determined 30 min after their injection into the brain. To show that the glymphatic system is a brain-wide process, 125I-A\u03b2 and 14C-inulin were injected into two brain regions, the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex. The normal rate of CSF secretion in mice is 0.37 \u03bcL/min (Oshio et al., 2003). The data obtained demonstrates that restoring or augmenting the flow of CSF and the CSF/ISF exchange via the glymphatic system restores the removal of toxic substances from brain and suggests that loss of neuronal function in the aging brain can be delayed, reduced, decreased or prevented by increasing the flow of CSF and CSF/ISF exchange via the glymphatic system.",

For the caudate-putamen, the coordinate of the cannula tip was 0.9 mm anterior and 1.9 mm lateral to the bregma, and 2.9 mm below the surface of the brain. For the frontal cortex, the coordinate of the cannula tip was 0.7 mm anterior and 3.0 mm lateral to the bregma, and 1.3 mm below the surface of the brain. Animals were allowed to recover after surgery. The experiments were performed before substantial chronic process occurred, but allowing time for the BBB repair to large molecules, as reported (Deane et al., 2004).",

CSF infusion increased clearance of A\u03b2 and inulin from brain. Therefore, infusion of CSF into the CSF compartment can be used to ameliorate, increase or restore the clearance of toxic substances from the aging brain. Since CSF secretion rate is reduced in aging brains and in the brains of individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease, restoring this flow and CSF/ISF exchange can be used to reduce the accumulation of A\u03b2 and delay the onset of, decrease or prevent cognitive decline and/or neuronal dysfunction. This approach can potentially be applied to any age-dependent neurological disorder.",

                                "Sprague Dawley rats (2-3 month old females) were anesthetized with phenobarbital and lumbar intrathecal catheters placed. Imaging was performed using a custom-built, MRI-compatible PET scanner for the rat brain in combination with a 9.4T microMRI (ref). The PET camera used inside the 9.4 TmicroMRI instrument has been described in detail elsewhere (Refs). Briefly, it is a modification of the initial RatCap detector (ref) and designed with non-magnetic materials (ref). The PET ring (ID 38 mm and accommodating the head of a rat) consists of 12 detector blocks consisting of a 4\u00d78 array of 2.22\u00d72.22\u00d75 mm3 lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals assembled with a thin reflective foil and coupled to a matching non-magnetic S8550 APD array (ref). PET data are transferred via optical fibers to an external (PCI)-based data acquisition board (ref). For simultaneous PET/MRI imaging a custom-made volume RF coil which fits inside the PET ring was used. The 9.4T microMRI used in all experiments is a superconducting horizontal bore magnet (Bruker Biospin 94/20, 400 MHz, Magnex scientific) interfaced to a Bruker Advance console and controlled by Paravision 5.0 software (Bruker Bio Spin, Billerica, Mass.). The magnet is equipped with an actively shielded combined RT-shim and gradient system (B-GA 12S) that can produce a maximum gradient strength of 200 mT/m. The 9.4T magnet is also rigged with a specially designed plastic support tube extending through the magnet's entire bore, which is isolated from the gradient set with noise-reducing concentric foam liners (this configuration reduces the noise from vibrations generated by the gradients during imaging). The support tube is big enough to accommodate two other plastic tube assemblies which are used for PET-MRI imaging; One tube is used to secure the RF coil inside the PET ring and the other is used to position the animal accurately within the PET-MRI device positioned in the center of the magnet (FIGS. 31A-C).",

The clearance of radio-labeled 3H-mannitol (MW 182 Da) (I) and 14C-inulin (MW-5 kDa) (J) was measured 60 min after infusion into contralateral frontal cortex. In wild type mice, TBI significantly slowed the clearance of both 3H-mannitol and 14C-inulin (#P<0.05, ###P<0.001 vs sham; 2-way ANOVA, n=6 animals per group). Clearance studies conducted in Aqp4\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated that impairment of solute clearance after TBI was exacerbated by Aqp4 gene deletion (*P<0.05, ***P<0.001 vs. WT; 2-way ANOVA, n=6 animals per group). These data demonstrate that glymphatic pathway function, including interstitial solute clearance, is profoundly and chronically impaired after TBI.",

(B-E) Movement of interstitial hTau through the brain was evaluated 30 min post-injection by immunofluorescence followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. hTau moved diffusely from the injection site (B), accumulating along the capillary basal lamina (C). Projections of fluorescence intensity depict hTau accumulations in these spaces relative to surrounding interstitial compartments. (D-E) 30 min post-injection, hTau moved rapidly through the brain interstitium to reach paravascular spaces surrounding the large-caliber internal cerebral veins in the roof of the 3rd ventricle. These data demonstrate that soluble interstitial tau is cleared from the brain along paravascular pathways of the brain-wide glymphatic system.",

Representative blots are presented showing effect of mouse genotype (wild type vs. Aqp4\u2212/\u2212), injury status (sham vs. TBI) and hemisphere (contralateral (C) vs. ipsilateral (I)) upon labeling by various P-tau monoclonal antibodies targeting different tau phosphorylation epitopes. Total tau was also measured (Pan-tau) and all P-tau levels were normalized to P-tau levels within each biological sample. (B-F) Across all epitopes, TBI tended to increase P-tau labeling, particularly on the ipsilateral side. Similarly, labeling tended to be stronger in Aqp4\u2212/\u2212 mice after TBI compared to wild type mice after TBI. Specifically, antibodies recognizing the pThr231 and pSer396 P-tau epitopes registered significant increases in P-tau labeling in Aqp4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild type animals (\u2020P<0.05, \u2020\u2020\u2020P<0.001 vs. Aqp4\u2212/\u2212 sham, \u2021P<0.05 vs. wild type TBI; *P<0.05 vs. wild type sham; #P<0.05 vs. contralateral structure; 1-way ANOVA; n=4 animals per group).

                                "(A) The Aqp4 gene has two transcription initiation site, with transcription initiated at each site resulting in two AQP4 mRNA variants: AQP4-M1 which includes Exons 0-4 of the Aqp4 gene and AQP4-M23 which lacks Exon 0. (B) AQP4-M23 (the predominant form in the CNS under physiological conditions) permits perivascular AQP4 packing while AQP4-M1 prevents it; thus increasing AQP4-M1 expression impairs AQP4 polarization (Crane et el. J Biol Chem 2009; Furman et al. Proc Nat Acad Sci 2003). (C) The expression of AQP4-M1 was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the mouse ipsilateral cortex 3 days after TBI using PCR primers specifically targeting Exon 0 of the AQP4-M1 transcript. Compared to AQP4-M1 expression in the control (sham) cortex, TBI increased AQP4-M1 expression by approximately two-fold (*P<0.05, t-test; n=5 per group). (D) Using an siRNA-based approach targeting Exon 0 of the AQP4-M1 variant, the expression of AQP4-M1 could be efficiently knocked down in cultured primary mouse cortical astrocytes. Three siRNA duplexes were designed to target Exon 0 of the AQP4-M1 transcript, and primary mouse astrocytes were transfected with these siRNA duplexes for six days. After siRNA treatment, AQP4-M1 expression was evaluated by qPCR, showing efficient knockdown of AQP4-M1 by siRNA targeting of Exon 0 (###P<0.001, siAQP4-M1 vs. Control, 1-way ANOVA; n=3). In silico screening of the Aqp4 gene promoter revealed two binding sites for the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 upstream of the AQP4-M1 transcription initiation site. Thus, we tested whether inhibition of STAT3 signaling in primary mouse cortical astrocytes could reduce AQP4-M1 expression. Treatment of primary astrocytes with the STAT3-specific inhibitor STATTIC significantly reduced AQP4-M1 expression (**P<0.01 STATTIC vs. control, 1-way ANOVA; n=3). These data demonstrate that AQP4-M1 expression is increased after TBI while AQP4-M1 expression can be reduced either by siRNA targeting of the AQP4-M1 transcript or by STAT3 inhibition in astrocytes. These findings are consistent with the notion that the loss of AQP4 polarization after brain injury (such as traumatic brain injury or ischemic brain injury) could be prevented through these approaches.",

(E) Quantification of fluorescence intensity 3 days post-injury 100 \u03bcm below the cortical surface by serial 2-photon imaging shows that in control animals, CSF tracer rapidly enters the cortex, peaking within 20 min of injection. In the ipsilateral cortex, CSF tracer influx is virtually abolished, while even in the contralateral cortex, CSF tracer influx is markedly impaired. These data demonstrate that diffuse ischemic injury, which causes loss of perivascular AQP4 polarization (Wang et al. J Neurosci 2012), also dramatically impairs glymphatic pathway function.",

                                "As disclosed in this example, a method is provided for modulating the brain's renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to enhance clearance of substances, such as amyloid-\u03b2, from brain. Alzheimer's disease is one major target for treatment by this method. Currently, there is no treatment that will slow or stop the progression of this devastating disease.",

                                "Background",
                                "Accumulation of toxic dysfunctional proteins in the brain is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the mechanism that leads to the accumulation of toxins in the aging brain is not completely known. In the case of AD, the two hallmarks are senile plaques, which are extracellular deposits of amyloid-\u03b2 toxins (A\u03b2), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau). The \u201camyloid cascade\u201d hypothesis suggests that the cognitive decline and the distinct pathogenic features in AD are related to abnormal accumulation of these toxins (Selkoe, 2001; Hardy, 2006).",
                                "A\u03b2 is produced by many cells in the body, including nerve cells in the brain, from a large protein called amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by proteases, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase, to produce A\u03b2 (Selkoe, 2001). In normal individuals, these toxins are present at low concentrations in the brain, but in AD they accumulate and their presence is a major event associated AD pathogenesis (Hardy & Selkoe, 2002). In a small number of cases (<1%) the A\u03b2 accumulation is due to it overproduction (early onset AD) while in the majority of cases its due to faulty clearance from brain (late on-set AD) (Tanzi, 2005; Tanzi et al., 2004; Mawuenyega et al., 2010). Increased levels of A\u03b2 in the brain result in formation of neurotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers, progressive synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction (Masters and Selkoe, 2012). A\u03b2 peptides are the main constituent of amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain parenchyma and in the vasculature (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA). A\u03b2 extracted from senile plaques is mainly peptides A\u03b21-40 (A\u03b240) and A\u03b21-42 (A\u03b242) while vascular amyloid is mainly peptides A\u03b21-39 and A\u03b240. The major soluble form of A\u03b2 present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain is A\u03b240. Soluble A\u03b2 which is circulating in CSF, and brain interstitial fluid (ISF) may exist as free peptide and/or associated with different binding proteins (carriers), such as apolipoprotein E (apoE), apolipoprotein J (apoJ), transthyretin, albumin, and \u03b12-macroglobulin (\u03b12M) (Deane et al., 2009). Therapies based only on lowering brain A\u03b2 production have, so far, been unsuccessful in clinical trials (Hardy, 2009).",
                                "A\u03b2 is eliminated from brain ISF through various routes, including cellular uptake and degradation, ISF convective flow, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-mediated transport (Deane et al., 2009). As disclosed herein, the glymphatic system is a macroscopic brain-wide path of CSF/ISF exchange that facilitates clearance of metabolic by-products, including A\u03b2. The glymphatic system is fundamental for the convective flow of brain ISF, mediated by astrocytes and functions similar to the peripheral lymphatic system. The glymphatic system consists of three main pathways: (1) CSF from the subarachnoid space re-enters brain via the para-arterial space, (2) astrocytic aquaporin 4 (AQP4, water channels specific in astrocytes) drives convective flow of brain ISF through the brain parenchyma, and (3) efflux via para-venous clearance. However, since the CSF rapidly enters the brain parenchyma along penetrating arteries, the glymphatic system may also act as a distribution path for brain-wide delivery of essential compounds as well as removing toxic compounds. Also, it is an appropriate mechanism that could clear the brain of all forms of A\u03b2, bound and free.",
                                "Fluid Balance in the Periphery",
                                "In the periphery, plasma volume and composition of salts (sodium chloride) and blood pressure are maintained by interacting systems, including hormones (aldosterone and vasopressin), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and the sympathetic nervous system. These mechanisms are well established (Dinh et al., 2001; Zucker, 2002; Persson, 2003; Burnier, 2003; Arnold et al., 2013; Ohshima et al., 2013). Reduced plasma volume causes the release of renin from the kidneys which in turn proteolytically cleave angiotensin I (a decapeptide) from the precursor angiotensinogen (produce in the liver) in plasma. Angiotensin I is further processed to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE). Furthermore, the cascade diverges with the procession of angiotensin I and angiotensin II to other active metabolites, including angiotensin (1-7), with contrasting biological actions (FIG. 54) Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7). Other enzymes may also play a role in the cascade of active metabolites of the RAS, such as cathepsin and neprilysin. Angiotensin II acts on two class of pharmacological G protein-couples receptors, angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R), whereas angiotensin (1-7) acts on the recently identified mas receptor. Angiotensin II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which retains sodium in plasma by reducing its excretion mainly by the kidneys. Angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction (maintain perfusion pressure). Simultaneously vasopressin is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland and promotes water retention by reducing water excretion by the kidneys. Collectively, these mechanisms maintain blood pressure, plasma (extracellular volume) volume and plasma salts concentrations. The reverse occurs when plasma volume is increased. In contrast to angiotensin II, Angiotensin (1-7) cause vasodilation by acting on receptor called Mas (Santos et al., 2003).",
                                "Angiotensin II actions on AT2 receptor also cause vasodilation. Thus a balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1-7) modulate the outcomes of the RAS. One of the key enzyme in this balancing of the RAS effects is believe to be the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, since it plays a major role in the conversion of angiotensin I and angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) (Gallagher et al., 2006).",
                                "Brain Renin Angiotensin System (RAS).",
                                "The brain RAS is believed to be independent of the RAS in the periphery (Mogi et al., 2012; Ohshima et al., 2013. The brain plays a major role is controlling blood pressure, plasma volume and salt composition by integration these established mechanisms. In addition, due to the BBB, it may control its own fluid environment (volume and composition of the ISF/ECF), perhaps in a similar way as the regulation of plasma volume and salts composition. In addition RAS has other roles not related to salt and water balance, such as neuroprotection, learning and inflammation. Activation of angiotensin 2 receptor and Mas receptor lead to vasodilation, neuroprotection, cognition, anti-proliferative effects and anti-hypertensive effects (Sudilovsky et al., 1987; Wang et al., 2007). In aging and in AD, the brain RAS is believed to be enhanced (Wright et al., 2010; Savaskan et al., 2001). Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme is increased in the caudate nucleus and cortex in AD (Arregui et al., 1982), which may influence risk of AD (Hemming et al., 2005; Najjar et al., 2012; Saavedra et al., 2012; AbdAlla et al., 2013)",
                                "In brain, astrocytes are a major source of angiotensinogen, the precursor for angiotensin I, and of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for the conversion into angiotensin (1-7) (Gallagher et al., 2006). Astrocytes also possess angiotensin 1 receptor. Thus astrocytes may play a key role in controlling brain ISF volume and salts. Moreover, recently we have shown that blocking noradrenalin receptors (\u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2) increased clearance of A\u03b2 and inulin from brain via the glymphatic system, (Xie et al., 2013). Noradrenalin, a neurotransmitter of the activated sympathetic nervous system and adrenergic system, increases the activity of renin, the enzyme that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Michael et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 1979; Macova et al., 2009). Thus, increasing the activity of the brain adrenergic system (Locus Coeruleus) in arousal (wakefulness) may increase RAS activity. This is associated with reduced clearance via the glymphatic system during wake state (Xie et al., 2013). Blocking the adrenergic system, as in a sleep state, is associated with increased clearance of substances from brain (Xie et al., 2013).",
                                "Thus, the RAS may play a major role in controlling clearance of ISF substances via the glymphatic system. However the role of the RAS in the clearance of substance present in the ISF is unclear.",

                                "Since this is a fundamental brain-wide system, it will have application to many diseases associated with accumulation of toxic substances in brain, including Aft This hypothesis was tested by using angiotensin II, angiotensin (1-7), blockers of angiotensin I receptor (Losartan, Valsartan) and blocker of angiotensin (1-7) receptor (A779) on clearance of 125I-A\u03b21-40 (referred to as A\u03b2) and 14C-inulin (referred to as inulin), a molecule that is cleared only by convective blow of ISF (Xie et al., 2013). The role of RAS on clearance of exogenous 125I-A\u03b2 and 14C-inulin were determined at 30 minutes after their injection into the frontal cortex (Xie et al., 2013). The role of RAS on the influx of these molecules into brain was determined by injecting these molecules into the subarachnoid space (cisterna magna) and determining brain levels after 30 minutes. A\u03b2 represented a peptide associated with AD and inulin an inert molecule and marker of convective flow of molecules in the ISF. The data confirm the hypothesis.",

                                "Members of the aquaporin family of intrinsic membrane proteins function as water-selective channels in the plasma membranes of many cells. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the predominant aquaporin found in brain. This example demonstrates that AQP4 modulates amyloid beta clearance from the brain. Either the activation of AQP4 can accelerate amyloid beta clearance from the brain, or the inhibition of AQP4 can exacerbate amyloid beta deposition in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Based on the results disclosed in this example, neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, can be treated with, ameliorated by, or prevented by, the drugs JNJ-17299425 or JNJ-17306861, which promote perivascular polarization of AQP4.",
                                "Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease are characterized by mis-aggregation of peptides and proteins into toxic aggregates and plaques, caused in part by the age- or injury-related failure of extracellular protein or peptide clearance. Extracellular protein and peptide clearance from the brain depends upon the perivascular localization of AQP4; polarization that is lost in the aging and injured brain. Maintaining perivascular polarization of AQP4 can be used to maintain the clearance of these solutes from the extracellular compartment, preventing or slowing the onset and progression of neurodegeneration.",
                                "Currently, no therapeutic approaches exist that prevent loss of AQP4 polarization in the aging brain. Instead, current approaches for dealing with these aggregates are aimed at preventing the production of their constituents or by targeting the aggregates for destruction. The former may be harmful, as these constituents are often physiologically active compounds that are necessary for normal function, while targeting of aggregates may take place too late in the pathological process to prevent neuronal loss. By maintaining \u2018normal\u2019 AQP4 polarization and clearance of these constituents, aggregation is prevented prior to the onset of disease and the loss of neurons.",
                                "JNJ-17299425 or JNJ-17306861 (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Titusville, N.J. 08560) and their derivatives are known to prevent the loss of AQP4 polarization after traumatic brain injury, while no other drug has yet been reported that can maintain AQP4 polarization. In one embodiment, by treating with JNJ-17299425 or JNJ-17306861 early in the neurodegenerative process, protein and peptide aggregation can be prevented without the need to alter cellular processes responsible for their production.",
                                "Amyloid beta clearance along these pathways is dependent upon AQP4 polarization. In models of diffuse ischemic injury and mild and moderate traumatic brain injury, perivascular AQP4 localization is consistently lost after brain injury. In both the aging mouse and human brain, perivascular AQP4 polarization is lost. This is accompanied by a failure of interstitial amyloid beta clearance. Loss of perivascular AQP4 polarization contributes to the failure of interstitial amyloid beta and tau clearance. Therapeutic approaches that maintain this polarization can be effective in preventing the onset of amyloid beta or tau aggregation as well as down-stream neurodegenerative processes.",
                                "Proof-of-concept studies are conducted to determine whether activation of AQP4 accelerates amyloid beta clearance from the brain, or whether inhibition of AQP4 exacerbates amyloid beta deposition in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
                                "JNJ-17299425 and JNJ-17306861 are tested to determine whether they can prevent loss of AQP4 polarization in the aging brain or in the young brain after traumatic brain injury.",
                                "JNJ-17299425 may improve AQP4 function by retaining it at the perivascular endfeet after traumatic injury. Prevention of AQP4 mis-localization in the aging and neurodegenerating brain may prevent amyloid beta and tau aggregation. Thus AQP4-targeting compounds JNJ-17299425 or JNJ-17306861 may be effective in maintaining amyloid beta and tau clearance in the aging brain, and preventing their aggregation.",
