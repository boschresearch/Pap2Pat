(A) Expression of Wnt-5a in the samples shown in Fig. 1 was determined by qRT-PCR. Data represent the fold difference relative to the reference gene (2 -ΔCt ) β2 microglobulin (B2M). * Mann-Whitney test (p<0.05) (B) Migration of primary CLL cells in the presence of selected chemokines (CC: CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL19, CCL21), Wnt5a alone and in combination with the chemokine (CC/Wnt5a) was analyzed using Transwell migration chambers. The data for each chemokine were normalized to CC/Wnt5a condition. The differences were not statistically significant. (C) Primary CLL cells nucleofected with the TopFlash reporter were stimulated with Wnt-3a, Wnt-5A or were co-transfected with constitutively active β-catenin (positive control). The reporter activity was determined using dual luciferase asssay and is shown as the fold change relative to unstimulated control. (D, F) Expression AXIN2, DKK1 (D), CXCR4 and WNT5A (F) in primary CLL cells stimulated as indicated was analyzed by qRT-PCR.

Expression of PRICKLE1 (A), FZD3 (B) and FZD7 (C) genes in B-cells of CLL patients (N=93) was determined by qRT-PCR using beta-actin as a reference gene. Patients were sorted into two groups (high vs. low expression) based on the mRNA levels of individual PCP genes (FZD3, FZD7, and PRICKLE1) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and survival analysis was performed in both groups of patients. FZD3-, FZD7-, and PRICKLE1-high patient cohorts patients had a significantly (Breslow test, P<0.05) worse prognosis compared to the group of patients with low expression of these genes. Analysis of surface proteins by flow cytometry 1x10 5 cells were washed twice in cold PBS, fixed in cold 100 % Methanol for at least 15 minutes, washed in azide buffer (1 % BSA, 0.1 % NaN 3 in PBS). Primary antibodies for goat Ror1, goat VangL, mouse Frizzled 3, goat Frizzled 7 (all from RnD Systems, Minneapolis, USA), and rabbit CELSR (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted 1:25 in azide buffer were incubated for 2 hours in 37 °C, then washed in azide buffer. Secondary antibodies diluted in azide buffer (anti-goat-Cy5 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA, anti-mouse-FITC 1:200, and anti-rabbit-FITC 1:100, both from Sigma) were added for 1 hour in 37 °C. After final wash in PBS samples were analyzed using FACScalibur (B.D., Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) in FL1 (green) channel.

### Cell treatments

For migration experiments, the following overnight treatments were used: anti-Ror1 (3 μg/mL; R&D Systems), and normal goat IgG (3 μg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), D4476 (casein kinase I inh. I; 100 μM; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), PF670462 (CK1 inh. II; 50 μM; Tocris Biosciences, Ellisville, Missouri, USA) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA), recombinant mouse Wnt-5a (200 ng/mL; R&D Systems), Rho-associated ROCK protein kinase inhibitor (10 and 100 μM, Y27632) (Sigma), Rac1 inhibitor (5, 10 and 20 μM, NSC23766) (Calbiochem), Stemolecule WNT inhibitor IWP2 (5 and 10 μM , Stemgent), monoclonal anti-CXCR4 (Fusin, R&D Systems), goat polyclonal anti-Wnt5a (R&D Systems). For cell transfection, the following siRNA was used: Dvl2 siRNA (h) and control siRNA-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

### Nucleofection

Cells were transfected using an Amaxa nucleofector system (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), using program X-01 and V solution for MEC1 cell lines according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 5x10 6 MEC1 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of V solution with the appropriate amount of siRNA (2 μM). Cells were left 18 hours in full media to recover after transfection and used for experiments.

### In vivo experiments (detailed)

NOD SCID IL2R gamma null (NSG) mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility. 

### TopFlash assay

CLL cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg Super 8X TopFlash construct and 0.1 μg Renilla luciferase (for HEK-Super TopFlash cells only with Renilla luciferase) using nucleofection. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h later with a Dual-Glo luciferase kit (Promega) and a MLX luminometer (Dynex Technologies). The firefly luciferase value in each well was normalized to the corresponding Renilla readout in order to control for transfection efficiency and general cell viability.

# SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL AND METHODS

## Patient samples

The study was approved by the local ethics committees and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients and healthy donors signed an informed consent. 

## RNA extraction and Quantitative qRT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Mini Kit and digested with DNase I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. RNA integrity (RIN > 8) was confirmed using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California). 500 ng of RNA was used as an input for reverse transcription (SuperScript II, Invitrogen).

Expression of PCP genes was assessed using Power SybrGreen Assay and 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California) or LC480 (Roche). Each primer pair was validated for its specificity using PCR and agarose electrophoresis. A list of specific primers with their sequences used for quantitative real-time analysis is available upon request.

## Western Blotting

Western blotting was performed as previously described ( 49). Briefly, 20 μg of protein sample lysed in NP40 lysis buffer was separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with following primary antibodies: anti-Ror1, anti-Vangl2, anti-Wnt5a (R&D Systems), anti-LEF1 and anti-Dvl2 (30D2, Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-Dvl3 (4D3), anti-CK1ε, anti-actin (C-11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Prickle1 (polyclonal antibody, Abcam), anti-β-catenin (BD Bioscience, Millipore) and anti-α-tubulin (12G10, Sigma). The secondary antibodies were used as follows: anti-goat IgG (whole molecule)-Peroxidase, anti-rabbit IgG [(whole Proliferation and cytotoxicity assay using WST1 tetrazolium salt 

## Quantification and statistics

Results obtained by Western blotting were quantified by the ImageJ software. T-test or Mann-Whitney test were applied to assess the difference in two continuous variables and one-way ANOVA (followed by Tukey post-hoc test) to assess the differences in more than two variables. The standard level of statistical significance was ≤0.05. All statistical tests were performed as two-sided using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California).
