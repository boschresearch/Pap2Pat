# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The invention relates to inhibitors of casein kinase 1 for use in the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

## BACKGROUND ART

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is clinically a very heterogeneous disease with an unclear pathogenesis. The current findings indicate that the cause of CLL is a monoclonal expansion of B-lymphocytes that then accumulate in both peripheral blood and lymphatic organs, which results in clinical complications such as hypertrophy of organs, reduced function of the immune system, anemia and others. It is believed that the disease evolves as a result of the defects in apoptosis and changes in the migration of B-lymphocytes.

CLL is characterized by the accumulation of dysfunctional malignant monoclonal B-lymphocytes in the blood and their migration to lymphatic nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The clinical progression of the disease then depends on the interaction of these dysfunctional cells with their immediate environment (micro-environment). This interaction then leads to uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells.

CLL is an incurable disease. The patients are regularly monitored and the treatment is commenced only at a significant progression of clinical symptoms. The standard treatment is a combination of chemo- and immuno-therapy (FCR; fludarabine+cyclophosphamide and rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody against surface receptor of B-lymphocytes), which leads to retreat of symptoms in majority of patients during the first treatment. Typically, however, the disease returns again after the first cycle of therapy and further therapy is often less effective. Moreover, the suitability of FCR regimen is very limited in patients with aggressive CLL associated with the deletion/mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor.

At present, huge effort is invested into the development and testing of drugs targeting cellular pathways involved in the interaction of CLL cells with their microenvironment in lymphatic organs. The medicaments are targeted in particular to the pathways activated upon interaction of the cells with antigen (signaling through the B-cell receptor, BCR), between adhesion molecules, and upon interaction of cellular receptors with the so-called chemotactic cytokines—chemokines that control the migration of the cells of the immune system in the body and inside the lymphatic organs. According to the first results, some of these substances show promising results even in patients who do not respond to FCR (Wayach J A et al., Blood 2012 Jun. 12; Honigberg L A et al., PNAS 2010 Jul. 20; 107(29): 13075-80; Herman S E et al., Blood. 2011 Jun. 9; 117(23): 6287-96; Herman S E et al., Blood. 2010 Sep. 23; 116(12): 2078-88). So far, however, there is no therapy routinely used in clinic, which targets primary causes of the disease.

## DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

The object of the present invention are inhibitors of casein kinase 1 (CK1) for use in the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The object of the present invention is use of the inhibitor of casein kinase 1 (CK1) for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The subject of the present invention is also a method of treatment of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia, comprising a step of administration of at least one inhibitor of casein kinase 1 (CK1) to a subject (mammal, preferably human) suffering from the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

In a preferred embodiment, the casein kinase 1 is selected from the group comprising casein kinase 1 delta (CK1δ) and casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1δ).

The inhibitor of CK1 is a substance that limits the activity of CK1 to 10% and less in comparison with control. Control is a solvent, in which the inhibitor is tested, used at the same quantity, however, without the inhibitor. The inhibition activity towards CK1 can be determined for example using in vitro kinase assay according to Bain et al. Biochem. J. (2007) 408, 297-315.

The CK1 inhibition prevents the migration of CLL cells in a chemokine gradient, thus preventing the cells from getting to the microenvironment that activates them. The CK1 inhibitors are capable of efficiently inhibiting the migration of leukemia cells to lymphatic organs. By this mechanism they prevent both the interaction of leukemia cells with the micro-environment of these organs leading to impaired functionality of these organs and development of CLL.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the CK1 inhibitor is D4476 (CAS No: 301836-43-1):

In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the CK1 inhibitor is PF670462 (CAS No: 950912-80-8):

In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the CK1 inhibitor is 1C261 (CAS No: 186611-52-9):

In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the CK1 inhibitor is PF 4800567 (CAS No: 1188296-52-7):

The subject of the present invention is further a medicament for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, containing at least one casein kinase 1 inhibitor, preferably a casein kinase 1 delta or casein kinase 1 epsilon inhibitor; most preferably a casein kinase 1 inhibitor selected from the group comprising D4476, PF670462, IC261, and PF 4800567.

## EXAMPLES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

### Effect of CK1 Inhibitors to the Migration of CLL Cells

In this example, the MEC1 cell line was used, which is a well-defined cell line obtained from a CLL patient in a pro-lymphocytic transformation. The MEC1 line is used as a transplantation model of CLL. MEC1 were obtained from the DSMZ collection (Braunschweig, Germany) and they were cultivated in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 ° C. and 5% of CO2.

Into the upper insert of HTS Transwell® 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Mexico) with polycarbonate membranes with the pore size of 5.0 μm, 0.5×106 MEC1 cells were seeded. The cells were treated overnight with D4476 (CK1 inhibitor, 100 μM, Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) in DMSO, or PF670462 (CK1 inhibitor, 50 μM; Tocris Biosciences, Ellisville, Mo., USA) in DMSO, or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; control—solvent of the inhibitors above, used in the same amount as in the experimental wells), and incubated in the complete medium (including 10% FCS) at 37 ° C. and 5% of CO2. The migration to chemokine was then analyzed using the Coulter Counter instrument (model FN, Coulter Electronics, Fla., USA). The migration index was calculated as the number of cells (treated or non-treated) migrating to the chemokine divided by the number of cells migrating only to the control medium.

In this example, inhibition of CK1ε kinase is tested, which is required for PCP signalization due to its role in the phosphorylation of the Dv1 protein. The inhibition of CK1ε using D4476 (CK1 inh. I) blocked the chemotactic response of MEC1 cells to CCL21 and CCL19 (FIG. 1), which shows that CK1ε is necessary for the migration of CLL to CCL21 and CCL19. To eliminate the effects that are non-specific for CK1ε, we repeated the same procedure with a well-defined PF670462 inhibitor specific for CK1δ and CK1ε with almost the same results.

Statistical Methods:

T-test or Mann-Whitney test were used for statistical evaluation to assess the difference between two continual variables, one-way ANOVA test (followed by the Tukey's post-hoc test) to evaluate the difference between more than two variables. The standard level of statistical significance was p=0.05. All statistical evaluations were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.).

### Effect of a CK1 Inhibitor on the Chemokine-Controlled Transendothelial Invasion of CLL Cells

In the complex environment of the human body, cells react to the attractants and have to pass through extra-cellular matrix or endothelial barrier, which is a process known as invasion. It was tested whether the CK1 inhibitors affect the invasion through a layer of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC).

Into the upper insert of HTS Transwell® 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Mexico) with polycarbonate membranes with the pore size of 5.0 μm, covered with HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells monolayer), 0.5×106 MEC1 cells were seeded. The cells were treated overnight with D4476 (CK1 inhibitor, 100 μM, Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) in DMSO, or PF670462 (CK1 inhibitor, 50 Tocris Biosciences, Ellisville, Mo., USA) in DMSO, or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; control—solvent of the inhibitors above, used in the same amount as in the experimental wells), and incubated in the complete medium (including 10% FCS) at 37° C. and 5% of CO2. The migration to chemokine was then analyzed using the Coulter Counter instrument (model FN, Coulter Electronics, Fla., USA). The migration index was calculated as the number of cells (treated or non-treated) migrating to the chemokine divided by the number of cells migrating only to the control medium.

First, the ability of CXCL12, CCL19, and CCL21 to induce the invasion of MEC1 cells in the Transwell wells coated with HUVEC was characterized. Of these three tested chemokines, only CCL19 was able to induce the transendothelial migration of the MEC1 cells. This response was not increased by Wnt5a, but it was significantly decreased by the CK1 inhibitor (FIG. 2).

### Inhibition of Migration of CLL Cells in Tissues in Vivo by CK1 Inhibitors

NOD SCID IL2R gamma null (NSG) mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were held in special pathogen-free conditions. These mice lack adult T-cells, B-cells and functional NK-cells. Non-irradiated mice (at the age of 8 to 16 weeks) were used for transplantation; the experiments were performed in accordance with legal provisions of the Czech Republic.

Primary B-cells from untreated patients with CLL were separated by gradient centrifugation followed by depletion of non-B-cells (RosetteSep® B Cell Enrichment Kit and Human CD3+ Depletion Kit; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada; or MACS B cell Isolation Kit II; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Evaluation of the expression profile of CD5 and CD19 of purified cells was performed using flow cytometry (three-color panel: CD45-TRI-COLOR, MHCD45065, Invitrogen, CD5-FITC, A08932, CD19-PE, A07769, Beckman Coulter). Samples with the purity higher than 95% of B-cells were used for further analyses.

Freshly isolated human CLL lymphocytes (25×106 from the patient) were pre-treated for 20 hours with a CK1 inhibitor (100 μM, D4476, Calbiochem), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) as control. The cells were then stained with Calcein AM (200 nM, Invitrogen) for 45 minutes and washed twice with sterile PBS. An aliquot of the pre-treated and Calcein AM stained cells (5×106) was used for FACS analysis (FACScalibur) to determine the effects on survival using the decrease of themitochondrial membrane potential as the readout (2 μM TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester), Invitrogen, 20 minutes of staining at the laboratory temperature). The transplantation to mice was performed by intra-peritoneal injection of 20×106 pre-treated and Calcein AM stained human CLL lymphocytes in 120 μl of sterile PBS. Samples of spleen, liver, and femoral bone marrow of mice were taken 24 hours after the injection and analyzed. Migration of calcein-positive CLL cells to these tissues was determined by FACS analysis (FACScalibur).

In this experiment, the rate of apoptosis of treated cells was determined by flow cytometry of the mitochondrial membrane potential using TMRE staining in combination with green calcein staining marking the living cells. The double-positive cells were considered as living and non-apoptotic.

The primary CLL cells in the NSG mice actively migrate into the corresponding tissues and they can be detected especially in the spleen, liver and bone marrow. The treatment by the CK1 inhibitor D4476 reduced the migration to the spleen, liver and bone marrow, without an increase of cell apoptosis being detected (FIG. 3). This experiment shows that the inhibition of CK1 reduces the ability of the CLL cells to migrate and colonize the tissues of mice.
