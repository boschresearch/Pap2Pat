                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The increasing demand on the one hand and depleting fossil fuels on the other, as energy sources has necessitated the development of alternative sources of energy. The production of renewable biofuels using naturally abundant lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural waste, forestry waste and municipal waste will reduce society's dependence on fossil fuels. Cellulose being the major component of lignocellulose, the need for novel and highly efficient cellulases have been realized enormously (Xing et al., 2012).",
                        "Cellulases find their use in versatile industrial applications such as in paper industry for deinking of recycled paper, textile industry for biopolishing of fabric and reducing harshness of cotton cloth, laundry industry as an additive to detergents, food and feed industry to improve the digestibility of food, brewing industry and agricultural industry for bioprocessing of crops and many other applications (Bhat, 2000; Xing et al., 2012).",
                        "Cellulases belong to glycosyl hydrolase family of enzymes which catalyse cellulolysis in a concerted manner. Endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) randomly cleaves the internal 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan linkage, producing free ends. Exoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.91 and 3.2.1.176) progressively act on reducing and non-reducing ends to release cellobiose. The di-ssacharide produced is then digested by \u03b2-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) to release free glucose. These enzymes work synergistically to bring the cellulose hydrolysis (Aubert et al., 1988; Lynd et al., 2002). Endoglucanases are the major enzymes to initiate and bring out extensive hydrolysis of internal linkages. Endoglucanases fall into 14 families of glycosyl hydrolase families, according to the classification by Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org/), (Lombard et al., 2014)",
                        "One of the approaches to discover novel cellulases is through metagenomics which is a culture-independent approach for studying the microbial diversity and exploring novel enzymes of industrial importance (Handelsman, 2004; Zengler et al., 2002).",
                        "Among the various natural environments, soil is the most diverse and challenging with respect to the microbiota present in it (Daniel, 2005). Many novel industrially relevant enzymes, like cellulases, amylases, lipases, proteases, xylanases etc. have been discovered from soil metagenomics (Daniel, 2005; Xing et al., 2012). Several of these enzymes have far superior properties w.r.t. activity, specificity, stability etc. than the known enzymes.",
                        "Many cellulases have been derived from the metagenomic studies, which have remarkable properties, like thermostability, halostability, pH stability. As examples, novel metagenomic GH5 cellulases have been isolated from ruminal fluid of cow which is active against wide range of substrates (Ko et al., 2013). A thermophillic GH9 endoglucanase having the optimal activity at 75\u00b0 C. have been isolated from sugarcane bagasse (Kanokratana et al., 2014). A metagenome derived GH12 cellulase isolated from leaf branch compost has the optimum temperature of 90\u00b0 C. (Okano et al., 2014). The cellulases isolated from rumen of cattle have specific activity ranging from 6-70 U/mg on CMC as substrate (Ferrer et al., 2008). Such properties, associated with newer proteins having industrial relevance is a great need for the full and successful aim of harvesting biomass as sources of affordable and green energy.",
                        "Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide cellulases which are active at high temperature, over wide pH range, broad stability and tolerance to a range of chemical and physical conditions, high activity in the presence of salts and chemicals etc."

(Madison, Wis.). DNA amplification and modifying enzymes such as Pfu DNA Polymerase, Restriction Endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, DpnI were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB, USA).",
                                "Phusion polymerase was procured from Thermo Scientific, USA. Oligonucleotides were synthesized from Integrated DNA technologies (IDT USA). The gel extraction of DNA as well as plasmid DNA isolation was done using the commercial kits and procedures suggested by manufacturers from Qiagen\u2122. The soil DNA isolation was done by using UltraClean\u2122 and PowerMax\u2122 (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., USA). The library was constructed in vector pEZSeg\u2122 (Lucigen corporation, Middleton, USA). Ni-NTA beads used to assist purification of protein carrying His-tag were from Qiagen. Automated DNA sequencing was done using ABI sequencer. Substrates for detecting cellulase activity like carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), para-nitro phenol cellobioside (pNPC), barley-\u03b2-glucan, avicel, laminarin etc. were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). All reagents used in the experiments were of highest quality grade available.\n\n\n- - 1. Recombinant DNA methods: In general, the methods and techniques\n    used for recombinant DNA preparations are the same as most commonly\n    used in the molecular biology with reference to text books like\n    Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Sambrook and\n    Russell, 2001). However, in the context of present invention, the\n    modifications are mentioned wherever they have been introduced in\n    the examples section.\n  - 2. Zymography for detection of cellulase activity was carried out\n    according to the protocol mentioned developed by Choi (Choi et al.,\n    2009). 10% SDS gel was run to resolve the proteins based on their\n    respective molecular weight. After electrophoresis, the gel was\n    washed with 2.5% Triton-X to remove SDS for 30 minutes followed by\n    thorough washing for 2-3 times with 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH-7.4). This\n    procedure removes Triton-X-100 on incubation for half an hour. The\n    gel was then overlaid on 0.5% agarose plate containing 0.5% CMC\n    substrate and incubated for at least 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Following\n    incubation, the gel was removed and the plate was stained with the\n    solution of 0.2% Congo red and followed by destaining with 1M NaCl.\n    The active band was visualized as yellow zone of clearance on plate.\n  - 3. SDS-PAGE was run according to the protocol developed by Laemmli\n    (Laemmli, 1970). Approximately 10 \u03bcg of Protein sample was mixed\n    with 5\u00d7 sample buffer (0.25M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. 15% SDS. 50%\n    glycerol. 25% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. 0.01% bromophenol blue). The\n    protein samples were denatured by boiling and centrifuged at 12,000\n    rpm for 5 minutes each. The discontinuous gel system was used having\n    different concentration and pH of the resolving and stacking\n    components. Resolving gel was casted in 1.5M Tris-Cl, pH-8.8 and\n    different poly-acrylamide concentrations depending on the size of\n    the protein.\n  - 4. The smaller sized protein requires high concentration of\n    acrylamide and vice-versa. 5% stacking gel was prepared in 0.5M\n    Tris-Cl, pH-6.8. Buffer tank was filled with 1\u00d7SDS running buffer\n    and constant current of 20 mA was provided till the protein dye\n    crosses stacking gel and current increased to 30 mA when the protein\n    dye enters resolving gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie\n    Brilliant Blue R250 dye solution (250 mg of dye in 4.5:4.5:1 mixture\n    of methanol:water:glacial acetic acid) with gentle shaking and\n    background absorbed dye was removed using destaining solution (30%\n    methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid).\n  - 5. CMC Assay: The detection of reducing sugars was done using DNS\n    (Di-nitro salicylic acid) assay. DNSA was prepared by dissolving 5\n    gm of dinitrosalicylic acid (1%) and 5 gm of NaOH (1%) in water.\n    Then 19.2% Rochelle salt (Na-potassium tartrate) was added and\n    dissolved. This was followed by addition of 0.05% Na-sulphite and\n    0.2% phenol. Lastly volume make up was done with water and then DNS\n    reagent stored in amber colour bottles at 4\u00b0 C. (Miller, 1959).\n  - 6. Glucose standard curve: Glucose monohydrate (1 mg/ml) was made in\n    water and different volumes (upto 60 \u03bcl) were taken in 96-well PCR\n    plates and 60 \u03bcl of DNS reagent was added (Xiao et al., 2005). All\n    experiments were done in triplicates. The plate was covered with\n    plastic mat and the reaction was subjected to heating at 95\u00b0 C. for\n    5 minutes and then 100 \u03bcl of it was transferred to 96-well\n    micro-plate and absorbance was taken at 540 nm (Miller, 1959).\n    Reducing sugar concentration was calculated from a standard curve\n    using the equation (y=mx+c).\n  - 7. Cellulase activity was measured in 60 \u03bcl reaction containing 30\n    \u03bcl of appropriately diluted enzyme and 30 \u03bcl of 2% CMC (dissolved in\n    water). Care was taken so that the final concentration of\n    sodium-citrate buffer (pH-6) remained 100 mM in reaction. The\n    reaction was incubated at its optimum temperature for specified time\n    and terminated with 60 \u03bcl of DNS reagent as explained above.\n    Appropriate blanks were also included, one without enzyme (enzyme\n    blank) and other without substrate (substrate blank)."
