    "title": "Biochemical and structural characterization of a novel halotolerant cellulase from soil metagenome",
    "date": "2016-12-23",
    "abstract": "Cellulase catalyzes the hydrolysis of \u03b2-1,4-linkages of cellulose to produce industrially relevant monomeric subunits. Cellulases find their applications in pulp and paper, laundry, food and feed, textile, brewing industry and in biofuel production. These industries always have great demand for cellulases that can work efficiently even in harsh conditions such as high salt, heat, and acidic environments. While, cellulases with high thermal and acidic stability are already in use, existence of a high halotolerant cellulase is still elusive. Here, we report a novel cellulase Cel5R, obtained from soil metagenome that shows high halotolerance and thermal stability. The biochemical and functional characterization of Cel5R revealed its endoglucanase activity and high halostability. In addition, the crystal structure of Cel5R determined at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution reveals a large number of acidic residues on the surface of the protein that contribute to the halophilic nature of this enzyme. Moreover, we demonstrate that the four free and non-conserved cysteine residues (C65, C90, C231 and C273) contributes to the thermal stability of Cel5R by alanine scanning experiments. Thus, the newly identified endoglucanase Cel5R is a promising candidate for various industrial applications.",

                        "A metagenomic library was constructed in pEZSeq vector using the DNA directly isolated from the soil. The library had the average insert size of 2\u20135\u2009kb. Functional screening of the library on LB plates containing 0.5% CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose) revealed a positive clone with an insert size of ~5\u2009kb that showed a clear zone of hydrolysis on CMC plate. The plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive colony and subsequently sequenced by primer walking. The sequence analysis showed the presence of a gene cluster of 5553 bases consisting of several open reading frames (ORFs) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The different ORF\u2019s along with the most probable hits and their accession numbers are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The ORF showing putative cellulase (cel5R\u03b1) of size 1014\u2009bp encodes for a 338 amino acid residue protein belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 5, subfamily 2 (GH5_2) according to CAZy (Carbohydrate Active enZYmes) database classification20. The BLAST search using the nucleotide sequence of cel5R\u03b1 revealed about 65-70% identity (up to 30% query coverage) with other known cellulases. However, the closest endoglucanase from Paludibacter propionicigenes which showed 68% identity with cel5R\u03b1 has not been characterized yet. Similarly, the BLAST search using the deduced amino acid sequence of cel5R\u03b1 revealed about 40\u201370% identity (up to 90% query coverage) with that of known cellulases and closest being endoglucanase from Paludibacter jiangxiensis, (69% identity; 81% similarity) which is also not yet been characterized. Pfam database predicted a conserved domain in Cel5R\u03b1 belonging to GH5 family of cellulase. Phylogenetic tree analysis also indicated that the cel5R\u03b1 ORF belongs to GH5 family of cellulase and clustered with the three main anaerobic cellulolytic organisms Paludibacter, Prevotella buccae and Bacteroides sps. (Supplementary Fig. S2). Multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW21 revealed that the active site residues of GH5 endoglucanases were all conserved in Cel5R\u03b1 (Supplementary Fig. S3). The molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of full length polypeptide sequence was estimated to be 38662.5 Daltons and 4.86, respectively."

The Cel5R\u03b1 protein was found to be expressed in insoluble fraction (data not shown) which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. However, when the crude cell lysate from E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells harboring pET15b-cel5R\u03b1 was incubated onto the well bored in LA-CMC plate along with the empty vector cell lysate (negative control), a clear zone of hydrolysis was visible around the well after staining with congo red. This result indicated that Cel5R\u03b1 encodes for cellulase with CMCase (Carboxymethyl cellulase) activity (data not shown), although, its expression in E. coli cells was found in inclusion bodies. It is known in literature that the removal of the hydrophobic signal peptide can increase the expression and solubility of the recombinant protein without altering the biochemical and functional properties22. The sequence analysis of Cel5R\u03b1 by SignalP 4.1 revealed the presence of N-terminal signal peptide with the cleavage site between the Thr-27 and Glu-28 residues. Accordingly, the initial N-terminal 27 amino residues were removed from Cel5R\u03b1 to create Cel5R. The expression of Cel5R in E. coli resulted in higher levels of protein in soluble form. The size of the protein was confirmed on 10% SDS-PAGE which showed an over-expressed protein band close to 38\u2009kDa. Two step purification using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by gel permeation chromatography of over-expressed protein resulted in pure monomeric population of Cel5R (Fig. 1a). Zymography also clearly exhibited a single band of activity against the expected size of 38\u2009kDa (Fig. 1b) confirming the correct size and active form of Cel5R."

                        "The enzyme activity of Cel5R and other biochemical and kinetic parameters were determined by DNS (3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid) method using CMC as substrate. The optimal temperature for the enzyme activity was found to be 58\u2009\u00b0C (Fig. 2a) with half-life period of about 10\u2009hours. However, at optimum temperature, the half-life of Cel5R was enhanced to 16\u2009hours in the presence of 0.2% CMC (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the Cel5R kept at 4\u2009\u00b0C and 25\u2009\u00b0C was stable for several days without much loss in activity while at 50\u2009\u00b0C and 55\u2009\u00b0C its half-life was found to be 340\u2009hours and 150\u2009hours respectively, which revealed its thermostable behavior (Fig. 2c).",
                        "While, Cel5R showed catalytic activity in the pH range of 5.0-6.5, the highest catalytic activity was observed at pH 6.0 in 100\u2009mM sodium-citrate buffer (Fig. 2d). In addition, Cel5R was stable over a relatively broad pH range i.e. between pH 5\u20139, as it retained 80\u2013100% activity after 7 days of incubation at room temperature (Fig. 2e). At pH 4, the enzyme retained 50% hydrolytic activity after 24\u2009hours of incubation at room temperature (data not shown). Differential effect of sodium-acetate and sodium-citrate buffer of same pH value and strength on activity (two fold higher activity in citrate buffer) was also observed (data not shown) which may be due to the difference in adsorption of anions on the Cel5R molecule leading to aggregation or unfolding23. Moreover, the kinetic studies with different concentration of substrate (CMC) revealed a typical Michaelis-Menten behavior of Cel5R with Km and Vmax value of 5\u2009mg/ml and 312\u2009U/mg respectively.",
                        "The activity profiling of Cel5R on various substrates suggested that it was very specific to \u03b2-1,4-glucosidic linkages of CMC (220\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009U/mg) and mixed \u03b2-1,4 and \u03b2-1,3-glucosidic linkages of barley-\u03b2-glucan (435\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009U/mg). It also cleaved the agluconic \u03b2-D-cellobioside linkage in pNPC (1.85\u2009U/mg) but was not active on pNPG indicating its endo-mode of action. Also Cel5R could not hydrolyze laminarin which has \u03b2-1,3 linkages and displayed no activity on xylan, starch and locust bean gum (Table 1). Insoluble crystalline substrates like avicel and filter paper were also resistant to Cel5R activity but phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) which was swollen amorphous form of avicel provided the sites for Cel5R hydrolysis. PASC is generally composed of cellulose II form which is accepted as the model for naturally occurring amorphous cellulose2425. Cel5R displayed 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009U/mg on PASC which may vary from different lots of substrate due to its heterogeneity. Thus, Cel5R is a novel endoglucanase with a high specific activity on soluble substrates as well as insoluble amorphous PASC.",
                        "The activity of Cel5R was tested in the presence of various metal ion salts. Most of them had no effect on activity while 1\u2009mM of CoCl2, FeSO4, MnCl2 and FeCl3 enhanced the activity slightly. Cel5R is not a metallo-enzyme as EDTA did not inhibit its activity completely. Cel5R had significant activity in the presence of methanol and ethanol at 5% concentration while propanol and butanol had diminishing effect. The DMSO enhanced the Cel5R enzymatic activity by about 10%. Detergents (Tween 20, Tween 80, Triton X-100) tested at 0.25% concentration had little effect while SDS completely abolished the activity of Cel5R (Fig. 3a). Also, Cel5R was completely inhibited by 1\u2009mM AgNO3, HgCl2, and p-(Hydroxymercuri)benzoic acid (pHMB) indicating that thiols might play role in catalysis26 (Fig. 3a)."

                        "Interestingly, we observed that the hydrolytic activity of Cel5R was enhanced on increasing the salt concentration in the assay. There was about 24%, 28% and 13% enhancement in the catalytic activity of Cel5R in the presence of 1\u2009M, 2\u2009M and 3\u2009M NaCl respectively (Fig. 3b). Likewise, 1\u2009M, 2\u2009M and 3\u2009M concentrations of KCl also had almost 30% enhancing effect (Fig. 3b). On the other hand lithium ion (Li+) had diminishing effect on activity probably due to its high hydration energy which may lead to distortion of water structure around the macromolecule27. Moreover, Cel5R showed a remarkable stability in the presence of 4\u2009M NaCl, 3\u2009M LiCl and 2\u2009M KCl on prolonged incubation for 30 days at room temperature (Fig. 3c). The Cel5R retained 100% activity in the presence of 3\u2009M LiCl, 75\u201380% activity in 4\u2009M NaCl, and 70-80% activity in 2\u2009M KCl which categorized it as an extreme halostable cellulase2829. Surprisingly, Cel5R retained 70\u2013100% activity when incubated for one year in the presence of salts 2\u2009M NaCl, 3\u2009M LiCl and 1\u2009M KCl (Fig. 3c)."

                        "The DTNB (5,5\u2032-dithiobis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid]) assay under denaturing conditions confirmed the presence of four free cysteine residues which are not conserved as seen by multiple sequence alignment (Supplementary Fig. S3). The observed near-complete inhibition of endoglucanase activity by thiol inhibitors led us to investigate the role of free cysteines in the activity of Cel5R. Moreover, it has been shown that the substitution of free thiols with other amino acid residues increased30 the thermal stability of the protein in some cases, while in others it is decreased31. Thus, to understand the role of cysteines in Cel5R, different constructs with single, double and quadruple mutations (cysteine to alanine) were made and their activities were checked by DNS (3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid) assay. Though most of the single (C65A, C90A, C231A, C273A) and double mutants (C65A/C90A, C65A/C231A, C65A/C273A C90A/C231A, C90A/C273A, C231A/C273A) had lesser or comparable activity to wild type Cel5R, the cysteine free mutant retained only 20% activity (Table 2). However, the major elements of secondary structure contents remained same in wild type and cysteine free mutant as confirmed by CD experiments (Fig. 4a). As previously discussed, the wild type Cel5R was inactivated by Hg2+, Ag+ and pHMB. Similar to wild-type, the Hg2+ also inhibited the activity of cysteine free mutant of Cel5R. This may be due to binding of Hg2+ with other residue such as tryptophan which is shown to be essential for substrate binding in GH5 family32. However, unlike the wild-type, the pHMB did not affect the activity of cysteine-free mutant of Cel5R indicating pHMB may bind to thiols as the inhibition of Cel5R was reversed in the presence of DTT (data not shown).",
                        "In addition, the temperature optima of cysteine-free mutant (46\u2009\u00b0C) shifted towards lower temperature compared to wild type (58\u2009\u00b0C) (Fig. 4b). The cysteine-free mutant was also thermally less stable as shown by thermal inactivation curve (Fig. 4c). The thermal unfolding experiment study by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) showed that the melting temperature was shifted by 10\u2009\u00b0C between wild type (Tm- 65\u2009\u00b0C) and cysteine-free mutant (Tm- 55\u2009\u00b0C) (Fig. 4d). Notably, the melting temperature of single and double mutants was lower than the wild type Cel5R except C273A which had Tm slightly higher than wild type (Table 2). Thus, mutating all cysteines to alanine drastically reduced the thermo-stability of Cel5R, indicating the role of cysteines in maintaining the native-like structure and stability."

The crystal belonged to P212121 space group, and consists of two Cel5R molecules in an asymmetric unit. The results of PISA33 server did not indicate any stable interaction at the protein-protein interface, thus eliminating the possible existence of Cel5R as dimer in solution. This result was also consistent with analytical size-exclusion chromatography studies where Cel5R eluted as a monomer. The PDBeFOLD34 server predicted Cel5A from Baciilus agaradhaerens (PDB id: 1QI2) to be the closest structural homolog with root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.86\u2009\u00c5 over 293\u2009C\u03b1 atoms.

                        "To identify the catalytic site of Cel5R, we superimposed its structure with other known GH5 family cellulase structures such as B. agaradhaerens (PDB ID: 1QI2, rmsd 0.9\u2009\u00c5 for 293\u2009C\u03b1 atoms; PDB ID: 1H5V, rmsd 1.0\u2009\u00c5 for 293\u2009C\u03b1 atoms) and Bacillus sp. (PDB ID: 1G0C, rmsd 1.4\u2009\u00c5 for 291\u2009C\u03b1 atoms) that were bound with the substrates. The superposition of these structures revealed that the residues forming the catalytic site were well conserved in Cel5R suggesting it may display a similar catalytic mechanism35. It is known that the hydrolysis of glycosidic bond is carried out by general acid catalysis which requires two vital residues that act as a proton donor and nucleophile/base36. Moreover, depending on the distance between the two vital residues, the hydrolysis of glycosidic bond may procced with a mechanism of either overall retention or an inversion of anomeric configuration36. The enzyme with retaining mechanism shows an average distance of 5.5\u2009\u00c5 between the two catalytic residues while it is about 10\u2009\u00c5 for inverting enzyme36. The superposition of Cel5R with other cellulases indicated that the residues Glu143 and Glu230 were likely to be two critical residues, where Glu143 acts as a proton donor while Glu230 acts as a nucleophile. In Cel5R the distance between Glu143 and Glu230 was found to be 6.2\u2009\u00c5 suggesting it may follow retaining mechanism. In addition, to identify the residues involved in substrate binding we superimposed the B. agaradhaerens GH5 (1H5V) structure complexed with glucose units on to the Cel5R crystal structure37 (Fig. 5b). In 1H5V, the active site was bound with five glucose units and located at \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, +1 and +2 subsite positions respectively. The superimposition revealed that, in Cel5R, the subsite \u22123 was occupied by Asn270 from the other monomer of Cel5R. In addition, the stacking interaction provided by the Trp39 residue with the glucose molecule at \u22123 subsite was missing in Cel5R as the corresponding residue was replaced by Leu46. The substitution of Trp to Leu at the catalytic site had been shown to play a role in substrate binding3839. In Cel5R, the subsites \u22122 and \u22121 were occupied by glycerol molecules (Fig. 5b). The cis peptide bond formed between Trp264-Ser265 in Cel5R (Trp262\u2013Ser263 in case of 1H5V) was conserved and this Trp residue provided the hydrogen bond interaction at subsite \u22122. The glycerol molecule positioned at \u22122 subsite in Cel5R, interacted with Trp43 through its O1 while its O2 interacted with Lys 269 and Glu 271. Similarly, the glycerol molecule in Cel5R close to \u22121 subsite interacted with His110, Asn 142, Glu 230 and Glu 143. The residues which were expected to form interactions at +1 and +2 subsites were also conserved in Cel5R.",
                        "Despite such a striking similarity with other non-halophilic GH5 structures, the high halotolerance and halostability showed by Cel5R was surprising. Although, literature survey indicated that the structural determinants for the halotolerance of the enzyme is still elusive, a consensus based on the analysis of different halotolerant/halophilic proteins suggested that they tend to possess more acidic residues on the surface of the protein than their non-halophilic homologs40. Specifically, both Asp and Glu residues on the surface have been shown to contribute significantly towards their halotolerance40. Interestingly, the analysis of amino acid sequence of the Cel5R and its structure revealed that there were 52 acidic residues (Asp\u2009+\u2009Glu; 16.7%) present on its surface which were relatively higher than other halophilic cellulases reported till now."

This optimum temperature is comparable to BsCel5A cellulase that was isolated from Bacillus subtilis 168 (Topt-60\u2009\u00b0C) and CelI15 from Bacillus subtilis I15 (Topt-60\u2009\u00b0C) which are close structural homologue of Cel5R4243.

KSM-S237 (Topt-45\u2009\u00b0C) and Bacillus strain C1 (Topt-50\u2009\u00b0C)4445. Notably, the thermostability is enhanced when Cel5R is incubated in the presence 0.2% CMC at 58\u2009\u00b0C which could be due to stabilization provided by the hydrolyzed products to the active site46.",
                "Cel5R shows catalytic activity in the pH range of 5.0\u20136.5. This is similar to the already reported BsCel5A from Bacillus subtilis 168, a structural homologue of Cel5R42. On the other hand, Cel5A from Baciilus agaradhaerens, another structural homologue of Cel5R, is an alkaliphilic cellulase and becomes inactive at low pH47. Cel5R is also stable over a relatively broad pH range i.e. pH 5\u20139 for seven days at room temperature. Thus Cel5R can tolerate both acidic as well as basic pH range. A recently published report on the acid stable endoxyloglucanse showed pH stability in the range of 3.5\u20137 for only 24\u2009hours48. In other report, acid-stable cellulase derived from a metagenome retained about 80% of maximum activity from pH 5 to 9 for only 16\u2009hours49.",
                "We have observed that the catalytic activity of Cel5R was inhibited by thiol reagents such as pHMB and Hg2+ suggesting that cysteines might play a role in catalysis. However, biochemical and structural characterization have revealed that all the cysteine residues in Cel5R exist in reduced form and they are not part of the catalytic site. Therefore, to understand the contribution of cysteine residues in the catalysis of Cel5R, they were substituted to alanine, which is the least destabilizing substitution for cysteine50. Interestingly, while the single and double mutants of Cel5R have lesser or comparable catalytic activity to that of wild type, the cysteine free mutant retained only 20% catalytic activity to that of wild type (Table 2) indicating that the free cysteines might play a role in catalysis. In addition, a large body of published reports shows that free cysteine residues have stabilizing effect and renders thermostability to the protein51. However, in some cases the free cysteines are reactive and unstable and their replacement with other amino acid resulted in increased thermostability of the protein52. Thus, to understand the contribution of free cysteines in the thermostability, we measured the melting temperature of wild type and cysteine mutants of Cel5R. The wild type, single and double mutants of Cel5R show comparable thermostability while it is decreased significantly for the mutant devoid of all cysteines (Table 2). This is in contrast to the previous report where the removal of free cysteines improved the thermotolerance of Cel6A53. The crystal structure analysis indicates that the free cysteines in Cel5R are involved in hydrogen bond interaction with the neighboring residues that are participating in catalysis (interactions between Cys65 with Leu59, Cys90 with Phe86, Cys231 with Val262 and Csy273 with Gly238, Glu271). The mutation of free cysteine residues may perturb these hydrogen bonds and possibly the van der Waals interactions, causing reduced catalytic activity and thermostability of Cel5R. A similar reduction in catalysis and thermostability is also observed in family 11 xylanase54. Taken together we show that the free cysteines in Cel5R play a role both in catalytic activity and thermostability although they are not part of the active site.",
                "In addition to thermostability and pH stability, halotolerance and extreme halostability shown by Cel5R suggested that the gene might belong to a halophilic organism, but it is not possible to determine the organism to which it belonged. When the activity was checked after one year of prolonged incubation with high salt conditions, it was observed that the presence of salts (2\u2009M NaCl, LiCl and KCl) conferred stability to Cel5R compared to control reaction where no salt was present. Moreover, Cel5R shows activity in the presence of high salt concentration. Recently, it has been reported that the halophilic cellulase isolated from Icelandic hot spring showed decreased activity in the presence of increasing concentration of NaCl compared to control reaction with no salt19. On the other hand, the thermophilic GH5 endoglucanase isolated from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4 retains less than 15% of its activity after 12-hours of pre-incubation in 4\u2009M NaCl55. The enzyme isolated by Voget et al. retained 86% activity after incubation with 3\u2009M NaCl, 3\u2009M RbCl or 4\u2009M KCl for 20\u2009h56. However, Cel5R shows extreme halostability for a longer duration as compared to the previous published reports. The halotolerance arises due to the presence of acidic residues (Asp and Glu) on the surface of protein and halophilic proteins have large number of charged surface residues than their non-halophilic counterparts40. In fact, the mutation of surface residues in malate dehydrogenase from H. marismortui57 and glucose dehydrogenase from H. mediterranei58 affected only the halophilic properties of mutant without affecting the kinetic parameters and enzymatic activity of the protein. The crystal structure analysis also reveals that the halophilic nature shown by Cel5R may be due to acidic residues (16.7% with 52 residues) present on the surface of the protein (Fig. 5c and d). In contrast, the endoglucanase from Bacillus subtilis 168 (PDBID: 3PZT) has only 38 (11.6%) acidic residues42 and the recently discovered GH5 cellulase from Thermoanaerobacterium which is also shown to be halostable cellulase has only 43 (11.3%) acidic residues present in it19. Thus, based on these observations, we speculate that the halotolerant ability shown by the Cel5R is due to large number of acidic residues (Asp\u2009+\u2009Glu) present on the surface of the protein. This property makes Cel5R, ideal, to be used in various industrial processes where concentrated salt solutions formed after pretreatment and neutralization of biomass would otherwise inhibit enzymatic conversions59. Thus, Cel5R is an example of extreme halotolerant cellulase despite being the fact that it is isolated from moderate environment."
