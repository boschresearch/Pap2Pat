                                "Human organs may be defined by their complex, functional organization of diverse, specialized cells and tissues1. The rising incidence rates of disease and injury leading to organ failure have led to increased demand for tissue and organ transplants. This growing demand has given rise to tissue engineering, whereby scaffolds, cells, and biologically active molecules are combined to assemble functional constructs. The goal is to develop constructs capable of restoring, improving, or maintaining damaged tissues and organs2. Of the many methods to generate these functional three-dimensional structures, 3D-bioprinting is most promising due to its ability to produce complex, scalable tissue constructs. The printing of these cellularized structures through the precise layering of cell-laden bioinks may be accomplished using inkjet-based, extrusion, stereolithography, or laser-assisted printing systems3-5. While each printer has its advantages over the others, many challenges remain to face before this technology can be translated into clinical practice, regardless of the printer setup6.",
                                "Significant issues with 3D bioprinting include identifying suitable bioinks and ensuring adequate nutrient supply to the cells7-12. While a great deal of effort has been focused on developing novel biomaterial candidates, it has been much harder to find a solution to address the diffusion barrier associated with the printed construct. The diffusion barrier is an inherent result of the nature of the bioink scaffolding material, which hinders the migration of nutrients, ranging from growth factors to oxygen, to the center. This diffusion barrier must be overcome as delivering these nutrients ensures the cells' survival, proliferation, and differentiation.",
                                "As such, oxygen-releasing biomaterials have been explored as a means of promoting its diffusion throughout the construct. Most of the oxygen-releasing biomaterials developed so far involve scaffolds integrated with peroxides and fluorinated compounds in the form of liquids or solid micro- and nanoparticles13, 14. Although early reports of these materials are promising, they all require the insertion of materials that do not occur naturally within the human body15-17. This introduces additional uncertainty about the fate of these materials as they lack the inherent biodegradability of bio-molecules, such as proteins.",
                                "Due to the limitations of the oxygen-releasing biomaterials, there exists a need for a new class of biomaterials that can facilitate nutrient migration within the tissue constructs.",
                                "Furthermore, haloarchaeal gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs) are attractive for biotechnological and biomedical applications and have already found use as drug delivery systems and contrast agents for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging22-27. While the biotechnological tools for the expression of GVNPs are established, production so far suffers from the slow growth rates, the inconsistent induction system, and genetic instability of the Halobacterium expression host.",
                                "Therefore, a method of fast and efficient production of GVNPs is also needed.",
                                "In addition, it is also desirable to provice a biocompatible compound that is capable of forming a hydrogel that meets at least some of the above requirements to a higher extent than currently available hydrogels and that is not restricted by the above mentioned limination."

                                "3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising method for the engineering of tissues and organs. Still, it faces challenges in its widespread use due to issues with the development of bioink materials and the nutrient diffusion barrier inherent to these scaffold materials. Disclosed embodiments introduce a method to promote oxygen diffusion throughout the printed constructs using genetically encoded gas vesicles derived from haloarchaea. These hollow nanostructures are comprised of a protein shell that allows gases to permeate freely while excluding the water flow. After printing cells with gas vesicles of various concentrations, the cells are observed to have increased activity and proliferation. These results suggest that air-filled gas vesicles can help overcome the diffusion barrier throughout the 3D bioprinted constructs by increasing oxygen availability to cells within the center of the construct. The biodegradable nature of the gas vesicle proteins combined with the disclosed promising results permits their potential use as oxygen-promoting materials in biological samples.",

Over the years, gas vesicle nanoparticles have drawn interest in biotechnological and biomedical applications. This includes traditional nanoparticle applications as drug delivery systems and other applications based on their unique physical properties.

As the GVNPs constitute the thin protein-membrane and the gases inside and are permeable to gases in the environment, the effect is likely due to the gas permeability of the protein shell. One way, through which this can occur, is by promoting the availability of oxygen to the cells, as the oxygen is allowed to diffuse from within the gas vesicles to the surrounding environment. In one embodiment, the increased oxygen availability may render the environment more similar to favorable in vivo conditions, thereby promoting cell survival. In another embodiment, nearby GVNPs enable cells to clear waste or other species within the environment more rapidly. Byproducts of cellular respiration include CO2. Therefore, the permeability of the GVNP shell coupled with the concentration gradient of the different gases in the system may have promoted the diffusion of CO2 away from the cells.",

Intact gas vesicles were collected and re-suspended in PBS solution, then floated by overnight centrifugation and harvested again. This floatation procedure was repeated until a white, milky suspension of gas vesicles was obtained. Gas vesicle concentration was quantified via NanoDrop\u00ae 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific\u00ae, Waltham, Mass., USA) by measuring a small sample of gas vesicles broken by sonicating for several minutes."
