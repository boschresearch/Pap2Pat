## BACKGROUND

### Field of the Invention

The present disclosure relates to a method of high yielding production of gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs) and tools used for high-yielding GVNPs production. The present disclosure further relates to a method of creating 3D tissue constructs with improved cell viability and proliferation and the resulting 3D tissue constructs.

### Background of the Invention

Human organs may be defined by their complex, functional organization of diverse, specialized cells and tissues1. The rising incidence rates of disease and injury leading to organ failure have led to increased demand for tissue and organ transplants. This growing demand has given rise to tissue engineering, whereby scaffolds, cells, and biologically active molecules are combined to assemble functional constructs. The goal is to develop constructs capable of restoring, improving, or maintaining damaged tissues and organs2. Of the many methods to generate these functional three-dimensional structures, 3D-bioprinting is most promising due to its ability to produce complex, scalable tissue constructs. The printing of these cellularized structures through the precise layering of cell-laden bioinks may be accomplished using inkjet-based, extrusion, stereolithography, or laser-assisted printing systems3-5. While each printer has its advantages over the others, many challenges remain to face before this technology can be translated into clinical practice, regardless of the printer setup6.

Significant issues with 3D bioprinting include identifying suitable bioinks and ensuring adequate nutrient supply to the cells7-12. While a great deal of effort has been focused on developing novel biomaterial candidates, it has been much harder to find a solution to address the diffusion barrier associated with the printed construct. The diffusion barrier is an inherent result of the nature of the bioink scaffolding material, which hinders the migration of nutrients, ranging from growth factors to oxygen, to the center. This diffusion barrier must be overcome as delivering these nutrients ensures the cells' survival, proliferation, and differentiation.

As such, oxygen-releasing biomaterials have been explored as a means of promoting its diffusion throughout the construct. Most of the oxygen-releasing biomaterials developed so far involve scaffolds integrated with peroxides and fluorinated compounds in the form of liquids or solid micro- and nanoparticles13, 14. Although early reports of these materials are promising, they all require the insertion of materials that do not occur naturally within the human body15-17. This introduces additional uncertainty about the fate of these materials as they lack the inherent biodegradability of bio-molecules, such as proteins.

Due to the limitations of the oxygen-releasing biomaterials, there exists a need for a new class of biomaterials that can facilitate nutrient migration within the tissue constructs.

Furthermore, haloarchaeal gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs) are attractive for biotechnological and biomedical applications and have already found use as drug delivery systems and contrast agents for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging22-27. While the biotechnological tools for the expression of GVNPs are established, production so far suffers from the slow growth rates, the inconsistent induction system, and genetic instability of the Halobacterium expression host.

Therefore, a method of fast and efficient production of GVNPs is also needed.

In addition, it is also desirable to provice a biocompatible compound that is capable of forming a hydrogel that meets at least some of the above requirements to a higher extent than currently available hydrogels and that is not restricted by the above mentioned limination.

### DESCRIPTION

3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising method for the engineering of tissues and organs. Still, it faces challenges in its widespread use due to issues with the development of bioink materials and the nutrient diffusion barrier inherent to these scaffold materials. Disclosed embodiments introduce a method to promote oxygen diffusion throughout the printed constructs using genetically encoded gas vesicles derived from haloarchaea. These hollow nanostructures are comprised of a protein shell that allows gases to permeate freely while excluding the water flow. After printing cells with gas vesicles of various concentrations, the cells are observed to have increased activity and proliferation. These results suggest that air-filled gas vesicles can help overcome the diffusion barrier throughout the 3D bioprinted constructs by increasing oxygen availability to cells within the center of the construct. The biodegradable nature of the gas vesicle proteins combined with the disclosed promising results permits their potential use as oxygen-promoting materials in biological samples.

In one embodiment, gas vesicle nanoparticles (GVNPs) are used to promote the oxygen diffusion within 3D tissue constructs.

Gas vesicles are hollow gas-filled proteinaceous intracellular organelles common to many species of bacteria and archaea 18. In nature, gas vesicles promote floatation and the availability of oxygen in the microbial cell19. These cylindrical- or spindle-shaped organelles have conical ends and vary in size depending on the organism20, 21. Over the years, gas vesicle nanoparticles have drawn interest in biotechnological and biomedical applications. This includes traditional nanoparticle applications as drug delivery systems and other applications based on their unique physical properties. It has been discovered that gas vesicles possess sound scattering properties and have the ability to produce harmonic ultrasound signals. One pioneering use of GVNPs is as novel contrast agents and molecular sensors for ultrasound and magnetic resonance besides others22-27.

In one embodiment, a new, efficient system for haloarchaeal Haloferax volcanii gas vesicle expression is developed. The system utilizes a combination of attributes, such as moderate temperature, fast and elevated cell growth, no requirement for antibiotics), to facilitate cheaper and faster GVNP production at yields high enough to be suitable for bioreactor scale22, 28.

In one embodiment, gas vesicles are printed homogeneously throughout the 3D tissue constructs, to improve cell growth by promoting the diffusion of oxygen.

In one embodiment, the bioprinting of gas vesicles is conducted with a 3D bioprinting system designed for ultra-short peptide hydrogels29-33, wherein the printability of peptide bioinks and biocompatibility with various cell types was confirmed to be high34, 35.

In FIG. 9, * indicates p<0.05, while *** indicates p<0.001 The differences in cell proliferation was compared between the 3D control and cells cultured with GVNPs using student's t-test and the p values are summarized below:

### 3D Bioprinting Process

In one embodiment, various shapes are printed using IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) to optimize printing parameters, including peptide and PBS flow rates.

In one embodiment, the rapid gelation of the IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) facilitate smooth and consistent extrusion of the bioink, thus achieving a more refined and stable construct of 10 mm in height. The construct of 10 mm height formed with IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) is shown in FIG. 10. In FIG. 10, the left panel shows cylinder printed with IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) on day 1, while the right panel shows the same construct after 8 weeks.

In one embodiment, IK6 peptide has high degree of bioprintability, structure fidelity, and cell viability45.

In one embodiment, the stability of the bioprinted construct with IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) is high enough to maintain high degree of construct fidelity during the incubation period of several weeks.

In one embodiment, the construct maintained structure and hold shape, after 8 weeks, thus confirming the high structure fidelity of the IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1).

In one embodiment, the gas vesicles are suitable for bioprinting.

In one embodiment, the optimal printing parameters of bioprinting using gas vesicles are determined.

Previous studies find that gas vesicles are relatively weak and their strength varies depending on the organism and strain from which they are derived19, 21. However, in one embodiment, the gas vesicles may withstand the stress of the 3D printing process.

In one embodiment, the morphology of the printed gas vesicles is c compared to those that were not printed. Analysis of these images via SEM imaging, confirming that the gas vesicles remained intact and maintained their structural integrity throughout the printing process. The SEM images are shown in FIG. 11. In FIG. 11, the left panel shows photo of printed peptide scaffold with GVNPs obtained at 35,000× magnification, while the right panel shows that obtained at 100,000× magnification.

In one embodiment, the addition of gas vesicles can improve oxygen availability to cells within the center of printed constructs.

In one embodiment, optimal gas vesicle distribution within the samples is determined.

In one embodiment, gas vesicle distributes homogenously throughout the construct.

### Morphological Study of Bioprinted Cells

In one embodiment, cell aggregates form within gels after printing. In one embodiment, the cells proliferate within gels after printing The actin cytoskeletons and nuclei of these cell aggregates were stained, as shown in FIG. 15. In FIG. 15 the growth of the cell aggregates was tracked for 7 days. The growing size of the cellular aggregates over time is evidence for cell proliferation. In FIG. 15, the nucleus are shown in blue, F-actin in red and the scale bar is 50 μm.

In one embodiment, the GVNPs in the gel construct after printing are visualized using microscopy imaging. These images depicting the GVNPs in the environment surrounding the cells 2 and 8 days after printing are shown in FIG. 16. This is contrasted with the lack of gas vesicles present in the imaged control samples. In FIG. 16, the scale bar is 5 μm.

In one embodiment, a new plasmid construct allowing fast and high-yielding GVNPs production in Haloferax volcanii without the requirement of antibiotics is provided. In one embodiment, Haloferax volcanii is completely sequenced and has clean genetic background with respect to gas vesicle genes, making it a suitable and attractive organism of choice for expressing Halobacterium gas vesicle nanoparticles. H. volcanii is a nonpathogenic halophile that grows to high density in the presence of high concentrations of salt, which precludes contamination by less halophilic microorganisms42, 46. In one embodiment, the S-layer cell walls of H. volcanii is fragile enough to be easily lysed upon addition of water, releasing cellular proteins and reducing the cost of protein purification47, 48, which also makes it attractive feature for biotechnological and biomedical applications.

In one embodiment, the Superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) is displayed on the GVNPs surface, which demonstrated the application of GVNPs as imaging tools and oxygen carriers as well as protein display and delivery vehicle.

In one embodiment, the protein expression system and purification process are straightforward and efficient enough to produce a substantial number of gas vesicles that can be scaled.

In one embodiment, the GVNPs has a spindle or cylindrical shape, which increases volume to surface area ratio. The increased volume to surface area ratio allows improved gas exchange and nutrient diffusion.

In one embodiment, the diameter/width of the gas vesicles ranging from 60-200 nm is also ideal for biomedical applications. GVNPs are small enough to fit within the pores of the fibrous extracellular matrix of hydrogels while still too large to cross the blood-brain barrier and cell membrane49.

The biocompatibility of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 gas vesicles in 2D cell culture was studied22. In one embodiment, gas vesicles expressed in Haloferax volcanii has high biocompatibility, as confirmed by 3D cell culture of HEK 293 cells with various concentrations of GVNPs. In one embodiment, the gas vesicles have no associated toxicity, as indicated by the qualitative and quantitative assessment concerning cell growth, morphology, and proliferation.

In one embodiment, the bioink and gas vesicles survives the stress associated with the printing process. In one embodiment, comparison of the imaged printed and manually prepared peptide bioink samples confirmed that the peptide maintained its ability to self-assemble into helical fibers and form supramolecular structures, despite the shear stress imposed by the printing.

In one embodiment, the versatility of the printing system shown in FIG. 17 is suitable for the use of ultrashort self-assembling peptide as bioink material and the incorporation of gas vesicles in the constructs.

In one embodiment, nearly all of the 3D printed gas vesicles remained intact, thereby providing further evidence of the strength of halophilic gas vesicles and suggesting potential applications of gas vesicles for biomedical applications.

In one embodiment, recombinant GVNPs are stable for several months at room temperature and at elevated temperatures of around 50° C., with little to no degradation27.

In one embodiment, these protein-based nanostructures can promote the growth of printed cells, which is crucial to preserve cell viability, morphology, and function after printing 54-57. Previous studies have reported that the stress induced by the printing process may harm the cells57, 58. However, the extent of this cellular damage may differ according to cell type and the printing procedure.

In one embodiment, in the case of 3D bioprinter using the configuration shown in FIG. 17, the printing procedure could be modified by adjusting syringe pump flow rates, inner diameters of the nozzle, printing speed, and layer height.

In one embodiment, the 3D bioprinting parameters are optimized for HEK 293 cells and incorporated the GVNPs into the 3D construct, which were mitigated such that cell viability, proliferation, and morphology were improved.

The notion that cell growth and death are very strongly affected by the extracellular environment has been well documented in the literature59. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to tissue engineering, as it dictates cellular morphology and guides the connections between cells and the site of interactions. Together, the ECM architecture and its composition affect cell growth, connection, differentiation, and adhesion. In one embodiment, the GVNPs were able to incorporate within the peptide fibers. The gas vesicles were also able to stay within the extracellular environment for at least 8 days, increase the porosity of the gel constructs, and thereby allow more medium and nutrients to penetrate the center.

In one embodiment, the GVNPs are able to influence the ECM without directly affecting the morphology of the HEK293 cells, as shown in FIGS. 13, 15 and 16.

In one embodiment, the cells printed with GVNPs show better viability than the cells printed without GVNPs. As the GVNPs constitute the thin protein-membrane and the gases inside and are permeable to gases in the environment, the effect is likely due to the gas permeability of the protein shell. One way, through which this can occur, is by promoting the availability of oxygen to the cells, as the oxygen is allowed to diffuse from within the gas vesicles to the surrounding environment. In one embodiment, the increased oxygen availability may render the environment more similar to favorable in vivo conditions, thereby promoting cell survival. In another embodiment, nearby GVNPs enable cells to clear waste or other species within the environment more rapidly. Byproducts of cellular respiration include CO2. Therefore, the permeability of the GVNP shell coupled with the concentration gradient of the different gases in the system may have promoted the diffusion of CO2 away from the cells.

In one embodiment, Gas vesicles are excellent materials for applications in medicine, due to their aforementioned advantages over other nanostructures. In another embodiment, these gas-filled stable protein nanostructures are uniquely well suited for bioengineering.

In one embodiment, the use of genetically encoded air-filled gas vesicles for 3D bioprinting is demonstrated for the first time. In one embodiment, the gas vesicles does not harm cell proliferation, despite its bacterial origination. In one embodiment, cell viability is promoted by the gas vesicles.

In one embodiment, the additional oxygen support is beneficial. This extra support is beneficial for the cells that are encapsulated within the center of the 3D printed construct and thus due to the diffusion barrier less accessible to nutrients. Thus, air-filled GVNPs that are printed together with living cells can counterbalance stress factors which the cells are experiencing during and after 3D printing.

In one embodiment, promoting viability of bioprinted cells with the addition of GVNPs facilitates the 3D printing of large tissues and organs.

In one embodiment, using gas vesicles in tissue engineering applications enhances the proliferation of mammalian cells in 3D cultures. In one embodiment, the gas vesicles can withstand the stress associated with the bioprinting process and positively influence cell viability suggest that this method can promote the survival of cells within 3D printed constructs. In one embodiment, the gas vesicles can be used as a suitable and easy-to-prepare tool to promote cell viability during tissue construct formation and can serve as an oxygen place holder during nascent vascularization approaches.

Having described the many embodiments of the present disclosure in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that all examples in the present disclosure, while illustrating many embodiments of the invention, are provided as non-limiting examples and are, therefore, not to be taken as limiting the various aspects so illustrated.

sfGFP synthetic gene (IDT®, Leuven, Belgium) was codon-optimized using the java codon adaptation online tool JCat for Halobacterium sp. (strain NRC-1/ATCC 700922/JCM 11081)40. The gas vesicle operon from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 was amplified from the genome by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and cloned with sfGFP via FspAI-HpaI and HpaI-BamHI using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit into plasmid vector pTA963 to generate the pTA963_sfGFP_GVNPs expression plasmid (Table 1). The construct was validated by restriction digestion using FspAI, HpaI, and BamHI, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. Gas vesicles containing the vector were transformed into Haloferax volcanii H1895 using the PEG/EDTA method41

### Example 3

**Culturing and Gas Vesicle Preparation**

The processes for producing and culturing gas vesicles were performed as previously described 19, 22, 42. Briefly, H. volcanii lawns or floating cells were lysed osmotically with PBS solution [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, and 2 mM potassium phosphate monobasic (pH 7.4)] containing 10 mM MgSO4 and 20 μg/mL of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich®, USA). The cell lysate suspension was incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. before overnight centrifugation at 60 g in a swinging bucket rotor in an Allegra® X-15R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter®, CA, USA) to accelerate floatation of the gas vesicles. Intact gas vesicles were collected and re-suspended in PBS solution, then floated by overnight centrifugation and harvested again. This floatation procedure was repeated until a white, milky suspension of gas vesicles was obtained. Gas vesicle concentration was quantified via NanoDrop® 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific®, Waltham, Mass., USA) by measuring a small sample of gas vesicles broken by sonicating for several minutes.

### Example 4

**Hydrogel Preparation**

The ultrashort peptide IK6 (Ac-ILVAGK-NH2) (SEQ ID No. 1) used in this study was synthesized by Bachem® AG (Budendorf, Switzerland) using solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified to above 95% via HPLC. Amino acid and peptide content analysis were performed. The lyophilized peptide powders were first dissolved in Milli-Q® water and mixed by vortexing for 30 seconds to obtain a homogenous solution. Then, 10× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to the peptide solution for a final concentration of 1×. Gelation occurred within a few minutes at 8 mg/mL peptide concentration.

### Example 5

**Cell Culture in 2D**

HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC® (USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM-HG), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS, Gibco®) at 37° C. with 5% CO2. The cells were subcultured with trypsin at approximately 80% confluence. The culture media was changed every 2-3 days. Cells at passages 6-8 were encapsulated for 3D culture and monolayer culture.

### Example 6

**Cell Culture in 3D**

HEK293 cells were cultured in 75 T flasks and incubated in a CO2 incubator maintained at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Culture media was replaced every 48 hours until the cells reached 80% confluency. Confluent cells were subcultured, and cells at passages 6-8 were used for the study. For the 3D culture, the peptide was sterilized by exposure to UV light for 30 minutes. 10,000 cells in 2× PBS were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with peptide solution and used to prepare 100 μl of 3D construct in a 96 well-plate without the addition of GVNPs to serve as a control. Different concentrations of GVNPs were obtained by mixing with PBS before adding them to form 3D samples. This allowed for the evaluation of the GVNPs effect on cell proliferation.

### Example 7

**3D Bioprinting**

16 mM of IK6 peptide (SEQ ID No. 1) was diluted in 1 mL of MilliQ® water, mixed well, and sonicated to assure a homogenous solution. Eight million cells were suspended in 1× PBS without GVNPs (control). When printing with GVNPs, the cells were mixed with a 1× PBS solution containing GVNPs at a 300 μg/ml concentration.

A custom-designed 3D bioprinter along with commercial microfluidic pumps was set up, and a homemade dual coaxial nozzle was used for bioink extrusion32, 33, 43. Structures were printed in the shape of a rectangular prism with a length, width, and height of 10 mm, 10 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively. Illustrated figure of the printed structure along with the printer setup is shown in FIG. 17. A preview of the gcode file of the printed structure with dimensions measuring 10 mm×10 mm×1.5 mm is shown in FIG. 18. To facilitate imaging, the structure was printed onto an 18×18 mm glass coverslip. The glass coverslip was then placed on top of a heat-bed set to 40° C. to create a suitable temperature environment for the cells.

Three syringe pumps were set up to dispense homogenous gel and extrude peptide bioink through the nozzle. The first syringe pump was loaded with peptide solution and set to a flow rate of 55 μl/min. The second pump was loaded with 7× PBS and set to a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The third pump was loaded with the cells and set to a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Three samples of the 4-layer rectangular prism were printed for each condition with a height of 1.5 mm per sample to facilitate imaging. The same procedure was conducted for samples without gas vesicles to serve as controls.

### Example 8

**3D Cell Proliferation Assay**

The CellTiter-Glo® luminescent 3D cell viability assay was used to assess cell proliferation in 3D hydrogels by measuring ATP production. At each time point, the kit was equilibrated at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. CellTiter-Glo® Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium present in each well was added. The contents were mixed for 5 minutes to digest the hydrogels and then incubated for 30 minutes. After incubation, the luminescence was recorded using a plate reader (PHERAstar® FS, Germany).

### Example 9

**Live/Dead Staining**

HEK293 cells were seeded into peptide according to the protocol described in Example 6 above. After one, three, and seven days of incubation, the media was removed and replaced with PBS solution containing staining solution approximately 2 mM calcein AM and 4 mM ethidium homodimer-1 (staining solution) prior to incubation for 40 minutes. Before imaging, the staining solution was removed, and fresh PBS was added. Stained cells were imaged under an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss® LSM 710 Inverted Confocal Microscope, Germany). The percentage of living cells was obtained through analysis with ImageJ.

**Example 10**

**Cytoskeletal Staining and Imaging**

Immunostaining was performed at each culture time point. In brief, the cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution for 30 minutes and incubated in a cold cytoskeleton buffer (3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose, and 0.5%, v/v Triton X-100 in PBS solution) for 5 minutes to permeabilize the cell membranes. The permeabilized cells were then incubated in blocking buffer solution (5% FBS, 0.1%, v/v Tween-20, and 0.02%, w/v sodium azide in PBS) for 30 minutes at 37° C. For F-Actin, anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-FITC and rhodamine-phalloidin (1:300) were added to the cells for 1 hour. Further, the cells were incubated in DAPI for five minutes to counterstain the nucleus. The fluorescent dye-treated cells were observed and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss® LSM 710 Inverted Confocal).

**Example 11**

**Scanning Electron Microscopy**

The printed samples were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to visualize the morphology of the peptide bioink and gas vesicles in printed samples43. Samples were printed on 18×18 mm glass coverslips and given time to solidify before dehydration by gradual immersion in increasing concentrations of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% (v/v) ethanol solutions for 5 min in each solution. Further dehydration in 100% ethanol solution was done by changing the absolute ethanol solution with a fresh ethanol solution twice for 5 min each, followed by a third time for 2 hours. Dehydrated samples were subsequently placed into the critical point dryer (Sorvall Critical Point Drying System) for evaporation before being mounted onto SEM aluminum pin stubs with double-stick conductive carbon tape and a final sputter coating of 10 nm of iridium. Images were taken with FEI Magellan XHR SEM. This was done with a TLD detector, and imaging parameters included a current of 50 pA, a high voltage of 3.00 kV, and a working distance of 4.0 m. Biological peptide hydrogel coating cells were fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (diluted from 25%) in water overnight at 4° C., the post-fixation was done by 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PBS for one hour in the dark followed by washing 3 times by ddH2O. This was followed by serial dehydration with 10 mL of H2O (twice), 25% ethanol, 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and 100% (v/v) ethanol (twice). Samples in ethanol were then critically point dried using liquid CO2 (Sorvall Critical Point Drying System).

**Statistical Analysis**

All experimental approaches were executed in triplicates to allow for statistical testing. Results are represented as mean±standard deviation, n≥3. The differences observed in HEK293 cell behavior for conditions with and without GVNPs were compared. Statistical analysis was performed by a student's t-test, and values with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
