    "abstract": "A method for predicting survival rates of a prospective organ recipient is disclosed. The method may include receiving a first dataset that includes characteristics of previous persons in need of a transplant that received or did not receive the organ transplant and their respective actual survival rates. The method may further include receiving a second dataset that includes characteristics of a prospective organ recipient and characteristics of a donor organ available for an organ transplant into the prospective organ recipient. The method may then calculate the estimated survival rates over a predetermined of the prospective organ recipient based on whether the prospective organ recipient has the organ transplanted. Next, a graph may be generated showing the estimated survival rates of the prospective organ recipient based on whether the prospective organ recipient receives and does not receive the organ transplant, which may be displayed a graphical user interface.",

                        "Presently, over 100,000 people in the United States are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. Clearly, the demand for organs greatly exceeds the available number of organs available. As a result, over 20 people per day die in the United States while waiting on an organ transplant. In instances where organs are received from a recently deceased donor, there are usually only hours before the organs must be transplanted. Because of this, recipients must be determined quickly, and those recipients must quickly accept a donor organ with little time to analyze several considerations. Some considerations that a prospective recipient might want to consider include: whether the organ is an infectious risk donor (IRD) organ (e.g., donor died of an overdose, donor had hepatitis C, etc.); chances of surviving the procedure; life expectancy with the organ transplant; and/or whether foregoing the organ in favor of another organ would be more beneficial.",
                        "During extremely time-sensitive moments, customized survival rates may assist prospective recipients in their decision to accept or deny the organ. Also, the customized survival rates may help medical personnel in more efficiently selecting and contacting prospective recipients on the organ transplant waitlist. Further, by better informing prospective organ recipients of the survival rates of a specific organ, IRD organs that are often discarded, may be used, which may provide a dual benefit; a reduction to the organ transplant waitlist and a healthy organ for the prospective recipient.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need for an improved system and method for providing prospective recipient specific estimated survival rates of an organ transplant."

Consistent with the disclosed embodiments, the methods may include one or more processors, transceivers, computing devices, user devices, or databases. One exemplary method may include calculating multiple estimated survival rates (e.g., a first and second set of estimated survival rates) for the prospective organ recipient. The method may include the computing device receiving a first dataset that includes characteristics of previous prospective organ transplant recipients, characteristics of previous persons in need of an organ transplant that did not receive the organ transplant, a first set of actual survival rates of the previous prospective organ transplant recipients, and/or a second set of actual survival rates of the previous persons in need of an organ transplant that did not receive the organ transplant.",

The first set of estimated survival rates may be based on the organ recipient foregoing the organ transplant with the first organ. Further, based on at least a portion of the first dataset and at least a portion of the second dataset, the method may include calculating a second set of estimated survival rates of the prospective organ recipient over the predetermined time periods. Here, the second set of estimated survival rates may be based on the organ recipient receiving the organ transplant with the first organ. Once calculated, the method may include generating a first graph of the first and second set of estimated survival rates of the prospective organ recipient over the predetermined periods. The method may also include displaying the first graph as a graphical user interface on the computing device.",

Similarly, the characteristics of the previous organs received by the previous prospective organ transplant recipients may include certain characteristics of a donor of the organ including the donor's age, gender, blood type, height, weight, a medical condition (e.g., sickle cell disease), medical history, family medical history, ethnicity, race, current medical condition, and/or the like. Further, the characteristics of the previous organs received by the previous prospective organ transplant recipients may include an organ type (e.g., a heart, kidneys, lungs, liver, etc.). The organ type may further include a status of whether the organ is infection-risk disease (IRD) or non-IRD. An organ may be classified as IRD when the donor recently injected drugs, was incarcerated, had sexual intercourse for drugs or money, or of course had an infectious disease such as hepatitis C or HIV.",

This may include the computing device 110 comparing the characteristics of the prospective organ transplant recipient and the characteristics of previous persons in need of an organ transplant that did not receive the organ transplant for at least partial congruence. For instance, a 55-year-old woman, who is 5\u20322\u2033, weighs 125 lbs, and needs a kidney may be congruent with previous women over 50 years of age, between 5\u20320\u2033 and 5\u20325\u2033, weighing between 110 and 140 lbs, and who were in need of kidney, but did not receive the donor organ. Of course, in determining congruence, each of the characteristics may be weighted differently or each may have the same value.",
                        "Next, the computing device 110 may identify, from the first dataset, the second set of actual survival rates of the congruent women that did not receive the organ transplant. The actual survival rates of these women who survived without the donor organ may be an average, and/or may be categorized by a predetermined time period, for example, the computing device 110 may determine that 80% of these women survived at least two years without the donor organ, that only 50% of these women survived four years without the donor organ, that only 20% of these women survived over six years without the donor organ, and that no woman lived over ten years without the donor organ. Using this information, the computing device 110 may also analyze data from the second dataset such as an estimated wait time for a second donor organ to become available for transplant. Therefore, if the prospective organ donor recipient decides to forego the organ transplant, for example, because the organ is an IRD organ, the computing device 110 may determine the likelihood (e.g., 30% chance of survival) of the prospective organ donor recipient surviving over the estimated wait time for the second organ. Further, the computing device 110 may determine the first set of estimated survival rates\u2014i.e., the likelihood of the prospective organ donor recipient surviving over other periods (e.g., one year, two years, five years, ten years, etc.).",
