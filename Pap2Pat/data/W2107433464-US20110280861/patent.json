    "date": "2009-08-10 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Embodiments of the invention relate to methods and compositions for the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self renewal. The microRNA-125a is a master control of HSC self-renewal. Increased expression of mir-125a increased HSC self-renewal by 6-30 folds. Increased expression of mir-125a can be used to expand HSC ex vivo and in vivo.",

                        "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are stem cells that give rise to all the blood cell types including myeloid (monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes/platelets, dendritic cells), and lymphoid lineages (T-cells, B-cells, NK-cells).",
                        "As stem cells, they are defined by their ability to form multiple cell types (multipotency) and their ability to self-renew. It is known that a small number of HSCs can expand to generate a very large number of progeny HSCs. This phenomenon is used in bone marrow transplant when a small number of HSCs reconstitute the hematopoietic system. The ability to self-renew and differentiate to form all blood cells provides a constant supply of blood cells throughout animal life. The supply is need for replacing old, worn out or dead blood cells in the body.",
                        "However, there are instances when HSC self renewal is or becomes severely impaired due to genetic disorders, diseases, illness, medical treatment and/or environmental effects. The affected individual cannot supply blood cells for replacing old, worn out or dead blood cells in the body, becomes deficient in life sustaining blood cells, consequently becomes susceptible to infections and has to be dependent on a life time of blood transfusion for the replacement of blood cells in the body. There is a need for new innovations that can boost or recover HSC self renewal capability."

If the alignments are done based on the nucleotide sequences, then the selected genes should be analyzed to determine which genes of that subset have the closest amino acid homology to the originating species antibody. It is contemplated that amino acid sequences or gene sequences which approach a higher degree homology as compared to other sequences in the database can be utilized and manipulated in accordance with the procedures described herein. Moreover, amino acid sequences or genes which have lesser homology can be utilized when they encode products which, when manipulated and selected in accordance with the procedures described herein, exhibit specificity for the predetermined target antigen.

Expression of miR-125a, as a transgene, is necessary and sufficient to expand the numbers of HSC cell division by at least 10 fold without any loss of multi-lineage differentiation potential in the progenies of the expansion. However, in the more mature, lineage committed cells, expression of miR-125a alone is not sufficient to induce self-renewal in these cells.",
                                "MicroRNAs are known to influence lineage fate in hematopoiesis, however little is known about their participation in the stem cell state. Here the inventors report that conditional deletion of the small RNA processing enzyme, Dicer, in adult hematopoietic tissues markedly affected the multipotent primitive population in a cell autonomous manner. Among closely related primitive hematopoietic cells, the stem cell enriched compartment displayed distinctive, exquisite sensitivity to Dicer loss. The inventors identified multiple differentially expressed microRNAs including miR-99b, let-7e and miR-125a that are highly conserved and organize as a 620 base-pair (bp) cluster on mouse chromosome 17. This cluster increased the reconstituting capacity of bone marrow, an effect that could be recapitulated by miR-125a alone. MiR125a increased stem cell number and increased the reconstitution ability of stem cells by \u02dc10-fold without differentiation blockade. However, miR-125a was not sufficient to induce self-renewal in non-stem cells. Taken together, these data indicate differentiation stage specific dependence for microRNA processing to sustain cell persistence in hematopoiesis and cell state specific capacity for specific microRNA to amplify self-renewal.",
                                "HSC self-renew and differentiate to form all blood cells throughout animal life. Adult tissues are comprised of a large number of terminally differentiated effector cells and a much smaller number of long-lived progenitor/stem cells that constantly replenish the pool of the former to maintain tissue homeostasis and repair tissue injury. MicroRNAs, emerging as a class of important cellular regulators, are gaining appreciation as mediators of cell state with specific patterns of microRNA expression demarcating developmental or differentiation stage. These small non-coding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and processed by RNases Drosha and Dicer to the mature \u02dc22 nucleotide (nt) form. In the blood system, multiple microRNAs have been found to direct the differentiation of each of the major blood lineages, e.g. miR-181 for T cell differentiation, miR-150 for B cell maturation and miR-223 for granulopoiesis. MiR-150, in particular, has been shown to shunt the fate choice of megakaryocyte and erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) toward megakaryocytes and away from erythrocytes. Self-renewal can be viewed as one of the unique fate options possessed by stem cells, occupying the very early stages in the blood development program.",
                                "Disrupting Dicer in developing mouse embryos causes early lethality with an absence of pluripotent stem cells in the embryo remnants. To assess the role of Dicer in maintaining adult HSCs, the inventors utilized a conditional Dicer allele where the Dicer gene can be efficiently inactivated in the hematopoietic tissue. Specifically, a single microRNA within this cluster, miR-125a, positively regulates the self-renewal ability of HSCs, but is insufficient to induce self-renewal in more mature cells.",
                                "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 18-24 nt non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that exist in a variety of organisms, including mammals, and are conserved in evolution. miRNAs are transcribed as 5\u2032-capped large polyadenylated transcripts (pri-miRNA), primarily in a Pol II-dependent manner. Approximately 40% of human miRNAs are co-transcribed as clusters encoding up to eight distinct miRNA sequences in a single pri-microRNA transcript. Many miRNAs can be encoded in intergenic regions, hosted within introns of pre-mRNAs or within ncRNA genes. Many miRNAs also tend to be clustered and transcribed as polycistrons and often have similar spatial temporal expression patterns. MiRNAs have been found to have roles in a variety of biological processes including developmental timing, differentiation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, organ development, and metabolism (Kloosterman, et al., 2006, Dev. Cell 11:441-50, and Krutzfeldt, et al., 2006, Cell. Metab. 4:9-12). Furthermore, miRNAs have been implicated in diseases such as cancer (Esquela-Kerscher, et al., 2006, Nat. Rev. Cancer 6:259-69) and hepatitis C (Jopling, et al., 2005, Science, 309:1577-81), which make them attractive new drug targets. In contrast to the widely used RNAi technology using small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, strategies to inhibit miRNAs have been less well investigated. Reverse-complement 2\u2032-O-methyl sugar modified RNA is frequently being used to block miRNA function in cell-based systems (Krutzfeldt, et al., 2006, Nat. Genet. 38:S14-9).",

The resulting 60-70 nucleotide hairpin structure (pre-miRNA) encodes for a single miRNA sequence that is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Exportin5 in a Ran-GTP dependent manner. Cytoplasmic pre-miRNAs are further cleaved, by another RNaseIII-nuclease, Dicer in concert with cofactors (TRBP and PACT in humans), to remove the loop sequence forming a short-lived asymmetric duplex intermediate (miRNA: miRNA*). The microRNA: microRNA* duplex is in turn loaded into the miRISC complex in which Argonaut (Ago) proteins appear to be the key effector molecules. The strand that becomes the active mature microRNA appears to be dependent upon which has the lowest free energy 5\u2032 end and the other strand is degraded by an unknown nuclease.",

Restoration of miR-125a impaired tumor cell growth and reduced tumor cell migration and invasion, demonstrating miR-125 functions as a tumor suppressor. Ectopic expression of miR-125a in the ERBB2 dependent human breast cancer line, SKBR3, caused suppression of its anchorage-dependent growth and inhibition of its mobility and invasive capabilities. Ectopic expression miR-125a in non-transformed and ERBB2-independent MCF10a cells produced inhibitory effects on its anchorage-dependent growth and no significant impact on the mobility of these non-invasive human breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, miR-125a targets, ERBB2 and ERBB3, were downregulated when miR-125a is expressed in SKBR3 cells, and downregulation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 decreased the motility and invasiveness features of SKBR3 cells.",

The LNA modification leads to the thermodynamically strongest duplex formation with complementary RNA known. Consequently, a biological activity is often attained with very short LNA oligonucleotides. For example, an 8 nt fully-modified LNA oligomer complementary to a structural loop inhibited 50% of self-splicing of group I introns from rRNA genes in pathogenic organisms whereas DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were ineffective. Short fully-modified LNA oligonucleotides designed against telomerase were active in cellular assays, compared to mismatched negative controls. Furthermore, LNAs display excellent mismatch discrimination. Mouritzen et al. (Expert Rev Mol Diagn 2003; 3: 27-38) showed single-nucleotide specificity against complementary DNA using fully modified 12 nucleotide LNA probes coupled to glass slides during the development of a microarray used to probe samples for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human dysmetabolic syndrome.

                                "Stem cells can obtained from the bone marrow by repeated aspirations of the posterior iliac crests of a stem donor under general or local anesthesia. A patient's own stem cell can also be collected for ex vivo expansion. Adverse effects are generally rare and include discomfort at the harvesting site that typically lasts 1-2 weeks. This can be a difficult procedure in donors who are smaller than the recipient, such as sibling donors, and several aspirations may be required for an adequate mononuclear cell dose.",
                                "Bone marrow primed with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim [NEUPOGEN\u00ae]) has been used both in pediatric and adult patients to increase the stem cell count and thus reduce the number of aspirations from the donor and speed engraftment in the recipient. Filgrastim and chemotherapy can be used alone or in combination to mobilize stem cells.",
                                "Stem cells in the bone marrow can be mobilized into the peripheral blood and then collected. For patient having undergone a cycle of chemotherapy, they are allowed to recover for a period before stem cells are collected, and their number can be increased by using hematopoietic growth factors like G-CSF. Along with increasing the number of cells, G-CSF also causes the release of proteases that degrade the proteins that anchor the stem cells to the marrow stroma, causing their release into the peripheral blood. Recent literature has shown that combination of G-CSF and AMD3100, an inhibitor of chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), is superior to G-CSF alone in mobilizing stem cells.",
                                "Alternatively, HSCs can be obtained from circulating blood. Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become the preferred source of hematopoetic stem cells for allogeneic and autologous transplantation because of technical ease of collection and shorter time required for engraftment. As used herein, the term \u201cprogenitor\u201d cell refers to an immature or undifferentiated cell, typically found in post-natal animals. Progenitor cells can be unipotent or multipotent. Traditionally, G-CSF has been used to stimulate more PBPC and release of HSCs from the bone marrow. Although regimens using G-CSF usually succeed in collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors, 5%-10% will mobilize stem cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or bone marrow harvesting.",
                                "The dosage of G-CSF dose is 5-20 mcg/kg/day. In most regimens, 10 mcg/kg/day is used until harvesting. After mobilization, an apheresis machine collects the cells. Two ports of venous access are necessary to allow for continuous blood processing. In most adults, venous access is accomplished by using 2 antecubital lines. In 5-10% of adults and in most children, percutaneous antecubital large-bore access is not possible, and an apheresis catheter is used instead. Apheresis catheters can be used in children as light as 10 kg. Lighter children generally require a femoral catheter.",
                                "The WBC count, or the CD34 count, in the peripheral blood determines the timing of collection. CD34 is a cell surface marker on HSCs. Studies have shown a good correlation between the CD34 count in the peripheral blood and the number of cells harvested. The recommended CD34 count is 20-50 cells/\u03bcL of blood.",
                                "Collected stem cells are counted by flow cytometric analysis. Although the minimum number required for engraftment is considered to be 1\u00d7106 cells per kilogram of body weight, the preferred number is 2-2.5\u00d7106 cells/kg. Most people prefer to have a collection goal of 5-10\u00d7106 cells/kg to freeze the extra cells for potential future use.",
                                "Peripheral-blood stem cells can be cryopreserved for infusion months to years after collection.",
                                "AMD3100 is a bicyclam compound that inhibits the binding of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 is present on CD34+ HSCs and its interaction with SDF-1 plays a pivotal role in the homing of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow. Inhibition of the CXCR4-SDF1 axis by AMD3100 releases CD34+ cells into the circulation, which can then be collected easily by apheresis. Recently, a published report demonstrated that large numbers of CD34+ cells were rapidly mobilized in healthy volunteers following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100.",
                                "The HSCs can be isolated fresh and then frozen as the mononuclear cells of peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow using its pan-hematopoietic antigen CD34 or by other methods that are known to one skilled in the art.

Restriction enzyme sites can be designed and incorporated at the ends of the eventual duplex to facilitate ligating the duplex into a vector.",

Subcloning should be unidirectional such that the 5\u2032 transcription start nucleotide of the nuclei acid sequence is downstream of the promoter in the expression vector. Alternatively, when the nucleic acid sequence is cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO\u00ae, pENTR/SD/D-TOPO\u00ae (directional entry vectors), or any of the INVITROGEN\u2122's GATEWAY\u00ae Technology pENTR (entry) vectors, the nucleic acid sequence can be transferred into the various GATEWAY\u00ae expression vectors (destination) for protein expression in host cells in one single recombination reaction. Some of the GATEWAY\u00ae destination vectors are designed for the constructions of baculovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), retrovirus, and lentiviruses, which upon infecting their respective host cells, facilitating ease of introducing the transgene into the host cells. The GATEWAY\u00ae Technology uses lambda phage-based site-specific recombination instead of restriction endonuclease and ligase to insert a gene of interest into an expression vector. The DNA recombination sequences (attL, attR, attB, and attP) and the LR and BP CLONASE\u2122 enzyme mixtures that mediate the lambda recombination reactions are the foundation of GATEWAY\u00ae Technology. Transferring a gene into a destination vector is accomplished in just two steps: Step 1: Clone the nucleic acid sequence of interest into an entry vector such as pENTR/D-TOPO\u00ae. Step 2: Mix the entry clone containing the nucleic acid sequence of interest in vitro with the appropriate GATEWAY\u00ae expression vector (destination vector) and GATEWAY\u00ae LR CLONASE\u2122 enzyme mix. There are GATEWAY\u00ae expression vectors for protein expression in E. coli, insect cells, mammalian cells, and yeast. Site-specific recombination between the att sites (attR\u00d7attL and attB\u00d7attP) generates an expression vector and a by-product. The expression vector contains the nucleic acid sequence of interest recombined into the destination vector backbone.

                                "As used herein, \u201ccryopreservation\u201d refers to the preservation of cells by cooling to low sub-zero temperatures, such as (typically) 77 K or \u2212196\u00b0 C. (the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). Cryopreservation also refers to storing the cells at a temperature between 0\u00b0-10\u00b0 C. in the absence of any cryopreservative agents. At these low temperatures, any biological activity, including the biochemical reactions that would lead to cell death, is effectively stopped. Cryoprotective agents are often used at sub-zero temperatures to preserve the cells from damage due to freezing at low temperatures or warming to room temperature.",
                                "In one embodiment, the invention provides a cryopreserved pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) a viable composition of a population of HSCs that has been expanded ex vivo; (for example, as disclosed herein by the methods of paragraphs L to Q) (b) an amount of cryopreservative sufficient for the cryopreservation of the expanded HSCs; and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.",
                                "Freezing is destructive to most living cells. Upon cooling, as the external medium freezes, cells equilibrate by losing water, thus increasing intracellular solute concentration. Below about 10\u00b0-15\u00b0 C., intracellular freezing will occur. Both intracellular freezing and solution effects are responsible for cell injury (Mazur, P., 1970, Science 168:939-949). It has been proposed that freezing destruction from extracellular ice is essentially a plasma membrane injury resulting from osmotic dehydration of the cell (Meryman, H. T., et al., 1977, Cryobiology 14:287-302).",
                                "Cryoprotective agents and optimal cooling rates can protect against cell injury. Cryoprotection by solute addition is thought to occur by two potential mechanisms: colligatively, by penetration into the cell, reducing the amount of ice formed; or kinetically, by decreasing the rate of water flow out of the cell in response to a decreased vapor pressure of external ice (Meryman, H. T., et al., 1977, Cryobiology 14:287-302). Different optimal cooling rates have been described for different cells. Various groups have looked at the effect of cooling velocity or cryopreservatives upon the survival or transplantation efficiency of frozen bone marrow cells or red blood cells (Lovelock, J. E. and Bishop, M. W. H., 1959, Nature 183:1394-1395; Ashwood-Smith, M. J., 1961, Nature 190:1204-1205; RoWe, A. W. and Rinfret, A. P., 1962, Blood 20:636; Rowe, A. W. and Fellig, J., 1962, Fed. Proc. 21:157; Rowe, A. W., 1966, Cryobiology 3(1):12-18; Lewis, J. P., et al., 1967, Transfusion 7(1):17-32; Rapatz, G., et al., 1968, Cryobiology 5(1):18-25; Mazur, P., 1970, Science 168:939-949; Mazur, P., 1977, Cryobiology 14:251-272; Rowe, A. W. and Lenny, L.

                                "The successful recovery of human bone marrow cells after long-term storage in liquid nitrogen has been described (1983, American Type Culture Collection, Quarterly Newsletter 3(4):1). In addition, stem cells in bone marrow were shown capable of withstanding cryopreservation and thawing without significant cell death, as demonstrated by the ability to form equal numbers of mixed myeloid-erythroid colonies in vitro both before and after freezing (Fabian, I., et al., 1982, Exp. Hematol 10:119-122). The cryopreservation and thawing of human fetal liver cells (Zuckerman, A. J., et al., 1968, J. Clin. Pathol. (London) 21(1):109-110), fetal myocardial cells (Robinson, D. M. and Simpson, J. F., 1971, In Vitro 6(5):378), neonatal rat heart cells (Alink, G. M., et al., 1976, Cryobiology 13:295-304), and fetal rat pancreases (Kemp, J. A., et al., 1978, Transplantation 26:260-264) have also been reported.",
                                "The injurious effects associated with freezing can be circumvented by (a) use of a cryoprotective agent, (b) control of the freezing rate, and (c) storage at a temperature sufficiently low to minimize degradative reactions.",
                                "Cryoprotective agents which can be used include but are not limited to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Lovelock, J. E. and Bishop, M. W. H., 1959, Nature 183:1394-1395; Ashwood-Smith, M. J., 1961, Nature 190:1204-1205), glycerol, polyvinylpyrrolidine (Rinfret, A. P., 1960, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 85:576), polyethylene glycol (Sloviter, H. A. and Ravdin, R. G., 1962, Nature 196:548), albumin, dextran, sucrose, ethylene glycol, i-erythritol, D-Sorbitol, D-mannitol (Rowe, A. W., et al., 1962, Fed. Proc. 21:157), D-sorbitol, i-inositol, D-lactose, choline chloride (Bender, M. A., et al., 1960, J. Appl. Physiol. 15:520), amino acids (Phan The Tran and Bender, M. A., 1960, Exp. Cell Res. 20:651), methanol, acetamide, glycerol monoacetate (Lovelock, J. E., 1954, Biochem. J. 56:265), and inorganic salts (Phan The Tran and Bender, M. A., 1960, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 104:388; Phan The Tran and Bender, M. A., 1961, in Radiobiology, Proceedings of the Third Australian Conference on Radiobiology, Ilbery, P. L. T., ed., Butterworth, London, p. 59). In a preferred embodiment, DMSO is used, a liquid which is nontoxic to cells in low concentration. Being a small molecule, DMSO freely permeates the cell and protects intracellular organelles by combining with water to modify its freezability and prevent damage from ice formation. Addition of plasma (e.g., to a concentration of 20-25%) can augment the protective effect of DMSO. After the addition of DMSO, cells should be kept at 0-4\u00b0 C. until freezing, since DMSO concentrations of about 1% are toxic at temperatures above 4\u00b0 C.",
                                "A controlled slow cooling rate is critical. Different cryoprotective agents (Rapatz, G., et al., 1968, Cryobiology 5(1):18-25) and different cell types have different optimal cooling rates (see e.g., Rowe, A. W. and Rinfret, A. P., 1962, Blood 20:636; Rowe, A. W., 1966, Cryobiology 3(1):12-18; Lewis, J. P., et al., 1967, Transfusion 7(1):17-32; and Mazur, P., 1970, Science 168:939-949 for effects of cooling velocity on survival of marrow-stem cells and on their transplantation potential). The heat of fusion phase where water turns to ice should be minimal. The cooling procedure can be carried out by use of, e.g., a programmable freezing device or a methanol bath procedure.",
                                "Programmable freezing apparatuses allow determination of optimal cooling rates and facilitate standard reproducible cooling. Programmable controlled-rate freezers such as Cryomed or Planar permit tuning of the freezing regimen to the desired cooling rate curve. For example, for marrow cells in 10% DMSO and 20% plasma, the optimal rate is 1\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 C./minute from 0\u00b0 C. to \u221280\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, this cooling rate can be used for the amniotic fluid derived HSCs of the invention described herein. The container holding the cells must be stable at cryogenic temperatures and allow for rapid heat transfer for effective control of both freezing and thawing. Sealed plastic vials (e.g., Nunc, Wheaton CRYULES\u00ae) or glass ampules can be used for multiple small amounts (1-2 ml), while larger volumes (100-200 ml) can be frozen in polyolefin bags (e.g., Delmed) held between metal plates for better heat transfer during cooling. (Bags of bone marrow cells have been successfully frozen by placing them in \u221280\u00b0 C. freezers which, fortuitously, gives a cooling rate of approximately 3\u00b0 C./minute).",
                                "In an alternative embodiment, the methanol bath method of cooling can be used. The methanol bath method is well-suited to routine cryopreservation of multiple small items on a large scale. The method does not require manual control of the freezing rate nor a recorder to monitor the rate. In a preferred aspect, DMSO-treated cells are pre-cooled on ice and transferred to a tray containing chilled methanol which is placed, in turn, in a mechanical refrigerator (e.g., Harris or Revco) at \u221280\u00b0 C. Thermocouple measurements of the methanol bath and the samples indicate the desired cooling rate of 1\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 C./minute. After at least two hours, the specimens have reached a temperature of \u221280\u00b0 C. and can be placed directly into liquid nitrogen (\u2212196\u00b0 C.) for permanent storage.",
                                "After thorough freezing, cells can be rapidly transferred to a long-term cryogenic storage vessel. In a preferred embodiment, the expanded HSCs can be cryogenically stored in liquid nitrogen (\u2212196\u00b0 C.) or its vapor (\u2212165\u00b0 C.). Such storage is greatly facilitated by the availability of highly efficient liquid nitrogen refrigerators, which resemble large Thermos containers with an extremely low vacuum and internal super insulation, such that heat leakage and nitrogen losses are kept to an absolute minimum",
                                "In a particular embodiment, the cryopreservation procedure described in Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology, 2007, (Mick Bhatia, et. al., ed., John Wiley and Sons, Inc.) is used and is hereby incorporated by reference. Mainly when the HSCs on a 10-cm tissue culture plate have reached approximately 50% confluency, the media within the plate is aspirated and the HSC s are rinsed with phosphate buffered saline. The adherent HSC are then detached by 3 ml of 0.025% trypsin/0.04% EDTA treatment. The trypsin/EDTA is neutralized by 7 ml of media and the detached HSC are collected by centrifugation at 200\u00d7g for 2 min. The supernatant is aspirated off and the pellet of HSCs is resuspended in 1.5 ml of media. An aliquot of 1 ml of 100% DMSO is added to the suspension of HSCs and gently mixed. Then 1 ml aliquots of this suspension of HSCs in DMSO are dispensed into CRYULES\u00ae in preparation for cryopreservation. The sterilized storage CRYULES\u00ae preferably have their caps threaded inside, allowing easy handling without contamination. Suitable racking systems are commercially available and can be used for cataloguing, storage, and retrieval of individual specimens.",

                                "Frozen HSCs are preferably thawed quickly (e.g., in a water bath maintained at 37\u00b0-41\u00b0 C.) and chilled on ice immediately upon thawing. In particular, the cryogenic vial containing the frozen HSCs can be immersed up to its neck in a warm water bath; gentle rotation will ensure mixing of the cell suspension as it thaws and increase heat transfer from the warm water to the internal ice mass. As soon as the ice has completely melted, the vial can be immediately placed in ice.",
                                "In a particular embodiment, the thawing procedure after cryopreservation is described in Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology 2007 (Mick Bhatia, et. al., ed., John Wiley and Sons, Inc.) and is hereby incorporated by reference. Immediately after removing the cryogenic vial from the cryo-freezer, the vial is rolled between the hands for 10 to 30 sec until the outside of the vial is frost free. The vial is then held upright in a 37\u00b0 C. water-bath until the contents are visibly thawed. The vial is immersed in 95% ethanol or sprayed with 70% ethanol to kill microorganisms from the water-bath and air dry in a sterile hood. The contents of the vial are then transferred to a 10-cm sterile culture containing 9 ml of media using sterile techniques. The HSCs can then be cultured and further expanded in a incubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% humidified CO2.",
                                "It may be desirable to treat the HSCs in order to prevent cellular clumping upon thawing. To prevent clumping, various procedures can be used, including but not limited to, the addition before and/or after freezing of DNase (Spitzer, G., et al., 1980, Cancer 45:3075-3085), low molecular weight dextran and citrate, hydroxyethyl starch (Stiff, P. J., et al., 1983, Cryobiology 20:17-24).",
                                "The cryoprotective agent, if toxic in humans, should be removed prior to therapeutic use of the thawed HSCs. In an embodiment employing DMSO as the cryopreservative, it is preferable to omit this step in order to avoid cell loss, since DMSO has no serious toxicity. However, where removal of the cryoprotective agent is desired, the removal is preferably accomplished upon thawing.",
                                "One way in which to remove the cryoprotective agent is by dilution to an insignificant concentration. This can be accomplished by addition of medium, followed by, if necessary, one or more cycles of centrifugation to pellet the cells, removal of the supernatant, and resuspension of the cells. For example, the intracellular DMSO in the thawed cells can be reduced to a level (less than 1%) that will not adversely affect the recovered cells. This is preferably done slowly to minimize potentially damaging osmotic gradients that occur during DMSO removal.",
                                "After removal of the cryoprotective agent, cell count (e.g., by use of a hemocytometer) and viability testing (e.g., by trypan blue exclusion; Kuchler, R. J. 1977, Biochemical Methods in Cell Culture and Virology, Dowden, Hutchinson & Ross, Stroudsburg, Pa., pp. 18-19; 1964, Methods in Medical Research, Eisen, H. N., et al., eds., Vol. 10, Year Book Medical Publishers, Inc., Chicago, pp. 39-47) can be done to confirm cell survival.",
                                "In a preferred, but not required, aspect of the invention, thawed cells are tested by standard assays of viability (e.g., trypan blue exclusion) and of microbial sterility as described herein, and tested to confirm and/or determine their identity relative to the recipient. In one embodiment, the viability of a thawed composition enriched in human amniotic fluid derived HSCs is at least 20% to at least 99%, and including all the percentages between 20-99%.",

G., et al., eds., DHEW Publication No. (NIH) 74-545, pp. 24-27), and DNA fingerprinting, which can be used to establish the genetic identity of the cells. DNA fingerprinting (Jeffreys, A. J., et al., 1985, Nature 314:67-73) exploits the extensive restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with hypervariable minisatellite regions of human DNA, to enable identification of the origin of a DNA sample, specific to each individual (Jeffreys, A.

Such long-circulating liposomes include a surface coat of flexible water soluble polymer chains, which act to prevent interaction between the liposome and the plasma components which play a role in liposome uptake. Alternatively, hyaluronan has been used as a surface coating to maintain long circulation.",
                                "In one embodiment, the liposomes encapsulate the nucleic acid sequences, vectors, agents or even the viral particles. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences, vectors or agents are condensed with a cationic polymer, e.g., PEI, polyamine spermidine, and spermine, or a cationic peptide, e.g., protamine and poly-lysine, and encapsulated in the lipid particle. The liposomes can comprise multiple layers assembled in a step-wise fashion.",
                                "Lipid materials are well known and routinely utilized in the art to produce liposomes. Lipids may include relatively rigid varieties, such as sphingomyelin, or fluid types, such as phospholipids having unsaturated acyl chains. \u201cPhospholipid\u201d refers to any one phospholipid or combination of phospholipids capable of forming liposomes. Phosphatidylcholines (PC), including those obtained from egg, soy beans or other plant sources or those that are partially or wholly synthetic or of variable lipid chain length and unsaturation are suitable for use in the present invention. Synthetic, semisynthetic and natural product phosphatidylcholines including, but not limited to, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), soy phosphatidylcholine (soy PC), egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC), hydrogenated egg phosphatidylcholine (HEPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) are suitable phosphatidylcholines for use in this invention. All of these phospholipids are commercially available. Further, phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and phosphatic acid (PA) are also suitable phospholipids for use in the present invention and include, but are not limited to, dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), dilaurylphosphatidylglycerol (DLPG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) dimyristoylphosphatidic acid (DMPA), distearoylphosphatidic acid (DSPA), dilaurylphosphatidic acid (DLPA), and dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPPA). Distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) is the preferred negatively charged lipid when used in formulations. Other suitable phospholipids include phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidic acids containing lauric, myristic, stearoyl, and palmitic acid chains. For the purpose of stabilizing the lipid membrane, it is preferred to add an additional lipid component, such as cholesterol. Preferred lipids for producing liposomes according to the invention include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in further combination with cholesterol (CH). According to one embodiment of the invention, a combination of lipids and cholesterol for producing the liposomes of the invention comprise a PE:PC:Chol molar ratio of 3:1:1. Further, incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing phospholipids is also contemplated by the present invention.",
                                "In addition, in order to prevent the uptake of the liposomes into the cellular endothelial systems and enhance the uptake of the liposomes into the tissue of interest, the outer surface of the liposomes may be modified with a long-circulating agent. The modification of the liposomes with a hydrophilic polymer as the long-circulating agent is known to enable to prolong the half-life of the liposomes in the blood",

Lloyd-Williams, et. al., 1997, CRC-Press, (ISBN-13: 978-0849391422). Solid phase peptide synthesis, developed by R. B. Merrifield, 1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 (14): 2149-2154, was a major breakthrough allowing for the chemical synthesis of peptides and small proteins. An insoluble polymer support (resin) is used to anchor the peptide chain as each additional alpha-amino acid is attached. This polymer support is constructed of 20-50 \u03bcm diameter particles which are chemically inert to the reagents and solvents used in solid phase peptide synthesis. These particles swell extensively in solvents, which makes the linker arms more accessible.",
                                "Organic linkers attached to the polymer support activate the resin sites and strengthen the bond between the amino acid and the polymer support. Chloromethyl linkers, which were developed first, have been found to be unsatisfactory for longer peptides due to a decrease in step yields. The PAM (phenylacetamidomethyl) resin, because of the electron withdrawing power of the acid amide group on the phenylene ring, provides a much more stable bond than the classical resin. Another alternative resin for peptides under typical peptide synthesis conditions is the Wang resin. This resin is generally used with the FMOC labile protecting group.",
                                "A labile group protects the alpha-amino group of the amino acid. This group should be easily removed after each coupling reaction so that the next alpha-amino protected amino acid may be added. Typical labile protecting groups include t-Boc and FMOC t-Boc is a very satisfactory labile group which is stable at room temperature and easily removed with dilute solutions of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and dichloromethane. FMOC is a base labile protecting group which is easily removed by concentrated solutions of amines (usually 20-55% piperidine in N-methylpyrrolidone). When using FMOC alpha-amino acids, an acid labile (or base stable) resin, such as an ether resin, is desired.",
                                "The stable blocking group protects the reactive functional group of an amino acid and prevents formation of complicated secondary chains. This blocking group must remain attached throughout the synthesis and may be removed after completion of synthesis. When choosing a stable blocking group, the labile protecting group and the cleavage procedure to be used should be considered.",
                                "After generation of the resin bound synthetic peptide, the stable blocknig groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin to produce a \u201cfree\u201d peptide. In general, the stable blocking groups and organic linkers are labile to strong acids such as TFA. After the peptide is cleaved from the resin, the resin is washed away and the peptide is extracted with ether to remove unwanted materials such as the scavengers used in the cleavage reaction. The peptide is then frozen and lyophilized to produce the solid peptide. This is then characterized by HPLC and MALDI before being used. In addition, the peptide should be purified by HPLC to higher purity before use.",

                                "Methods of designing peptide mimetics and screening of functional peptide mimetics are well known in the art. One basic method of designing a molecule which mimics a known protein or peptide first identifies the active region(s) of the known protein (for example in the case of an antibody-antigen interaction one identifies which region(s) of the antibody enable binding to the antigen), and then searches for a mimetic which emulates the active region. Since the active region of the known protein is relatively small, it is hoped that a mimetic will be found which is much smaller (e.g. in molecular weight) than the protein, and correspondingly easier and cheaper to synthesis. Such a mimetic could be used as a convenient substitute for the protein, as an agent for interacting with the target molecule.",
                                "For example, Reineke et al. (1999, Nature Biotechnology, 17;271-275) disclose a mimic molecule which is designed to mimic a binding site of the interleukin-10 protein, where the mimic molecule was designed using a large library of synthesized short peptides, each of which corresponded to a short section of interleukin 10. The binding of each of these peptides to the target (in this case an antibody against interleukin-10) was then tested individually by an assay technique, to identify potentially relevant peptides. Phage display libraries of peptides and alanine scanning method can be used.",
                                "Other methods for designing peptide mimetic to a particular peptide or protein include The Chemical Computing Group's Molecular Operating Environment\u201d (M.O.E.) software, European Patent EP1206494, the SuperMimic program by Andrean Goede et. al. 2006 BMC Bioinformatics, 7:11; and MIMETIC program by W. Campbell et al., 2002, Microbiology and Immunology 46:211-215. The SuperMimic program is designed to identify compounds that mimic parts of a protein, or positions in proteins that are suitable for inserting mimetics. The application provides libraries that contain peptidomimetic building blocks on the one hand and protein structures on the other. The search for promising peptidomimetic linkers for a given peptide is based on the superposition of the peptide with several conformers of the mimetic. New synthetic elements or proteins can be imported and used for searching. The MIMETIC computer program, which generates a series of peptides for interaction with a target peptide sequence, is taught by W.Campbell et. al., 2002.

Mutant mice displayed extensive cytopenia in all nucleated lineages and platelets one day after the full dose of pIpC (FIG. 1A and Table 1), while no difference was observed in hematopoietic parameters prior to Cre activation (Table 2). The multi-lineage defect was only seen transiently and was completely resolved 3 weeks post pIpC (Table 3). All mice remained healthy for an additional >8 months (data not shown).",
                                "The multi-lineage cytopenia could be a result of impairment in either a common primitive multipotent population, or in multiple independent committed lineages (e.g. T and B cells). To assess whether HSCs affected by Dicer loss, whole bone marrow from control or mutant mice (CD45.2+) were mixed in equal numbers with competitor bone marrow (CD45.1+) and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1+). The contribution to T cells, B cells and myeloid cells in the peripheral blood (PB) was monitored over time (FIGS. 1B and C, FIG. 5B). While both groups showed \u02dc50% donor type (CD45.2+) reconstitution in all lineages prior to pIpC injection, reconstitution from the mutants declined after pIpC treatment, and remained declined until 20 weeks post transplantation, when donor contribution is primarily coming from stem cells. The reduction in reconstitution could also be observed in secondary transplant recipients, underscoring the importance of Dicer in HSCs (FIG. 5C). However, the presence of T cells, B cells and myeloid cells were all readily detectable in roughly normal proportions within the donor cell compartment (CD45.2+) (FIG. 5A). The normal lineage distribution within the remaining donor type cells suggests that the impairment was within a common primitive multipotent population, rather than separate committed lineages, as it is unlikely that Dicer loss would concurrently and proportionately affect the lineages to the same extent. Furthermore, the donor cell contribution to immuno-phenotypic stem cells was similarly reduced (FIG. 1D), and this reduction was confirmed by functional assessment in secondary transplants (data not shown).",

                                "To reconcile the drastic reduction in overall donor cell reconstitution and an apparent absence of abnormality with the remnant donor hematopoiesis, the deletion status of the floxed Dicer allele was investigated. Donor type cells from the peripheral blood were FACS sorted 6 months post-transplant and genomic DNA was tested for Dicer deletion (FIG. 2A). All mice transplanted with control Cre+Dicerlox/wt cells showed complete deletion of all the loxed alleles, attesting to the expected high efficiency of the MxCre system. However, mice received Cre+Dicerlox/wt cells all harbored one \u201cloxed\u201d allele (functionally wild type allele) in addition to one deleted allele (\u0394). To enable the assay at a clonal level, donor type bone marrow were FACS sorted and plated into methylcellulose for clonal amplification. While there was no difference in the types and numbers of colonies between the control and mutant cells (data not shown), no colony could be identified with a DicerA/A genotype (0/34) (FIG. 2A, bottom table). This is not due to the inefficiency of the MxCre system, as the control Dicerlox/wt colonies all showed a Dicer\u0394/wt genotype (38/38). Dicer\u0394/\u0394 colonies were also completely absent from bone marrow cells of non transplanted animals received pIpC while all control colonies showed a Dicer\u0394/wt genotype from the Dicerlox/wt cells (Table 5). These experiments demonstrate that the HSCs with incompletely deleted Dicer are responsible for the hematopoietic recovery and highlight the essentiality of Dicer in HSC maintenance.",

                                "To directly test the sensitivity to Dicer loss among different primitive hematopoietic populations, LKS cells containing all the long term repopulating ability, and the Lin-c-Kit+Sca\u2212 (LKS\u2212) population containing all the non-lymphoid progenitors were FACS sorted and cultured in vitro in the presence of interferon \u03b2 (INF \u03b2), the activator of Cre expression. Under conditions where Dicer is efficiently deleted (FIG. 6), Cre+Dicerlox/lox LKS cells showed markedly increased death (7-AAD+/Anexin V+ cells) (data not shown). As a result, viable cell output from CD48-LKScells, CD48+ LKS and LKS\u2212 was differentially affected by Dicer loss. While INF-\u03b2 induced a cytostatic response in the control CD48-LKS cells, mutant CD48-LKS cells displayed further inhibition (\u02dc30% of that of control) (FIG. 2D). In sharp contrast, the closely related CD48+ LKS population behaved similarly in both control and mutant cells, and the mutant LKS+ progenitors showed even somewhat superior cell output in this setting. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that there is differential dependence on Dicer among the closely related early hematopoietic cells and the CD48-LKS cells display distinctive sensitivity to Dicer loss.",
                                "To directly test differentiation-stage-specific sensitivity to Dicer loss, several bone marrow populations were examined for apoptosis immediately following pIpC treatment. LKS cells (containing all long-term repopulating ability), Lin-Kit+Sca\u2212 (LK+S\u2212) cells (containing myeloid progenitors), and another heterogeneous population Lin-Kit-Sca+ (LK-S+) were examined for caspase-3 activation. Mutant LKS cells displayed a marked increase in apoptosis, whereas the L-K+S\u2212 myeloid progenitor population and L-K\u2212S+ population were not affected (FIG. 2E). Meanwhile, mutant bone marrow demonstrated increased Ki67 staining suggesting a compensatory response to cell loss possibly accounting for the transient nature of the drop in mature blood cell production (FIG. 2F).",
                                "If Dicer is dispensable for progenitors, which can form colonies in methylcellulose, colonies with a Dicer\u0394/\u0394 genotype should be preserved when competition is not present. Control and mutant bone marrow cells were plated into methylcellulose in the absence or presence of INF-\u03b2. Distinctive colonies were observed in the mutant colony cultures with INF-\u03b2 (FIG. 2B) and subsequent PCR confirmed that these colonies indeed had fully deleted Dicer (FIG. 2C). Thus Dicer null status is not required for colony forming progenitor survival or growth. The absolute absence of Dicer\u0394/\u0394 colonies from bone marrow where Cre was induced in vivo may be attributable to the HSC defect precluding progenitor generation in fully deleted cells. Only HSCs that harbor incompletely deleted Dicer provided descendent colony forming progenitor cells.",

                                "Dicer is involved in the maturation of both mature microRNAs and siRNAs with microRNAs better defined as demarcating developmental stage. The global microRNA expression were examined in the primitive hematopoietic compartments with varying degree of self-renewal ability (FIG. 3A). The expression of multiple microRNAs correlates with the ability to self-renew (Table 4), thus they may serve regulatory roles, or merely as markers, for the self renewal state. Of particular interest, three microRNAs, miR-99b, let-7e and miR-125a, are highly expressed in long-term (LT) HSCs compared to other populations (FIG. 3D). These three microRNAs scored high in LT-HSCs display a complete evolutionary conservation and organize in a cluster spanning a \u02dc1 kb region on chromosome 19 in human and in mice (data not shown). These features prompted the testing of the function of this microRNA cluster in regulating HSC self-renewal.",

This increase in multi-lineage reconstitution was accentuated in secondary transplantion (data not shown), suggesting this microRNA cluster has positively modified the activity of HSCs.",

                                "Individual microRNAs in the cluster were analyzed for an impact on stem cell function. miR-125a alone, but not miR-99b and let-7e, provided increased long-term multi-lineage reconstitution (FIGS. 4A, B, D and E). As enhanced survival or proliferation of the committed progenitors can present a similar phenotype, purified common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte and macrophage progenitors (GMP) and megakaryocyte and erythroid progenitors (MEP), as well as the LKS cells were tested for their ability to gain or maintain, partly or entirely, the stem cell property of self renewal after miR-125a transduction (FIG. 4F). The production of mature cells in the peripheral blood from the progenitor populations (CLP, CMP, GMP and MEP) was minimal and disappeared completely in the early weeks (3-6 weeks) post transplantation. LKS cells transduced with the control vector generated <2% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, LKS cells transduced with miR-125a reconstituted >70% of peripheral blood cells starting from 3 weeks post transplantation and lasting through 5 months (FIG. 4F) and secondary transplantation (data not shown). These results highly indicate that miR-125a positively modified the production capacity of HSCs and HSC number, but is not capable of delivering self-renewal ability to committed progenitors.",
                                "To determine whether miR-125a affects the quantity of reconstituting stem cells, competitive limiting dilution assay (LDA) analysis was performed using total GFP+ bone marrow cells from the primary transplants. The ability of LDA analysis to reliably reflect stem cell number is dependent upon the productivity of the test stem cells. Reconsitution by the transplanted test stem cells is scored based on a minimal representation of the test cell genotype in the blood of recipient animals. Therefore, in settings where differentiation and production of mature blood cells is altered within the stem cell population there can be skewing of the results. For example, if differentiation of mature cells was markedly impaired the stem cell number would be underestimated due to low scoring of donor genotype in the blood. Therefore, the ability of miR-125a transduced cells to produce mature cell types was examined (data not shown). Having documented that multi-lineage cells were not substantially affected, both myeloid and lymphoid lineages were scored in the LDA. It was estimated that one in every \u02dc5 million vector-transduced cells to be stem cells, while one in every \u02dc1 million of miR-125a-transduced cells to be such. Considering the overall >2 fold GFP+ percentage increase in the primary transplants, miR-125a has expanded HSC numbers by at least 10 fold. The increase in stem cell numbers can have a reduced dependence for a specialized microenvironment, or niche, since robust stem cell activity was preserved during an 18 day in vitro culture period if miR-125a was expressed (FIG. 4C and FIG. 7). Conversely, inhibiting the activity of miR-125a by an antagomir, obliterated the presence of high proliferative potential colonies and secondary colonies in methylcellulose assays (FIG. 4G).",
                                "In a subsequent LDA analysis, using >1% of both lineages as the criteria for reconstitution, it was estimated that one in every \u02dc2 million control-vector-transduced cells to be stem cells, whereas one in every \u02dc0.6 million of miR-125a-transduced cells to be such (FIG. 4H). Total GFP+ bone marrow cells were FACS-sorted from primary transplantation recipients 5 months post-transplant. Four different cell doses (2,000,000, 200,000, 50,000 and 10,000) were tested with 10 animals per cell dose for either control- or miR-125a-transduced cells. 250,000 un-fractionated wild-type whole bone marrow cells were used to provide competitors and radio-protection. A responder was called when myeloid (Mac1+) and lymphoid lineages (B220+ and CD3+) showed \u22671% GFP+ cells. Stem cell frequency was calculated using the L-calc software. p<0.05.Considering the overall 2-10 fold GFP+% increase in the primary transplants, miR-125a has expanded hematopoietic stem cell numbers by an estimated 6-30 fold. Of note, the increase in stem cells was not associated with complete differentiation blockade (though there was an increase in myeloid cells) and no animals developed evidence of leukemia.",

Whole bone marrow from transplanted animals was stained with lineage cocktail, AnnexinV and 7-AAD. 7-AAD-GFP+ cells were divided into two populations based on their expression of collective lineage markers. Lineage negative population is defined as the lowest 3% cells expressing lineage markers. Bone marrow from mice transplanted with control- or miR-125a-transduced cells were analyzed for apoptosis after re-establishment of homeostasis. It was observed that there was decreased apoptosis in miR-125a-tranduced cells in the lineage-negative population, but not in the more mature lineage-positive cells (FIG. 4I), indicating a cell-type-specific effect of miR-125a. These data are consistent with the anti-apoptotic effect being at least partially responsible for the increase in the reconstituting cell pool.",

                                "The HSC pool size is controlled by balancing fates of self-renewal versus differentiation and apoptosis. HL-60 cells were infected with a vector control virus (Control) or one that expresses miR-125a. Total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for Bak1, or \u03b2-actin as a loading control. Indeed, over-expression of Bcl-2 has been shown to increase the stem cell pool. Given the reduced apoptosis in primitive cells and the greatly expanded HSC pool size, it was reasonable that miR-125a could target certain pro-apoptotic proteins. Among the predicted evolutionarily conserved miR-125a targets, Bak1 (Bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1) is well known for its pro-apoptotic activity. HL-60 cells were transduced with a control virus or one that expresses miR-125a. MiR-125a expression reduced endogenous Bak1 protein by \u02dc50% (FIG. 4J). Scanning the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of Bak1 revealed one conserved miR-125a targeting site. To ascertain whether the inhibitory effect of miR-125a was mediated through its 3\u2032UTR, the UTR sequence was fused to a luciferase reporter. The Bak1 3\u2032UTR sequence, wild type (WT) or mutant for the miR-125a target site, were cloned 3\u2032 to a luciferase reporter. These reporter constructs were co-transfected into 293T cells in triplicates with either a control vector or miR-125a. MiR-125a caused \u02dc50% inhibition of the luciferase activity. In addition, mutation of the conserved miR-125a targeting site alleviated most of the inhibition by miR-125a (FIG. 4K). Consistent with the observation that miR-125a is the single microRNA within the miR-99b-let-7e-miR-125a cluster that mediates the HSC expansion; miR-125a inhibited the Bak1 3\u2032UTR construct (FIG. 4L), while miR-99b and let-7e had minimal effect. Taken together, out data are consistent with miR-125a antagonizing a critical pro-apoptotic protein to relieve HSPCs from apoptosis allowing extensive expansion of hematopoietic stem cells.",

In other systems where Dicer was deleted, e.g. embryonic stem cells, T and B cells, cells tolerated a Dicer null status and did not die, albeit proliferation and differentiation abnormalities were often observed. HSCs however, display absolute dependence on Dicer for maintenance. In the absence of Dicer, stem cells do not have continued ability to produce blood cells, as shown by the much reduced levels immunophenotypically and undergo apoptosis with increased frequency. Stem cells usually possess multiple fate options and adoption of a determined fate is associated with extensive epigenetic reinforcement that may involve microRNAs. Lack of microRNAs may severely compromise the fate choice required for proper stem cell function, but perhaps be less critical for cells where lineage commitment has occurred and more durable epigenetic mechanisms of cell state have been imposed.",
