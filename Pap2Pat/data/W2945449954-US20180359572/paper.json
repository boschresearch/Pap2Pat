    "date": "2019-05-01",
    "abstract": "The effect of personalized microphone array calibration on the performance of hearing aid beamformers under noisy reverberant conditions is studied. The study makes use of a new, publicly available, database containing acoustic transfer function measurements from 29 loudspeakers arranged on a sphere to a pair of behind-the-ear hearing aids in a listening room when worn by 27 males, 14 females, and 4 mannequins. Bilateral and binaural beamformers are designed using each participant's hearing aid head-related impulse responses (HAHRIRs). The performance of these personalized beamformers is compared to that of mismatched beamformers, where the HAHRIR used for the design does not belong to the individual for whom performance is measured. The case where the mismatched HAHRIR is that of a mannequin is of particular interest since it represents current practice in commercially available hearing aids. The benefit of personalized beamforming is assessed using an intrusive binaural speech intelligibility metric and in a matrix speech intelligibility test. For binaural beamforming, both measures demonstrate a statistically signficant (p < 0.05) benefit of personalization. The benefit varies substantially between individuals with some predicted to benefit by as much as 1.5 dB.",

                "Multichannel speech enhancement is important in many applications, including telecommunications, robot audition, and hearing aids. Signal-dependent beamformers adapt their filter weights according to the observed signals and so have the potential to be always-optimal according to some specified design criterion. However, errors in estimating the signal and noise statistics, for example, due to inaccurate voice activity detection, 1 may lead to degraded performance. A common approach to implementing a signal-dependent beamformer is to use a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) comprising a signal independent beamformer, a blocking matrix, and an adaptive noise canceller. 2 Signal-dependent beamformers are sensitive to signal cancellation due to steering errors and multipath propagation. 3,4 Signal-independent beamformers, also known as fixed beamformers, use a priori knowledge or assumptions about the source direction and noise characteristics to determine the filter weights. They are computationally efficient and robust at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNRs) but suboptimal if the sound scene or array characteristics differ from those used in the filter design. 5 For example, using a free-field propagation model to describe the acoustic transfer function (ATF) between a source and a head-mounted array degrades performance. 6 The effect of steering errors can be inferred from the shape of the beampattern's main lobe, which in general gets narrower with the number of microphones and their spacing. 5 Differences in array element sensitivity, due for example, to manufacturing tolerances and component ageing, have been mitigated through robust offline beamformer design 7 and adaptive approaches. 8,9 A number of studies have demonstrated a benefit in performance when microphone arrays are individually calibrated rather than by using an idealized model of the geometry. [10][11][12] This calibration accounts for any sensitivity or frequency response variations between microphones and also acoustic differences in the scattering effect of the array enclosure.",
                "In the context of binaural hearing aids, it is common to design beamformers assuming an average head, as typified by an acoustic mannequin. To investigate the potential benefit of individual calibration, or personalization, in the context of binaural hearing aids requires an understanding of the variability of the ATF when a particular pair of hearing aids is worn by different people. We refer to this ATF as the hearing aid head-related transfer function (HAHRTF), or equivalently its time domain representation, the hearing aid head-related impulse response (HAHRIR). Most available databases [13][14][15][16][17] of HAHRIR measurements have used either a single mannequin or a single human 17 and so are unsuitable for investigating such differences; a notable exception is a recent database 18 that includes measurements of 16 subjects and 3 dummy heads. Comparing measurements between these databases is also not helpful since each uses a different hearing aid device. Measurements of conventional, twochannel head-related impulse response (HRIRs) are typically made in the ear-canal or at the blocked entrance to the ear canal. Databases of such measurements, for example, CIPIC, 19 LISTEN, 20 and ARI, 21 suggest that there are large differences between individuals. These differences arise from differences in the head geometry and direction-dependent resonances of the pinnae and primarily affect localization accuracy in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. Quantifying the extent to which the use of personalized or generic HAHRTFs in hearing aid beamforming affects intelligibility for a human listener is important in determining whether commercially available hearing aids could benefit from personalized processing.",
                "In this article we describe a newly collected and publicly available database of 46 HAHRIRs measurements which will, for the first time, allow the benefits of individual calibration of hearing aid arrays to be investigated. There are many ways in which inter-individual variability in the measured ATFs could be analyzed. Also, there are many algorithms and signal processing tasks which may benefit from individual array calibration. In this article, we focus on signal-independent beamforming because it is widely used in practice. 22 The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II briefly describes the acoustic measurements and post-processing. Section III presents the beamforming problem. Section IV presents the method by which the newly acquired database is used to simulate noisy, reverberant speech signals and to design matched and mismatched beamformers for its enhancement. The performance of the beamformers is evaluated and analyzed using signal-based metrics in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, the validity of this analysis is confirmed using a headphone-based matrix speech intelligibility test in which 11 participants heard a virtual representation of unprocessed and enhanced sound scenes where all stimuli were created using the participant's own HAHRIRs. Finally, the article is concluded in Sec. VII."

Loudspeakers (Genelec 8050A) were arranged on the surface of a sphere of radius 1.9 m in three equally spaced horizontal rings. Following the AES standard 23 spherical co-ordinates system, loudspeakers were located at elevation, h \u00bc 0 , azimuth, / 2 {0 , 22.5 ,\u2026, 337.5 } and at h 2 645 , / 2 {30 , 90 ,\u2026, 330 }.

As far as possible, a typical positioning of the hearing aid devices was obtained by allowing participants to insert the in-ear microphones in the ear canal themselves. However, to avoid snagging of the cables, the BTE devices were placed over the ear by the experimenter, and, since the same transducers were used for all participants, the wire lengths adjoining in-ear microphones to the shells were not customized for each individual. Participants were seated on a chair positioned at the centre of the loudspeaker array and the height of the chair adjusted such that the BTE microphones were in the horizontal plane of the loudspeaker array, thereby ensuring the middle ring of loudspeakers corresponds to an elevation of 0 .",

Measurement signal output and acquisition was performed with 24-bit precision at 44.1 kHz sample rate using a Ferrofish DANTE A32 interface. A direct loopback connection between an output and input was used to measure the internal delay of the measurement system which was removed in post-processing.",
                "Impulse responses, g m,i (t), between loudspeaker i and microphone m were measured using the exponential sine sweep method 24 using a 370 ms sweep between 50 Hz and 16 kHz. The sweep duration was chosen to give an acceptable compromise between the time taken to make the measurements, and hence the risk of head movements, and the SNR of the impulse responses. For the subset of microphones and directions used in this study (see Sec. directions were measured in succession with 370 ms silence between each sweep giving a total measurement time of about 20 s. The measurements were repeated with the participant rotated by \u00c015 and \u00c030 so that direct path impulse responses are available with 7.5 resolution on the horizontal plane and 30 resolution at elevations 645 . For each rotation, the measurements were repeated three times to allow for consistency checks. Only one measurement of each direction/rotation combination is retained in the final database. In all, the acoustic measurements took about 10 min.",

Table I shows the distribution of head circumferences for the human (i.e., non-mannequin) participants. For comparison, the head circumference of the HATS is 55.9 cm.",

Similar calibration measurements were also made for the left and right hearing aids separately. Compared to the mean sensitivity, microphones varied by 0.4 dB. With the exception of the overhead loudspeaker, loudspeaker sensitivities varied by 0.8 dB and propagation delay from each loudspeaker to the center of the array varied by 93 ls.",

In binaural beamforming, the spatial filter associated with each hearing aid again obtains an estimate of the desired signal at its own reference channel, but the two hearing aids are treated as a single array with M \u00bc 4 microphones. Therefore, in both bilateral beamforming (denoted \"2:2\") and binaural beamforming (denoted \"4:4\"), the MVDR solution ensures that, provided d a (u j , x) is known, the signals will retain the correct binaural cues for the target source. In contrast, the binaural cues associated with the noise will not be preserved. 35 In the case of the bilateral beamformers, the residual noise at each ear depends only on the microphone signals at that ear and so the coherence between the noise at each ear is no higher than the original microphone signals. For the binaural beamformer, the enhanced signals at each ear are two different weighted combinations of the same M \u00bc 4 microphone signals and so the noise coherence is increased to unity. 36 In practice, estimates of d a (u j , x) and R v (x) are obtained using calibration measurements and assumptions about the spatial distribution of the noise, or online using the received signals.

Conversely, the binaural beamformers are more symmetric between the left and right sides. In general, for a frontal target position, the personalized binaural beamformer directivity patterns are much sharper than the personalized bilateral directivity patterns. This is not the case for the lateral target.",
                "Individual s42 (left column) is the same mannequin as in s28 but measured on a different day. Any difference in the directivity pattern between the \"Per\" and \"HATS\" conditions for s42 is therefore representative of the variation which might be expected due to, for example, reseating the hearing aids. It also gives an indication of the intrinsic variability due to the measurement setup. For the frontal target, the directivity patterns in \"Per\" and \"HATS\" conditions have a very similar shape. The largest differences, 1 and 3 dB for bilateral and binaural, respectively, occur between 120 and 150 . Whilst the bilateral response at 0 is 0 dB, the binaural response is \u00c01 dB. It is possible that this difference is due to a small difference in head alignment during the two sets of measurements. Since bilateral beamformers have a broader main lobe they are also more robust to steering errors. 5 For the lateral target, performance for s42 is essentially identical in the \"Per\" and \"HATS\" conditions, suggesting that the beamformers are robust to small differences in the array manifold. The directivity patterns are also the same for bilateral and binaural beamforming, suggesting that in this configuration the contralateral microphones do not contribute substantially.",
                "Participant s34 has a head circumference most similar to s28 (56.0 cm cf. 55.9 cm). Nevertheless, comparison of the \"Ref\" directivity between s34 and s42 shows differences of up to 6 dB at 180 . The result is that the \"HATS\" directivity patterns are distorted compared to the \"Per\" directivity patterns. Performance for the binaural beamformer steered to the front is particularly bad with 1.5 dB of attenuation in the target direction and 3 dB less suppression than the \"Per\" beamformer over most other angles.",
                "Participant s32 is the least similar to the HATS in terms of head circumference with the biggest head (62.7 cm) of all FIG. 2. (Color online) A-weighted directivity patterns of five beamformer configurations steered to (upper row) the front and (lower row) the side for (left column) s42, which is HATS remeasured, (middle column) s34, who has the head circumference most similar to the HATS, and (right column) s32, who has the largest head circumference measured. tested individuals. Again, the \"4:4 HATS\" directivity pattern is <0 dB at 0 for the frontal target, but in this case more suppression is achieved that with the \"4:4 Per\" beamformer between 22.5 and 67.5 . However, this is offset by substantially less attenuation between 112.5 and 337.5 .",
                "With the lateral target, for s32 and s34 there is negligible difference between bilateral and binaural beamforming, but a clear effect of personalization. For some directions towards the rear, the benefit of personalization is 4-5 dB.",
                "In general, the analysis of directivity patterns suggests that, for the frontal target, binaural beamforming always gives a benefit over bilateral beamforming, regardless of personalization, but in both cases, personalization leads to more compact directivity patterns and avoids signal attenuation in the target direction. For the lateral target binaural beamforming offers little, if any, advantage over bilateral, but personalization offers a substantial improvement, particularly in suppression of sound arriving from the rear."

However, they do not account for the reverberation properties of the room and they do not consider the effect of interaural coherence on binaural hearing. Therefore, directivity patterns do not allow one to easily assess the effective speech intelligibility improvement experienced by a listener in practice. To address this, we (i) simulate noisy reverberant listening conditions, and (ii) assess the effect of hearing aid beamformers using an intrusive measure of predicted binaural speech intellgibility."

Bilateral and binaural beamformers are designed for each participant, l 0 , in the database, as described in Sec. IV B. Consistent with the steering vectors used, the desired signal at each ear is bh \u00f0l\u00de a \u00f0u j ; t\u00deg \u00f0l\u00de m;j \u00f0t\u00de \u00c3 s\u00f0t\u00de where, as in Eq. ( 5), a is the index of the reference channel at that ear. That is, the direct path component of the target source as observed at the reference microphones. For each combination of signals and beamformers, the predicted intelligibility of the enhanced binaural signals are computed using the MBSTOI metric 46,47 for input SNRs \u00c017, \u00c014, \u00c011, and \u00c08 dB. It was shown 46,47 that the MBSTOI is able to predict well the intelligibility of speech signals in combined additive noise and reverberation, similar to the ones in this study.",
                "For each combination tested, a logistic model was fitted to the monotonically increasing MBSTOI vs SNR relationship. The SNR at which the model achieved a MBSTOI value of 0.25, compared to the SNR at which the unprocessed noisy signal achieved the same value, was taken to be a measure of the equivalent improvement in input SNR in dB. The MBSTOI value of 0.25 was chosen as the midpoint between the best-case value at \u00c017 dB (0.21) and the worst-case value at \u00c08 dB (0.29). The choice of reference is not critical since the slopes of the logistic models are very similar. This measure of equivalent SNR improvement allows an intuitive way to compare the predicted binaural intelligibility benefit of personalized (l 0 \u00bc l) beamformers and all possible non-personalized (l 0 6 \u00bc l) beamformers. FIG. 3.

                "The equivalent SNR improvement for bilateral and binaural beamformers is shown in the left and right columns of Fig. 3, respectively, in response to a frontal (top row) and lateral (bottom row) target. The shift in ordinate axes between plots reflects the overall trends that binaural beamformers offer greater benefit than bilateral beamformers and that greater benefit is obtained for a frontal target than a lateral target. The particular focus of this study is the relative benefit of personalized beamforming. In general, the benefit obtained using the personalized beamformers is greater than for non-personalized beaformers, as summarized by the interquartile range (IQR). This is particularly apparent for the binaural beamformers. However, there are some combinations of individual, beamformer, and target for which the best non-personalized beamformer, denoted \"Best non-per\" performs better than the personalized one. This is more frequent for bilateral beamformers, with 14 occurrences for the frontal target and 22 occurrences for the lateral target, than for binaural beamformers, with four occurrences each for the frontal and lateral targets. This non-optimal performance of the personalized beamformer in some cases is possibly due to the small mismatch between the simulated conditions and the model assumptions. An alternative explanation, given the small differences involved, is that it is a limitation of the MBSTOI metric. In any case, it should be noted that the best-performing non-personalized beamformer is different in each case.",
                "Of particular interest is performance using the HATSderived beamformer, since a HATS is intended to represent an average person. In all but two cases (s1 and s40 with bilateral beamformer and frontal target) the improvement obtained using the personalized beamformer is greater than the benefit of the HATS beamformer. It is therefore expected that personalized beamforming will improve speech intelligibility compared to generic beamforming using filters derived from the HATS.",
                "In Fig. 4, the predicted relative benefit of personalized beamformers compared to the HATS beamformers are shown. The boxplots show the overall distribution and the crosses to the right of each box are the predicted benefits only for those individuals who also participated in the matrix speech intelligibility test reported in Sec. VI. The median predicted benefit of personalization for bilateral beamformers is from 0.3 to 0.4 dB and the median equivalent predicted SNR benefit of personalization for binaural beamformers is from 0.6 to 0.7 dB. In all cases, these medians are significantly (p < 0.05) different to 0 dB. In addition to this overall result, it is interesting that some individuals are predicted to benefit substantially more, up to 2.0 and 1.8 dB, for personalized bilateral and binaural beamforming, respectively.",
                "The results presented in this section suggest that HATSderived beamformers may be close to optimal for some individuals but far from it for others. One might expect the extent of the benefit to be related to, for example, the similarity of an individual's head size to that of the HATS. However, dividing the population into two equally-sized groups based on head size did not lead to a significantly better improvement for the smaller group, which is more similar to the HATS head. Therefore, the psychophysical validation of the effect of beamformer personalization on speech intelligibility, reported in Sec. VI, treats all participants as belonging to a single group."

Following the procedure of Experiment 3 in Ref. 49, in each trial the participant listened to a single presentation of a sentence from the Dantale II corpus 50 and used a graphical user interface to select the heard words. For each of the five words in a sentence, the subjects were offered a choice between ten possible words and the option to pass (if the word had not been heard at all). Stimuli were generated according to Eq. (10), with the speech level scaling parameter, b, set to give SNRs prior to enhancement of \u00c017, \u00c014, \u00c011, and \u00c08 dB. These SNRs were determined in pilot experiments to elicit word accuracy rates which approximately span the informative range of word accuracy scores over all test conditions. The playback level was set such that a noise-only stimuli, i.e., b \u00bc 0, was presented at approximately 65 dB sound pressure level (SPL).",

It is immediately apparent that all the beamformers offer substantial improvement over the reference condition. This is particularly true with the frontal target where performance in the reference condition is worse than with the lateral target. This is consistent with both the literature 51,52 and the numerical results presented in Sec. V.",

Statistical significance of word accuracy between conditions is addressed using a mixed-effects logistic regression as implemented in the \"lme4\" package 53 for R. 54 Fixed factors of target direction (frontal, lateral), configuration (bilateral, binaural), and personalization (personal, HATS) were coded with treatment contrasts while SNR was continuous. The random effect of participant identity was modelled as an independent offset. Starting from the null model, the likelihood ratio test was used to sequentially add significant (p < 0.05) main effects and interactions. At each stage simplification of the model by pruning terms was also tested.",
                "The final model includes significant effects of SNR and target direction and significant interactions between SNR and configuration and between configuration and personalization. Table III details the final model coefficients and standard errors in logit units. The positive coefficients indicate that increasing SNR increases intelligibility as does binaural beamforming with personalized filters. The negative coefficient for the lateral target condition indicates that, after beamforming, lateral targets are less intelligible than frontal targets. The negative coefficient for the interaction of binaural beamforming and SNR indicates that the relative benefit reduces as SNR increases. This is consistent with the fact that intelligibility reaches a ceiling at higher SNRs even without enhancement and so the relative benefit reduces. Note that there is no interaction between target direction and either the configuration or personalization of the beamformer.",
                "To give an intuitive sense of the mixed-effects logistic regression model behaviour, Fig. 6 shows the model response as a function of input SNR in terms of proportion correct for a frontal target (top) and lateral target (bottom). Improvements due to the significant fixed effects can be interpreted in terms of a left-shift of the 50% speech reception threshold (SRT). Here binaural beamforming reduces (improves) the SRT by 0.90 dB compared to bilateral beamforming and personalization adds a further benefit of 0.40 dB over the HATS derived beamformer. It should be stressed that the 0.40 dB benefit of personalization is the average predicted benefit over the population of test participants and is statistically significant at the 5% level; some individuals stand to benefit more than this relatively modest amount. It can be seen that the effect of the interaction between SNR and beamformer configuration is to reduce the relative benefit of binaural beamforming as SNR increases, since the probability of a correct response approaches 1 in all conditions.  Comparing the psychophysical experiment results reported in this section to the numerical results obtained in Sec. V B, the predicted intelligibility improvements were reasonably close. Considering only those participants who took part in the speech intelligibility test, as represented by the crosses in Fig. 4, the median benefit of personalization for binaural beamformers was predicted to be 0.52 dB and 0.68 dB for frontal and lateral targets, respectively, and 0.4 dB was achieved in practice. In the case of bilateral beamforming, no benefit of personalization was observed in the psychophysical experiment, whereas the numerical results predicted a median benefit of 0.22 and 0.52 dB for frontal and lateral targets, respectively."
