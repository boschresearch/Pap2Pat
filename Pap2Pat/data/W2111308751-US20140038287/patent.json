    "abstract": "Disclosed are processes for producing a variant polypeptide (e.g. antibodies) having modified binding characteristics for human Fc gamma receptor IIA (CD32A) leading to increased inhibition of proinflammatory mediators while retaining binding to a target antigen via its Fv portion, which processes comprise altering the polypeptides by substitution of at least two amino acid residues at EU position 325, 326 or 328 of a human IgG CH2 region for a sequence selected from SAAF, SKAF, NAAF and NKAF. Also disclosed are molecules, particularly polypeptides, more particularly immunoglobulins (e.g. antibodies) that include a variant CDR3 region, wherein the variant CDR3 region includes at least one amino acid modified relative to a wild-type CDR3 region. The polypeptides that can be generated according to the methods of the invention are highly variable, and they can include antibodies and fusion proteins that contain an Fc region or a biologically active portion thereof.",

                        "Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, comprise two heavy chains linked together by disulphide bonds and two light chains, each light chain being linked to a respective heavy chain by disulphide bonds. The general structure of an antibody of class IgG (i.e. an immunoglobulin (Ig) of class gamma (G) is shown schematically in FIG. 1A.",
                        "Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end and a constant domain at its other end, the light chain variable domain being aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain and the light chain constant domain being aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain.",
                        "Antigen binds to antibodies via an antigen binding site in the variable domains of each pair of light and heavy chains. Other molecules, known as effector molecules, bind to other sites in the remainder of the molecule, i.e. other than the antigen binding sites, and this portion of antibody will be referred to as \u201cthe constant portion\u201d of an antibody, such sites being located particularly in the Fc region constituted by the portions of the heavy chains extending beyond the ends of the light chains.",
                        "The constant portion of antibodies specifically interact with receptors on \u201ceffector\u201d cells. For example, the Fc region mediates effector functions that have been divided into two categories. In the first are the functions that occur independently of antigen binding; these functions due to the major histocompatibility complex class I-related receptor FcRn confer IgGs persistence in the circulation and the ability to be transferred across cellular barriers by transcytosis (see Ghetie V and Ward S). In the second are the functions that operate after an antibody binds an antigen; these functions involve the participation of the complement cascade or Fc receptor (FcR) bearing cells.",
                        "FcRs are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin isotypes. For example Fc receptors for IgG antibodies are referred to as Fc\u03b3R. FcRs are specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells that mediate both the removal of antibody-coated pathogens by phagocytosis of immune complexes, and the lysis of erythrocytes and various other cellular targets (e.g. tumor cells) coated with the corresponding antibody.",
                        "The Fc\u03b3Rs play a critical role in either abrogating or enhancing immune recruitment. Currently, three classes of Fc\u03b3Rs are distinguished on cells of the immune system: the high-affinity receptor Fc RI (CD64), capable of binding monomeric IgG; and the low-affinity receptors Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), which interact preferentially with complexed IgG. Furthermore, the Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII classes comprise both \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d forms (Gessner-J E et al. Ann Heamatol, 1998, The IgG Fc receptor family, 76: 231-248).",
                        "Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (106 M\u22121). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc \u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes. The gene for the Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor contains either G or A in codon 131, resulting in either arginine (CGT) or histidine (CAT), respectively, in the second extracellular domain. This change alters the ability of the receptor to bind IgG. Cells with Fc\u03b3RIIA His-131, the A/A genotype, bind human IgG2 with considerably higher affinity than those with Arg at position 131; conversely, cells with Arg-131, the G/G genotype, bind murine IgG1 with considerably higher affinity than those with His at position 131 (Salmon et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest. 89:1274-1281). Originally, studies using monocytes interaction with an anti-CD3 antibody of the murine IgG1 subclass as a trigger for T-cell proliferation classified individuals phenotypically as low responders of high responders (Tax et al., 1983, Nature:304: 445-447). It is now known that high responder cells in this assay have the G/G or A/G genotype while low-responder cells have the A/A genotype. The Fc\u03b3RIIa 131 R/R genotype is a risk factor for susceptibility to some infectious and autoimmune diseases (Van der Pol W. L. and Van de Winkel J. G. J, 1998, Immunogenetics 48:222-232).",
                        "Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RII-A and Fc\u03b3RII-B create two functionally heterogeneous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signal, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.",
                        "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have now been used to treat disease in human patients. Although some mAbs may function effectively without utilizing antibody effector functions (e.g. neutralizing antibodies), in many cases it may be desirable to engineer the Fc portion of the antibody to recruit the immune system to elicit an immune response. There exists a need in the art to produce antibodies that include a variant Fc region having increased potency while retaining the ability to bind to a given target. Accordingly, there exists a need to produce altered IgG antibodies that elicit a modified Fc receptor activity while retaining binding to an antigen as compared to an unaltered antibody."

The altered antibodies and altered polypeptide of the invention also include polypeptides that include at least an Fc\u03b3R binding portion of an Fc region of an immunoglobulin polypeptide and a variant CDR3 region. The altered antibodies and altered polypeptide of the invention also include polypeptides that include at least a variant Fc region of an immunoglobulin polypeptide and a variant CDR3 region. The variant CDR3 regions include the variant VH CDR3 regions shown in Example 4: KDPSDAFPY (SEQ ID NO: 80) and KDPSEGFPY (SEQ ID NO: 81).

For example, at least the amino acid residue at EU position 328 has been substituted with phenylalanine. In the altered antibodies described herein, at least the amino acid residue at EU position 328 alone or together with EU amino acid positions 325 and 326 are substituted with a different residue as compared to an unaltered antibody.",
                        "These altered antibodies with a modified Fc portion elicit modified effector functions e.g., a modified Fc receptor activity, as compared to an unaltered antibody. For example, the human Fc receptor is CD32A. In some embodiments, the altered antibodies elicit a prevention of proinflammatory mediators release following ligation to CD32A as compared to an unaltered antibody. Thus, the altered antibodies described herein elicit a modified Fc receptor activity, such as the prevention of proinflammatory mediators release while retaining the ability to bind a target antigen. In some embodiments, the altered antibody is a neutralizing antibody, wherein the altered antibody elicits a modified Fc receptor activity, while retaining the ability to neutralize one or more biological activities of a target antigen.",
                        "For example, altered antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies that bind the human TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex. This receptor complex is activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. The altered antibodies of the invention inhibit receptor activation and subsequent intracellular signaling via LPS. Thus, the altered antibodies neutralize the activation of the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex. In particular, the invention provides altered antibodies that recognize the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex expressed on the cell surface. These altered antibodies block LPS-induced IL-8 production. In addition, some altered antibodies of the invention also recognize TLR4 when not complexed with MD-2. The altered antibody is, e.g., a humanized antibody.",
                        "Antibodies of the invention include antibodies that bind the human TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex and also bind TLR4 independently of the presence of MD-2. Antibodies of the invention also include antibodies that bind the TLR4 portion of the human TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex but binding is dependent on the presence of MD-2, but binding is greatly enhanced by the presence of MD-2, which suggests that the presence of the MD-2 causes a conformational change in TLR4, thereby exposing an epitope bound by the antibody. In addition, antibodies of the invention include antibodies that bind the human TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex and also bind MD-2 in the presence of TLR4.",
                        "Altered antibodies of the invention also include antibodies that recognize targets such as any toll-like receptor. Toll receptors, first discovered in Drosophila, are type I transmembrane protein having leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the extracellular portion of the protein, and one or two cysteine-rich domains. The mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Toll receptors are known as \u201cToll-like receptors\u201d (TLRs). TLRs play a role in innate immunity by recognizing microbial particles and activating immune cells against the source of these microbial particles.",
                        "Currently, eleven types of Toll-like receptors have been identified in humans, TLRs 1-11 (Pandey S and Agrawal D K, Immunobiology of Toll-like-receptors: emerging trends. Immunol. Cell Biol., 2006; 84:333-341). These TLRs are characterized by the homology of their intracellular domains to that of the IL-1 receptor, and by the presence of extracellular leucine-rich repeats. The different types of TLRs are activated by different types of microbial particles. For example, TLR4 is primarily activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while TLR2 is activated by lipoteichoic (LTA), lipoarabinomannan (LAM); lipoprotein (BLP), and peptideglycans (PGN). Toll receptor homologs, such as RP105, have also been identified.",

The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. In general, antibody molecules obtained from humans relate to any of the classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD, which differ from one another by the nature of the heavy chain present in the molecule.

In particular, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the population. MAbs contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope of the antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.",

The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable (\u201cV\u201d) regions of the heavy (\u201cH\u201d) and light (\u201cL\u201d) chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy and light chains, referred to as \u201chypervariable regions,\u201d are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches known as \u201cframework regions,\u201d or \u201cFRs\u201d. Thus, the term \u201cFR\u201d refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between, and adjacent to, hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201ccomplementarity-determining regions,\u201d or \u201cCDRs.\u201d The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.

The term \u201cepitope\u201d includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. For example, antibodies may be raised against N-terminal or C-terminal peptides of a polypeptide. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is \u22661 \u03bcM; e.g., \u2266100 nM, preferably \u226610 nM and more preferably \u22661 nM.",

The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd) of the interaction, wherein a smaller Kd represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (Kon) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (Koff) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. (See Nature 361:186-87 (1993)). The ratio of Koff/Kon enables the cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is equal to the dissociation constant Kd. (See, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473). An antibody of the present invention is said to specifically bind to its target, when the equilibrium binding constant (Kd) is \u22661 \u03bcM, e.g., \u2266100 nM, preferably \u226610 nM, and more preferably \u22661 nM, as measured by assays such as radioligand binding assays or similar assays known to those skilled in the art.",

Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.",

In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic amino acids are aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic amino acids are lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar amino acids are alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan, and (4) uncharged polar amino acids are glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. The hydrophilic amino acids include arginine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, lysine, serine, and threonine. The hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. Other families of amino acids include (i) serine and threonine, which are the aliphatic-hydroxy family; (ii) asparagine and glutamine, which are the amide containing family; (iii) alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine, which are the aliphatic family; and (iv) phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, which are the aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. Science 253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the invention.",
                                "Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H.

Altered antibodies are generated, e.g., by immunizing BALB/c mice with combinations of cell transfectants expressing high levels of a given target on their surface. Hybridomas resulting from myeloma/B cell fusions are then screened for reactivity to the selected target.",
                                "Monoclonal antibodies are prepared, for example, using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro.",
                                "The immunizing agent will typically include the protein antigen, a fragment thereof or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.",
                                "Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of monoclonal antibodies. (See Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63)).",
                                "The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Moreover, in therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies, it is important to identify antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen.",
                                "After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. (See Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.",
                                "The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.",
                                "Monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, Nature 368, 812-13 (1994)) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.",
                                "Monoclonal antibodies of the invention include humanized antibodies or human antibodies. These antibodies are suitable for administration to humans without engendering an immune response by the human against the administered immunoglobulin. Humanized forms of antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that are principally comprised of the sequence of a human immunoglobulin, and contain minimal sequence derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization is performed, e.g., by following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. (See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539.) In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies also comprise, e.g., residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody includes substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also includes at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992)).",
                                "Fully human antibodies are antibody molecules in which the entire sequence of both the light chain and the heavy chain, including the CDRs, arise from human genes. Such antibodies are termed \u201chuman antibodies\u201d, or \u201cfully human antibodies\u201d herein. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by using trioma technique; the human B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor, et al., 1983 Immunol Today 4: 72); and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce monoclonal antibodies (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: MACT, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Monoclonal antibodies may be utilized and may be produced by using human hybridomas (see Cote, et al., 1983. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80: 2026-2030) or by transforming human B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: MACT, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).",
                                "In addition, human antibodies can also be produced using additional techniques, including phage display libraries. (See Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10, 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368 856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368, 812-13 (1994); Fishwild et al, Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-51 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnology 14, 826 (1996); and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern.

(See PCT publication WO94/02602). The endogenous genes encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains in the nonhuman host have been incapacitated, and active loci encoding human heavy and light chain immunoglobulins are inserted into the host's genome. The human genes are incorporated, for example, using yeast artificial chromosomes containing the requisite human DNA segments. An animal which provides all the desired modifications is then obtained as progeny by crossbreeding intermediate transgenic animals containing fewer than the full complement of the modifications. An example of such a nonhuman animal is a mouse termed the Xenomouse\u2122 as disclosed in PCT publications WO 96/33735 and WO 96/34096. This animal produces B cells which secrete fully human immunoglobulins. The antibodies can be obtained directly from the animal after immunization with an immunogen of interest, as, for example, a preparation of a polyclonal antibody, or alternatively from immortalized B cells derived from the animal, such as hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly, or can be further modified to obtain analogs of antibodies such as, for example, single chain Fv (scFv) molecules.",

No. 5,939,598. It can be obtained by a method, which includes deleting the J segment genes from at least one endogenous heavy chain locus in an embryonic stem cell to prevent rearrangement of the locus and to prevent formation of a transcript of a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, the deletion being effected by a targeting vector containing a gene encoding a selectable marker; and producing from the embryonic stem cell a transgenic mouse whose somatic and germ cells contain the gene encoding the selectable marker.",

This method includes introducing an expression vector that contains a nucleotide sequence encoding a heavy chain into one mammalian host cell in culture, introducing an expression vector containing a nucleotide sequence encoding a light chain into another mammalian host cell, and fusing the two cells to form a hybrid cell. The hybrid cell expresses an antibody containing the heavy chain and the light chain.",

Adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors and herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors are preferred for introducing the nucleic acid into neural cells. The adenovirus vector results in a shorter term expression (about 2 months) than adeno-associated virus (about 4 months), which in turn is shorter than HSV vectors. The particular vector chosen will depend upon the target cell and the condition being treated. The introduction can be by standard techniques, e.g. infection, transfection, transduction or transformation. Examples of modes of gene transfer include e.g., naked DNA, CaPO4 precipitation, DEAE dextran, electroporation, protoplast fusion, lipofection, cell microinjection, and viral vectors.",

For example, stereotaxic injection can be used to direct the vectors (e.g. adenovirus, HSV) to a desired location. Additionally, the particles can be delivered by intracerebroventricular (icy) infusion using a minipump infusion system, such as a SynchroMed Infusion System. A method based on bulk flow, termed convection, has also proven effective at delivering large molecules to extended areas of the brain and may be useful in delivering the vector to the target cell.

In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for a target such as TLR4, MD2, TLR4/MD2 complex, TLR2, CD14 or any toll-like receptor. The second binding target is any other antigen, and advantageously is a cell-surface protein or receptor or receptor subunit.",
                                "Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991).",

It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).",

The preferred interface includes at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \u201ccavities\u201d of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.",
                                "Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.",
                                "Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab\u2032 portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \u201cdiabody\u201d technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et al., J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994).",

Alternatively, an anti-antigenic arm of an immunoglobulin molecule can be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3R), such as Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular antigen. Bispecific antibodies can also be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein antigen described herein and further binds tissue factor (TF).",

                                "The linkers described above contain components that have different attributes, thus leading to conjugates with differing physio-chemical properties. For example, sulfo-NHS esters of alkyl carboxylates are more stable than sulfo-NHS esters of aromatic carboxylates. NHS-ester containing linkers are less soluble than sulfo-NHS esters. Further, the linker SMPT contains a sterically hindered disulfide bond, and can form conjugates with increased stability. Disulfide linkages, are in general, less stable than other linkages because the disulfide linkage is cleaved in vitro, resulting in less conjugate available. Sulfo-NHS, in particular, can enhance the stability of carbodimide couplings. Carbodimide couplings (such as EDC) when used in conjunction with sulfo-NHS, forms esters that are more resistant to hydrolysis than the carbodimide coupling reaction alone.",

An antibody preparation, preferably one having high specificity and high affinity for its target antigen, is administered to the subject and will generally have an effect due to its binding with the target. Administration of the antibody may abrogate or inhibit or interfere with the signaling function of the target. Administration of the antibody may abrogate or inhibit or interfere with the binding of the target with an endogenous ligand to which it naturally binds. For example, the antibody binds to the target and neutralizes LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production.",
                                "A therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention relates generally to the amount needed to achieve a therapeutic objective. As noted above, this may be a binding interaction between the antibody and its target antigen that, in certain cases, interferes with the functioning of the target. The amount required to be administered will furthermore depend on the binding affinity of the antibody for its specific antigen, and will also depend on the rate at which an administered antibody is depleted from the free volume other subject to which it is administered. Common ranges for therapeutically effective dosing of an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention may be, by way of nonlimiting example, from about 0.1 mg/kg body weight to about 50 mg/kg body weight.

Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. (See, e.g., Marasco et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 7889-7893 (1993)). The formulation can also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition can comprise an agent that enhances its function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, chemotherapeutic agent, or growth-inhibitory agent.

In some embodiments, the antibody contains a detectable label. Antibodies are polyclonal, or more preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab, scFv, or F(ab)2) is used. The term \u201clabeled\u201d, with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently-labeled streptavidin. The term \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended to include tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Included within the usage of the term \u201cbiological sample\u201d, therefore, is blood and a fraction or component of blood including blood serum, blood plasma, or lymph. That is, the detection method of the invention can be used to detect an analyte mRNA, protein, or genomic DNA in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro techniques for detection of an analyte mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of an analyte protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations, and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of an analyte genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations.

For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL\u2122 (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition.

This observation was more striking the lower the concentration of MAb used in the assay.

                                "Furthermore, it was thought that this difference was mediated via an Fc receptor-dependent mechanism. On HEK 293 cells (FIG. 1B) negative for Fc gamma receptors expression, the two MAbs, chimeric and murine 15C1, were equally potent whereas in an ex-vivo human whole blood assay, where leucocytes are positive for Fc gamma receptors expression, a clear difference was seen between them.",
                                "To further demonstrate the involvement of interactions between the MAb Fc portion and Fc\u03b3 receptors in a putative inhibitory response, a modification of mouse IgG1 15C1 was engineered to disrupt the ability of the antibody to engage cellular Fc\u03b3 receptors while retaining its affinity for its cognate antigen TLR4/MD2. The mutation of Asp to Ala at EU amino acid residue position 265 (D265A) was introduced into the mouse IgG1 15C1 gamma heavy chain gene, and this mutated sequence was expressed along with the 15C1 mouse kappa chain in PEAK cells to produce mutant (D265A) antibodies. In parallel recombinant wild type 15C1 heavy and light chains were co-expressed in PEAK cells to produce recombinant mouse IgG1 15C1. The mutation D265A when engineered in a mouse IgG1 isotype (IgG1-D265A) has been shown to anneal the binding of IgG1-D265A-containing immune complexes to mouse Fc-gamma receptors IIB (Fc\u03b3RIIB), III (Fc\u03b3RIII) and IV (F\u03b3RIV) (Nimmerjahn et al., Immunity, 2005, 23:41-51) as well as to nullify (.Fc\u03b3RI) or greatly reduce its binding to all human Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIII).

This result confirmed the hypothesis that binding of the Fc portion of mouse IgG1 to human Fc\u03b3 receptors contributes to the potency of 15C1 to neutralize LPS pro-inflammatory stimulation.",
                                "Mouse IgG1 has been described in the literature to have a high affinity for the human Fc\u03b3RII or CD32. Indeed, this high affinity of mouse IgG1 for human CD32 rendered the discovery of this receptor possible. It was, therefore, hypothesized that CD32 would be the key target receptor for the Fc of mouse IgG1 on human leukocytes. In order to verify this possibility, a human whole blood assay was performed using two different anti-human CD32 antibody (AT10 which recognizes equally well CD32A and CD32B; and IV.3 which binds to CD32A and weakly to CD32B) in order to prevent the binding of the Fc of mouse IgG1 to this receptor. Fresh heparinated blood from healthy volunteers was obtained by venipuncture and diluted 1:2 with RPMI 1640. The diluted blood was plated at 60 \u03bcl/well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.

Blood cells were then stimulated by adding 30 \u03bcl of E. coli K12 LPS (2 ng/ml final in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% HSA) to the wells and incubated for 6 hours. IL-6 production was then measured by ELISA.",
                                "In a human whole blood assay it was demonstrated (FIG. 4A) that both AT10 and IV.3 anti-human CD32 antibodies reduce the potency of mouse IgG1 15C1 to a similar level to that seen with chimeric IgG1 15C1. The fact that IV.3 binds strongly to CD32A, recognizes both phenotypic forms of Fc\u03b3RIIA equally well and weakly to CD32B, point to the involvement of human CD32A rather than CD32B.",
                                "CD32A contains a polymorphism (histidine or arginine) in its extracellular domain at amino acid 131. The nature of this polymorphism has an influence on the binding of mouse IgG1 to CD32A, with arginine homozygous individuals having a much higher affinity for mouse IgG1 than histidine homozygotes. Arginine/histidine heterozygotes have an intermediate affinity (Dijstelbloem, H. M. et al., 2001. Trends Immunol. 22:510-516). Healthy individuals were screened for their CD32A genotype at this polymorphism and tested 15C1-mediated blockade of LPS-dependent TLR4 activation in whole blood derived from homozygous and heterozygous individuals. For this experiment, 15C1 was produced in PEAK cells either in its original form (i.e. on a mouse IgG1 backbone) or as a chimeric MAb with the 15C1 variable region on a human IgG4 backbone. This format was chosen as human IgG4 is known to have a very poor affinity for CD32. Following protein A affinity chromatography purification, the integrity of both MAbs for TLR4/MD-2 binding on transfected CHO cells was confirmed and shown to be equivalent. In whole blood LPS-activation experiments, the mIgG1 version of 15C1 was considerably more potent at inhibiting TLR4 than the hIgG4 version when testing Arg/Arg and Arg/His donors. In contrast, mIgG1 15C1 was only slightly more potent that hIgG4 15C1 in His/His donors (FIG. 4B). IC50 values obtained for each dose response curve are shown in table 3. These values highlight the differences in potency between the 15C1mIgG1 and hIgG4 constructs for the different CD32 genotype donors. The mIgG1 construct shows a dramatic loss in potency from the Arg/Arg to the His/His donors (\u02dc35-fold), whereas the hIgG4 construct shows a marginal loss in potency (\u02dc3 fold). These results reinforce the contribution of CD32A to the inhibitory activities of the 15C1 MAb on TLR4 signalling.",

                                "Studies were then designed to determine the critical region within the Fc region of a mouse IgG1 antibody that is sufficient to maintain the biological contribution of the whole Fc region. It is known in the literature that both CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc region can contribute directly to the interaction with Fc\u03b3 receptors. In a first step towards the identification of the critical region contributing to this inhibitory effect, studies were designed to focus on the importance of the CH2 domain (EU positions 231 to 340, see alignment of CH2 domains in FIG. 16) since its role in the interaction of the Fc with Fc\u03b3 receptors is well documented. The CH2 domain of human IgG1 was replaced with that of mouse IgG1 (later referred as muCH2-chimeric IgG1 15C1; see FIG. 5A) and reciprocally the CH2 domain of mouse IgG1 was replaced with that of human IgG1 (later referred as huCH2-mouse IgG1 15C1; see FIG. 5A). The antibodies were produced in PEAK cells and purified from transfected-cell supernatants by protein G affinity column chromatography. Equivalent binding to CHO TLR4/MD2 transfectants by FACS was observed indicating that the change of CH2 domain had no significant influence on the relative affinity for the antigen. The neutralizing capability of murine 15C1, huCH2-mouse IgG1 15C1, chimeric IgG1 15C1 and muCH2-chimeric IgG1 15C1 was evaluated in the human whole blood assay. Fresh heparinated blood from healthy volunteers was obtained by venipuncture and diluted 1:2 with RPMI 1640. The diluted blood was plated at 60 \u03bcl/well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Then 30 \u03bcl of serial dilutions in RPMI 1640 of the mouse IgG1 15C1, chimeric IgG1 15C1, mouse IgG1 15C1 containing human CH2 and chimeric IgG1 15C1 containing mouse CH2 MAbs were added to the blood and incubated for an hour at 37\u00b0 C.

On the other hand, the recombinant version containing the human CH2 was not as potent as the fully mouse IgG1 15C1 IgG1, but had an activity reduced to that of the chimeric IgG1 15C1 (FIG. 5B). From these data, it was concluded that the Fc-mediated inhibitory contribution is restricted to the CH2 domain of the heavy chain of mouse IgG1.",

Starting with the chimeric IgG115C1 containing the full length mouse CH2 domain, the approach was to identify the critical region of the CH2 domain by introducing a maximum number of human residues without observing a loss of the Fc-mediated inhibitory activity. The identification of these critical residues was determined by subdividing the mouse CH2 into 4 parts (A: EU positions 231 to 261; B: EU positions 319 to 340; C: EU positions 296-318 and D: EU positions 262 to 295) and introducing for each of the 4 sub-regions the corresponding CH2 amino acid sequence of a human IgG1 (see FIG. 6A). The sub-division of the mouse CH2 into four subregions was purely based on amino acid sequence homology with the human CH2. The four heavy chain mutants were engineered by overlapping PCR and recombinant MAbs expressed in PEAK. The corresponding antibodies were purified from transfected-cell supernatants by protein G affinity column chromatography and binding to CHO stable cell line expressing human TLR4-MD2 complex on their surface of the following antibodies was determined: muCH2-chimeric IgG1 15C1; chimeric IgG1 15C1; A mu 231-261 CH2 chimeric IgG1 15C1; B mu 319-340 CH2 chimeric IgG1 15C1; C mu 296-318 CH2 chimeric IgG1 15C1; and D mu 262-295 CH2 chimeric IgG1 15C1. 4\u00d7105 cells/well were incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in 50 \u03bcl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-1% BSA) and either serial dilution of the appropriate antibody or an irrelevant human IgG1 isotype control.

In order to determine amongst these 7 residues those which are critical for maintaining the biological activity, the effect of exchanging the residues of mouse IgG1 with those of human IgG1 was examined. To this end, starting from chimeric IgG1 15C1 containing the mouse CH2 region EU position 319 to 340, a set of 5 mutants were engineered using the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene (mutants A to E in FIG. 8B).

PEAK cells were co-transfected with 1 ug of combinations of expression vectors encoding 15C1 humanized VH mutant 1 or 2 together with 15C1 humanized VL A26 or 15C1 humanized VH 4-28 together with 15C1 humanized VL mutant 1, 2, 3 or 4 shown in Example 4 using the Trans IT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corporation, Madison Wis.). All transfections were carried out in duplicates. 72 h post-transfection, PEAK cells supernatants were collected and the concentration of recombinant human IgG1/Kappa measured by ELISA. The antibody concentrations of all the supernatants were then adjusted to 0.33 \u03bcg/ml. These supernatants and two serial dilutions of 0.11 and 0.04 ug/ml were then tested for binding to CHO cells expressing human TLR4-MD2 at their surface by FACS. 5\u00d7105 cells were incubated with the diluted PEAK supernatant for 1 h at 4\u00b0 C. Following two washes, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) in the FL-4 channel (FIGS. 17A-17G). The binding of the humanized mutant versions of 15C1 to TLR4 in FIGS. 17A-17G is expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity for the different antibody concentrations. One representative experiment of four. Error bars show \u00b1S.D. The version VH mutant 1 and VL mutant 2 appear to have a higher MFI than the patented humanized version indicating that these two versions have a higher relative affinity than the humanized version."
