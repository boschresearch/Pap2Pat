    "abstract": "Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of regions of the human genome have been associated with multiple diseases. We present an algorithm which is mathematically sound and computationally efficient to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample utilizing a nanofluidic device, known as the digital array. This numerical algorithm is utilized to compute copy number variation and the associated statistical confidence interval and is based on results from probability theory and statistics. We also provide formulas which can be used as close approximations.",

                        "Digital PCR conventionally utilizes sequential limiting dilutions of target DNA, followed by amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [1], [2]. As a result, it is possible to quantitate single DNA target molecules. We utilize the digital array, which is a novel nanofluidic biochip [2], [3] where digital PCR reactions can be performed (Figure 1) by partitioning DNA molecules, instead of diluting them. This chip utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and reagents into 765 nanolitre volume reaction chambers. DNA molecules in each mixture are randomly partitioned into the 765 chambers of each panel (the total volume of the PCR mix in each panel: 6 nl\u00d7765\u200a=\u200a4.59 \u00b5l). The chip is then thermocycled and imaged on Fluidigm's BioMark real-time PCR system and the positive chambers that originally contained 1 or more molecules can be counted by the digital array analysis software (Figure 2)."

Given the number of molecules per panel and the dilution factor, the concentration of the target sequence in a DNA sample can be accurately calculated. In a multiplex PCR reaction with 2 or more assays, multiple genes can be quantitated simultaneously and independently, effectively eliminating any pipetting errors if separate reactions have to be set up for different genes. When a single copy reference gene (RNase P in this study, [10]) is used in the reaction, the ratio of the target gene to the reference gene would reflect the copy number per haploid genome of the target gene."

The sequences of the primers and FAM-BHQ probe used to amplify this construct are from Emery et al [22]. The primers and probe were ordered from Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA).",
                "Both RPP30 synthetic construct and human genomic DNA NA10860 (Coriell Cell Repositories Camden, NJ) were quantitated using the RPP30 assay on a digital array. Different amounts of RPP30 synthetic construct was then added into the genomic DNA so that mixtures with ratios of RPP30 to RNase P of 1\u22361 (no spike-in), 1\u22361.5, 1\u22362, 1\u22362.5, 1\u22363, and 1\u22363.5 were made simulating DNA samples containing 2 to 7 copies of the RPP30 gene per diploid cell.",
                "These DNA mixtures were analyzed on the digital arrays as described above. Five panels were used for each mixture and 400\u2013500 RNase P molecules were present in each panel. The ratios of RPP30/RNase P of all samples were calculated using the techniques developed in this paper. For each ratio, we did pooled analysis by adding the numbers of positive chambers in the first P\u200a=\u200a1,2,3,4,5 panels. The results are summarized in the previous section and in Figure 8."
