                        "The present invention relates generally to nanofluidic techniques. In particular, the invention provides a method and system for computing copy number variation in a DNA sample using digital PCR. More particularly, the present method and system partitions a DNA sample into a number of separate reaction chambers present in a nanofluidic chip forming a digital array. Merely by way of example, the nanofluidic methods and systems described herein are used to determine accurate estimates for concentrations of target gene and reference gene molecules in a biological sample as well as ratios of the determined concentrations. Although the techniques for nanofluidic systems are applied to digital PCR using digital arrays, it would be recognized that the invention has a much broader range of applicability.",
                        "Some conventional digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques utilize sequential limiting dilutions of target DNA followed by amplification using PCR. Using this digital PCR technique, it is possible to quantitate single DNA target molecules. Another digital PCR technique utilizes a microfluidic biochip in which DNA molecules are partitioned rather than diluted. As an example, the microfluidic biochip typically utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and reagents into reaction chambers having nanolitre volumes. DNA molecules in each mixture are randomly partitioned into the various chambers of the biochip, the chip is thermocycled, and the chip is imaged to determine the number of reaction chambers having a desired DNA molecule.",
                        "Copy number variation (CNV) is the gain or loss of genomic regions which range from 500 bases on upwards in size. Whole genome studies have revealed the presence of large numbers of CNV regions in human DNA and a broad range of genetic diversity among the general population. Copy number variations have been the focus of a number of recent studies as a result of their role in human genetic disorders.",
                        "Current whole-genome scanning technologies use array-based platforms (array-CGH and high-density SNP microarrays) to study CNVs. These approaches are characterized by high throughput, but lack resolution and sensitivity. Real-time PCR is a sequence-specific technique that is easy to perform, but is limited in its discriminating power beyond a 2-fold difference. CNV determination using a digital array is based upon the ability to partition DNA sequences. Given the number of molecules per panel and the dilution factor, the concentration of the target sequence in a DNA sample can be accurately calculated.",
                        "In a multiplex PCR reaction with 2 or more assays, multiple genes can be quantitated simultaneously and independently, effectively eliminating any pipetting errors if separate reactions have to be set up for different genes. When a single copy reference gene (e.g., RNase P) is used in the reaction, the ratio of the target gene to the reference gene would reflect the copy number per haploid genome of the target gene.",
                        "DNA quantitation in the digital array is based on the partitioning of a PCR reaction into an array of several hundreds or even a few thousands of reaction chambers or wells. If a DNA sample only includes several DNA molecules of interest in the sample, most of the reaction chambers in a digital PCR chip will include either one or no molecules. Thus, to first order, the number of positive reaction chambers at the PCR end-point provides a count of the molecules of interest in the sample. However, if the number of molecules of interest is large compared to the number of reaction chambers, it is likely that a number of the reaction chambers will include more than one molecule of interest and the positive reaction chamber count will be significantly less than the number of molecules of interest. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved methods and systems for estimating the number of molecules in a DNA sample."

                        "The conventional view in human genetics held that genes were always present in two copies per diploid cell. After the completion of the human genome project about five years ago, it is now clear that some genes are present in multiple copies in different individuals, and that occasionally huge regions of the genome are duplicated or deleted. Such copy number variation (CNV) is now known to be associated with many human diseases. Copy number variations (CNVs) can be determined using a technique known as Digital PCR in which DNA samples are quantitated using limiting dilutions. Another technique, rather than using limiting dilutions, utilizes a nanofluidic chip called a digital array, which partitions individual DNA molecules in separate reaction chambers. The digital array chip utilizes integrated channels and valves that partition mixtures of sample and reagents into, for example, 765 reaction chambers, each with volumes on the scale of nanoliters.",

Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems, which are mathematically sound and computationally efficient, to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample. These methods and systems are applicable to the technology of the digital array as well as other DNA analysis techniques. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems to accurately estimate the true concentration of the molecules in the DNA sample and then determine the ratios of different sequences along with statistical confidence intervals on these estimations. Some embodiments of the present invention utilize theories of statistics and probability whereas other embodiments utilize numerical algorithms and formulas that provide close approximations for the true concentration of molecules in a DNA sample.",

Warren et al., a Bayesian approach is utilized in which given the number of positive chambers in a panel, one computes the number of molecules for this particular experiment. In the Bayesian approach, one assumes some prior probability distribution on the number of molecules and builds a probability distribution of getting the observed number of positive chambers for each possible number of molecules. In the preprint by Warren et al., a uniform distribution of number of molecules was assumed, with a maximum number assumed to be 4000, and using Bayesian and combinatorial methods, the digital PCR response curve was calculated.

As illustrated in FIG. 1, the nanofluidic biochip, also referred to as a digital array, includes a carrier 110, which may be made from materials providing suitable mechanical support for the various elements of the nanofluidic biochip. As an example, the biochip is made using an elastomeric polymer. The outer portion of the biochip has the same footprint as a standard 384-well microplate and enables stand-alone valve operation. As described below, there are 12 input ports corresponding to 12 separate sample inputs to the chip. The biochip has 12 panels 105 and each of the 12 panels contains 765 6 nl reaction chambers with a total volume of 4.59 \u03bcl per panel.

In applications in which reagents are not utilized, inlets 122 and reagent side accumulator 120 may not be used. Additionally, two inlets 132 are provided in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 to provide hydration to the biochip. Hydration inlets 132 are in fluid communication with the biochip to facilitate the control of humidity associated with the reaction chambers. As will be understood to one of skill in the art, some elastomeric materials utilized in the fabrication of the biochip are gas permeable, allowing evaporated gases or vapor from the reaction chambers to pass through the elastomeric material into the surrounding atmosphere. In a particular embodiment, fluid lines located at peripheral portions of the biochip provide a shield of hydration liquid, for example, a buffer or master mix, at peripheral portions of the biochip surrounding the panels of reaction chambers, thus reducing or preventing evaporation of liquids present in the reaction chambers. Thus, humidity at peripheral portions of the biochip can be increased by adding a volatile liquid, for example water, to hydration inlets 132. In a specific embodiment, a first inlet is in fluid communication with the hydration fluid lines surrounding the panels on a first side of the biochip and the second inlet is in fluid communication with the hydration fluid lines surrounding the panels on the other side of the biochip.",

In one embodiment, the reaction chamber is from about 2 nL to about 50 nL, preferably 2 nL to about 25 nL, more preferably from about 4 nL to about 15 nL.

As illustrated in FIG. 12, the excitation optical signal is directed, through reflection by optical illuminator 250, refraction, or combinations thereof, to impinge on a surface of the microfluidic device 205. As illustrated in FIG. 12, illumination of the microfluidic device is via optical illuminator 250. In other embodiments illumination may be coupled to the microfluidic device obliquely from one or more sides of device, via a ring light, or via a portion of the collection optical train (the optical path between the microfluidic device and the detector 260.",

In these embodiments, a large field of view is provided, which enables the performance of fluorescence applications that involve imaging of time resolved chemical processes and reactions. As an example, fluorescent imaging of protein calorimetry and nucleic acid amplification processes are time resolved processes that benefit from embodiments of the present invention. In some of these processes, simultaneously excitation of the fluorescent samples provided in a number of reaction chambers and simultaneous collection of the fluorescent signals produced by the reactions occurring in the number of reaction chambers is desirable. In other processes, for instance, fluorescence lifetime imaging, a brief excitation pulse is followed by detection (and analysis) of the fluorescent signal as it decays in time from an initial level. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.",
                        "As an example, nucleic acid amplification processes typically include the target DNA, a thermostable DNA polymerase, two oligonucleotide primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), a reaction buffer, and magnesium. Once assembled, the reaction is placed in a thermal cycler, an instrument that subjects the reaction to a series of different temperatures for varying amounts of time. This series of temperature and time adjustments is referred to as one cycle of amplification. Each cycle theoretically doubles the amount of targeted sequence (amplicon) in the reaction. Ten cycles theoretically multiply the amplicon by a factor of about one thousand; 20 cycles, by a factor of more than a million in a matter of hours. In some applications, it is desirable to acquire fluorescent imaging data from a large area (e.g., on the order of several cm2) in a time period ranging from seconds to minutes.",

Merely by way of example, in an embodiment of the present invention a method of imaging microfluidic devices is provided. The method includes capturing an image of a spatial region associated with at least a determined number of chambers of a microfluidic device using an image detection spatial region during a time frame of less than one minute, whereupon the capturing of the image of the spatial region is substantially free from a stitching and/or scanning process.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention provide a variety of time frames for image capture, ranging from 1 millisecond to 1 minute. In some embodiments, time frames for image capture are greater than one minute. Depending on the emission properties associated with the processes performed in the chambers of the microfluidic device, the time frame for image capture will vary. For example, in an embodiment, the time frame is 10 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 250 ms, 500 ms, 750 ms, or 1 second. In other embodiments, the time frame is 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, or 1 minute. Of course, the time frame will depend on the particular applications.",
                        "In some embodiments, the image capture process is performed in a synchronous manner, capturing an image of a determined number of chambers simultaneously. As an example, in an exemplary PCR process, the microfluidic device is maintained at a temperature of 90\u00b0 C. for a time period of 15 seconds. Subsequently, the microfluidic device is maintained at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. for 45 seconds. The heating and cooling cycle is repeated at a one minute cycle period for a number of cycles. Utilizing embodiments of the present invention, images of a determined number of chambers present in the microfluidic device are acquired synchronously, while the chambers are maintained at a uniform temperate as a function of position. For example, a two-dimensional image of an entire microfluidic device may be acquired utilizing a 30 second exposure while the microfluidic device is maintained at the temperature of 60\u00b0 C. One of skill in the art will appreciate the benefits provided by the present invention over raster scanning or stitching systems, in which images of chambers in a first portion (e.g., an upper left quadrant) of the microfluidic device are acquired prior to images of chambers in a second portion (e.g., a lower right quadrant) of the microfluidic device.",
                        "In other embodiments, multiple images are acquired of the determined number of chambers during a time frame of less than one minute. As an example of these embodiments, multiple images associated with multiple fluorophores are acquired in a particular embodiment. During the 45 second time period during which the microfluidic device is maintained at the temperature of 60\u00b0 C., three consecutive images utilizing exposures of 15 seconds may be acquired for three different fluorophores, for example, Rox\u2122, Vic\u00ae, and Fam\u2122. Utilizing these multiple images, differential fluorescence ratios can be calculated and analyzed. Of course, depending on the strength of the fluorescent emissions, the exposure times for the various fluorophores may be modified as appropriate the particular application. In this way, embodiments of the present invention provide for imaging of a microfluidic device in multiple spectral bands while the microfluidic device is maintained a constant temperature. The constant temperature, as illustrated by the previous example, may be a portion of a PCR process including cyclical temperature processes.",

For example, change in resistance of a thermistor fabricated on an underlying semiconductor substrate utilizing conventional techniques can be calibrated to a given temperature change. Alternatively, a thermistor could be inserted directly into the microfabricated elastomer material. Still another approach to detection of temperature by resistance is described in Wu et al. in \u201cMEMS Flow Sensors for Nano-fluidic Applications\u201d, Sensors and Actuators A 89 152-158 (2001), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

                        "A particular embodiment of the present invention utilizes a detector in the form of a CCD camera and an optical path that provides for a large field of view and a high numerical aperture to maximize the amount of light collected from each reaction chamber, thereby increasing detection sensitivity. In this embodiment, the CCD is used as an array of photodetectors wherein each pixel or group of pixels corresponds to a reaction chamber rather than being used to produce an image of the array. Thus, the optics may be designed or altered such that image quality is reduced or the image is blurred at the detector in order to increase the useable depth of field of the optical system to collect more light from each reaction chamber. Particularly because the assays contemplated in some embodiments of the present invention include biological assays using fluorescent dyes, which dyes photobleach due to exposure to excitation light hence limiting the total number of signal photons obtainable from a given sample, efficient collection of the limited signal photons can be of importance in instruments such as that discussed. Etendue considerations relate the object and image NA (numerical aperture) and total system magnification for any optical system; since image-side NA can be limited (e.g. by reflection losses at the CCD surface for high-incident-angle rays), in general, arbitrarily high object (sample)-side NA is not achievable simultaneously with arbitrary system magnification. In fact, a larger system magnification can allow a higher object-side NA without requiring a simultaneous (and potentially deleterious for reasons described above) rise in image-side NA. Consequently, in the system described, a large CCD (e.g., 30.7 mm\u00d730.7 mm) focal-plane array has been used to allow for a 1:1 optical system (i.e., a system magnification of 1). This allows a collection NA of 0.36 simultaneous with an image-side NA of 0.36 onto the CCD, which provides reasonable performance with respect to surface reflection losses.",
                        "In some embodiments, larger object-side NAs result in reduced object-side depth-of-focus, and hence larger blurring at the detector (assuming blur due to depth of focus greater than or equal to blur due to lens aberrations and other issues) for a given depth of reaction chamber in the sample, limiting the allowable minimum spacing between reaction chambers at the sample if low crosstalk in signal between chambers is to be achieved. In conjunction with a 1:1 optical system, this object-side NA consideration is in good keeping with the 0.5 NA maximum generally desirable NA onto a CCD (or silicon detector) if one is to avoid reflection losses at the surface thereof. The 1:1 imaging lens system is furthermore inherently free of most odd-order aberrations, increasing the advantage of this particular magnification (M=1). The use of a 1:1 optical system with a detector as large or larger than the microfluidic system to be imaged is thus provided by some embodiments of the present invention as a design for the detailed system.",
                        "In other embodiments, there may be a cost constraint related to the size of the detector (e.g. a CCD focal-plane array). For example, some current high quantum-efficiency, full-frame CCD arrays have dimensions of 27.6 mm\u00d727.6 mm. This detector is slightly smaller than a microfluidic device with dimensions of 30.7 mm\u00d730.7 mm, resulting in a system magnification of 0.88 as a design for the system described. Being near system magnification M=1, constraints related to the detector (image-side) incident NA described above are satisfied for such a magnification.",
                        "In other embodiments, a given XY-plane (perpendicular to the optical axis) spacing and size of the reaction chambers may be specified (e.g. to achieve a desired density of sample-chambers in the XY-plane), while constraints on the minimum total volume of the chambers remain (e.g. to achieve minimum required chemical volumes, for instance to avoid over-large statistical fluctuations due to small numbers of reagent or target molecules, or simply to achieve a required minimum number of fluorescent or otherwise optically-emitting molecules or objects). In such a case, it may be necessary to extend the chambers parallel to the Z (optical)-axis such that the total volume of each chamber remains equal to or greater than some minimum figure. Greater extension along Z (creating high-aspect ratio, or columnar chambers which concentrate the sample to be interrogated along the Z-axis) will generally result in a larger blur of the chamber image at the detector for given object-side NA, due to depth-of-focus considerations, assuming blur due to depth of focus is greater than or equal to blur due to lens aberrations and other issues. In some situations, this will lead to the user of a lower object-side NA. Use of a lower NA lens system allows for greater depth of focus and hence light collection from a chambers extended parallel to the optic axis without generally incurring inordinate crosstalk in the optical signal between adjacent or nearby chambers. In this way, a greater density of chambers in the X-Y plane (the place perpendicular to the optic axis) may be used without inordinate crosstalk, while the total chamber volume may be kept large by extension of the chambers in Z (parallel to the optic axis). In this case, or other cases where a lower object-side NA is acceptable (e.g., cases where a larger XY spacing of reaction chambers allows for more chamber-image blur at the detector without undue crosstalk; in non-light-limited applications, where higher NA is not essential; where there is sufficient sample that photobleaching is not an issue; non-photobleaching samples, circumstances such as lower acceptable system sensitivity), a lower system magnification (M<1) may be suitable, particularly if M\u2267NAo/0.5, or more preferably M\u2267NAo/0.36, where NAo=object side NA, or more generally M\u2267NAo/NAdet where NAdet=maximum NA allowable onto the detector face without overlarge reflection/insertion losses to the detector (NAdet=0.36 to 0.5 for a typical CCD).",
                        "In cases where object-side depth-of-focus and/or blur requirements do not necessitate an object-side NA\u22660.36, or possibly 0.5, or more generally NAo\u2266NAdet, a larger detector is desirable since due to Etendue considerations (as discussed above), since a larger M (generally requiring a larger detector for a given sample size) will allow a smaller NAi (image-side NA) for a given NAo. Hence where light-collection requirements (e.g. to achieve a certain assay sensitivity) call for a large NAo (defined by NAo>NAdet) and depth-of-focus and other design considerations (e.g. cost) allow for a large NAo, a larger M is desirable such that losses are minimized at the detector. In such embodiments it can be useful to use a detector device, for example, one or more CCD devices, having a size of, or larger than, the area of the microfluidic device to be imaged. Use of such a large detector allows an increase in the magnification of the optical system, and hence (via etendue considerations) higher NA light collection from the sample for a fixed incident NA onto the detector (the latter set, e.g., by reflection losses at the CCD surface at high incoming ray incident angles).",
                        "A particularly preferred detector uses a CCD camera and an optical path that provides for a large field of view and a high numerical aperture to maximize the amount of light collected from each reaction chamber, thereby increasing detection sensitivity. In this regard, the CCD is used as an array of photodetectors wherein each pixel or group of pixels corresponds to a reaction chamber rather than being used to produce an image of the array. Thus, the optics may be altered such that image quality is reduced or defocused to increase the depth of field of the optical system to collect more light from each reaction chamber. In some embodiments, it is useful to employ high aspect ratio, or columnar chambers, to concentrate the sample to be interrogated by the detector along the optical axis of the optical system, and preferably by defocussing the image to increase the depth of field. Use of a low NA lens system, preferably a bilaterally symmetrical lens system is used. It is also useful to use a detector device, for example, one or more CCD devices, having a size of, or larger than, the area of the microfluidic device to be imaged. Used in conjunction with the low NA optics, improved detection sensitivity can be realized.",

                        "As illustrated in FIG. 12, some embodiments of the present invention provide a 1:1 imaging system adapted to generate and detect fluorescent, chemiluminescent, bioluminescent, and other signals from the microfluidic device. A 1:1 imaging system is provided in some embodiments that utilizes an image detection device as large as the sample to be imaged. By providing 1:1 imaging of a large field of view, on the order of several cm2, embodiments of the present invention provide increased numerical aperture (NA) optical systems. Because light collection efficiency is approximately proportional to NA2, the increase in NA provided by some embodiments of the present invention enable the collection of suitable fluorescent signals from reaction chambers comprising reaction volumes on the order of one to tens of nanoliters and active fluorophore concentrations on the order of 1.0 nanoMolar. In other embodiments, active fluorophore concentrations in picoMolar ranges provide suitable fluorescent signals.",
                        "Additionally, embodiments of the present invention provide for imaging systems that are slightly reducing, forming, for example, an image that ranges from about the same size as the object to about half the object size. For example, in an embodiment, an image of a spatial region of a microfluidic device is transmitted and captured, the spatial region being associated with more than 96 chambers. An image detecting device is used to capture the image of the spatial region using an image detection spatial region that is about equal to or slightly less in size than the spatial region of the microfluidic device. Merely by way of example, the ratio of the area of the spatial region of the microfluidic device to the area of the image of the spatial region can be 1:1, 1:0.99, 1:0.95, 1:0.9, 1:0.88, and 1:0.85. These particular ratios are merely exemplary, as the ratio selected for the imaging system will depend on the particular application.",
                        "In some embodiments, the optical imaging system includes a field of view of about 3 cm\u00d73 cm. In other embodiments, the optical imaging system includes a field of view that ranges from about 1 cm\u00d71 cm to about 5 cm\u00d75 cm. In particular embodiments, an object field of view of 2 cm\u00d72 cm, 2.5 cm\u00d72.5 cm, 2.76 cm\u00d72.76 cm, 3.07 cm\u00d73.07 cm, 3.5 cm\u00d73.5 cm, and 4 cm\u00d74 cm, is provided. In general, the field of view of the optical imaging system is selected to correspond to the spatial region of the microfluidic device, for example, an area including a number of reaction chambers of interest.",
                        "Moreover, embodiments of the present invention provide optical imaging systems with a range of numerical apertures. As an example, an NA ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 is provided according to various embodiments. In a particular embodiment, NAs of 0.15, 0.18, 0.2, 0.23, 0.25, 0.3, 0.36, and 0.4 are provided.",
                        "The spatial resolution of the optical imaging system will generally be a function of the size of the pixels in the image detecting device. In some embodiments of the present invention, the magnification (equal to one for some embodiments) and the size of the pixels present in the detector will determine the number of pixels associated with each reaction chamber. Generally, it is preferable to have multiple detector pixels associated with each reaction chamber. For example, if a reaction chamber is 45 \u03bcm on a side, up to nine square pixels having a side dimension equal to 15 \u03bcm will overlap with the reaction chamber in the 1:1 imaging system. Thus, according to embodiments of the present invention, the number of pixels associated with each reaction chamber ranges from 1 to 100. For example, 4 pixel regions, 9 pixel regions, 16 pixel regions, 25 pixel regions, 36 pixel regions, 49 pixel regions, 64 pixel regions, and 81 pixel regions are associated with each reaction chamber according to some embodiments of the present invention.",
                        "In embodiments of the present invention, a range of pixel sizes from 1 \u03bcm2 to 900 \u03bcm2 are utilized. For example, square pixels 1 \u03bcm on a side, 2 \u03bcm on a side, 3 \u03bcm on a side, 4 \u03bcm on a side, 5 \u03bcm on a side, 10 \u03bcm on a side, 13.5 \u03bcm on a side, 15 \u03bcm on a side, 20 \u03bcm on a side, 25 \u03bcm on a side, and 30 \u03bcm on a side are utilized in various embodiments of the present invention. As will be evident to one of skill in the art, the pixel size, the detector array dimensions, and the number of pixels per array are related. In alternative embodiments, rectangular pixels with pixel areas ranging from 1 \u03bcm2 to 900 \u03bcm2 are utilized.",
                        "Moreover, detector arrays, also referred to as image detecting devices, including a range of pixel counts are utilized according to various embodiments of the present invention. Array dimensions range from 512\u00d7512 pixel regions to 3,000\u00d73,000 pixel regions. Depending on the availability of detector arrays, greater numbers of pixels per array may be provided in some embodiments. In particular embodiments, array dimensions of 1,024\u00d71,024 pixel regions and 2,048 by 2,048 pixel regions are utilized.",
                        "Embodiments of the present invention provide an optical imaging system characterized by several system parameters.
