    "title": "Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells",
    "date": "2015-10-01",
    "abstract": "Intestinal Th17 cells are induced and accumulate in response to colonization with a subgroup of intestinal microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) and certain extracellular pathogens. Here, we show that adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells (ECs) is a critical cue for Th17 induction. Upon monocolonization of germ-free mice or rats with SFB indigenous to mice (M-SFB) or rats (R-SFB), M-SFB and R-SFB showed host-specific adhesion to small intestinal ECs, accompanied by host-specific induction of Th17 cells. Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli O157 triggered similar Th17 responses, whereas adhesion-defective mutants of these microbes failed to do so. Moreover, a mixture of 20 bacterial strains, which were selected and isolated from fecal samples of a patient with ulcerative colitis on the basis of their ability to cause a robust induction of Th17 cells in the mouse colon, also exhibited EC-adhesive characteristics.",

                "The gut microbiota contributes to the constitutive development of Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) (Atarashi et al., 2008;Ivanov et al., 2008). Among commensals, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are one of the most potent inducers of Th17 cells, and monocolonization of mice with SFB causes abundant accumulation of Th17 cells in the small intestinal (SI) LP (Gaboriau-Routhiau et al., 2009;Ivanov et al., 2009). Recent reports have shown that most of the intestinal Th17 cells induced by SFB have T cell receptors (TCRs) that specifically recognize SFB antigens (Goto et al., 2014;Yang et al., 2014). However, since the SFB antigens themselves do not dictate Th17 differentiation (Yang et al., 2014), and microbiota-mediated Th17 cell development occurs independently of major innate immune receptors (Atarashi et al., 2008;Ivanov et al., 2009), SFB colonization must elicit unique signaling pathways in the intestine to generate a Th17-conducive environment.",
                "SFB are spore-forming gram-positive bacteria with a segmented and filamentous morphology, and tight adhesion to SI epithelial cells (ECs) is a remarkable characteristic feature of these bacteria (Davis and Savage, 1974). SFB are widely distributed in vertebrates (Klaasen et al., 1993). In spite of the morphological similarities of SFB isolated from various hosts, their 16S rRNA gene sequences differ, and several reports suggest that SFB have undergone host species-specific selection and adaptation (Chung et al., 2012). The complete genomic sequences of SFB colonizing the mouse and rat intestines, referred to as M-SFB and R-SFB, respectively, were determined. Although the overall genomic organization of M-SFB and R-SFB are similar, 5%-10% of the genes are specific to each strain, and the amino acid sequence identity between orthologous gene pairs is on average 80% (Prakash et al., 2011). Analysis of differences between M-SFB and R-SFB may be useful to improve understanding of the effects of SFB on the immune system.",
                "In addition to SFB colonization, infections with several extracellular pathogens such as Candida albicans and Citrobacter rodentium are known to induce Th17 cells (Conti and Gaffen, 2010;Mangan et al., 2006). Th17 cells induce the recruitment of neutrophils and activation of ECs, leading to enhanced clearance of extracellular pathogens in concert with other immune cells such as IgA-secreting plasma cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). The induction of Th17 cells by those pathogens has been postulated to be mediated by the local cytokine milieu produced by intestinal ECs and specific subsets of myeloid cells (Weaver et al., 2013). However, it remains unclear which features of these particular microbes specifically elicit Th17 versus other types of immune cell responses at intestinal mucosal sites.",
                "Because SFB and C. rodentium commonly adhere to ECs, we hypothesized that adhesionmediated activation of ECs plays a pivotal role in the induction of Th17 cells. Accordingly, we examined the ability of M-SFB, R-SFB, wild-type, and mutant strains of C. rodentium and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 to adhere to ECs and induce Th17 cells. In addition, by combining gnotobiotic technique and anaerobic culturing of members of the intestinal microbiota from a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC), we isolated 20 strains based on their ability to induce Th17 cells in mice and examined EC-adhesive characteristics of these 20 Th17-inducing human strains. Our findings indicate that adhesion to ECs is a common mechanism used by intestinal microbes to activate host Th17 responses."

                        "C57BL/6 (B6) or IQI germ-free (GF) mice were orally inoculated with R-SFB or M-SFB, and their intestinal colonization was monitored by qPCR analysis. The concentration of fecal and SI luminal R-SFB DNA quickly increased and reached a plateau within 1 week; the kinetics and levels were comparable to those of M-SFB (Figures 1A andS1A). Consistent with the qPCR results, Gram-stained smears of cecal luminal contents contained equivalent numbers of R-SFB and M-SFB with indistinguishable morphology (Figure S1B), indicating that R-SFB and M-SFB both colonize and grow robustly within the mouse intestinal lumen. In contrast, when SI mucosa-associated SFB DNA amounts were examined, we detected much lower levels of R-SFB than of M-SFB (Figure 1A). We also performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of washed SI mucosa to visualize EC-adhering SFB. Numerous M-SFB were observed adhering tightly to the mouse SI epithelium. In contrast, we did not detect any R-SFB adhering to SI ECs (Figures 1B andS1C). R-SFB also failed to adhere to SI ECs in monocolonized Rag1 -/-mice or IL-2Rg -/-Rag2 -/-mice (Figures S1D andS1E), making it unlikely that the impaired adhesion of R-SFB to mouse SI ECs was due to a R-SFB-specific reaction by the mouse immune system. Although we detected some ECadhering M-SFB and R-SFB in the mouse colon, these were less frequent than in the SI (Figure 1B).",
                        "We then investigated the effects of monocolonization of mice with M-SFB or R-SFB on the induction of Th17 cells. In agreement with previous reports (Gaboriau-Routhiau et al., 2009;Ivanov et al., 2009), a robust accumulation of Th17 cells was observed in the SI LP of B6 or IQI mice monocolonized with M-SFB. In contrast, R-SFB colonization had no significant effect on the number of Th17 cells (Figures 1C and1D). Notably, both M-SFB and R-SFB induced the accumulation of Th17 cells in the colonic LP, although less efficiently than that in the SI LP following M-SFB colonization (Figure 1D), correlating with the EC adhesion efficacy of the SFB.",
                        "We next performed the reciprocal experiment by monocolonizing GF F344 rats with R-SFB or M-SFB. After oral inoculation of GF rats with R-SFB, high levels of R-SFB DNA were detected in feces and SI mucosal tissues by qPCR (Figure 1E). Examination of the rat SI mucosal surface by SEM revealed the frequent presence of R-SFB adhering tightly to the follicular-associated epithelium (FAE) and villous ECs (Figure 1F). In contrast, far fewer M-SFB associated with the rat SI ECs, although the amount of M-SFB and R-SFB DNA in the feces was comparable (Figures 1E and1F). We then investigated the effects of R-SFB and M-SFB monocolonization on Th17 cells in rats. The frequency of Th17 cells in the SI LP was markedly increased after monocolonization of GF rats with R-SFB, whereas M-SFB-monocolonization induced only a slight increase in the frequency of these cells (Figures 1G and 1H). Taken together, adhesion of SFB to intestinal ECs is a host-specific event and strongly correlates with Th17 cell induction."

                        "To examine whether EC adhesion is required for priming SFB antigen-specific Th17 cell differentiation, we generated mice co-colonized with M-SFB and R-SFB and assessed the antigen specificity of the SI LP Th17 cells. In the feces of co-colonized mice, similar amounts of M-SFB and R-SFB DNA were detected (Figure S2A). SI LP cells, which include T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), were isolated from the co-colonized mice, and stimulated ex vivo either with PMA and ionomycin (P/I) or with autoclaved cecal content from GF, M-SFB-, or R-SFB-monocolonized mice. Cytokine expression was analyzed as a readout for TCR activation. Although less efficient than P/I, the M-SFB antigens evoked IL-17 expression in a significant number of cells (Figures 2A and2B). In contrast, the R-SFB antigens elicited no response. Therefore, a substantial fraction of Th17 cells that accumulated in the SI LP of co-colonized mice had TCRs specific to the ECadhering M-SFB, but not to the non-adhering R-SFB. These results suggest that antigens from EC-adhering SFB are taken up and presented by APCs much more efficiently than those of non-adhering SFB.",
                        "Recently, two major protein antigens responsible for M-SFB-mediated SI LP Th17 cell induction were identified (SFBNYU_003340 and SFBNYU_004990) (Yang et al., 2014). We analyzed the R-SFB genome and identified the gene encoding the orthologous protein corresponding to SFBNYU_003340, but could not identify an SFBNYU_004990 ortholog. The minimal epitope within M-SFB SFBNYU_003340 was mapped as QFSGAVPNK (Yang et al., 2014), and the corresponding epitope region in R-SFB was found to be QFNGQVPNN. The M-SFB epitope peptide efficiently induced a Th17 response when added to the ex vivo cultures of SI LP cells isolated from specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice (Figure S2B). In contrast, the same SI LP cells had no reactivity to the R-SFB peptide QFNGQVPNN. Therefore, peptides serving as dominant antigens for SI LP Th17 cell induction in mice are specifically expressed by M-SFB."

                        "SFB colonization has been shown to enhance IgA production (Talham et al., 1999;Umesaki et al., 1999). Consistent with these reports, monocolonization of B6 mice with M-SFB induced a significant increase in the levels of fecal IgA and frequencies of IgA + CD138 + plasma cells in the SI LP (Figures 2C and S2C). In contrast, R-SFB monocolonization in mice resulted in a weak IgA response (Figures 2C and S2C). We also examined IgA production in SFB monocolonized rats. Fecal IgA levels were substantially increased after monocolonization of GF rats with R-SFB, whereas M-SFB-mono-colonization induced only a modest increase (Figure 2C). These findings suggest that luminal colonization is insufficient for the full induction of IgA + cells, but instead an interaction between SFB and ECs is required, which is similar to Th17 cells.",
                        "Next, we examined the effects of SFB colonization on ILC3s, which share many features with Th17 cells (Spits et al., 2013). Thy1 + CD3 -ROR\u03b3t + cells corresponding to ILC3s were much more abundant in the SI LP of SPF B6 mice than in the spleen (Figure S2D), and ~70% of these cells became positive for IL-22 after ex vivo stimulation with IL-23 (Figure 2D). Although the abundance of SI LP ILC3s in GF versus SPF mice did not differ significantly, the frequency of IL-22-proficient (IL-22 + ) cells among ILC3s was dramatically decreased in GF mice (Figure 2D). Monocolonization of mice with M-SFB resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of IL-22 + SI ILC3s, although the level did not reach that observed in SPF mice (Figure 2D). The increase in IL-22 + cells upon monocolonization with M-SFB was observed for both NKp46 + and NKp46 -ILC3 populations (Figure S2E). Interestingly, R-SFB induced a significant increase in the frequency of IL-22 + cells with a magnitude similar to that of M-SFB (Figure 2D). The induction of IL-22 + ILC3s was also observed in mice inoculated with feces from Jackson Laboratory (JAX) SPF mice, which are known to be devoid of SFB (Ivanov et al., 2009) (Figure 2D), indicating that IL-22 + ILC3s can be induced by non-adhering SFB and even by non-SFB commensals, which is in contrast to Th17 and IgA + cells."

                        "We next examined the influence of SFB adhesion on SI EC gene expression profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The expression of several genes was highly upregulated in SI ECs of M-SFB-colonized mice compared to GF and R-SFB-colonized mice (Figures 3A andS3A). The upregulated genes included three isoforms of serum amyloid A (SAA), regenerating islet-derived protein 3 \u03b2 (Reg3\u03b2) and Reg3\u03b3 and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2). The expression differences of selected genes were confirmed by qPCR analysis (Figures 3B and S3B). Elevated levels of SAA1 protein in SI ECs of M-SFB-monocolonized mice were clearly visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 3C). Recombinant SAA1 markedly enhanced the in vitro differentiation of naive CD4 + T cells into Th17 cells mediated by CD11c + cells, IL-6, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) (Figure 3D). This SAA1-mediated enhancement was severely attenuated in the absence of CD11c + cells or of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, or in the presence of an anti-IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) blocking antibody (Figures 3D and3E). In fact, SAA1 elevated the expression level of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in splenic CD11c + cells (Figure 3F). Therefore, the current data extend previous studies reporting that SAAs are induced in SI ECs by colonization with SFB (Ivanov et al., 2009) and suggest that SAA induction requires SFB adhesion to ECs. Furthermore, the SAAs produced by this mechanism likely condition neighboring CD11c + myeloid cells to produce IL-1\u03b2 and probably other factors that act with IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 to enhance Th17 cell differentiation.",
                        "In addition to the increase in SAAs, mRNA levels of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)generating enzyme dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) and of its maturation factor Duoxa2 were also highly up-regulated in SI ECs in M-SFB-monocolonized mice (Figures 3A and3B). Treatment of M-SFB-monocolonized mice with a ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), in the drinking water significantly limited Th17 cell induction (Figure 3G) without affecting adhesion of M-SFB to SI ECs (Figure S3C). Therefore, EC-adhering SFB affect Th17 cell accumulation via integration of a number of different molecular mechanisms including production of SAAs and ROS by ECs.",
                        "Toward an understanding of the molecular basis of adherent SFB-mediated SAA induction, we explored the transcriptional regulatory elements of the Saa1 gene locus. We identified two DNase I hypersensitive sites downstream of the Saa1 gene, which were uniquely active in the SI and distinguished by acetylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) active enhancer marks (Shen et al., 2012) (Figure 3H). Investigation of publicly available datasets of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for transcription factor (TF) binding (Camp et al., 2014) suggested interactions of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) with both regulatory regions of Saa1 (Figure 3H). Our SI EC RNA-seq data and qPCR analysis showed that C/EBP\u03b4 was specifically upregulated in SI ECs of M-SFBmonocolonized mice (Figures 3I andS3B), suggesting that it may be a key TF regulating SAA1 expression. In line with this finding, we observed co-induction of SAA1 and C/EBP\u03b4 expression in a mouse SI EC line (aMos7) co-cultured with M-SFB in vitro (Figure 3J). Induction of SAA1 and C/EBP\u03b4 expression was observed only when ECs were in direct contact with M-SFB (Figure 3J); under these conditions M-SFB adhesion to the aMoS7 cells was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and SEM (Figures S3D andS3E). The induction of SAA1 and C/EBP\u03b4 expression by M-SFB was further enhanced by the addition of F-actin inhibitory drugs, latrunculin A, or swinholide A (Figure S3F). Therefore, actin reorganization in ECs induced by SFB adhesion may lead to the elevation of C/EBP\u03b4 expression, which then contributes to SAA1 expression."

                        "All of the above experiments were performed using B6 or IQI mice. We next examined the influence of mouse genetic background on intestinal Th17 cell induction. The frequency of Th17 cells in SPF C57BL/10 and B10.D2 mice was similar to that in B6 and IQI (ICR) mice (Figure 4A). The only exception was BALB/c mice, which had a much lower frequency of Th17 cells even under SPF conditions or after monocolonization with M-SFB (Figures 4A,4B, and S4A). It is noteworthy that BALB/c mice had substantial numbers of ROR\u03b3t + single-positive cells but had severe reduction of ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + double-positive cells (Figure S4A). M-SFB, but not R-SFB, were found to adhere to SI EC surfaces in BALB/c mice, similar to the results in B6 mice (Figures 4C andS4B) and splenic naive CD4 + T cells from BALB/c mice gave rise to a normal frequency of ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + cells when differentiated under Th17 conditions (Figure S4C), suggesting that SFB adhesion to SI ECs occurs normally and that CD4 + T cells do not have an intrinsic differentiation defect, but instead that EC activation and/or subsequent LP cell signaling required for ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + Th17 induction may be defective in BALB/c mice. Among Th17-conducting cytokines, microbiota-induced constitutive and high-level expression of IL-1\u03b2 was observed in SI LP CD11c + cells of B6 mice (Figure 4D), which is in line with previous reports (Mortha et al., 2014;Shaw et al., 2012). IL-1\u03b2 expression was significantly reduced in M-SFB-monocolonized and SPF BALB/c mice, compared with that of B6 mice (Figure 4E). Besides the reduced expression of IL-1\u03b2 in CD11c + cells, expression of SAA1/2 was significantly decreased in SI ECs of BALB/c mice (Figures 4F andS4D). Injection of exogenous IL-1\u03b2 into SPF BALB/c mice elevated expression of SAAs in SI ECs (Figure 4G) and this was accompanied by an increase in SI LP ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + Th17 cells (Figures 4J andS4E), suggesting that insufficient IL-1\u03b2 production by LP CD11c + cells is responsible, at least in part, for the reduction in SAA expression and Th17 cell accumulation in BALB/c mice. Consistent with this interpretation, B6 Il1r1 -/-mice phenocopied BALB/c mice, displaying decreased expression of SAAs in SI ECs (Figure 4H) and a significant reduction in the number of SI LP ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + Th17 cells (Figures 4K andS4F). It is noteworthy that IL-1\u03b2 administration induced Th17 cell accumulation in M-SFB-colonized mice, but not in R-SFB-colonized or GF BALB/c mice, revealing a requirement for the presence of EC-adhering bacteria for the IL-1\u03b2 effect (Figures 4J andS4E).",
                        "BALB/c mice had reduced frequencies of IL-22 + cells among ILC3s compared with B6 mice under both SPF and M-SFB-monocolonized conditions, whereas the frequency of IgA + cells was normal (Figures 4B andS4G). An EC-specific deficiency of the IL-22 receptor a1 gene (Vil-Cre crossed with Il22ra1 f/f ) on an SPF B6 background resulted in reduced expression of SAAs by SI ECs (Figure 4I), suggesting that IL-22 from ILC3s, together with IL-1\u03b2 from CD11c + cells, act on SI ECs to potentiate their expression of SAA. Vil-Cre crossed with Il22ra1 f/f mice showed a tendency toward reduction of ROR\u03b3t + IL-17 + Th17 cells in the SI LP (Figure S4H). Therefore, adhesive SFB may create a complex circuitry of interactions between ECs, DCs and ILC3s mediated by SAA, IL-1\u03b2, IL-22, ROS, and probably other factors, to amplify and maintain signaling for constitutive accumulation of Th17 cells (Figure S4I)."

                        "To further test the link between bacterial EC adhesion and Th17 induction, we examined Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching/effacing enteropathogen known to induce Th17 cells in mice (Mangan et al., 2006). B6 GF mice were mono-colonized with wild-type or a mutant C. rodentium strain lacking the eae gene, which encodes Intimin, a protein essential for EC adhesion (Kamada et al., 2012). The \u0394eae and wild-type C. rodentium expanded equivalently in the intestinal lumen, as demonstrated by recovery of similar amounts of bacterial DNA from the colon luminal contents of both groups of mice after 5 days of monocolonization (Figure 5A). SEM and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the wild-type strain had a strong tendency to adhere to colonic ECs, whereas the \u0394eae strain did not adhere to ECs and the inner mucus layer of the colon remained intact (Figures 5B and5C). These results were further confirmed by qPCR quantification of mucosa-associated C. rodentium (Figure 5A). Colonization with wild-type C. rodentium resulted in potent induction of Th17 cells in the colon, whereas \u0394eae C. rodentium elicited a far weaker Th17 response (Figure 5D). Colonization with wild-type C. rodentium induced a greater increase in fecal IgA levels than the mutant strain (Figure 5E). Therefore, similarly to commensal SFB, pathogenic C. rodentium induces Th17 and IgA responses, most likely through adhesion to ECs. Of note, during the early phase (5 days after infection), when the epithelial layer was relatively intact, infection with wild-type C. rodentium caused a more conspicuous increase in Th17 cells than IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells. However, in the late phase (14 days after infection), when the epithelial layer was severely disrupted and bacterial invasion had occurred, there was a massive increase in Th1 cells rather than Th17 cells (Figures S5A andS5B), supporting the requirement of intact ECs for Th17 induction in response to C. rodentium, without which the same microbe would elicit a different type of immune response. We also examined IL-22 + ILC3 induction by C. rodentium colonization. The \u0394eae strain induced a robust increase in the frequency of colonic IL-22 + ILC3 cells comparable to the response observed in mice colonized with the wild-type strain (Figure S5C), indicating that immune stimulatory activity is not completely abrogated in the \u0394eae strain, and the induction of IL-22 + ILC3 cells occurs independently of bacterial EC-adhesion.",
                        "Next, we performed gene expression analysis by RNA-seq of colon ECs from mice monocolonized with the \u0394eae or wild-type C. rodentium strain. In comparison to the \u0394eae strain, the wild-type strain specifically induced the expression of genes, such as Duox2, Duoxa2, RegIIIb, RegIIIg, and Nos2, which overlap with genes induced in SI ECs by colonization with EC-adherent SFB (Figures 5F, 5G, S5D, and S5E), although the expression of SAAs in the colon was not significantly enhanced by C. rodentium monocolonization (Figure S5D). Treatment of wild-type C. rodentium-monocolonized mice with NAC in the drinking water significantly limited Th17 cell induction (Figure 5H), without affecting adhesion of C. rodentium to ECs (Figure S5F). Therefore, EC adhesion and subsequent ROS production is a potential mechanism underlying C. rodentium-mediated Th17 cell induction.",
                        "We next examined EHEC O157:H7, another EC-adherent bacterium that can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans and is a global public health concern (Croxen and Finlay, 2010). Because the wild-type O157 strain was lethal in GF mice shortly after the monocolonization (data not shown), we used an O157 strain deficient in both Shiga toxin 1 and 2 genes (\u0394stx1\u0394stx2) (Yokoyama et al., 2001). This double mutant strain expanded in the intestine upon monocolonization without killing the mice and adhered to colonic EC surfaces (Figures 6A and6B). The adhesion was accompanied by induction of colonic Th17 cells (Figure 6C). We subsequently constructed a \u0394stx1\u0394stx2\u0394eae triple mutant strain, which expanded comparably to the \u0394stx1\u0394stx2 double mutant strain in the intestinal lumen but did not adhere to colonic ECs (Figures 6A and6B), and this was accompanied by loss of the ability to induce Th17 cells (Figure 6C).",
                        "Candida albicans is also an EC-adhesive microbe (Figure S6) and was found to increase the frequency of Th17 cells in the colon LP of monocolonized mice (Figure 6D). In contrast, monocolonization of mice with Listeria monocytogenes mainly induced Th1 cells, rather than Th17 cells (Figure 6E). The mice colonized with L. monocytogenes displayed disrupted structure of colon epithelial surface, whereas adhering bacteria were rarely observed (Figure 6F)."

                        "Finally, we attempted to identify members of the human gut microbiota that could exert immunological effects equivalent to those of SFB. To this end, we collected human fecal samples from patients with UC (UC4-2 and UC5-1) and healthy donors (H11, H17, H23) and inoculated them into GF IQI mice. All groups of mice exhibited a significant increase in Th17 cells in the colon (Figure 7A). The Th17 cell induction by H23 microbiota was suppressed by treatment with ampicillin (Amp) or other antibiotics (Figure 7B). In contrast, the UC5-1 microbiota-mediated Th17 cell induction was further enhanced when the mice were given Amp in the drinking water, although reduced by metronidazole (MNZ) or vancomycin (VCM) treatment (Figure 7B). Therefore, different subsets of bacterial species were likely to be responsible for the induction of Th17 cells in mice inoculated with H23 versus UC5-1 samples. Cecal microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were enriched in mice inoculated with UC5-1 sample treated with Amp and correlated with the number of colonic Th17 cells (Figure 7C, marked in red). To isolate Th17-inducing bacterial species, we anaerobically cultured cecal contents from Amp-treated UC5-1 mice using various culture media and picked 192 colonies. BLAST searches of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates contained 20 strains that broadly covered the bacterial species colonizing Amptreated UC5-1 mice (Figure 7C, marked in green). Their genomes were sequenced and a phylogenetic comparison was carried out using 19 ribosomal protein genes predicted from the assembled draft genome of each strain. This analysis revealed that the 20 strains included diverse species, such as Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Bacteroides (Figures 7C andS7A; Table S1).",
                        "To investigate whether the isolated 20 strains have the ability to induce Th17 cells, we introduced a mixture of 20 strains into GF IQI mice. In mice inoculated with the 20 strains, we observed a robust accumulation of Th17 cells in the colon (Figures 7D and7E). The 20strain mix was also effective in Th17 induction in rats (Figure 7F). Similarly to SFB, the 20 strains enhanced expression of Nos2 and Duoxa2 in ECs and IgA and ILC3 responses (Figure 7G), whereas no significant effect was observed for Th1 cells in the colon (Figures 7D and7E). To examine whether these 20 Th17-inducing strains contained EC-adherent bacteria, we performed SEM and FISH. As a control, we examined mice colonized with 17 strains of human-derived Clostridia that have the capacity to induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Atarashi et al., 2013). The 17 Treg-inducing strains of Clostridia were not adhering and disappeared after washing. In contrast, we observed numerous bacteria adhering to the colonic ECs in mice and rats colonized with the 20 Th17-inducing strains (Figures 7H and7I), which is in line with our hypothesis that EC adhesion is an important signal for Th17 cell induction."

            "paragraphs": [
                "In the present study, we demonstrate that SFB, C. rodentium and EHEC O157 promote the induction of intestinal Th17 cells through adhesion to intestinal ECs. Moreover, we isolated 20 bacterial strains from human intestine that can induce Th17 cells in the mouse and rat intestine, and these 20 strains displayed similar EC adhesive characteristics. Therefore, the intestinal immune system mounts Th17 cell responses through recognition of a physical interaction with the microbes, rather than by recognition of released microbial components or soluble metabolites. EC adhesion by microbes was also associated with increases in intestinal IgA + cells. Consistent with our observation, it has been shown that potentially colitogenic bacteria that can invade the inner mucus layer and colonize near the epithelium induce high-affinity IgA responses and become highly coated with IgA (Palm et al., 2014). In contrast to Th17 cells and IgA + cells, IL-22 + ILC3s can be generated by nonadhering commensals. Therefore, Th17 and IgA + cells control EC-adhering microbes, whereas IL-22 + ILC3s may play a more general role in regulation of gut microbiota. The vast majority of gut microbiota are physically separated by the mucus layer (Johansson et al., 2008;Vaishnava et al., 2011), whereas microbes that cross the mucus barrier and attach to the epithelial lining are in many cases pathogenic (SFB and the 20 human strains are exceptional in that they can cross the mucus layer and attach to ECs, but do not penetrate the EC layer). Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that the host immune system has evolved to discriminate the biogeographical distributions of intestinal microbes.",
                "Several reports have demonstrated that adhering SFB induce actin reorganization in SI ECs (Davis and Savage, 1974;Jepson et al., 1993). In this context, morphologically similar cytoplasmic alterations in intestinal ECs have been described in infections with EHEC O157 and C. rodentium (Croxen and Finlay, 2010). It is noteworthy that F-actin inhibition resulted in potentiated C/EBP\u03b4 and SAA1 expression in aMoS7 cells cocultured with M-SFB (Figure S3F). It is interesting to note that SFB have putative ADP-ribosyl transferases that have sequence similarities to the Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, which ribosylates G-actin and thereby inhibits its polymerization (Pamp et al., 2012). Furthermore, because ROS suppresses the activity of certain Rho GTPase family members (Stanley et al., 2014), ROS produced by the Duox2/Duoxa2 system in ECs may, in addition or instead, affect actin reorganization. In any case, there may be a link between actin cytoskeletal modulation by adherent SFB and subsequent gene induction in ECs, possibly through mechanosensing mechanisms (Dupont et al., 2011).",
                "Since recombinant SAA1 activated CD11c + cells to upregulate IL-1\u03b2 expression (Figure 3F), and recombinant IL-1\u03b2 activated ECs to potentiate expression of SAAs (Figure 4G), our results suggest a model in which the initial increase in SAAs in SI ECs caused by SFB adhesion is then augmented via an amplification loop of SAA1 and IL-1\u03b2 between SI ECs and CD11c + myeloid cells (Figure S4I). This amplification processes may be required for the maintenance of high level expression of SAAs in SI ECs and IL-1\u03b2 in myeloid cells, which causes constitutive accumulation of Th17 cells. In an accompanying article published in this issue of Cell, Sano et al. (2015) show that SAAs can directly act on ROR\u03b3t + T cells to induce IL-17 expression. Derebe et al. (2014) showed that SAAs act as a transporter of retinol. Therefore, SAAs may exert their effects through multiple mechanisms. IL-22 derived from ILC3s also contributes to this loop via potentiation of SAA expression by SI ECs. IL-22 alone cannot sufficiently activate this amplification loop, as was shown that IL-22 + ILC3s induced by luminal R-SFB cannot induce Th17 cells (Figure 2D).",
                "A substantial fraction of Th17 cells specifically recognized EC-adhesive M-SFB but not non-adhering R-SFB (Figures 2A and2B). The simplest explanation for this observation is that antigens may be taken up by host cells only when SFB adhere to ECs. This process likely involves bacterial sampling by dendritic cells (DCs). In this context, recognition and phagocytosis of C. rodentium-infected apoptotic ECs by LP DCs were shown to preferentially trigger Th17 cell differentiation (Torchinsky et al., 2009). SFB and other ECadhesive microbes may be engulfed by LP DCs together with their adhering apoptotic ECs, processed and loaded onto MHC class II molecules. SFB are innocuous members of the microbiota; however, SFB can be pathogenic, depending on the host genotype. For example, SFB have been implicated in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as arthritis (Wu et al., 2010). In this context, we observed a striking genotype-specific difference upon monocolonization with EC-adhesive SFB in the induction of Th17 cells, with BALB/c mice having fewer Th17 cells in comparison to B6 and IQI mice. Our observation in BALB/c mice provides one remarkable example showing that the combination of genetic background and composition of the gut microbiota affects T cell status. Genotype-specific differences in the differentiation of T cells in response to a component of the gut microbiota may explain the phenotypic variations in autoimmune disease susceptibility.",
                "Different from the host-specific Th17 induction by SFB, the 20 bacterial strains isolated from a human fecal sample were Th17-inducing in at least two different mammalian hosts (mice and rats, Figures 7E and7F); therefore, they may function in humans and may act as pathobionts, because they were derived from UC patients. However, we did not observe any inflammatory changes in the intestines of mice inoculated with the 20 strains (data not shown). Furthermore, mining of publicly available data from the MetaHIT project (Qin et al., 2010) revealed that only three out of the 20 strains were significantly increased in the microbiomes of UC and Crohn's disease subjects (Figure S7B). Moreover, the 20 strains were not abundant in mice inoculated with a fecal sample from subject UC4-2, in which Th17 cells were induced similarly to UC5-1 microbiota-associated mice (Figure S7C). Therefore, the 20 strains may not be essential components for Th17 induction nor contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD in humans. Our study design has some limitations in this context, including the limited number of subjects tested and the fact that robust activity in mice may not be physiologically relevant in humans and vice versa. Nevertheless, this is a clear demonstration of Th17 cell induction by human-associated bacterial species and therefore represents a significant step forward in dissecting human intestinal microbiota biology. The intestinal Th17 responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria with shared EC-adhering characteristics have obvious clinical implications in the context of IBD, vaccine design, and probiotics."
