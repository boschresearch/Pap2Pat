    "date": "2020-05-01",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis resulting from tumor resistance to anticancer therapy and a high recurrence rate. Compelling evidence suggests that this is driven by subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with tumor-initiating potential. ABC subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5) has been identified as a molecular marker for distinct subsets of chemoresistant tumor-initiating cell populations in diverse human malignancies. In the current study, we examined the potential role of ABCB5 in growth and chemoresistance of GBM. We found that ABCB5 is expressed in primary GBM tumors, in which its expression was significantly correlated with the CSC marker protein CD133 and with overall poor survival. Moreover, ABCB5 was also expressed by CD133-positive CSCs in the established human U-87 MG, LN-18, and LN-229 GBM cell lines. Antibody- or shRNA-mediated functional ABCB5 blockade inhibited proliferation and survival of GBM cells and sensitized them to temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis in vitro. Likewise, in in vivo human GBM xenograft experiments with immunodeficient mice, mAb treatment inhibited growth of mutant TP53, WT PTEN LN-229 tumors, and sensitized LN-229 tumors to TMZ therapy. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ABCB5 blockade inhibits TMZ-induced G2/M arrest and augments TMZ-mediated cell death. Our results identify ABCB5 as a GBM chemoresistance marker and point to the potential utility of targeting ABCB5 to improve current GBM therapies.",

We found that ABCB5 is expressed in primary GBM tumors, in which its expression was significantly correlated with the CSC marker protein CD133 and with overall poor survival. Moreover, ABCB5 was also expressed by CD133 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 3 , the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, is associated with poor prognosis and high lethality (1). Patient survival remains dismal owing to therapeutic resistance to clinically approved drugs, such as temozolomide (TMZ) and bevacizumab, and a high rate of tumor recurrence (2)(3)(4)(5). Due to the minimal beneficial effects of existing treatment regimens, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting therapy-resistant cancer subpopulations, which may correspond to GBM cancer stem cells (CSCs) (2,5).",
                "Studies in human brain cancer models have identified a central role of CSCs in brain tumor initiation, progression, and chemoresistance (3,5,6). CD133/PROM1 has been shown by several research groups to enrich for tumor-initiating GBM subpopulations (2,4,5). CD133-positive GBM CSCs possess increased tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, and self-renewal capacity in human-to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments and have been shown to correlate with poor clinical outcomes (2,4,5,7). This suggests that specific eradication of the therapyrefractory CD133-positive CSC reservoirs might help to overcome GBM therapeutic resistance.",
                "TMZ is a clinically approved drug for the treatment of GBM, which leads to significant prolongation of patient survival (8). Although acting as a cytotoxic imidazotetrazine, TMZ can induce a G 2 /M arrest (9,10), which allows therapyresistant cancer cells to repair the DNA before entering into the mitotic or M phase, hence protecting the cells and their progeny from drug-induced cytotoxicity (11)(12)(13). An essential step for G 2 /M transition is activation of the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex. In resting cells, the tyrosine kinases WEE1 and MYT1 induce inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1, thus maintaining the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex in an inactive state. As the cells prepare to divide, polo-like kinase (PLK1), a major positive regulator of G 2 /M transition (14), is activated. Subsequently, PLK1 induces expression of CDK1 by inhibiting WEE1 and MYT1. PLK1 also activates CDC25C, which in turn plays a pivotal role in dephosphorylation and activation of CDK1. Chemotherapeutic drugs and other DNA-damaging agents can severely impair this pathway by activating the sensory ATM/ATR kinases, which phosphorylate and activate CHEK1. CHEK1 phosphorylates and inactivates CDC25C, hence retaining the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex in an inactive phosphorylated state and eventually causing G 2 /M arrest. Thus, new approaches to cancer therapeutics aim to use conventional drugs in combination with agents that are capable of abrogating G 2 /M arrest (15)(16)(17).",
                "Our laboratory has shown that ABC family member B5 (ABCB5) is preferentially expressed by tumor-initiating and therapy-resistant CSC subpopulations in diverse human malignancies, where it is also co-expressed with CD133 (18 -22). Recently, ABCB5 was found to be highly up-regulated in the ALDH bright CSC subpopulation in the human U-87 MG GBM cell line (23). Moreover, ABCB5 has been established as a key mediator of tumor growth, aggressiveness, and multidrug resistance in malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular, oral squamous and Merkel cell carcinomas, and ocular surface squamous neoplasia (18,21,(24)(25)(26)(27)(28). Here, we hypothesized that, similar to its role in other cancers, ABCB5 might contribute to malignant growth and therapy resistance of GBM.",
                "Our study results establish ABCB5 expression in GBM and show that ABCB5 targeting can inhibit tumor growth in human-to-mouse xenotransplantation models and sensitize xenograft tumors to TMZ treatment. Mechanistically, we show that ABCB5 inhibition results in modulation of G 2 /M checkpoint regulators and subsequent reversal of TMZ-induced G 2 /M arrest, leading to sensitization of GBM to this currently approved therapy."

                                "We first examined ABCB5 copy number alteration and expression in GBM and lower-grade glioma (LGG) sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (29). An enhanced increase in copy number gains was seen in GBM (77.4%) compared with oligodendroglioma (19.6%), oligoastrocytoma (22.5%), and astrocytoma (25.3%) (Fig. 1A). There was a statis-tically significant difference between means of ABCB5 mRNA expression in various brain cancers (H \u03ed 138.1, p \u03fd 0.0001). ABCB5 mRNA expression was significantly higher in GBM (0.51 \u03ee 0.11 log 2 (counts), mean \u03ee S.E.) compared with oligodendroglioma (-0.66 \u03ee 0.05 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001), oligoastrocytoma (-0.62 \u03ee 0.06 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001), and astrocytoma (-0.64 \u03ee 0.06 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). There was no statistically significant difference in ABCB5 mRNA expression between oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma (p \u03fe 0.99), oligoastrocytoma and astrocytoma (p \u03fe 0.99), or oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma (p \u03fe 0.99). ABCB5 was detected in the GBM TCGA mRNA expression data set in all three GBM subtypes (classical: 0.16 \u03ee 0.15 log 2 (counts), mesenchymal: 0.90 \u03ee 0.20 log 2 (counts), proneural: 0.48 \u03ee 0.18 log 2 (counts), mean \u03ee S.E.) (Fig. 1C, left). We also examined the correlation of ABCB5 mRNA expression with overall survival (OS) for all GBM subtypes (Fig. 1C, right). There was a significant trend for median OS to be lower (12.6 versus 14.9 months) for high compared with low ABCB5 expression (optimal cutoff high/low \u03ed log 2 (0.06), p \u03ed 0.053) when all GBM subtypes were considered together. For the mesenchymal subtype, median survival was significantly lower (10.4 versus 15.9 months) for high versus low ABCB5 expression (optimal cutoff \u03ed log 2 (0.92), p \u03ed 0.031). For the classical and the proneural subtypes, median survival was nominally lower, with 14.0 versus 14.9 months (high versus low ABCB5 expression, optimal cutoff \u03ed log 2 (1.55), p \u03ed 0.953) and 12.5 versus 14.9 months (high versus low ABCB5 expression, optimal cutoff \u03ed log 2 (0.03), p \u03ed 0.453), respectively. These results further underscore the clinical significance of ABCB5 expression in GBM, most notably for the mesenchymal subtype. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed ABCB5 expression in patient-derived primary GBM tumor biopsy material at the protein level (Fig. 1D).",
                                "It has been recognized that GBM exhibits substantial intertumor heterogeneity and can be distinguished as primary GBM (i.e. presenting as fully developed high-grade gliomas without evidence of a precursor lesion) or secondary GBM, which evolves from less malignant astrocytomas (30). Furthermore, recent TCGA analyses identified the existence of distinct GBM molecular subtypes based on their genomic alterations and characteristic molecular signatures (31). Among them, a proneural subtype with mutations in IDH and TP53 corresponds to secondary GBM and is associated with a better outcome (32). A mesenchymal subtype that carries homozygous PTEN loss corresponds to primary GBM and is associated with a worse outcome (32,33). Here, we examined ABCB5 expression and function in GBM cell lines representative of such molecular subtypes (i.e. the LN-229 and LN-18 cell lines that carry mutations in TP53 and are PTEN WT and the U-87 MG cell line that is characterized by PTEN loss and WT TP53) (34). We found ABCB5 to be expressed in all three human GBM cell lines (LN-229, LN-18, and U-87 MG) by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1E), nested RT-PCR (Fig. 1F), and flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1G), which showed cell surface expression of ABCB5 on 40.6% (40.6 \u03ee 0.8%, mean \u03ee S.E.) of LN-229, 31.8% (31.8 \u03ee 2.1%, mean \u03ee S.E.) of LN-18, and 16.5% (16.5 \u03ee 0.9%, mean \u03ee S.E.) of U-87 MG GBM cells."

                "Based on our finding of ABCB5 expression on a subpopulation of GBM cells (Fig. 1G), we hypothesized that ABCB5 might confer therapeutic resistance on GBM CSCs, which are marked by CD133 (2). This hypothesis was supported by previous findings in melanoma and colorectal cancer, where ABCB5 has been shown to be co-expressed with CD133 on therapy-resistant subpopulations of tumor cells (18 -22). To test this further, we first examined CD133 mRNA expression in GBM and LGG RNA-Seq data from TCGA (29). Similar to ABCB5, there was a statistically significant difference in CD133 mRNA expression between means (H \u03ed 71.46, p \u03fd 0.0001). CD133 mRNA expression was significantly higher in GBM (8.39 \u03ee 0.14 log 2 (counts), mean \u03ee S.E.) compared with oligodendroglioma (7.21 \u03ee 0.08 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001), oligoastrocytoma (7.34 \u03ee 0.08 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001), and astrocytoma (7.64 \u03ee 0.09 log 2 (counts), p \u03fd 0.0001) (Fig. 2A).

Additionally, a statistically significant difference was observed between oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma (p \u03ed 0.004). CD133 expression positively correlated with ABCB5 in GBM and LGG TCGA RNA-Seq data (r s (667) \u03ed 0.26, p \u03fd 0.0001). Moreover, dual-color flow cytometry confirmed co-expression of ABCB5 and CD133 on 2.2% of LN-229, 6.4% of LN-18, and 3.4% of U-87 MG human GBM cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, 100% of CD133-positive LN-229 and U-87 MG cells and 93% of CD133-positive LN-18 cells expressed ABCB5. Considering the evidence for the tumorigenic potential of CD133-positive GBM stem cells (2), expression of ABCB5 on CD133-positive CSCs indicates the possibility of targeting GBM growth by functionally inhibiting ABCB5.",
                "Alongside our recent discovery of a novel anti-apoptotic function of ABCB5 in normal stem cells (35) and human colorectal cancer (18), we hypothesized that ABCB5 might also be required for GBM stem cell maintenance and tumor aggressiveness. When LN-229, LN-18, and U-87 MG cells were incubated with 100 g/ml anti-ABCB5 mAb (3C2-1D12) (36) or isotype-matched control mAb for 72 h and expression of CD133 (APC, FL4 fluorescence) was determined by flow cytometry, we found that in vitro treatment of the GBM cell lines LN-229 and LN-18 with anti-ABCB5 mAb reduced the frequency of CD133-positive CSC subpopulations by more than 2-fold compared with treatment with isotype control (ABCB5 mAb versus isotype control: 0.35 \u03ee 0.03% versus 0.83 \u03ee 0.03%, p \u03fd 0.0001, mean \u03ee S.E.) (Fig. 2C), whereas no significant difference in CD133-positive cell frequency was observed in U-87 MG cells after treatment with anti-ABCB5 mAb (ABCB5 mAb versus isotype control: 1.24 \u03ee 0.02% versus 1.02 \u03ee 0.13%, p \u03ed 0.1664, mean \u03ee S.E.). These differential responses might be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of the GBM cell lines under study. For example, the LN-229 and LN-18 cell lines have increased mutation burden in DNA repair genes, such as TP53 and WT PTEN mutant, compared with U-87 MG, which is a TP53 WT and PTEN mutant. Moreover, these results suggest that, in U-87 MG, CD133-positive GBM stem cells might utilize additional ABCB5-independent pathways for their survival and could show attenuated responses to ABCB5 blockade in vivo."

We incubated LN-229, LN-18, and U-87 MG cells with 0 -200 g/ml ABCB5 mAb or isotype control mAb for 72 h and analyzed cell proliferation by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. There was a statistically significant difference between ABCB5 mAb-treated and isotype control mAb-treated cells as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), (F(1, 144) \u03ed 48.42, p \u03fd 0.0001).

We found that antibody-mediated functional inhibition of ABCB5 is capable of abrogating TMZ-induced G 2 /M arrest in GBM cell cultures, as evidenced by the 1.4-fold reduced cell accumulation in G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle following ABCB5 mAb and TMZ treatment, compared with cells that received TMZ treatment in the presence of isotype control (ABCB5 mAb versus isotype control: 18.9 \u03ee 2.5% versus 25.76 \u03ee 4.6%, p \u03ed 0.0225, mean \u03ee S.E.) (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis revealed that ABCB5 blockade reversed TMZ-mediated G 2 /M arrest by inhibiting cell-cycle arrest-inducing checkpoint molecules (ATM, CHK1, WEE1, and MYT1), and augmenting the activation of molecules that drive cells from G 2 phase to mitosis by either inducing their phosphorylation (as for PLK1) or by removing their inhibitory phosphorylation (as for CDC25C and CDC2) (Fig. 6C). In support of these in vitro findings, similar changes in cell cycle protein expression were observed in tumor xenografts from mice treated with TMZ in the presence of either ABCB5 mAb or isotype control mAb (Fig. 6D).

                        "In the current study, based on previously established functions in diverse malignancies (18,21,(24)(25)(26)(27)(28), we examined the potential of ABCB5 as a novel therapeutic target in GBM. Our results revealed ABCB5 expression in primary human GBM tumors and three established GBM cell lines. Using mAb-based ABCB5 inhibition strategies in vitro or ABCB5 blockade in tumor xenotransplantation models in vivo, we show for the first time that targeting ABCB5 can significantly inhibit tumor growth and sensitize a TP53 mutant PTEN WT GBM subtype to TMZ treatment. We demonstrate that ABCB5 inhibition results in modulation of the G 2 /M checkpoint regulators and subsequent reversal of TMZ-induced G 2 /M arrest.",
                        "The finding of specific ABCB5 overexpression in human GBM compared with less aggressive brain tumors and the significant correlation of ABCB5 expression with OS among GBM patients points to a potential role of ABCB5 as a determinant of GBM aggression and therapeutic resistance. This is further supported by the observed expression of ABCB5 on CD133positive GBM CSCs and a significant positive correlation between CD133 and ABCB5 expression in clinical GBM specimens. CD133-positive GBM subpopulations are enriched for CSCs and exhibit higher rates of self-renewal, proliferation, and tumorigenicity compared with CD133-negative populations (2,37,41). Moreover, enrichment of CD133-positive CSCs is observed in GBM cultures, xenografts, and clinical tumor specimens following radiation and chemotherapy (3,6,42), highlighting their role in GBM progression and therapy resistance. Our data indicate that, similar to its function in normal tissue stem cells (35), ABCB5 contributes significantly to the survival of GBM CSCs, because antibody-mediated ABCB5 blockade leads to a significant decline in the CD133-positive CSC subpopulation in human GBM cell lines. Our finding that ABCB5 blockade can attenuate proliferation and promote apoptosis underscores the potential role of ABCB5 targeting in the reversal of CSC-mediated GBM tumorigenesis.",
                        "Whereas TMZ remains one of the main therapeutic agents in GBM, less than 50% of patients respond to TMZ therapy (43). Here we identified ABCB5 as a potential mechanism of GBM resistance to TMZ. It has been well-established that in GBM, TMZ can induce G 2 /M arrest through activation of ATM/ ATR-Chk1/2 (9, 10), which is a prosurvival mechanism that enables cancer cells to repair their DNA prior to mitosis entry. Inhibition of the cell-cycle arrest may result in mitotic catastrophe and cell death (16). Our finding of specific enrichment of cell-cycle regulation-related gene categories, such as Cell Cycle: Aneuploidy (3.22), Cell Cycle: Spindle Checkpoint (2.36), and Cell Cycle: G 2 /M Transition (2.28), in ABCB5-positive GBM cells (Fig. 5B) suggests that ABCB5 blockade might potentiate growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of TMZ through revocation of G 2 /M cell cycle arrest.",
                        "We found that treatment with TMZ triggered G 2 /M arrest in GBM cells by inducing phosphorylation and activation of ATM and CHEK1, inhibitory Ser-216 phosphorylation of CDC25C, retention of inhibitory Tyr-15 phosphorylation of CDK1, acti-vation of the inhibitory kinases WEE1 and MYT1, and finally, accumulation of cyclin B1, whereas ABCB5 blockade inhibited this arrest-inducing signaling. Treatment of GBM cells with TMZ in the presence of ABCB5 mAb removed the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC25C and CDK1, thereby activating CDC25C and the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex. This activation of CDC25C and CDK1 triggered by ABCB5 mAb-mediated inhibition of ATM and CHEK1 and by activation of PLK1 that inhibits the inhibitory kinases WEE1 and MYT1 represents a major positive regulator of G 2 /M transition (14). Abrogation of the G 2 /M checkpoint through inactivation of ATM and CHEK1 has been shown to sensitize GBM and other cancer cells to drug cytotoxicity (16,44). As a corollary to these reports, our data indicate that attenuation of TMZ-induced G 2 /M arrest by ABCB5 blockade sensitized GBM cells to drug-mediated death, as was evident from increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of GBM cells upon combined treatment with TMZ and ABCB5 mAb. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in addition to cell-cycle regulation, ABCB5 might also function as a GBM efflux transporter, a function previously attributed to other ABC family members, such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 (45)(46)(47). Further studies would be required to investigate this possibility.",
                        "Furthermore, several recent studies demonstrated that there is significant intertumor heterogeneity in human GBM and identified GBM molecular subtypes associated with diverse patient outcomes (31)(32)(33). Proneuronal or secondary GBM is characterized by mutations in IDH and TP53 with WT PTEN status. It has features of neuronal differentiation and is associated with better outcomes (32). Primary GBM possesses a mesenchymal molecular subtype with EGFR amplification and PTEN loss. It presents at an older age and has worse outcomes (32). Here we found that, whereas ABCB5 blockade exhibited significant anti-tumor activity in all cell lines in vitro, the in vivo inhibitory effect on tumor growth was more pronounced in TP53-mutant PTEN-WT LN-229 cells compared with TP53-WT PTEN-mutant U-87 MG cells. Several factors might be contributing to this differential in vivo response. Our recent discoveries that ABCB5 serves as a critical mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling with growth-inducing and anti-apoptotic functions in normal tissues and cancer (35,48) suggest that constitutive activation of this pathway in the setting of PTEN loss in U-87 MG cells can override the effect of ABCB5 blockade. This mechanism might be responsible for the limited impact of ABCB5 blockade on CD133-positive GBM CSC frequency in U-87 MG cells compared with LN-229 and LN-18 cells. As in vivo tumor growth is primarily driven by CSC, lack of an inhibitory effect on CSC frequency might also be responsible for the limited in vivo effect of ABCB5 inhibition in U-87 MG tumors. Last, the significantly larger tumor sizes in more rapidly growing U-87 MG xenografts could have adversely affected ABCB5 mAb tumor penetration and thus attenuated the effect of ABCB5 blockade on tumor growth. More extensive preclinical studies are needed to further refine ABCB5 targeting strategies for optimal clinical translation.",
