Entailment inferences are computed between semantic representations of text objects which, for a set of features, indicate whether the feature is known or unknown about the text object.

                        "Vector-space representations of semantics are now very popular, because distributional models of semantics allow these representations to effectively capture many forms of semantic similarity, and can be trained on large amounts of unannotated text. However, similarity is of only limited use; in many tasks what we really want is semantic entailment, which is a more powerful asymmetric relation. For example, to produce abstract summaries, we need to ensure that the text entails the summary. Previous work on modeling entailment using vector spaces has generally relied on the same vector operator as similarity, namely the dot product, which is a symmetric operator, and thus these methods have relied on scores computed outside of the vector space to break the symmetry, or supervised learning of the operator itself.",
                        "Distributional semantics uses the distributions of words in contexts to induce vector-space embeddings of words that encode their semantic similarity. Two words are predicted to be similar if the dot product between their vectors is high. Two popular examples of such models are the Conditional Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram models of the Word2Vec software (Mikolov, T., et al., \u201cEfficient estimation of word representations in vector space,\u201d ArXiv:1301.3781, pp. 1-12 (2013), \u201cMikolov 2013a\u201d; Mikolov, T., et al., \u201cDistributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality,\u201d NIPS, 26, pp. 3111-3119 (2013), \u201cMikolov 2013b\u201d). These simple neural network models are very fast, and can be applied to very large corpora of unannotated text. Their induced word embeddings have been shown to be useful for a wide variety of tasks.",
                        "Entailment is a more powerful semantic relation than similarity. Similarity can be considered a soft symmetric version of entailment. But distributional semantic models have had difficulty modeling lexical entailment, in part because they are based on the dot product, which is symmetric. The most successful previous work on unsupervised or semi-supervised models of lexical entailment tasks, such as hypernym detection, have either developed several asymmetric measures or used a combination of the similarity score from distributional semantic vectors with these measures.

                        "Logical entailment describes a relation between two text objects, such as words, phrases, or sentences. If the first text object entails the second then this means that if the first is true then the second must also be true.",
                        "Distributional semantics can be used to create vector-space representations that capture many forms of semantic similarity, but their relation to semantic entailment has been less clear. A vector-space model which provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment is described. Using a mean-field approximation, approximate inference procedures and entailment operators over vectors of probabilities of features being known (versus unknown) are described. This framework can be used to reinterpret an existing distributional-semantic model (Word2Vec) as approximating an entailment-based model of the distributions of words in contexts, thereby predicting lexical entailment relations. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy detection, substantial improvements over previous results are obtained.",
                        "Unlike previous vector-space models of entailment, the exemplary framework explicitly models what information is unknown. This is a useful property, because entailment reflects what information is and is not known; a representation y entails a representation x if and only if everything that is known given x is also known for y. Thus, entailment can be modeled in a vector space where each dimension represents something that may be known. As illustrated in Table 1, knowing that a feature f is true always entails knowing that same feature, but never entails knowing that a different feature g is true. Also, knowing that a feature is true always entails not knowing anything (unk), since strictly less information is still entailment, but the reverse is never true. Table 1 also illustrates that knowing that a feature f is false () patterns exactly the same way as knowing that an unrelated feature g is true. This illustrates that the relevant dichotomy for entailment is known versus unknown, and not true versus false.",
                        "To develop a vector-space model of whether features are known or unknown, discrete binary vectors, where 1 means known and 0 means unknown, can be generated. Entailment between these discrete binary vectors can be computed by independently checking each dimension. However to do calculations with distributions over these vectors, it is useful to consider the case where the features are not independent. For example, if feature f has a 50% chance of being true and a 50% chance of being false, the assumption that there is a 25% chance that both f and  are known may well be incorrect. This simple case of mutual exclusion is just one example of a wide range of constraints between features which the method can incorporate into a semantic model. These constraints mean that the different dimensions of the vector space are not independent, and therefore exact models are not factorized. Because the models are not factorized, exact calculations of entailment and exact inference of vectors are intractable.",
                        "Mean-field approximations are a popular approach to efficient inference for intractable models. In a mean-field approximation, distributions over binary vectors are represented using a single probability for each dimension. These vectors of real values are the basis of the exemplary vector space model for entailment.",
                        "The exemplary vector-space model provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment. This framework is derived from a mean-field approximation to entailment between binary vectors, and includes operators for measuring entailment between vectors, and procedures for inferring vectors in an entailment graph. The framework is validated by using it to reinterpret existing Word2Vec word embedding vectors as approximating an entailment-based model of the distribution of words in contexts. This reinterpretation allows the use of existing word embeddings as an unsupervised model of lexical entailment, successfully predicting hyponymy relations using the proposed entailment operators in both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments.",
                        "It is therefore assumed that text objects (e.g. words, phrases, sentences), can be each represented by a multidimensional feature vector in a vector space, which is a semantic representation of the text object. Each feature of the vector corresponds to an proposition being known/unknown for an object, which may be a binary value {1,0}, when the proposition is known to be true/unknown, or a continuous probability between 0 and 1, which represents a prediction that the proposition is known. For example, given a simple set of features such as (is a physical object, is a digital object, is a color, is a lethal weapon, is a toy), the word gun could be represented by a binary vector (1,0,0,1,0) and the word toy could be represented by a binary vector (1,0,0,0,1). Given the text object toy gun, its semantic representation should indicate that it is entailed by toy rather than gun, since toy gun is a hyponym of toy. Then, the sentence John played with a toy will be more likely to be predicted to entail John played with a toy gun.",

Such models and their induced word embeddings 44 have applications in the wide variety of tasks that benefit from robust entailment prediction. For example, producing abstract summaries of text requires that the summary is entailed by the text. Such summaries are useful for large-scale opinion summarization, for example where the aim is to label a cluster of opinions with an abstract statement which all the opinions imply. This potential is illustrated with a clustering algorithm for words that labels clusters with abstract words, i.e., with semantic representations that do not directly correspond to real words.

As an example, if one feature is for the proposition is hot and another is for the proposition is cold, then the optimal predicted vector should not include high probabilities of being true for both these features.

In contrast, other features may be highly correlated, so in this case, the element in the matrix corresponding to features i and j will be set to a higher (e.g., positive) value.

Then, the constraints which are violated by this vector are identified by comparing the output vector Y with the matrix of constraints and identifying those features for which the constraints are the most violated. Then \u03b8y is computed/modified to attempt to reduce the extent of the constraint violations, e.g., by lowering the weight for one of a pair of negatively correlated features relative to that of the other feature in the pair and/or by adjusting the weights of a pair of positively correlated features. X is then recomputed using the new \u03b8y. The constraints violated are reevaluated and, if appropriate, \u03b8y is modified and Y recomputed.

It can be assumed that the semantic features of a word are (statistically speaking) redundant with respect to those of its context words, and consistent with those of its context words. For example, the meaning of toy in the phrase plastic toy gun may be assumed to have semantic features similar to those of its left and/or right contexts plastic and gun. In this example, only one context is considered, but the word toy is expected to be found in other contexts in a collection of texts (which may be unlabeled), as in plastic toy weapon, wicked toy guns, and so forth, depending on the type of texts in the collection.",

This can be split into two steps, first, inference of the hidden vector from the middle vector, context vectors and prior constraints on the hidden vector, and second, computing the log-probability that this hidden vector entails both the middle vector and the context vectors.

The composed latent vector could then form the input to another composition, producing a hierarchical compositional structure useful for understanding phrases and sentences.

With textual entailment it becomes possible to summarize with more abstract statements than those which actually occur in the text. A summary simply needs to be entailed by the text, with the relevance of different information being a separate issue. Answering questions about a document is a similar problem, but relevance is determined by the question. Given a question, the aim is to find the relevant information in the document (or collection of documents), such that the information is entailed by the document(s).",

Given the present model of entailment and the model of clustering presented above, clusters labeled by a vector that is entailed by the vectors for all the elements in the cluster are obtained. The label vector then forms an abstract representation of the cluster. If the elements are text and the labels are themselves associated with text, then the text label represents an abstract summary of every text in the cluster. Applying this technique to the clustering of opinions gives us a powerful new form of opinion summarization. Such abstract summaries are invaluable in opinion summarization because they are able to summarize a large numbers of opinions, none of which say exactly the same thing, but many of which agree on some points.",

These methods allow the definition of more powerful models based on distributional semantic vectors than are possible with the semantic similarity measured by the dot product. For example, the clustering algorithm finds center vectors which are an abstraction of all the vectors in the cluster, rather than a centroid, and thus is appropriate for producing abstract summaries of collections of documents.",

These experiments use data on hyponymy, which is the canonical type of lexical entailment. Initial results on the unsupervised induction of new distributional semantic vector spaces which are designed to work well with the operators are described.

The performance of the operators is comparable to that obtained by training a hyponymy classifier in the semi-supervised setting. The operators achieve exceptional results on unsupervised hypernym detection. A clustering method based on these operators, applied to words, is described. Initial results on distributional semantics models (analogous to Word2Vec) are also presented.

Their selection is balanced between positive and negative examples, so that accuracy can be used as the performance measure. All pairs are noun-noun pairs. For their semi-supervised experiments, ten-fold cross validation is used, where for each testing set, items are removed from the associated training set if they contain any word from the testing set.

This threshold is highly dependent on the proportion of positive and negative examples in the dataset, which is a completely artificial proportion and thus not predictable with unsupervised methods. For this reason, each operator's score was threshold at the point where the proportion of positive examples output is 50%, since the gold annotations have the same number of positive and negative examples, which we call \u201c50% accuracy\u201d.

For the semi-supervised case, training a linear vector-space mapping into a new vector space is compared, in which the operators are applied.

However, because the dot product is a symmetric operator, it always performs at chance for direction classification.

This is used (with vector sum) to perform semantic transforms, such as the sum \u201cking\u2212male+female=queen\u201d, and has previously been used for modeling hyponymy (Vylomova 2015, Weeds 2014).

Adding some supervision helps distinguish features that capture semantic properties from other features which are not relevant to hypernym detection. But even with supervision, the aim of the present method is for the resulting model to be captured in a vector space, and not in a parametrized scoring function. Thus, mappings are trained from the Word2Vec word vectors to new word vectors, and then the entailment operators applied in this new vector space to predict hyponymy. Because the words in the testing set are always disjoint from the words in the training set, this experiment measures how well the original unsupervised vector space captures features that generalize entailment across words, and not how well the mapping can learn about individual words. For this reason, this is referred to as a semi-supervised setting, rather than a supervised setting.",

The mapped  model has the highest accuracy, followed by the probabilistic entailment operator  and Weeds 2014, which have similar accuracies. Direction accuracy of mapped  reaches 91%, much better than with vector differences dif and similarly to probabilistic entailment.

For the semi-supervised experiments, the results are very different from the unsupervised results.

These gradients were plotted for the range of values typically found in Word2Vec vectors for both the middle vector and the context vector. FIG. 3 shows three of these plots. As expected, the second interpretation is more accurate than the first because its plot is anti-symmetric around the diagonal, like the Word2Vec gradient. In the third alternative, the constant 1 was chosen to optimise this match, producing a close match to the Word2Vec training gradient, as shown in FIG. 3 (Word2Vec versus Unk dup).",

The distributional semantic model provides a mapping from words to vectors, which can then be used to predict lexical entailment between two words using the operators. The unsupervised model has been evaluated on hyponymy classification, and on classifying the direction of a given hyponymy pair. These experiments indicate that these operators do reflect information discovered by distributional semantics about both the similarity and relative abstractness necessary to detect hyponymy, showing better performance than both dot product and vector differences. To further demonstrate usefulness, the operators are evaluated in a semi-supervised setting, where mappings from the unsupervised vector space to a new vector space are learnt in which the entailment operator makes more accurate hyponymy predictions. These experiments show that the entailment operators are powerful enough to capture hyponymy in a trained vector space, and simple enough that the mapping from the unsupervised vectors generalizes to words which were not in the training set.",
