                        "Leishmania major is one of several Leishmania parasites that, when introduced into a host organism, is the causative agent of leishmaniasis. Leishmania major is a species of the Leishmania tropica complex. Other complexes (comprising species and subspecies) include Leishmania donovani, Leishmania mexicana, and Leishmania viannia. According to the World Health Organization, leishmaniasis is among the most infectious diseases worldwide and is endemic in 88 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and in North and South America. It has been estimated that over 12 million people suffer from Leishmanial infections worldwide, where serious public health problems exist particularly in countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, India, Peru, and Syria. Leishmaniasis most commonly manifests itself as either cutaneous (i.e. skin) leishmaniasis (CL) or visceral (i.e. internal organs) leishmaniasis (VL). CL is the most common form of leishmaniasis and is the result of transmission of the parasite Leishmania major via the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly. Symptoms of CL include large skin legions or ulcers on exposed parts of the body, which cause serious disability and permanent scarring.",
                        "Methods of treating leishmaniasis have typically been limited to administering pentavalent antimony (SbV) (Sundar et al. (2002) Curr. Opin. Infec. Dis. 15, 593-598). Due to the recent emergence of large-scale resistance to SbV, however, the effectiveness of this treatment is becoming increasingly limited. Furthermore, SbV treatment has several side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. In addition, HIV co-infection with Leishmania species presents further challenges since such co-infection can dramatically alter the epidemiology, diagnosis, and response of leishmaniasis to therapy (Lee et al. (2003) Int. J. Infect. Dis. 7, 86-93)."

The antibody can be \u201cpolyclonal\u201d, \u201cmonoclonal\u201d, \u201cchimeric\u201d, \u201chumanized\u201d, or human.",
                        "The term \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d refers to that fragment of a molecule (i.e., an epitope) that induces an antibody and which thereafter makes contact with a particular antibody. When a protein or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal, numerous regions of the protein may induce the production of antibodies which bind specifically to a given region or three-dimensional structure on the protein; these regions or structures are referred to as antigenic determinants. An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen (i.e., the immunogen used to elicit the immune response) for binding to an antibody.",
                        "The term \u201cantisense\u201d refers to any composition containing nucleotide sequences which are complementary to a specific DNA or RNA sequence.",

Antisense molecules include nucleic acids (that can include modified nucleotide base and modified sugar moieties) and may be produced by any method including synthesis or transcription. Once introduced into a cell, the complementary nucleotides combine with natural sequences produced by the cell to form duplexes and block either transcription or translation of the sequences.",
                        "The term \u201cbiological sample\u201d is used in its broadest sense. A biological sample is suspected of containing LmPDE nucleic acid molecules, or fragments thereof, or a LmPDE polypeptide. The suitable biological sample can be from an animal or a human. The sample can be a cell sample or a tissue sample, including samples from spleen, lymph node, thymus, bone marrow, liver, heart, testis, brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. The sample can be a biological fluid, including urine, blood sera, blood plasma, phlegm, or lavage fluid. Alternatively, the sample can be a swab from the nose, ear, or throat.",
                        "The term \u201cbiologically active\u201d refers to a polypeptide having structural, regulatory, or biochemical functions of a naturally occurring molecule. Likewise, \u201cimmunologically active\u201d refers to the capability of the natural, recombinant, or synthetic LmPDEs of the invention, or any fragment thereof, to induce a specific immune response in appropriate animals or cells and to bind with specific antibodies. For example, the polypeptides of the invention can elicit antibodies that specifically bind an epitope associated with a LmPDE polypeptide of the invention. Accordingly, a LmPDE polypeptide is capable of inducing a specific immune response in appropriate animals or cells, and/or binding with ligands such as specific antibodies.",
                        "The term \u201ccatalytic domain\u201d refers to a conserved subset of amino acids within a PDE sequence that is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis reaction of the bound substrate.",
                        "The term \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d refers to an antibody in which the variable regions derived from one species are combined with the constant regions of an antibody derived from a different species. Chimeric antibodies are useful, as they are less likely to be antigenic to a human subject than antibodies with non-human constant regions and variable regions. The antigen combining region (variable region) of a chimeric antibody can be derived from a non-human source (e.g. murine) and the constant region of the chimeric antibody, which confers biological effector function to the immunoglobulin, can be derived from a human source (Morrison et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6851; Takeda et al. (1985) Nature 314, 452; Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Boss et al;, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397). The chimeric antibody may have the antigen binding specificity of the nonhuman antibody molecule and the effector function conferred by the human antibody molecule.",
                        "The term \u201ccomplementary\u201d refers to nucleic acid molecules having purine and pyrimidine nucleotides which have the capacity to associate through hydrogen bonding to form double stranded nucleic acid molecules. The following base pairs are related by complementarity: guanine and cytosine; adenine and thymine; and adenine and uracil. The term \u201ccomplementary\u201d applies to all base pairs comprising two single-stranded nucleic acid molecules, or to all base pairs comprising a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule folded upon itself. Complementarity between two single-stranded molecules may be partial, in which only some of the nucleic acids bind, or it may be complete when total complementarity exists between the single stranded molecules. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands.",
                        "The term \u201ccontrol cell\u201d is a cell that is generally the same, e.g., genotypically and phenotypically, as the cell to which it is being compared (e.g., the cells can be sister cells), but which is not exposed to a test compound.",
                        "The term \u201cexpression control sequence\u201d or \u201cexpression control element\u201d refers to a regulatory polynucleotide sequence that can direct the transcription and translation of an open reading frame. Expression control elements are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, inducible promoters, constitutive promoters, splice donor and acceptor sites, secretion signals, enhancers, transcription terminators, and other transcriptional regulatory elements. Other expression control elements that are involved in translation are known in the art, and include the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and initiation and termination codons.",
                        "The term \u201cfragment\u201d of a LmPDE polypeptide refers to a portion of a LmPDE polypeptide. For example, a LmPDE fragment can be a polypeptide with fewer amino acids than a full-length LmPDE, but having the biological activity of a full-length LmPDE-A, LmPDE-B1, or LmPDE-B2 polypeptide, e.g., the ability to hydrolyze cAMP. A fragment can also be a portion of a LmPDE polypeptide that elicits an immune response, or that possesses any other biological or diagnostic property of the full-length LmPDEs of the invention.",
                        "The term \u201cfragment\u201d of a LmPDE nucleic acid molecule refers to a portion of a full-length LmPDE nucleotide sequence. For example, such a nucleic acid fragment can encode a LmPDE polypeptide fragment that maintains the biological activity of a full-length LmPDE-A, LmPDE-B1, or LmPDE-B2 polypeptide, e.g., the ability to hydrolyze cAMP (as determined by methods known in the art, e.g., Schilling et al.

                        "Second messengers such as cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine mono-phosphate (cGMP) play important biological roles in modulating the effects of a wide variety of first messengers. For example, cAMP and cGMP are involved in the propagation of a variety of extracellular signals that originate from first messengers such as hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. The steady state intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP are controlled by their rates of synthesis by cyclases and by their rate of degradation by cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs).",
                        "PDEs are typically composed of a catalytic domain (approximately 270 amino acids), an N-terminal regulatory domain responsible for binding cofactors, and, in some cases, a C-terminal domain of unknown function. A conserved motif, HDXXHXGXXN, has been found in the catalytic domain of all PDEs. Several families of PDEs have been identified (Beavo (1995) Physiol. Rev. 75, 725-748; Soderling et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 15553-15558; and Fisher et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 15559-15564). PDE families display roughly 35% amino acid sequence identity within their catalytic domain. Isozymes within the same family typically display 75-95% sequence identity in this region. Within a family, there is often greater than 60% sequence identity outside the catalytic domain, whereas across different PDE families, there is little or no sequence similarity.",
                        "In eukaryotes, two distinct classes of PDEs have been identified. Class I enzymes all show significant amino acid sequence conservation within their catalytic domains. Class I PDEs include all currently known families of mammalian PDEs as well as several PDEs from lower eukaryotes such as PDE2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the regA gene product from Dictyostelium discoideum. Class II PDEs, however, share very little amino acid sequence identity with class I PDEs, and thus likely have a different evolutionary origin. Furthermore, class II PDEs are often distinguished by their generally higher KM values (Zoraghi et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11559-11566). Class II PDEs have been identified in yeast (Nikawa et al. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 3629-3636), the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (Lacombe et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16811-16817), Vibrio fisheri (Dunlap et al. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 4615-4624), and Candida albicans (Hoyer et al. (1994) Microbiology 140, 1533-1542).",
                        "A variety of diseases are thought to result from decreased levels of cyclic nucleotides due to increased PDE activity. Accordingly, PDEs have become highly attractive drug targets over the last several years. A growing number of family-specific and subtype-specific PDE inhibitors are being developed as therapeutic agents for a wide range of-diseases such as autoimmune disease (Bielekova et al. (2000) J. Immunol. 164, 1117-1124), arthritis (Kiely et al. (1995) Eur. J. Immunol. 25, 2899-2906), asthma (Barnette (1999) Prog. Drug Res. 53, 193-229), inflammatory diseases (Barnes (2001) Novartis Found. Symp. 234, 255-267) impotency (Langtry et al. (1999) Drugs 57, 967-989) and cancer (Marko et al. (2000) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 10, 944-948). So far, there is limited information about PDEs in kinetoplastids such as Leishmania major."

Particular embodiments of the LmPDE polypeptides of the invention include full-length LmPDE-A, LmPDE-B1, and LmPDE-B2 from Leishmania major.

Mutant alleles of LmPDEs encode mutant forms of LmPDE polypeptides having at least one amino acid substitution, insertion, deletion, truncation, or frame shift. Such mutant forms of polypeptides may not exhibit the same biological activity as wild-type proteins (e.g., they may have less PDE activity or an activity not normally found in LmPDE polypeptides, such as, for example, not functioning as a PDE).",
                                "Another variant of LmPDE polypeptides may have amino acid sequences that differ by one or more amino acid substitutions. The variant may have conservative amino acid changes, where a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties. Amino acid residues that can be conservatively substituted for one another include, but are not limited to: glycine/alanine; valine/isoleucine/leucine; asparagine/glutamine; aspartic acid/glutamic acid; serine/threonine; lysine/arginine; and phenylalanine/tyrosine. Other substitutions can also be considered conservative, depending on the environment of the particular amino acid and its role in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. For example, methionine, which is relatively hydrophobic, can frequently be interchanged with leucine and isoleucine, and sometimes with valine.",
                                "Alternatively, a variant may have nonconservative amino acid changes, such as, for example, replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan, or alanine with lysine. Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions and insertions. Any amino acid substitution that does not significantly affect the biological and/or chemical properties of LmPDE polypeptides is encompassed by the present invention. Guidance in determining which and how many amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted and deleted may be found using computer programs well known in the art such as the DNASTAR software package.",

For example, purified LmPDE protein molecules will be substantially free of other proteins or molecules that impair the binding of LmPDE proteins to antibodies or other ligands. Embodiments of LmPDE polypeptides include purified LmPDE polypeptides having the biological activity of a LmPDE protein.

A skilled artisan can readily determine and vary the stringency conditions appropriately to obtain a clear and detectable hybridization signal. Typical ranges of stringency conditions include: (1) low stringency (2\u00d7SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS, room temperature), (2) moderate stringency (0.2\u00d7SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS, 42\u00b0 C.), and (3) high stringency (0.1\u00d7SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS, 68\u00b0 C.).",

A variety of expression vector/host systems may be utilized to carry and express LmPDE nucleotide sequences. The host-vector system can be used to express (e.g., produce) LmPDE polypeptides encoded by LmPDE nucleotide sequences. The host cell can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Examples of suitable prokaryotic host cells include bacterial strains from genera such as Escherichia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Streptomyces. Examples of suitable eukaryotic host cells include yeast cells, plant cells, or animal cells such as mammalian cells and insect cells. Several possible embodiments provide a host-vector system comprising the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in COS-7 mammalian cells, pGEX vector (Promega, Madison, Wis.) in bacterial cells, pLT1 vector (S. Kunz, unpublished) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, or pFastBac HT baculovirus vector (Gibco/BRL) in Sf9 insect cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va.).",
                                "The introduction of the recombinant DNA molecules of the present invention into an appropriate host cell may be accomplished by well-known methods that depend on the type of vector and host system employed. For example, prokaryotic host cells are introduced (e.g., transformed) with nucleic acid molecules by electroporation or salt treatment methods (see, for example, Cohen et al. (1972) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 69, 2110; Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning supra). Vertebrate cells can be transformed with vectors containing recombinant DNAs by various methods, including electroporation, or cationic lipid or salt treatment (Graham et al. (1973) Virol. 52, 456; Wigler et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 1373-1376).",
                                "Successfully transformed cells, i.e., cells that contain a rDNA molecule of the present invention, can be identified by techniques well known in the art. For example, cells resulting from the introduction of recombinant DNA of the present invention are selected and cloned to produce single colonies. Cells from those colonies are harvested, lysed and their DNA content examined for the presence of the rDNA using a method such as that described by Southern (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 503, or Berent et al. (1985) Biotech. 3, 208. The proteins produced from the cell may also be assayed via a biochemical assay or immunological method.",
                                "In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be selected depending upon the use intended for the LmPDE polypeptides. For example, when large quantities of LmPDEs are needed for the induction of antibodies, vectors that direct high level expression of fusion proteins that are soluble and readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, the multifunctional E. coli cloning and expression vectors such as BLUESCRIPT (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.), into which a LmPDE nucleotide sequence may be ligated in-frame with sequences for the amino-terminal Met and the subsequent 7 residues of \u03b2-galactosidase so that a hybrid protein is produced; pIN vectors (Van Heeke & Schuster (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5503-5509); and the like. The pGEX vectors (Promega, Madison, Wis.) may also be used to express LmPDE polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. Proteins made in such systems are designed to include heparin, thrombin, or factor XA protease cleavage sites so that the cloned protein of interest can be released from the GST moiety at will.",
                                "In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) a number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters such as beta-factor, alcohol oxidase and PGH may be used. For reviews, see Ausubel et al. (supra) and Grant et al. (1987) Methods in Enzymology 153, 516-544.",
                                "In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of a sequence encoding a LmPDE polypeptide can be driven by several different promoters. For example, viral promoters such as the 35S and 19S promoters of CaMV (Brisson et al. (1984) Nature 310, 511-514) may be used alone or in combination with the omega leader sequence from TMV (Takamatsu et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 307-311). Alternatively, plant promoters such as the small subunit of RUBISCO (Coruzzi et al (1984) EMBO J. 3, 1671-1680; Broglie et al. (1984) Science 224, 838-843), or heat shock promoters (Winter et al. (1991) Results ProbL. Cell Differ. 17, 85-105) may be used. These constructs can be introduced into plant cells by direct DNA transformation or pathogen-mediated transfection. For reviews of such techniques, see Hobbs (1992) McGraw Yearbook of Science and Technology, McGraw Hill New York N.Y., pp. 191-196, or Weissbach and Weissbach (1988) Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, New York N.Y., pp. 421-463.",
                                "An alternative expression system that can be used to express LmPDE polypeptides is an insect system. In one such system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes in Spodoptera frugiperda cells or in Trichoplusia larvae (Smith et al. (1983) J. Virol. 46, 584; Engelhard et al. (1994) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 32a-4-3227). The sequence encoding a LmPDE polypeptide may be cloned into a nonessential region of the virus, such as the polyhedrin gene, and placed under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Successful insertion of a LmPDE nucleotide sequence will render the polyhedrin gene inactive and produce recombinant virus lacking coat protein. The recombinant viruses are then used to infect S. frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia larvae in which a LmPDE polypeptide is expressed.",
                                "In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems are utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, a LmPDE nucleotide sequence is ligated into an adenovirus transcription/translation vector consisting of the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. Insertion in a nonessential E1 or E3 region of the viral genome results in a viable virus (Logan et al. (1984) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 3655-3659) capable of expressing a LmPDE protein in infected host cells. In addition, transcription enhancers, such as the rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer, can be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.",
                                "A host cell strain may also be chosen for its ability to modulate the expression of the inserted LmPDE nucleotide sequences or to process the expressed LmPDE polypeptide in a particular manner. Such modifications of LmPDE polypeptides include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation and acylation. Post-translational processing which cleaves a precursor form of the protein may also be important for correct insertion, folding and/or function. Different host cells such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, WI38, etc. have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced, foreign protein.",
                                "For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines that stably express LmPDE polypeptides are transformed using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector, cells are grown in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth and recovery of cells which successfully express the introduced sequences. Resistant clumps of stably transformed cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate for the cell type used.",
                                "Any number of selection systems may be used to recover transformed cell lines. These include, but are not limited to, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) (Wigler et al. (1977) Cell 11, 223-232) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) (Lowy et al. (1980) Cell 22, 817-823) genes which can be employed in tk-minus or aprt-minus cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite, antibiotic or herbicide resistance can be used as the basis for selection. Examples include: dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al. (1980) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 77, 3567-3570); npt, which confers resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin and G-418 (Colbere-Garapin et al. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 150, 1-14) and als or pat, which confer resistance to chlorsulfaron and phosphinotricin acetyltransferase, respectively (Murry, supra).",
                                "Additional selectable genes have been described, for example, UpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan, or hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine (Hartman et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 8047-8051). Recently, the use of visible markers has gained popularity. Such markers include anthocyanins, \u03b2-glucuronidase and its substrate, GUS, and luciferase and its substrate, luciferin. These markers are widely used not only to identify transformants, but also to quantify the amount of transient or stable protein expression attributable to a specific vector system (Rhodes et al. (1995) Methods Mol. Biol. 55, 121-131)."

LmPDE polypeptides may be targets for therapeutic methods such as targeted antibody therapy and immunotherapy to treat conditions associated with the presence or absence of a LmPDE of the invention. Additionally, some of the antibodies of the invention may be internalizing antibodies, which internalize (e.g., enter) into the cell upon or after binding. Internalizing antibodies are useful for inhibiting cell growth and/or inducing cell death and for detecting or targeting LmPDEs within damaged or dying cells.",

As used herein, an antibody fragment is defined as at least a portion of the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule that binds to its target, i.e., the antigen-binding region. Some of the constant region of the immunoglobulin may be included. Fragments of the monoclonal antibodies or the polyclonal antisera include Fab, F(ab\u2032)2, Fv fragments, single-chain antibodies, and fusion proteins which include the immunologically significant portion (i.e., a portion that recognizes and binds a LmPDE).",

                                "Various methods for the preparation of antibodies are well known in the art. For example, antibodies may be prepared by immunizing a suitable mammalian host with an immunogen such as an isolated LmPDE polypeptide (Harlow (1989) Antibodies, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY). In addition, fusion proteins of LmPDEs may also be used as immunogens, such as a LmPDE fused to GST, human Ig, or His-tagged fusion proteins. Cells expressing or over-expressing LmPDE polypeptides-may also be used for immunizations. This strategy may result in the production of monoclonal antibodies with enhanced capacities for recognizing endogenous LmPDE polypeptides (Harlow et al. (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press).",

There are a number of well-known strategies one of ordinary skill in the art may use to produce human recombinant antibodies. One is the generation of antibodies using phage display technologies (Low et al. (1996). J Mol Biol 260(3):359-368; Winter et al. (1994). Annu Rev Immunol 12:433-455). Specifically, human RNA is used to produce a cDNA library of antibody heavy and light chain fragments expressed on the surface of bacteriophage. These libraries can be used to probe against the antigen of interest. The phage that bind, because of the antibody expressed on the surface, can then be isolated. The DNA encoding the variable regions is sequenced and cloned for antibody expression.",

                                "Recombinant human antibodies are also produced by isolating antibody-producing B cells from human volunteers that have a robust response against the antigen of interest. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescently labeled antigen, cells producing the antibodies directed against the antigen can be separated from the other cells. The RNA can then be extracted and the sequence of the reactive antibody variable regions determined (Kantor et al. (1995) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 764:224-227, Wang et al. (2000) J. Immunol. Methods 244:217-225). The DNA sequence of the functional variable regions can be synthesized or cloned into mammalian expression vectors for large-scale human recombinant antibody production.",

Regions of a LmPDE polypeptide that show immunogenic structure, as well as other regions and domains, can readily be identified using various other methods known in the art such as Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Kyte-Doolittle, Eisenberg, Karplus-Schultz or Jameson-Wolf analysis (Rost et al.

Together with the adenylyl cyclases, these phosphodiesterases ultimately control the biological responses mediated by the messenger cAMP. Regulation of intracellular levels of cAMP is crucial in the processes of cell transformation and proliferation.

The compounds of interest are identified from a population of candidate compounds. For example, a compound that effectively binds the target nucleic acid molecule can decrease expression of the LmPDE polypeptide, and thereby decrease proliferation of cells that express LmPDE polypeptides. Decreasing the proliferation of cells that express LmPDE polypeptides can be an effective method of treating diseases associated with the infection of parasites such as Leishmania major.",

                                "Compounds that modulate the activity and/or expression of a LmPDE polypeptide may also be based on antisense constructs. Therapeutic techniques based on an antisense approach involve the design of oligonucleotides that are complementary to LmPDE mRNAs. These oligonucleotides bind the complementary transcripts and prevent translation. Absolute (or total) complementarity is not required. An oligonucleotide may function as an effective antisense construct as long as its sequence is sufficiently complementary to be able to hybridize with RNA and form a stable duplex. In the case of a double-stranded antisense nucleic acid molecule, a single strand of the duplex may be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. In general, the longer the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with an RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex, as the case may be). One skilled in the art can determine a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.",
                                "Furthermore, several in vitro assays can be used to identify compounds that modulate the expression and/or the activity of a LmPDE polypeptide. Such assays typically involve preparation of a reaction mixture comprising a LmPDE polypeptide and a test compound under conditions sufficient to allow the two components to interact and bind, thus forming a complex that can be detected and/or isolated. The binding of a compound with a LmPDE polypeptide can be assayed using a shift in the molecular weight or a change in biological activity of the unbound LmPDE polypeptide, or the expression of a reporter gene in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fields et al. (1989) Nature 340, 245-246). The method used to identify whether a compound binds to a LmPDE polypeptide will be based primarily on the nature of the LmPDE polypeptide used. For example, a gel retardation assay can be used to determine whether a compound binds to a LmPDE polypeptide. Alternatively, immunodetection and biochip (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,019) technologies can be adopted for use with a LmPDE polypeptide. An alternative method for identifying compounds that bind with a LmPDE polypeptide employs TLC overlay assays using glycolipid extracts from immune-type cells (Abdullah et al. (1992) Infect. Immunol. 60, 56-62). Furthermore, a decrease in LmPDE cAMP hydrolytic activity can be measured to determine whether or not a particular compound is inhibiting a LmPDE. A skilled artisan can readily employ numerous techniques known in the art for determining whether a particular compound binds to a LmPDE polypeptide of the invention. Such assays will typically make use of a control cell.",
                                "It is also possible to use cell-based assays to identify compounds that interact with LmPDE polypeptides. Cell lines that naturally express LmPDEs or that have been genetically engineered to express LmPDEs can be used. For example, test compounds may be added to cell cultures after which the hydrolysis of cAMP can be measured using standard techniques known in the art. A decrease in the amount of hydrolysis in the presence of a test compound compared to control cells that do not contain the test compound indicates that the test compound is an inhibitor of LmPDE activity.",
                                "Inhibitors of LmPDE expression may be identified by using a chimeric gene in which a LmPDE nucleotide sequence is fused with a reporter, such as firefly luciferase. Cultured cells that have been transformed with the chimeric gene can be screened for the expression of luciferase activity in the presence of test compounds. Compounds that inhibit luciferase activity in this high throughput assay can also be confirmed by direct measurement for the presence of the endogenous LmPDE polypeptide (e.g. by Western blotting) and LmPDE mRNA (e.g. by Northern blotting) using methods that are well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons). Candidate compounds can be further tested in cell or tissue cultures as well as in animal models. Cells expressing a LmPDE polypeptide, for example, can be incubated with a test compound, after which cell lysates are prepared and probed for the presence of the LmPDE polypeptide (e.g. using Western blotting techniques). A decrease in the amount of LmPDE expression in cultures treated with the test compound compared to control cultures without the test compound indicates that the test compound is an inhibitor of LmPDE expression.",
                                "In vivo assays can also be used to test these compounds in animal models of Leishmania infection. Test compounds predicted to inhibit LmPDE activity and/or expression are administered to the animals. The treated animals can then be assayed for inhibition of LmPDE activity. Such assays may be indirect or inferential. Improved health, for example, may indicate the efficacy of a test compound. Direct assays may also be performed where a decrease in LmPDE expression can be measured by a Northern blotting analysis. A decrease in the amount of LmPDE mRNA present in the sample from treated animals compared to untreated control animals indicates that the test compound inhibits LmPDE expression. A direct assay may also be performed that measures the hydrolytic activity of a LmPDE on cAMP. A decrease in hydrolysis of cAMP in the sample from treated animals compared to the untreated control animals indicates that the test compound inhibits LmPDE activity.",

A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the source of the cellular extracts used in the screening methods of the present invention.",
                                "Compounds that are identified as candidates for inhibiting the activity and/or expression of a LmPDE polypeptide, when administered in a therapeutically effective amount, may be useful for treating diseases and reducing symptoms associated with the infection of Leishmania, such as leishmaniasis. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of identified compounds that modulate the activity and/or expression of a LmPDE polypeptide can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures. For example, using either cells in culture or experimental animals, the dose lethal to 50% of the population (LD50) can be determined. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds with a large therapeutic index are preferred. While compounds that have toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thus reduce side effects.",
                                "The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administrations used. For any compound used in the method of the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.",

                                "Another aspect of the invention provides transgenic organisms comprising LmPDE nucleic acids. As used herein, a genetically modified organism refers to an organism that has been altered from its natural state by manipulation of the native nucleic acid sequences. For example, in one application, PDE-deficient organisms can be generated using standard knock-out procedures to inactivate an endogenous PDE. Alternatively, inducible PDE anti-sense molecules can be used to regulate the activity and/or expression of the endogenous PDE. An organism can also be produced so as to contain a LmPDE-encoding nucleic acid molecule or an antisense-LmPDE expression unit that directs the expression of a LmPDE polypeptide or the antisense molecule. In such cases, an organism is generated in which the expression of the endogenous PDE gene is altered by inactivation and/or replaced by a LmPDE gene. This can be accomplished using a variety of procedures known in the art such as targeted recombination. Once generated, the endogenous PDE-deficient organism that expresses a LmPDE polypeptide can be used to (1) identify biological and pathological processes mediated by LmPDE polypeptides, (2) identify proteins and other genes that interact with LmPDE polypeptides, (3) identify compounds that can be exogenously supplied to inhibit a LmPDE polypeptide, and (4) serve as an appropriate screen for identifying mutations within LmPDE genes that increase or decrease activity.",
                                "For example, in one embodiment, the endogenous PDE genes in S. cerevisiae can be deleted, which results in intracellular accumulation of cAMP. Organisms that accumulate high levels of intracellular cAMP cease to grow when exposed to a heat shock. LmPDE nucleic acid molecules can then be cloned into a yeast expression vector and transfected into the PDE-deficient strain of S. cerevisiae. Restoration of heat-insensitive growth is thus a marker for LmPDE activity. Observing whether or not heat-insensitive growth is restored to the transfected strain under various conditions can indicate the effects these conditions have on LmPDE activity.",

It is known that cAMP plays a key role in cell growth and differentiation in this parasite and that PDEs are responsible for the hydrolysis of this messenger. Therefore, as discussed above, LmPDEs are targets for drug screening assays and are useful in accomplishing selective drug design.",
                                "Additionally, the invention provides methods for monitoring the course of disease or disorders associated with the presence of LmPDEs in a test subject by measuring the amount of a LmPDE polypeptide in a sample from the test subject at various points in time. This is done for purposes of determining a change in the amount of a LmPDE in the sample over time. Monitoring the course of a disease or disorder over time may optimize the timing, dosage, and type of treatment. In one embodiment, the method comprises quantitatively determining in a first sample from the subject the presence of a LmPDE polypeptide and comparing the amount so determined with the amount present in a second sample from the same subject taken at a different point in time, a difference in the amounts determined being indicative of the course of the disease. Measuring the amount of LmPDE polypeptide present in a sample can be performed using a variety of techniques well known in the art, for example by using immunoassays as discussed below.",

The LmPDE nucleotide sequences from genomic libraries are useful for isolating upstream or downstream non-coding sequences, such as promoter, enhancer, and transcription termination sequences. The upstream sequences from a LmPDE gene may be joined to non-LmPDE sequences in order to construct a recombinant DNA molecule that expresses the non-LmPDE sequence upon introduction into an appropriate host cell. In another embodiment, a LmPDE probe is used to screen cDNA libraries to isolate cDNA clones expressed in certain tissues or cell types.",

One embodiment encompasses determining the amount of LmPDE nucleotide sequences present within the suitable biological sample such as in specific cell types, tissues, or body fluids, using a LmPDE probe in a hybridization procedure. The amount of LmPDE nucleic acid molecules in the test sample can be compared with the amount of LmPDE nucleic acid molecules in a reference sample from a normal subject. The presence of a measurably different amount of LmPDE nucleic acid molecules between the test and reference samples may correlate with the presence or with the severity of a disease associated with abnormal levels (high or low) of LmPDE nucleic acid molecules as compared to normal levels.",

In a similar manner, a biological sample from a normal subject is contacted with a LmPDE probe and hybridized under similar conditions. The presence of the nucleic acid molecules hybridized to the probe is detected.

A BLAST search was performed using the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the trypanosomal enzyme TbPDE1, which identified a nucleotide sequence in Leishmania major that shares 45.1% amino acid sequence identity (determined using the BESTFIT utility of the GCG program suite with default parameters). This novel sequence was labeled LmPDE-A. The gene for LmPDE-A is located within a sequence cluster consisting of chromosomes 18, 20, and 22. A BLAST search was also performed using the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the trypanosomal enzyme TbPDE2C, which identified two closely related sequences that were subsequently labeled LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2. LmPDE-BI shares 70.2% amino acid identity with the query sequence TbPDE2C, while LmPDE-B2 shares 69.8% overall sequence identity with TbPDE2C. Overall amino acid sequence identity between LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 is 84.5%. According to the Leishmania genome database, the identified LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 loci are located on chromosome 15."

PCR primers were also designed to amplify only the open reading frame portion of the three full-length genes. The primers were designed to contain a Sall site for in-frame cloning into the pLT1 vector (where the ATG-initiation codon is provided by the vector) and to code for a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag. For LmPDE-A, the forward and reverse primers were designed as follows: forward\u20145\u2032-gtggtcgactcgactttcttgagcag-3\u2032 (nucleotides 4-21 of the open reading frame, which correspond to nucleotides 533-550 in FIG. 2); reverse\u20145\u2032-ptgggaatcctaagcataatctggaacatcatatggatacgagtcgtcgtggttgg-3\u2032 (nucleotides 1896-1877 of the open reading frame\u2014which correspond to nucleotides 2425-2406 in FIG. 2\u2014and HA-tag).

The genes of Leishmania major, as with other kinetoplastids, do not contain introns. Accordingly, amplification of open reading frames directly from genomic DNA is routinely performed (Beverley (2003) Nat. Rev. Genet. 4, 11 19). Both strands of all three PCR fragments (LmPDE-A, LmPDE-B1, and LmPDE-B2) were then cloned via the TA-overhang into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO following the instructions of the kit supplied by Invitrogen. The clones were then sequenced using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). Both strands of each clone were sequenced at least two times for verification.",

The full-length nucleotide sequence of LmPDE-B1, which is 7,095 nucleotides in length, is shown in FIG. 4, where the open reading frame begins with adenine at position 1267 and ends with adenine at position 4059, and the corresponding amino acid sequence is set forth in FIG. 3.

The 3\u2032-untranslated regions of the two genes had inadvertently been swapped. The correct organization of these two genes was then established by Southern blot analysis of a series of restriction digests of L. major genomic DNA (as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9). Lane 8 of each hybridization (Notl/Scal double digest) shall be used as an example for the analytical reasoning. If the sequence assembly in the database were correct, a Notl/Scal double digest should yield a fragment of at least 8 kb when hybridized with a LmPDE-B2-specific probe (since no Scal restriction site is present in the immediate 3\u2032-region of LmPDE-B2 gene). In contrast to this prediction, the data show a 4 kb fragment is generated, demonstrating the presence of a Scal restriction site close to the 3\u2032-end of the LmPDE-B2 gene. All additional digests shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 support, or are compatible with this conclusion. In addition to establishing the genomic organization of the LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 genes, these experiments demonstrated that each is a single-copy gene. The hybridization probes used in the Southern blotting analysis were as follows: LmPDE-A-specific: nucleotides 462-910 of the open reading frame (corresponding to nucleotides 991-1439 in FIG. 2); LmPDE-B1-specific: nucleotides 96489 of the open reading frame (corresponding to nucleotides 1362-1755 in FIG. 4); LmPDE-B2-specific: 106-417 of the open reading frame (corresponding to 2287-3936 in FIG. 6). This analysis also confirmed that LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 are tandemly arranged and separated by about 5 kb on chromosome 15 as shown in FIG. 11."

The cloning site is flanked by a strong TEF2 promotor followed by an optimized Kozak box, and by a Cyc1 terminator. PDE-deficient S. cerevisiae accumulate intracellular cAMP, which results in a heat-sensitive phenotype. In particular, no growth is observed after a 15 minute heat shock at 55\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 12, both LmPDE-A and LmPDE-B1 fully complemented this phenotype and restored heat-shock insensitive growth. For a heat-shock assay, patches were streaked onto SC-met-ura plates and grown for 2 days at 30\u00b0 C. The patches were then replicated onto a plate pre-warmed to 55\u00b0 C. The plate was incubated for an additional 15 min at 55\u00b0 C., let cool to room temperature and was then incubated for 1-2 days at 30\u00b0 C. These findings demonstrate that both LmPDE-A and LmPDE-B1 constructs produce active enzymes and that both enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing cAMP.

The 3H-adenosine formed as a reaction product was eluted with 1.6 ml of 30 mM ammonium formiate, pH 6.0 and was collected into 3.5 ml of water-soluble scintillation fluid (Packard Ultima Flo). Assays were performed in triplicate, and data were analyzed using the Graph Pad Prism software package.",

                                "Lysates prepared from yeast expressing LmPDE-A consistently showed no measurable PDE activity. This observation is consistent with the finding that LmPDE-A is less efficient than LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 at complementing the PDE deficiency of the host strain PP5. In addition, these findings are very similar to the observations made with the trypanosomal homologue TbPDE1. For example, TbPDE1 complemented the PDE deficiency of PP5 cells but its effect was less than that of other trypanosomal or human PDEs, and no enzymatic activity was detectable in the corresponding yeast cell lysates (Kunz et al. (2004) Eur. J. Biochem. 271, 637-647).",
                                "In contrast to lysates from LmPDE-A expressing cells, lysates from yeast strains expressing LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 showed strong PDE activities. Both enzymes exhibited very similar KM values for cAMP that were within the range of other class I PDEs (Zoraghi et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11559-11566; Rascon et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 471-44719; Zoraghi et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 4343-4348; Francis et al. (2001) Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 65, 1-52; Mou and Cote (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27527-27534). In addition, the presence of a 100-fold excess of cGMP did not affect the rate of hydrolysis of cAMP by LmPDE-B1 (compare FIG. 13B with FIG. 13A). A 50-fold excess of the reaction product 5\u2032-AMP also had no effect on KM (nor Kcat) (FIG. 13C). Similar results were obtained with LmPDE-B2 (data not shown). Therefore, LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 are cAMP-specific PDEs.",
                                "These data are in good agreement with the finding that no cGMP-hydrolyzing activity is detectable in whole cell extracts from Leishmania major (data not shown). Because PDE-catalyzed hydrolysis is the only mechanism by which a cell can dispose of its cyclic nucleotides (except for possible export mechanisms; Guo et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 29509-29514), the absence of a cGMP-hydrolyzing PDE activity from Leishmanial cells suggests that cGMP signaling may not exist in Leishmania major.",

                                "FIG. 14 shows the effects of several commercially available PDE inhibitors (100 \u03bcM) on LmPDE-B1 and LmPDE-B2 activity in the presence of 1 \u03bcM cAMP. Both enzymes were insensitive to the broad spectrum PDE inhibitor IBMX but were partly sensitive to trequinsin, dipyridamole, and etazolate. Trequinsin and dipyridamole inhibited LmPDE-B1 activity with IC50 values of 96.6 and 22.6 \u03bcM, respectively.",
                                "The observed inhibitor profile, including the fact that dipyridamole and trequinsin were the most potent compounds, closely corresponds to that reported previously for trypanosomal PDEs (Zoraghi et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11559-11566; Zoraghi et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 4343-4348; Rascon et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 4714-4719). The fact that several potent and specific inhibitors of different human PDEs had no effect on the Leishmanial PDEs strongly suggests that the development of Leishmania-specific PDE inhibitors is feasible."
