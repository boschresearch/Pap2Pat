    "title": "A Highly Specific Monoclonal Antibody for Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A-Cleaved SNAP25",
    "date": "2015-06-24",
    "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNT/A), as onabotulinumtoxinA, is approved globally for 11 major therapeutic and cosmetic indications. While the mechanism of action for BoNT/A at the presynaptic nerve terminal has been established, questions remain regarding intracellular trafficking patterns and overall fate of the toxin. Resolving these questions partly depends on the ability to detect BoNT/A's location, distribution, and movement within a cell. Due to BoNT/A's high potency and extremely low concentrations within neurons, an alternative approach has been employed. This involves utilizing specific antibodies against the BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 substrate (SNAP25197) to track the enzymatic activity of toxin within cells. Using our highly specific mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against SNAP25197, we generated human and murine recombinant versions (rMAb) using specific backbone immunoglobulins. In this study, we validated the specificity of our anti-SNAP25197 rMAbs in several different assays and performed side-by-side comparisons to commercially-available and in-house antibodies against SNAP25. Our rMAbs were highly specific for SNAP25197 in all assays and on several different BoNT/A-treated tissues, showing no cross-reactivity with full-length SNAP25. This was not the case with other reportedly SNAP25197-selective antibodies, which were selective in some, but not all assays. The rMAbs described herein represent effective new tools for detecting BoNT/A activity within cells.",

                "Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) causes transient muscle paralysis through presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The therapeutic utility of BoNT/A has grown considerably over the past several decades and Allergan\u2019s product, onabotulinumtoxinA, is now approved globally for 11 (10 US) major therapeutic and cosmetic indications [1,2]. These indications include treatment for disorders of skeletal muscle (e.g., cervical dystonia, upper and lower limb spasticity) [3,4], smooth muscle (e.g., idiopathic and neurogenic detrusor overactivity) [5,6], autonomic nerves (e.g., axillary hyperhidrosis) [7] and nociceptive pain mechanisms (e.g., chronic migraine) [8,9].",
                "While the general mechanism of action (MoA) for BoNT/A at the presynaptic nerve terminal has been well established [10,11], there are still many unanswered questions regarding the intracellular trafficking patterns and general \u201clife-cycle\u201d of the toxin. Resolving these questions partly depends on the ability to precisely detect the toxin\u2019s location, distribution, and movement within a cell. Direct detection of BoNT/A using antibodies has been difficult due to its high potency and therefore, extremely low concentrations within neurons [12,13]. An alternative approach for detecting the presence of BoNT/A has been to track its enzymatic activity via immuno-staining for the cleaved SNAP25 product.",
                "Following internalization and translocation of the light chain into the cytosol, BoNT/A cleaves its substrate SNAP25 at amino acid 197 (SNAP25197), removing the last nine amino acids of the protein [14,15]. The resulting new terminal epitope that is generated is difficult to specifically target with an antibody without also recognizing the intact SNAP25 protein [16]. Additionally, the specificity of any given SNAP25197 antibody may be assay, tissue or species-dependent. This would suggest that an antibody to SNAP25197 should ideally be tested under multiple conditions and tissue types to determine its specificity for BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 in all applications.",
                "A number of recently published studies have employed either a proprietary rabbit polyclonal antibody [17,18,19,20,21] or a commercially-available monoclonal antibody [22,23] to track SNAP25197 presence in the rodent central nervous system and bladder, respectively. The SNAP25197-positive staining observed in these studies was purported as being indicative for the presence of active BoNT/A. However, various inconsistencies between these studies and the lack of specific control experiments suggest that the observed SNAP25197 immuno-reactive (IR) signal may misrepresent the neuronal trafficking patterns of the active toxin.",
                "In an effort to address BoNT/A mechanistic questions, we have generated highly specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against SNAP25197 using a twelve residue peptide antigen containing amino acids 186-197 from the terminal carboxylated region of the BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 protein. One of these mAbs (2E2A6) is used in Allergan\u2019s cell-based potency assay for BOTOX\u00ae (Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) [24,25]. The variable regions of a second mAb (3C1A5), selected for its superior performance in immunohistochemical (IHC) assays on muscle tissue [26], were sequenced and recombinantly engineered into immunoglobulin backbones from either human (IgG1) or murine (IgG2A) origin. This was done in order to reduce background and cross-staining and to allow for species-specific co-localization studies. In the present study, we validated the specificity of our recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rMAb) in several different assays and performed a side-by-side comparison with various commercially-available and in-house produced antibodies directed against SNAP25."

                        "The primary antibodies used in the current study are listed in Table 1. The antibody comparison was first performed using Western blot (WB) analysis. We compared our recombinant anti-SNAP25197 monoclonal antibodies against both commercially available antibodies and our in-house rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) [27] in their ability to recognize the full-length (206) or BoNT/A-cleaved (197) forms of SNAP25 from rat embryonic cortical cell lysates treated with or without BoNT/A (Figure 1). A commercially available and widely-used monoclonal antibody (SMI-81R) directed against all forms of the SNAP25 protein recognized both SNAP25206 and SNAP25197 (Figure 1A). In contrast, a second commercially available monoclonal antibody (MC-6050) described [28] as recognizing both forms of SNAP25 was surprisingly specific for SNAP25197 in lysates from toxin-treated cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore, another antibody from the same company (MC-6053), described [29] as recognizing only BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 revealed a thin, faint band exclusively in the toxin-treated lane (Figure 1C).",
                        "Our human (Ab632) and murine (Ab635) rMAbs directed against BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 were very specific for SNAP25197; only a single band was detected in toxin-treated lysates, while no bands were detected in the untreated, control lanes (Figure 1D, E). Similarly, our in-house rabbit pAb (RGT-1092) against SNAP25197 only detected a band in the BoNT/A-treated sample, while no bands were detected in the control lane (Figure 1F). We did note however, that the pAb recognized two additional faint bands, one just above the SNAP25197 band and another at ~20 kDa present only in toxin-treated samples, which could not be readily explained. Nevertheless, the upper band is not likely to be intact SNAP25, as no band was observed in the untreated lane. Similar WB results were obtained using lysates from BoNT/A-treated and untreated SiMa cell cultures (Figure S1), except that no band was observed for MC-6053 in either control or toxin-treated lanes (Figure S1C). Control blots probed for GAPDH showed equal loading of all samples for both cortical and SiMa cell lysate experiments (Figure S2).",
                        "A separate WB analysis was performed to examine the epitope specificity of our rMAbs using BoNT/C- and BoNT/E-treated SiMa cell lysates compared to the BoNT/A-treated lysate. It is well established that BoNT/C cleaves SNAP25 at amino acid (aa) residue 198, while BoNT/E cleaves SNAP25 at aa residue 180 [11]. While the SMI-81R mAb recognized both full length and BoNT-cleaved forms of SNAP25 (Figure S2C), our human rMAb only detected a single band in the BoNT/A-treated lysate sample, as expected (Figure S2D)."

                        "The specificity of the antibodies was then tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in rat bladder and glabrous skin that had been treated with either onabotulinumtoxinA or saline. Throughout these IHC studies, adjacent sections processed without primary antibodies showed only background staining (Figure S3E,F). In rat bladder, the SMI-81R antibody directed against SNAP25 showed IR-signal in nerve fibers throughout the detrusor muscle. The SNAP25-IR pattern was identical in both onabotulinumtoxinA and saline-treated bladders, as expected (Figure 2A,F). The MC-6050 monoclonal antibody, which is reported to recognize both intact and BoNT/A-cleaved forms of SNAP25, demonstrated IR-signal in nerve fibers from the detrusor muscle of toxin-treated, but not saline-treated bladder (Figure 2B,G), comparable to the results from the Western blot analysis. Likewise, the MC-6053 monoclonal antibody demonstrated IR-signal only in toxin-treated, but not saline-treated bladder (Figure 2C,H). In contrast with the specificity detected in the WB analysis, RGT-1092 pAb generated against SNAP25197 demonstrated IR-signal in both toxin-treated and saline-treated bladders (Figure 2E,J). Most importantly, Ab632-rMAb showed clear IR-signal in nerve fibers from the detrusor muscle of toxin-treated bladders (Figure 2D), while no signal was detected in saline-treated control bladders (Figure 2I). Moreover, in separate studies, Ab635-rMAb showed similar specificity as Ab632-rMAb to SNAP25197 in rat bladder (Figure S3A,C).",
                        "In rat glabrous skin, the SMI-81R antibody exhibited IR-signal in nerve fibers surrounding blood vessels (among other skin regions). As expected for this antibody, the SNAP25-IR pattern was identical in both onabotulinumtoxinA and saline-treated skin (Figure 3A,F). The MC-6050 monoclonal antibody demonstrated IR-signal primarily in nerve fibers from toxin-treated skin. However, slight IR-signal was also evident in nerve fibers from saline-treated skin (Figure 3B,G). The MC-6050 antibody also showed strong IR-signal in the lumen of blood vessels (Figure 3B,G). But as this particular IR-signal was never demonstrated by other SNAP25 antibodies, it was determined to be non-specific. Similarly, the MC-6053 monoclonal antibody showed IR-specific signal in nerve fibers surrounding blood vessels from both toxin and saline-treated skin, as well as non-specific signal in the lumen of blood vessels (Figure 3C,H). Once again, RGT-1092 pAb generated against SNAP25197 demonstrated IR-signal in both toxin-treated and saline-treated rat skin (Figure 3E,J), suggesting that despite its specificity in WB analysis, this antibody is not amenable for IHC. In clear contrast, Ab632-rMAb exhibited IR-signal in nerve fibers only in toxin-treated, but not in saline-treated skin (Figure 3D,I) supporting its superb specificity. Ab635-rMAb showed similar specificity as Ab632-rMAb to SNAP25197 in rat glabrous skin (Figure S3B,D).",
                        "Our samples of rat glabrous skin often contain underlying skeletal muscle, providing an excellent opportunity to validate our rMAbs on their ability to recognize BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 within motor nerve terminals (MNT). Similar results for antibody specificity were observed in MNTs as in other skin nerve fiber-types (Figure S4). While the SMI-81R mAb recognized both full length and BoNT/A-cleaved forms of SNAP25 in MNTs and axons, the commercial mAbs, MC-6050 and MC-6053 demonstrated IR-signal primarily in nerve fibers from toxin-treated skin. However, non-specific IR-signal was also observed in saline-treated tissue for these commercial mAbs (Figure S4F,G). In contrast, Ab632-rMAb exhibited IR-signal in MNTs and axons only in toxin-treated, but not in saline-treated skin (Figure S4D,H).",
                        "Among the commercially available antibodies against SNAP25, the MC-6053 monoclonal antibody targeting SNAP25197 is most similar to our murine Ab635-rMAb with regard to the type and species of antibody (Table 1). We therefore performed a head-to-head comparison of the SNAP25-IR expression patterns between our Ab635-rMAb and the MC-6053 mAb in biopsy samples of onabotulinumtoxinA and saline-treated human back skin. The presumption was that since this was a probe of human tissue using a mouse antibody, the non-specific IR-signal (regardless of the source) would be minimal. In general, the IR-signal for both antibodies was observed in nerve fibers surrounding blood vessels and sweat glands within the skin (Figure 4). IR-signal for the MC-6053 mAb was observed in nerve fibers from both onabotulinumtoxinA and saline-treated back skin. In sharp contrast, IR-signal for our murine Ab635-rMAb was only observed in nerve fibers from onabotulinumtoxinA-treated, but not saline-treated human back skin (Figure 4) demonstrating its superior specificity and more importantly, its utility as a clinical diagnostics tool."

Therefore, in order to complete our analysis, we compared the IR-signal from several of the antibodies in DRG cell cultures that were treated with either BoNT/A (3 nM) or saline. As in the tissues, the SMI-81R antibody showed strong IR-signal in both BoNT/A and saline-treated cultures (Figure 5A,D). Both the MC-6053 commercially available mAb and our human Ab632-rMAb demonstrated specific SNAP25197-IR signal in neuronal cells from BoNT/A-treated cultures (Figure 5B,C). No signal was detected in saline-treated cultures (Figure 5E,F). However, the MC-6053 mAb exhibited a faint background signal over the neuronal soma in the saline-treated cultures (Figure 5E). The results listing each antibody and its apparent specificity to either full length (206) or BoNT/A-cleaved (197) forms of SNAP25 in individual assays from the current study are summarized and presented in Table 2."

                "The presence of active BoNT/A in cells expressing SNAP25 can often be determined by using a selective antibody against the cleaved substrate (SNAP25197). In the present study, we introduce several rMAbs that were developed in-house against SNAP25197 and compared their immuno-reactive signal against that of commercial antibodies using a variety of different methods (Table 2). Both our human and murine rMAbs consistently detected SNAP25197 in all assays and on different tissues, and as expected, did not detect full-length SNAP25 (SNAP25206). This was not the case with other purportedly SNAP25197-selective antibodies, which displayed variable assay-dependent specificity. These results confirm that the BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 epitope is difficult to target specifically with an antibody without also recognizing the intact SNAP25 protein, which could lead to potential misinterpretation of results if the proper controls are not in place. Therefore, any given SNAP25197 antibody should be tested under multiple conditions and tissue types to ensure its fidelity in detecting the presence of BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25."

                        "Previous studies in the literature characterizing the activity of BoNT/A in the rodent CNS have relied, in part, on a proprietary rabbit pAb against SNAP25197. This pAb was employed in WB and IHC assays to track SNAP25197 protein expression in the rat hippocampus, retinotectal pathway and in facial motor neurons following BoNT/A injections into those regions [17,20,21]. In addition, other investigators utilizing this antibody have shown SNAP25197-immunoreactive nerve fibers within dorsal and ventral spinal cord following BoNT/A peripheral and intraneural injections [18,19]. In all, the SNAP25197-positive staining observed in these studies was purported as being indicative for the presence of active BoNT/A in both primary and second-order neurons. Consequently, these and other data have formed the basis for an emerging hypothesis that BoNT/A administered peripherally undergoes cellular transport and transcytosis within the CNS [30,31].",
                        "Curiously, in a recent study focusing on a chronic constriction injury mouse model of neuropathic pain, investigators using this same rabbit anti-SNAP25197 pAb reported IR-staining primarily in GFAP-labeled Schwann cells in the sciatic nerve and in spinal astrocytes following interplantar injection of BoNT/A [32]. In contrast, a separate study using a rat orofacial pain model examined SNAP25197 expression in the trigeminal ganglion following BoNT/A injections into the whisker pad and found no IR-staining in the surrounding glia or in second-order neurons with the same pAb [33]. While the observed differences between these various studies may be due to the experimental setup, animal species used or sensory region examined, these discrepancies and the lack of critical control experiments suggest that the IR-signal from the published anti-SNAP25197 rabbit pAb may be inconsistent and misleading.",
                        "The data from our own anti-SNAP25197 rabbit pAb support this view. Our rabbit pAb demonstrated clear selectivity for SNAP25197 in WB analysis as well as other in vitro assays [34], although some faint non-specific bands were still observed (Figure 1F and Figure S1). However, this pAb did not work well for IHC, as evidence by the IR signal observed in different tissues with or without BoNT/A treatment (Table 2). In fact, the results from our rabbit pAb in tissues were visibly different than those of the mAbs, indicating the advantage of using monoclonal antibodies, in general, for identifying the SNAP25197 antigen."

According to the accompanying documentation, MC-6050 is specific for both intact (SNAP25206) and BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 (SNAP25197) [28], while MC-6053 only recognizes the BoNT/A-cleaved form of SNAP25 [29]. Several studies have utilized the SNAP25197-specific commercial mAb (MC-6053) by IHC analysis to examine the distribution of SNAP25197 in the guinea pig bladder following injections of BoNT/A into the detrusor muscle [22,23]. These investigators found SNAP25197-IR in both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic innervation as well as in sensory nerve fibers within guinea pig bladder and intramural ganglia. In these studies, the specificity of the MC-6053 mAb was not assessed by WB, or any other type of analysis.",
                        "Our assessment of the commercial anti-SNAP25 mAbs revealed a diverse set of results. In WB analysis, the MC-6050 anti-SNAP25206/197 mAb only recognized SNAP25197 in both cortical and SiMa cell lysates, while the MC-6053 anti-SNAP25197 mAb recognized SNAP25197 in cortical, but not SiMa cell lysates. In IHC analysis of rat tissues, both mAbs demonstrated SNAP25197-specific signal in nerve fibers from onabotulinumtoxinA-treated bladder, but these mAbs did not show clear specificity in rat skin. Similarly, the MC-6053 mAb was not specific for SNAP25197 in human skin tissue, demonstrating IR-signal in nerve fibers from both onabotulinumtoxinA- and saline-treated skin. These mixed results may be due to the fact that both antibodies were generated to a relatively long (15-mer) peptide antigen sequence. This could produce antibodies that may not have selectivity across different species [16,35]. Nevertheless, the results observed with the commercial antibodies and the discrepancies with the manufacturer\u2019s description casts doubts as to their specificity and broad utility for IHC. In contrast, the data presented herein using our SNAP25197 rMAbs demonstrate their excellent specificity, versatility and consistency for detecting the presence of active BoNT/A in a broad range of assays."

These antibodies can detect sites of phosphorylation or sites of enzymatic cleavage and are invaluable tools for our understanding of the maturation, activity and degradation of proteins [16,35,36]. Within the field of botulinum neurotoxins, cleavage site-specific antibodies can help detect the activity of minute quantities of BoNT light-chain that may otherwise be very difficult to perceive. To that end, the use of polyclonal antibodies may have more limited utility because a mixed immunoglobulin population could be produced, not all of which would have the required specificity for the cleavage epitope [16]. Furthermore, the peptide antigen should be relatively short in order to reduce the possibility of generating antibodies that bind to a part of the sequence remote from the target epitope.",

The rMAbs (Ab632 and Ab635) that were subsequently generated from this antibody demonstrated superb specificity to BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP25 in several different assays, including IHC. Furthermore, these rMAbs showed superior SNAP25197 specificity compared to other antibodies tested (Table 2). Accordingly, our rMAbs represent effective new tools for the detection of BoNT/A activity within cells and in clinical samples, and can be utilized in future studies to characterize the effects of BoNT/A in tissues of interest."

Control animals received 10 \u00b5L injections of vehicle (0.9% saline) into comparable target sites. For glabrous skin injections, onabotulinumtoxinA (30 U/kg) or vehicle was administered as a single intradermal (ID) injection (25 \u00b5L) into the center of the right hindlimb paw between the footpads.
