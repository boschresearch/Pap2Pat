                        "The density of transistors in integrated circuits has been following Moore's law since its conception. (See, e.g., Reference 5). However, as the size of transistors approaches the size of a single atom, the laws of quantum physics play an increasingly dominant role in computer architectures, making it difficult for this trend to continue much longer. Despite this, the prospect of utilizing quantum mechanical phenomena in information processing offers an opportunity to increase the computational power of computers beyond what is known to be possible on even the most ideal classical computer. (See, e.g., References 5 and 6). Much like the classical computer depends on the robustness of the transistor, functional quantum computers can require an on-chip physical component with reproducible properties that can be incorporated into large scale structures.",
                        "One of the leading candidates for the quantum analog of the transistor is the gate-defined, semiconductor, quantum dot. (See, e.g., References 8 and 9). The spin state of an electron trapped in a quantum dot can be a beneficial physical system for storing quantum information. (See, e.g., References 10 and 12). Silicon (\u201cSi\u201d) in particular, with its weak hyperfine fields, small spin-orbit coupling and lack of piezoelectric electron-phonon coupling, forms a \u201csemiconductor vacuum\u201d for spin states (see, e.g., Reference 13), and supports seconds-long electron spin coherence times. (See, e.g., Reference 14). However, the fabrication of reliable and scalable Si-based quantum dots has proved challenging. Independent of the need for a pure spin environment, quantum dots should have reproducible electrical properties for scaling. The large effective mass of electrons in Si, along with the typically lower mobilities of Si two-dimensional (\u201c2D\u201d) electron gases, makes the fabrication of tightly confined, few-electron, quantum dots with reproducible properties difficult. (See, e.g., Reference 15).",
                        "Early quantum dot gate architectures were fabricated on doped Gallium Arsenide/Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (\u201cGaAs/AlGaAs\u201d) substrates in which conduction electrons are provided by a global dopant layer, and can be confined to the GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well (\u201cQW\u201d) interface forming a two-dimensional electron gas (\u201c2DEG\u201d). In these doped structures, by default, the 2DEG is filled with conduction electrons. Therefore, gate designs attempted to isolate a single conduction electron by fabricating gate electrodes in a corral pattern that could potentially create a circular barrier by applying negative voltages on the gates to deplete the 2DEG directly beneath the gates. (See, e.g., Reference 1). Devices utilizing this type of gate pattern have been referred to as depletion mode devices.",
                        "Depletion mode devices have been very successful in demonstrating the criteria for quantum computation (see, e.g., Reference 2), and are still in widespread use throughout the quantum dot community. However, there are major drawbacks to depletion mode devices with respect to control of the confinement potential and scaling. The gate patterns in depletion mode devices likely have the most control over the electrostatic potential surrounding the dot, rather than having direct control over the region of space where the electron wavefunction resides. This inability to control the electron wavefunction has led to a large variety of depletion mode gate designs, most of which do not provide a straightforward path for scaling to tens or hundreds of quantum dots.",
                        "The use of the quantum dots in quantum computing architectures generally depends on the ability to control the confinement potential of the quantum dot, and more specifically the ability to control the physically relevant parameters of the quantum dot, (e.g., tunnel coupling and the electrochemical potential). However, depletion mode devices have very limited control over the confinement potential. Simulations of the depletion mode quantum dot devices have shown that the resulting confinement potential can be much smaller than the gate dimensions. (See e.g., Reference 3). Because of such a situation, neighboring gates usually have a similar effect on the dot's tunnel couplings and electrochemical potential, and often it's not possible in depletion mode devices to tune the tunnel couplings and electrochemical potential to the desired values without going to such extreme voltages that dielectric breakdown occurs in the device. (See, e.g., Reference 4).",
                        "Quantum computing architectures require that the gate pattern be scalable. This can imply that the gate pattern must consist of unit cells that can be repeated over and over to create larger arrays. Most of the gate patterns which have been developed thus far do not consist of unit cells, and the gate patterns for double and triple quantum dots do not resemble the gate patterns for single quantum dots. This can make it unclear how to take existing gate patterns and extend (e.g., scale) them to tens or hundreds of quantum dots.",
                        "Thus, it may be beneficial to provide an exemplary semiconductor quantum dot device, which can overcome at least some of the deficiencies described herein above."

The exemplary device can include 12 quantum dots, nine of which can be arranged in a linear array, and three that can be used as sensitive charge detectors. The exemplary device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure can utilize an overlapping metallic gate architecture to facilitate tight electronic confinement (see, e.g., Reference 16), while an undoped heterostructure can provide a clean, high mobility interface (see, e.g., Reference 17) for the formation of well-behaved quantum dots with reproducible characteristics.",
                        "The exemplary gate pattern can be fabricated or otherwise placed on top of a semiconductor substrate (e.g., an undoped silicon/silicon-germanium (\u201cSi/SiGe\u201d) substrate). A cross section of the exemplary substrate 100 is shown in FIG. 1. A pure Si QW layer 110 can be grown on top of a SiGe substrate 105, followed by a SiGe spacer layer 115. A thin Si cap layer 120 can be used to protect the SiGe spacer layer 115 during further processing. Ohmic contacts can be made to the QW using, for example, locally doped regions of the wafer. Various other suitable semiconductor substrates (e.g., quantum well structures) can be used, which can include, for example, silicon dioxide on silicon and/or AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures.",
                        "The exemplary gate pattern (e.g., quantum dot) can include, for example, three conductive (e.g., metallic) layers. Exemplary suitable materials for the conductive layers can include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold, copper and/or polysilicon. The exemplary layers can be composed almost entirely of the respective material (e.g., having a 99.9% purity). Alternatively, the conductive layers can be composed partially of the respective material. Each such layer can be exposed to an oxygen/argon mixture directly, after metallization, in vacuum in order to facilitate an insulating layer (e.g., an oxide layer) to form on the outside of the metal. This exemplary layer of oxide can electrically isolate each layer from further layers of metal. The exemplary gate pattern of the first layer is shown in FIG. 2A. The first layer of metal 205 can operate as a screening layer. Such screening layer can define a single-dimensional channel 210 that can contain the array of quantum dots, as well as adjacent transport channels 215 that can contain charge sensing quantum dots. The exemplary second gate layer 220, which can be on top of or adjacent to the first layer, is shown in FIG. 2B, and can be used to accumulate electrons. These exemplary gates can be held at relatively positive voltages, and can accumulate electrons underneath them through openings 215 in the screening layer. Gate electrodes in each layer can have their own respective voltage (e.g., voltage level) applied therethrough. The exemplary third layer, which can be on top of or adjacent to the second layer, is shown in FIG. 2C, can contain barrier gate electrodes 225 that can be used to tune the barriers between regions of the two-dimensional electron gas (\u201c2DEG\u201d), which can be accumulated by the second layer.",
                        "According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, an exemplary thickness of the conductive layers can be about 200 nm or less (e.g., within 5%-10% of such number). According to addition exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the exemplary thickness of the conductive layers can be about 100 nm (e.g., within 5%-10% of such number)). An exemplary thickness of the insulating layer can be about 10 nm or less (e.g., within 5%-10% of such number)). In further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the exemplary thickness of the insulating layer can be about 4 nm or less (e.g., within 5%-10% of such number)). Various suitable exemplary insulating materials can be used, which can include, for example, silicon oxide, silicon nitride and/or aluminum oxide.",
                        "The second and third layers of the exemplary device according to the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure can have or provide control over regions of the 2DEG, which can be much smaller than their full lithographic dimensions. This can be achieved by screening. Gates in the second layer can likely affect only the 2DEG through the opening in the first layer. This exemplary configuration can reduce the region which they control to x1 by y, as illustrated in the diagram of FIG. 3A. Gates in the third layer can be restricted to even smaller gaps in the first two layers such that the region of the 2DEG, which they have control over, can be x2 by y. By utilizing screening in such exemplary manner, it is possible to provide each gate with a more local control of the confinement potential. Thus, there can be less cross capacitance. This reduced cross capacitance can make it significantly easier to tune the physically relevant parameters of the dot.",
                        "The charge occupation of the exemplary quantum dots can be read out through the adjacent charge sensing quantum dots. The exemplary locations of the dots 305 in the main array, and the sensor dots 310, are illustrated in FIG. 3B. For example, one charge sensor can be placed for every three quantum dots in the main array. The conductance through the charge sensing quantum dots will exhibit Coulomb blockade peaks. By setting the conductance on the side of one of these Coulomb blockade peaks, changes in the charge state of nearby quantum dots in the main array can create a change in the conductance through the charge sensor. From this, it can be possible to track the movement of charge through the main array of quantum dots.",
                        "The exemplary manner in which the number of gates can scale with the number of quantum dots can be considered for the exemplary scaling. For example, each dot in the main array of dots can be defined by one plunger gate and two barrier gates. Each barrier gate can be shared between adjacent dots, except for the first and last dot of the array which each can have a barrier separating it from the reservoirs on either side of the array. Therefore, the number of plunger and barrier gates can scale as 2N+1, with N equal to the number of dots in the array. It can be beneficial that the number of gates, and the length of the array, scale linearly with N. This can ensure that it can be feasible to scale to a large N without needing a fundamental design change above some number of quantum dots.",
                        "This exemplary device described herein can be used to shuttle single electrons through the 2DEG in a controlled manner. This can be achieved by applying a series of timed voltage pules 405 to the gates as illustrated in FIG. 4. For example, the voltage pulses 405 hit each quantum dot consecutively leading to sequential tunneling of the electron through each quantum dot. The ability to shuttle single charges through arrays of quantum dots can be used to move information through a quantum computer.",
                        "Exemplary Linear Gate Architecture",
                        "A false-colored scanning electron microscope (\u201cSEM\u201d) image of the device is shown in FIG. 5A, and a COMSOL simulation of the electron density n in the plane of the quantum well is shown in FIG. 5B. Tight electronic confinement can be achieved, for example, using an overlapping aluminum gate architecture. (See, e.g., Reference 16). As shown in such drawings, in the upper half of the exemplary device, two sets of aluminum gate electrodes, with a pitch of about 100 nm, can be interleaved to form a linear array of 9 quantum dots. A plunger gate can control the chemical potential of each quantum dot 505, while barrier gates can control the tunnel coupling of adjacent dots 510. An aluminum screening layer can restrict the action of the tuning gates to a one-dimensional (\u201c1D\u201d) channel. (See, e.g., Reference 16). High sensitivity single electron charge detection can be achieved using three single dot charge sensors defined in a second one-dimensional channel that can be formed in the lower half of the device 515.",
                        "The scalability of the exemplary device can be illustrated from its repeating unit cell structure. Each exemplary unit cell can consist of three quantum dots and a charge sensor. The exemplary device can be constructed, for example, by concatenating three of these unit cells. Scaling to arrays of arbitrary length can be achieved by adding additional unit cells. The overlapping gate architecture demonstrated here has roughly about 4.5 times the areal density of a widely-used double dot depletion mode gate pattern; 9 dots and 3 charge sensors were fit in an area of \u02dc1.5 \u03bcm2, the same area as a GaAs double quantum dot and its two quantum point contact charge detectors. (See, e.g., Reference 2).",
                        "Exemplary Characterization of the 9 Dot Array",
                        "Scaling to large arrays of quantum dots can benefit from uniform and reliable single quantum dot characteristics. For example, three figures of merit can be used to characterize the reproducibility of the linear array: the lever arm a, charging energy Ec, and orbital excited state energy Eorb. A single quantum dot can be formed under each plunger gate, with the neighboring quantum dots tuned to the many electron regime and extract a, Ec and Eorb for each dot using a combination of transport measurements, charge sensing and pulsed gate spectroscopy.",
                        "Lever arms can be extracted from transport measurements of Coulomb diamonds at the N=0 to 1 transition, where N can refer to the number of electrons in the dot. The charge state of each dot can be read out by measuring the conductance through the nearest single dot charge sensor. As an example, the diagram of FIG. 6A shows the charge stability of a quantum dot formed under plunger gate P9. As shown in FIG. 6A, the derivative of the charge sensor conductance, dgS3/dVp9, can be plotted as a function of Vp9 and VB10. The lack of charge transitions for low values of Vp9 can indicate that dot 9 (e.g., element 605) has been emptied of free electrons, reaching N9=0 charge occupancy. Addition voltages for dot 9 can be extracted along the vertical dashed line 605 shown in FIG. 6A, and converted into addition energies, Eadd, using \u221d. These addition energies are plotted in the graph 610 shown FIG. 6B. For example, the addition energies for dots 4, 6 and 8 (e.g., elements 615, 620 and 625, respectively) are shown in FIG. 6B. The increase in Eadd at the N=4 to 5 charge transition can be attributed to shell filling of the low lying spin and valley degrees of freedom. (See, e.g., References 18 and 19).",
                        "Pulsed gate spectroscopy can be performed in each dot at the N=0 to 1 charge transition in order to extract the orbital excited state energy Eorb. (See, e.g., References 20 and 21). An about 500 Hz square wave, with peak-to-peak amplitude, Vpulse, can be added to the dc plunger gate voltage to repeatedly load and unload an electron onto the dot. For a small Vpulse, only the ground state can be pulled below the Fermi level of the lead (e.g., see diagram 630 shown in FIG. 6C) and an electron tunnels onto the dot with a rate \u0393g. When the pulse amplitude can exceed Vorb, the electron can load into either the ground state or the first excited state (e.g., diagram 635 shown in FIG. 6C). The effective loading rate can be increased due to the contribution from the excited state \u0393e, and can be visible in the charge sensing data. The change in conductance due to the ground state creates the sloped line 640 in FIG. 6(D). The region marked by the blue square 645 in FIG. 6(D) corresponds to the configuration of 630, where only the ground state is pulsed below the Fermi level, while the region marked by the green circle 650 corresponds to the configuration of 635, where both the ground state and excited states are pulsed below the Fermi level. The transition from region 645 to 650 occurs at a voltage Vorb above the ground state line 640. From these data, an orbital excited state energy Eorb=\u03b1Vorb=3.4 me V can be extracted for dot 9.",
                        "Similar characterization can be performed on dots 1-8, and the results are summarized in Table I below. The averaged figures of merit can be \u03b1=0.13\u00b10.01 meV/mV, Ec=6.9\u00b10.7 meV, and Eorb=3.0\u00b10.5 meV. These exemplary charging energies can generally be larger than those obtained with other device designs in Si/SiGe due to the tight confinement potential generated by the overlapping gate architecture. For example, depletion mode devices achieved charging energies of less than about 2 meV (see, e.g., Reference 22), while enhancement mode architectures have yielded charging energies close to about 5 meV. (See, e.g., Reference 19). Moreover, the large orbital excited state energies can be comparable to those measured in GaAs devices, which has an effective mass that can be nearly three times smaller than Si.

                                "In order to characterize the charge sensor performance, the shift in a charge sensor Coulomb blockade peak due to a change in the charge occupancy of a nearby dot in the linear array can be measured. For example, FIG. 7A shows a graph illustrating the conductance through charge sensor 3, gS3, as a function of VP8 and VS3. A Coulomb blockade peak is visible in the sensor dot conductance, and it abruptly shifts each time an electron can be added to quantum dot 8. For example, peak 730 in FIG. 7(B) is plotting the peak taken at the position of a dashed line 705 in FIG. 7(A), and peak 735 in FIG. 7(B) is plotting the peak taken at the position of a dashed line 710 in FIG. 7(A). These two Coulomb blockade peak are on either side of the N8=0 to 1 charge transition. A peak shift of \u0394VS3=0.26 mV at the N8=0 to 1 charge transition can be measured from the displacement of the two peaks 730, 735. The shift in the charge sensor 3 Coulomb blockade peak position can also be measured for dots 2-7, and is plotted in the graph shown in FIG. 7C as a function of the geometric distance, d, between each dot and the sensor dot. The shift can fall off rapidly as 1/d3.",

The impact of this screening can be illustrated using the diagram shown in FIG. 7D. An electron 745 trapped in a quantum dot can induce a positive image 750 charge in the gate metal above. The resulting electric field due to the electron and its image charge can be that of a dipole, which can fall off with a 1/r3 dependence.",

Five time series (e.g., element 805) extracted from this data set are plotted in the graph shown in FIG. 8B. The lowest time-series shown in FIG. 8B was acquired with VP8=661.12 mV. Thus, the exemplary dot can be empty nearly all of the time. With VP8 slightly increased, the current shows signatures of real-time single electron tunneling events, and switches between two levels corresponding to the N8=0 and 1 charge states. The dwell time in the N8=1 charge state increases with increasing VP8. Using a threshold to discriminate between the charge states, the time-averaged occupation of dot 8, <N8>, can be plotted as a function of VP8 in the graph shown in FIG. 8C, which illustrates Data 810 and f(E) 815. The population follows a Fermi function f(E) as the chemical potential of the dot level can be lowered past the Fermi level of the lead.

A one-second time series of the current through the charge sensor with dot 8 tuned to the N8=0 to 1 charge degeneracy point can be measured. The data can be acquired at a sampling rate of about 500 kHz and a Kaiser-Bessel finite impulse response (\u201cFIR\u201d) filter can be used to reduce the effective measurement bandwidth to about 30 kHz. An about 30 ms long segment of this time series is shown in the exemplary graph of FIG. 9A. Real time tunneling events between N8=0 (e.g., element 905) and N8=1 (e.g., element 910) are seen as two level switching in the measured current. A histogram of the full time trace is shown in the graph of FIG. 9B. The two well-resolved peaks correspond to the two charge states. Each peak can be nicely fit to a Gaussian with width \u03c3I=0.112 nA, corresponding to the current noise in the exemplary measurement setup. The centroids of the two Gaussians can be separated by \u0394I=0.772 nA, which can correspond to the signal associated with a change in electron occupancy of one. For these data, a SNR=\u0394I/\u03c3I=6.9 can be extracted. By adjusting the FIR filter cutoff frequency, \u0192, the SNR can be plotted as a function of the effective measurement bandwidth in the graph shown in FIG. 9C, which illustrates that the SNR decreases with increasing \u0192.",

With the gate voltages configured differently, four singlet-triplet qubits can be formed using pairs of electrons (see, e.g., Reference 2) and the qubits can be coupled via a dipole-dipole interaction. Additionally, three exchange-only spin qubits can be defined, facilitating full electrical control over the Bloch sphere of each qubit. (See, e.g., References 26, 35 and 36). To demonstrate the versatility of this exemplary device architecture, a single-shot readout of an electron spin can be shown. Two capacitively-coupled DQD charge qubits can be formed, and an interaction strength of about 200 \u03bceV can be measured, which can provide an about 50 GHz two-qubit gate operation speed.",

A three-step pulse sequence can be employed to measure the spin relaxation time T1 at a magnetic field B=1T. (See, e.g., References 23 and 24). Starting with an empty dot, the chemical potential of the dot level can be plunged below the Fermi level of the lead, which can facilitate an electron to load into either the spin up or the spin down state. After a time twait, the readout phase can begin by setting the chemical potential of the dot such that the spin up and spin down energy levels can straddle the Fermi level of the lead. If the electron on the dot can be in the spin-up excited state, as shown in the diagram of FIG. 10A, the electron can hop off of the dot and be replaced by a spin-down electron. The change in the charge occupancy of the quantum dot due to this process can be visible in time series measurements of the sensor dot current, I, and can be referred to as a \u201cspin bump.\u201d In contrast, if the final spin state can be spin down, no spin bump may be observed. Then, the chemical potential of both spin states can be raised above the Fermi level to empty the dot and complete the measurement cycle.",

T1 can be extracted by varying twait and measuring the probability P\u2191 of being in the spin up state at the end of the measurement phase. (See, e.g., graph of FIG. 10C). Each data point 1015 can represent the average of 10,000 single shot traces. The resulting data can be fit to an exponential decay with a best fit T1=170\u00b117 ms.

Dots 6-7 can be used to define one DQD, and dots 8-9 to define a second DQD. The charge stability diagrams for these DQDs are shown in the graphs of FIGS. 11A and 11B. The barrier gate voltage VB8 can be set such that there may be no tunneling between dots 7 and 8. As a result, the two DQDs can optionally be coupled only via a capacitive interaction Cm. Interdot detuning axes, \u03b5L and \u03b5R, are overlaid on the data in the graphs of FIGS. 11A and 11B.
