    "title": "Enzyme-responsive progelator cyclic peptides for minimally invasive delivery to the heart post-myocardial infarction",
    "date": "2019-04-15",
    "abstract": "Injectable biopolymer hydrogels have gained attention for use as scaffolds to promote cardiac function and prevent negative left ventricular (LV) remodeling post-myocardial infarction (MI). However, most hydrogels tested in preclinical studies are not candidates for minimally invasive catheter delivery due to excess material viscosity, rapid gelation times, and/or concerns regarding hemocompatibility and potential for embolism. We describe a platform technology for progelator materials formulated as sterically constrained cyclic peptides which flow freely for low resistance injection, and rapidly assemble into hydrogels when linearized by disease-associated enzymes. Their utility in vivo is demonstrated by their ability to flow through a syringe and gel at the site of MI in rat models. Additionally, synthetic functionalization enables these materials to flow through a cardiac injection catheter without clogging, without compromising hemocompatibility or cytotoxicity. These studies set the stage for the development of structurally dynamic biomaterials for therapeutic hydrogel delivery to the MI.",

                "Myocardial infarction (MI) accounts for 46% of all deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease1. Within the first few days post MI, an inflammatory response causes cardiomyocyte death and degradation of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) by secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)2. This in turn can lead to aneurysmal thinning and negative left ventricular (LV) remodeling within days to weeks. Left untreated, heart failure results as one of the leading causes of death in the western world.",
                "Injectable hydrogel-based scaffolds have gained attention as a therapeutic approach to prevent negative LV remodeling by utilizing materials to stimulate cardiac repair. Materials for this purpose have included myocardial ECM3, alginate4, and hyaluronic acid hydrogels5, or employing biomaterials as therapeutic delivery scaffolds such as naturally derived polymeric hydrogels (e.g., collagen6, fibrin7, heparin8, and gelatin9), synthetic polymeric hydrogels (e.g., poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)10, ureido-pyrimidinone-modified poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)11, and chitosan12), and microparticles (e.g., poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)13 and dextran14). Despite many successful preclinical studies, wide spread translation and initiation of clinical trials has been slow, with current studies limited to a myocardial ECM hydrogel (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02305602) and alginate (NCT3082508 and NCT01311791). One reason for this lack of translation is that the majority of these hydrogels are not candidates for minimally invasive catheter delivery because of excess material viscosity, their quick gelling nature that can lead to catheter clogging, and concerns regarding hemocompatibility since materials can leak into the bloodstream upon injection into a beating heart15\u201317. One versatile class of materials that has been successfully tested in several preclinical MI models using surgical epicardial injections is self-assembling peptides (SAPs)18\u201321. SAP hydrogels are attractive as they: (1) resemble native ECM, (2) require no additive reagents to induce gelation, (3) are biodegradable, (4) are biocompatible, (5) have pore sizes (~5\u2013200\u2009nm) conducive to promote endothelial cell adhesion and capillary formation, (6) allow rapid cellular migration because of their flexibility, (7) are rehealable, (8) do not suffer from batch-to-batch chemical variability, and (9) are amenable to sequence modification22,23. However, SAPs have not demonstrated amenability to cardiac catheter delivery.",
                "Previously, we demonstrated that soluble peptide\u2013polymer-based nanoparticles can aggregate into macromolecular scaffolds in diseased tissue through the action of endogenously expressed inflammatory-related enzymes, MMPs, providing a viable method for targeted accumulation24, prolonged tissue retention25, and therapeutic delivery26. However, these materials employed a non-biodegradable functionalized polynorbornene backbone and did not possess viscoelastic properties. Inspired by recent efforts with enzyme-responsive peptides27\u201329 and a study by Nilsson and coworkers30 utilizing reductively triggered cyclic peptides as progelators, we focused on developing a cyclic, enzyme-triggered, responsive peptide platform that would enable minimally invasive delivery of SAPs to the heart. Specifically, MMP-2/92,31 and elastase32,33, which are endogenously expressed at the site of MI during the acute inflammatory (days) and fibrotic (weeks) phases, provide a useful handle, playing key roles in the healing process through degradation of ECM and fibrinogen2.",
                "In this work, we engineer cyclic peptide progelators that flow freely in solution until proteolytically activated (Fig.\u00a01). Model SAP sequences are prepared as water-soluble, dispersed cyclic progelators (green rings, Fig.\u00a01a) that contain a substrate recognition sequence for MMP-2/9 and elastase (red) and a handle for fluorescent labeling. We show that enzymatic cleavage of these sterically constrained cyclic progelators results in linearization to generate SAPs (Fig.\u00a01b) which subsequently assemble into rehealable viscoelastic hydrogels (Fig.\u00a01c). Their low viscosity, ability to gel at the site of MI, and hemocompatible nature of the concentrated progelator are demonstrated. In addition, we show that the progelators are amenable to minimally invasive catheter injection using an in vitro model system. This opens the possibility of delivering SAPs to the heart via catheter.Fig. 1Design of cyclic, enzyme-responsive progelator peptides for activatable gelation. a Cyclic progelator peptides, containing gelling sequence (green), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/elastase enzyme cleavage recognition sequence (red), and disulfide bridge (black), resist assembly due to conformational constraint.

                        "SAPs undergo spontaneous assembly through electrostatic and amphiphilic interactions into ordered nanostructures34,35. In many instances, variation of sequence and charge distribution in SAPs can influence properties such as secondary structure36, fiber diameter37, and bulk viscoelasticity38. In our design, we began with a gellable core based on a model SAP consisting of the repeat sequence (KLDL)3 (referred to in this study as KLDL), which has been studied as a non-immunogenic, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial scaffold for tissue engineering applications39\u201341. This peptide self-assembles spontaneously into \u03b2-sheets through cationic and anionic crosslinking of the Lys and Asp residues and hydrophobic interactions along the Leu residues. As a proof of concept for sequence control, we chose to employ an analog of KLDL hypothesized to alter secondary structural assembly and achieve modified gel properties. For this purpose, we designed (KFDF)3 (referred to as KFDF), in which the incorporation of aromatic Phe residues introduce \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. From the KLDL and KFDF SAPs, we engineered a small library of functionalized SAPs and progelators for studying assembly within a biological relevant environment (Fig.\u00a02 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a01\u20133). We first evaluated whether the addition of non-gelling amino acids from the MMP-2/9 recognition sequence (PLG|LAG) and cysteine residues used for macrocyclization into the SAP sequences would interfere with their ability to self-assemble (Fig.\u00a02a). Predictive computational modeling with open-access FibPredictor software42 provided initial evidence that functionalized KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear SAPs would experience a switch in self-assembly orientation from antiparallel to parallel \u03b2-sheets. Regardless, such a design would retain the capacity to form fibrillar bilayers (Fig.\u00a02b, c and Supplementary Tables\u00a01\u20132). Notably in KFDFLinear, Phe residues on each strand are sandwiched with analogous residues on neighboring strands, which facilitate \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and stronger hydrophobic interactions than those of Leu-containing peptides. Indeed, with the design validated in silico, synthetic preparation of the KFDF SAP resulted in materials with increased mechanical strength without sacrificing re-healing capacity, inherent to the known KLDL system43 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04).Fig. 2Sequences and design of self-assembling peptides (SAPs) and cyclic, enzyme-responsive progelators. a Table of SAPs and progelators based on the (KLDL)3 and (KFDF)3 amino acid gelling sequence with corresponding diagrammatical representations (green is progelator sequence, red is recognition sequence, pink is fluorophore). Sequences are shown for the base, unmodified SAPs (KLDL and KFDF) and modified SAPs (KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear) primed for cyclization but lacking fluorescent labels, together with the corresponding cyclized versions (progelators, KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic). In addition, rhodamine-labeled modified SAPs (Rho-KLDLLinear and Rho-KFDFLinear) are shown, together with their corresponding labeled cyclized progelators (Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic).

                        "In practice, modified SAPs KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear, retained the capacity to self-assemble (both experimentally and predicted) despite modest changes in secondary structure and viscoelastic properties (Fig.\u00a03). Experimental circular dichroism (CD) demonstrated that KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear retained \u03b2-sheet conformations (n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0* transition at 215\u2009nm). However, the positive peak at ~200\u2009nm (\u03c0\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0* transition) found in KLDL and KFDF is blue-shifted to ~195\u2009nm, indicative of a parallel to antiparallel orientation switch (Fig.\u00a03a, b)44. Additionally, KFDFLinear reveals a new high energy minimum at 203\u2009nm corresponding to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* effects resulting from aromatic \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions in the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer structure (Fig.\u00a03b)30. This transition is predicted in theoretical spectra from DichroCalc45 for KFDFLinear (202\u2009nm) and not for KLDLLinear, which contains no aromatic residues (Fig.\u00a03c, d). Regardless of altered secondary structure, fiber morphology and bulk viscoelastic properties exhibited minimal changes to that of unmodified KLDL and KFDF (Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h). Slight drops in storage moduli for KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear are attributed to the decreasing molar concentration of amino acids (hydrogels prepared with respect to weight at 15\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121) contributing to \u03b2-sheet formation. Regardless, no significant disruptive effects to gelling capacity, as defined by tan\u03b4\u2009<\u20091 (Fig.\u00a03g, h) or strain tolerance (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), were observed through the introduction of over 66% more amino acid residues to the SAP sequence. This exemplifies the robustness of these linear SAPs to sequence modification and potential capacity to tolerate functional moieties such as fluorescent tags or small molecule drugs.Fig. 3Impact of self-assembling peptide (SAP) functionalization on assembly properties. a Experimental circular dichroism (CD) spectra of KLDL (black dashed line) and KLDLLinear (blue line) SAPs, with labeled minimum at 215\u2009nm (n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0*). b Experimental CD spectra of KFDF (black dashed line) and KFDFLinear (blue line) SAPs, with labeled minima at 215\u2009nm (n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0*) and 203\u2009nm (\u03c0\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0*). c Theoretical CD spectra of KLDL (black dashed line) and KLDLLinear (green line) SAPs from DichroCalc simulations using FibPredictor models. d Theoretical CD spectra of KFDF (black dashed line) and KFDFLinear (green line) SAPs from DichroCalc simulations using FibPredictor models (see Supplementary Tables\u00a03-4).

                        "SAP steric constraint provides a simple and versatile engineering approach for preventing network assembly in a biological environment (Fig.\u00a04). Functionalized SAP analogs containing an Fmoc protecting group or rhodamine dye on the N terminus were cyclized through oxidation of terminal cysteine residues to generate unlabeled and labeled progelators (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013e). Dilute solution phase macrocyclization was complete within 125\u2009min by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LCMS) (Fig.\u00a04f, h). Combined, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), high\u2010resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and tandem-mass spectrometry (MS) confirm synthesis of the cyclic products (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06\u20138). Ultraviolet (UV) spectra confirm the presence of rhodamine absorbance in Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic progelators (Fig.\u00a04g, i). Pure nonviscous progelators (Fig.\u00a04j, k) were formulated with a pH switch from basic to neutral conditions into 1\u00d7 Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), pH 7.4 (10\u2009mM peptide) to minimize aggregation, as determined by light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Supplementary Figs.\u00a09\u201311). Conformational rigidification via macrocyclization is suspected to induce limited oligomerization via intermolecular stacking of cyclic constructs into transient nanotubes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012), as has been reported in the literature46,47. Despite this observed secondary structure, large assemblies were absent by TEM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010c). Thus, our formulated cyclic progelators persist as free-flowing solutions for easy injection in vivo.Fig. 4Facile synthesis of sterically constrained and labeled cyclic progelators. a Synthetic scheme for unlabeled (route I) and labeled (route II) KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic progelators. All self-assembling peptides (SAPs) were cyclized under dilute conditions (500\u2009\u00b5M) with 5 eq I2 in a mixture of AcOH/MeOH/H2O to create a soluble progelator. Route I uses N-terminal Fmoc-protected SAPs to improve material separation during chromatographic purification. Fmoc removal generates the intended unlabeled progelators KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic. Route II depicts the synthesis of labeled progelators through N-terminal modification with 5(6)-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine prior to cyclization. b, c High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (b) monitored at 214\u2009nm and corresponding electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra (c) of Fmoc-KLDLLinear (red), Fmoc-KLDLCyclic (blue), and KLDLCyclic (green) (835.79\u2009m/z, 787.76\u2009m/z, and 1070.26\u2009m/z, respectively) verify purity and mass of synthetic modifications to KLDL peptides. d, e HPLC (d) monitored at 214\u2009nm and corresponding ESI spectra (e) of Fmoc-KFDFLinear (red), Fmoc-KFDFCyclic (blue), and KFDFCyclic (green) (781.862\u2009m/z, 856.17\u2009m/z, and 1355.66\u2009m/z, respectively) verify purity and mass of synthetic modifications to KFDF peptides.

The fibrotic phase (weeks post MI) is notable for residually high MMP concentrations2,31 and elevated sources of elastase from neutrophil extracellular traps, remaining weeks after neutrophil apoptosis 32,33.Fig. 5Enzyme responsiveness of Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic progelators. a\u2013c Analysis of Rho-KLDLCyclic responsiveness to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), elastase, and thermolysin. a Peptide sequence and theoretical enzymatic cuts sites.

                        "Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic were incubated with MMP-9 catalytic domain and porcine elastase to cleave at preferential cut sites (Fig.\u00a05a, d). Enzymatic cleavage by active MMP-9 and elastase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013) induced visible aggregation in reaction vials and entangled fibrous meshes by TEM (Fig.\u00a05b, e), whereas denatured enzymes elicited no response. At the site of MI, the presence of very high MMP and elastase concentrations is expected to induce rapid cleavage, forcing the peptide progelator to assemble and solidify at the target site. However, other inflammation-associated enzymes or constitutively expressed extracellular proteases could play a role in nonspecific degradation. Thus, thermolysin was used to assess general stability of our material to excess proteolysis and subsequent hydrogel disassembly in vivo49. Despite the promiscuous activity of thermolysin, incubation with Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic induced fiber formation by TEM (Fig.\u00a05b, e) and structural rearrangement by CD (Fig.\u00a05c, f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). Potential intramolecular50 and intermolecular51,52 steric hindrance from these labeled progelators might explain differences in the CD cleavage kinetics.

                        "The concept behind our cyclic progelator platform relies on upregulated enzymes to initiate assembly and ultimately viscoelastic gel formation at the site of MI. However, excess proteolysis in vivo from the \u2018soup\u2019 of proteases at the MI may prevent gelation or retention of hydrogels at the site of injury. To simulate this environment, we treated our material at 10\u2009mM with a large quantity of the robust and nonspecific enzyme, thermolysin (Fig.\u00a06). Initially, KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic displayed overlapping storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli, indicative of solutions lacking significant crosslinks or chemical interactions (Fig.\u00a06a). Incubation with thermolysin initiates rapid gelation as G\u2032 diverges from G\u2032\u2032. A steady state at 200\u2009min and continuous measurement of viscoelastic properties revealed no change for up to 3 days in the presence of thermolysin. Tightly entangled macromolecular scaffolds are suspected to confer some degree of resistance to further proteolysis. Furthermore, the resulting gels displayed rapid healing capacity when subjected to repeat cycles of excess strain (100%) (Fig.\u00a06b, c). Morphological changes from rheology samples before and after enzyme incubation are illustrated in Fig.\u00a06d, e. Synthetic product analog SAPs in which the gelator sequence contained flanking substrate residues (KLDLControl and KFDFControl) were used for simple comparison with enzyme-induced gelation (Supplementary Figs.\u00a015-16). Indeed, secondary assembly characteristics (CD), fibril morphology (TEM), and viscoelastic properties (rheology) of KFDFControl match closely to that of enzymatically cleaved KFDFCyclic in Fig.\u00a06. We suspect that the slowed kinetics of gel formation for enzyme-treated KLDLCyclic vs KFDFCyclic is caused by lower specificity of thermolysin for Leu vs Phe at the P1 position53. With hydrogel assembly following close behind, increased proteolytic resistance of tightly packed fibers and limited enzyme diffusion within the porous network54 likely has a restrictive effect on further progelator linearization and subsequent gel stiffening for all samples. Regardless, thermolysin cleavage of either progelator generates linear SAPs through the loss of Leu\u2013Gly\u2013Leu (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017).Fig. 6Bulk scale gelation of unlabeled cyclic progelators. a Time course rheological analyses of KLDLCyclic (left) and KFDFCyclic (right) progelators before and after addition of thermolysin (t\u2009=\u2009~40\u2009min).

                        "To understand the initial stages of self-assembly when progelators first encounter their target protease in vivo, slow step-wise cleavage of KFDFCyclic progelator was achieved through serial additions of dilute thermolysin (Fig.\u00a06f). CD reveals that linearization by enzyme cleavage causes an increase in peptide flexibility, shown by a steep decrease in the signal at 204\u2009nm, and unchanged \u03b2-sheet signal from lateral alignment at 215\u2009nm. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was used as a positive control to represent ideal assemblies of linearized peptides through complete reduction of the disulfide bond (Fig.\u00a06f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a018). By TEM, reduced peptides assemble as tangled fibrils, similarly to enzymatically cleaved peptides (Fig.\u00a06g). Thus, the enzyme-induced gels observed in Fig.\u00a06 are likely forming through the same self-assembly mechanisms predicted with KFDFControl. The rheological and spectroscopic results presented here indicate that our system has potential to tolerate excess proteolytic degradation in vivo."

                        "Minimally invasive injection of hydrogels into the heart is typically performed through transendocardial injections. Unlike direct epicardial injections performed in small animal models, transendocardial delivery requires that material should be able to reside within the catheter for up to hour-long procedures, yet still flow over multiple injections during this time, and finally only form a solid gel once it has entered the tissue17,55. Rapid gelation and/or high viscosity prohibit many injectable hydrogels from being considered for this minimally invasive delivery route. KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic progelators were amenable to cardiac catheter injection (Fig.\u00a07). As shown in Fig.\u00a07a, both unmodified SAPs and cyclic progelators exhibit shear-thinning behavior, but the viscosities for the latter are over 20\u00d7 lower for both KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic. Thus, conformational constraint of \u03b2-sheet forming SAPs was sufficient to disrupt favorable unimer alignment and weakened structural interactions. We reasoned that SAP cyclization would be sufficient to prevent clogging during catheter injection (Fig.\u00a07b).Fig. 7In vitro catheter injection of low-viscosity progelators. a Complex viscosity of KLDLCyclic (blue triangles) and KFDFCyclic (blue circles) progelators reveal >20\u00d7 decrease in comparison to corresponding unmodified KLDL (black triangles) and KFDF (black circles) self-assembling peptides (SAPs). b Schematic illustrating catheter applicability of KLDL and KFDF SAPs vs that of enzyme-responsive KLDLCyclic and KFDFCylic progelators.

                        "To mimic cardiac catheter injection in vivo, both cyclic progelators (2\u2009mol% labeled for visualization) were flowed through the inner nitinol tubing of a 27\u2009G MyoStar transendocardial injection catheter (Fig.\u00a07c). No excess resistance was detected by manual operation following incubation in the catheter loop for 60\u2009min for either peptide. Complex viscosity of cyclic progelators was independent of peptide concentration up to 10\u2009mM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019). In contrast, unmodified KLDL and KFDF SAPs caused immediate catheter clogging. Excess resistance from high viscosity and tendency to rapidly self-assemble during shearing injection could explain why there are no previous reports of SAPs for cardiac catheter delivery. To ensure that the shear forces upon cyclic progelators during injection do not inhibit enzyme activation, peptides were injected through the catheter into a vial containing thermolysin and incubated for 3\u2009h (37\u2009\u00b0C), resulting in hydrogel formation (Fig.\u00a07e and Supplementary Movie\u00a01)."

                        "In vitro and in vivo tests were conducted to assess practical application using SAP cyclic progelators (Fig.\u00a08). Cytotoxicity of both progelators (KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic) and linear SAPs (KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear) were studied with human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) (Fig.\u00a08a, b). Exposure at high concentration (10\u2009mM) for 4\u2009h showed no difference in toxicity for all peptides (Fig.\u00a08a). Exposure at 24 and 48\u2009h showed an increase in metabolic activity for all peptides at each concentration and timepoint comparable to growth media only (Fig.\u00a08b). This suggests that our various peptide modifications were not only cytocompatible but also did not influence cell metabolism and proliferation. We next examined the KFDFCyclic progelator in hemocompatibility studies and assessed in vivo gelation (Fig.\u00a08c\u2013i). Biomaterial leakage is a concern with transendocardial injection since injections are performed into a beating heart56. Therefore, we assessed hemocompatibility of the cyclic progelator to ensure that modification and cyclization of the SAPs would not generate a thrombogenic response. Whole human blood clotting times, hemostasis kinetics, red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis, and pro-thrombotic profiles were evaluated in the presence of increasing cyclic peptide progelator concentrations in blood. Activated clotting times (ACT) were used as a standard method57 that encompasses intrinsic and common coagulation pathways to assess thrombogenicity. Furthermore, as this method is influenced by increased sample viscosity due to clot formation, potential peptide cleavage by blood proteases and resulting self-assembly would decrease clotting times. No adverse effects were observed for up to 1:10 peptide/blood concentrations (Fig.\u00a08c and Supplementary Table\u00a05). In contrast, collagen showed a significant clot time reduction, and chelation of calcium prevented clotting altogether. Whole blood clotting kinetics were also measured in the absence of an activator to monitor the influence of progelator on hemostasis. Similarly, no statistical difference in clotting was observed between the vehicle and the highest progelator concentration (1:10) at any timepoint (Fig.\u00a08d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a021). In contrast, collagen and glass controls increased the clot rate.Fig. 8Cell viability, hemocompatibility, and in vivo analysis. a Acute and b prolonged cytotoxicity of KLDLCyclic, KFDFCyclic, KLDLLinear, and KFDFLinear in human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). a Percent cell viability after peptide (10\u2009mM) incubation for 4\u2009h (n\u2009=\u20098\u201312 repeats in duplicate). b Fold increase (I/Io) over baseline of CPC viability after incubation for 24 and 48\u2009h with 0, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000\u2009\u00b5M peptide (n\u2009=\u20093 repeats in quadruplicate). c\u2013f Hemocompatibility of progelator (shades of green, 1:20,000, 1:10,000, 1:5000, 1:1000, 1:500, 1:100, and 1:10 blood volume dilution of injected dosage) in human blood with positive (collagen, glass coverslip, and 1% Triton X-100), negative (no calcium), and vehicle (1\u00d7 Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)) controls (blue, gray, and black, respectively). c Activated clotting times (ACT).

Histological and fluorescence analysis of heart sections revealed hydrogel assembly occurred at the site of MI in all rats (Fig.\u00a08h, i). No differences were observed in cardiomyocyte apoptosis or macrophage infiltration (Supplementary Figs.\u00a024-25) between saline- and peptide-injected infarcts at 24\u2009h post injection, suggesting that the activation and subsequent gelation of enzyme-responsive progelators did not increase the infarct inflammatory response."

                "The number of candidate biomaterials amenable to minimally invasive cardiac catheter delivery to the heart post MI is limited. Consequently, translation of promising scaffolds from preclinical to clinical trials has been rare. In this study, we examined a platform modification strategy to enable one promising class of hydrogels, SAPs, to be injectable via a cardiac injection catheter by conformationally constraining linear SAPs into macrocyclic progelators which resist self-assembly (Fig.\u00a01). These progelators were further modified with a substrate recognition sequence for endogenously expressed MI-associated proteases. We took the approach of designing peptide sequences based on a known SAP, and then utilizing in silico modeling to provide preliminary insight into any modifications that may cause disruption of gelation (Fig.\u00a02). These modified sequences were then prepared synthetically for testing. Subsequent experimental analysis of self-assembly characteristics and mechanical properties agreed well with these predictions, namely that sequence modifications did not interfere with self-assembly as \u03b2-sheets into fibrils and viscoelastic hydrogels (Fig.\u00a03). It is hypothesized that any number of other SAP sequences used in biomedical applications could similarly be adapted to our structurally dynamic platform59,60.",
                "The versatility of our platform is demonstrated through the functionalization of two different SAPs sequences, which exhibit disparate self-assembly mechanisms, and yet form progelators with identical responsiveness. Cyclic progelators synthesized in Fig.\u00a04 lacked the capacity to gel when sterically constrained. However, they exhibited responsiveness to enzymes that are inherently active in the MI during both the acute inflammatory phase and fibrotic phase (Fig.\u00a05). Despite the different cut sites recognized by MMP-9 catalytic domain, elastase, and thermolysin, similar secondary structure and nanoscale morphology changes were observed. Bulk cleavage of these sterically constrained materials resulted in healable viscoelastic hydrogels that were stable against excess proteolysis (Fig.\u00a06).",
                "The development of smart structurally dynamic and responsive materials for tissue engineering post MI is a relatively untapped field. With many scaffolds, the common issue remains that chemical modification (e.g., crosslinks, binding moieties, targeting motifs, or therapeutics drugs) can negatively impact material properties such as sample viscosity and gelation kinetics, which would preclude their use in catheters61. With our design, mechanical differences (e.g., stiffness or healing kinetics) in the resulting hydrogel would not affect the initial progelator formulation. Importantly, we provide a demonstration of low-viscosity peptide-based progelators for use in a cardiac injection catheter with little resistance to flow (Fig.\u00a07). The results of these experiments demonstrate that the cyclic progelator acts as a non-Newtonian fluid for smooth catheter-based injection and still retains the capacity to solidify when acted upon by endogenously expressed inflammatory enzymes in the heart, suggesting this could provide a useful strategy for cardiac catheter delivery in vivo. While two types of materials have been delivered via catheter to the heart in clinical trials, namely alginate and a myocardial ECM hydrogel, our approach could have some unique advantages since it is a synthetic system that can be precisely tuned, is well defined, and has limited batch-to-batch variation.",
                "With the potential for tissue leakage into the bloodstream, thrombogenicity and toxicity of transendocardially injected biomaterials is a concern. Synthetic modifications to the SAPs were shown to imbue no cytotoxicity to human CPCs and were hemocompatible and non-thrombogenic through a comprehensive assessment of whole blood clotting times, hemostatic kinetics, RBC hemolysis, and pro-thrombotic assays (Fig.\u00a08). A dosing analysis shows no statistically significant difference in hemostasis due to increasing progelator concentration in whole blood. The extent of coagulation in PPP was only altered at the highest peptide dose which indicates that local high concentrations of peptide have an minor anti-coagulative effect on the intrinsic coagulation (contact-based) pathway; furthermore, the impact that our peptide does have on coagulation was shown to be independent of platelet-dependent thrombus formation, a key player in the pathogenesis of acute MI62. This conclusion is supported by the lack of change in pro-thrombotic profiles when incubated with collagen, which increases clotting rates only through the activation of platelet aggregation63. Given a \u2018standard' clinical concentration of 1:10,00056, which assumes that no material was injected into the heart wall and instead escaped into the bloodstream, we observed no adverse effects on coagulation at this clinically relevant dose. These results indicate that this platform for generating an inert cyclic adduct of known SAPs should not result in unwanted blood interactions during delivery. Our platform enables facile delivery of a free-flowing progelator, and on-demand gelation at the site of inflammation (Fig.\u00a08). In vivo analysis of KFDFCyclic progelator revealed successful gelation of activated hydrogel scaffolds in a rat MI model, without inducing an inflammatory response or cardiomyocyte apoptosis. As such, we have demonstrated a simplistic strategy that uses the naturally complex MI microenvironment for delivery and smart assembly in tissue. This proof-of-concept test paves the way for exploring the amenability of various other SAP systems (e.g., RAD16-II) with our progelator system for cardiac injection in vivo. Additionally, there exists the potential to use this platform in conjunction with various therapeutics. Herein, we observed that covalent conjugation of a rhodamine dye to cyclic progelators did not disrupt gelation. We envision a modular system to deliver and sustain any number of covalently bound therapeutics (e.g., small molecule drugs or short peptides). For larger therapeutics (e.g., cell therapies or growth factors), injecting a mixture with the cyclic progelators and subsequent encapsulation within locally activated networks might provide a means for targeted delivery without the need for complex synthetic chemistries. Ultimately, our simple strategy for structural control of self-assembling peptides could be employed for minimally invasive delivery of promising therapeutic peptides to other forms of injury or disease where MMPs are upregulated, including osteoarthritis64, cartilage tissue repair41, nerve damage65, and acute brain injury 66."

                        "FibPredictor was utilized as a commercially available software for generating native-like amyloid fibril structures42. This software was chosen for our study due to its unique ability to reliably model all classes of amyloid fibrils starting from sequence-only input. The algorithm combines \u03b2-sheet model building, \u03b2-sheet replication, and symmetry operations with side-chain prediction and statistical scoring functions for computational predictions on amyloid fibril structures of self-assembling peptides utilized in this study. From each random model generated, a SCRWL internal scoring function was used by SCWRL4 to predict the energetically lowest side-chain orientations. This scoring function was used to calculate the minimal total energy of the entire model and output coordinates for the structure as a PDB file (see\u00a0Supplementary Data) with predicted side chains using the same residue numbering and chain identifiers as the input structure. To identify the most energetically favorable candidate structures in the ensemble, both Amb_3b (computationally more efficient)67 and GOAP (more accurate)68 statistical scoring functions were used to calculate total energies of the protein structure. Reported energies are unitless as they are empirically derived scores, and thus it is not advisable to interpret results as kcal\u2009mol\u22121. Normalized GOAP scores are useful for comparing fibrils of different sizes. Three generations of modeling were performed with literature-recommended parameters shown in Supplementary Table\u00a01. Results of top model for each peptide sequence from the third-generation analysis are reported in Supplementary Table\u00a02. Corresponding structures and raw PDB files are provided in the main text Fig.\u00a02 and as\u00a0Supplementary Data.

                        "Material acute cytotoxicity was tested using human CPCs. The cells were stained with calcein-AM cell viability dye (25\u2009nm; eBioscience) for 30\u2009min and 500,000 cells were resuspended in 50\u2009\u00b5L of each peptide (10\u2009mM). After 15\u2009min, 1\u2009mL of growth media was added to the peptide-cell mixture and 50\u2009\u00b5L was transferred into a 24-well plate for imaging. Five to six images were taken per condition using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Dublin, CA, USA). Cells resuspended in media only were used as a control. The percentage of viable cells was determined by counting the stained cells over the total number of cells. Three experiments were performed (n\u2009=\u20098\u201312 repeats in duplicate). Alternatively, CPCs were also cultured up to 4 days with or without peptides, and cytotoxicity was evaluated by an Alamar blue metabolic activity assay. In all, 3500 hCPCs were plated into each well of a 96-well plate in growth media. At 24\u2009h after cell seeding, baseline metabolic activity was taken by incubating the cells in Alamar blue (1:10 in medium, Invitrogen) for 3\u2009h and analyzing at 550/585\u2009nm with a Synergy\u2122 4 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek). Peptide was added to cells and cultured for 4 days. Alamar blue assay was repeated after 24 and 96\u2009h, and growth media was used as control (n\u2009=\u20093 repeats in quadruplicate). Metabolic activity reported as fold increase vs baseline values."

Two-way ANOVA tests without matching were used for multiple comparisons of the mean in each group at each timepoint with that of the standard. Holm\u2013Sidak test was used for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as follows: ns (p\u2009>\u20090.05), *p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05, **p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01, ***p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001, and ****p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001."
