                        "Myocardial infarction (MI) accounts for 46% of all deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease.1 Within the first few days post-MI, an inflammatory response causes cardiomyocyte death and degradation of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) by secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).2 This in turn can lead to aneurysmal thinning and negative left ventricular (LV) remodeling within days to weeks. Left untreated, heart failure results as one of the leading causes of death in the western world.",
                        "Injectable hydrogel-based scaffolds have gained attention as a therapeutic approach to prevent negative LV remodeling by utilizing materials to stimulate cardiac repair. Materials for this purpose have included myocardial ECM,3 alginate,4 and hyaluronic acid hydrogels,5 or employing biomaterials as therapeutic delivery scaffolds such as naturally derived polymeric hydrogels (e.g. collagen,6 fibrin,7 heparin,8 and gelatin9), synthetic polymeric hydrogels (e.g. PNIPAAm,10 ureido-pyrimidinone-modified PEG,11 and chitosan12) and microparticles (e.g. PLGA13 and dextran14). Despite many successful preclinical studies, wide spread translation and initiation of clinical trials has been slow, with current studies limited to a myocardial ECM hydrogel (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02305602) and alginate (NCT01226563 and NCT01311791). One reason for this lack of translation is that the majority of these hydrogels are not candidates for minimally invasive catheter delivery because of excess material viscosity, their quick gelling nature that can lead to catheter clogging, and concerns regarding hemocompatibility since materials can leak into the blood stream upon injection into a beating heart.15-17",
                        "One versatile class of materials that has been successfully tested in several preclinical MI models using surgical epicardial injections is self-assembling peptides (SAPs).18-21 SAP hydrogels are attractive as they: (1) resemble native ECM, (2) require no additive reagents to induce gelation, (3) are biodegradable, (4) are biocompatible, (5) have pore sizes (\u02dc5-200 nm) conducive to promote endothelial cell adhesion and capillary formation, (6) allow rapid cellular migration because of their flexibility, (7) are rehealable, (8) do not suffer from batch-to-batch chemical variability, and (9) are amenable to sequence modification.22,23 However, SAPs have not been demonstrated as being amenable to cardiac injection catheter delivery. Other researchers have considered efforts with enzyme-responsive peptides24-26 and a study by Nilsson and coworkers utilizing reductively triggered cyclic peptides as progelators27 but the art has not provided cyclic, enzyme triggered, responsive peptide platform that enables minimally invasive delivery of self assembling peptides to the heart. It was previously demonstrated that peptide-polymer based nanoparticles can aggregate into macromolecular scaffolds in diseased tissue through the action of endogenously expressed inflammatory-related enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), providing a viable method for targeted accumulation,28 prolonged tissue retention,29 and therapeutic delivery.30 However, these materials employed a non-biodegradable functionalized polynorbornene backbone and did not possess viscoelastic properties."

In some instances, the composition further comprises a therapeutic agent, and as such is configured as a drug delivery vehicle.",
                        "Enzyme-induced peptide assembly provides a sensitive method for minimally invasive delivery of scaffolding materials to the site of acute MI. Geling peptides bearing a substrate recognition sequence for the inflammatory-related enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and elastase, were cyclized via disulfide bonds to create a water-soluble pro-gelator. When enzymatically cleaved, sterically constrained cyclic peptides linearize and self-assemble via beta-sheets into hydrogels, as shown by TEM, rheometry, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Furthermore, incorporation of functional ligands and enzyme-responsive amino acids does not disrupt hydrogel assembly. Concentrated peptide solutions in saline were shown to be readily injectable via catheter delivery, representing the first example of a peptide-based gelator for delivery to the MI. Finally, enzyme activation of these materials results in hydrogels that exhibit repeated and rapid healing following excess shear strain. The invention provides compositions and methods for therapeutic hydrogel delivery to acute MI."

Upon linearization through peptide cleavage by enzymes upregulated at the site of MI, rapid self-assembly creates a macromolecular network (millimeter scale) which traps itself into the tissue it is activated and enhances tissue retention over that of unimers or nano-scale materials. These biomaterials act to viscoelasatically mimick and supplement the supportive native extracellular matrix (ECM) that MMP-2/9 degrade following myocardial infarction. Supplementation of the degradaded ECM with a synthetic biopolymer pro-gelator enables targeted accumulation of a viscoelastic network and minimally invasive delivery to heart tissue post-MI.",
                                "Low viscosity makes this material not only injectable, but amenable to tranendocardial catheterization and catheter-based coronary infusion, a characteristic which has only been demonstrated with three other materials: decellularized myocardial ECM hydrogel, aliginate hydrogel, and oxime cross-linked hydrogel. This allows for minimally invasive and local delivery to the heart tissue. In contrast, known promising hydrogel-based biomaterials require invasive delivery as a patch or direct epicardial injection into compromised tissue, a quality that is not feasible for clinical application.",
                                "As coronary infusion of the prior art is known to be limited by inefficient spreading, materials which are amenable to catheterization may still not reach their intended target (infarct). Additionally, the risk of embolization is a current concern due to the propensity for injected materials to leak into the LV chamber with transendocaridal catheterization. The material of the invention is inert in the cyclic confirmation and only gels when linearized, thus making these peptides selective to areas with excess inflammation where protease activity is upregulated, in particular, that of MMP-2/9. Furthermore, the material resists gelation in serum and healthy myocardial tissue. This prevents off-target accumulation and reduces the risk of potential geling in the blood stream.",
                                "In contrast to covalently crosslinked hydrogels in preclinical studies, these materials exhibit repeat healing properties (useful in an organ constantly in motion) and rheological stiffnesses similar to that found in native ECM.",
                                "As the ECM is an important hydrogel network in tissue, providing structural support and a niche for biochemical signaling and cellular infiltration, biomaterial hydrogels are being used as ECM mimicks in the wake of enzymatic degradation post-MI. Currently, there are no clinically approved hydrogel based materials for treating MI, primarily due to delivery and formulation limitations stated above. However, clinical trials using aliginate (phase II) and decellularized myocardial ECM hydrogel (phase I) delivered via catheter-based intracoronary infusion and transendocaridal catheter delivery, respectively, are currently underway.",
                                "There are currently no known stimuli responsive or catheter deliverable peptide-based formulations reported in pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies with RAD16-II peptide nanofibers have only utilized direct epicardial injection either as formulations with scaffold itself or in conjunction with stem cells and growth factors (VEGF). Thus only invasive delivery techniques are being explored with peptide-based systems, potentially due to excess viscosity of the scaffold formulations.",
                                "In embodiments, these peptides are primarily composed of an amphipathic peptide sequence characterized by three repeats of Lys-Phe-Asp-Phe (SEQ ID NO:1), (KFDF)3 (SEQ ID NO:4), or more, which self assemble by stacking as beta-sheets through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The macromolecular hydrogel it forms is porous, elastic, and rehealable upon disruption, similar to native ECM. Modification of this gelator sequence with a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 cleavable sequence (e.g., PLGLAG (SEQ ID NO:2)) enables infarct-specific activation. Macrocyclization through covalent disulfide bonds on N- and C-terminal cysteine residues sterically constrains the peptide, preventing beta-sheet assembly as a hydrogel, thus affording a pro-gelator.",
                                "Further, in embodiments, this material is highly modular, in that small molecules (e.g. dyes, contrast agents, and drugs) can easily be incorporated on the N-terminal amine and used in mixed formulations of tagged and untagged peptide (in vitro enzyme cleavage using 100% rhodamine labeled peptide, and in vivo studies using 5% rhodamine labeling). Together, these modifications provide a novel way of delivering biosynthetic tissue scaffolds to diseased tissue in a minimally invasive (catheterization) and targeted (enzyme-responsive) manner."

                        "In embodiments, the invention provides compositions and methods of use comprising a cyclic peptide progelator that flows freely in solution and resists assembly into hydrogel until acted upon by an endogenous signal (FIGS. 1a-1c), namely MMP-2/92,31 and elastase,32,33 which are expressed at the site of MI during the acute inflammatory (days) and fibrotic (weeks) phases. These enzymes play key roles in the healing process through degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibrinogen.2",
                        "SAP sequences were prepared as water soluble, dispersed cyclic progelators (FIG. 1a) that contain a substrate recognition sequence for MMP-2/9 and elastase (red). Two different cyclic progelators were prepared; one without a fluorescent label and one with a rhodamine label (pink ellipse) located adjacent to the substrate sequence. The data shows that enzymatic cleavage of these sterically constrained cyclic progelators results in linearization to generate SAPs (FIG. 1b) which subsequently assemble into rehealable viscoelastic hydrogels (FIG. 1c). Their low viscosity, ability to gel at the site of MI, and hemocompatible nature of the concentrated progelator are demonstrated. In addition, the data shows that the progelators are amenable to minimally invasive catheter injection using an in vitro model system. This enables the delivery of SAPs to the heart via catheter.",
                        "Design of stimuli-responsive SAPs for activatable gelation in vivo. SAPs undergo spontaneous assembly through electrostatic and amphiphilic interactions into ordered nanostructures.34,35 In many instances, variation of sequence and charge distribution in SAPs can influence properties such as secondary structure,36 fiber diameter,37 and bulk viscoelasticity38. The present invention began with a gellable core based on a SAP consisting of the repeat sequence (KLDL)3 (SEQ ID NO:3) (referred to in this study as KLDL), which has been studied as a non-immunogenic, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial scaffold for tissue engineering applications.39-41 This peptide self-assembles spontaneously into \u03b2-sheets through cationic and anionic crosslinking of the Lys and Asp residues and hydrophobic interactions along the Leu residues. As a proof-of-concept for sequence control, an analogue of KLDL was chosen to alter secondary structural assembly and achieve modified gel properties. For this purpose, (KFDF)3 (SEQ ID NO:4) (referred to as KFDF) was designed, in which the incorporation of aromatic Phe residues introduce \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. From the KLDL and KFDF SAPs, a small library of functionalized SAPs and progelators was engineered for studying assembly within a biological relevant environment (FIGS. 2a-2c and FIGS. 9a-11). We first evaluated whether the addition of non-gelling amino acids from the MMP-2/9 recognition sequence (PLG|LAG) (SEQ ID NO:2) and cysteine residues used for macrocyclization into the SAP sequences would interfere with their ability to self-assemble (FIG. 2a). Predictive computational modeling with open-access FibPredictor software42 provided initial evidence that functionalized KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear SAPs would experience a switch in self-assembly orientation from antiparallel to parallel \u03b2-sheets. Regardless, such a design would retain the capacity to form fibrillar bilayers (FIGS. 2b-c and Tables 1-2). Notably in KFDFLinear, Phe residues on each strand are sandwiched with analogous residues on neighboring strands, which facilitate \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and stronger hydrophobic interactions than those of Leu-containing peptides. Indeed, with the design validated in silico, synthetic preparation of the KFDF SAP resulted in materials with increased mechanical strength without sacrificing re-healing capacity or fibrous morphology, inherent to the known KLDL system43 (FIGS. 12a-12d).",
                        "In practice, modified SAPs capable of going on to form the cyclic progelators, namely KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear, retained the capacity to self-assemble (both experimentally and predicted) despite modest changes in secondary structure and viscoelastic properties (FIGS. 3a-3h). Experimental CD demonstrated that KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear retained \u03b2-sheet conformations (n\u2192\u03c0* transition at 215 nm). However, the positive peak at \u02dc200 nm (\u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition) found in KLDL and KFDF is blue-shifted to \u02dc195 nm, indicative of a parallel to antiparallel orientation switch (FIG. 3a-3b).44 Additionally, KFDFLinear reveals a new high energy minimum at 203 nm corresponding to \u03c0-\u03c0* effects resulting from aromatic \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions in the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer structure (FIG. 3b).27 This transition is predicted in theoretical spectra from DichroCalc45 for KFDFLinear (202 nm) and not for KLDLLinear, which contains no aromatic residues. (FIG. 3c-3d). Regardless of altered secondary structure, fiber morphology and bulk viscoelastic properties exhibited minimal changes to that of unmodified KLDL and KFDF (FIG. 3e-3h). Slight drops in storage moduli for KLDLLinear and KFDFLinear are attributed to the decreasing molar concentration of amino acids (hydrogels prepared with respect to weight at 15 mg/mL) contributing to \u03b2-sheet formation. Regardless, no significant disruptive effects to gelling capacity, as defined by tan \u03b4<1 (FIG. 3g-3h) or strain tolerance (FIGS. 13a-13f) were observed through the introduction of over 66% more amino acid residues to the SAP sequence. This exemplifies the robustness of these linear SAPs to sequence modification and potential capacity to tolerate functional moieties such as fluorescent tags or small molecule drugs.",
                        "Cyclization and progelator formulation. SAP steric constraint provides a simple and versatile engineering approach for preventing network assembly in a biological environment (FIGS. 4a-4k). Functionalized SAP analogues containing an Fmoc protecting group or rhodamine dye on the N-terminus were cyclized through oxidation of terminal cysteine residues to generate unlabeled and labeled progelators (FIG. 4a). Fmoc was temporarily used for unlabeled progelators to improve peak separation during purification and to monitor cyclization by HPLC and ESI (FIG. 4b-4e). Dilute solution phase macrocyclization was complete within 125 min by LCMS (FIG. 4f,4h). Combined, MALDI, HRMS and Tandem-MS confirm synthesis of the cyclic products (FIGS. 14a-16d and Tables 3-4). UV spectra confirm the presence of rhodamine absorbance in Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic progelators (FIG. 4g,4i). Nonviscous progelators (FIG. 4j-4k) were dialyzed into milliQ H2O, sterile filtered (0.2 \u03bcm PES), and lyophilized for storage prior to use in vitro and in vivo. To ensure synthetic reproducibility and appropriate biological analysis in this study, our cyclic progelators were structurally characterized and formulated by first dissolving in aqueous solution under basic conditions, followed by neutralization to give final solutions in 1\u00d7DPBS, pH 7.4 (10 mM peptide). This formulation was determined by searching for conditions that minimized aggregation in different solvents and pH values as determined by light scattering and TEM (FIGS. 17a-18). Conformational rigidification via macrocyclization is suspected to have induced limited oligomerization via intermolecular stacking of cyclic constructs into transient nanotubes (FIG. 19), as has been reported in the literature.46-48 Despite these observed secondary structural characteristics, large structures were absent by TEM (FIGS. 18a-18e). Thus, our formulated cyclic progelators persist as free-flowing solutions for easy injection in vivo.",
                        "Cyclic progelators are responsive to inflammation associated enzymes. Labeled cyclic peptide progelators were tested for their responsiveness to inflammatory-related proteases overexpressed post-MI (FIGS. 5a-5f). The initial inflammatory response is marked by the recruitment of abundant neutrophils, which contribute to the release of proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and elastase in the first days post-MI.31,49 The fibrotic phase (weeks post-MI) is notable for residually high MMP concentrations2,31 and elevated sources of elastase from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), remaining weeks after neutrophil apoptosis.32,33Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic were incubated with MMP-9 catalytic domain and porcine elastase to cleave at preferential cut sites (FIGS. 5a,5d). Enzymatic cleavage by active MMP-9 and elastase (FIGS. 20a-20d) induced visible aggregation in the reaction vial and entangled fibrous meshes by TEM, whereas denatured enzymes elicited no response (FIGS. 5b,5e). At the site of MI, the presence of very high MMP and elastase concentrations is expected to induce rapid cleavage, forcing the peptide progelator to assemble and solidify at the target site. However, other inflammation-associated enzymes or constitutively expressed extracellular proteases could play a role in nonspecific degradation. Thus, thermolysin was used as a robust nonspecific enzyme to assess general stability of our material to excess proteolysis and subsequent hydrogel disassembly in vivo.50 Despite the promiscuous activity of thermolysin, incubation with Rho-KLDLCyclic and Rho-KFDFCyclic induced fiber formation by TEM (FIGS. 5b,5e). CD revealed structural rearrangements during this linearization process (FIGS. 5c,5f and FIGS. 21a-21b). The similar responsiveness of both unlabeled progelators to inflammatory enzymes and resistance to dissolution by thermolysin demonstrate the versatility of our conformational control strategy.",
                        "Progelators assemble as viscoelastic and rehealable hydrogels despite robust proteolysis. The concept behind our cyclic peptide progelators is that upregulated enzymes will initiate assembly and ultimately viscoelastic gel formation at the site of MI. However, this location contains a soup of robust proteases involved in the degradation of peptides and proteins. Thus, excess proteolysis in vivo may prevent gelation or retention of hydrogels at the site of MI. To simulate this environment, we treated our material with a large quantity of the robust and non-specific enzyme, thermolysin. Hydrogel assembly kinetics and resulting mechanical properties were then measured rheologically (FIGS. 6a-6g). Initially, KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic progelators formulated as non-viscous liquids displayed overlapping G\u2032 and G\u2033, indicative of free-flowing solutions lacking significant crosslinks or chemical interactions (FIG. 6a). Upon incubation with thermolysin, a gradual increase in G\u2032 and divergence from G\u2033 shows the formation of viscoelastic hydrogels. A steady state was reached at 200 min and continuous measurement of both shear moduli revealed no change for up to 3 days in the presence of thermolysin. The tightly entangled macromolecular scaffolds are suspected to confer some degree of resistance to further proteolysis. Furthermore, the resulting gels displayed rapid healing capacity when subjected to repeat cycles of excess strain (100%) (FIG. 6b-6c). Resulting bulk scale hydrogels and dilute TEM images of fiber assemblies from the rheometer are depicted in FIG. 6d-6e. Synthetic product analogue SAPs in which the gelator sequence contained flanking substrate residues (KLDLControl and KFDFControl) were used for simple comparison with enzyme-induced gelation (FIGS. 22a-22e). Indeed, secondary assembly characteristics (CD), fibril morphology (TEM), and viscoelastic properties (rheology) of KFDFControl match closely to that of enzymatically cleaved KFDFCyclic in FIGS. 6a-6g. However, KLDLControl SAP produced a viscoelastically stronger gel than that demonstrated by KLDLCyclic following enzyme directed linearization.",
                        "To understand the initial stages of self-assembly when progelators first encounter their target protease in vivo, slow step-wise cleavage of KFDFCyclic progelator was achieved through serial additions of dilute thermolysin (FIG. 6f). CD reveals that linearization by enzyme cleavage causes an increase in peptide flexibility, shown by a steep decrease in the signal at 204 nm, and unchanged \u03b2-sheet signal from lateral alignment at 215 nm. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was used as a positive control to represent ideal assemblies of linearized peptides through complete reduction of the disulfide bond (FIG. 6f and FIGS. 23a-23b). By TEM, reduced peptides assemble as tangled fibrils, similarly to enzymatically cleaved peptides (FIG. 6g). Thus, the enzyme-induced gels observed in FIGS. 6a-6g are likely forming through the same self-assembly mechanisms predicted with KFDFControl. The rheological and spectroscopic results presented here indicate that our system has to potential to tolerate excess proteolytic degradation in vivo.",
                        "Catheter compatibility of cyclic peptide progelators. Minimally invasive injection of hydrogels into the heart is typically performed through transendocardial injections. Unlike direct epicardial injections performed in small animal models, transendocardial delivery has certain constraints that are not amenable to most hydrogel systems, namely materials should be able to reside within the catheter during an up to hour long procedure, yet still be injectable over multiple injections during this time, and finally only form a solid gel once it has entered the tissue.17,51 Rapid gelation and/or high viscosity prohibit many injectable hydrogels from being considered for this minimally invasive delivery route. KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic progelators were amenable to cardiac catheter injection (FIGS. 7a-7d). As shown in FIG. 7a, both unmodified SAPs and cyclic progelators exhibit shear-thinning behavior, but the viscosities for the latter are over 20\u00d7lower for both KLDLCyclic and KFDFCyclic. Thus, conformational constraint of \u03b2-sheet forming SAPs was sufficient to disrupt favorable unimer alignment and weakened structural interactions. We reasoned that SAP cyclization would be sufficient to prevent clogging during catheter injection (FIG. 7b).",
                        "To mimic injection of the cyclic progelators through a cardiac injection catheter in vivo, both (2 mol % labeled for visualization) were flowed through the inner nitinol tubing of a 27G (0.21 mm inner diameter) MyoStar transendocardial injection catheter at 37\u00b0 C. using a syringe pump (FIG. 7c). No excess resistance was detected by manual operation following incubation of cyclic progelator within the catheter loop for 60 min for either peptide. In contrast, unmodified KLDL and KFDF SAPs caused immediate catheter clogging. Excess resistance from high viscosity and tendency to rapidly self-assemble during shearing injection could explain why there are no previous reports of SAPs for cardiac catheter delivery. To ensure that the shear forces the cyclic progelator are exposed to during catheter injection do not inhibit enzyme activation and prevent gelation in vivo, the cyclic peptides were injected through the catheter into a vial containing thermolysin and incubated for 3 hr (37\u00b0 C.), resulting in hydrogel formation (FIG. 7e).",
                        "Hemocompatibility and intramyocardial injections in a rat myocardial infarction model. For proof-of-concept analyses in biological systems, we examined the KFDFCyclic progelator in hemocompatibility studies and assessed in vivo gelation (FIGS. 8a-8g). Biomaterial leakage is a concern with transendocardial injection since injections are performed into a beating heart.52 Therefore, we assessed hemocompatibility of the cyclic progelator to ensure that modification and cyclization of the SAPs would not generate a thrombogenic response. Whole human blood clotting times, hemostasis kinetics, red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis, and pro-thrombotic profiles were evaluated in the presence of increasing cyclic peptide progelators concentrations in blood. Activated clotting times (ACT) were used as a standard method53 that encompasses intrinsic and common coagulation pathways to assess thrombogenicity. Furthermore, as this method is influenced by increased sample viscosity due to clot formation, potential peptide cleavage by blood proteases and resulting self-assembly would decrease clotting times. No adverse effects were observed for up to 1:10 peptide:blood concentrations (FIG. 8a and Table 5). In contrast, collagen showed a significant clot time reduction, and chelation of calcium prevented clotting altogether. Whole blood clotting kinetics were also measured in the absence of an activator to monitor the influence of progelator on hemostasis. Similarly, no statistical difference in clotting was observed between the vehicle and the highest progelator concentration (1:10) at any timepoint (FIG. 8b and FIG. 25). In contrast, collagen and glass controls increased the clot rate.",
                        "Red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis in the presence of progelator was used to assess acute toxicity (FIG. 8c and Table 6). Doses up to 1:10 revealed <5% hemolysis, which is below the limit for consideration as a nonhemolytic biomaterial.54 Finally, a pro-thrombotic assay using platelet poor plasma (PPP) was used to monitor non-platelet and phospholipid-specific effects on blood (FIG. 8d), such as potential to inhibit thrombin activity, prevent crosslinking of fibrinogen, or sequestration of calcium for decreased platelet activation. This assay has the advantage of monitoring the intrinsic pathway only, which is useful for studying surface contact activation in blood-biomaterial interactions. The onset of coagulation is indicated by a steep rise in the absorbance vs time curve. A plateau in absorbance was reached within a few minutes and maintained over time, indicating a fully formed, stable clot. No changes to coagulation rate (slope), half-maximal coagulation time, and extent of coagulation (FIGS. 26a-26c) were observed in samples incubated with progelator up to doses of 1:100 peptide/blood.",
                        "With hemocompatibility verified, we applied the progelator in an initial proof-of-concept study in vivo. Enzyme-responsive progelator, KFDFCyclic, doped with a small amount of Rho-KFDFCyclic (5 mol %) for imaging, was injected into the infarct region 7 days post-MI in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model (FIG. 8e). Assessment of hearts at 24 hr post-injection confirmed that progelator effectively gelled at the heart (FIG. 8e, FIGS. 27a-27b). Histological and fluorescence analysis of heart sections revealed hydrogel assembly occurred at the site of MI in all rats (FIGS. 8f-8g). This experiment demonstrates the activation and subsequent gelation of MMP responsive progelators to inflamed biological tissue.",
                        "The number of candidate biomaterials amenable to minimally invasive cardiac catheter delivery to the heart post-MI is limited. Consequently, translation of promising scaffolds from preclinical to clinical trials has been rare. Provided herein is a platform modification strategy to enable one class of hydrogels, SAPs, to be injectable via a cardiac injection catheter by conformationally constraining linear SAPs into macrocyclic progelators which resist self-assembly (FIGS. 1a-1c). These progelators were further modified with a substrate recognition sequence for endogenously expressed MI-associated proteases. The invention provides peptide sequences based on a known SAP, and then utilizing in silico modeling to provide preliminary insight into any modifications that may cause disruption of gelation (FIGS. 2a-2c). These modified sequences were then prepared synthetically for testing. Subsequent experimental analysis of self-assembly characteristics and mechanical properties agreed well with these predictions, namely that sequences modifications did not interfere with self-assembly as \u03b2-sheets into fibrils and viscoelastic hydrogels (FIGS. 3a-3h). It is hypothesized that the platform for modifications could be well-tolerated by other known SAP sequences used for biomedical applications.55,56",
                        "The versatility of the platform is demonstrated through the functionalization of two different SAPs sequences, which exhibit disparate self-assembly mechanisms, and yet form progelators with identical responsiveness. Cyclic progelators synthesized in FIGS. 4a-4k lacked the capacity to gel when sterically constrained. However, they exhibited responsiveness to enzymes that are inherently active in the MI during both the acute inflammatory phase and fibrotic phase (FIGS. 5a-5f). Despite the different cut sites recognized by MMP-9 catalytic domain, elastase, and thermolysin, similar secondary structure and nanoscale morphology changes were observed. Bulk cleavage of these sterically constrained materials resulted in healable viscoelastic hydrogels that were stable against excess proteolysis (FIGS. 6a-6g).",
                        "The development of smart structurally dynamic and responsive materials for tissue engineering post-MI is a relatively untapped field. With many scaffolds, the common issue remains that chemical modification (e.g. crosslinks, binding moieties, targeting motifs, or therapeutics drugs) can negatively impact material properties such as sample viscosity and gelation kinetics, which would preclude their use in catheters. With the present design, mechanical differences (e.g. stiffness or healing kinetics) in the resulting hydrogel would not affect the initial progelator formulation. Importantly, we provide the first demonstration of low viscosity peptide-based progelators for use in a cardiac injection catheter with little resistance to flow (FIGS. 7a-7d). The results of these experiments demonstrate that the cyclic progelator acts as a Newtonian fluid for smooth catheter-based injection and still retains the capacity to solidify when acted upon by endogenously expressed inflammatory enzymes in the heart, suggesting this could provide a useful strategy for cardiac catheter delivery in vivo.",
                        "With the potential for tissue leakage into the bloodstream, thrombogenicity of transendocardially injected biomaterials is a concern. Synthetic modifications to the KFDF SAP were shown to be hemocompatible and non-thrombogenic through a comprehensive assessment of whole blood clotting times, hemostatic kinetics, RBC hemolysis, and pro-thrombotic assays (FIGS. 8a-8g). A dosing analysis shows no statistically significant difference in hemostasis due to increasing progelator concentration in whole blood. The extent of coagulation in platelet poor plasma was only altered at the highest peptide dose which indicates that local high concentrations of peptide have an minor anti-coagulative effect on the intrinsic coagulation (contact-based) pathway; furthermore, the impact that the peptide does have on coagulation was shown to be independent of platelet-dependent thrombus formation, a key player in the pathogenesis of acute MI.57 This conclusion is supported by the lack of change in pro-thrombotic profiles when incubated with collagen, which increases clotting rates only through the activation of platelet aggregation.58 Given a \u201cstandard\u201d clinical concentration of 1:10,000,59 which assumes that no material was injected into the heart wall and instead escaped into the bloodstream, no adverse effects were observed on coagulation at this clinically relevant dose. These results indicate that this platform for generating an inert cyclic adduct of known SAPs should not result in unwanted blood interactions during delivery.",
                        "The present platform enables facile delivery of a free-flowing progelator, and on-demand gelation at the site of inflammation (FIG. 8). In vivo analysis of KFDFCyclic progelator revealed successful gelation of activated hydrogel scaffolds in a rat MI model. As such, the invention demonstrated a simplistic strategy that uses the naturally complex MI microenvironment for delivery and smart assembly in tissue. This proof-of-concept test paves the way for exploring the amenability of various other SAP systems (e.g. RAD16-II) with the progelator system for cardiac catheterization in vivo. In addition, there exists the potential to combine this approach with various therapeutics. In this study, appendage of a rhodamine dye to cyclic progelators did not disrupt gelation. The invention envisions a modular system to deliver and sustain any number of covalently bound therapeutics (e.g. small molecule drugs or short peptides). For larger therapeutics (e.g. stem cells and growth factors), simple formulation as a nonviscous solution for delivery, and subsequent encapsulation within the locally activated networks, might provide a means for targeted drug delivery without the need for complex synthetic manipulation. Ultimately, the simple strategy for structural control of self-assembling peptides can be employed for minimally invasive delivery of therapeutic peptides to other forms of injury or disease where MMPs are upgregulated, including osteoarthritis,60 cartilage tissue repair,41 nerve damage,61,62 and acute brain injury63.",

FibPredictor was utilized as a commercially available software for generating native-like amyloid fibril structures.42 This software was chosen for our study due to its unique ability to reliably model all classes of amyloid fibrils starting from sequence-only input. The algorithm combines \u03b2-sheet model building, \u03b2-sheet replication, and symmetry operations with side-chain prediction and statistical scoring functions, for computational predictions on amyloid fibril structures of self-assembling peptides utilized in this study. From each random model generated, a SCRWL internal scoring function was used by SCWRL4 to predict the energetically lowest side chain orientations. This scoring function was used to calculate the minimal total energy of the entire model and outputs coordinates for the structure as a PDB file with predicted side chains using the same residue numbering and chain identifiers as the input structure. To identify the most energetically favorable candidate structures in the ensemble, both Amb_3 b (computationally more efficient)69 and GOAP (more accurate)70 statistical scoring functions were used to calculate total energies of the protein structure. Reported energies are unitless as they are empirically derived scores, thus it is not advisable to interpret results as kcal/mol.

After euthanasia, hearts were resected, fresh frozen in TissueTek OCT, and cryosectioned for histological analysis. Slides were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to identify the infarct region or stained for immunofluorescence analysis. H&E slides were imaged on an Aperio ScanScope CS2 at 20\u00d7 magnification. For immunofluorescence, tissue sections were permeabilized in acetone (\u221220\u00b0 C.) for 1.5 min and blocked with 2% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Myocardium was labeled using mouse anti-\u03b1-actinin antibody (1:800 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 hr incubation, Sigma-Aldrich) and an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer, 30 min incubation, Life Technologies). Nuclei were labeled using Hoechst 33342 (0.1 \u03bcg/mL in DI water, 10 min incubation, Life Technologies).
