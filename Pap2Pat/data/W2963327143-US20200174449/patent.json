                        "Described herein is a platform for the design and fabrication of high efficiency dielectric metadevices. The metadevices are designed by way of inverse electromagnetic design computational methods, and in one embodiment the metadevices are fabricated using additive manufacturing. The metadevices described herein are designed to provide complete control of the phase and the polarization of an incident wave. In particular, the embodiments described herein can be used to create millimeter-wave frequency metadevices that perform polarization splitting, beam bending, and focusing with high efficiency over a broad range of wavelength range. The methods described herein are scalable and can also be extended for the design and fabrication of electromagnetic and photonic metadevices spanning microwave to optical frequencies.",
                        "Conventional optical elements that control the polarization, phase, and amplitude of electromagnetic (EM) radiation include lenses, polarizers, beamsplitters, and mirrors. Such optical elements are typically engineered at a scale larger than the wavelength. Within the last two decades, a significant amount of research has been devoted to understanding light-matter interactions, designing novel materials, and designing electromagnetic devices with subwavelength feature sizes. Metamaterials, and more generally materials composed of nanostructures with subwavelength feature size, have emerged as a viable platform to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in an unconventional manner. In particular, photonic crystals and negative-index materials are used to achieve sub-diffraction lensing. More recently, metasurfaces have gained substantial interest due to their ability to perform optical functionalities such as lensing, holograms, and beam shaping within an extremely thin layer.",
                        "Metasurfaces are formed of discrete subwavelength resonant elements arranged in a specific manner to impart a desired global phase change to an incoming electromagnetic wave. Using subwavelength thick metasurfaces to control phase, amplitude, and polarization is a promising route towards building miniature optical devices. However, existing design and fabrication methods suffer from several drawbacks prohibiting the potential of using metasurfaces to replace conventional bulk optical elements. Initial metasurface designs utilized plasmonic metals that exhibited high optical losses, leading to relatively low efficiency. Additionally, although metals can be replaced with high-index dielectric materials such as silicon, such metasurfaces often rely on Mie-type resonances that result in a narrow wavelength operation range.",
                        "Typically, metasurface design starts with identification of an optical resonator with a well-defined geometrical shape, such as a triangle, rectangle, ellipse, V-antenna, etc. Phase information is then calculated for various geometrical parameters such as radius, width, orientation, etc. However, metadevices which are based on traditionally designed ultrathin metasurfaces often yield polarization dependency and narrowband optical response, as their design relies on subwavelength optical resonators.",
                        "Described herein is an inverse electromagnetic design method to form high-efficiency (e.g., >60%), broadband (e.g., \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb>25%, where \u03bb is wavelength), dielectric-based thin (e.g., \u22642\u03bb) electromagnetic metadevices overcoming the aforementioned limitations of traditional metadevices. In alternative embodiments, the efficiency value, broadband value, and/or thickness of metadevices described herein may differ from the values identified above. The metadevices created using the processes described herein can be non-resonant structures which have a very broad response as compared with traditional devices. Also, the metadevices described herein can allow manipulation of light/radiation in plane.",
                        "Inverse-design refers to the use of an algorithm to design different types of devices. Inverse-design algorithms include objective-first algorithms, topology optimization algorithms, brute force algorithms, genetic algorithms, etc. The present description focuses primarily on objective-first inverse design, but the embodiments disclosed herein are not so limited and other types of inverse-design may also be used. By using an optimization algorithm that is coupled with an electromagnetic simulation, a complex dielectric structure that provides a desired phase change distribution for a desired optical functionality can be designed. As used herein, inverse-design refers to a process in which a computing system computationally designs a device based on a set of functionalities that one wants the device to achieve. In the context of metadevices, a set of electromagnetic input and output values is designated, and the computing system designs a metadevice that satisfies those values.",
                        "As discussed herein, the inventors have also identified benefits to using an additive manufacturing process, such as 3D printing, to create optical metadevices that are designed using an inverse design methodology. The use of such additive manufacturing allows creation of devices which cannot be fabricated using traditional removal techniques such as milling. In one embodiment, the 3D-printed devices can be made of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and fabricated with a consumer 3D-printer based on fused deposition modeling. In alternative embodiments, a different fabrication material and/or technique may be used. The HIPS material has low cost and very low attenuation in the microwave and millimeter-wave wavelengths, with a loss-tangent measured to be tan \u03b4<0.003 over the 26-38 GHz band. The real part of the dielectric constant of HIPS was \u03b5\u2032\u22482.3 (n\u22481.52) in this band, which can be used as a constraint in the inverse-design algorithm to design binary devices made of air (\u03b5=1) and HIPS (\u03b5=2.3). Because of the low index, the phase between the input and output is approximately proportional to the effective thickness of the polymer. Therefore, in order to allow a 2\u03c0 phase shift between a part full of polymer and a part full of air, the device thickness should obey Equation 1 below. In this particular embodiment, Equation 1 indicates that the thickness of the metadevices should be slightly larger than 2\u03c0.",

The metadevice is surrounded by radar absorbing material to prevent the signal from going around it. For the polarization splitters and beam bending metadevices, the transmitted power was measured in the far-field (>100\u03bb) with a low gain horn antenna as a function of the angle between \u221240\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 by 2\u00b0 steps, and as a function of the frequency between 26 GHz (11.5 mm) and 38 GHz (7.9 mm). For the created metalenses, the transmitted power can be measured in the near-field with a probe antenna scanned in the x-y plane at the output of the devices. The results of the measurements taken from actual metadevices created in accordance with the embodiments described herein are discussed below with reference to the figures.",

The methodologies can, however, be used to create a number of different metadevices, including devices operating in near-infrared for telecommunications, devices operating in mid/long-infrared and THz for chemical sensing and IR imaging, devices operating microwave and millimeter wave for wireless communications and military applications, dielectric antennas with low loss optimized for specific beam shaping between near-infrared and millimeter waves, ultra-thin lenses for beam focusing in the near-filed, polarization splitters, wavelength separators, on-chip control of light propagation (near-IR), passive optical devices for THz radiation, etc.",

More specifically, FIG. 1A is a block diagram depicting a free-space polarization splitter meta-grating that bends parallel and perpendicular polarizations to opposite diffraction orders in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The design and fabrication processes described herein can also be used to create a meta-grating that bends both polarizations to the same diffraction order. FIG. 1B is a block diagram depicting a flat metalens device that focuses a plane wave onto a cylindrical wave at a chosen focal point in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. As discussed in more detail below, the desired optical functionality of the metadevices is defined as a set of input and output conditions at the boundaries of the design space.",
                        "As part of the inverse design process, the objective-first algorithm can be used, and the electromagnetic wave equation is treated as an optimization problem. The electric field, E and the dielectric permittivity, \u03b5, can be solved for using Eq. 2 below, based on a desired input and output electromagnetic field distribution.",

                        "Such an optimization problem is non-convex. Therefore, there is no general method to find the optimum solution. However, suitable solutions that satisfy desired functionality with acceptable performance can be reached. An on-chip wavelength splitter and an optical diode have been successfully demonstrated using such an inverse electromagnetic design approach.",
                        "Bending and polarization splitting are achieved with meta-gratings that convert an input plane wave to an output plane wave with a different diffraction order than m=0, with periodic boundary conditions along the x-axis. For metalenses, one goal is to focus a plane wave at a desired focal length. Thus, in one embodiment, the output is chosen to be a cylindrical wave centered at a specific location. Metalenses do not perform like a grating. Thus, in the case of metalenses, the boundary conditions are set to be a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) along the x direction. In one embodiment, the inverse design described herein is two-dimensional, and it is therefore assumed that metadevices have infinite height along the z axis. In practice, the fabricated devices are \u224810\u03bb thick. However, in alternative embodiments, different thicknesses may be used such as 5\u03bb, 7\u03bb, 12\u03bb, etc.",
                        "Inverse-designed metadevices are realized using additive manufacturing, which is commonly referred to as 3D-printing. This bottom-up approach allows the fabrication of complex devices with high aspect ratio. Furthermore, 3D-printing is a scalable method, with resolutions ranging from \u02dc100 nm to 1 \u02dcmm or larger, allowing the fabrication of electromagnetic devices with applications from visible light to millimeter waves and microwaves. As a result, the proposed devices described herein can be practically realized for microwave and millimeter waves with polymer-based 3D-printing.",
                        "FIG. 2A depicts a free-space polarization splitter operational at millimeter-wave wavelengths in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. More specifically, FIG. 2A depicts a schematic drawing (left) and a top-view photograph (right) of a 3D printed 30\u00b0 polarization splitter. The photograph (right) of the 3D-printed metadevice shown next to the computer-generated pattern (left) in FIG. 2A illustrates the high fidelity of the 3D-printing process. The dashed line rectangle of FIG. 2A indicates a unit cell of the grating. The metadevice of FIG. 2A deflects a normal incident plane-wave polarized along they (parallel) and z (perpendicular) directions into m=+1 and m=\u22121 diffraction orders, respectively, with high efficiency and over a broad bandwidth. With respect to design parameters, the metadevice of FIG. 2A was assumed to be periodic in the y-direction and infinite along the z direction. The width of the metadevice was chosen to be \u02dc2\u03bb, but can be different in alternative embodiments. The periodicity, L, along they axis was determined by the deflection angle \u03b8 of the desired diffraction order m (here, m=\u00b11 for all devices), following the grating equation L sin \u03b8=m\u03bb. The metadevice was designed and optimized for an operation frequency of 33 GHz, \u03bb=9.1 mm, and a deflection angle of \u03b8=\u00b130\u00b0, for which L=1.8 cm. The inverse-design algorithm generated a binary refractive index distribution of dielectric and air that was then printed with dimensions of 2 cm\u00d77.2 cm\u00d78 cm.",
                        "Far-field angular transmission through the actual metadevice of FIG. 2A was measured to verify predicted polarization splitting behavior. FIG. 2B depicts plots of simulated power distribution and measured power distribution at 33 GHz in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In FIG. 2B, dashed lines represent simulated values and circles represent measured values of far-field power as a function of deflection angle for both polarizations. In the metadevice of FIG. 2A, a plane wave with parallel polarization was observed to bend at an angle of \u03b832 +30\u00b0, whereas perpendicular polarization was deflected with an angle of \u03b8=\u221230\u00b0. The total power transmitted by the metadevice at 33 GHz was measured to be 76% for the parallel polarization and 54% for the perpendicular polarization, which is lower than the simulated values of 90% due to structural imperfections. The rejection ratio, defined as the ratio between the peak intensity and the maximum intensity outside the main peak, was experimentally found to be 5.2 dB and 7.0 dB for parallel and perpendicular polarizations, respectively, which is close to the simulation values of 6.6 dB and 9.3 dB, respectively.",
                        "Full-field electromagnetic simulations were performed to calculate the electromagnetic properties of the metadevice of FIG. 2A. FIG. 2C depicts simulated Hz field amplitudes for parallel polarizations at 33 GHz in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. FIG. 2D depicts simulated E field amplitudes for perpendicular polarizations at 33 GHz in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Spatial electromagnetic field distribution provides a clear picture of how the EM wave propagates inside the metadevice. For example, the metadevice of FIG. 2A presents a dielectric filling fraction gradient along the y-direction between a part mostly filled with dielectric (\u03b5=2.3), where the phase was shifted by 6\u03c0, and a part mostly void (\u03b5=1.0) where the phase was shifted by only 4\u03c0, allowing a 2\u03c0 phase shift in the y-direction. The polarization splitting was a result of the different phase change response of the different polarizations resulting from the complex dielectric shape of the device.",
                        "Although 33 GHz was chosen to be the optimum frequency with highest efficiency in the inverse-design algorithm, broad operation bandwidth was observed that spanned the entire measurement range, which was enabled by the inverse-design method favoring non-resonant dielectric structures. As such, in alternative embodiments, different frequencies may be used to design metadevices in accordance with the inverse-design algorithm. FIG. 2E depicts simulated far-field intensity as a function of the output angle and the frequency for parallel polarizations in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. FIG. 2F depicts simulated far-field intensity as a function of the output angle and the frequency for perpendicular polarizations in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. FIG. 2G depicts measured far-field intensity as a function of the output angle and the frequency for parallel polarizations in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. FIG. 2H depicts measured far-field intensity as a function of the output angle and the frequency perpendicular polarizations in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. As illustrated, the simulations and measurements agreed well, apart from minor differences that can be explained by the finite number of periods in the printed structures as well as an imperfect plane wave input.",

FIG. 3A depicts a polarization splitter with a 15\u00b0 bending angle as a function of the output angle for a frequency of 33 GHz in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Similar to the 30\u00b0 splitter, the metadevice of FIG. 3A presents a gradient of dielectric filling fraction along the y-direction with a larger periodicity (L=3.5 cm) to favor a smaller bending angle. FIG. 3B depicts simulated (dashed lines) and experimental (circles) far-field intensity of the 15\u00b0 polarization splitter of FIG. 3A as a function of the output angle for a frequency of 33 GHz in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The measured rejection ratios for the 15\u00b0 splitter are 8.2 dB and 10.6 dB for parallel and perpendicular polarizations, respectively.",

                        "Although polarization-independent bending of EM radiation can be achieved with a triangular blazed grating, it has been demonstrated that such gratings deflect a significant amount of power to the higher diffraction orders. On average, from 26 to 38 GHz, the inverse-designed metadevices reduce the amount of power sent into undesired diffraction orders by a factor of 2.8 for parallel polarization and 2.0 for perpendicular polarization, when compared to a blazed grating with similar thickness. FIGS. 6A-6F show a comparison between the performance of the inverse-designed device (FIGS. 6A-6C) and a blazed grating (FIGS. 6D-6F) optimized to bend electromagnetic radiation by 30\u00b0 independently of the polarization in accordance with illustrative embodiments. The simulated far-field intensities are represented for angles from \u221280\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 and for frequencies from 26 GHz to 38 GHz for perpendicular polarizations (FIGS. 6B and 6E) and parallel polarizations (FIGS. 6C and 6F). As can be seen, the inverse-designed metadevice transmits a much lower power to undesired grating orders (23% for perpendicular polarization and 18% for parallel polarization) than the blazed grating (47% for perpendicular polarization and 51% for parallel polarization). Simulated rejection ratios at 32 GHz are 10.1 dB (perpendicular polarization) and 12.4 dB (parallel polarization) for the inverse-designed bend, compared to 6.6 dB (perpendicular polarization) and 3.8 dB (parallel polarization) for the triangular grating.",
