    "date": "2018-01-22",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a platform combining an inverse electromagnetic design computational method with additive manufacturing to design and fabricate all-dielectric metadevices. As opposed to conventional flat metasurface-based devices that are composed of resonant building blocks resulting in narrow band operation, the proposed design approach creates non-resonant, broadband (\u0394 \u03bb /\u03bb up to >50%) metadevices based on low-index dielectric materials. High-efficiency (transmission >60%), thin (\u22642\u03bb) metadevices capable of polarization splitting, beam bending, and focusing are proposed. Experimental demonstrations are performed at millimeter-wave frequencies using 3D-printed devices. The proposed platform can be readily applied to the design and fabrication of electromagnetic and photonic metadevices spanning microwave to optical frequencies.",

                "Conventional optical elements that control the polarization, phase and amplitude of electromagnetic (EM) radiation such as lenses, polarizers, beamsplitters, and mirrors are typically engineered at a scale much larger than the wavelength. Within the last two decades, significant amount of research has been devoted to understand light-matter interactions and design novel materials and electromagnetic devices with subwavelength features. Metamaterials, and more generally materials composed of nanostructures with subwavelength feature size, have emerged as a viable platform to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in unconventional manners1,2. In particular, photonic crystals3 and negative-index materials4 have been used to achieve sub-diffraction lensing5\u20137. More recently, metasurfaces8\u201310 have gained substantial interest due to their ability to perform optical functionalities such as lensing11, holograms12,13 and beam shaping14 within an extremely thin layer. Although the ability to control phase, amplitude and polarization using subwavelength-thick metasurfaces is a promising route towards building miniature optical devices, they suffer from several drawbacks prohibiting their potential in replacing conventional bulk optical elements. Initial metasurface designs utilized plasmonic metals that exhibit high optical losses and thus were of relatively low efficiency15. Lossy metals have been replaced with high-index dielectric materials like amorphous silicon16, but such metasurfaces often rely on Mie-type resonances that result in a narrow wavelength range of operation14,17.",
                "Typical metasurface design starts with identification of an optical resonator with a well-defined geometrical shape, such as triangles18, rectangles12,19, ellipses14 or V-antennas8,15. Phase information is then calculated for various geometrical parameters such as radius, width, orientation, etc.16. The number of degrees of freedom in the design of these shapes is very limited, which makes it difficult to optimize both efficiency and bandwidth of metadevices while achieving full control of the polarization. Here, we use an inverse electromagnetic method20\u201326 to design high-efficiency (>60%), broadband (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u2009>\u200925%), dielectric-based thin (\u22642\u03bb) electromagnetic metadevices overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Inverse design opens up the entire design space to enable metadevices with increased and enhanced functionalities. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our inverse design approach, we use additive manufacturing to print a low-loss polymer into a complex geometrical pattern. We demonstrate the design, fabrication and characterization of wavelength-scale metadevices for bending, polarization splitting and focusing of EM radiation at millimeter-wave frequencies."

                "First, we design two meta-gratings to behave as polarization beamsplitters for normally incident free-space radiation. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a01A, those devices bend parallel and perpendicular polarizations to opposite diffraction orders. We also design a meta-grating that bends both polarizations to the same diffraction order (Fig.\u00a01B). Finally, we propose a ~\u03bb-thick flat metalens (Fig.\u00a01C) that converts a normally incident plane-wave into a focusing cylindrical wave.Figure 1Schematics for the inverse electromagnetic approach for designing free-space metadevices. The desired optical functionality is defined by a set of input and output conditions at the boundaries of the design space. A polarization splitter (A) is a grating that converts normally incident plane waves of parallel and perpendicular polarizations into two different diffraction orders. A bending device (B) converts a normally incident plane wave into the same diffraction order. A flat metalens (C) is a device that converts a plane wave into a cylindrical wave converging to a chosen focal point.",
                "We use the objective-first algorithm22,27,28 in which the electromagnetic wave equation:\\[\\min_{\\varepsilon,E}\\nabla \\times \\nabla \\times E - w^{2}\\varepsilon E\\] is treated as an optimization problem. This nonlinear optimization is decomposed in two subproblems, where each variable (\u03b5 and E) is fixed while linear optimization is performed on the other variable, alternatively and iteratively, and where boundary electromagnetic field distributions reprenting the desired behavior are constraints of the model. There is no general method to find the optimum solution of (1), but the proposed method converges most of the times towards solutions that satisfy desired functionality with acceptable performance. An on-chip wavelength splitter22 and an optical diode29 have been successfully demonstrated using such inverse electromagnetic design approach.",
                "Bending and polarization splitting are achieved using meta-gratings that convert an input plane wave to an output plane wave with a different diffraction order than m\u2009=\u20090, with periodic boundary conditions along the x-axis. For metalenses, we aim to focus an input plane wave at a desired focal distance; hence, the output is chosen to be the field of a cylindrical wave centered in the desired focal point, following the equation (approximation at large r):\\[E_{z}(r) = E_{z0}r^{- \\frac{1}{2}}\\exp ikr\\] where r is the distance from the focal point. Metalenses do not perform like a grating; therefore, we set the boundary conditions of a perfectly matched layer (PML) along the x direction. The designs are two-dimensional, which corresponds to metadevices with infinite height along z. In practice, the fabricated devices are \u224810\u03bb thick."

                        "Inverse-designed metadevices are fabricated using additive manufacturing, commonly called 3D-printing. This bottom-up approach allows the fabrication of very complex devices with a large aspect ratio. Furthermore, 3D-printing is an incredibly scalable method, with resolutions ranging from 100\u2009nm to 1\u2009mm30\u201332, allowing the fabrication of electromagnetic devices for applications from the visible to the millimeter- wave and microwave regimes33\u201336. Here, we demonstrate the proposed devices in the millimeter-wave regime (f\u2009>\u200930\u2009GHz) using high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and a consumer grade 3D-printer based on fused deposition modeling for the fabrication. The material is chosen for its low cost and very low attenuation in the microwave to millimeter-wave region, with a loss-tangent measured to be \\(\\tan\\delta < 0.003\\)  over the 26\u201338\u2009GHz band.

Because of the low index, the phase difference between the input and output is approximately proportional to the effective thickness of the polymer. Therefore, in order to allow a 2\u03c0 phase shift between a part full of polymer and a part full of air, the device thickness needs to obey:\\[\\Delta\\varphi = 2\\pi\\left( {n - 1} \\right)\\frac{t}{\\lambda} = 2\\pi \\times 0.52 \\times \\frac{t}{\\lambda} \\geq 2\\pi,\\] which means that the minimum device thickness is around 2\u03bb."

The device is surrounded by radar absorbing material to prevent reflections from the surroundings. For the three meta-gratings, the transmitted power is measured in the far-field (>100\u03bb) with a low-gain horn antenna as a function of the angle between \u221240\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 in 2\u00b0 steps and as a function of the frequency between 26\u2009GHz (11.5\u2009mm) and 38\u2009GHz (7.9\u2009mm). For the lenses, the output power is mapped along the axial plane on the right side of the device using a probe antenna attached to a X-Y stage. The measurement starts around 1\u2009cm to the right of the device due to technical limitations of the setup, which is the reason why the experimental intensity maps are truncated when compared to the simulated maps."

                        "First, we demonstrate a free-space polarization splitter. The proposed metadevice (Fig.\u00a02A) deflects a normal incident plane-wave polarized along y (parallel) and z (perpendicular) directions into m\u2009=\u2009+1 and m\u2009=\u2009\u22121 diffraction orders respectively with high efficiency and over a broad bandwidth. The width is chosen to be ~2\u03bb to reach desired phase change as explained in the experimental section. The periodicity, L along y is determined by the deflection angle \u03b8 of the desired diffraction order m (here m\u2009=\u2009\u00b11 for all devices), following the grating equation \\(L\\sin\\theta = m\\mathit{\\lambda}\\) . We designed and optimized the metadevice for an operation frequency of 33\u2009GHz (free space wavelength of \u03bb\u2009=\u20099.1\u2009mm) and a deflection angle of \u03b8\u2009=\u2009\u00b130\u00b0, for which L\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009cm.

A photograph of the 3D-printed metadevice is shown next to the computer-generated pattern in Fig.\u00a02A, which shows the high fidelity of the 3D-printing method.Figure 2Inverse-designed polarization splitter.

                        "We measured the far-field angular transmission through the fabricated metadevice to verify the predicted polarization splitting behavior. Figure\u00a02B plots the simulated and measured power distributions at 33\u2009GHz. We observe that a plane wave with parallel polarization is bent at an angle \u03b8\u2009=\u2009+30\u00b0, whereas the perpendicular polarization is deflected with an angle of \u03b8\u2009=\u2009\u221230\u00b0. The total power transmitted by the metadevice at 33\u2009GHz is measured to be 76% for the parallel polarization and 54% for the perpendicular polarization, which are lower than the simulated values of 90%. The discrepancy is likely due to structure imperfections in the fabricated devices, the finite number of periods in the printed structures as well as an imperfect plane-wave input. The rejection ratio, defined as the ratio between the peak intensity and the maximum intensity outside the main peak, is experimentally found to be 5.2\u2009dB and 7.0\u2009dB for the parallel and perpendicular polarizations, respectively, which are close to the simulated values of 6.6\u2009dB and 9.3\u2009dB, respectively.",
                        "We perform full-field electromagnetic simulations to calculate the electromagnetic properties of the metadevice. We plot the vertical fields, i.e. Hz for parallel polarization (Fig.\u00a02C) and Ez for perpendicular polarization (Fig.\u00a02D), at 33\u2009GHz. The spatial field distribution provides a clear picture of how the EM waves propagate inside the metadevice. In metasurfaces based on resonant geometric elements, the phase change is due to the interaction of the incoming plane-wave to a strong Mie resonance mode14, which typically results in a relatively narrowband operation. Here, the phase change does not stem from the interaction with a specific resonant mode, but rather due to light propagation inside the dielectric structure, with a larger phase shift of 6\u03c0 in a part filled with dielectric (\u03b5\u2009=\u20092.3) than a 4\u03c0 shift in a part mostly void (\u03b5\u2009=\u20091.0). The polarization splitting is a result of the different phase-change response of the device to different polarizations owing to its complex dielectric shape.",
                        "Although we choose 33\u2009GHz to be the frequency to optimize for highest efficiency in our inverse-design algorithm, we observe broad operation bandwidth that spans a range of frequencies from 27 to 38\u2009GHz, for a relative bandwidth \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb \u2248 33%, which is enabled by the inverse-design method favoring non-resonant dielectric structures. Figure\u00a02 plots simulated (E,F) and measured (G,H) power transmitted in the far-field as a function of the angle and the frequency for parallel (E,G) and perpendicular (F,H) polarizations. The simulations and measurements agree relatively well.",
                        "In order to demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of the inverse-design approach, we designed and fabricated two additional metadevices that bend the millimeter-waves. The first one is a polarization splitter with a bending angle of +/\u221215\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a03A). Similar to the 30\u00b0 splitter, this device presents a gradient of dielectric filling fraction along the y-direction with a larger periodicity (L\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009cm) in order to favor a smaller bending angle. The simulated and measured angular far-field transmitted powers are plotted for both polarizations at 33\u2009GHz in Fig.\u00a03B. The measured rejection ratios for the 15\u00b0 splitter are 8.2\u2009dB and 10.6\u2009dB for parallel and perpendicular polarizations respectively. The device has a dielectric filling fraction with a similar profile to that of a bending device towards the +15\u00b0 diffraction order. The polarization splitting is due to the coupling of perpendicular polarization to a resonant wave propagating along the y-direction inside the device, which reverses the bending direction. This explains the lower bandwidth of the device for perpendicular polarization, from 31 to 37\u2009GHz (a relative bandwidth of 18%), compared to a very large bandwidth for the bending behavior of parallel polarization, from 22 to 44\u2009GHz (data not shown). The designs, simulated fields and broadband far-field data are shown in Figure\u00a0S1 in the supplementary information.Figure 3Inverse-designed meta-gratings. Photographs (A, and C) and simulated (dashed lines) and experimental (circles) far-field intensity plots of the 15\u00b0 polarization splitter (B) and the 30\u00b0 bending device (D) as a function of the output angle for a frequency of 33\u2009GHz.",
                        "In addition to polarization beam-splitter, we also designed and realized a polarization-independent bending device (Fig.\u00a03C) which bends both polarizations to the same diffraction order. Simulations and experimental results of the far-field power at 33\u2009GHz are shown in Fig.\u00a03D, showing very good agreement between the theory and experiment. The designs, simulated fields and broadband far-field data are shown in Figure\u00a0S2. Although polarization-independent bending of EM radiation can be achieved with a triangular blazed grating (Fig.\u00a04D), such gratings deflect significant amount of power to higher diffraction orders, as shown in Fig.\u00a04E,F. On average from 26 to 38\u2009GHz, the inverse-designed device reduces the amount of power sent into undesired diffraction orders by a factor of 2.8 for parallel polarization and 2.0 for perpendicular polarization when compared to a blazed grating of similar thickness, which can be seen on the far-field power in Fig.\u00a04B,C. The bending to the first diffraction order extends to 44\u2009GHz with high efficiency (data not shown), which corresponds to a relative bandwidth of 55%, but significant power is diffracted to higher orders for larger frequencies.Figure 4Comparison between the performance of the inverse-designed device (A to C) and a blazed grating (D to F) optimized to bend electromagnetic radiation by 30\u00b0 independently of the polarization. The simulated far-field intensities are represented for angles from \u221280\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 and for frequencies from 26\u2009GHz to 38\u2009GHz for perpendicular (B,E) and parallel (C,F) polarizations. As can be seen, the inverse-designed metadevice transmits a much lower power to undesired grating orders (23% for perpendicular polarization and 18% for parallel polarization) than the blazed grating (47% for perpendicular polarization and 51% for parallel polarization). Simulated rejection ratios at 33\u2009GHz are 10.1\u2009dB and 12.4\u2009dB for the inverse-designed bending device, compared to 6.6\u2009dB and 3.8\u2009dB for the triangular grating for perpendicular and parallel polarizations respectively."
