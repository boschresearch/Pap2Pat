    "abstract": "The impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance and disruption of the beneficial microbiome compels the urgent investigation of bacteria-specific approaches such as antibody-based strategies. Among these, DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs), produced by muscle cells in vivo, potentially allow the prevention or treatment of bacterial infections circumventing some of the hurdles of protein IgG delivery. Here, we optimize DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies consisting of two potent human IgG clones, including a non-natural bispecific IgG1 candidate, targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies exhibit indistinguishable potency compared to bioprocessed IgG and protect against lethal pneumonia in mice. The DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies decrease bacterial colonization of organs and exhibit enhanced adjunctive activity in combination with antibiotics. These studies support DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies delivery as a potential strategy to augment the host immune response to prevent serious bacterial infections, and represent a significant advancement toward broader practical delivery of monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutics for additional infectious pathogens.DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies (DMAbs) can be produced by muscle cells in vivo, potentially allowing prevention or treatment of infectious diseases. Here, the authors show that two DMAbs targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins confer protection against lethal pneumonia in mice.",

                "The impact of growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arising from broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure threatens the antibiotic cornerstone of modern medicine. The global rate of mortality from AMR infections is estimated to be >700\u2009000/year and expected to rise over the next decade1, and the CDC reports over 2 million AMR cases in the United States each year (>23\u2009000 deaths/year)2. The lack of progress in the development of new antibiotic classes and new understanding of host-pathogen interactions is prompting interest in microbiome-friendly approaches that engage the immune system with minimal disruption of the normal microbiota. One such approach is the investigation of antibody technology for preventing and treating bacterial infections. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are now a mainstay to treat several diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders, asthma, cancer, and graft transplantation (reviewed in refs.3\u20138). However, only two mAbs are approved for treatment of infectious diseases in humans, palivizumab (targeting respiratory syncytial virus) and bezlotoxumab (targeting Clostridium difficile toxin B). Raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab, both targeting inhalation anthrax, were approved under the Food and Drug Administration \ufeff(FDA) animal rule because they could not be reasonably tested for efficacy in humans. Several other infectious disease mAb candidates are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov, reviewed in refs 9, 10). Yet, there are several technological hurdles with cost-effective mAb-based delivery that impede a paradigm shift from broad-spectrum approaches to pathogen-specific, targeted prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. These limitations to protein IgG administration include dosage (in the range of mg/kg), mAb production challenges, and significant costs associated with current manufacturing technology.",
                "DNA plasmid delivery offers a novel approach to circumvent the hurdles of traditional mAb delivery through direct, in vivo immunoglobulin (Ig) production. DNA-delivered monoclonal antibodies (DMAb) are transiently expressed and secreted by skeletal muscle cells and directly enter the systemic circulation to prevent virulence while promoting bacterial clearance. This is facilitated though specific Ig heavy and light chain nucleotide sequence optimizations, formulation development, and by recent advances in in vivo electroporation (EP) technology that has directly lead to increased DNA uptake into cells, translating to significantly enhanced DNA expression in vivo11.",
                "Employing this pathogen-specific approach we utilized the DMAb platform to deliver two well-characterized mAbs targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an environmentally ubiquitous bacterium that can cause life-threatening infections in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. In addition, intrinsic antibiotic resistance via elaborate drug efflux systems, the acquisition of antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer, as well as the ability to form biofilms makes P. aeruginosa a formidable foe in seriously ill patients. Two promising mAb targets against P. aeruginosa include the Psl exopolysaccharide and the type 3 secretion (T3S) injectisome PcrV protein. Psl is a highly abundant serotype-independent polysaccharide important for host cell attachment, biofilm formation, and immune evasion12\u201314. The T3S injectisome induces intoxication by injection of multiple effectors directly into the host cell cytoplasm where they interact with a multitude of eukaryotic co-factors. PcrV is thought to sit at the apex of the molecular syringe and plays a prominent role, along with other bacterial proteins, in host cell membrane pore formation15. Protective mAbs to both targets were recently described, with each alone exhibiting potent activity in multiple P. aeruginosa infection models16, 17. In addition, clinical candidate MEDI3902, a bispecific mAb targeting Psl and PcrV, was recently described and shown to exhibit synergistic protective activity when compared to the individual mAbs or a parental mAb mixture18. DMAb delivery as an alternative strategy to bypass the need for protein IgG could be highly beneficial for administration of pathogen-specific mAbs to at-risk target populations. Furthermore, the low cost of DMAb production, the favorable safety profile of DNA delivery in humans, and the ease of administration19 would benefit a wider population of individuals that are at risk for infection.",
                "Here, we describe the development and analysis of synthetic DMAbs consisting of a monospecific anti-PcrV IgG (DMAb-\u03b1PcrV) and clinical candidate bispecific antibody MEDI3902 (DMAb-BiSPA) for in vivo production and activity. We observe that DMAb production in vivo can rapidly yield functional and protective titers for both constructs. These DMAbs can persist and have similar potency to bioprocess-produced mAbs, along with comparable prevention of P. aeruginosa colonisation of major organs. We also demonstrate that skeletal muscle cells can support production and secretion of functional, engineered bispecific IgG. This finding highlights the flexibility of the host cellular machinery to form novel, non-natural Ig forms in vivo and expands the possibilities for encoding additional pathogenic-specific affinities. Furthermore, we show that DMAb-BiSPA exhibits enhanced protective activity with antibiotic treatment in a lethal pneumonia model. Taken together, our results suggest that DNA delivery of full length IgG mAbs is a promising strategy for prevention of serious bacterial infections and possibly for other therapeutic indications."

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) heavy and light chains (Fab and Fc portions) were optimized taking into consideration both human and mouse codon bias, and encoded as a single, polycistronic unit in the pGX0001 DNA plasmid backbone, resulting in two constructs: DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and DMAb-BiSPA (Fig.\u00a01a). The heavy and light chains are expressed as a single mRNA transcript and then cleaved post-translationally at a porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A) cleavage site. A furin cleavage site (RGRKRRS) was also included to ensure complete removal of the P2A from the final in vivo produced antibody.Fig. 1Schematic diagram of DMAb delivery and in vitro expression. a DMAbs were designed to encode IgG antibody heavy and light chains of monoclonal antibody clones V2L2MD and MEDI3902, resulting in the DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and DMAb-BiSPA constructs.

To confirm DMAb expression in mouse muscle, anti-P. aeruginosa DMAb-\u03b1PcrV (100\u2009\u03bcg), DMAb-BiSPA (100\u2009\u03bcg), control DMAb-DVSF3 (100\u2009\u03bcg), or control pGX0001 empty vector (100\u2009\u03bcg) were administered to BALB/c mice by intramuscular (IM) injection in the tibialis anterior (TA), followed by intramuscular electroporation (IM-EP). Muscle tissue was harvested 3 days post injection and sections were probed with a goat anti-human IgG Fc antibody followed by detection with a donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to AF488 (Fig.\u00a02). Following confirmation of expression in vivo, we performed further experiments to assay DMAb levels in systemic circulation. Human IgG1 induces an anti-antibody response in immunocompetent mice, since it is recognized as non-self by the murine immune system. Therefore, we first evaluated expression in immunocompromised B6.Cg-Foxn1nu/J athymic mice (nude) that lack T cells and have non-functional B cells. Anti-P. aeruginosa DMAb-\u03b1PcrV (100\u2009\u03bcg) or DMAb-BiSPA (100\u2009\u03bcg) was administered to nude mice (n\u2009=\u20095/group) IM in the TA or quadriceps (quad) muscles, followed by IM-EP. Serum was collected to monitor long-term human IgG1 expression in circulation. Expression of both DMAbs was observed for 100\u2013120 days post administration, supporting the hypothesis that these novel DNA-delivered mAbs can be produced in skeletal muscle in substantial amounts detectable in systemic circulation, with expression for several weeks (Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 2Expression of DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and DMAb-BiSPA in mouse skeletal muscle.

To address the functional activity of in vivo DNA-delivered DMAbs, we evaluated protection against the highly pathogenic and cytotoxic P. aeruginosa strain 6077 (PA 6077), using a lethal mouse pneumonia infection model. Mice were injected 5 days before PA 6077 challenge with DMAb-\u03b1PcrV (300\u2009\u03bcg), DMAb-BiSPA (300\u2009\u03bcg), or an unrelated control DMAb-DVSF3 (300\u2009\u03bcg) that targets dengue virus (DENV)20. We also included a positive control group in which mice received protein MEDI3902 IgG (2\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) 1 day before challenge. Randomly selected animals from DMAb-\u03b1PcrV-treated and DMAb-BiSPA-treated animals were euthanized to monitor DMAb expression levels in serum at the time of challenge, as well as to evaluate the potency of the expressed DMAbs. As indicated in Fig.\u00a04a, both monospecific DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and bispecific DMAb-BiSPA exhibited median titers of approximately 16 and 8\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121, respectively, when quantifying total human IgG from serum. We further evaluated the potency of in vivo expressed DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and DMAb-BiSPA by quantifying antibody expression based on the anti-cytotoxic activity from serum. No difference was observed in the quantification methods, indicating that in vivo expressed monospecific and bispecific DMAb-IgGs are fully functional and equivalent in activity in comparison to bioprocessed IgG (Fig.\u00a04a). The remaining animals in each group were then challenged with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa by intranasal inoculation followed by monitoring of survival for 6 days post infection (144\u2009h). Animals receiving the control DMAb-DVSF3 succumbed to infection within 24\u201355\u2009h. In contrast, approximately 94% of animals (15/16) that received either DMAb-\u03b1PcrV or DMAb-BiSPA survived challenge (Fig.\u00a04b, Log-rank test p\u2009<\u20090.0001 in comparison with DMAb-DVSF3). As expected, all the positive control animals receiving MEDI3902 IgG (2\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) survived challenge.

These results were consistent with the quantification of expressed DMAb-BiSPA in serum from these animals, in which the serum protein concentration of DMAb-BiSPA decreased with decreasing amounts of electroporated DNA (Fig.\u00a04d).Fig. 4Functionality and protection by DMAb-\u03b1PcrV and DMAb-BiSPA in mice. a BALB/c mice were administered 300\u2009\u00b5g of DMAb-\u03b1PcrV, DMAb-BiSPA, or MEDI3902 IgG (2\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121). n\u2009=\u20095 mice/group.

Lungs, spleen, and kidneys were assayed 24\u2009h post challenge with P. aeruginosa followed by quantification of colony forming units (CFUs) in each tissue. A significant reduction (Kruskal\u2013Wallis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test) in CFU lung burden was observed with DMAb-BiSPA but not DMAb-\u03b1PcrV-treated animals (Fig.\u00a05a). Importantly, bacterial burden in the lungs of DMAb-BiSPA-treated animals were similar to the lung burden observed from mice treated with protein MEDI3902 IgG and both anti-Pseudomonas DMAbs reduced dissemination of bacteria to the spleen and kidneys when compared to the control DMAb-DVSF3 (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition, DMAb-\u03b1PcrV, DMAb-BiSPA, and MEDI3902 IgG were effective in preventing pulmonary edema in infected animals, as measured by lung weight, compared to control DMAb-DVSF3-treated mice (Fig.\u00a05b). Consistent with these results, proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 as well as the chemokine KC/GRO (Fig.\u00a05c) were also reduced in anti-Pseudomonas DMAb-treated and protein IgG-treated mice vs. the control DMAb-DVSF3. Serum IgG levels were compared between uninfected animals and infected animals 24\u2009h post PA 6077 challenge (Fig.\u00a05d).

Further last-resort antibiotic regimens, such as colistin, are associated with high toxicity in humans21, 22 and there is the potential for the bacterium to acquire further anti-microbial resistance23\u201325. Therefore, alternative and adjunctive strategies to reduce these risks would be highly advantageous. We therefore evaluated the potential application of DMAb-BiSPA treatment in combination with MEM. For these experiments, we utilized a subtherapeutic dose of MEM (2.3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) to simulate the inadequate drug exposure encountered in patients infected with a resistant bacterium, and a subtherapeutic dose of DMAb-BiSPA (100\u2009\u00b5g, identified in Fig.\u00a04c). Combining these subtherapeutic dosages resulted in 67% survival compared with 10% in animals that received DMAb-BiSPA alone (Log rank test p\u2009=\u20090.026, Fig.\u00a07). Control mice that received MEM alone or the DMAb-DVSF3 did not survive lethal challenge. Taken together, our results support the potential application of DMAb treatment as either a standalone treatment or in combination with existing antibiotic regimens. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that DMAb administration functions similarly to purified IgG mAbs and can mediate enhanced protective activity when combined with standard of care antibiotic treatment regimens.Fig. 7DMAb combination with antibiotic regimen. a BALB/c mice were injected with control DMAb-DVSF3 (100\u2009\u00b5g), saline\u2009+\u2009MEM (2.3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121), DMAb-BiSPA (100\u2009\u00b5g), or DMAb-BiSPA (100\u2009\u00b5g)\u2009+\u2009MEM (2.3\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) and then challenged with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa 6077.

                "The global health and economic impact of antimicrobial resistant infections is staggering and there is a compelling need to investigate novel strategies to prevent or treat these infections. Over 2 million cases of community-acquired and hospital-acquired resistant infections are reported each year in the United States2. A large percentage of these infections are caused by ESKAPE pathogens and broad-spectrum antibiotics are frequently administered as last-resort treatment26. However, antibiotic usage is often associated with negative side effects, including disruption of the beneficial microflora and potential for the spread of cross-resistance in non-targeted bacteria. Furthermore, inappropriate usage of antibiotics in humans or for agricultural purposes is likely a contributing factor to global resistance rates27. This growing predicament and the lack of novel mechanism antibiotics in the pharmaceutical pipeline has fostered the development of alternative antimicrobial strategies such as pathogen-specific mAbs. We previously reported on the derivation of a monospecific anti-PcrV mAb (V2L2MD) and bispecific anti-PcrV/Psl mAb MEDI3902 that confer potent protective activity against one of the ESKAPE pathogens, P. aeruginosa 16, 17. Using these clones as model molecules, we encoded the IgG heavy and light chain sequences into a synthetic DNA vector to test the feasibility of plasmid DNA delivery (DMAb) as an alternative mode of direct delivery of mAb in vivo to overcome some of the limitations of traditional mAb manufacturing and delivery impeding broader use.",
                "In the current study, we demonstrated that mAbs against P. aeruginosa can be encoded in synthetic DNA vectors, DMAbs, and produced in vivo by skeletal muscle. The anti-Pseudomonas DMAbs bound effectively to therapeutic targets and were protective in a mouse model of lethal pneumonia caused by an aggressive P. aeruginosa strain. We identified that a single dose of DMAb is transiently expressed for 3\u20134 months and protection against lethal infection is comparable to treatment of mice with purified IgG. This result supports the possibility of long-term mAb administration, as DMAbs can be continuously expressed from muscle until the plasmid is eventually lost. In addition to routine administration, another foreseeable advantage for anti-P. aeruginosa DMAbs would be for high-risk patients with recurring infections related to chronic illnesses or implanted devices, where DMAbs may reduce the need for extended antibiotic regimens. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DMAbs can also function synergistically with a commonly used antibiotic, MEM. The synergistic effect of DMAb and antibiotic combination suggests that this strategy could have potential in reducing antibiotic treatment regimens, thereby reducing the length of antibiotic exposure in patients. This adjunctive activity is equivalent to that observed with protein IgG in previous studies18. Although we did not evaluate DMAb activity against a panel of P. aeruginosa bacterial strains, the experiments outlined in this manuscript demonstrate that DMAb is functionally equivalent to protein IgG. All bioprocessed anti-Pseudomonal IgG mAbs (anti-Psl, anti-PcrV, and MEDI3902) have been previously shown to be protective against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates derived from diverse serotypes, multiple T3S phenotypes (cytotoxic vs. invasive strain; ExoU+, ExoS\u2212; ExoU\u2212, ExoS+, respectively), and multiple infection sites16\u201318, 28, 29.",
                "The field of mAb engineering is evolving dynamically and DMAb delivery offers an additional strategy to help transport biologically functional mAbs rapidly in vivo. In addition to obvious clinical benefits, in vivo expression of non-traditional bispecific mAb isoforms, as presented here, emphasizes the versatility of muscle to be engaged as protein production factories. Importantly, DMAb expression is transient, with similar efficacy to other therapeutic deliveries. It may be possible to develop an inducible system that will eliminate the DNA plasmid when it is no longer needed. Alternatively, DMAb DNA can potentially be re-administered indefinitely as there are no associated anti-vector responses, allowing for long-term therapy through repeat administration30\u201332. We believe that DMAb delivery represents a significant advancement not only for mAb therapy and DNA-delivery technology, but also for novel pathogen-specific treatment approaches to enhance host immunity.",
                "Recently delivery of DNA-encoded antibodies that target Her2 in a mouse model of human breast cancer carcinoma33 has been reported. This study demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy comparable to protein IgG, further supporting the concept that a gene-encoded mAb can have functionality. To our knowledge, our study is the first demonstration of DNA-encoded mAb delivery that is protective against a bacterial target and the first delivery of an engineered IgG isoform. Early studies with DNA plasmid-encoded antibodies demonstrated feasibility but exhibited low-IgG expression in serum34, 35. Our group previously demonstrated the protective efficacy of DMAbs targeting viral infections, showing rapid protection against chikungunya36 and DENV infections20. The DMAb-targeting DENV did not promote antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. These two infectious disease models did not require high serum IgG levels; however, optimized DMAb formulations to increase expression levels are desirable so as to provide extended coverage after a single DMAb administration. Toward this end, we sought to optimize serum DMAb expression levels for our efforts against P. aeruginosa (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). This work included the inclusion of hyaluronidase into the formulation regimen, which allowed for greater IgG expression from the treated muscle.",
                "Although further study is required for translation to humans, DMAbs are a step toward enabling routine delivery of mAb, with the potential for increasing accessibility to diverse communities worldwide. Dose translation in larger animals and humans will be important to address in future studies, particularly understanding DNA dose limitations during DMAb administration. This includes investigating different delivery and formulation optimizations that will enhance DNA expression in vivo. One strategy may be to employ other extracellular matrix enzymes to facilitate DNA entry into muscle cells37. Further study in non-human primates may help to understand the threshold for DNA dosage and impact on pharmacokinetic levels. Additional studies evaluating the glycosylation patterns of human IgG DMAbs produced in muscle would be beneficial to compare with bioprocessed protein IgG; however, in the context of the current study there was no difference in functionality between DMAb and its protein IgG counterpart.",
                "In conclusion, our work described herein could be of significance for the treatment of AMR infections, particularly against ESKAPE pathogens that are refractory to many broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens. The DMAb strategy is versatile and can deliver monospecific IgGs against multiple antigenic targets as well as novel bispecific IgGs. The sustained serum mAb trough levels produced by a single dose of DMAb are consistent with functionality and protective levels afforded by bioprocessed protein IgG in vivo. The rapid development of this platform and prolonged transient expression from muscle are favorable in comparison with protein IgG mAb regimens as it could enable less frequent mAb administration. Furthermore, DMAb-encoding DNA is temperature stable allowing for transport, long-term storage, and administration to broader populations. These attractive features combined with the safety profile of DNA delivery in humans, support further DMAb studies in larger animal models as a pathogen-specific approach to targeting infectious diseases and other potential therapeutic targets."
