### EXAMPLE 1

- outline synthesis of CRM-FEN conjugate
- prepare N-Phenylethylpiperidin-4-one
- prepare 1-Phenethyl-N-phenylpiperidin-4-amine
- prepare Methyl 5-oxo-5((1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)(phenyl)amino)
- prepare 5-Oxo-5-((1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)(phenyl)amino)pentano
- conjugate Fentanyl-CRM
- evaluate FEN-CRM conjugates by SDS-PAGE/Western blot
- vaccinate mice and evaluate anti-fentanyl antibodies by ELISA
- present experimental design
- show increased anti-FEN IgG levels with dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants
- demonstrate high levels of FEN-specific antibody secreting cells with dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants
- show elevated anti-FEN IgG levels and ASCs with mucosal routes of administration
- assess anti-nociceptive effects of FEN using tail flick assay
- present nociception tests in male and female Sprague Dawley rats
- show complete blockade of FEN's analgesic effects in vaccinated rats
- present hot plate assay data for male rats
- present hot plate assay data for female rats
- show complete blockade of FEN's analgesic effects in female rats
- present lethality data for male rats
- show enduring anti-FEN antibody levels at 6 months post-initial vaccination
- present data on fentanyl levels in brain and serum samples
