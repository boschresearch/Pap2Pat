    "date": "2021-05-13",
    "abstract": "Fentanyl is a major contributor to the devastating increase in overdose deaths from substance use disorders (SUD). A vaccine targeting fentanyl could be a powerful immunotherapeutic. Here, we evaluated adjuvant and delivery strategies for conjugate antigen vaccination with fentanyl-based haptens. We tested adjuvants derived from the heat-labile toxin of E. coli including dmLT and LTA1 by intramuscular, sublingual or intranasal delivery. Our results show anti-fentanyl serum antibodies and antibody secreting cells in the bone-marrow after vaccination with highest levels observed with an adjuvant (alum, dmLT, or LTA1). Vaccine adjuvanted with LTA1 or dmLT elicited the highest levels of anti-fentanyl antibodies, whereas alum achieved highest levels against the carrier protein. Vaccination with sublingual dmLT or intranasal LTA1 provided the most robust blockade of fentanyl-induced analgesia and CNS penetration correlating strongly to anti-FEN IgA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates dmLT or LTA1 adjuvant as well as mucosal delivery may be attractive strategies for improving the efficacy of vaccines against SUD.",

                "The United States is in the midst of a nationwide opioid crisis, with an estimated 2.1 million individuals suffering from an opioid use disorder (OUD)1. Particularly alarming are the increasing fatal overdoses resulting from illicit fentanyl (FEN). Higher incidence of drug overdose deaths was proportionally associated with the number of FEN seizures in a given community2. FEN is believed to specifically account for nearly 30,000 of the 50,000 deaths involving opioids annually, due to its high potency, ease of manufacturing, and/or addition to other illicit drugs unknowing to the user3\u20135. Since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there is new evidence that FEN use and opioid overdoses may also be increasing6. FEN and FEN-analogs rapidly penetrate the central nervous system and are 50\u2013100 times more potent than heroin and morphine respectively. Because of this potency as well as its half-life, higher or repeated doses of the mu opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (Narcan\u00a9) are needed to be administered quickly to reverse lethal overdoses7.",
                "One option to help combat this opioid epidemic is vaccination. A vaccine specifically targeting illicit opioid(s) could attenuate the reinforcing effects of FEN and prevent overdose deaths by preventing the drug from penetrating the CNS, particularly in individuals recovering from OUD during critical periods when relapse is especially common. Such a vaccination strategy would induce serum antibodies that diminish drug activity by assembling an antibody-drug complex that is too large to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, but not prevent other pain medications (e.g., tramadol, morphine) from working. Vaccines for substance use disorders (SUDs) have been under development for decades, including for cocaine, nicotine, heroin, amphetamines, and other synthetic opioids but without commercial success and FDA approval8\u201313. As observed with cocaine and nicotine vaccines in Phase III clinical trials, a lack of sustainable antibody levels and consistent levels of antibodies in vaccinated subjects has been a persistent problem14\u201318. Yet subjects who attained high levels of antibodies against nicotine or cocaine following vaccination showed significantly reduced drug use compared to those that only achieved low levels of antibodies and the placebo group14,19.",
                "FEN is not naturally immunogenic, so the drug must be conjugated to a protein in order to create an immunogenic vaccine antigen. Recent animal studies with various opioid conjugate immunogens have demonstrated development of antibodies to FEN or heroin resulting in decreasing potency of heroin and FEN distribution to the brain after experimental exposure, reducing the drug-induced antinociception (or blocking of pain)9\u201313,20\u201324. However, a frequent problem of these conjugate vaccines is still short duration of immunity and/or insufficient antibody magnitudes even with an added adjuvant. As recently reviewed25, no single adjuvant has emerged as ideal for vaccines against SUDs, though alum, TLR-based agonist, or combinations thereof have been tested. Alum, or aluminum salts, are the most commonly used adjuvants in licensed vaccines; evaluations of alum in drug abuse or addiction vaccines thus far has had limited success in inducing an enduring antibody response13,25\u201327. Few studies have shown efficacy for routes other than injected delivery (e.g., by intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal routes), with a few exceptions in vaccines for cocaine28. Mucosal vaccination has an advantage of needle-free delivery, lack of injection-related infections, possibility of non-medical personnel administration or self-administration, and induction of robust systemic and mucosal immunity29\u201331. In addition, mucosal vaccination can alter the quality of antibody isotypes, particularly IgA, and may better protect against mucosal drug exposures, (e.g., snorting or smoking), than parenteral vaccination.",
                "A newer class of adjuvants being developed are derived from heat-labile enterotoxins from E. coli (LT) or V. cholerae. These proteins have an enzymatic A-subunit critical for adjuvant effects32\u201335 that ADP-ribosylates Gs\u03b1, leading to irreversible adenylate cyclase activation and accumulation of intracellular cAMP. dmLT or LT(R192G/L211A) is the most advanced and clinically relevant protein from this adjuvant family36. dmLT improves parenteral and mucosal immunity to bacterial and viral antigens following a variety of routes in animal models, including IM and sublingual (SL) delivery routes37\u201343 and has been tested in a number of recent human clinical trials44\u201346. In addition, dmLT enhanced antibody responses to conjugate antigens using a polysaccharide-protein conjugate against V. cholerae47. We have also developed a B-subunit free adjuvant called LTA1 based on the A1 domain39,48,49. LTA1 was specifically developed for safe intranasal (IN) use to overcome the risk of Bell\u2019s palsy with AB5 LT proteins48,50,51. Like dmLT, LTA1 also activates antigen presenting cells49 and stimulates immunity to parenteral injection of vaccine antigen52. However, the ability of dmLT, LTA1, or any bacterial-enterotoxin based adjuvant for vaccines targeting substances associated with use disorders has not been explored (though the cholera toxin binding B-subunit has been used as a carrier for cocaine vaccines16).",
                "The objective of this study was to test whether LT-based adjuvants can enhance the efficacy of a candidate FEN vaccine. To test this, we evaluated two FEN conjugate immunogens in combination with dmLT, LTA1, or alum adjuvants and administered to mice by IM, SL, or IN routes."

These formulations were delivered by prime/boost IM immunization to mice (week 0, 4) with sample analyses performed two weeks after the second immunization (week 6, Fig. 1a) compared to na\u00efve mice. We observed a statistically significant increase in serum antibodies to carrier antigen, using ELISA plates coated with BSA, as well as specific to FEN, using ELISA plates coated with FEN-TT, in all vaccinated mice compared to na\u00efve mice; however, this was highest when dmLT was included in the vaccine formulation (Fig. 1b\u2013c, F-statistics and degrees of freedom reported in Supplemental Table 1). The majority of induced anti-FEN antibodies were an IgG1 isotype, with some IgG2a, but not IgA or IgM (Fig. 1d\u2013e). To test if serum antibodies corresponded with an increased number of antigen-specific ASCs, bone-marrow and spleen tissues were also analyzed for anti-FEN ASCs by ELISPOT. We found a statistically significant increase in the number of anti-FEN IgG ASCs in FEN-BSA + dmLT vaccinated mice compared with FEN-BSA vaccinated mice in either tissue (Fig. 1f\u2013g). This was maximal in bone-marrow, where memory B-cells and long-lived plasma cells typically reside.Fig. 1Immune responses to intramuscular immunization with FEN-BSA are enhanced with dmLT adjuvant.Groups of Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20094) were left na\u00efve or immunized intramuscularly with 8\u2009\u03bcg FEN-BSA\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u03bcg dmLT on weeks 0 and 4.

                        "Based on promising results using the FEN-BSA antigen above and published FEN hapten conjugation strategies13, we prepared a FEN-CRM197 (FEN-CRM) antigen (Supplemental Fig. 1). The E. coli-expressed CRM197 protein, or EcoCRM, is a low-cost manufactured protein derived from detoxified diphtheria toxin53 with fewer complications reported from pre-existing immunity compared to other common carrier proteins54,55. It has successfully been used in a recent pre-clinical heroin vaccine study26. To test the efficacy of the FEN-CRM antigen as well as adjuvant combinations in generation of anti-FEN immunity, we next immunized groups of mice with 5\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM alone or admixed with 0.1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT, 5\u2009\u03bcg LTA1, or absorbed 1:1 with 2% alhydrogel (alum). Since responses to substance abuse vaccines have not been optimal with alum13, we aimed to have higher responses with dmLT or LTA1 adjuvanted vaccination than observed with the alum group. Formulations were delivered by prime/boost IM to mice (weeks 0 and 3) followed by immunologic analyses at two-weeks (week 5) or 6 weeks later (week 9, Fig. 2a). We observed a statistically significant increase in serum antibodies to CRM197 carrier antigen in all adjuvanted groups compared to antigen-alone vaccination, which was highest in the alum adjuvanted group (Fig. 2a\u2013b). In contrast, antibody responses specific to FEN, determined using ELISA plates coated with FEN-BSA or FEN-TT, were highest in dmLT and LTA1 adjuvanted groups. These observed serum antibody responses were evident even 6 weeks after the boost (week 9). As before, we also evaluated vaccinated animals for number of anti-FEN ASCs in the bone-marrow (tissue selected based on Fig. 1 experiments). We observed ASCs in all groups that were vaccinated with FEN-CRM antigen, with significantly higher levels in dmLT and LTA1 adjuvanted groups compared with antigen alone, but not in the alum adjuvanted group (Fig. 2d\u2013e). Evaluation of memory B cells in bone-marrow or spleen, using 5 days of ex vivo expansion and differentiation into ASC with mitogens using standard methods56, revealed only the LTA1 adjuvanted group in bone-marrow tissue exhibited significant memory B cells after vaccination compared to all other FEN-CRM groups (Fig. 2f). Similar findings were also observed with a shorter time between vaccination boosters and a smaller dose of antigen (Supplemental Fig. 2).Fig. 2Immune responses to prime/boost intramuscular immunization with FEN-CRM197 are enhanced in magnitude and longevity with dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants.Groups of Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135) were left na\u00efve or immunized IM with 5\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u2009150\u2009\u03bcg alum, 0.1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT, or 5\u2009\u03bcg LTA1 on weeks 0 and 3.

To test how an additional booster immunization would change the magnitude of immunity post vaccination, we repeated our immunizations from above (Fig. 2) except on a prime/boost/boost schedule on weeks 0, 3, and 6, with sample collection on week 8 (Fig. 3a). As before, FEN-CRM alone or adjuvanted with alum, dmLT or LTA1 resulted in serum antibodies and ASCs to CRM carrier or FEN (Fig. 3b\u2013e). Immune responses to carrier were more similar between adjuvant groups (than with two immunizations in Fig. 2), but higher levels of anti-FEN serum IgG, IgG1, or IgG2a or anti-FEN IgG ASCs were observed in dmLT and LTA1 groups. No clear differences between dmLT and LTA1 groups were observed in serum antibody analyses; however, the dmLT group had the higher number of IgG ASCs when compared to FEN-CRM vaccination alone (Fig. 3e).Fig. 3Immune responses to prime/boost/boost intramuscular FEN-CRM197 immunization are enhanced in magnitude with dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants.Groups of Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135) were left na\u00efve or immunized IM with 5\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u2009150\u2009\u03bcg alum, 0.1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT, or 5\u2009\u03bcg LTA1 on weeks 0, 3, and 6.

                        "While our studies thus far utilized IM delivery, both dmLT and LTA1 are unique adjuvants because they are also highly effective by mucosal delivery. Past animal and human studies have shown that immunization by sublingual (SL) delivery with dmLT plus antigen directly to the mucosal tissue under the tongue37,43,57\u201362 or animal studies with immunization by intranasal (IN) delivery with LTA1 + antigen to the nasal epithelium39,48 are safe and promote vaccine immunity. No mucosal vaccinations have previously been reported with OUD vaccines, but presumably could be advantageous for outpatient or self-delivery immunization schemes, or to counteract intranasal (snorting) or intrapulmonary (smoking) delivery of opioids. To test whether mucosal delivery alone or with adjuvant could be effective as booster immunizations, we performed additional animal vaccinations selecting antigen/adjuvant doses based on previous studies48,52. Mice were first primed by IM delivery as before (e.g., Figs. 2\u20133) with 5\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM alone or admixed with 0.1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT or 5\u2009\u03bcg of LTA1. This was followed by booster vaccinations with 9\u201310\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM alone or admixed with 5\u2009\u03bcg dmLT by SL delivery or 5\u2009\u03bcg LTA1 by IN delivery on weeks 3 and 6. Sample collection was performed on week 8 (Fig. 4a). FEN-CRM immunization with mucosal boosting with and without dmLT or LTA1 adjuvants resulted in serum antibodies and ASCs to CRM carrier and/or FEN (Fig. 4b\u2013e). Higher levels of anti-FEN serum IgG, IgG1, and anti-FEN IgG ASCs were observed in dmLT SL and LTA1 IN groups, with highest levels in the latter. LTA1 IN group also had significant levels of anti-FEN serum IgA, but less IgG2a than the IN (no adjuvant) group (Fig. 4c). Significant levels of IgA ASCs in the bone-marrow were not observed (Fig. 4e). Similar findings were also observed with SL booster vaccination with FEN-BSA with and without dmLT, with serum IgA also being detected in this experiment (Supplemental Fig. 3).Fig. 4Immune responses to FEN-CRM197 can be generated by sublingual or intranasal booster immunizations containing either dmLT or LTA1 adjuvants.Groups of Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20096) were left na\u00efve or primed by 5\u2009\u03bcg FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u03bcg of dmLT or 5\u2009\u03bcg of LTA1 by IM delivery.

                        "Immunologic analyses of FEN conjugate vaccinations require a different FEN hapten conjugate to evaluate the immune responses. Thus far, we had observed slight differences in vaccination outcomes depending upon specific assay or coating antigen, with higher levels of antibodies when FEN-TT coating antigen was used (Figs. 1\u20133). To better compare the results of these assays, data were compiled and compared from IM experiments (Fig. 5a) or from IM prime with mucosal boosts (Fig. 5b, c). We observed that all anti-FEN IgG comparisons (e.g., FEN-BSA ELISA vs FEN-TT ELISA vs FEN-TT ELISPOT) were significantly and positively correlated using Spearman\u2019s correlation test (r values between 0.52 and 0.76). However, limit of detection, background (estimated from na\u00efve groups), and overall magnitude of observed responses were assay specific. These data indicate that the selection of a FEN-hapten conjugate for ELISA analyses can impact quantification of anti-FEN serum IgG antibodies. For anti-FEN IgA comparisons (e.g., FEN-BSA ELISA vs FEN-TT ELISPOT) serum antibodies and bone-marrow ASCs were not significantly correlated (Fig. 5c), indicating that another tissue area likely related to mucosal vaccination is serving as the niche for IgA ASCs. Importantly, these comparisons indicate that serum IgG antibodies are likely being produced by the ASCs found in the bone-marrow, cells critical for maintenance of antibodies in systemic circulation; however, circulating IgA antibodies are likely being produced by ASCs in mucosal tissue or draining secondary lymphoid organs yet to be identified.Fig. 5Significant correlations between anti-FEN IgG antibody analyses by serum ELISAs and ASC ELISPOT.a Correlations between indicated IgG ELISAs or ELISPOT results with coating antigen indicated in parenthesis using compiled data from FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u2009adjuvants IM prime/boost or prime/boost/boost experiments. b Correlations between indicated IgG ELISAs or ELISPOT results with coating antigen indicated in parenthesis using compiled data from FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u2009adjuvants prime IM and mucosal (SL or IN) booster experiments. c Correlations between indicated IgA ELISAs or ELISPOT results with coating antigen indicated in parenthesis using compiled data from FEN-CRM\u2009\u00b1\u2009adjuvants prime IM and mucosal (SL or IN) booster experiments.

This higher dose of alum was chosen to improve upon the anti-FEN antibody responses observed with the 150\u2009\u03bcg alum used in Figs. 2\u20134. This required a formulation volume of 100\u2009\u03bcl for the 1500\u2009\u03bcg alum group (delivered by 50\u2009\u03bcl injection in both hind limbs), whereas all other IM injections were delivered at 20\u2009\u03bcl as used previously. We also included mucosal booster groups (as in Fig. 4) including dmLT IM+SL+SL and LTA1 IM+IN+IN. All mice were vaccinated on weeks 0, 3, and 6. Four-weeks after the last boost, we conducted nociception tests using tail flick and hotplate assays in mice using challenges with 30 and 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg fentanyl during weeks 10\u201312 (Fig. 6a). There was a one-week washout period between FEN test doses. These tests were chosen to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines in reducing opioid-induced brain and spinal antinociception effects to provide a measure of vaccine potency. Both assays have been extensively used in identification of lead opioid vaccines12,13. All mice developed serum anti-FEN IgG antibodies at weeks 6, 8, and 10; the highest levels of anti-FEN IgG were observed in the alum IM, 1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT, and LTA1 IN groups (Fig. 6b). Protection from FEN-induced antinociception was greatest in the LTA1 IN group, followed by the dmLT SL and 1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT IM groups (Fig. 6c, d). We observed similar protection from FEN brain penetration, with the majority of injected FEN remaining in the serum unable to penetrate the CNS (Fig. 6e). While FEN brain distribution and serum IgG antibodies at week 8 were significantly correlated (Fig. 6f), protection from antinociception (tail flick assay during 100\u2009\u03bcg/kg fentanyl challenge) was not. This may be attributed to a limited sample size or the spinal cord mechanism of tail flick analgesia and our measurement of brain, but not spinal cord levels of FEN, which can differ. Regardless, these studies reveal that both dmLT and LTA1 adjuvant by parenteral and mucosal delivery provide protection against FEN challenge.Fig. 6Reduction in fentanyl-induced antinociception and brain tissue distribution in dmLT and LTA1 vaccinated animals compared to alum or antigen alone groups.Groups of Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20095\u201320) were left na\u00efve or immunized on weeks 0, 3, and 6 with FEN-CRM IM or with adjuvant and route combinations as performed previously.

                        "To determine if we could better understand the correlates of protection in our challenge model, we evaluated serum from our protection study (e.g., Fig. 7) for anti-FEN IgG antibody affinity and antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgA). Both antibody isotypes and binding affinity can improve drug binding and sequestration of opioids from the brain63. We observed that both adjuvant selection and route impacted the quality of the antibody responses to FEN (Fig. 7a\u2013c). In particular, the alum group resulted in only anti-FEN IgG1, whereas dmLT and LTA1 adjuvant groups also resulted in IgG2a with maximal levels in the 1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT IM group. The group that received alum also had significantly skewed serum IgG1/IgG2a ratio (Fig. 7c). As seen previously highest levels of anti-FEN IgA were observed in mucosal booster groups, including dmLT IM+SL+SL and LTA1 IM+IN+IN. Next, we correlated these anti-FEN antibody affinity and isotype responses from immunized groups to each FEN challenge outcome using Spearman\u2019s correlation test (Supplemental Fig. 4). Anti-FEN IgG2a shows moderate correlation to serum FEN post-challenge (P\u2009=\u20090.07, r\u2009=\u20090.38), and IgG binding affinity demonstrated a modest inverse relation with % MPE hotplate antinociception (P\u2009=\u20090.06, r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.28). Improved anti-FEN IgG2a isotype class switching and IgG binding affinity appeared to be the major driver of protective responses in higher vs lower dose dmLT IM immunizations with the expected inverse relationship to %MPE (respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.02 and r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.44 or, P\u2009=\u20090.03 and r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41 Fig. 7d). In contrast, anti-FEN IgA was significantly related to all FEN challenge outcomes measured (P\u2009=\u20090.03 to <0.001), including brain fentanyl (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.78) and tail flick antinociception (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.42; Fig. 7e and Supplemental Fig. 4). These results confirm the importance of IgG2a isotype, but also reveal a previously unknown role for anti-FEN IgA in FEN analgesic effects, which was maximally induced by mucosal boosting with LTA1 IN or dmLT SL vaccination.Fig. 7Anti-FEN antibody affinity, IgG2a, and IgA isotypes contributed to protection from fentanyl challenge in dmLT and LTA1 immunized animals.Serum samples from fentanyl challenge experiments were further characterized for anti-FEN immunity. a IgG antibody binding affinity calculated as % IgG binding to FEN-TT in the presence of a chaotropic agent (week 6). b Compiled serum anti-FEN (FEN-TT) serum IgG1 (week 8), IgG2a (week 8), IgA (week 10) ELISA from tailbleeds. c Ratio of serum anti-FEN (FEN-TT) IgG1/IgG2a.

                "An effective FEN vaccine could provide a valuable immunotherapy to attenuate FEN\u2019s physiological, behavioral, and reinforcing effects by preventing the drug from penetrating the CNS. To achieve this, vaccine studies have strived to produce large quantities of FEN-specific antibodies with high binding affinity. In this study, we found that FEN-carrier vaccination with combinations of dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants delivered by IM, IN, or SL routes produced high antibody titers and had significant protective effects against FEN challenge, superior to alum adjuvant. This is the only report of any enterotoxin-derived adjuvant improving efficacy of an opioid vaccine or any substance abuse vaccine. This is also the only report identifying mucosal booster vaccination and generation of IgA antibody isotypes having a significant role in the efficacy of an opioid vaccination strategy.",
                "Administration of the FEN-CRM vaccine with dmLT or LTA1 using IM delivery evoked a potent and long-lasting immune response, with sufficient antibody levels lasting six weeks post-immunization to produce significant blockade of FEN behavioral effects. In spite of being smaller than the typical BSA carrier and having only a lower haptenization ratio, CRM197 was an effective carrier protein, showing results similar to recent studies using CRM197 for a morphine or oxycodone vaccine20,26 and recently for FEN vaccination64. Minor differences were observed between dmLT and LTA1 depending upon number of booster immunizations and specific analyses performed (Figs. 2\u20133); however, these adjuvants were consistently superior to the alum adjuvant comparison groups (Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 7). Both of these adjuvants broadened the immune response to target the FEN hapten more rapidly (e.g., after one booster) than the more commonly used alum adjuvant12,13,23,25, and alum generated more rapid and higher responses to the carrier protein antigen BSA or CRM197. We chose dmLT IM for challenge experiments, given dmLT\u2019s advanced status in clinical trials36 and slightly higher levels of anti-FEN IgG ASCs after three doses (Fig. 3). We observed greater protection from FEN challenge with 1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT over 0.1\u2009\u03bcg dmLT. This robust attenuation of FEN\u2019s analgesic effects was likely driven by the improved FEN antibody binding and induction of IgG2a isotypes in the higher dose group (Fig. 7). IgG2a has been previously identified as superior to IgG1 in protection against opioids, including a morphine vaccine in mice depleted or lacking in IL-4 cytokine, which reduced class switching to IgG1 with alum adjuvanted vaccination63. In conclusion, dmLT may be a superior adjuvant for opioid use disorder when multiple immunizations are provided by parenteral injection due to higher IgG2a isotype generation and FEN antibody binding.",
                "Given the nature of dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants, we also tested mucosal booster immunizations. dmLT has successfully been delivered by sublingual vaccination43,52,58,61,62 and LTA1 by intranasal vaccination39,48. In addition, within the intended recipient population of a FEN vaccine, many individuals take daily buccal buprenorphine (a pill dissolving between the gums and the cheek) to manage opioid dependence relapse and cravings65. The addition of a self-delivered mucosal or intranasal booster vaccine within this treatment context could be advantageous. We observed high levels of anti-FEN immunity in the animals receiving mucosal boosters, including dmLT SL or LTA1 IN, as well as the best blockade of FEN analgesia and brain tissue distribution. The LTA1 IN group achieved the best overall protection; however, despite these responses, anti-FEN IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and antibody binding affinity were similar to the adjuvanted IM booster groups (Figs. 6\u20137). One difference we were able to identify was induction of anti-FEN IgA in these mucosal booster groups. IgA levels also correlated to protection from parenteral FEN challenge better than any other antibody measure assayed and this relationship was dose-dependent (Figs. 6f and 7e, Supplemental Fig. 4). At this point, it is unclear if serum IgA or secretory IgA (unmeasured) play direct roles in protection from challenge or if serum IgA is just a surrogate of another protective responses. Regardless, this is the only such report of IgA related to opioid vaccination and drug protection. IgA antibodies have been reported after cocaine and nicotine intranasal vaccines that protected animals from corresponding drug challenges28,66,67. IgA has also long been appreciated for high affinity binding to toxins and microbes at mucosal tissue, where most IgA secreting plasma cells reside. This is likely the case in our study, where serum IgA level did not correlate to IgA ASC in the bone-marrow (Fig. 5c). It is interesting to note that IgA is also found in cerebral spinal fluid of healthy humans in both monomeric and dimeric forms68. Future evaluations into if or how IgA could be more protective against FEN parenteral challenge (or smoked FEN inhalation) than IgG subclasses are warranted to better understand this phenomenon.",
                "In our ELISA analyses, we observed strong detection of anti-FEN antibodies through FEN-BSA or FEN-TT conjugate antigens, but with slight variability between assays (Fig. 5). Serum IgG levels against FEN were higher with FEN-TT than with FEN-BSA coating antigens, indicating that quantification of anti-FEN immunity must be considered in light of the differences in sensitivity and quantification observed in assays using carrier antigens as detection systems for antibodies. For example, SL dmLT groups had more appreciable levels of anti-FEN serum IgA when FEN-TT was used as coating antigen than with FEN-BSA coating antigen (Figs. 4 and 7, Supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, we reported that serum IgG (by ELISA) significantly correlated with the number of IgG-secreting ASCs found in the bone-marrow, both of which were maximally enhanced in dmLT or LTA1 adjuvant groups. Similarly, flow cytometry studies have shown that ASC B cells at 14 days post immunization correlated with vaccine efficacy against opioids, with adjuvant-dependent induction of these ASC and germinal center formation (where B-cell clonal expansion, differentiation, and maturation take place)63,69.",
                "In conclusion, we report that dmLT and LTA1 adjuvants enhance immunogenicity of an anti-FEN conjugate vaccine and promote a robust blockade of FEN-induced analgesia. We observed strong evidence for a greater protective effect with vaccination that included mucosal booster immunizations with subsequent induction of IgA. Future investigation and development of a FEN vaccine with these adjuvants and combinatorial or mucosal delivery routes are warranted, including the duration of vaccine-mediated blocking of FEN analgesia, respiratory depression, other toxicity or reinforcing effects and comparisons or combinations with current FDA-approved pharmacotherapies (e.g., buprenorphine). Furthermore, in light of our findings we anticipate that combination of a dmLT or LTA1 opioid vaccination with antigens for other substances associated with use disorders, including cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine, could benefit the design of new immunotherapies against SUDs."
