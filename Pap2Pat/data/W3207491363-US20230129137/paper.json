    "title": "TT-10\u2013loaded nanoparticles promote cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair in a mouse model of myocardial infarction",
    "date": "2021-10-22",
    "abstract": "The meager regenerative capacity of adult mammalian hearts appears to be driven by the proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes; thus, strategies targeting mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation, such as the Hippo/Yes-associated protein (Hippo/Yap) pathway, could lead to the development of promising therapies for heart disease. The pharmacological product TT-10 increases cardiomyocyte proliferation by upregulating nuclear Yap levels. When intraperitoneal injections of TT-10 were administered to infarcted mouse hearts, the treatment promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and was associated with declines in infarct size 1 week after administration, but cardiac function worsened at later time points. Here, we investigated whether encapsulating TT-10 into poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles (NPs) before administration could extend the duration of TT-10 delivery and improve the potency of TT-10 for myocardial repair. TT-10 was released from the TT-10-loaded NPs for up to 4 weeks in vitro, and intramyocardial injections of TT-10-delivered NPs stably improved cardiac function from week 1 to week 4 after administration to infarcted mouse hearts. TT-10-delivered NP treatment was also associated with significantly smaller infarcts at week 4, with increases in cardiomyocyte proliferation and nuclear Yap abundance and with declines in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Thus, NP-mediated delivery appears to enhance both the potency and durability of TT-10 treatment for myocardial repair.",

                "The endogenous regenerative capacity of adult mammalian hearts is exceptionally limited (1) and cannot replace the cardiomyocytes that are lost to myocardial infarction (MI) or other cardiac disorders. However, when apical resection surgery was performed in mice or pigs shortly after birth, and MI was experimentally induced several weeks later, the animals recovered completely, with little evidence of scarring (1, 2). Furthermore, recovery appeared to be driven primarily by the proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes, suggesting that postnatal cardiomyocytes retain some latent capacity for proliferation and that strategies targeting mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation could lead to the development of promising new therapies for heart disease.",
                "Hippo signaling has a key regulatory role in fetal cardiac development (3, 4), and 2 downstream components of the Hippo pathway, YES-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), have recently been linked to cardiac regeneration (5, 6). The pharmaceutical product TT-10 (C11H10FN3OS2) is a fluorine substituent of TAZ-12, and it appears to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation: in mice, intraperitoneal injections of TT-10 reduced infarct size 1 week after MI but did not prevent progressive declines in cardiac function at later time points (7). Previously, we have shown that when growth factors or small-molecule inhibitors are loaded into poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs; ref. 8), the chemicals are slowly released from the NPs over a period of up to 4 weeks (9, 10). Thus, we investigated whether encapsulating TT-10 into PLGA NPs before administration could extend the duration of TT-10 delivery and improve the potency of TT-10 for treatment of MI."

                        "The effect of TT-10 (Figure 1A) on cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity and proliferation was determined by culturing human induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in varying concentrations of TT-10 (0, 2 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 20 \u03bcM or 100 \u03bcM) for 48 hours and then evaluating the presence of markers for cell proliferation (Ki67 expression, Figure 1B), S phase (BrdU incorporation, Figure 1C), and M phase (histone 3 phosphorylation [PH3], Figure 1D) of the cell cycle and for cytokinesis (Aurora B, Figure 1E). When visualized via immunofluorescence, the proportion of cells displaying each of the 4 markers increased as the TT-10 concentration was raised from 0 to 2 \u03bcM, peaked at 10 to 20 \u03bcM TT-10, and then declined at 100 \u03bcM TT-10. TT-10 treatment (10 \u03bcM) also significantly reduced measures of hiPSC-CM apoptosis (TUNEL staining, Figure 2A) and significantly increased the proportion of hiPSC-CMs with Yap-positive nuclei (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the role of Hippo/Yap signaling in cardiac regeneration (4, 5). The effect of TT-10 on YAP pathway activity was also evaluated via Western blot (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.151987DS1): total Yap levels in hiPSC-CMs treated with or without TT-10 were similar, but phosphorylated Yap (p-Yap) was less abundant in TT-10\u2013treated cells. Thus, because p-Yap is sequestered and degraded in the cytosol, while unphosphorylated Yap translocates to the nucleus where it induces the expression of genes that regulate cell proliferation and survival, these results suggest that the effect of TT-10 treatment on cell cycle progression and apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes was likely mediated, at least in part, by increases in Yap signaling."

                        "MI was induced via permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, and then the animals were randomly assigned to treatment with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (DPBS), empty PLGA NPs (Empty-NPs), TT-10 solution (TT-10\u2013SOL), or TT-10\u2013loaded PLGA NPs (TT-10\u2013NPs). A fifth group of animals (the sham group) underwent all surgical procedures for MI induction except arterial ligation. Before TT-10 administration, the mean diameters of the Empty- and TT-10\u2013NPs were 123.3 \u00b1 1.7 nm and 155.4 \u00b1 0.7 nm, respectively (Figures 3, A and B). Loading efficiency was found to be 2.50 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcg of TT-10 per mg PLGA NPs. And when the TT-10\u2013NPs (1 mg) were incubated in DPBS (1 mL), 47% of the encapsulated TT-10 was released during the first day and 90% was released by day 9 (Figure 3C). TT-10\u2013NPs also significantly increased the expression of proliferation markers in cultured hiPSC-CMs (Supplemental Figure 2), and when hiPSC-CMs were cultured with PLGA-NPs that had been loaded with a fluorescent dye (coumarin-6), immunofluorescence images confirmed that the NPs were taken up by the cells (Figure 3D).",
                        "Four mice died from MI induction. In the surviving animals, echocardiographic (Figure 4A) assessments of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF; Figure 4B), LV fractional shortening (LVFS; Figure 4C), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD; Figure 4D), and LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD; Figure 4E) did not differ significantly among the DPBS, Empty-NP, and TT-10\u2013SOL treatment groups at week 1 or week 4 after treatment; however, ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly greater in TT-10\u2013NP animals at both time points, while end-systolic diameter and end-diastolic diameter were significantly lower at week 4, than in any other group that underwent MI induction. Measurements in animals treated with DPBS, Empty-NPs, or TT-10\u2013SOL also appeared to worsen from week 1 to week 4, while measurements in the TT-10\u2013NP group tended to remain stable (or improve slightly) over the same period. Furthermore, analyses of hearts explanted at week 4 indicated that neither the size of the infarct (Figure 4, F and G) nor the heart weight/bodyweight ratio (Figure 4H) differed significantly among the DPBS, Empty-NP, and TT-10\u2013SOL treatment groups, but both measurements were significantly lower after treatment with TT-10\u2013NP than in any of the other experimental treatment groups. Notably, when NPs were loaded with both TT-10 and coumarin-6 before administration to infarcted mouse hearts, immunofluorescence images of tissues from the border zone (BZ) indicated that most (~70%) of the NPs were degraded by week 1 and a small proportion (<1%) remained detectable through week 4 (Supplemental Figure 3)."

                        "To determine whether the improvements in myocardial recovery observed in TT-10\u2013NP mice were at least partially attributable to the activation of Hippo/Yap signaling and cardiomyocyte proliferation, subsets of mice were sacrificed 1 week after MI induction, and then cardiomyocytes expressing Ki67 (Figure 5A), PH3 (Figure 5B), and nuclear Yap (Figure 5C) were quantified via immunofluorescence in BZ heart sections. All 3 markers were dramatically more common in BZ cardiomyocytes from TT-10\u2013NP animals than in BZ cardiomyocytes from any other group; however, Ki67 and PH3 fluorescence were nearly undetectable in BZ sections from TT-10\u2013NP mice sacrificed 4 weeks after injury and treatment, likely because cardiomyocytes that began actively cycling in response to TT-10\u2013NP administration exited the cell cycle as the NPs degraded and TT-10 abundance declined. Furthermore, although apoptotic cardiomyocytes were significantly more common in BZ sections obtained from all groups at 72 hours after MI induction than in the corresponding region of hearts from sham animals, measurements were significantly lower in TT-10\u2013NP animals than in the DPBS, Empty-NP, or TT-10\u2013SOL treatment groups (Figure 5D). TT-10\u2013NP administration also appeared to promote angiogenesis, because vascular structures that stained positively with the endothelial marker isolectin B4 or for the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin were significantly more numerous 4 weeks after MI, and treatment in BZ sections obtained from TT-10\u2013NP mice had the greatest number of positive vascular structures compared with those from animals in any other group that underwent MI induction (Figure 6). Thus, TT-10\u2013NP administration appeared to improve recovery from MI by promoting angiogenesis as well as cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival."

                "The primary mechanism of cardiomyocyte renewal both for maintaining cardiac homeostasis and during recovery from myocardial injury appears to be the proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes (11, 12). However, mammalian cardiomyocytes undergo cell cycle arrest during the perinatal period, and the residual proliferative capacity of adult cardiomyocytes is far too low to regenerate more than a small fraction of the cardiomyocytes that are lost to MI. Thus, therapies targeting the mechanisms that regulate cell cycle activity may be among the most useful strategies for replacing the myocardial scar with functional contractile tissue, and because this approach mimics the endogenous mechanism of cardiomyocyte renewal, the newly generated cells are likely to be better integrated with the native tissue than exogenously administered cells or engineered tissues.",
                "The Hippo signaling pathway impedes proliferation by sequestering YAP and TAZ in the cytosol. Once activated, YAP and TAZ translocate to the nucleus, where they interact primarily with transcription factors of the TEA domain (TEAD) family and the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex induces the expression of genes that control cell proliferation and apoptosis (13). TT-10 is a fluorine substituent of TAZ-12; results from large-scale, cell-based screenings of pharmacological small molecules indicated that TT-10 promoted both cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation (7). Furthermore, when intraperitoneal injections of TT-10 were administered to mice after experimentally induced MI, the treatment promoted cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity and was associated with declines in infarct size. Measures of cardiac function were also significantly better in TT-10\u2013treated animals than in animals administered the delivery vehicle but declined over time in both groups (7).",
                "Here, we focused on the use of PLGA-NPs for TT-10 administration, which is more efficient than conventional systemic delivery and, consequently, could enable patients to be treated with lower drug doses, thereby reducing the risk of treatment-related adverse events as well as the demand for large-scale TT-10 manufacturing protocols. The beneficial effects associated with free (unencapsulated) TT-10 administration in Hara et al. (7) were achieved with a dose of approximately 250 \u03bcg/mouse (i.e., 10 mg/kg \u00d7 ~25 g/mouse), which is more than 3700-fold greater than the dose administered to animals in our TT-10\u2013SOL and TT-10\u2013NP treatment groups (67.2 ng). Although it is difficult to compare the local accumulated concentration of TT-10 in myocardium between our TT-10\u2013NPs and Hara\u2019s study, it is expected that an enhanced and a long-lasting effect can be achieved by the TT-10\u2013NP delivery approach based on the prolonged release curve (Figure 3C). This low dose and slow and longer release feature likely contribute to the dramatic increase in efficiency associated with NP-mediated drug administration.",
                "Our results indicated that targeted PLGA-NP\u2013mediated TT-10 delivery improved both the potency and durability of the benefits associated with TT-10 administration: infarct sizes were significantly smaller (by ~20%), and cardiac performance was significantly better, in animals treated with TT-10\u2013NPs than those in the TT-10\u2013SOL, Empty-NP, or DPBS treatment groups. While functional parameters remained stable from weeks 1 to 4 in TT-10\u2013NP animals, measurements in the other 3 groups that underwent MI induction worsened over the same period. TT-10\u2013NP administration was also associated with increases in the frequency of Ki67, PH3, and nuclear Yap expression among cardiomyocytes 1 week after treatment, as well as with declines in cardiomyocyte apoptosis on day 3, which was consistent with observations in cultured hiPSC-CMs and suggests that the benefits of treatment evolved, at least in part, via the Yap/TAZ-induced activation of cell cycle progression and cardioprotective mechanisms. However, proliferating cardiomyocytes were nearly undetectable 4 weeks after TT-10\u2013NP delivery, which may be beneficial, because proliferating cardiomyocytes are typically immature and, consequently, could increase the risk of arrhythmia and disrupt contractile activity. TT-10\u2013NP administration also promoted angiogenesis in the peri-infarct region, which (to our knowledge) has not been previously reported, and Yap/TAZ signaling can be activated by hypoxia in some cancers (14, 15), as well as extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., periostin; ref. 16), growth factors (17, 18), and microRNAs (19, 20), all of which have been linked to cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity during development or under disease conditions. Thus, cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in mammalian hearts appears to be governed by a broad range of physiological conditions and signaling mechanisms. The cytoprotective effects of TT-10\u2013NP administration likely occurred during the first few days after administration, when cardiomyocyte apoptosis peaks (21), and may have been mediated by declines in the abundance of ROS and ROS-induced DNA damage (7, 21, 22).",
                "Studies of fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals, such as TT-10, are becoming increasingly common, because these pharmaceuticals are metabolically stable (23) and, consequently, have high bioavailability in vivo. However, their efficacy for treatment of cardiovascular disorders is hampered by poor retention at the site of administration. Thus, our results suggest that PLGA NPs could be used to improve the efficiency of treatment administration for numerous cardiovascular drugs (9). Furthermore, although the animals in our current investigation were treated with TT-10\u2013NPs via direct intramyocardial injections during open-chest surgery, PLGA NPs are fully compatible with less invasive clinical delivery methods, such as catheter-based or echo-guided transthoracic myocardial injection.",
                "In summary, the results from our investigation in a mouse MI model demonstrate that measures of cardiac function and infarct size are significantly better when the animals receive intramyocardial injections of TT-10\u2013loaded NPs rather than TT-10\u2013SOL. Thus, PLGA-NP\u2013mediated delivery appears to enhance the potency of TT-10, which may also reduce the occurrence of treatment-related side effects and other safety concerns by enabling the drug to be administered at lower doses. Collectively, these observations support the continued development of TT-10\u2013NPs for the treatment of cardiac disease and provide proof of concept for the PLGA-NP\u2013mediated delivery of other therapeutic agents."
