                        "The various embodiments provide an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that supports two distinct types of gapless unidirectional channels, one from antiferromagnetic domain walls and the other from single-height steps. Their distinct geometric nature allows them to intersect robustly to form quantum point junctions, and their presence at the surface makes them subject to control by magnetic and electrostatic local probes. Given the existence of stable and tunable junctions, the intrinsic magnetism and the potential for higher-temperature performance make this material system a promising platform for electron quantum optics and microelectronic applications. The stable and tunable junctions allow for the full control of the mixing and interference of edge-state wave functions.",

Instead, gapped surfaces may appear naturally on this material, and these gapped surfaces exhibit a half-quantized surface anomalous Hall conductivity (i.e., an odd integer times e2/2h) whose sign is determined by details of the magnetic order at the terminating surface. Manipulation of the surface termination and/or magnetic order in one region of the surface relative to a neighboring patch, or on one facet relative to another that meets it at a \u201chinge,\u201d may give rise to a chiral edge channel at the boundary between these patches or facets. Chiral edge states provide directional control of carrier propagation and (topological) protection against impurity backscattering.",
                        "Various embodiments contemplate the creation and manipulation of chiral edge channels on the surface of an antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AFM TI), a class of materials including MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, EuIn2As2 and NpBi which may be described as intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, axion insulators and second-order topological insulators. These materials may provide both bulk and surface gaps on the order of hundreds of meV, allowing for potential room temperature device operation. Various embodiments also contemplate a novel quantum point junction (QPJ) at the surface of an AFM TI.",
                        "FIGS. 1(a)-1(d) depict a bulk domain wall structure and a surface step structure formed on a surface of an A-type AFM TI. Specifically, FIG. 1 depicts a chiral channel (cylinder 110) at the surface of an A-type AFM TI due to (a) a bulk domain wall; and (b) a surface step. FIG. 1(c) depicts surface band structures along (001) for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (8) in the presence of (c), a bulk domain wall; and (d) a surface step. The projection of the states on the chiral channels (cylinder 110) in (a) and (b) are also shown in FIGS. 1(c) and 1(d) as the dotted lines to illustrate the localization of the massless Dirac fermions that disperse linearly along the channel direction at low energy with velocities \u03bddw in FIG. 1(c) and vst. in FIG. 1(d).",
                        "Specifically, FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b) show a prototypical spin arrangement in an AFM TI. The magnetic ordering is A-type AFM, i.e., with magnetization uniform in-plane but alternating from plane to plane along the stacking direction, which is taken to be along {circumflex over (z)}. Each individual layer can be thought of as adiabatically connected to a 2D Chern insulator, with the sign of the Chern number alternating from layer to layer. The sign of the surface anomalous Hall conductivity of \u00b1e2/2h is thus determined by the magnetic orientation of the last layer at the surface. As a result, two kinds of 1D chiral channels can occur at the surface. As shown in FIG. 1(a), the emergence of a bulk AFM domain wall at the surface reverses the sign of the anomalous Hall conductivity on either side of the resulting line defect, which therefore carries a topologically protected chiral channel denoted herein as a domain-wall channel. Alternatively, even if no bulk AFM domain walls are present, a single-height step can occur on the surface, as shown in FIG. 1(b). If it does, it also marks a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall conductivity when crossing the step, and thus carries a chiral edge channel as well. This is denoted herein as a step channel.",
                        "FIG. 1(c) and (d) show the manifestation of the domain-wall and step channel in the surface band structure as described in the context of a tight-binding model as discussed/used throughout this Specification. The presence of either of these defects results in 1D linear dispersions in the otherwise gapped bulk and surface spectrum of the AFM TI. The states that comprise the chiral bands are exponentially localized in the vicinity of the channel, and host 1D massless Dirac fermions.",
                        "FIGS. 2(a)-2(b) depict a bulk domain wall structure and a surface step structure formed in an intersecting manner on a surface of an A-type AFM TI. Specifically, a novel opportunity opened by the presence of two different kinds of 1D chiral channels at the surface, is that these can be made to intersect, as shown in FIG. 2(a), and such intersections are expected to remain thermodynamically stable. In contrast, as illustrated in FIG. 2(b), an intersection between two surface steps can easily evolve via a pinch-off event into a configuration in which an isthmus of constant surface height separates the steps; indeed, the width of such an isthmus will tend to grow due to the line tensions of the steps, and the quantum junction will have been removed. A similar mechanism affects the intersection of two domain walls. In fact, setups like those depicted in the inset of FIG. 2(b) where two chiral channels come in close proximity, have long been used in quantum Hall systems to realize electron interferometers. These constructions, known as quantum point contacts (QPCs), enable tunneling between channels."

Moreover, it is shown that a QPJ can be controlled by scanning tips of the kind used in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related methods. Here, the interest is in local probes that affect the magnetic moments and electrostatic potential, which are referred to as magnetic and electrostatic STM tips respectively. The properties of the QPJ by constructing the Hamiltonian associated with the system are depicted in FIG. 2(a), along with performing dynamic wave-packet (WP) simulations that allow the extraction of the S-matrix of the junction. The magnetic and electrostatic STM tips in proximity with the junction may be used to realize any unitary S-matrix.

In fact, the choice of \u03c6a=1 and \u03c6b=0 simplifies the situation, since R{circumflex over (z)}(\u03b1) just corresponds to an overall phase, which is not of interest. Physically, the WP splits equally at the first junction (\u03b2=\u03c0/2), and the electrostatic STM tip, corresponding to the second term in Eq.

To see the effects of the phase manipulation, consider the interference that conveniently occurs when the WPs meet again (due to periodic boundary conditions in x and y) at Junction 2. In FIG. 4(d), the electrostatic tip is centered four unit cells to the right at (x0, y0)=(4, 0), which approximately makes \u03b3=\u03c0/2 so that S1=R{circumflex over (z)}(\u03c0/2) R\u0177(\u03b1(\u03c0/2), while S2=R\u0177(\u03b1(\u03c0/2) as before. After scattering at Junction 1 the outgoing WP, whose state corresponds to a vector pointing along the +y direction of the Bloch sphere, becomes the incoming WP at Junction 2. Since Junction 2 acts as a rotation around the y-axis, it does not affect the qubit state of the WP. Similarly, in FIG. 4(e), set (x0, y0) =(8, 0), so that after encountering Junction 1 the qubit state points along \u2212{circumflex over (x)}, and after Junction 2 it returns to its initial +{circumflex over (z)} state.

For example, the inventors have seen that it naturally implements the Hadamard gate so that the WP splits equally after encountering the QPJ; this behavior is enforced by the mirror symmetries Mx and My of the bulk Hamiltonian, and should not be expected in general. Breaking these symmetries does not affect the ability of the protocol to control the S matrix.",

A significant advantage of the QPJ design presented here is that the chiral channels on the domain walls and steps cannot backscatter and are therefore expected to be robust against the presence of weak disorder (i.e., such that the average bulk and surface gaps remains open). A demonstrate this topological protection of the QPJ may be made by introducing disorder into the model via a short-ranged random potential that is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Although the qubit gets dephased in a different way for each realization of disorder, the electrostatic tip can be used to recalibrate the QPJ. That is to remove the random offsets arising from the specific impurity configuration, thus enabling the control of the junction even in the presence of weak disorder."

                                "Disclosed herein is a versatile new platform for performing electron quantum optics. It is not hard to see how existing constructions, such as the Mach-Zehnder electron interferometer can be implemented directly on the surface of an AFM TI FIG. 5(a) shows a domain-wall loop channel intersecting a step channel. In this case, the interferometer works by splitting the incoming current (that flows on the step channel) in two parts that encircle the area defined by the domain-wall loop and meet at the second QPJ where they interfere. An Aharonov-Bohm phase can be introduced by threading the loop with a magnetic flux. In this way, varying the external magnetic field results in oscillations of the output conductance. The ability to control the S matrix of the QPJs means they can be calibrated so that the interferometer can be used as a sensitive sensor.",
                                "In the quantum-Hall regime of 2D electron gases, the long edge-state coherence length and the on-demand creation of indistinguishable, single-electron WPs have inspired ambitious proposals that consider electron interferometers as platforms for quantum information processing. In this approach, electronic flying qubits\u2014another prominent scheme is based on photonic flying qubits\u2014are subjected to quantum operations while they are being coherently transferred, providing control over qubit separation and non-local entanglement. In contrast to photons, electrons are subject to Coulomb interactions, making them vulnerable to dephasing but, at the same time, allowing control of the entanglement strength and manipulation of the phase.",
                                "In the context of quantum Hall systems, entangling devices have been constructed by Coulomb-coupling two Mach-Zehnder interferometers to induce a relative phase \u03c6 between the WPs of the two coupled channels. These devices can be used as electronic quantum erasers or even as entangling quantum gates, i.e., controlled phase gates. It is shown herein that QPJs can implement any single-qubit gate, a gate such as that FIG. 5(b) can be adopted to perform the two-qubit entanglement for a universal set of quantum gates. It is noted that chiral Majorana fermions, first seen in magnetic TI-superconductor structures and more recently in topological superconductors, are the superconducting analog of the chiral fermions discussed here. It has been proposed that topological quantum computing can be achieved using WPs propagating on chiral Majorana channels. An interesting question is whether analogs of robust QPJs can be constructed in the superconducting case.",
                                "Finally, a comment on issues of temperature of operation and decoherence. In one sense, the disclosed embodiments are robust to higher temperatures than quantum Hall systems; only requiring that the operating temperature to be small compared to the Neel temperature and the band gap in which the chiral mode is propagating. Thus, operation at tens of Kelvins is plausible for some future materials realization. Any application that is sensitive to decoherence will require operation at lower temperatures, perhaps comparable to those needed for the quantum Hall platform, to avoid dephasing due to electron-electron, electron-phonon and electron-magnon interactions. Nonetheless, the absence of backscattering strongly suppresses these dephasing processes relative to a normal quasi-one-dimensional wire and it is expected this will lead to a long edge state coherence length. In the quantum Hall context for example, edge state decoherence has been studied using Mach-Zehnder interferometry, demonstrating coherence lengths up to 100 \u03bcm. Since each quantum operation is performed within L\u22481 \u03bcm, it should be possible to perform many qubit operations before decoherence sets in. An implementation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer on the surface of an AFM TI would open the path to the study of coherent transport in this exciting new family of materials.",

By identifying the two incoming channels with the two \u201ccode\u201d states of a qubit, the results show that the S matrix of the quantum point junction acts as a single-qubit gate rotating the state vector of the qubit to produce the two outgoing channels. Furthermore, it is shown that magnetic and electrostatic tips from scanning tunneling microscopy can modify the junction so that its S matrix can perform any rotation on the Bloch sphere, realizing a universal one-qubit gate. In addition, the considered effects of symmetries and disorder and have illustrated that these affects can be \u201cgauged\u201d away through calibrating the junction.

In the last term in Eq. (8), mz is the strength of the staggered Zeeman field corresponding to A-type (layered) AFM order, doubling the unit cell and converting the model to represent an AFM topological insulator. Time reversal itself is now broken, but time reversal followed by a unit translation along {circumflex over (z)} is a good symmetry. For the choice of parameters, the model is in the topological phase, with a formal magnetoelectric coupling of (\u03b8/2\u03c0)(e2/h) with axion coupling \u03b8=\u03c0. As a result, {circumflex over (z)}-normal surfaces are naturally gapped and carry an anomalous Hall conductivity of \u00b1e2/2h.",
                                "Method B: Wave-packet construction. Construct the initial WPs in the space of momentum k\u2225 along the direction of propagation. Calculate the surface band structure for a supercell Hamiltonian Hdw or Hst containing a domain wall or step, whose presence results in mid-gap bands localized on the conducting channels in the otherwise gapped surface, as shown in FIG. 1(c) and (d), respectively. Note that technically each slab contains two domain walls and two steps. In the domain wall case, the configuration as a whole is invariant under time reversal times inversion, so the bands shown are Kramers degenerate.",
                                "Next, construct the WP by making a quantum superposition of channel-localized solutions according to a k\u2225-space envelope function that is taken to be a Gaussian. This results in a WP that is localized in all three real space dimensions. This is then used as the initial wave function \u03a8(0) of the time-evolution problem for the much larger system that includes the QPJ and is described by the Hamiltonian HQPJ. Having defined HQPJ as the model Hamiltonian H0 in the presence of an antiferromagnetic domain wall and a single-height step that intersect in the center of the surface.",
                                "Method C: Wave-packet dynamics. To avoid finite-size effects, the system size L should be much larger than the extent of the WPs along the channel. When both a domain wall and step are present, momentum is no longer a good quantum number in any direction, so compute the time evolution entirely in real space. This is done using Chebyshev series expansion methods applied to the time-evolution operator e\u2212iHt. Using slabs of size 160\u00d7160 in-plane and 16 cells thick, enough to minimize finite-size effects, and adopt a Chebyshev expansion order of NC=211 so that the method may time evolve the state accurately over the needed time intervals.",

(9), choose the region \u03a9Z such that it restricts the sum to surface orbitals that lie within a radius r of the tip, and that already experience a negative Zeeman field from the bulk Hamiltonian of Eq. (8). Thus, VZ=mz is just enough to remove the Zeeman field from these sites, and VZ=2mz makes the surface-layer Zeeman field equal on both sides of the domain wall or step, as in FIG. 4(a). Then tune between these extremes by taking VZ\u2208[0, 2mz], thus modeling cases in which the magnetic tip has only partially reversed the surface field. Similarly, for VZ<0, \u03a9Z is chosen such that the second term in Eq. (9) is restricted to surface orbitals experiencing a positive Zeeman field in the bulk Hamiltonian.",

(9), is defined to be a rectangle centered at (x0, y0) relative to the QPJ and one unit cell deep, as shown by the grey shading in FIG. 4(d). A WP propagating for a distance  along any domain-wall or step channel lying inside the quantum well defined by \u03a9G acquires an additional phase proportional to \u0394k, where \u0394k is the shift of the Fermi wavevector of the channel. In the approximation of linear dispersion, \u0394k=VG/\u03bdF, where VG corresponds to a local gate voltage and \u03bdF is the Fermi velocity (equal to \u03bddw and \u03bdst for domain-wall and step channels respectively).
