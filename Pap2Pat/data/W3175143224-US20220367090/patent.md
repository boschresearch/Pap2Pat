## FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure generally relates to the generation and manipulation of the quantum point junctions on the surface of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.

## BACKGROUND

This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art, which may be related to various aspects of the present invention that are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.

Surface and edge-state engineering of topological materials offers great promise for future electronic devices. Owing to the topological properties of the bulk of the material, surface states emerge that are protected from elastic and inelastic scattering. In particular topologically-protected chiral (one-way) or helical (2-way) edge states provide dissipation-less “quantum wires” with potential applications in sensor, low-power computing, and quantum information technologies. A crucial part of engineering such wires requires robust and tunable junctions between edge states.

The inventors note that surface and edge-state engineering of topological materials offers great promise for future electronic devices. Owing to the topological properties of the bulk of the material, surface states emerge that are protected from elastic and inelastic scattering. In particular topologically-protected chiral (one-way) or helical (2-way) edge states provide dissipation-less “quantum wires” with potential applications in sensor, low-power computing, and quantum information technologies. A crucial part of engineering such wires requires robust and tunable junctions between edge states.

The various embodiments provide an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that supports two distinct types of gapless unidirectional channels, one from antiferromagnetic domain walls and the other from single-height steps. Their distinct geometric nature allows them to intersect robustly to form quantum point junctions, and their presence at the surface makes them subject to control by magnetic and electrostatic local probes. Given the existence of stable and tunable junctions, the intrinsic magnetism and the potential for higher-temperature performance make this material system a promising platform for electron quantum optics and microelectronic applications. The stable and tunable junctions allow for the full control of the mixing and interference of edge-state wave functions.

Various embodiments provide a material whose magnetic symmetry group enforces a quantized bulk axion coupling of θ=π, as in an ordinary 3D TI, but does not enforce the presence of gapless surface states. Instead, gapped surfaces may appear naturally on this material, and these gapped surfaces exhibit a half-quantized surface anomalous Hall conductivity (i.e., an odd integer times e2/2h) whose sign is determined by details of the magnetic order at the terminating surface. Manipulation of the surface termination and/or magnetic order in one region of the surface relative to a neighboring patch, or on one facet relative to another that meets it at a “hinge,” may give rise to a chiral edge channel at the boundary between these patches or facets. Chiral edge states provide directional control of carrier propagation and (topological) protection against impurity backscattering.

Various embodiments contemplate the creation and manipulation of chiral edge channels on the surface of an antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AFM TI), a class of materials including MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, EuIn2As2 and NpBi which may be described as intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, axion insulators and second-order topological insulators. These materials may provide both bulk and surface gaps on the order of hundreds of meV, allowing for potential room temperature device operation. Various embodiments also contemplate a novel quantum point junction (QPJ) at the surface of an AFM TI.

FIGS. 1(a)-1(d) depict a bulk domain wall structure and a surface step structure formed on a surface of an A-type AFM TI. Specifically, FIG. 1 depicts a chiral channel (cylinder 110) at the surface of an A-type AFM TI due to (a) a bulk domain wall; and (b) a surface step. FIG. 1(c) depicts surface band structures along (001) for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (8) in the presence of (c), a bulk domain wall; and (d) a surface step. The projection of the states on the chiral channels (cylinder 110) in (a) and (b) are also shown in FIGS. 1(c) and 1(d) as the dotted lines to illustrate the localization of the massless Dirac fermions that disperse linearly along the channel direction at low energy with velocities νdw in FIG. 1(c) and vst. in FIG. 1(d).

Specifically, FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b) show a prototypical spin arrangement in an AFM TI. The magnetic ordering is A-type AFM, i.e., with magnetization uniform in-plane but alternating from plane to plane along the stacking direction, which is taken to be along {circumflex over (z)}. Each individual layer can be thought of as adiabatically connected to a 2D Chern insulator, with the sign of the Chern number alternating from layer to layer. The sign of the surface anomalous Hall conductivity of ±e2/2h is thus determined by the magnetic orientation of the last layer at the surface. As a result, two kinds of 1D chiral channels can occur at the surface. As shown in FIG. 1(a), the emergence of a bulk AFM domain wall at the surface reverses the sign of the anomalous Hall conductivity on either side of the resulting line defect, which therefore carries a topologically protected chiral channel denoted herein as a domain-wall channel. Alternatively, even if no bulk AFM domain walls are present, a single-height step can occur on the surface, as shown in FIG. 1(b). If it does, it also marks a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall conductivity when crossing the step, and thus carries a chiral edge channel as well. This is denoted herein as a step channel.

FIG. 1(c) and (d) show the manifestation of the domain-wall and step channel in the surface band structure as described in the context of a tight-binding model as discussed/used throughout this Specification. The presence of either of these defects results in 1D linear dispersions in the otherwise gapped bulk and surface spectrum of the AFM TI. The states that comprise the chiral bands are exponentially localized in the vicinity of the channel, and host 1D massless Dirac fermions.

FIGS. 2(a)-2(b) depict a bulk domain wall structure and a surface step structure formed in an intersecting manner on a surface of an A-type AFM TI. Specifically, a novel opportunity opened by the presence of two different kinds of 1D chiral channels at the surface, is that these can be made to intersect, as shown in FIG. 2(a), and such intersections are expected to remain thermodynamically stable. In contrast, as illustrated in FIG. 2(b), an intersection between two surface steps can easily evolve via a pinch-off event into a configuration in which an isthmus of constant surface height separates the steps; indeed, the width of such an isthmus will tend to grow due to the line tensions of the steps, and the quantum junction will have been removed. A similar mechanism affects the intersection of two domain walls. In fact, setups like those depicted in the inset of FIG. 2(b) where two chiral channels come in close proximity, have long been used in quantum Hall systems to realize electron interferometers. These constructions, known as quantum point contacts (QPCs), enable tunneling between channels.

### Construction of Intersecting Chiral Channels

Intersecting chiral channels may be constructed using a novel material system that is on the verge of discovery. In fact, these junctions were recently observed to appear naturally at the surface of the putative AFM TI MnBi2Te4. Moreover, it is shown that a QPJ can be controlled by scanning tips of the kind used in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related methods. Here, the interest is in local probes that affect the magnetic moments and electrostatic potential, which are referred to as magnetic and electrostatic STM tips respectively. The properties of the QPJ by constructing the Hamiltonian associated with the system are depicted in FIG. 2(a), along with performing dynamic wave-packet (WP) simulations that allow the extraction of the S-matrix of the junction. The magnetic and electrostatic STM tips in proximity with the junction may be used to realize any unitary S-matrix. In addition, it is noted that the effect of symmetry breaking terms and weak disorder can be “gauged away” using the two tips.

The stability and tunability of the proposed junction, together with the intrinsic benefits of a magnetic topological material, can be of great utility in established and new applications involving unidirectional channels, such as electron interferometry, low-power electronics and quantum information processing.

### Extracting the S Matrix

Begin by considering the WP dynamics at the surface of an AFM TI. FIGS. 3(a)-3(f) graphically depict wave packet dynamics at the surface of the A-type AFM TI of FIG. 2. FIG. 3(a) shows the calculated time evolution of a WP on a single domain-wall channel, while FIG. 3(b) shows that of a WP in the presence of the QPJ in FIG. 2(a) In both cases the dissipationless channels are protected from back-scattering by the insulating bulk and surface gaps. The wave function of the WP is thus exponentially confined to the vicinity of the one-dimensional channel, and it travels with a constant group velocity along the channel. In FIG. 3(b), a WP enters along the domain wall channel, gets split by the QPJ, and then the two components travel away from the QPJ along the step channels. Configurations in which multiple consecutive scattering events occur will be considered below.

FIG. 2(a) depicts the intersection of a domain-wall channel with a step channel results in a thermodynamically stable junction, i.e., small surface deformations can only move the junction but not remove it. FIG. 2(b) depicts the intersection of two step channels (or two domain-wall channels) is unstable. The inset shows how small deformations remove the junction. arrows indicate the direction of propagation on the chiral channels, while dark and bright surfaces indicate whether the anomalous Hall conductivity is ±e2/2h respectively.

With respect to the behaviors discussed above, it is noted that the wave function of a WP propagating along a single domain-wall channel in direction y, as in FIG. 3(a), can be well approximated as

Ψστdw(x,y,z,t)=χστdw(x,z)f(y−y0−vdwt)  (1)


- - where χ_(στ)^(dw) (x,z) captures the transverse shape (x,z) and
    spin-orbital character (σ, τ indices respectively) of the WP, while
    f(y) is the envelope function of the WP, which is taken to be a
    Gaussian.

The WP is launched from position y0 at time t=0 and travels with group velocity vdw (which is set by the surface state dispersion in FIG. 1(c)). In modeling at this level, neglect spreading of the WP, which is negligible in simulations. Similar considerations apply to the propagation of a WP on a step along x traveling with group velocity vst (that is set by the surface state dispersion in FIG. 1(d)).

Consider the scattering event depicted in FIG. 3(b), where an incoming WP splits after encountering the QPJ. Using unprimed labels a and b to refer to the two incoming domain-wall channels of Junction 1, as in FIG. 3(c). Note that the extra junctions are the result of in-plane periodic boundary conditions. The incoming initial conditions are specified by amplitudes φa=1 and φb=0. Now let ti indicate a time after the scattering through Junction 1 is complete, but before Junction 2 is encountered. Labeling the two outgoing step channels as a′ and b′, and adopting once and for all the arbitrary convention that a→a′ and b→b′ result from taking left turns, as shown in FIG. 3(c). As illustrated in FIG. 3(b), one component of the WP moves to the right and the other to the left, with velocities vst and −vst respectively. At time t1 both will be centered at a distance x1 relative to the junction, and the following may be expected:

Ψστst(x,y,z,t1)=ϕα′{tilde over (χ)}στst(y,z)f(x+x1)+ϕb′χστst(y,z)f(x−x1)  (2)


- - where ϕ_(a′) and ϕ_(b′) are the amplitudes (magnitude and phase)
    describing scattering from incoming channel a into channels a′ and
    b′ respectively, and {tilde over (χ)}^(st) is the time-reversed
    partner of χ^(st). These expectations are well reproduced in full
    numerical calculations which therefore allow extraction of the
    amplitudes ϕ_(a′) and ϕ_(b′).

Similar calculations, where the incident WP approaches Junction 1 along the −ŷ direction on channel b, allow extracting the corresponding amplitudes that result for initial conditions of φa=0 and φb=1. Thus, there can be modeled a combined scattering event via

\(\begin{matrix}
{\begin{pmatrix}
\phi_{a}^{\prime} \\
\phi_{b}^{\prime}
\end{pmatrix} = {S\begin{pmatrix}
\phi_{a} \\
\phi_{b}
\end{pmatrix}}} & (3)
\end{matrix}\)


- - where the elements of the S-matrix are determined by the four
    complex amplitudes discussed above.

In this way, the evolution of the system of propagating WPs is mapped onto that of a two-level quantum system, so that it is enough to restrict S to be an SU(2) matrix. The characterization of a junction by such an S-matrix is a central element of the theory. It is illustrative to represent the initial or final state as a point on the Bloch sphere,

\(\begin{matrix}
{\begin{pmatrix}
\phi_{a} \\
\phi_{b}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
{\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
{e^{i\phi}{\sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}
\end{pmatrix}} & (4)
\end{matrix}\)


- - where θ determines the relative WP magnitude on channels a and b and
    φ their phase difference, as illustrated in FIG. 3(*d*).

Each junction scattering event can then be described by the action of the corresponding junction S-matrix on the spinor representation of the channel states, regarded as a qubit state, and the result of consecutive QPJ scattering events, as in FIG. 3(e), corresponds to the action of consecutive gates acting on these qubits as illustrated in FIG. 3(f).

FIG. 3(a) depicts snapshots of the WP showing the propagation on the domain-wall channel. FIG. 3(b) depicts a WP scattering at Junction 1 and splitting into two spatially separated outgoing components of the wavefunction. FIG. 3(c) depicts a channel labeling convention for Junction 1 and 2. FIG. 3(d) depicts qubit representation of a WP state on the Bloch sphere. FIG. 3(e) depicts initial WP splits after encountering Junction 1, where the two components then meet at Junction 2, interfering destructively on channel a′ and constructively on channel b′. FIG. 3(f) depicts Qubit representation of the time evolution in FIG. 3(e). WP plots in FIG. 3(a), FIG. 3(b), FIG. 3(e), are calculated from the (001)-projected probability densities at different times.

Returning to a more specific discussion of the full time-evolution calculations, and the analysis of them in terms of the framework sketched above. FIG. 3(e) shows the time evolution of a WP initiated on channel a. The WP propagates towards and then scatters at Junction 1, splitting into two equal parts. Later the two WPs pass through Junction 2, interfering destructively and constructively on outgoing channels a′ and b′ respectively. The time evolution of the WP configuration can be described as a qubit passing through two gates. Using the convention of FIG. 3(c), the calculated S matrix of Junction 1 and 2 corresponds to the Hadamard gate

\(\begin{matrix}
{S_{1} = {S_{2} = {\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & {- 1} \\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}}}} & (5)
\end{matrix}\)


- - so that the final state is related to the initial one by applying
    the Hadamard gate twice. Geometrically the S matrix is expressed as:

\(\begin{matrix}
{S = {{R_{\hat{n}}(\varphi)} = {e^{- i}\frac{\varphi}{2}{\hat{n} \cdot \sigma}}}} & (6)
\end{matrix}\)

describes a qubit rotation by an angle ϕ through an axis {circumflex over (n)} and σ32 (σx, σy, σz) is a vector of Pauli matrices. Since S1=S2=Rŷ (π/2), each application rotates the qubit by 90° around the ŷ axis of the Bloch sphere, resulting in an overall reversal of the pseudospin as shown in FIG. 3(f).

Controlling The S Matrix 100391 Before explaining how the control of the S matrix is achieved, it is illustrative to break down the action of S into three stages. First the propagation along the incoming channels; since these cannot scatter into one another, this is represented by a diagonal matrix Sdw. Then there is the scattering Spj at the QPJ itself, followed by another channel-diagonal propagation Sst on the outgoing step channels. The overall S matrix can then be written in terms of the Pauli matrices as:

S=SstSpjSdw=e−γσ2e−iβσ/2e−ασ/2  ,(7)


- - where S_(pj) is expressed as a real orthogonal matrix because the
    phases can be absorbed into S_(dw) and S_(st).

Remarkably, (α, β, γ) are exactly the three Euler angles that can be used to express any SU(2) matrix. Thus control over the three Euler angles results in a universally programmable gate.

To control the S matrix, various embodiments use two local probes in the vicinity of the junction. The first one, which is referred to as a magnetic STM tip, affects the local magnetic moments, and as shall be seen, controls the magnitudes of the S matrix. The second probe is an electrostatic STM tip modifying the site energies under the tip, thus controlling the phases of the S matrix. The effect of the magnetic tip is controlled through the coefficient VZ, and that of the electrostatic tip through VG, both acting in the local vicinity of the junction. For more details on how this is modeled, see Eq. (9).

a. Magnitude control. Set VG=0, leaving the electric potential constant throughout the crystal so that no extra phase evolution occurs during the propagation (α=γ=0), and vary the strength of the magnetic tip VZ. This affects the left-right magnitude splitting, i.e., S=Rŷ(β)=e−iβσ/2 in Eq. (7), with β=β(VZ). To understand the mechanism behind the magnitude control, first consider the extreme scenario depicted in FIG. 4(a).

FIGS. 4(a)-4(f) graphically depict wave packet dynamics for a scenario useful in understanding the various embodiments. Specifically, FIGS. 4(a)-4(f) illustrate control of a quantum point junction using a magnetic and electrostatic local probe. FIG. 4(a) depicts the magnetic STM tip with VZ=2mz in Eq. (9) which has polarized the surface spins in a circular region centered at the junction resulting in two uncoupled channels. FIG. 4(b) depicts partially polarized region with VZ=0.4 mz which causes unequal splitting of the WP. FIG. 4(c) depicts numerical calculation of the magnitude splitting cos2β/2 as a function of VZ. Each value corresponds to the integral of |Ψ(t1)|2 on channel a′ of Junction 1. Applying the electrostatic STM tip with VG=0.6 in Eq. (9) at Junction 1 induces a phase difference between the outgoing WPs which then affects how they interfere at Junction 2. FIG. 4(d) depicts that the center of the rectangular region ΩG is chosen so that γ=π/2. FIG. 4(e) depicts that the center of the rectangular region ΩG is chosen so that γ=π, making the WPs constructively (destructively) interfere on channel a(b) of Junction 2. FIG. 4(f) depicts numerical calculation of the angle γ from the relative phase of the outgoing WPs at t1 as a function of x0. The phases of the outgoing WPs are determined from the inner product between Ψ(t1) in the presence and absence of the phase gate.

Here a strong magnetic STM tip has polarized the surface magnetization in the vicinity of the junction (orange circular region), forcing the anomalous Hall conductivity to be uniformly +e2/2h in that area. This essentially “removes” the junction, and the WP is completely transferred from the domain-wall (channel a) to the edge of the step (channel b′), so that S1=Rŷ(π). An example of partial polarization, is shown in FIG. 4(b), while the results of tuning VZ over the entire range of tip strength is shown in FIG. 4(c), where plotting the numerically calculated value of cos2(β/2), which represents the asymmetry between left- and right-scattered WPs, as a function of VZ. This demonstrates the universal control of the Euler angle β using a magnetic STM tip.

b. Phase control. To illustrate the phase control, set VZ=0, fix VG to a non-zero value (see Eq. (9), and control the position of the electrostatic tip. Then Sj=R{circumflex over (z)}(γ) Rŷ(π/2) R{circumflex over (z)}(α), where α and γ are determined by the position (x0, y0) of the tip relative to the junction, as described by Eq. (10). The electrostatic tip is depicted as a shaded square with origin (x0, y0) in FIG. 4(d) and (e). In fact, the choice of φa=1 and φb=0 simplifies the situation, since R{circumflex over (z)}(α) just corresponds to an overall phase, which is not of interest. Physically, the WP splits equally at the first junction (β=π/2), and the electrostatic STM tip, corresponding to the second term in Eq. (9), is then used to control the relative phases of the outgoing WPs via the R{circumflex over (z)}(γ) term.

FIG. 4(d)-(f) illustrate the phase control by applying the electrostatic gate on Junction 1. To see the effects of the phase manipulation, consider the interference that conveniently occurs when the WPs meet again (due to periodic boundary conditions in x and y) at Junction 2. In FIG. 4(d), the electrostatic tip is centered four unit cells to the right at (x0, y0)=(4, 0), which approximately makes γ=π/2 so that S1=R{circumflex over (z)}(π/2) Rŷ(α(π/2), while S2=Rŷ(α(π/2) as before. After scattering at Junction 1 the outgoing WP, whose state corresponds to a vector pointing along the +y direction of the Bloch sphere, becomes the incoming WP at Junction 2. Since Junction 2 acts as a rotation around the y-axis, it does not affect the qubit state of the WP. Similarly, in FIG. 4(e), set (x0, y0) =(8, 0), so that after encountering Junction 1 the qubit state points along −{circumflex over (x)}, and after Junction 2 it returns to its initial +{circumflex over (z)} state. FIG. 4(f) presents a numerical calculation of γ versus x0. This is done by calculating the phase of the WPs just after it scatters off Junction 1. What is found is a linear behavior as expected from Eq. (10).

In summary, using the two STM tips enables control of α, β, and γ independently in Eq. (7), so that the junction can be made to implement any SU(2) gate.

c. Symmetries. The QPJ has many artificial symmetries that in any real application will be absent. For example, the inventors have seen that it naturally implements the Hadamard gate so that the WP splits equally after encountering the QPJ; this behavior is enforced by the mirror symmetries Mx and My of the bulk Hamiltonian, and should not be expected in general. Breaking these symmetries does not affect the ability of the protocol to control the S matrix.

d. Stability to disorder. A significant advantage of the QPJ design presented here is that the chiral channels on the domain walls and steps cannot backscatter and are therefore expected to be robust against the presence of weak disorder (i.e., such that the average bulk and surface gaps remains open). A demonstrate this topological protection of the QPJ may be made by introducing disorder into the model via a short-ranged random potential that is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Although the qubit gets dephased in a different way for each realization of disorder, the electrostatic tip can be used to recalibrate the QPJ. That is to remove the random offsets arising from the specific impurity configuration, thus enabling the control of the junction even in the presence of weak disorder.

### Discussion

Disclosed herein is a versatile new platform for performing electron quantum optics. It is not hard to see how existing constructions, such as the Mach-Zehnder electron interferometer can be implemented directly on the surface of an AFM TI FIG. 5(a) shows a domain-wall loop channel intersecting a step channel. In this case, the interferometer works by splitting the incoming current (that flows on the step channel) in two parts that encircle the area defined by the domain-wall loop and meet at the second QPJ where they interfere. An Aharonov-Bohm phase can be introduced by threading the loop with a magnetic flux. In this way, varying the external magnetic field results in oscillations of the output conductance. The ability to control the S matrix of the QPJs means they can be calibrated so that the interferometer can be used as a sensitive sensor.

In the quantum-Hall regime of 2D electron gases, the long edge-state coherence length and the on-demand creation of indistinguishable, single-electron WPs have inspired ambitious proposals that consider electron interferometers as platforms for quantum information processing. In this approach, electronic flying qubits—another prominent scheme is based on photonic flying qubits—are subjected to quantum operations while they are being coherently transferred, providing control over qubit separation and non-local entanglement. In contrast to photons, electrons are subject to Coulomb interactions, making them vulnerable to dephasing but, at the same time, allowing control of the entanglement strength and manipulation of the phase.

In the context of quantum Hall systems, entangling devices have been constructed by Coulomb-coupling two Mach-Zehnder interferometers to induce a relative phase φ between the WPs of the two coupled channels. These devices can be used as electronic quantum erasers or even as entangling quantum gates, i.e., controlled phase gates. It is shown herein that QPJs can implement any single-qubit gate, a gate such as that FIG. 5(b) can be adopted to perform the two-qubit entanglement for a universal set of quantum gates. It is noted that chiral Majorana fermions, first seen in magnetic TI-superconductor structures and more recently in topological superconductors, are the superconducting analog of the chiral fermions discussed here. It has been proposed that topological quantum computing can be achieved using WPs propagating on chiral Majorana channels. An interesting question is whether analogs of robust QPJs can be constructed in the superconducting case.

Finally, a comment on issues of temperature of operation and decoherence. In one sense, the disclosed embodiments are robust to higher temperatures than quantum Hall systems; only requiring that the operating temperature to be small compared to the Neel temperature and the band gap in which the chiral mode is propagating. Thus, operation at tens of Kelvins is plausible for some future materials realization. Any application that is sensitive to decoherence will require operation at lower temperatures, perhaps comparable to those needed for the quantum Hall platform, to avoid dephasing due to electron-electron, electron-phonon and electron-magnon interactions. Nonetheless, the absence of backscattering strongly suppresses these dephasing processes relative to a normal quasi-one-dimensional wire and it is expected this will lead to a long edge state coherence length. In the quantum Hall context for example, edge state decoherence has been studied using Mach-Zehnder interferometry, demonstrating coherence lengths up to 100 μm. Since each quantum operation is performed within L≈1 μm, it should be possible to perform many qubit operations before decoherence sets in. An implementation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer on the surface of an AFM TI would open the path to the study of coherent transport in this exciting new family of materials.

Various embodiments disclosed herein demonstrate the use of antiferromagnetic topological insulators to realize robust quantum point junctions at their surfaces due to the existence of two types of chiral channels (domain-wall and step) appearing on their surfaces. By identifying the two incoming channels with the two “code” states of a qubit, the results show that the S matrix of the quantum point junction acts as a single-qubit gate rotating the state vector of the qubit to produce the two outgoing channels. Furthermore, it is shown that magnetic and electrostatic tips from scanning tunneling microscopy can modify the junction so that its S matrix can perform any rotation on the Bloch sphere, realizing a universal one-qubit gate. In addition, the considered effects of symmetries and disorder and have illustrated that these affects can be “gauged” away through calibrating the junction. Finally, the discussion herein of the potential applications of the novel quantum point junction provide the basic unit for various other novel devices with applications in quantum computing and sensing.

Various methods according to the embodiments are also provided, such as the following:

Method A: Model Hamiltonian. Consider an adaptation of a simple four-band tight-binding model proposed by Bernevig et al. to describe systems exhibiting a topological phase transition mediated by a single band inversion at Γ. The simplicity of the model makes detailed calculations practical even for large systems. The model is written in terms of two spinful orbitals per lattice site and takes the form:

\(\begin{matrix}
{H_{0} = {{m{\sum_{\ell}{c_{\ell}^{\dagger}\tau^{z}c_{\ell}}}} + {\frac{t}{2}{\sum_{\ell\ell\prime}^{\prime}{c_{\ell}^{\dagger}\tau^{z}c_{\ell\prime}}}} + {\frac{{- i}\lambda}{2}{\sum_{\ell\ell\prime}^{\prime}{c_{\ell}^{\dagger}\tau^{x}{{\hat{n}}_{\ell\ell\prime} \cdot \sigma}c_{\ell^{\prime}}}}} + {m_{z}{\sum_{\ell}{( - )^{\ell_{z}}c_{\ell}^{\dagger}\sigma^{z}c_{\ell}}}}}} & (8)
\end{matrix}\)

Here  labels a lattice site =(x, y, z) on the unit cubic lattice, indicates a sum over nearest neighbor sites, and {circumflex over (n)}, is the nearest neighbor unit vector. Adopting an implied sum notation for the orbital and spin degrees of freedom, illustratively τμσν=Σij,stτijμσstνjt, where τ and σ are Pauli matrices for orbital and spin degrees of freedom respectively, and  creates an electron on site  on orbital i with spin s.

The first three terms in Eq. (8) correspond to the model of Bernevig et al. for a strong topological insulator, often written in k-space as HST1(k)=mτz+Σi=x,t,ztcos(ki)τz+λsin(ki)τxσi. In the last term in Eq. (8), mz is the strength of the staggered Zeeman field corresponding to A-type (layered) AFM order, doubling the unit cell and converting the model to represent an AFM topological insulator. Time reversal itself is now broken, but time reversal followed by a unit translation along {circumflex over (z)} is a good symmetry. For the choice of parameters, the model is in the topological phase, with a formal magnetoelectric coupling of (θ/2π)(e2/h) with axion coupling θ=π. As a result, {circumflex over (z)}-normal surfaces are naturally gapped and carry an anomalous Hall conductivity of ±e2/2h.

Method B: Wave-packet construction. Construct the initial WPs in the space of momentum k∥ along the direction of propagation. Calculate the surface band structure for a supercell Hamiltonian Hdw or Hst containing a domain wall or step, whose presence results in mid-gap bands localized on the conducting channels in the otherwise gapped surface, as shown in FIG. 1(c) and (d), respectively. Note that technically each slab contains two domain walls and two steps. In the domain wall case, the configuration as a whole is invariant under time reversal times inversion, so the bands shown are Kramers degenerate.

Next, construct the WP by making a quantum superposition of channel-localized solutions according to a k∥-space envelope function that is taken to be a Gaussian. This results in a WP that is localized in all three real space dimensions. This is then used as the initial wave function Ψ(0) of the time-evolution problem for the much larger system that includes the QPJ and is described by the Hamiltonian HQPJ. Having defined HQPJ as the model Hamiltonian H0 in the presence of an antiferromagnetic domain wall and a single-height step that intersect in the center of the surface.

Method C: Wave-packet dynamics. To avoid finite-size effects, the system size L should be much larger than the extent of the WPs along the channel. When both a domain wall and step are present, momentum is no longer a good quantum number in any direction, so compute the time evolution entirely in real space. This is done using Chebyshev series expansion methods applied to the time-evolution operator e−iHt. Using slabs of size 160×160 in-plane and 16 cells thick, enough to minimize finite-size effects, and adopt a Chebyshev expansion order of NC=211 so that the method may time evolve the state accurately over the needed time intervals.

Method D: STM tip modeling. To model the effects of the magnetic and electrostatic STM tips, extend the QPJ Hamiltonian (HQPJ) with two spatially dependent terms

{tilde over (H)}QPJ=HQPJ+VZσz+VG  (9)

where the second term modifies the Zeeman interaction in a region ΩZ and the third term shifts the energy of all orbitals and spins uniformly inside a region ΩG.

For a positive VZ in Eq. (9), choose the region ΩZ such that it restricts the sum to surface orbitals that lie within a radius r of the tip, and that already experience a negative Zeeman field from the bulk Hamiltonian of Eq. (8). Thus, VZ=mz is just enough to remove the Zeeman field from these sites, and VZ=2mz makes the surface-layer Zeeman field equal on both sides of the domain wall or step, as in FIG. 4(a). Then tune between these extremes by taking VZ∈[0, 2mz], thus modeling cases in which the magnetic tip has only partially reversed the surface field. Similarly, for VZ<0, ΩZ is chosen such that the second term in Eq. (9) is restricted to surface orbitals experiencing a positive Zeeman field in the bulk Hamiltonian.

The region of influence of the electrostatic tip, ΩG in Eq. (9), is defined to be a rectangle centered at (x0, y0) relative to the QPJ and one unit cell deep, as shown by the grey shading in FIG. 4(d). A WP propagating for a distance  along any domain-wall or step channel lying inside the quantum well defined by ΩG acquires an additional phase proportional to Δk, where Δk is the shift of the Fermi wavevector of the channel. In the approximation of linear dispersion, Δk=VG/νF, where VG corresponds to a local gate voltage and νF is the Fermi velocity (equal to νdw and νst for domain-wall and step channels respectively). Thus, the off-centering of ΩG defined by (x0, y0) allows control of the travel distances  along each of the four “legs” near the junction, introducing extra phases that are given by the following, as used in Eq. (7):
