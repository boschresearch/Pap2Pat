    "date": "2020-11-20 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A closed, automated and scalable stirred tank bioreactor platform, capable of sustaining high fold expansion of hPSCs is provided. hPSCs are expanded in a controlled bioreactor using perfused xeno-free media. Cell harvest and concentration are performed in closed steps. The hPSCs can be cryopreserved to generate a bank of cells or further processed as needed. Cryopreserved cells can be thawed into a 2D tissue culture platform or a 3D bioreactor to initiate a new expansion phase or be differentiated to the clinically relevant cell type. The expanded hPSCs express hPSC-specific markers, have a normal karyotype and the ability to differentiate to the cells of the three germ layers. This end-to-end platform allows large expansion of high quality hPSCs that can support the required cell demand for various clinical indications.",

                        "Stem cell technology has revolutionized regenerative medicine, ushering in a new era focused on curative therapies rather than disease management. Over the past decade, efforts toward the development and optimization of cGMP compliant, large-scale manufacturing of cell-based therapies have significantly increased. However, industrialization of stem-cell based therapies requires innovative solutions to close the gap between research and commercialization. For instance, scalable cell production platforms are needed to reliably deliver the cell quantities needed during the various stages of development and commercial supply.",
                        "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a key source material for generating therapeutic cell types, and successful generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by somatic cell reprogramming has opened new avenues in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug development. Capable of self-renewal and pluripotency, hiPSCs derived from patients of both normal and aberrant phenotypes provide a theoretically limitless supply of clinically relevant iPSC-derived cells without existing limitations and immune-rejection. For instance, given the heart's limited to no regenerative capacity, new cardiomyocytes can instead be derived from hiPSCs by modulating developmental cues critical in embryonic development in vivo.",
                        "Essential to the successful differentiation of iPSCs to a specific cell lineage, however, includes careful consideration of the microenvironment and method with which iPSCs are maintained. While a wealth of information has been gained through the use of traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture, this system fails to generate the number of cells required in many therapies in a cost-effective manner and does not fully recapitulate in vivo conditions.",
                        "For instance, to replace the number of cells lost during a myocardial infarction, for example, approximately 1\u00d7109 cells are required per patient dose. Given that 2D-based cell culture platforms are non-scalable with minimal capacity for expansion, achieving high cell densities in a 2D system would involve costly arrangements including extensive manual effort, laboratory space and personnel. These platforms also often do not possess adequate systems to control or monitor parameters such as the production of key metabolites by hiPSCs in culture. Moreover, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes remain phenotypically immature despite a number of studies demonstrating enhanced maturation through modulation of existing methodologies.",
                        "A number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of hPSC expansion in suspension cultures using aggregate and microcarrier (MC)-based three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. Aggregate-based 3D culture provides a more physiologically relevant microenvironment, but has been shown not only to require the small molecule, Y27632, for the survival of hPSCs, but also sequential passaging to achieve high fold expansion. Not without its own advantages, microcarrier-based culture systems facilitate larger surface area to volume ratio for scalability, provide large surface area for adhesion and growth during expansion, flexibility in using defined extracellular matrices, and allow maintenance of homogenous culture conditions.",
                        "Therefore, it would be a benefit to provide a cGMP compliant, commercially viable, scalable process to generate large numbers of high quality hPSCs. Further, it would be beneficial to provide an end-to end platform and process for hPSC expansion that solves one or more of the above problems, and/or that provides a microcarrier based expansion that uses xeno-free culture conditions. Moreover, it would be a benefit to provide an end-to-end platform and process where cells are expanded in a closed, automated and controlled single-use stirred tank bioreactor. Additionally or alternatively, it would be beneficial to provide a closed step of harvest and separation from the MCs, as well as concentrating the cells using a closed, automated centrifugation system, where the cells may be further cryopreserved. It would also be beneficial if the cryopreserved cells may also serve as the starting material, (e.g., cryopreserved hPSCs) that can be either thawed into 2D culture prior to inoculation or thawed directly into a bioreactor. It would be an additional benefit if an end-to-end platform that solved one or more of the above problems while also achieving a high expansion fold of >50 using the platform within 9-14 days of culture. Furthermore, it would be advantageous if the expanded hPSCs demonstrate high quality of self-renewal and pluripotency, and/or are capable of differentiation to all three germ layers. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide an end-to-end platform that does not require the use of a 2D seed train."

In an aspect, a non-enzymatic passaging solution is used to separate the microcarriers from the expanded pluripotent stem cells. Additionally or alternatively, in one aspect, after passaging with the non-enzymatic passaging solution, the pluripotent stem cells and plurality of microcarriers are run through a mesh having a mesh size sufficient to allow the pluripotent stem cells to pass through while restricting passage of the microcarriers. In one aspect, the mesh size is about 10 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm.",

In an aspect, a flow rate into the continuous centrifugation device is selected that allows formation of a fluidized bed in about 15 minutes or less. Furthermore, in one aspect, cell retention in the fluidized bed is about 80% or greater.",

                        "In general, the present disclosure is directed to a large scale, closed system, end-to-end platform, and process related thereto, for the manufacture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that demonstrates excellent growth, expansion, recovery, and viability. Particularly, the present disclosure has developed a microcarrier-based bioreactor suspension platform to expand hiPSCs to cell densities of >2\u00d7109 cells/L using xeno-free, fully defined hPSC medium with a closed, automated process for hiPSC harvest and concentration, and extensively characterized the expanded hiPSCs. For instance, the present disclosure has found that an end-to-end platform, and related process, according to the present disclosure allows for excellent cell growth and expansion even when using lower seeding densities and/or when using larger microcarriers than previously believed. Furthermore, the present disclosure has found that an end-to-end platform, and related process, according to the present disclosure may exhibit markedly improved cell recovery and viability, even after concentration and cryopreservation. In addition, the present disclosure has unexpectedly found that cells expanded according to the present disclosure may be used to seed further expansions, allowing for 2D seed train growth to be avoided.",
                        "Referring first to FIG. 1A, an exemplary schematic for an end-to-end hPSC expansion platform 100 and process related thereto, will be discussed. Of course, as noted above, in one aspect, step two (104) and three (106) may be eliminated by using cryopreserved cells expanded according to the end-to-end platform 100 and process as will be described herein.",
                        "Nonetheless, in one aspect, cryopreserved cells are used to inoculate a 2D seed train flask 104. The cryopreserved cells 102 may be cryopreserved cells generally known in the art, such as cells cryopreserved in CryoStor10 and commercially available. However, in one aspect, the cryopreserved cells 102 may be cells cryopreserved 116 according to the end-to-end platform 100 and process described herein. Thus, in one aspect, the cryopreserved cells 102 are cells cryopreserved 116 in a prior batch of expanded cells.",
                        "Regardless of whether the cryopreserved cells 102 were formed according to the present disclosure or were otherwise acquired, in one aspect, the cryopreserved cells 102 can be thawed into a 2D seed train flask 104. The cells may be inoculated at a seed density of about 0.01\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.1\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.015\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.05\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.02\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.04\u00d7106 cells/cm2.",
                        "In one aspect, a kinase inhibitor, such as rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase inhibitor (ROCKi) may be initially used with the thawed cells in the 2D seed train flask in addition to a nutrient matrix. However, after a period of time, such as about 24 hours or less, such as about 22 hours or less, such as about 20 hours or less, such as about 18 hours or less, such as about 16 hours or less, the kinase and nutrient matrix combination is replaced with an appropriate cell nutrient medium/matrix that is, in one aspect, generally free of kinase inhibitors. As used herein, a nutrient media or matrix refers to any fluid, compound, molecule, or substance that can increase the mass of a bioproduct, such as anything that may be used by an organism to live, grow or otherwise add biomass. For example, a nutrient feed can include a gas, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide that is used for respiration or any type of metabolism. Other nutrient media can include carbohydrate sources. Carbohydrate sources include complex sugars and simple sugars, such as glucose, maltose, fructose, galactose, and mixtures thereof. A nutrient media can also include an amino acid. The amino acid may comprise, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine, cysteine, lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, single stereoisomers thereof, and racemic mixtures thereof. The term \u201camino acid\u201d can also refer to the known non-standard amino acids, e.g., 4-hydroxyproline, c-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, O-phosphoserine, \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, \u03b3-N-acetyllysine, \u03c9-N-methylarginine, N-acetylserine, N,N,N-trimethylalanine, N-formylmethionine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, histamine, dopamine, thyroxine, citrulline, ornithine, \u03b2-cyanoalanine, homocysteine, azaserine, and S-adenosylmethionine. In some embodiments, the amino acid is glutamate, glutamine, lysine, tyrosine or valine.",
                        "The nutrient media can also contain one or more vitamins. Vitamins that may be contained in the nutrient media include group B vitamins, such as B12. Other vitamins include vitamin A, vitamin E, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, and mixtures thereof. The nutrient media can also contain one or more fatty acids and one or more lipids. For example, a nutrient media feed may include cholesterol, steroids, and mixtures thereof. A nutrient media may also supply proteins and peptides to the bioreactor. Proteins and peptides include, for instance, albumin, transferrin, fibronectin, fetuin, and mixtures thereof. A growth medium within the present disclosure may also include growth factors and growth inhibitors, trace elements, inorganic salts, hydrolysates, and mixtures thereof. Trace elements that may be included in the growth medium include trace metals. Examples of trace metals include cobalt, nickel, and the like. For instance, and for example only, in one aspect, the nutrient medium/matrix may be L7\u2122 hPSC matrix medium sold by Lonza.",
                        "Nonetheless, the thawed cells are seeded for growth in the 2D seed train flask 104 and maintained in the 2D seed train flask 104 until the cells reach a confluence of about 50% to about 100%, such as about 55% to about 95%, such as about 60% to about 90%, such as about 70% to about 85% confluence. For instance, in one aspect, the cells may be maintained in the 2D seed train flack 104 for about 3 days to about 9 days, such as about 4 days to about 8 days, such as about 5 days to about 7 days, in order to achieve the desired confluence and/or cell number.",
                        "After the cells have reached an appropriate confluence, the cells contained in the 2D seed train flask 104 may be passaged to a 2D seed train one-layer cell stack 106. While any passaging may be used as known in the art, in one aspect, in order to further improve cell viability and retention, a non-enzymatic cell detachment formulation may be used. For instance, in one aspect, the passaging solution may be a sodium citrate based passaging solution, such as a hypertonic sodium citrate solution, which may, in one aspect, be non-animal origin. Furthermore, in one aspect, the sodium citrate passaging solution may also include at least one salt and a liquid, such as, for example only, L7\u2122hPSC Passaging Solution sold by Lonza.",
                        "Regardless of the passaging solution selected, the cells are placed in the 2D seed train cell stack 106 at a seeding density of about 0.01\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.05\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.015\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.04\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.02\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.03\u00d7106 cells/cm2. Once seeded, the cells are maintained in the 2D seed train cell stack 106 until the cells reach a confluence of about 50% to about 100%, such as about 55% to about 95%, such as about 60% to about 90%, such as about 70% to about 85% confluence. For instance, in one aspect, the cells may be maintained in the 2D seed train trays 106 for about 3 days to about 9 days, such as about 4 days to about 8 days, such as about 5 days to about 7 days, in order to achieve the desired confluence and/or cell number.",
                        "Nonetheless, after the desired cell number and/or confluence is obtained, the cells contained in the 2D seed train cell stack 106 may be harvested using a passaging solution. The passaging solution may be the same as the passaging solution discussed above or may instead use a second passaging solution. Regardless of the passaging solution selected, the harvested cells may be used to inoculate a stirred tank bioreactor 108, which may be referred to as a bioreactor herein, in order to undergo cell expansion.",
                        "In general, any suitable bioreactor may be used. The bioreactor, for instance, may comprise a fermenter, a stirred-tank reactor, an adherent bioreactor, a wave-type bioreactor, a disposable bioreactor, and the like. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1B, the bioreactor 10 comprises a hollow vessel or container that includes a bioreactor volume 12 for receiving a cell culture within a fluid growth medium. As shown in FIG. 1B, the bioreactor system can further include a rotatable shaft 14 coupled to an agitator such as dual impellers 16 and 18.",
                        "The bioreactor 10 can be made from various materials. In one embodiment, for instance, the bioreactor 10 can be made from metal, such as stainless steel. Metal bioreactors are typically designed to be reused.",
                        "Alternatively, the bioreactor 10 may comprise a single use bioreactor made from a rigid polymer or a flexible polymer film. When made from a rigid polymer, for instance, the bioreactor walls can be free standing. Alternatively, the bioreactor can be made from a flexible polymer film or shape conforming material that can be liquid impermeable and can have an interior hydrophilic surface. In one aspect, the bioreactor 10 can be made from a flexible polymer film that is designed to be inserted into a rigid structure, such as a metal container for assuming a desired shape. Polymers that may be used to make the rigid vessel or flexible polymer film include polyolefin polymers, such as polypropylene and polyethylene. Alternatively, the polymer can be a polyamide.

For example, in one embodiment, lactate concentration is measured within the cell culture in conjunction with at least one other lactate influencing parameter. The lactate influencing parameter can comprise, for instance, glutamate concentration, glucose concentration, an amino acid concentration such as asparagine concentration, or the like. In one embodiment, at line or off line analysis of the cell culture can be performed using any suitable instruments such as a NOVA Bioprofile 400 analyzer sold by Nova Biomedical.

The controller includes a control model that, based on the inputted data, is capable of forecasting lactate concentration in the future as the cell culture continues to propagate. In one embodiment, for instance, the controller can provide an early warning system that produces a percent probability as to whether the lactate concentration at the end of the cell culture incubation period is within preset limits or if the cell culture will end in a lactate accumulating state. The controller 60 can also be configured to accurately predict lactate concentration into the future. For instance, in one embodiment, the controller can forecast a lactate concentration trajectory that predicts lactate concentration through the entire incubation period until the cell culture is harvested. In one embodiment, the controller can also be configured to suggest or automatically implement corrective actions in case lactate concentration is not within preset limits. For example, the controller can be configured to determine nutrient feed changes, or changes in other operating conditions that may be required to drive the lactate concentration to a desired value. In order to determine corrective actions, the controller may run multiple iterations for determining future lactate concentrations based on altering one or more conditions within the bioreactor until an optimized change in one or more conditions is selected.",

                        "Nonetheless, in one aspect, microcarriers may also be present in the bioreactor in addition to the nutrient medium prior to inoculating the bioreactor. In one aspect, the microcarriers may be introduced into the bioreactor along with the nutrient medium, or may be added after the nutrient medium but prior to inoculation. In a further aspect, the above discussed volume of nutrient media may be present in the bioreactor, and the microcarriers may be added after the initial volume of nutrient media but may be incorporated as part of a second volume of nutrient media. In such an aspect, the second volume of nutrient media containing the microcarriers may be about 10% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 15% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 20% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 25% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 20% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 33% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, such as about 35% or less of the volume of the bioreactor, and, in one aspect, a volume of the nutrient medium may be placed in the bioreactor such that the nutrient medium has a volume of about 30% to about 40% of the volume of the bioreactor.",

For instance, cells can adhere to the surface of the microcarriers for further growth and propagation. In this manner, the microcarriers can provide greater surface area for cell culture growth within the reactor. In fact, some anchorage-dependent cells, such as certain animal cells, need to attach to a surface in order to grow and divide. In some systems, the microcarriers are suspended within a nutrient medium caused by general agitation prior to, during, and/or after introduction to the bioreactor, which optimizes and maximizes the growing conditions within the bioreactor system.",
                        "Microcarriers can be made from various different materials, including polymers. The microcarriers can have any suitable shape and, in some applications, comprise round beads. In one aspect, microcarriers can generally have a median particle size of from about 50 \u03bcm to about 350 \u03bcm, such as from about 75 \u03bcm to about 300 \u03bcm, such as from about 100 \u03bcm to about 250 \u03bcm, such as from about 125 \u03bcm to about 225 \u03bcm, or any ranges or values therebetween. Previously, it was believed that small microcarriers (e.g. about 90-150 \u03bcm) were necessary for optimal expansion. However, the present disclosure has unexpectedly found that larger microcarriers (e.g. greater than 125 \u03bcm) may be used in combination with the process described herein, and yield expansion results, as good as, or better than results obtained with small microcarriers. Therefore, in one aspect, the microcarriers have a median particle size of about 125 \u03bcm or greater, such as about 150 \u03bcm or greater, such as about 175 \u03bcm or greater, such as about 200 \u03bcm or greater, such as about 210 \u03bcm or greater, such as about 350 \u03bcm or less, such as about 325 \u03bcm or less, such as about 300 \u03bcm or less, such as about 275 \u03bcm or less, such as about 250 \u03bcm or less, or any ranges or values therebetween. This provides a further benefit as small microcarriers are difficult to obtain, often requiring specialized equipment, thus larger particle sizes allow greater flexibility in scale-up of end-to-end expansion platforms.",
                        "Furthermore, in one aspect, the microcarriers may also be coated with a nutrient medium prior to introduction to a bioreactor and/or suspension in a nutrient medium. Particularly, the present disclosure has found that iPSCs showed improved growth and expansion when used with coated microcarriers as compared to uncoated microcarriers. Thus, in one aspect, the microcarriers may be coated with a nutrient matrix as discussed, such as a nutrient matrix as discussed above. Furthermore, in one aspect, the microcarriers may be coated in the same medium in which they are (or will be) suspended, or alternatively, may be coated in a different medium than the nutrient medium in which they will be supported. In yet a further aspect, the medium may be largely the same for coating and the support medium, but the coating medium and/or support medium may have one or more different additives.",
                        "Notwithstanding the nutrient medium and microcarriers selected, the bioreactor may be inoculated with cells as discussed above at a seeding density of about 0.01\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.2\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.02\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.15\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.03\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.1\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 0.04\u00d7106 cells/cm2 to about 0.07\u00d7106 cells/cm2. Particularly, as discussed above, it was previously believed that a high seeding density of 0.2\u00d7106 cells/cm2 was necessary for a 3 L or larger bioreactor to yield good expansion results. However, as will be discussed in greater detail below in regards to FIGS. 4 and 5, the present disclosure has found that small seeding densities (e.g. lower than 0.2\u00d7106 cells/cm2) may be used in conjunction with the present disclosure, and yield excellent expansion results.",
                        "For instance, the present disclosure has found that low seeding densities may actually allow for higher fold expansion than higher seeding densities, such as a fold expansion of about 50 times or greater, such as about 60 times or greater, such as about 70 times or greater, such as about 80 times or greater, such as about 90 times or greater, such as about 100 times or greater, such as, in one aspect, about 50 times to about 120 times, such as about 60 times to about 100 times, such as about 70 times to about 95 times, such as about 80 times to about 90 times, or any ranges or values therebetween. Furthermore, the present disclosure has found that, unexpectedly, the expansion may take less time than an incubation that begins with a higher seeding density. For instance, the above expansions may take place in about 7 to about 18 days, such as about 8 to about 16 such as about 9 to about 14 days, and in one aspect, may reach a desired expansion (or seeding density) at a time less than a platform seeded with a high seeding density.",
                        "As discussed above, in one aspect, after the nutrient media, microcarriers, and inoculum have been introduced to the bioreactor, the contents of the bioreactor may be subjected to agitation. In one aspect, the bioreactor may be subjected to continuous gentle agitation at about 25 rpm to about 125 rpm, such as about 35 rpm to about 110 rpm, such as about 40 rpm to about 100 rpm, such as about 45 rpm to about 95 rpm, such as about 50 rpm to about 90 rpm, or any ranges or values therebetween. However, in a further aspect, the present disclosure has found that cell expansion may be further improved by a stepped agitation based upon cell density. For instance, in one aspect, the agitation may be increased every other day, such as every third day, such as every fourth day, such as every fifth day, by increasing the rpms by at least about 5 rpms, such as at least about 10 rpms, such as at least about 15 rpms, such as at least about 20 rpms, such as at least about 25 rpms, such as about 30 rpms or less.",
                        "Additionally or alternatively, the increase in rpms may be based upon a cell density measurement. For instance, in one aspect, the initial agitation speed may be set to about 25 rpm to about 75 rpm, such as about 35 rpm to about 65 rpm, such as about 40 rpm to about 60 rpm, such as about 45 rpm to about 55 rpm. Cell density measurements may be conducted, and when a cell density reaches about about 1\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 10\u00d7105 cells/cm2, such as about 3\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 8\u00d7105 cells/cm2, such as about 5\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 7\u00d7105 cells/cm2, an agitation speed may be increased by about 5 rpms, such as at least about 10 rpms, such as at least about 15 rpms, such as at least about 20 rpms, such as at least about 25 rpms, such as about 30 rpms or less.",
                        "Furthermore, in one aspect, after the agitation speed may be increased at least a second time. For instance, cell density measurements may be conducted again (or continuously conducted), and when a cell density reaches about about 4\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 5\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 4.5\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 4\u00d7106 cells/cm2, such as about 5\u00d7105 cells/cm2 to about 3\u00d7106 cells/cm2, an agitation speed may be increased again by about 5 rpms, such as at least about 10 rpms, such as at least about 15 rpms, such as at least about 20 rpms, such as at least about 25 rpms, such as about 30 rpms or less.",
                        "In one aspect, the present disclosure has also found that discontinuous agitation on seeding day (first 24 hours of incubation) may further improve cell viability and expansion. Furthermore, the present disclosure has found that the discontinuous agitation may also be cascading agitation, such that earlier agitation is shorter, with increasing length of agitation and decreasing rest between agitation as time progresses. For instance, please refer to the characterization curve in 5.20.3 below. In such an aspect, the discontinuous and/or discontinuous cascading agitation may take place for the first 24 hours or less after inoculation, such as about 20 hours or less, such as about 18 hours or less, such as about 14 hours or less, such as about 10 hours or less after inoculation.",
                        "Nonetheless, when a desired cell density is reached, the expanded cells may be harvested 110. Namely, in one aspect, the expanded cells may be passaged and separated from the microcarriers by a non-enzymatic passaging solution, which may be the same passaging solution as discussed above, or may be a second passaging solution. Additionally, it should be understood that the passaging solution as discussed above may also include a kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, in one aspect, the passaging solution may also be combined with a nutrient media for passaging the cells from the bioreactor to the harvesting bag 110. Regardless, in one aspect, the cells are separated from the microcarriers by using an appropriate passaging solution, and are passed through a mesh having a mesh size selected to catch the microcarriers while allowing the cells to proceed through tubing to the harvest bag. For instance, in one aspect, the harvest bag assembly may have a mesh having a mesh size of about 10 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, such as about 25 \u03bcm to about 75 \u03bcm, such as about 50 \u03bcm to about 70 \u03bcm, or any ranges or values therebetween.",
                        "After the expanded cells have been harvested, the cells may be concentrated 112, such as by centrifugation. In one aspect, a flow rate through the centrifuge is selected based upon the formation of a fluidized bed. For instance, a flow rate may be optimized in order to minimize the time needed to establish the fluidized bed, maximize cell recover, and maintain cell viability and proliferation. Particularly, the present disclosure has found that cell retention and viability may be increased by establishing a fluidized bed in a short amount of time (such as about 15 minutes or less, such as from about 9 to about 13 minutes, such as about 10 minutes to about 12 minutes, in one aspect), and by minimizing a percentage of cells escaping the fluidized bed. For instance, in one aspect, the optimized fluidized bed may retain about 70% or greater of the cells, such as about 80% or greater, such as about 90% or greater of the cells entering the fluidized bed.",
                        "Nonetheless, after concentration, the cells may be filled and 114 and preserved by cryopreservation as may be known in the art.",
                        "While passaging has been discussed during several steps of FIG. 1, it should be understood and acknowledged that, unexpectedly, no passaging is needed during the incubation time, namely that greater than ten-fold expansion can be achieved in a continuous suspension culture according to the present disclosure.",
                        "Furthermore, as mentioned above, while 2D seed train steps 104 and 106 have been discussed in regards to FIG. 1, it should be understood that the present disclosure has also found that 3D seed train cells formed according to the present disclosure may be used to directly inoculate the bioreactor 108. Thus, in one aspect, steps 104 and 106 may be eliminated, and instead, cryopreserved cells 116 may be used as cryopreserved cells 102, and placed directly into bioreactor step 108. This finding is important for continued scale up of the platform, as larger end-to-end platforms (such as larger volume platforms) require larger and larger numbers of cells for inoculation. Therefore, a process for producing 3D seed train cells enables continued growth of scale-up, as the number of cells produced via a 3 L end-to-end platform far exceed 2D seed train production over the same time period.",
                        "For instance, the present disclosure has found that an end-to-end platform using a process according to the present disclosure may yield about 1 million cells/mL to about 5 million cells/mL, such as about 1.5 million cells/mL to about 4.5 million cells/mL, such as about 2 million cells/mL to about 4 million cells/mL. Additionally, the present disclosure has found that the process and platform according to the present disclosure may exhibit a cell retention after concentration of about 70% or greater, such as about 75% or greater, such as about 80% or greater, such as about 85% or greater, such as about 90% or greater. This finding also provides a further benefit, as 2D seed train provides high risk of contamination in addition to being time consuming and difficult. Therefore, direct inoculation with 3D seed train may also improve a lowered risk of contamination.",
                        "Additionally, the present disclosure has found that the end-to-end platform may be configured to be a closed system, and, in one aspect, may use single use vessels and tubing. Therefore, the end-to-end platform may further lower risk of contamination.",
                        "Furthermore, while the discussion has thus far focused on human pluripotent stem cells, it should be understood that other appropriate cells may be selected to undergo expansion according to the process and platform discussed herein. Additionally, as may be understood by one having skill in the art, the iPSCs discussed herein may be used as intermediates for any number of cells, as, will be discussed in greater detail below, the iPSCs expanded herein show excellent viability and differentiation.",

                        "Referring first to FIG. 2, and as discussed above, it is shown that the process according to the present disclosure yields fold expansion of greater than 10 over a seventeen-day period. For instance, the hPSC culture system discussed herein, which, in this example, includes the L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC medium and matrix, supported the expansion of the hiPSCs tested in manually operated, open, spinner flasks and in automated, closed, stirred tank bioreactors. Particularly, RTiPSC4i and RTiPSC3B cells cultured in a xeno-free nutrient media supplemented with growth factors and cytokines optimized for long-term growth, were shown to exhibit excellent growth and expansion. Thus, in this example, L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC medium supported human iPSC generation from somatic cells such as fibroblast and PBMNCs. Furthermore, while the data is not shown, maintenance of various hESC and hiPSC lines in conventional 2D cell culture platforms, which utilize cell culture vessels coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix to support cell attachment, was also supported. To assess the ability of L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC media to support growth of hPSCs in suspension, 2D cultured RTiPSC3B and RTiPSC4i cells were harvested as cell clumps and inoculated in L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC medium at a cell density of 0.2\u00d7106 cells/mL, with microcarriers 90-150 \u03bcM in diameter coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix. As indicated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, an initial decrease in cell number was observed during the first days in suspension followed by an increase in cell number, which reached >2\u00d7106 cells/mL on day 17 (>10-fold expansion). The results indicate that L7\u2122 TFO2 media supports MC-based expansion of hPSCs in suspension and that that 10-fold expansion could be achieved in a continuous suspension culture over 17 days without the need for cell passaging.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 3, the present disclosure has found that, contrary to prior teaching, larger diameter microcarriers (MCs) support expansion of HPSCs as well as, if not better, than small diameter microcarriers. Spinner flasks were inoculated with 0.2\u00d7106 cells/mL of RTiPSC3B in the presence of 90-150 \u03bcM (small) or 125-212 \u03bcM (large) sized MCs coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix. Similar cell growth and expansion over 17 days was observed when using small and large sized MCs. In both conditions, cells reached >2\u00d7106 cells/mL and >10-fold expansion on a similar day during culture. These results validate the use of larger sized MCs for cell expansion.",
                        "In FIGS. 4 and 5, the present disclosure has shown that, contrary to prior teaching, lower inoculation density does not compromise cell yield, and instead leads to higher fold expansion. To generate high cell numbers in suspension systems such as a 3 L bioreactor with an inoculum cell density of 0.2\u00d7106 cells/mL, would require 600\u00d7106 cells at inoculation. Spinner flasks were inoculated with RTiPSC4i cells at two different cell densities: 0.2\u00d7106 cells/mL and 0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL. The cells were cultured in suspension for 17 days and cell counts determined at various time points during the expansion period. FIG. 4 shows that comparable cell densities were achieved at both inoculum cell densities. The spinner flasks inoculated with a higher cell density resulted in 3\u00d7106 cells/mL, while inoculating with a lower cell density resulted in 2.5\u00d7106 cells/mL on day 17. Comparison of expansion fold results demonstrates that the higher density seeding resulted in \u02dc15-fold expansion by day 17, which is comparable to expansion fold described above in FIG. 2. However, the lower seeding density inoculum, which used five times fewer hiPSCs at inoculation, resulted in 90-fold expansion on day 17. This fold expansion is \u02dc6 times higher than that obtained using the higher seeding density.",
                        "To confirm these findings with a different hiPSC line, the present disclosure inoculated RTiPSC3B cells at a cell density of 0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL with either small or large sized coated MCs. FIG. 5 demonstrated cell growth and fold expansion over 16 days. Cell yield reached >1.6\u00d7106 cells/mL with expansion fold of >40 on either small or large sized MCs. Thus, the present disclosure has found that hiPSCs inoculated at lower cell densities are capable of achieving higher-fold expansion, easing the burden of large-scale expansion in 2D cell culture platforms prior to inoculation in 3D suspension culture.",
                        "Referring next to FIGS. 6 and 7, as discussed above the present disclosure has found that coating microcarriers in nutrient matrix may further enable hPSC attachment to the microcarriers. Cells were harvested from 2D cell culture using L7\u2122 Passaging solution and seeded as cell clumps in spinner flasks at a density of 0.2\u00d7106 cells/m L. Both flasks contained microcarriers, where in one flask the microcarriers were coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix and in the other, the microcarriers were not coated. While cell viability on day 0 (inoculation day) was determined to be 85%, a cell count performed on day 3 revealed a decrease in cell number. This observation matches previous results for reduced cell density in the first days in suspension (FIGS. 2 and 3). On day 7, however, cells that were seeded with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix-coated MCs showed both high viability (90%) and 2-fold expansion. Cells that were seeded with uncoated MCs failed to show growth and expansion. The results show that coating the MCs improves cell expansion. The experiment was repeated with a lower seeding cell density of 0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL. LiPSC18R cells were inoculated in a spinner flask with either coated or uncoated MCs. Monitoring cell growth over 7 days showed that expansion was minimal in the spinner flask where cells were incubated with uncoated MCs, compared to 10-fold expansion on day 7 in the spinner flask where cells were incubated with coated MCs.",
                        "To rule out the possibility that the cells expanded without MCs, RTiPSC4i cells were inoculated in spinner flasks with and without large sized MCs coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix as shown in FIG. 7. In the flask that had MCs, cell reached 70-fold expansion in 10 days, while no expansion was detected in the flask that did not have MCs.",
                        "Referring next to FIGS. 8 and 9, the present disclosure has further found that the process described herein is scalable to larger bioreactors. The spinner flask experiments demonstrated that hiPSCs expanded in L7\u2122 TFO2 media using L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix-coated MCs resulted in high-fold expansion. To demonstrate scalability, a 3D expansion system in 1 L (data not shown) and 3 L stirred tank bioreactors were conducted. Ten 3 L bioreactor runs were performed using three different hiPSC lines harvested from 2D culture as cell clumps. Cells were inoculated at a cell density range of 0.02-0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix-coated MCs (125-212 \u03bcM) and maintained in L7\u2122 TFO2 media, perfused at 1 vessel volume per day (VVD). Cell counts performed on single cells released from the MCs revealed an expansion of 5 to 20-fold in the first 5-9 days, and additional >10 fold expansion onward, resulting in >2\u00d7106 cells/mL (FIG. 8). An average 93-fold expansion within 9-16 days of culture across all three hiPSC cell lines was achieved in these culture conditions. Notably, although RTiPSC4i Run 2 used only 0.027\u00d7106 cells/mL at inoculation, approximately 80-fold expansion was still achieved in 11 days. This result supports the findings in the spinner flasks experiments, demonstrating that lower inoculum cell density does not compromise cell yield, supporting platform robustness. Cell viability along the various days of the bioreactors run was determined to be high (>85%, data not shown). Images of cell-MC samples taken from the bioreactor at various time points show cell expansion over time (FIG. 9).",
                        "Furthermore, referring to FIG. 10, various metabolites were monitored during incubation. Surprisingly, the present disclosure has found that iPSC cells may have excellent growth and expansion with lower than previously believed levels of dissolved oxygen. Nonetheless, key nutrients, such as glucose, and metabolites, such as lactate, were monitored during run. FIG. 10 shows a decrease in glucose levels, corresponding to increased glucose consumption as the cells expand in culture. Glucose concentrations did not drop below 2.4 g/L, even when cell density in the bioreactor reached 3.05\u00d7106 cells/mL (LiPSC18R Run 2). Conversely, lactate production increased with a maximum concentration of 1.79 g/L seen (LiPSC18R Run 2). For the other cells lines, lactate levels did not exceed 1.6 g/L even for high cell densities of 5.6\u00d7106 cells/mL (RTiPSC3B) or 5.1\u00d7106 cells/mL (RTiPSC4i). Additionally, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were closely monitored in real-time using the TruBio DV Software from Finesse Solutions. Similarly to the nutrient levels, pH levels were affected by cell expansion. While the set point was 7.2, as cells expanded, pH levels dropped to \u02dc6.8. Dissolved oxygen was set to 50% and maintained for the first few days of the run. As cell expanded, however, DO levels dropped and the Finesse controller could not maintain the set target. DO levels dropped to 30% for cell densities close to 2\u00d7106 cells/mL. For higher cell densities of >4\u00d7106 cells/m L, DO levels were below 10%.",
                        "Previous studies have demonstrated that 02 levels regulate hPSCs metabolic flux, but the expression of pluripotency and differentiation markers in hPSCs cultured in either 20% or 5% 02 was unaltered. Moreover as will be discussed in greater detail below, no differences in proliferation were observed, suggesting that low O2 improves hPSC stemness. Others have also shown that 30% DO is the optimal condition to support hPSC expansion. In line with this study, we did not observe an adverse impact on the quality of cells harvested at cell densities of \u02dc2.5\u00d7106 cells/mL where DO levels remained >30. Moreover, characterization of cells harvested from a 3 L bioreactor at a cell density of >5\u00d7106 cells/mL, with corresponding DO levels of 10%, showed that the cells had normal karyotype, expressed hPSC-associated markers and were capable of differentiating into cells of the three germ layers. These findings suggest minimal impact of 02 levels on the quality of cells expanded in the end-to-end platform discussed herein.",
                        "Furthermore, referring to FIGS. 11-13, the present disclosure has found that the hPSCs formed according to the present disclosure exhibited excellent morphology and expression of hPSC-associated markers. Namely, cell harvest from the bioreactor was performed in a closed manner inside the bioreactor. Medium was pumped out, and F3 non-enzymatic passaging solution was pumped in to release the cells from the microcarriers. As a result of F3 passaging solution treatment, cells were released from the microcarriers as single cells. The resulting solution of single cells and microcarriers in F3 passaging solution were then transferred in a closed manner through a separation bag to separate the cells from the microcarriers. The cells passed through the filter bag directly into a collection bag containing L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC media. In order to assess the quality of expanded hiPSCs post-harvest from a bioreactor, the cells were characterized for morphology, hPSC-associated markers, validated their karyotype, and determined their pluripotency.",
                        "To assess morphology, hiPSCs on MCs or MC-released hiPSCs were plated onto 2D cell culture plates coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix. FIG. 11 shows that RTiPSC3B and LiPSC18R cells, cultured in 2D culture plates after harvest from a 3 L bioreactor, had a typical hPSC colony morphology, including defined edges and tightly packed cells with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining of both cell lines shows qualitative expression of hPSC-associated markers (FIG. 12), while flow cytometry results further validated that >85% of the iPSCs expanded in the bioreactor expressed hPSC-associated markers post-harvest (FIG. 13). Karyotype analysis, reflected in Table 1 below, showed no genome abnormality in cells harvested from a bioreactor and cultured for one or more passages in 2D.",
                        "Furthermore, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, the potential of the expanded hiPSCs to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers was assessed either by embryoid body (EB) formation or by directed differentiation. FIG. 14 shows immunofluorescence staining images of plated EBs formed from RTiPSC3B cells expanded in a 3 L bioreactor. Positive detection of germ layer-specific markers demonstrates that cells expanded in a bioreactor retain their potential to give rise to cells of the three germ layers post-harvest. Directed differentiation of hiPSCs to definitive endoderm (DE, endoderm germ layer), neural stem cells (NSCs, ectoderm germ layer) and cardiomyocytes (CMs, mesoderm germ layer) was performed on RTiPSC3B and LiPSC18R cells after harvest from 3 L bioreactors. As shown in FIG. 15, immunostaining for germ-layer specific markers confirmed that the expanded cells retained pluripotency and capability to be directly differentiated to DE, NCSs and CMs. As described in Material and Methods section, immunostaining for CM-specific markers was performed after observing spontaneous contraction.",
                        "Referring next to FIGS. 16 and 17, as the manufacture of cell therapies advances towards larger scale cultures in bioreactors, more cells will be used for inoculation and more cells will need to be processed after harvesting. Common existing treatment of iPSCs after a bioreactor harvest is to have an operator wash out the culture media, concentrate the cells via benchtop centrifugation, and then re-suspend in cryoprotectant. Moving towards larger scale GMP production, this open step is a critical contamination risk to the product and ultimately to the patient who would receive it, and is difficult to scale. One solution is to make use of continuous centrifugation devices, for example a kSep400 continuous centrifugation system.",
                        "Optimization of the flow rate during fluidized bed formation was defined as (1) minimizing the time needed to establish the fluidized bed, (2) maximizing cell recovery, and (3) maintaining cell viability and proliferation capabilities. The establishment of the fluidized bed is achieved when the majority of cells coming into the kSep chamber are retained, and thus the percent of escaping cells reaches a minimum. Quantitatively, this can be defined as the escape percent dropping below 10%, meaning the fluidized bed captures 90% or more of the incoming cells.",
                        "The 30 mL/min and 35 mL/min established the fluidized bed in 10-11 minutes, and the 25 mL/min flow rate established the bed after 13-14 minutes (FIG. 6A). The cells from the 30 and 35 mL/min tests were taken for cell counts and culturing. The cell counts revealed that the cell viability was not negatively affected by the concentration process and that both protocols had recoveries 80% (see Table 2 below). The flow rate of 35 mL/min was selected for concentration of iPSCs in the kSep 400.50. This flow rate was scaled up to 120 mL/min when moving into the kSep400.",
                        "After establishing a possible flow rate (120 mL/min) for both the fluidized bed setting and the concentration steps, five bioreactor harvests were concentrated using the kSep400. For four of these runs, the waste stream exiting the kSep chamber was regularly sampled to monitor the formation and stability of the fluidized bed (FIG. 17). A fifth run was performed, but the formation of the fluidized bed was not monitored. In all four monitored runs, the fluidized bed formed within about 8 minutes (FIG. 17). Across all 5 runs, cell recovery was >90% and any loss in viability was 1.3% (see Table 3 below). It was possible to concentrate the cells up to 2.26\u00d7108 viable cells/mL. After concentration, the cells from each run were plated onto 2D and were subjected to quality testing (see discussion of FIGS. 18-21 below). In all of the kSep400 runs, at the very end of continuous concentration, a slight uptick was observed in the percent of viable cells escaping the fluidized bed (up to an additional 5%). It is unlikely that this uptick was due to exceeding chamber capacity; the same pattern observed in run 3 (\u02dc12\u00d7109 hiPSCs in the chamber) was observed in run 1 (\u02dc3\u00d7109 hiPSCs in the chamber). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it could have been due to cell settling in the feed bag, resulting in a sudden influx of concentrated cells (or cell clumps) that disturbed the fluidized bed.",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 18-21, quality assessments of the expanded hiPSCs post kSep included cell attachment, morphology, hPSC-associated marker expression, karyotype and pluripotency. Post kSep, single cell hiPSCs (RTiPSC3B and LiPSC18R cell line) were plated in two different cell densities on 2D cell culture plates coated with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix. The cells, cultured in L7\u2122 TFO2 medium, attached well and exhibited typical hPSC morphology (FIG. 18). Likewise, the cells expressed the hPSC markers as determined qualitatively by immunofluorescence staining and quantitatively by flow cytometry (FIGS. 19 and 29, respectively).",
                        "To determine whether cells concentrated by kSep are also capable of giving rise to all three germ layers, directed differentiation of RTiPSC3B and LiPSC18R cells post kSep was performed. As shown in FIG. 21, cells post expansion in a bioreactor, harvested as single cells and concentrated by kSep were capable of directly differentiating into neural stem cells, as seen by positive staining for PAX6 and NESTIN; definitive endoderm, as shown by positive staining for FOXA2 and SOX17; and cardiomyocytes, as seen by positive staining for SMA and \u03b1-ACTININ, post contraction. The karyotype of LiPSC18R from two independent bioreactor runs, followed by kSep concentration, was determined to be normal (see Table 1 above).",
                        "Referring next to FIGS. 22 and 23, cryopreservation of cell-based therapeutic products is a critical aspect of cell therapy. Master and working cell banks of iPSCs could be readily used for subsequent rounds of expansion and differentiation into the desired cell therapy product. A key hurdle, however, is maintaining the viability and performance of cryopreserved cells.",
                        "Human iPSCs expanded in a 3 L bioreactor and concentrated via kSep were cryopreserved in 1 mL of cryopreservation solution as described above. Cells at high viability of >85% were cryopreserved in various cell densities. The cryopreserved cells were thawed approximately two weeks after cryopreservation, and cell viability and vitality were determined. The viability of the thawed cells was similar across the various cryopreservation cell densities, however, lower than that before cryopreservation (see Table 4 below). Upon plating onto 2D cell culture plates, cells attached, expanded, had hPSC typical morphology and were positive for alkaline phosphatase staining (FIGS. 22 and 23). This data also shows the feasibility to cryopreserve hiPSCs to a high cell density of 120 and 240\u00d7106 cells/ml. This will shorten a 2D seed train for further processes involving cell expansion and differentiation.",
                        "Thus, FIGS. 22 and 23 demonstrate that hiPSCs cryopreserved at high cell densities after harvest and subsequent concentration by kSep can be recovered successfully. The cells retain hPSC characteristics as shown by morphology upon plating in 2D and expression of the hPSC-associated marker, alkaline phosphatase.",
                        "Next, it was examined whether the cryopreserved cells could be used to inoculate a 3 L bioreactor vessel (eliminating the need for a 2D seed train), while retaining their capability of self-renewal and differentiation. Generating sufficient cells in a 2D seed train required in order to provide adequate inoculum for a larger bioreactor is time consuming, highly manual and involves a process vulnerable to contamination. Moreover, given the variability typically observed between cell lines, culture of hPSCs by a 2D seed train depends on subjective decision making and often requires highly-trained personnel, capable of monitoring for culture irregularities, which could adversely impact subsequent cell expansion in a bioreactor. In order to overcome these challenges, the present disclosure has tested whether a 2D seed train could be avoided by thawing cryopreserved cells into a suspension culture.",
                        "LiPSC18R, cryopreserved as single cells, were thawed and inoculated into a spinner flask at a cell density of 0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL. In parallel, 2D cultured LiPSC18R cells were dissociated and inoculated as single cells into another spinner flask at the same cell density. Growth and expansion graphs demonstrate that cryopreserved and fresh single cell inoculum reach comparable cell density and fold expansion on day 9 (FIG. 24). To demonstrate scalability of these findings, a 3 L bioreactor was inoculated with LiPSC18R cells previously expanded in a 3 L bioreactor, concentrated by kSep400 and cryopreserved (0.068\u00d7106 cells/mL seeding density). Nine days after inoculation, cell density of 3.5\u00d7106 live cells/mL and total expansion >50-fold were achieved (FIG. 25). Representative phase contrast images show continued expansion of LiPSC18R on L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix-coated MCs over time in suspension culture (FIG. 26). Following harvest, concentration and cryopreservation of these cells, the quality of expanded cells was assessed. FIG. 27 shows the formation of colonies with typical morphology from single cells or cell clusters expanded on MCs. Moreover, representative immunofluorescence images and flow cytometry analyses confirmed expression of hPSC-associated markers (FIGS. 28, 29, respectively). Directed differentiation of these cells to the three germ layers was also confirmed by immunostaining for cell lineage-specific markers (FIG. 30). These results demonstrate that cryopreserved hiPSC inoculum are capable of expanding in a MC-based suspension system, resulting in a large number of high-quality hiPSCs.",
                        "Particularly, cell densities of >2\u00d7106 hiPSCs/mL were achieved upon inoculation of 0.02-0.07\u00d7106 cells/mL in a stirred tanked bioreactor (see Table 5). As the volume of the bioreactor increases, the amount of inoculum needs to increase proportionally. Generating this inoculum in a traditional manual and open 2D process is non-ideal with increased risk of execution failures.",
                        "However, the present disclosure demonstrates the feasibility of inoculating 3 L bioreactors with cryopreserved cells and achieving approximately 50-fold expansion, showing that a 2D seed train could be completely replaced by a closed 3D seed train. Nevertheless, to meet the required cell number for inoculation of 50 L or larger bioreactors, a considerably sized working cell bank derived from 2D cell culture or suspension culture system is still required. To circumvent this obstacle and mitigate challenges involved with large scale manufacturing of hPSCs, the present disclosure demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D seed train. Particularly, referring to FIG. 31, two conditions were tested: re-inoculation of cell-MC clusters from a spinner flask to a 3 L bioreactor (ConLiPSC18R cells) and transfer of single cells harvested from a spinner flask to a 3 L bioreactor (RTiPSC3B cells). In both conditions, cell density at inoculation was 0.04\u00d7106 cells/mL and cells were expanded with L7\u2122 hPSC Matrix-coated MCs. The cell-MC clusters from a spinner flask resulted in a maximum cell density of 2.92\u00d7106 LiPSC18R cells/mL, corresponding to >70-fold expansion in 12 days (FIG. 32), which is comparable to the results shown in FIG. 10 above. The single cells harvested from a spinner flask resulted in \u02dc70-fold expansion of RTiPSC3B cells on day 15, as determined by cell counts from a full harvest (FIG. 33), but, interestingly, exhibited a longer \u2018lag phase\u2019 that may be attributable to inoculating as single cells rather than cell clumps. Representative phase images of cell-MC clusters sampled from the bioreactor on day 2 and day 12 of the run, showing cell expansion (FIG. 34). FIG. 35 shows formation of colonies with typical morphology from single cells or cell clusters expanded on MCs, five days after harvest and plating onto 2D culture plates.",
                        "Additionally, representative immunofluorescence images (FIG. 36) showed the expression of hPSC-associated markers by RTiPSC3B cells expanded in a 3 L bioreactor through a 3D seed train (single cells harvested from a spinner flask). Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that >90% of cells expressed OCT3/4, SSEA-4, TRA-1-81 and Tra-1-60 (FIG. 37). Embryoid body formation assay showed that these cells have retained hPSC differentiation potential (FIG. 38). Based on the results described above, were able to successfully demonstrate that a 3D seed train could lead to high fold expansion of high quality cells, paving the way to commercial scale manufacturing of hPSCs.",
                        "Thus, the present disclosure has shown a microcarrier-based bioreactor suspension platform to expand hiPSCs to cell densities of >2\u00d7109 cells/L using xeno-free, fully defined hPSC medium with a closed, automated process for hiPSC harvest and concentration, and extensively characterized the expanded hiPSCs. The end-to-end platform hPSC culture system, which includes the L7\u2122 TFO2 hPSC medium and matrix, supported expansion of the hiPSCs tested in manually operated, open, spinner flasks and in automated, closed, stirred tank bioreactors. Feasibility experiments performed in spinner flasks inoculated with 0.2\u00d7106 cells/mL and microcarriers resulted in 10-fold expansion within 17 days without the need for cell passaging. Results were comparable to those previously published when assessing hESC growth on laminin-coated MCs. However, as discussed herein the cells did not require adaptation to suspension culture by pre-conditioning with the MCs in static culture conditions; rather, they could be inoculated directly.",
                        "In addition to the composition of the medium in which hPSCs are expanded, optimizing cell inoculum density is a factor in hiPSC expansion in suspension systems. Particularly, when lower and higher inoculum cell densities are compared, it shows that higher fold expansion can be achieved using lower seeding densities. Moreover, seeding density not only impacts the rate and quality of expansion, but also the cost, labor and expenditure of time associated with achieving the necessary cell density at inoculation.",
                        "Furthermore, the process described herein demonstrated scalability in 1 L or 3 L bioreactor vessels. Particularly, 6-15\u00d7109 cells per 3 L bioreactor run were successfully produced, (cell line and harvest day-dependent) meeting the number of cells required for a number of clinical indications. Furthermore, over 90-fold expansion was achieved within 9-16 days when using 2D cultured cells as bioreactor inoculum, which is a higher fold expansion than those achieved in spinner flask cultures. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this is likely attributable to better control of key parameters, which influence the rate of hiPSC expansion. The continuous media change, achieved through perfusion, facilitates control of key nutrients and metabolites such as glucose and lactate. pH was controlled via a one-sided control regime in which CO2 was used to reduce pH when it drifted above the set point of 7.2. FIG. 10 shows that this prevented pH from rising more than 0.1 units above set point. However, there was no active control to raise pH (such as base addition), only the passive gradual increase in pH brought about by off-gassing of CO2. Therefore, as cells expanded, pH dropped gradually to \u02dc6.8\u2032.",
                        "Upon increase in cell expansion, however, a reduction in DO levels was observed, which could not be maintained at the set target of 50% and reached 10% at cell densities >3\u00d7106 cells/mL. Previous studies have demonstrated that 02 levels regulate hPSCs metabolic flux, but the expression of pluripotency and differentiation markers in hPSCs cultured in either 20% or 5% 02 was unaltered. Moreover, no differences in proliferation were observed, suggesting that low 02 improves hPSC stemness. Others have also shown that 30% DO is the optimal condition to support hPSC expansion. In line with the present disclosure, an adverse impact on the quality of cells harvested at cell densities of \u02dc2.5\u00d7106 cells/mL where DO levels remained >30 was not observed. Moreover, characterization of cells harvested from a 3 L bioreactor at a cell density of >5\u00d7106 cells/m L, with corresponding DO levels of 10%, showed that the cells had normal karyotype, expressed hPSC-associated markers and were capable of differentiating into cells of the three germ layers. These findings suggest minimal impact of O2 levels on the quality of cells expanded in the platform according to the present disclosure.",
                        "To increase cGMP process compliance, the present disclosure demonstrated that cells expanded in stirred tank bioreactors could be harvested and concentrated in a closed and automated manner. To date, only one other report exists of concentrating hPSCs using kSep, concentrating \u02dc1.2\u00d7109 hPSCs tenfold, with 65% recovery of viable cells. In the process described herein, on average, the kSep process retained 94% of all harvested cells, and was able to process a 3 L bioreactor in under 30 minutes, concentrating cells up to 105-fold. Thus, the data herein shows that at least 48\u00d7109 hPSCs can be harvested per kSep 400 cycle (12\u00d7109 cells per chamber\u00d7four chambers), though further experiments would be needed to find the maximum capacity. This maximum capacity will be the main scale up constraint: while the 120 mL/min flow rate could reasonably process a 50 L bioreactor in 125 minutes, the total cells harvested from such a bioreactor (100\u00d7109) could potentially exceed the kSep 400 capacity. This could be overcome by processing two kSep units in parallel, or by harvesting the cells from one unit over two sequential cycles.",
                        "The seamless implementation of a closed, automated concentration step using the kSep400, and subsequent recovery of high-quality hiPSCs, demonstrate the adaptability of the platform according to the present disclosure. The development of a robust, flexible and adaptable process is needed given the continued evolution of cGMP policies and innovations in large-scale manufacturing. Therefore, the MC-based and downstream processing compatible platform discussed herein allow large-scale production of hiPSCs without compromising the quality of expanded hiPSCs.",
                        "Another key element in large-scale manufacturing of cell-based therapies is maintaining the viability of cryopreserved cells such that the therapeutic potential of these cells remains intact. As shown above the cryopreserved hiPSCs produced according to the present disclosure, upon thaw, exhibited confirmed quality and viability.",
                        "In the interest of cost effectiveness and mitigation of risks such as contamination, the present disclosure has demonstrated the ability to directly inoculate cryopreserved cells into 3D. Cryopreserved cells used for the inoculum showed high fold expansion and quality, as was confirmed by cell morphology, expression of hPSC-associated markers and the ability to directly differentiate. Further development of the platform shows feasibility of a 3D seed train such that cells expanded in a 3 L bioreactor, for example, can be re-inoculated in larger bioreactor vessels. Assuming a conservative cell number of 2\u00d7109 cells/L, cells from one 3 L bioreactor could be potentially serve as the inoculum for 3\u00d750 L bioreactors. Assuming an even higher cell yield, achievable by a longer culture period in the bioreactor, one 3 L bioreactor could serve as an inoculum for several 50 L bioreactors or even one 250 L bioreactor. Together, this makes possible an expansion process which is completely 2D-free, closed, automated and requires minimal labor. This will enable commercialization of clinical indications that require large cell numbers, consequently increasing the availability of cell-based therapies.",
