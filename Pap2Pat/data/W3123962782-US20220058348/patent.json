For example, the training samples may be taken from a training dataset according to the data distribution PD and may be in the form of (x, y) pairs, where x usually refers to a single or a pair of sentences, and y refers to the corresponding label.

Updating the NLP classifier in this joint manner may make the NLP classifier aware of P\u03b8(x) and P\u03b8(y|x), instead of focusing solely on P\u03b8(y|x). Such awareness of P\u03b8(x) may improve calibration by allowing the NLP classifier to be more conservative when it detects that an input is out-of-distribution.",

Radford et al, Language models are unsupervised multitask learners (2019), available at https://d4mucfpksyws.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes) was finetuned with samples from the target training set using the standard LM objective. An objective similar to the masked language model (MLM) loss (disclosed in J. Devlin et al, BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, CoRR abs/1810.04805 (2018), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes) was adopted during the finetuning of the noise model. With a given mask ratio M, a part of x was randomly masked, and the model was trained to complete it: LMLM=",

In this way, the noise distribution was made closer to the data distribution. In our experiments we set M=4. During generation, top-k sampling was used (disclosed in A. Fan et al, Hierarchical neural story generation, in Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pgs. 889-898 (2018), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes) with k=20.",
                        "Examples of generated noise samples and masking are shown in Table 1. Note that the masks could be applied to a consecutive span of words (masking is applied to each token independently with probability M).",

Results on STS-B were not included because it is a regression task. To measure calibration error, the expected calibration error (ECE) metric with B (number of bins) set to 20 was used. The ECE is defined as follows. Given an input sample x, for each label y, a model predicts that xbelongs to label y with confidence P\u03b8(x|y). Assuming the test-set contains n samples, there will be n*|Y| predictions. ECE first partitions all predictions into B equally-spaced bins by its confidence. With B=20, the width of each bin is 0.05. For example, the first bin contains all predictions that have confidence in the range of [0, 0.5). Then for each bin ECE computes how the average of confidence is different from its actual accuracy:",

                        "For baseline or NCE training, the recommended hyper-parameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) for Roberta were followed. EBM training was compared with three strong baselines for calibration: posterior calibrated training (PosCal) (disclosed in T. Jung et al, Posterior calibrated training on sentence classification tasks, in Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pgs. 2723-2730 (2020), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, temperature scaling (T-Scal) (disclosed in C. Guo et al, On calibration of modern neural networks, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research vol. 70, pgs. 1321-1330 (2017), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes), and scaling-binning calibrator (Scal-bin) (disclosed in A. Kumar et al, Verified uncertainty calibration, In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32, pgs. 3792-3803 (2019), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. For PosCal and Scal-bin, the published code was used. Scal-bin and T-Scal require a development set for parameter learning and a test set for evaluation, but for each GLUE task only one labeled development set was available. Therefore, half of the standard development set was treated as test set and the other half was treated as development set.",
                        "Table 2 shows comparisons of test-set accuracy and ECE for different methods on the GLUE tasks. For fair comparison between Scal-bin, T-Scal, and EBM training (which does not use the development set), the methods are applied to the whole training set. Performance when applied to the development set is available provided for reference.",
                        "In most tasks, all three EBM variants get significant improvement in ECE with little or no loss in accuracy comparing to the (strong) baseline methods. Moreover, the performance of EBM training is comparable to Scal-bin and T-Scal applied to the development set, while their performance degrades when the development set is not available. Among the three variants, on average, the sharp-hidden variant achieves the best accuracy, while the hidden variant achieves best calibration. The calibration error is shown in FIG. 5.",
                        "FIG. 6 shows how test-set ECE changes during training. It is shown as the training reaches the high-accuracy area, the calibration for baseline model becomes worse, while EBM training is able to reach a better trade-off between accuracy and calibration.",
                        "How does the model get better calibration? FIG. 7 shows the energy value \u00ca\u03b8(x) versus the entropy of the posterior distribution (P\u03b8 (\u22c5|x))=\u03a3y=1|Y|\u2212P\u03b8 (y|x) log P\u03b8 (y|x), for samples in the SST-2 test set. It is shown that models trained with the hidden and sharp-hidden variants tend to assign more conservative predictions (reflected by higher entropy) for higher energy (less likely) samples. This may be due to the strong coupling between the energy function and the classification logits. Concrete examples are provided in Table 3.",
