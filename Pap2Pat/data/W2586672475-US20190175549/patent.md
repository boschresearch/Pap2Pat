# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to compounds for use for increasing, in particular restoring, interferon (IFN) level in an individual.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are numerous situations where increasing or restoring interferon level, especially type I interferon level, can be beneficial for an individual.

This may be the case for a viral infection of course, but also for certain autoimmune diseases such as type-I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, as well as diabetes, allergy or cancer.

Indeed, it has been shown that there was a reduced secretion of IFN-a by blood dendritic cells in human diabetes (Summer et al. (2006) Clinical Immunology, 121:81-89). Besides, recombinant type I interferon (IFN-I), especially IFN-β, is currently used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, in particular relapsing multiple sclerosis (Weinstock-Guttman (2008) Expert Opin Biol Ther 8:1435-1447).

However, its use requires frequent subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, from every other day to every two weeks for the most recent pegylated form of IFN-β (Plegridy®), rendering the treatment difficult to follow for the treated individuals. Besides, as with most treatment with recombinant proteins, individuals often develop an immune response against the administered protein which diminishes the effectivity of the treatment on the long run.

It is thus an aim of the present invention to provide compounds for increasing or restoring IFN level, in particular IFN-I, in an individual overcoming these problems.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention arises from the unexpected finding by the inventors that AMD3100 treatment could restore Type I interferon production by HIV-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells inhibited by other compounds.

Preferably, the CXCR4 receptor according to the invention is a human CXCR4 receptor. CXCR4 is notably represented by SEQ ID NO: 1.

A CXCR4 receptor-binding compound according to the invention can either be known in the art to bind to CXCR4 or it can be determined that it binds to CXCR4. Determining that a compound binds to CXCR4 can be performed by numerous ways known to one of skill in the art. By way of example, CXCR4 binding is assessed by flow cytometry analysis. This procedure is explained in more details in the following Example.

Preferably, the CXCR4 receptor-binding compound according to the invention comprises from 1 to 45 carbon atoms and at least one amine group positively charged at a pH from 6 to 8, in particular at a pH from 7.0 to 7.8, more particularly at a physiological blood pH of a human individual.

## EXAMPLE

### A. Materials and Methods

**1. Blood Samples, Isolation and Culture of Blood Leukocytes.**

Blood was obtained from healthy HIV-1-seronegative blood bank donors. Experimental procedures with human blood were done according to the European Union guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. In vitro experiments were performed using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated by density centrifugation from peripheral blood leukocyte separation medium (Cambrex, Gaithersburg, Md.). pDC were purified by negative selection with the Human plasmacytoid DC enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, Md.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). After purification, the purity obtained was higher than 91% for pDC.

**2. Viral Stimulation and Infection.**

PBMC were seeded at 1.106/1 mL or purified pDC were seeded at 5.104/100 μl and then stimulated with the following viruses: inactivated AT-2 HIV-1MN (CXCR4 co-receptor specific) or AT-2 HIV-1ADA (CCR5 co-receptor specific) at 60 ng/mL p24CA equivalent (provided by J.D. Lifson (SAIC-NCI, Frederick, Md.)), Infectious human Influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (Flu), titer 1:8192 at dilution 1:1000 or DENV-2 16681 at MOI 10. Infectious HIV-1MN [tissue culture 50% infective dose (TCID50)=106] and HIV-1ADA (TCID50=1,000) were used at the same concentration. Purified pDC were pre-treated with amino compounds for 1 hour, following overnight stimulation with virus. Supernatants were collected for cytokine detection. Microvesicles isolated from uninfected cell cultures matched to the culture to produce the virus were used as negative control (Mock).

**3. Chemical Compounds.**

Histamine dihydrochloride and clobenpropit dihydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, Mo., USA) were diluted in pure water. The compounds were added in pDC cultures at 10 μM (or other if specified) 1 hour before stimulation or not of the different viruses. For histamine, X-vivo culture media (Lonza) was used in order to avoid histaminases. Cells were pre-incubated 1 hour with AMD3100 (20 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mo., USA) prior to CB or histamine incubation. pDC were cultured in the presence of 5 mM of the oligodinucleotide A151 (TTAGGG) ODN (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa).

**4. Cytokine Detection.**

pDC's supernatants were tested for multispecies soluble IFN-a by ELISA (PBL Assay Science, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

**5. RT-qPCR Analysis.**

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kit and was submitted to DNase treatment (Qiagen), following manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and purity were evaluated by spectrophotometry (Biophotometer, Eppendorf). Five hundred ng of RNA were reverse-transcribed using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time, Takara) in a 10 μl reaction. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in duplicates using Takyon ROX SYBR MasterMix blue dTTP (Eurogentec) on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Transcripts were quantified using the following program: 3 min at 95° C. followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95° C., 20 s at 60° C. and 20 s at 72° C. Values for each transcript were normalized to expression levels of RPL13A (60S ribosomal protein L13a) using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Primers used for quantification of transcripts by real time quantitative PCR are indicated below:

6. Molecular Modelling of CXCR4 with Various Ligands.

The molecular docking program cDOCKER was used for automated molecular docking simulations and various scoring function were used to rank poses: Jain, cDocker Interaction optimized, Ludi. PDB files were cleaned using the prepare protein protocol of Discovery Studio 4.1, membrane was added according to Im. W algorithm Ligands and their conformer were prepared using prepare ligand protocol after conformation generation. Complexes were selected on the basis of criteria of interacting energy combined with geometrical matching quality as well as compromise of scoring function Figures were generated with Discovery studio 4.1 graphics system. The 2D representations of molecular structures interaction of Discovery Studio was used for delineation of the detailed interactions between ligands and CXCR4 (PDB code: 3ODU). An interaction was considered a hydrophobic interaction if the Van der Walls fraction was 0.7 and was considered a hydrogen bond if it was between a listed donor and acceptor and the angles and distances formed by the atoms surrounding the hydrogen bond lay within the default criteria. RMSD were calculated using Discovery studio 4.1 and with ITlt in CXCR4/ITlt co-crystal as reference (PDB code 3ODU).

**7. Statistical Analysis.**

P values (P) were determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. *=P<0.05; **=P<0.01 and ***=P<0.001. Univariate distributions of flow cytometry data were performed by probability binning, in 300 bins using FlowJo software.

Data sets were analysed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests (cytokine concentration time courses). GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) was used for data analysis and preparation of all graphs. P-values less than 0.01 were considered to be statistically significant.

## RESULTS

### 1. AMD3100 Prevents Type I Interferon Production Inhibition Induced by Amines

1.1. AMD3100 was tested for inhibition of type I interferon production by HIV-stimulated pDC. AMD3100 alone did not block type I IFN nor TRAIL expression by HIV-activated pDC.

1.2. AMD3100 was then tested for its ability to block the action of amine-type compounds, i.e. histamine and clobenpropit (CB), which bind at the ITlt pocket on CXCR4 (ITlt is a CXCR4 antagonist) and notably inhibit the production of IFN-I by HIV-stimulated pDC.

The expressions of TRAIL, IFN-a and IFN-β in pDC treated or not with AMD3100 were thus quantified.

Purified cells were pre-incubated with AMD3100 for 1 hour and then by histamine or CB for 1 hour and finally exposed to HIV-1 overnight.

AMD3100 drastically abolished biological activities of histamine and CB on HIV activated-pDC. Indeed, the inventors observed that AMD3100 treatment could restore IFN-a, IFN-β and TRAIL mRNA expression (FIG. 1) and IFN-a production (FIG. 2) inhibited by histamine or CB in HIV-activated pDC. These results were confirmed for the expression of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) mRNA expression in HIV-activated pDC (FIGS. 3A-3C).

### 2. Identification of a Binding Pocket for AMD3100 on CXCR4 Extracellular Domain

To understand the molecular interaction between AMD3100 and CXCR4, in silico docking experiments were performed.

ITlt, a CXCR4 antagonist, was used as an internal control to validate the molecular modelling protocol. ITlt and AMD3100 were thus docked in the ITlt binding pocket of CXCR4.

It has been first confirmed that ITlt was replaced properly compared to the crystal structure. Indeed, RMSDs of ITlt heavy atoms resolved in crystal structure (PDB code 3ODU) and ITlt docking poses after scoring are around 1 Å (equivalent to the variation observed when comparing ITlt in 3ODU co-crystal with other co-crystallized structures (PDB codes 3OE6-3OE8-3OE9)) (Table 1).

The 2D representation was used for delineation of the detailed interactions between ligands and CXCR4 (Table 2).

The molecular docking of AMD3100 and CXCR4/ITlt co-crystallization allowed the identification of two distinct binding pockets on CXCR4; AMD3100 pocket covers up superficially the two subpockets of CXCR4 while the ITlt pockets is located more deeply in the minor subpocket of CXCR4. Thus, the access of ITlt or amine-type compounds, such as histamine or CB, to the binding pocket could be blocked by AMD3100.
