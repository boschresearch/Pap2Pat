                        "Inflammation is fundamentally a protective response of the body triggered by physical, chemical and biological stimuli that can cause pain, swelling, and in some cases, lead to dysfunction of the organ or tissue (see EP1485127).",
                        "The inflammatory process can be divided into two phases: chronic and acute. The acute inflammatory response is an immediate and nonspecific response against the aggresive agent. The response is always qualitatively the same, regardless the stimulus. Chronic inflammation is always preceded by acute inflammation and is not observed at this stage, the characteristic signs of acute reactions (pain, tumor, warmth, redness and loss of function). It is characterized by an increase in the grade of cellularity and other tissue elements, given the permanence of the offending agent. Chronic inflammation can be subdivided into: nonspecific, productive (or hyperplasic), exudative and granulomatous. In general it is characterized by the presence of mononuclear macrophage system (lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells), tissue destruction caused by the presence of the offending agent and attempts at repair.",
                        "The use of medicinal substances to treat pain and fever has been reported since ancient civilizations that used plants with analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential. Literature reports point to the use of willow as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic prescribed by Hippocrates in the year 400 BC (Blobaum, A. L.; Marnett, L. J. Structural and functional basis of cyclooxygenase inhibition. J. Med. Chem. 50(7), p. 1425-1441, 2007).",
                        "Currently, treatment for pain, inflammation and fever is carried out with anti-inflammatory drugs. These are among the most widely used of all therapeutic agents. The most widely used class of compounds is that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It is estimated that there are more than 50 different NSAIDs on the market, but none is ideal in controlling or modifying the signs and symptoms of inflammation, particularly those that occur in common inflammatory joint disease (Rang, H. P.; Dale M. M.; Ritter, J. M. Pharmacology. 4 ed. Rio de Janeiro: Editora Guanabara Koogan. Cap. 13, p. 189, 2001).",
                        "The action mechanism of NSAIDs was first deciphered by Vane, who observed a decrease in the concentration of prostaglandins in lung tissue treated with salicylates (Vane, J. R. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of action for aspirin-like drugs. Nature (London) New Biol. 231, p. 232-235, 1971).",
                        "From Vane's studies, it was proposed that the mechanism of action of NSAIDs would be related to the inhibition of prostaglandin formation due to the ability of these compounds to inhibit enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins in the physiological and inflammatory process (Howard, P.; Delafontaine, P. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Cardiovascular Risk. Journal of the American College of Cardiology Vol. 43, No. 4, 2004).",
                        "In 1991, it was discovered the existence of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) with different expression profiles, but with a 60% homology among the aminoacid sequences (Kujubu, D. A.; Fletcher, B. S.; Varnum, B. C.; Lim, R. W.; Herschman, H. R. TIS10, a phorbol ester tumor promoter-inducible mRNA from Swiss 3T3 cells, encodes a novel prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase homologue J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12866-12872, 1991).",
                        "COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme involved in several physiological processes in the body, such as for instance, mucus production responsible for protecting the gastric lining in the stomach acid environment. COX-2 can be induced in response to agents such as cytokines, mitogens, endotoxins of the inflammatory process (Sapirstein A., Saito H., Texel S. J., Samad T. A., O'Leary E., Bonventre J. V. Cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha regulates induction of brain cyclooxygenase-2 in a mouse model of inflammation. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 288 (6): p. 1774-82, 2005). Initially, one would imagine that as induced isoform, COX-2 would be an important target for selected NSAIDs that would not interfere in the normal physiological process. Thus, we developed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selective inhibitors of COX-2 isoform, such as for instance, celecoxib that did not show the ability to cause gastric damage as the 1st generation of NSAIDs.",
                        "However, afterwards, it was discovered that COX-2 plays an important physiological role in the brain, kidneys and cardiovascular system.",
                        "In the circulatory system, for example, the balance between pro- and anticoagulant activity is affected by the use of COX-2 selective drugs such as rofecoxib, for example. Thus the inhibition of COX-2 increases the risk of thrombus formation and deleterious cardiovascular events. This fact prompted the withdrawal of rofecoxib by Merck in September 2004 (Nartey, J L, Reichenbach, S., Sterchi R., Dieppe, P., Egger, M. Risk of cardiovascular events and rofecoxib: cumulative meta-analysis. The Lancet, Volume 364, Issue 9450, Pages 2021-2029, 2004; Howard & Delafontaine, 2004).",
                        "In the brain, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis has been reported as beneficial for the treatment of various diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. It is said that NSAIDs have a neuroprotective action reducing the incidence and risk of Alzheimer's disease and significantly slows the disease progression (Colin K. Combs, Derrick E. Johnson, J. Colleen Karlo, Steven B. Cannady, and Gary E. Landreth Inflammatory Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease: Inhibition of \u03b2-Amyloidal-Stimulated proinflammatory Responses and Neurotoxicity by PPAR9 agonists.

How chronic inflammation can affect the brain and support the development of Alzheimer's disease in old age: the role of microglia and astrocytes. Aging Cell. p. 169-176, 2004).",
                        "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis being treated with NSAIDs had significantly reduced risks of presenting Alzheimer's disease (McGeer P L, McGeer E G Anti-inflammatory drugs in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Ann NY Acad Sci 777:213-220, 1996; Stewart W F, Kawas C., Corrada M., Metter, E J Risk of Alzheimer's disease and duration of NSAID use. Neurology 48:626-632, 1997).",
                        "The 1st generation NSAIDs like diclofenac, ibuprofen, salicylic acetyl acid and naproxen inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. This non-selectivity makes these types of NSAIDs inhibit as well important prostaglandins of the physiological process responsible for instance, for gastric protection. That's why, every so often, the NSAIDs cause gastropathies such as ulcers and bleeding (Steen, K S S; Nurmohamed, M T; Visman, I.; Heijerman, M.; Boers, M.; Dijkmans, B A C; Lems, W F Decreasing incidence of symptomatic gastrointestinal ulcers and ulcer complications in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Ann Rheum Dis. 67:256-259, 2008). Furthermore, some chronic inflammatory illnesses as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, Chron's disease and osteoarthritis demand daily administration of NSAIDs, which increases even more the probability of ulcer formation. Several studies have shown an increased risk of developing ulcers due to NSAID use (Ong, C K S; Lirk, P., Tan, C H, Seymour, R A An Evidence-Based Update on Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Clinical Medicine & Research. 5 (1), p. 19-34, 2007; Babush, J. G.; Tripp, M. L.; Howell, T.; Bland, J. S.; Darlan, G.; Lerman, R.; Lukaczer, D. O.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and life threatening Complications of peptic ulceration. Gut. 28(5): 527-532, 1987).",
                        "Besides gastric ulceration, other adverse effects have been related to the use of NSAIDs, among them: skin lesions, acute renal failure, chronic nephritis, renal papillary necrosis, liver disorders, bone marrow disorders (Ong, C. K. S.; Lirk, P.; Tan, C. H.; Seymour, R. A. An Evidence-Based Update on Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Clinical Medicine & Research. 5 (1), p. 19-34, 2007).",
                        "Currently, other targets of the inflammatory process have been explored and the control of the inflammatory process by inhibiting distinct pathways acts synergistically in controlling inflammation. During the inflammatory process we have the participation of various substances including: prostaglandins, cytokines, histamine, serotonin and others. Among the pro-inflammatory cytokines we can highlight: YL-1\u03b2, YL-6, YL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (Kraychete, D. C.; Calasans, M. T. A.; Valente, C. M. L. Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and Pain. Rev Bras Reumatol, v. 46, n. 3, p. 199-206, 2006).",
                        "TNF-\u03b1 is produced by many cell types including monocytes and macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, neutrophyls, tumor cells and fibroblasts. TNF-\u03b1 is the key regulator of other proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1-\u03b2 (YL-1\u03b2, YL-6 and YL-8). In physiological conditions, low grades of TNF-\u03b1 confer protection against infectious agents, tumor and tissue damage. However, overproduction of these cytokines can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and immunopathological diseases (Alexandre-Moreira, M. S.; Takiyac, C. M.; Arrudad, L. B.; Pascarellic, B.; Gomese, R. N.; Neto, H. C. C. F.; Lima, L. M.; Barreiro, E. J.

International Immunopharmacology. 5, p. 485-494, 2005).",
                        "TNF-\u03b1 exerts proinflammatory effects by increasing chemotactic properties, the adhesion of neutrophyls to the endothelium due to increased molecules adhesion, stimulating the production of free radicals and the synthesis of other inflammatory mediators such as YL-1 and PGE2. TNF-\u03b1 also induces changes in coagulant and anticoagulant properties and increases the liver synthesis of a few acute phase reagents. Moreover, it is an important mediator of sepsis syndrome and endotoxic shock, being able to suppress the biosynthesis of lipoprotein lipase and lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue, damaging lipid storage in adipocytes.",
                        "The ability of the TNF-\u03b1 to change the anticoagulant properties of vascular endothelium and induce procoagulant activity on endothelial cell surface, stimulating the production of platelet activating factor (PAF), and increasing leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, results in the increase of the resistance to blood flow, making it more difficult for the circulation and, therefore, exacerbating microvascular stasis.",
                        "Several substances have been reported as having a direct effect on the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1. Among them are converting enzyme inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), neutralizing antibodies (infliximab), and drugs structurally related to thalidomide (Klotz, U.; Teml, A.; Schwab, M. Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Use of Infliximab. Olin Pharmacokinet 2007; 46 (8): 645-660; Lima, L. M.; Fraga, C. A. M.; Barreiro, E. J. The rebirth of a drug: thalidomide. Quim. Nova. v.24. n. 5, p. 683-688, 2001). Thalidomide, with its phthalmide structure has been described for the first time in document GB768821.",
                        "It has also been reported that arthritic patients treated with monoclonal antibodies anti-TNF-\u03b1 (infliximabe) presented a decrease of the pain associated with the disease (Rankin, E. C., Choy, E. H., Kassimos, D., Kingsley, G. H., Sopwith, A. M., Insenberg, D. A., Panayi, G. S. The therapeutic effects of an engineered human anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody_CDP571 in rheumathoid arthritis. Br. J. Rheumatol. 34, 334-342, 1995). This fact demonstrates that the TNF-\u03b1 has an important role in peripheral hiperalgesia, and its inhibition has been associated to the reduction of acute and chronic pain, what explains the analgesic effect of the thalidomide one, first drug anti-TNF\u03b1 introduced in treatment (Ribeiro, R. A.; Vale, M. L.; Ferriera, S. H.; Cunha, F. Q. Analgesic effect of thalidomide on inflammatory pain. Eur. J. Pharmacol., v. 391, p. 97-103, 2000).",
                        "Several laboratories and research groups have reported the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide, demonstrating its therapeutic potential against the treatment of pathologies such as multiple myeloma, cachexia, tuberculosis, arthritis, sickle cell anemia among others (Miyachi, H.; Ogasawara, A.; Azuma, A.; Hashimoto, Y.).

                        "The development of new thalidomide analogues containing the key pharmacophore for inhibiting activity of TNF, and devoid of toxicophore groups responsible for teratogenicity is the ultimate goal for the development of new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of pathologies associated with or exacerbated by increased plasma grades of TNF.",
                        "It has also been reported that patients with chronic inflammatory diseases have high grades of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1.

                        "Among the strategies used to introduce a new drug in the therapy, the molecular modification has shown promising. This helps in the discovery of new drugs with more adequate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile than the original prototype. Among the techniques of molecular modification the following can be cited: latentiation, bioisosterism, hybridization, homology, annelation among other (Wermuth, C. G.

The new compounds described are obtained by molecular hybridization strategy between the phthalmidic subunit of thalidomide (held responsible for the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1) and NSAIDs. Through this strategy, it is possible to act synergistically in chronic inflammatory diseases on two fronts: a front by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, and other front inhibiting alpha tumor necrosis factor, responsible for amplification of the inflammatory response. Thus, new compounds of the invention present therapeutic advantages in that they act on different targets in the same disease and constitute a new therapeutic approach for treating chronic inflammatory diseases."

                        "This invention aims at providing a differentiated alternative for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. More specifically, the new NSAID's phthalimide derivatives act on such diseases potentiating the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity by acting on different targets: inhibition of cyclooxygenase (responsible for the production of prostaglandins) and inhibition/modulation of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). The inhibition and/or modulation of these different targets synergistically assist in controlling the inflammatory process and constitute a new approach for the treatment of various diseases such as, for instance, rheumatoid arthritis and Chron's disease.",
                        "The invention is aimed at minimizing the major limitations and complications associated with drug therapy, especially that based on NSAIDs, that is, provide an alternative to reduce side and adverse effects and of compounds usually used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory processes through the use of compounds of the invention, such as inhibitors and/or modulators of TNF-\u03b1 and enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), improving the patient's life quality. Thus, one of the main adverse effects of the anti-inflammatory drugs of first generation, which is the gastroculceration, can be markedly decreased, justifying their use in the treatment of chronic pain/inflammation. In addition, due to the higher lipophilicity of new derivatives, they can act as anti-inflammatory in the central nervous system, aiding in the treatment of some diseases such as, for example, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.",

                                "In FIG. 7 we selected the stomach of the animals treated with diclofenac and celecoxib, respectively. Celecoxib was intended as a selective inhibitor of isoform COX-2 present in high concentrations of the inflammatory process. COX-2 converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which among the various actions can cause sensitivity of the nociceptive terminals, vasodilatation and extravasation of inflammatory exudate, leading to edema and pain. Through FIG. 7, it can be seen that even the COX-2 selective NSAID has the potential to cause gastric ulceration, which according to the classification reported in the literature can be classified as grade 2. The NSAIDs that are not selective, such as for instance, diclofenac, present maximum ulcerogenic potential and, thus, are classified as grade 5. Although the non-selective NSAIDs, in a general way, can be potentially ulcerogenic, the degree of ulceration varies from one anti-inflammatory agent to another. Thus, it is observed that the NSAID, such as for example, the salicylic acid (grade 5) is a lot more ulcerogenic than diclofenac (also grade 5). That which differs one from the other is the size of the lesions observed in different NSAIDs.",
