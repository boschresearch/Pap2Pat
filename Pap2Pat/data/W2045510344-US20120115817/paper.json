    "date": "2009-08-26",
    "abstract": "The compound 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one (1), planned as a pro-drug of diclofenac (2), was easily synthesized in 94% yield by an intramolecular reaction in the presence of coupling agent (i.e., EDC). Compound 1 showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity without gastro-ulcerogenic effects. The chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis profile of the lactam derivative 1 does not indicate conversion to diclofenac (2). This compound is a new non-ulcerogenic prototype for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.",

                "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of inflammation, pain and arthritis. The beneficial effect is associated with inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX) that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins in inflammatory processes [1]. The major limitation of long-term therapeutic use of NSAIDs (COX-1 inhibitors) is their gastrotoxicity. This side effect produced by NSAIDs are believed to involved two different mechanism: inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the stomach, responsible for inducing mucus production and a local action exerted by direct contact of the drugs with the gastric mucosa due the acidic nature of the NSAIDs [2].",
                "The use of latentiation as a molecular modification strategy provides NSAID produgs with improved safety profiles [3,4]. The prodrug approach afforded compounds with better anti-inflammatory activity, differentiated pharmacokinetic profiles and reduced gastric ulcerogenic activity [5,6,7,8,9]. Using the prodrug approach, one strategy that could be useful is to temporarily mask the carboxylic acid function of the NSAIDs so the prodrug hydrolyzes in vivo to release the active parent NSAID [10,11,12].",
                "In this context, we have conceived a new indolinonic compound 1 that after hydrolysis could regenerate the parent drug diclofenac (2) (Scheme 1). The carboxylic acid function of diclofenac was thus masked and the new molecule 1 was expected to have anti-inflammatory activity with less gastro-ulcerogenic effect. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities were evaluated using classical models. In addition, we have studied the in vitro and ex vivo hydrolysis profile of the compound 1."

After, the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with distilled water. The solvent removed by evaporation resulting in a 94% yield of 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one (1). The purity of synthesized compound was checked by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and elemental analyses. The structure was characterized by nuclear resonance magnetic (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectrometry. The elemental analysis results were within \u00b10.4% of the theoretical values. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed the methylene protons at \u03b4 3.87 (s, 2H), while the aromatic protons appeared at \u03b4 6.38-7.74.

                        "The chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis of the synthesized lactam was carried out in aqueous buffer solutions (pH 1.2 and 7.4) and in human serum (80%), respectively. A HPLC (UV-Vis detector) method, specific for the estimation of the released parent drug diclofenac (2) and lactam derivative 1 was developed.",
                        "In pH 1.2 buffer the lactam derivative was found intact after 8 h, with no observable hydrolysis. Based on these observations, it was concluded that the stomach would not be exposed to the free carboxylic group of the NSAID (diclofenac) since the lactam would not be cleaved in the stomach (Figure 1).",
                        "In pH 7.4 buffer the lactam derivative did not observably hydrolyze after 48 h. The compound could thus be absorbed in its intact form without biotransformation to diclofenac in the intestine. Furthermore, these data indicate that the lactam is stable in plasmatic pH after absorption for at least 48 h. It was concluded from these observations that these derivatives survived the GI pH conditions successfully.",
                        "The plasma hydrolysis study was carried out to evaluate the influence of enzymatic hydrolysis in plasma during 24 h. Enzymes such as amidases have been shown to hydrolyze lactam rings. However, no hydrolysis was observed in plasma (pH 7.4; 37 \u00b0C), indicating that the lactam derivative did not undergo enzymatic biotransformation in plasma (Figure 2).",
                        "The absence of lactam hydrolysis could be due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. Hydrolyses of amides and lactams are slower when compared to ester or lactone hydrolyses because the oxygen atom attached to the carbonyl (in esters and lactones) is more electron withdrawing that the nitrogen atom in amides. So the ester carbonyl group becomes more deficient electronically and suffers more easily nucleophilic attacks in hydrolysis reactions than the respective amides. This could explain, electronically, the greater stability of amides and lactams. On the other hand, structurally the carbonyl of this lactam is more sterically blocked, decreasing the chemical hydrolyses of the substrate 1. The presence of two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic ring blocks the access of nucleophiles to the carbonyl of the lactam to hydrolysis reactions (Figure 3).",
                        "This factors confers stability and could explain why the compound 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2-one (1) remains unaffected by chemical hydrolysis in the various pH conditions of biological fluids."

After 3 hours, the anti-inflammatory activity of lactam 1 was statistically significant when compared with the carrageenan group. After 4 hours, the anti-inflammatory activity of both compounds is significant. It has been noted that the anti-inflammatory activity of lactam 1 and diclofenac (2) is comparable. All results were statistically significant when compared to aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (0.5% w/v) used as control (not shown).",
                        "The anti-nociceptive activities of diclofenac (2) and its lactam derivative 1 were measured by their ability to inhibit acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. The vehicle control was considered to exhibit 100% writhing, and the protection afforded by the parent drug and its derivative was calculated on a percentage basis. The percentage of protection was calculated using Equation (1): Protection (%) = 100 \u2013 [number of writhings in test / number of writhings in control \u00d7 100] (1)",
                        "According to Table 1, the lactam 1 possesses analgesic protection equivalent to 48.1% of control values, which was less than diclofenac (65.2%) in the model used. These results point to the fact that lactam 1 seems to be more effective as an anti-inflammatory than as an analgesic compound when compared to the parent drug (diclofenac).",
                        "The ulcerogenicity assay was performed using rats administered 100 \u03bcmol/kg\u20131 of each drug. It was possible to observe a smaller number of ulcers in animals treated with lactam 1, compared to the animals treated with diclofenac (Table 2).",
                        "Celecoxib was used as a COX-2 inhibitor at the same concentration. Animals treated with diclofenac developed an average of 69 ulcerogenic lesions with only one administration and around 6.7% of the lesions were considered to be large (higher than 2 mm in diameter). This allowed to the classification of lesions, which was scored depending on the severity of mucosal damage. Celecoxib administration, at the above concentration, led to the development of around six lesions \u201350% of which were puntiform (lesions <1mm) and 50% of small lesions (1.0-2.0 mm). Celecoxib was classified in this assay as scoring a 2 for lesion development. The lactam derivative did not cause any mucosal damage and was classified with a score of 0 (Figure 5). The results were obtained with an average of six animals analyzed per group. These findings suggest that masking of the carboxylic function of the diclofenac successfully decreased gastro-ulcerogenicity."
