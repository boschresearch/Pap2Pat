    "title": "The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling gene AtCHR12 mediates temporary growth arrest in Arabidopsis thaliana upon perceiving environmental stress",
    "date": "2007-07-02",
    "abstract": "One of the earliest responses of plants to environmental stress is establishing a temporary growth arrest that allows adaptation to adverse conditions. The response to abiotic stress requires the modulation of gene expression, which may be mediated by the alteration of chromatin structures. This alteration can be accomplished with the help of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, such as the various SWI/SNF classes of ATPases. Here, we investigate the role of the Arabidopsis SNF2/Brahma-type AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene in plant growth and development in reaction to adverse environmental conditions. We show that the AtCHR12 chromatin-remodeling gene plays a vital role in mediating the temporary growth arrest of Arabidopsis that is induced upon perception of stress. Exposing an AtCHR12 overexpressing mutant to stress conditions leads to growth arrest of normally active primary buds, as well as to reduced growth of the primary stem. In contrast, the AtCHR12 knockout mutant shows less growth arrest than the wild-type when exposed to moderate stress. Without stress, mutant plants are indistinguishable from the wild-type, and the growth arrest response seems to depend on the severity of the stress applied. Modulation of AtCHR12 expression correlates with changes in expression of dormancy-associated genes. This is in agreement with the concept of AtCHR12 participation in priming the plants for the growth arrest response. Our data indicate that AtCHR12-associated growth arrest differs from DELLA-mediated growth restraint. This establishes AtCHR12 as a novel gene involved in the response repertoire of plants that permits flexible modulation of growth in adverse and/or otherwise limiting environments.",

                "Various environmental stresses cause adverse effects on the growth of plants. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants adapt using a wide range of responses at the molecular, cellular and whole-plant level (Zhu et al., 1997). Several proteins are synthesized in plants in response to stress. These include proteins that take part in signal transduction, transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins and various proteins that counteract unfavourable conditions (Smallwood et al., 1999). However, one of the general responses of plants to potentially adverse environmental conditions is a partial or complete arrest of growth. Inhibited or reduced growth is considered to be an adaptive feature for survival, allowing plants to employ multiple resources to combat stress (Xiong and Zhu, 2001). Generally, growth resumes immediately after the environmental limitations are overcome (Rohde et al., 1999).",
                "The expression of numerous genes has to be modulated to achieve an appropriate response of plants to changes in environmental conditions (Arnholdt-Schmitt, 2004). These changes in expression patterns are thought to require the alteration of chromatin structures at promoters and other regulatory DNA regions with the help of chromatin-remodeling enzymes (Aalfs and Kingston, 2000). Such enzymes modulate the chromatin state into either an 'open' (activation of transcription) or 'closed' (repression of transcription) configuration (Harikrishnan et al., 2005). The importance of chromatin remodeling in the transcriptional response to stress has been reported in yeast (Damelin et al., 2002) and mammalian cells (de La Serna et al., 2000). In plants, chromatin-remodeling proteins have been demonstrated to take part in the regulation of flowering time and vernalization (Gendall et al., 2001;Noh and Amasino, 2003). Recently, chromatin-remodeling proteins were implicated in both acclimatization and adaptation in response to UV-B in maize (Casati et al., 2006).",
                "Prominent remodelers of chromatin are the ATPasedependent remodeling complexes. These large multi-subunit complexes use ATP hydrolysis to locally disrupt or alter the topology of DNA (Tsukiyama, 2002). In mammalian cells, the protein composition of such remodeling complexes can be very dynamic (Olave et al., 2002). They consist of a heterogeneous mix of protein subunits that are assembled combinatorially. The proteins within such complexes can interact with the basal transcriptional machinery and/or with gene-specific DNA-binding factors (Peterson and Workman, 2000). This way, remodeling complexes play important roles in the regulation of expression of eukaryotic genes, notably in development (Vignali et al., 2000). Currently, four different classes of ATPase-dependent remodeling complexes are recognized on the basis of the type of ATPase subunit. These classes are known as SWI/SNF, ISWI, Mi-2 and Ino80 (Mohrmann and Verrijzer, 2005). The yeast SWI/SNF family was the first chromatin-remodeling complex investigated (Sudarsanam and Winston, 2000). Its active components are highly conserved from yeast to human. SWI/SNF-based complexes include the yeast SWI2/SNF2 and the related RSC complex, the Drosophila Brahma complex, and the human BRM and BRG1 complexes (Martens and Winston, 2003). They all contain an ATPase subunit homologous to yeast SWI2 ATPase. The human remodeling complexes contain two ATPase subunits, hBRM and hBRG1, while Drosophila contains only a single ATPase, Brahma (BRM).",
                "The Arabidopsis genome contains no less than 42 loci encoding putative SNF2-like ATPase subunits (http:// www.chromdb.org). So far, the function of 10 of these loci has been characterized: all operate as modifiers of transcriptional or epigenetic regulation in plant development (Wagner, 2003). The subfamily closest to the SNF2/Brahmatype ATPase consists of four loci: AtBRM, SYD, AtCHR23 and AtCHR12 (Verbsky and Richards, 2001). The first two have been characterized in more detail. AtBRM is closest to Drosophila Brahma (Farrona et al., 2004). Silencing AtBRM demonstrated that this gene is required for proper vegetative and reproductive development. AtBRM is strongly expressed in meristems, young organs and tissues with rapidly dividing cells. A loss-of-function mutation in SYD was identified in a screen for enhancers of a weak leafy (LFY) allele. The syd mutant displayed a pleiotropic phenotype, including short stature, slow growth, leaf polarity defects, ovule growth arrest and loss of maintenance of the shoot apical meristem. SYD was shown to function as a LFYdependent repressor of the meristem identity switch in floral transition, most notably in the non-inductive photoperiod (Wagner and Meyerowitz, 2002). WUSCHEL (WUS) was identified as the first direct target of the SYD in the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis (Kwon et al., 2005).",
                "Here, we present a detailed molecular genetic study of the role of the Arabidopsis thaliana AtCHR12 chromatinremodeling gene in growth arrest upon the perception of environmental stress. By comparing overexpression and loss-of-function mutants with the corresponding wild-type, we show that this plant SNF2/Brahma-type chromatinremodeling gene is involved in temporary growth arrest in response to adverse environmental stimuli. Such growth arrest is hypothesized to help plants to cope with adverse conditions (Achard et al., 2006;Zhu, 2001). Our data provide strong novel evidence that, through the action of this gene, chromatin remodeling plays an important role in mediating the growth response of plants in unfavourable environmental conditions."

                        "An activation-tagged mutant of AtCHR12 was identified in a population of activation-tagged lines in accession Wassilijevskaja (Ws) carrying the En-I maize transposon system with four tandem copies of the 35S enhancer sequence (Marsch-Martinez et al., 2002). In this line, the enhancer sequence was integrated about 1 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of AtCHR12 (At3 g06010; Figure 1a). The integration site was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Overexpression of AtCHR12 in this line was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, showing a considerable upregulation of expression in leaves, flowers, roots (Figure 1b) and seedlings (Figure 1c). In addition, overexpression of AtCHR12 was analyzed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Figure 1c) generated by introducing the AtCHR12 gene under the control of the potato Lhca3.St.1 promoter, which in the light behaves as semi-constitutive promoter (Nap et al., 1993). To compare the phenotype due to the overexpressed allele with that of a loss-of-function allele of the same gene, the SALK T-DNA line (SALK_105458) in the Columbia (Col) background that has a T-DNA insertion in the first exon of AtCHR12 was analyzed. In this line, expression of the AtCHR12 gene was not detected by RT-PCR (Figure 1c) even at a considerably increased number of cycles (40 instead of 35), under which conditions a PCR product is detectable in wild-type (data not shown).",
                        "In this paper, the activation-tagged overexpressed allele of AtCHR12 is designated as AtCHR12ov, overexpressed transgenic alleles are designated as AtCHR12_tov, and the knockout allele is designated as atchr12.",
                        "Under standard conditions, AtCHR12 overexpressing lines resemble the wild-type",
                        "The phenotype of AtCHR12ov was studied in homozygous plants of the F 3 generation under standard growth conditions. Three weeks after germination, mutant plants were indistinguishable from wild-type (Ws; Figure 1d). Neither the inflorescence emergence nor the initiation of axillary branches appeared to be affected. However, after the primary inflorescence stem had reached a length of 6-8 cm, growth arrest of the primary inflorescence was observed in 10-20% of the AtCHR12ov plants. The primary inflorescence, usually carrying a few open flowers or developing siliques, stopped growing (Figure 1e-g). In approximately half of the plants with this phenotype, the primary inflorescence never resumed growth and remained arrested for the rest of the life of the plant (Figure 1f). Because the growth of axillary shoots was not affected, the main shoot became overgrown (Figure 1g). In other plants with the growth-arrested phenotype, growth of the primary inflorescence re-initiated after 1-2 weeks, resulting in numerous new flowers. None of the wild-type plants showed such growth arrest of the primary inflorescence. Therefore, under optimal growth conditions, growth of the majority of the plants is not affected by overexpression of AtCHR12, and arrest of the primary inflorescence is a subtle phenotype. AtCHR12ov plants were fertile and did not show any other obvious morphological or developmental differences from the corresponding wildtype (Ws; data not shown). Transgenic AtCHR12_tov lines did not differ from wild-type plants. Also, the loss-of-function line atchr12 did not show any phenotypic difference when compared with the corresponding wild-type (Col; data not shown) grown under standard conditions.",
                        "AtCHR12 is involved in the response to environmental stress Growth of plants can be arrested by various abiotic stresses (Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2000). Therefore, we challenged both overexpressing and loss-of-function mutants of AtCHR12 and their corresponding wild-types with three environmental stresses: drought, heat and salinity.",
                        "The effect of drought was analyzed by growing plants first for 3 or 4 weeks under standard controlled conditions when water was supplied every day, followed by a period up to 7-10 days of withholding water supply. During this period, most of the overexpressing plants showed significantly reduced growth of the primary stem (Figure 2a). The length of their stem was 55-80% of that of the wild-type (Ws). No such significant difference was observed between wild-type Ws plants and overexpressing mutants without water stress (Figure 2b). Upon re-watering, most plants of both the AtCHR12ov and AtCHR12_tov lines resumed normal growth and continued to grow for the same period of time as they would have done without the arrest. As a result, they reached the same stem height as wild-type (Ws) plants, but with delay (data not shown). Moreover, when exposed to water shortage, the primary inflorescence of wild-type (Ws) plants exhibited only moderately delayed growth compared to non-treated Ws plants. In contrast, growth arrest of the primary inflorescence was observed in 70-80% of the drought-stressed AtCHR12ov plants, compared to only 10-20% in the population of non-treated AtCHR12ov plants.",
                        "The same phenotype was observed in AtCHR12_tov lines, which showed growth arrest of the primary inflorescence of variable strength (data not shown), probably reflecting different levels of transgene expression (Mlynarova et al., 1994). In contrast, the atchr12 knockout plants showed significantly better growth of the primary stem when water was withheld, compared to the corresponding wild-type (Col) plants (Figure 2a). The primary inflorescence of atchr12 did not show any visible differences from wild-type (Col) plants.",
                        "Heat is another environmental factor that negatively affects plant growth (Warner and Erwin, 2005). The influence of high temperature on the growth of primary stems and floral development was studied by exposing the plants to 37\u00b0C for 16 h and returning them to 22\u00b0C. Growth was assessed daily. While the elongation of the primary stem of the wild-type (Ws) was only slightly reduced compared to non-treated controls (Ws) upon heat stress, it was considerably reduced in AtCHR12ov (Figure 3a) and AtCHR12_tov plants (Figure S1a). During the first 3 days after heat treatment, development of flower buds was arrested in both wild-type (Ws) and mutant plants. However, after 5 days of recovery, wild-type plants continued to flower (except for two or three aborted buds), whereas about 90% of the mutant plants showed the type of growth arrest of the primary inflorescence observed for drought-stressed plants (data not shown). Knockout atchr12 plants treated in the same way showed slightly better growth than their corresponding wild-type (Col). This difference was statistically significant during the first 5 days after the application of heat stress (Figure 3b and Table S1).",
                        "To investigate the heat response during other developmental stages, 3-day-old in vitro-grown seedlings were exposed to 37\u00b0C or 42\u00b0C for 5 h. Following heat treatment, seedlings were allowed to recover at 22\u00b0C for 5 days, and the length of the roots was measured. Both temperatures had a negative effect on root growth, but the growth of atchr12 roots was less inhibited than in its corresponding wild-type (Col), particularly at 42\u00b0C (Figure 3c). The response of the AtCHR12ov mutant did not differ from that of its corresponding wild-type (Ws) (data not shown).",
                        "The responses of both AtCHR12 mutants to high-salt stress were investigated using a root elongation assay (Achard et al., 2006). Three-day-old seedlings were transferred to agar plates containing a range of concentrations (0-150 mM) of NaCl, and root length was measured after 5 days of incubation. There was no difference in the root length of wild-type (Ws) and AtCHR12ov seedlings at any of the salt concentrations analyzed (Figure 4a). However, the growth of atchr12 roots was less inhibited by salt than that of its corresponding wild-type (Col), particularly at lower salt concentrations (Figure 4b).",
                        "These data indicate that the activity of AtCHR12 is related to stress-induced temporary growth arrest. For both drought and heat stress, the response of the knockout mutant is less pronounced, but tends to go in the opposite direction compared to the response of the overexpressing mutants."

The high GUS activity was specifically localized in developing cauline leaves in the early stages of their development, when they overlie the emerging inflorescences (Figure 5e,f). GUS activity was diminished in mature cauline leaves during growth of primary stems. In flowering plants, the GUS signal was detected in sepals of young flower buds (Figure 5g).

The most upregulated gene identified was AtCHR12 (11-fold). For nine genes selected, semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the differential expression observed in the exploratory microarray analysis (Figure 6). Among these are At5 g07370, potentially involved in signal transduction (Stevenson-Paulik et al., 2002), and several putative transcriptional regulators. The transcriptional factors At4 g37610 and At2 g44840 have been linked to stress responses in previous studies (Du and Poovaiah, 2004;Onate-Sanchez and Singh, 2002). Two other differentially expressed genes could be associated with the temporary growth arrest phenotype: dormancy/auxin-associated genes. These genes, AtDRM1 (At1g28330) and AtDRM1-homolog (At2g33830), showed 3-and 4.6-fold upregulation in the microarray analysis, respectively. For these two genes, the differential expression was also confirmed by RNA blot analysis (data not shown). The AtDRM1-type genes are the Arabidopsis orthologs of the pea dormancy-associated gene PsDRM1 (Stafstrom et al., 1997).

The relative expression level of AtDRM1 genes differed in the two accessions used (Ws and Col). Higher levels of expression were seen in Col in both inflorescence and leaves (Figure 7a,b). In contrast, atchr12 showed reduced expression levels of both genes in both inflorescence and leaves compared to its wild-type (Col; Figure 7a,b). This suggests that a high level of AtCHR12 expression is priming the plants to enter the processes that turn actively growing tissue into dormant-like tissue."

Without application of environmental stress, only a few plants that overexpress the AtCHR12 gene showed growth arrest of both the primary inflorescence and its stem. This phenotype was increased considerably after stress treatment, either drought or heat. The rare and unpredictable occurrence of growth arrest under controlled growth conditions may reflect a stochastic exposure to unintended stress. Overexpression of AtCHR12 did not interfere with plant growth and development after the stress was relieved. Relative to their wildtype (Col), the knockout plants show less growth reduction (are taller), whereas overexpressing mutants show more growth reduction (are smaller) relative to their wild-type (Ws), showing that the mutants respond in opposite direction relative to their wild-types. However, the relative response of the knockout line is smaller than that of the overexpressing mutants. The growth arrest in wild-type plants after stress treatment is relatively small and statistically not significantly different from the untreated controls. This small window of possible change in wild-type plants reduces the possibility of detecting significant changes in a knockout line. In root assays, the knockout line shows more growth compared to the wild-type. However, in these assays, the overexpressing line shows no difference from the wild-type. This lack of phenotype is thought to reflect the complexity of the regulation of chromatin-remodeling proteins. Remodelers interact with their targets through transcriptional regulators. Possibly root cells lack the interacting regulators required for AT-CHR12 action. The highly specific expression of AtCHR12 in the endodermis of roots (Figure 5) could indicate that ectopic overexpression of AtCHR12 does not exceed the expression level in the wildtype. As a result, there is no difference in root growth between the two.",

Slower growth could allow plants to redirect resources to overcome or temporarily cope with stress. When the growth arrest response is perturbed by mutations, plants could either ignore or over-react to stress. This reaction will depend on the type of the mutation and the severity of the stress applied. The relatively mild stress conditions that we applied most likely explain why the atchr12 knockout plants grew better than wild-type plants under the same stress. The knockout does not experience the stress as the wild-type does and does not react with growth arrest. However, we predict that, upon more severe stress, the lack of growth arrest will be more damaging to the atchr12 plants than to the wild-type.",

                        "In yeast and animal systems, SNF2-class ATPases such as ATCHR12 have been shown to be particularly involved in inducible or increased gene expression (Narlikar et al., 2002;Sudarsanam and Winston, 2000). In the AtCHR12ov mutant, microarray survey analysis identified several genes that are expressed at higher levels and are involved in stress and stress-related phenomena, notably dormancy. Dormancy allows plants and their organs to cease growth under adverse conditions and to resume growth when endogenous or environmental conditions improve (Horvath et al., 2003). The differential expression of the AtCHR12 gene is accompanied by notable changes in expression of the two Arabidopsis orthologs of the pea dormancy-associated gene PsDRM1 (Stafstrom et al., 1997). In pea, PsDRM1 is highly expressed in dormant buds, but expression is undetectable in growing buds. In addition, this gene is expressed at much higher levels in non-growing stems and roots than in their growing counterparts. Therefore, it is considered to be an excellent marker for the dormant state (Stafstrom et al., 1998). In Arabidopsis, high expression of AtDRM1-type genes is also associated with dormant buds (Tatematsu et al., 2005). The effect of AtCHR12 on expression of these genes suggests that they are involved in the establishment of dormancy-like growth arrest. Both AtDRM1 genes have been shown to be induced in response to various stresses. AtDRM1 (At1 g28330) is upregulated by ionizing radiation (Sahr et al., 2005), bacterial colonization (Cartieaux et al., 2003), exposure to the phloem-feeding aphid Myzus persicae (De Vos et al., 2005), cold stress (Maruyama et al., 2004), and sucrose or phosphate starvation (Contento et al., 2004;Wu et al., 2003). The AtDRM1homolog (At2g33830) is highly activated by M. persicae as well as by osmotic and wounding stress. In contrast to the upregulation of both AtDRM1 genes in the AtCHR12ov mutant, their expression in the atchr12 knockout was significantly reduced. Therefore, it is possible that the regulation of AtDRM1 gene expression contributes to growth arrest. However, a causal relationship between growth regulation and altered expression of the DRM1 genes remains to be demonstrated. The microarray data available in the public domain suggests that the expression of AtCHR12 itself is not influenced by stress. For example, the response viewers of Genevestigator (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/; Zimmermann et al., 2005) and eFP Browser (http://bbc. botany.utoronto.ca) do not indicate any significant change in AtCHR12 expression in response to various stresses. This suggests that, if there is any change in expression of AtCHR12 in relation to stress, it is either too subtle, too temporary or too cell-specific to be easily detected. The expression of genes associated with reduced growth, such as the AtDRM1 genes, is affected by changes in AtCHR12 expression in the absence of stress. We therefore propose that, under stress conditions, their expression is upregulated through post-translational modification of ATCHR12 or other protein-protein interactions. For example, stress could be promoting the activity of transcriptional regulators cooperating with ATCHR12 in the regulation of growth arrest."

                        "In contrast to other members of the Arabidopsis SNF/ Brahma subfamily, such as SYD and AtBRM (Farrona et al., 2004;Wagner and Meyerowitz, 2002), ATCHR12 was not detectably expressed in the shoot apical meristem (data not shown). A cause of the reduced growth rate after stress could be inadequate photosynthesis. However, stress might also directly inhibit cell division and expansion. Based on data currently available, we are not able to conclude in which of these processes, division and/or expansion, AtCHR12 might be involved. Further analysis of the cellular localization of translational fusions of ATCHR12 will contribute to understanding its role in the regulation of growth.",
                        "In addition to its role in controlling stress-induced growth arrest, the AtCHR12 gene may be involved in other stages of plant development where temporary growth arrest could play a role. In developing seeds, AtCHR12 is activated at the mid-torpedo stage, and the high activity persists throughout the maturation phase, characterized by an interruption of growth (Raz et al., 2001). AtCHR12 is still active in resulting dry seeds. After germination, its activity in growing seedlings declines. This may indicate a role of ATCHR12 in growth arrest during embryo maturation and/or establishment of seed dormancy (Raz et al., 2001).",
                        "The spatial distribution of promoter activity in pCHR12::GUS lines supports the assumption of AtCHR12 involvement in stress responses. For example, the particularly high GUS activity in young cauline leaves enclosing emerging buds, or in sepals of young flowers, could indicate that AtCHR12 gene expression is required for the growth arrest of young buds in environmentally adverse conditions. The high GUS activity in stipules may indicate the protection of bud tissue, although the stipules in Arabidopsis seem to be too small for such a role. In roots, expression of AtCHR12 is largely restricted to the endodermis of the division zone. Roots are the primary sensors of soil-borne stresses such as drought and salt. Many stress-related genes are highly expressed in roots (Chen et al., 2002), which suggests the presence of important root-specific adaptation mechanisms.",
                        "ATCHR12-mediated priming for growth arrest differs from DELLA-controlled growth restraint DELLA proteins are major players in regulatory mechanisms for plant growth (Fleet and Sun, 2005). They are thought to be nuclear transcriptional regulators that antagonize the growth-enhancing effect of gibberellins (GAs). The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) counteracts the action of GAs, and is a key player in plant responses to adverse environmental cues (Himmelbach et al., 2003). Recently, the DELLA proteins were reported to be essential for the induction of growth restraint upon salinity stress in an ABA-dependent manner. The growth of roots of an Arabidopsis 'quadruple DELLA mutant', with four out of five genes downregulated, was less inhibited by salt stress than growth of the roots of wild-type plants (Achard et al., 2006). This is similar to the response of the atchr12 mutant to salt stress, raising the possibility that DELLAs and ATCHR12 act in the same pathway. However, seedlings of both types of AtCHR12 mutants grown in vitro on medium with 1 or 10 lM ABA did not reveal any differences in the effect of ABA on root growth or flowering time compared to their wild-type controls (data not shown). Such differences were reported for DELLA mutants (Achard et al., 2006). These results indicate that AtCHR12-associated growth arrest is ABA-independent and differs from DELLA-mediated growth restraint. A DELLAindependent mechanism of growth arrest has been suggested to explain the incomplete resistance of the quadruple DELLA mutants when salt stressed (Achard et al., 2006). An interesting difference between DELLA-controlled growth restraint and AtCHR12-associated priming for growth arrest is that gain-of-function DELLA mutants show a constitutive dwarf phenotype caused by reduced GA responses (Fu et al., 2001). In contrast, the growth restraint in the AtCHR12ov mutant is stress-dependent and reversible."

                        "An overexpressing AtCHR12ov mutant in the Wassilijewskaja (Ws) genetic background was identified in a population of activationtagged lines generated using the En-I maize transposon system described previously (Marsch-Martinez et al., 2002). From a population of about 1700 stable, single-copy insertion lines (A. Pereira, Plant Research International (PRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands, unpublished data), the flanking sequences were determined and blasted against the genomic sequences of all known or predicted chromatin-remodeling genes from ChromDB (http://www. chromdb.org). In each case, the transcribed region and 10 kb of upstream and downstream sequences were included in the Blast analysis. The loss-of-function mutant atchr12, line SALK_105458 in the Columbia (Col) background, was generated by J.R. Ecker (Salk Institute of Genomics Analysis Laboratory, USA) and is distributed by NASC (Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre, UK) (Scholl et al., 2000). A single insertion is present in this line. For both mutants, plants of the F 3 generation homozygous for the insertion were used. Homozygosity was confirmed by plating seeds on plates with 15 mg l )1 phosphinothricin (AtCHR12ov) or 50 mg l )1 kanamycin (atchr12). To synchronize germination, seeds were imbibed in distilled water for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. For heat stress, 3-week-old (Ws background) or 4-week-old (Col background) plants were placed for 16 h in a growth chamber at 37\u00b0C and subsequently returned to 22\u00b0C for recovery. For both treatments, floral development was assessed visually; the stem length of individual plants was measured using a ruler as the distance from the base to the first flower on the stem. For root elongation assays, seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on 0.8% w/v Daishin agar (Duchefa), 0.5\u2022 MS medium (Duchefa) supplemented with 1% w/v sucrose and 0.5 g l )1 MES, pH 5.8. Following cold treatment for 3 days at 4\u00b0C in darkness, seedlings were grown in a controlled growth chamber with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 22\u00b0C in vertical position. Three-day-old seedlings were transferred to plates supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 100 or 150 mM NaCl and grown in vertical position. Five days later, the root length of 20-30 seedlings was measured. Heat treatments were performed on 3day-old seedlings growing on plates that were placed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C or 42\u00b0C for 5 h. After recovery at 22\u00b0C for 5 days, the length of the roots was measured and compared to that of untreated controls."

T-DNA integration into the first exon of the AtCHR12 gene in the atchr12 mutant was confirmed using a gene-specific primer (5\u00a2-GCCTCACCCTAGATTTTGATG-3\u00a2) and a primer (5\u00a2-GCGTGGAC-CGCTTGCTGCAACT-3\u00a2) from the left border of the T-DNA (LBb1). Methods for DNA isolation and RT-PCR conditions were as described previously (Mlynarova and Nap, 2003;Mlynarova et al., 2003). Two micrograms of total RNA were used to synthesize first-strand cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA was diluted 50 times, and was first used for amplification using ubiquitin primers (32 cycles) to equalize the concentrations of the cDNA samples. Subsequently, appropriately diluted cDNA was used for PCR reactions (35 cycles) using gene-specific primers. Reactions for control and tested genes were performed in parallel, but in separate tubes. For each gene, a series of diluted cDNA was taken and adjusted to ensure that the PCR product obtained was generated in the exponential stage of amplification. The lowest amount of cDNA still giving an ethidium bromide-stained product was taken to for comparison. The products were visualized on 1.2-1.5% agarose gels. Sequences of primers used to confirm microarray data are given in Table S2."

The full-length sequence was obtained with three sets of primers: CHRIfor 5\u00a2-GGATCCTCATGAAGGCTCAGCAGCTCCAAGAG-3\u00a2 and CHRIrev 5\u00a2-CCTTCTAATTGATAGGATCGTAG-3\u00a2, amplifying fragment I from sequence 1-2290 bp; CHRIIfor 5\u00a2-GGCTATCCATTCAATACAAGAG-3\u00a2 and CHRIIrev 5\u00a2-GGGTTCCAATCACTGTCAAG-3\u00a2, amplifying fragment II from sequence 2120-3888 bp; CHRIIIfor 5\u00a2-CAAT-TCAACGAGCCAGATTCTC-3\u00a2 and CHRIIIrev 5\u00a2-CTCGAGTCAT TTTCGTCTACTTCCAT-3\u00a2, amplifying fragment III from sequence 3791-4850 bp. The BamHI and SstI sites (underlined) were introduced via the PCR primers for cloning purposes. All fragments were cloned into pGEM-Teasy (Promega; http://www.promega.com/) and their integrity was verified by sequencing. Next, the cloned fragments were assembled into the gene sequence: fragment I (BamHI-XbaI) was fused to fragment II (XbaI-PstI) and fragment III (PstI-SstI). An XbaI restriction site is present at position 2269 in the AtCHR12 gene; PstI is a unique restriction site at position 3853. The full gene sequence was ligated to the potato Lhca3.St.1 promoter (Nap et al., 1993). Using Gateway technology (Invitrogen; http:// www.invitrogen.com/), the whole cassette was introduced into the vector pBnRGW (unpublished data). This binary vector consists of the backbone sequence of pB7GWIWG2(II) (http://www.psb. ugent.be/gateway/index.php) into which the napin promoter-DsRFP-nosT cassette from pFLUAR 101 (Stuitje et al., 2003), the Gateway exchange cassette and the nosT polyadenylation sequence were introduced by replacing the XbaI-HindIII T-DNA fragment using standard cloning. The final binary vector was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 (pMP9) and used for transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Ws) according to the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998)."
