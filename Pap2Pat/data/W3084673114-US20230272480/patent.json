                        "Classifying neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) is challenging due to tumor diversity, inconsistent terminology, and piecemeal molecular characterization. Currently, NENs are broadly divided into epithelial or non-epithelial groups based on site of origin and differences in keratin and other gene expression; each group comprising multiple pathological types (i.e., tumor types). To facilitate comparisons between NENs from different anatomical sites, a common classification framework has been proposed in which the terms \u2018category\u2019, \u2018family\u2019, \u2018type\u2019 and \u2018grade\u2019, respectively, denote predominant neuroendocrine differentiation, degree of differentiation, diagnostic entity, and inherent biological activity [1]. While morphological assessment and immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and Ki-67 proteins remain indispensable for confirming neuroendocrine differentiation and assessing tumor grade, other relevant molecular findings will be integrated into this framework over time. Such studies will help to answer many questions in NEN biology, including delineating the molecular differences between well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and finding regulatory molecules.",
                        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (e.g., 19-24 nt) regulatory RNA molecules that can also be used to classify cancer. miRNAs are highly informative tissue markers because of their abundance, cell-type and disease-stage specificity, and stability in fresh and archived materials such as tissues and biofluids. These molecules also provide valuable mechanistic insights into cellular processes due to computationally predictable interactions with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In addition, miRNA expression profiles can be used to assess data reliability and to prioritize mRNA targets through further organization into miRNA cluster and sequence family datasets. To date, multiple miRNA profiling studies have been performed on single or limited combinations of NEN pathological types using different RNA isolation, detection, and analysis methods. The differences in approaches complicate interstudy comparisons, limiting the extent to biological and clinically relevant insights into NEN biology can be gained."

                        "One aspect of the invention relates to methods for classifying a neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) in a subject. According to certain embodiments, methods for classifying NENs may be based on comprehensive miRNA expression profiling and data mining of multiple pathological types. Reference miRNA expression profiles were generated for multiple NEN pathological types and site-matched non-NEN controls, candidate category and type specific miRNAs were identified that may be used for classification and as adjunct tissue markers, and evidence for constitutive and convergent miRNA gene expression in epithelial and nonepithelial NENs was found. Through these advances a multilayer classifier for discriminating NEN pathological types was developed, and reference profiles were provided.",
                        "In some embodiments, methods may include comparing multiple NEN pathological types and site-matched non-NEN controls using comprehensive miRNA detection through barcoded small RNA cDNA library sequencing [14] and accurate sequence annotation [10].",
                        "In some embodiments, advanced computational approaches for miRNA feature selection and classifier construction may be employed. Such approaches may include assessing data reliability through knowledge of miRNA cluster composition [5], evaluating classifier performance and transferability by determining overall and decision node level accuracy, assessing impact of miRNA cluster substitutions on accuracy, and assessing the abundance of selected classificatory miRNAs. In one embodiment, miRNA clusters may be used as a measure of data quality and transferability of miRNAs as clinical markers; and candidate miRNAs may be used to build a streamlined NEN classification tool. The identified miRNAs may also be used as mono-analyte or multi-analyte markers as needed.",
                        "In some embodiments, expression levels of at least two selected miRNAs in a biological sample are determined and are then subjected to a discriminator function that classifies cancer according to the expression levels of the at least two miRNAs. In some embodiments the biological sample may be a sample of the cancer, such as a tissue sample. In other embodiments the biological sample may be a liquid sample, such as blood.",
                        "In one embodiment at least one miRNA is miR-375. In another embodiment, at least two miRNAs are miR-375 and miR-7. Expression levels of miR-375 and miR-7 may be subjected to a discriminator function that classifies the cancer as a NEN or a non-NEN.",
                        "In other embodiments expression levels of additional miRNAs in the biological sample may be measured, and these expression levels additionally subjected to a discriminator function based on a hierarchical classifier having additional classifier layers. For example, after determining whether a cancer is a NEN or a non-NEN in a first classifier layer based on expression levels of at least one miR, such as miR-375, the discriminator function may then determine a NEN pathological type based on miR expression level(s) of one or more additional miR(s) in a second classifier layer. Classification may proceed this way over multiple classifier layers using one or more additional miR(s) expression level(s). For example, FIGS. 3A and 3B show embodiments of discriminator functions with multi-layer classifiers operating on expression levels of multiple miRNAs over the classifier layers. These are described in detail below. Table 3 lists and provides sequences of miRNAs that may be used in embodiments based on this approach. The sequences listed are the dominant sequences where, in general, regions comprising nucleotides 2-8 in each sequence are most important and are highly conserved. It will be appreciated that substitutions, deletions, or additions of, e.g., one or two nucleotides outside of the highly conserved regions are acceptable as such variants would not negatively affect performance of classifier embodiments.",
                        "According to another aspect of the invention, methods and discriminator constructs (e.g., software products) are provided for discriminating between two or more conditions of interest (i.e., \u201cn\u201d conditions of interest) in a dataset. FIG. 1A is a flow chart showing a generalized process for constructing a discriminator function. Referring to FIG. 1A, a dataset (e.g., raw data) 102 obtained from a measuring, sampling, profiling, etc., regimen or modality is used as input. Examples of types of data include, but are not limited to, omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.), imaging (e.g., ultrasound, x-ray, LiDAR, etc.) as may be applied to fields such as medical, geophysical/seismic, mechanical (e.g., non-destructive inspection), electromagnetic spectra, etc. Data are collected from samples, e.g., individual clinical specimens, biological samples, individual images, geophysical sampling locations, etc. Examples of conditions of interest include, but are not limited to: whether or not a patient has cancer or a cancer subtype, determined from omics data; whether or not a mechanical component is defective or damaged, determined from ultrasonic imaging data; whether or not an ore deposit is present, determined from seismic survey data. Whereas embodiments are described below primarily with respect to data related to miRNA expression, it will be readily understood that they are applicable to other types of data.",
                        "The data may be subjected to preprocessing 104. Preprocessing may include one or more treatment to improve overall rigor of the discriminator function. For example, preprocessing may include one or more of filtering of features (e.g., with respect to a specific threshold), normalizing, transforming, detecting and filtering sample outliers and batch effects, standardizing etc.",
                        "To construct the discriminator function several steps may be implemented at 110. First, the preprocessed data are subjected to one or more feature selection algorithms 112. A feature selection algorithm may rank data by discriminating between two class labels, i.e., between two conditions of interest. Feature selection may be performed for all pairwise comparisons of the multiple conditions of interest. The feature selection algorithm(s) may use a feature matrix and class labels as input and return a cross-validated average ranking of each feature. Since the accuracy of feature selection methods varies for different datasets, an ensemble of different feature selection algorithms based on diverse selection methods and families of predictors may be used to evaluate features according to different criteria. Cross validation may be used for all feature selection algorithms to ensure that ranking is generalizable and to avoid overfitting of the subsequent prediction model. Univariable and/or multivariable feature ranking algorithms may be used. For example, one or more feature selection algorithm may be univariable and one or more other feature selection algorithm may be multivariable. Univariable and multivariable feature ranking algorithms may rely on filter, wrapper, and/or embedded techniques. Filter techniques may include feature ranking based on one or more of, e.g., mutual information, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) criteria, Wilcoxon criteria, ReliefF analysis for classification, and Treebagger predictor importance. Wrapper feature selection algorithms may include one or more of, e.g., support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), trees, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, etc. Embedded techniques combine the characteristics of filter and wrapper methods and the feature selection may become part of a trained machine learning model, and may include Random Forests technique. The output of each feature selection may be a numeric matrix with standardized ranking, e.g., between 0 (lowest) and 1 (highest) for each feature. The results of all the algorithms may be passed through a further algorithm that performs a final ranking, such as a greedy ensemble ranking algorithm that assigns a final ranking and returns a ranked version of the input dataset. In some embodiments weighting is used to give more priority to some algorithms over others.",
                        "Following feature selection, the selected features are subjected to evaluation 114. As an example, feature evaluation may include inspecting top-ranking (e.g., the top 5% to 25%) discriminating features that can be used for building an accurate prediction model. Evaluation may include visual inspection (e.g., for grouping, wherein a higher degree of grouping of features has a greater potential for accurate classification), applying domain knowledge such as consideration of significance of a particular feature (e.g., the biological role of a protein or miR) and/or consideration of miRNA specificity between different tissues and cells, dominance within the data set (e.g., level of expression of a nucleic acid sequence or miR), supporting evidence for other miR cistron members, wherein similar expression levels of two or more cistronic miRNAs confirms data integrity (cistronic miRNAs are typically located within about 5 kb of each other in intergenic regions or within the same intron/exon and are co-transcribed and yield similar read counts for each member of a given miRNA cistron, also referred to herein as clusters). The evaluation 114 may confirm relevance of candidate features in the overall results in identification of key features in the dataset that are used as input to one or more classifiers 116. For example, in embodiments where the dataset is miRNA expression levels, evaluation results in the identification of candidate miRNAs that can be used to classify cancer. The feature selection and evaluation may result in a subset of features for building a generalizable classifier.",
                        "Following evaluation, the selected subset of features is subjected to classification 116. For example, the selected subset of features may be identified (in steps 112 and 114) as the most valuable predictors to use in constructing a classification model for all pairwise comparisons of the multiple conditions to discriminate among the multiple conditions of interest within the data. Various classification algorithms are available, for example, one or more of the classification algorithms in the MATLAB Classification Learner App (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Mass., USA) may be evaluated during construction of the model.",
                        "Implementing the classifier model includes the discriminator function performing a hierarchical classification for each condition of the multiple (i.e., n) conditions of interest. For example, as shown in FIG. 1A, upon outputting a first classification result 120 corresponding to a first condition of interest, if there remain conditions of interest, the process is returned 118 for classification according to a next condition of interest whereupon samples are subjected to further feature selection and ranking 112, further evaluation 114, and further classification 116, and a second output includes second classification result corresponding to a second condition of interest. The hierarchical approach continues this way until all samples have been classified according to the n multiple conditions of interest. At this point a layered discriminator function is constructed with feature selection and ranking, feature evaluation, and classification functions and algorithms (i.e., parameters) that are selected and stored for each condition of then multiple conditions of interest for the particular type of data in the dataset. Consequently, the discriminator function may then be applied to another dataset of the same type of data, wherein the discriminator function automatically performs the hierarchical classification across the multiple conditions of interest. That is, no further feature selection and ranking, feature evaluation, and selection of classification algorithms is necessary to perform the hierarchical classification when the same type of data are used.",
                        "FIG. 1B is an exemplary flowchart for a process including a hierarchical discriminator function constructed as described above. The discriminator function may be constructed for use with a dataset 152 such as, for example, miRNA expression data. In a particular example related to the methods for identifying cancer described herein, the hierarchical discriminator function is constructed for classifying cancer according to multiple conditions of interest including whether the cancer is NEN or non-NEN, and further, if the cancer is NEN, then the conditions may include classifying the NEN cancer according to a specific pathological (tumor) type. As shown in FIG. 1B, the dataset is subjected to preprocessing 154. In certain embodiments, described in detail below, the constructed hierarchical discriminator function 160 may have a hierarchical classifier 162 architecture such as that shown in FIG. 3A or 3B, which show multiple conditions of interest as multiple NEN cancer subtypes. An example of a set of instructions for a hierarchical classifier such as that shown in FIG. 3B is provided in Example 2, below. According to such embodiments, hierarchical classification proceeds for the n conditions of interest 164 and the hierarchical classifier may output a classification result 170 for any of the multiple conditions of interest, e.g., NEN cancer subtypes, as shown in FIGS. 3A or 3B.",
                        "Embodiments of software products include computer code containing instructions to direct a processor to receive a dataset and implement a process for selecting features and classifiers and constructing a discriminator function as described above (e.g., a process comprising all or a part of that shown in FIG. 1A), or to direct the processor to receive a dataset and implement a discriminator function based on pre-selected features and classifiers as described above (e.g., a process comprising all or a part of that shown in FIG. 1B). Data preprocessing may of course be performed separately such that preprocessed data is input to the systems shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B at steps 112 and 162, respectively. Accordingly, data preprocessing may be an optional feature or may be omitted in software products based on FIGS. 1A and 1B. The processor may be part of a computer or a data processing system, and may execute a graphical user interface (GUI) presented on a display screen and adapted for receiving commands from a user of the system and prompting the user for input at various steps. The processor analyzes data and outputs results and displays results on the display screen. For example, the data processing system may be a server system, and the computer may be a personal computer (PC) or tablet-based computer.",
                        "Another aspect of the invention provides programmed media for use with a processor, comprising code stored on non-transitory storage media compatible with the processor, the code containing instructions to direct the processor to receive a dataset and implement a process for constructing a discriminator function as described above (e.g., a process such as that shown in FIG. 1A), or to direct the processor to receive a dataset and implement a discriminator function as described above (e.g., a process such as that shown in FIG. 1B).",
                        "According to another aspect of the invention, there are provided herein comprehensive data (e.g., Tables 1A and 1B, FIGS. 2A and 2B) showing for the first time elevated expression of miR-375 in a broad range of NEN pathological types, thus demonstrating the utility of miR-375 as a pan-NEN biomarker. As described herein, the expression level of miRNA may be measured in substantially any NEN pathological type to provide a rapid and convenient assessment of a patient. Practical uses may include, for example, differentiating between NEN and non-NEN, diagnosing a NEN pathological type, monitoring disease state/patient condition, determining prognosis, evaluating response to a treatment, evaluating effectiveness of a treatment, etc.",
                        "Thus, provided herein are methods for one or more of diagnosing a NEN pathological type, monitoring disease state/patient condition, determining prognosis, evaluating response to a treatment, and/or evaluating effectiveness of a treatment in a subject with a NEN cancer. The methods comprise obtaining a biological sample from the subject and measuring expression levels of at least two miRNAs in the biological sample, wherein at least a first miRNA is a biomarker in NEN cancer. In some embodiments, the first miRNA is miR-375 and at least a second miRNA may be one or more other miRNAs that may be present in the biological sample. Examples of other miRNAs that may be present in the biological sample include, but are not limited to, miR-7, miR-21, miR-451, and miR-486. In some embodiments, the first miRNA is miR-375and at least a second miRNA is added to the biological sample as a standard. An example of a miRNA that may be added to the sample as a standard is a miRNA that may be easily detected, e.g., a non-human miRNA, such as miR-159a. The expression levels of the at least a first miRNA and the at least a second miRNA are compared, wherein a high expression level of the at least a first miRNA relative to the at least a second miRNA is indicative of NEN in the subject. Comparing may include comparing miRNA expression levels to control levels, such as levels of the miRNAs in samples from subjects without cancer. Comparing may include comparing the expression level of the at least a first miRNA to the expression level of the standard added to the biological sample. Moreover, by obtaining two or more measures of the at least a first miRNA from the subject over time, prognosis, response to a treatment, and/or effectiveness of a treatment in the subject with a NEN cancer can be determined.",
                        "In one embodiment the miRNA expression levels may be measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an expression level of the at least a first miRNA s may be generated based on comparison to that of at least a second miRNA using the delta-Ct method. In one embodiment the biological sample may be a sample of the cancer, such as a tissue sample. In other embodiments the biological sample may be a liquid sample, such as blood. In one embodiment the at least a first miRNA is miR-375."

Sample outliers and batch effects were identified through correlation analyses [11] of miRNA expression profiles and excluded from the final dataset to increase study rigor. These analyses were completed for each NEN pathological type or site-matched non-NEN control group prior to preprocessing of the combined sample set. Sequencing data were of sufficient quality for 221 (92%) of 239 NEN cases and 114 (82%) of 139 non-NEN controls. Most excluded samples were individual outliers, except for 10 non-NEN samples from a single sequencing run. Following preprocessing, all non-human miRNAs and human miRNA STAR sequences were excluded from further analyses. To exclude miRNAs or miRNA clusters with low expression across samples, a filtering threshold was applied as described [3]; specific filtering thresholds were set as a percentile of overall expression as indicated below.",

In the first layer, miR-200a expression was significantly higher in epithelial than non-epithelial NENs (K-W P-value <0.01); miR-10b provided additional prediction power (K-W P-value <0.01). When combined, these two miRNAs discriminated epithelial and non-epithelial NENs with only one sample misclassification (FIG. 4A), which was found to be a histological misidentification (see below). In subsequent layers, sample profiles were successively assigned to other pathological types using the least number of miRNAs required.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin A and GATA3, and negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3 antibodies). This phenotype diagnosed this tumor as a PGL, as predicted by the miRNA classifier, and not a PanNET, which should be cytokeratin-positive and GATA3-negative [12,13].

                                "Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of filtered miRNA expression profiles provided new knowledge of NEN grouping. With the exception of all PTA and one LCNEC sample, NEN cases and non-NEN controls clustered separately. Based on these findings, it is suggested that all PTA have a distinct gene expression pattern linked to their indolent behavior; the LCNEC sample showed areas of possible squamous cell differentiation (data not shown) that may explain peculiar clustering patterns. Within NENs, two major groups corresponding to epithelial and non-epithelial NENs are evident; interestingly, one epithelial NEN clusters with non-epithelial NEN samples. The results show that these epithelial and non-epithelial NENs can be discriminated through miR-200a and miR-10b expression, and confirm that the epithelial PanNET sample is actually a non-epithelial PGL based on additional cytokeratin and GATA-3 immunostaining. Within non-NENs, samples group mostly by anatomical site of origin as expected [3]. Visual inspection of cluster diagrams indicates similarities and differences in abundant miRNA composition in NEN and non-NEN samples.",
                                "Similarities in abundant miRNA composition between samples provide coarse insights into cellular gene expression programs. Within NENs, miR-375, -21, -143, -let-7a, -26a, -7, -let-7f, -125b and -141 were highly expressed in five or more pathological types. miR-375, the most abundant miRNA in NENs, is believed to regulate lineage-specific differentiation, growth, and function of neuroendocrine cells. Correlation analyses highlighted similarities in abundant miRNA composition for all NENs, including epithelial or non-epithelial NENs. These findings indicate that all NENs have a constitutive miRNA gene expression program that likely directly or indirectly maintains the neuroendocrine cell phenotype. Given the different cellular ori gins of epithelial and non-epithelial NENs, convergent miRNA gene expression likely implies functional similarities. Within non-NEN samples, miR-21, -let-7a, -143, -30a, -let-7b and -30d were highly expressed in five or more non-NEN entities.",
                                "Differences in abundant miRNA composition between samples can also be used to identify new and confirm known miRNA markers. miR-375 expression was substantially higher in all NEN cases compared to non-NEN controls. Where comparisons allowed, miR-375 was consistently higher in NEN pathological types compared to site-matched non-NEN controls. Based on current miRNA expression tissue atlases, miR-375 is currently believed to be an endocrine gland specific marker [3,15]. However, the presence of miR-375 in enteroendocrine cells, pancreatic beta cells, thyroid C cells, and MCC, NB, and SCLC cell lines suggests that miR-375 is a neuroendocrine cell marker. Given the specificity and distribution of miR-375 in the samples herein and its reported abundance in seemingly disparate NEN pathological types, it is suggested herein that miR-375 is a universal marker of neuroendocrine cell differentiation. miR-375 appears to be highly expressed in NENs, in amounts proportional to the number of normal neuroendocrine cells and/or the degree of neuroendocrine differentiation within control tissues or tumors; neuroendocrine differentiation of tumors is more common than currently appreciated [16]. More systematic studies will confirm this suggestion.",
                                "Although less abundant than miR-375, miR-7 expression was also elevated in all NEN cases compared to non-NEN controls. Where comparisons allowed, miR-7 was often higher in NEN pathological types compared to site-matched non-NEN controls. Other than expression in the pituitary gland, atlas studies provide limited information on miR-7 expression [3,15]. However, the presence of miR-7 in enteroendocrine cells, pancreatic islet cells, thyroid C cells, but not controls suggests that this miRNA also has some degree of neuroendocrine specificity. Thus, provided herein is a method for determining NEN or non-NEN based on miR-375 and miR-7 expression, wherein high miR-375 and miR-7 indicate NEN, otherwise, low miR-375 and miR-7 indicate non-NEN. The determination of NEN or non-NEN may be made using differential expression techniques or using a classifier, for example as shown in Example 2. Given their specificity, some prior tissue profiling studies may have inadvertently interpreted miR-375 or miR-7 reduction in expansile cancer lesions as miRNA reduction rather than neuroendocrine cell destruction. Although miR-127 was higher in TC than non-NEN controls, the significance of this difference is unclear. Conversely, comparisons of abundant miRNA composition between non-NEN and NEN samples identified known tissue-specific miRNA markers such as miR-203 and miR-205 [3].",
                                "A feature selection algorithm was used to identify 17 miRNAs to discriminate 15 NEN pathological types (FIG. 3A); t-SNE analyses using these miRNAs clearly separated epithelial and non-epithelial NENs and provided clustering by pathological type. Given their classificatory potential, these miRNAs were used to construct and validate multilayer classifiers for discriminating NEN pathological types. One embodiment correctly identified 217 (98%) of 221 samples. Three of the four misclassified samples occurred at the GEP NEN versus lung NEN decision node, suggesting model over-fitting and the need for additional samples for validation. On further testing, the fourth \u2018misclassified\u2019 sample turned out to be a PGL as indicated by miRNA expression profiling. Criteria for evaluating classifier performance and transferability, including determining overall and decision node level accuracy, assessing the impact of miRNA cluster substitutions on classifier accuracy, and showing the relative abundance of miRNAs selected for classification were developed.",
                                "Anatomical location and diagnostic histopathological information are presented for 221 NEN cases, comprising 15 pathological types from seven anatomical sites, and 114 site-matched non-NEN controls, comprising seven diagnostic entities from five anatomical sites.

                                "Using the multilayer classifier of FIG. 3A, NEN miRNA profiles were assigned to one of nine pathological subgroups or pathological types. Cases of GEP NENs (AppNET, INET, PNET, RNET) or lung NENs (TC, AC, SCLC, LCNEC) were not assigned to individual pathological types because of previously developed miRNA-based classifiers for these subgroups [9]. By comparing classifier designations to established histopathological diagnoses, overall classifier accuracy was 98%. Additional measures of classifier performance were also calculated: precision (0.98), recall (0.99) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.98). Sample abbreviations are provided in Table 1.",

First, samples are labeled with relevant clinical information (diagnosis, pathologic type, tumor grade, stage, and treatment response). Next, features that determine the two groups above are identified and ranked using a feature selection algorithm and evaluated using knowledge of miRNA abundance, tissue specificity, and consistent behavior of other miRNA cistron members.

Briefly, 40 mL peripheral blood samples were collected from eight NEN patients, pre- and post-therapy, and five self-reported health controls, and plasma was generated from each sample. Next, 0.1 pmol ath-miR-159a (SEQ ID NO.: 32, UUUGGAUUGAAGGGAGCUCUA) was spiked into 200 \u03bcL of plasma from each patient or control. Cell-free total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit (QIAGEN, cat. No. 217184). RNA was measured using BioRad UV spectrophotometry. cDNA was prepared using TaqMan\u2122 MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 4366596) and 10-20 ng total RNA input. miR-375 and ath-miR-159a real-time PCR was performed using TadMan\u2122 Universal Master Mix II, no UNG (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 4440043) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for miR-375 and spike-in control were generated on StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems\u2122). miR-375 expressions were generated using the delta-Ct method. Seven treated NEN patients (NETs 1, 4, 7, 16, 17, 19, 21) had plasma miR-375 delta Ct values similar to controls (NETs 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). However, one newly diagnosed and untreated patient with small cell lung carcinoma (NET 2) had a low delta Ct value compared to controls, indicating much higher miR-375 plasma concentration. These findings are consistent with miR-375 being a circulating marker of NEN tumor burden, indicating utility as a biomarker for some smoking-related lung cancers.",
