    "abstract": "Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) can be challenging to classify due to subtle histologic differences between pathological types. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that are valuable markers in many neoplastic diseases. To evaluate miRNAs as classificatory markers for lung NENs, we generated comprehensive miRNA expression profiles from 14 typical carcinoid (TC), 15 atypical carcinoid (AC), 11 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and 15 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) samples, through barcoded small RNA sequencing. Following sequence annotation and data preprocessing, we randomly assigned these profiles to discovery and validation sets. Through high expression analyses, we found that miR-21 and -375 are abundant in all lung NENs, and that miR-21/miR-375 expression ratios are significantly lower in carcinoids (TC and AC) than in neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs; SCLC and LCNEC). Subsequently, we ranked and selected miRNAs for use in miRNA-based classification, to discriminate carcinoids from NECs. Using miR-18a and -155 expression, our classifier discriminated these groups in discovery and validation sets, with 93% and 100% accuracy. We also identified miR-17, -103, and -127, and miR-301a, -106b, and -25, as candidate markers for discriminating TC from AC, and SCLC from LCNEC, respectively. However, these promising findings require external validation due to sample size.",

                "Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are variably aggressive tumors that can be challenging to differentiate based on morphological grounds [1,2,3,4,5]. Lung NENs are subdivided into four pathological types, namely typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids are well-differentiated low-grade tumors, with the latter carrying a higher malignant potential. In contrast, LCNEC and SCLC are poorly-differentiated high-grade malignant carcinomas [2,3]. Accurate histologic diagnosis is critical as pathological type conveys prognostic information and guides clinical management [4,6,7,8,9]. Although lung NEN classification has been increasingly refined [2], subtle pathological features can result in sample misclassification [1]. Recently, NEN experts called for further research to aid discrimination of lung NEN pathological types [3,10].",
                "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (19\u201324 nucleotides) RNA molecules that can be used to classify tumor tissues [11]. These regulatory molecules also provide valuable mechanistic insights into tumorigenic processes, through predictable targeting of messenger RNAs [12]. Based on their widespread utility in cancer molecular diagnostics [13], we and others hypothesized that miRNAs could be useful adjunct tissue markers for classifying lung NENs [14,15,16,17,18,19]. Some concerns have been expressed about the variability of miRNA clinical testing [20]; however their stability in fresh and archived tissue [21], in addition to advances in quantitative miRNA detection [22,23], small RNA sequence annotation and genomic organization [24], and machine learning [25] readily support using miRNAs to classify NENs.",
                "Here, we assess miRNA-based classification of lung NENs using a machine learning approach [25]. Through high expression analyses, we identified miRNA tissue markers that are common to all lung NENs. Leveraging prior knowledge that carcinoids (TC and AC) and NECs (SCLC and LCNEC) have major clinical, epidemiologic, histologic, and genetic differences [2], we constructed a classifier that discriminates carcinoids from NECs. We also identified candidate miRNA markers for discriminating TC and AC, as well as SCLC and LCNEC."

Hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue sections from each case were reviewed by experienced pathologists (Paula S. Ginter, Yao-Tseng Chen) using the WHO classification of lung tumors [26]. Slides were reviewed and mitoses were counted using an Olympus microscope, with a 40\u00d7 objective, and with a field diameter of 0.55 in 6 mm2 of viable tumor (25 HPF), and the average mitotic figure per 2 mm2 was calculated [27]. Slides were scanned in a routine manner and areas of highest density staining were located. Using an Olympus microscope, with a 40\u00d7 objective, one author (Paula S. Ginter) manually counted a minimum of 2000 tumor cells to calculate the Ki-67 labeling index [28]. Positive nuclear staining of tumor cells under the microscope was of varying intensity, mostly moderate to strong and some mild, and any staining was considered as positive staining. Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical resection specimen blocks of primary tumor from each case were obtained and randomly assigned to discovery (n = 44) or validation (n = 11) sets prior to the miRNA sequencing below. Sample assignment proportions, to discovery (80%) and validation (20%) sets, are in accordance with standard machine learning practices [29].

However, accurate histologic evaluation can be impacted by sampling issues, uneven distribution of mitoses in tissue sections, misleading artifacts and/or confounding pathologic features, and challenges in identifying punctate necrosis or interpreting transitional cell characteristics [1]. To address the need for further research on lung NEN classification [3], we used our recently established sequence data mining approach to identify miRNA tissue markers that complement histologic evaluation [25].",

When analyzed by pathological type, we noticed that miR-21/-375 expression ratios are useful for discriminating low- and intermediate-grade from high-grade NENs. miR-21 is often upregulated in cancer and thought to be an oncogene [37,38], whereas miR-375 behaves like a tumor suppressor [39]; the regulatory roles of the other abundant individual miRNAs and miRNA cistrons in neuroendocrine tumorigenesis remain to be defined. The ratio of miR-21 and -375 may directly or indirectly reflect the balance of oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities in lung NENs. Despite the classificatory potential of this expression ratio, we found more accurate markers through feature selection below.",

                "miRNAs selected for lung NEN classification also provide interesting pathomechanistic insights. miR-18a and -155 are more highly expressed and discriminate NECs from carcinoids. miR-18a is correlated with lung NEN aggression [17]; miR-155 has been previously identified as a discriminator between NECs and carcinoids [16], and likely reflects the number of hematopoietic cells admixed with the tumor sample [37]. miR-17 and -103 are less expressed and miR-127 more highly expressed in TC than AC, suggesting oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles, respectively. miR-301a, -106b, and -25 are more highly expressed in SCLC than LCNEC; given that both are high-grade tumors, these miRNAs more likely mediate tumor morphology than aggression. Correlation analyses suggest miR-18a, -155 -17, -127, -106b, and -25 are related to Ki-67 expression and mitotic rate; differential expression analyses suggest they may also be related to necrosis, however we were unable to validate these findings due to low sample size. As these pathologic parameters are all significantly different in TC, AC, SCLC, and LCNEC, further investigation is required to elucidate the functional roles of these miRNAs.",
                "Our current study has similar limitations to our published study on miRNA-based gastroenteropancreatic NEN classification [25]. Assembling large collections of rare tumor samples is challenging, functional imaging and pathologic data are often not linked, assessing the prognostic value of candidate miRNA markers may not be possible due to uneven clinical follow-up, and comparing results between studies can be challenging due to inherent differences between miRNA detection methodologies [13]. Nonetheless, we continue to build knowledge of miRNA expression in NENs that can be leveraged by clinical and basic investigators.",
                "We have developed and validated a miRNA-based classifier for discriminating carcinoids from NECs, provided candidate miRNA markers for differentiating pathological types, shown potential for identifying aggressive AC cases through miRNA expression ratios, and provided comprehensive reference miRNA profiles to stimulate further investigation. Our research directions include additional miRNA profiling of well annotated lung NEN sample collections, and functional characterization of selected miRNAs in neuroendocrine tumorigenesis."

                "Combined molecular and machine learning methods have much promise for accurate tumor classification. Using a representative approach, we have developed, and internally validated, a simple miRNA-based classifier, comprising miR-18a and -155, to discriminate low-grade carcinoids from high-grade NECs, with a high degree (>90%) of accuracy. We have also identified miR-17, -103, and -127 as candidate markers to discriminate TC from AC, and miR-301a, -106b, and -25, as candidates to discriminate SCLC from LCNEC. To fully explore the clinical utility of these markers, future studies should incorporate larger numbers of well-annotated clinical samples."
