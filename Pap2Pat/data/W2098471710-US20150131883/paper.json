    "title": "Joint estimation of tissue types and linear attenuation coefficients for photon counting CT",
    "date": "2015-08-18",
    "abstract": "Newly developed spectral computed tomography (CT) such as photon counting detector CT enables more accurate tissue-type identification through material decomposition technique. Many iterative reconstruction methods, including those developed for spectral CT, however, employ a regularization term whose penalty transition is designed using pixel value of CT image itself. Similarly, the tissue-type identification methods are then applied after reconstruction; thus, it is impossible to take into account probability distribution obtained from projection likelihood. The purpose of this work is to develop comprehensive image reconstruction and tissue-type identification algorithm which improves quality of both reconstructed image and tissue-type map.The authors propose a new framework to jointly perform image reconstruction, material decomposition, and tissue-type identification for photon counting detector CT by applying maximum a posteriori estimation with voxel-based latent variables for the tissue types. The latent variables are treated using a voxel-based coupled Markov random field to describe the continuity and discontinuity of human organs and a set of Gaussian distributions to incorporate the statistical relation between the tissue types and their attenuation characteristics. The performance of the proposed method is quantitatively compared to that of filtered backprojection and a quadratic penalized likelihood method by 100 noise realization.Results showed a superior trade-off between image noise and resolution to current reconstruction methods. The standard deviation (SD) and bias of reconstructed image were improved from quadratic penalized likelihood method: bias, -0.9 vs -0.1 Hounsfield unit (HU); SD, 46.8 vs 27.4 HU. The accuracy of tissue-type identification was also improved from quadratic penalized likelihood method: 80.1% vs 86.9%.The proposed method makes it possible not only to identify tissue types more accurately but also to reconstruct CT images with decreased noise and enhanced sharpness owing to the information about the tissue types.",

                "Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most important medical imaging tools, thanks to its high contrast resolution and short scan durations. Recent improvements in detector technology made it possible to develop energy-resolved photon counting detector (PCD)-based CT, which is expected to provide various clinical benefits such as enhanced tissue contrast, decreased image noise, decreased radiation dose to patient, quantitative monoenergetic CT images, and more accurate material decomposition. 1 PCD-CT counts the number of x-ray photons transmitted through an attenuator with two or more energy windows using an energy-resolved semiconductor detector such as CZT or CdTe and allows using multiple basis functions in material decomposition. 2 For example, a linear combination of three basis functions-e.g., photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and the discontinuity at the K-edge of a contrast agent-can accurately model the energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficient of any material typically involved in clinical imaging routine, except for metallic implants. 3 The coefficients of basis functions, which we call characteristic coefficients in this paper, are functions of the chemical composition and the mass density of the attenuator. They are unique for typical biological compounds such as adipose, heart muscle, liver parenchyma, lung, rib, spine, and iodine-enhanced blood. 4 Therefore, energy-resolved PCD-CT has the potential to perform tissue-type identification more accurately using the characteristic coefficients and allowing software to separate blood vessels from bones, quantify the fat mass, etc.",
                "A variety of methods have been proposed to reconstruct the projection data in energy-resolved CT. [5][6][7][8] As in the case of conventional x-ray CT, iterative reconstruction methods have improved the trade-off between the spatial resolution and the noise in the reconstructed images compared to analytic filtered backprojection (FBP) methods. Many iterative methods are a variation of the penalized maximum likelihood (PML) method. While the likelihood term of these methods is based on the statistical properties of the measured data, the regularization (or prior) term is empirical and is often not optimal. For example, the transition point for the Huber prior between the quadratic and the linear penalty term is defined without exact knowledge of the tissue type to which the pixel of interest belongs, 9 and the same parameters are applied to all pixels regardless of their true tissue type.",
                "We hypothesize that a more accurate regularization can be performed with the knowledge of the tissue types and organ boundaries, and consequently, the image quality can be improved. The values of the linear attenuation coefficients for neighboring image pixels are expected to vary smoothly and continuously when they belong to the same tissue. In contrast, the values are usually discontinuous at the organ boundaries. Moreover, the typical values of the chemical composition and mass density of various human tissue types or organs are provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), from which expected values of linear attenuation coefficients can be calculated.",
                "We propose a novel image reconstruction method, denoted \"joint estimation maximum a posteriori\" (JE-MAP), which jointly estimates images of the energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficients and tissue types from PCD data using material decomposition. The method implements image reconstruction using prior information about tissue types as well as tissue-type identification using information of the noise distribution during CT projection. The JE-MAP algorithm employs maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation based on voxel-based latent variables for the tissue types. 10 The geometrical and statistical information about human organs is incorporated as prior information using a voxelbased coupled Markov random field (MRF) model and a Gaussian mixture model, respectively. 11,12 We performed computer simulations to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to FBP and PML methods with a quadratic penalty."

JE-MAP reconstructed CT images with much less noise (\u03c3 = 27.4 HU), while the boundaries of organs remained sharp (Fig. 5) resulting in more accurate tissue-type identification at the boundaries. There are some regions in the tissue images of PML and JE-MAP where muscle and liver tissues were mislabeled because the characteristic coefficients of muscle and liver are too close to each other to be separated [see Fig. 2(e)].",
                "The calculation of JE-MAP took 942.59 s for 33 iterations, while PML took 867.35 s for 33 iterations, using single Intel \u00ae Xeon \u00ae CPU E5-2643 v3 @ 3.40 GHz. Note that the present program codes have not been optimized in any way in the simulation.",
                "Figure 6 presents JE-MAP images when one of the four parameters was smaller than the default setting used in Fig. 4, and Fig. 7 shows the images with larger parameters. The use of a smaller \u03b2 1 made the images heterogeneous but noisy [Figs. 6(a Figure 8 shows the bias and standard deviation of the CT images at 70 keV, and the accuracy of the tissue-type identification. The mean values were measured for each organ excluding pixels near the boundaries of organs and are presented together with the mean values of the entire phantom in Tables III-V. It can be seen that JE-MAP provided the best values in most indexes. The bias was as small as -0.1 HU with JE-MAP. The image noise of the entire phantom (Table IV) was 46.8 HU for FBP, 38.5 HU for PML, and 27.4 HU for JE-MAP. The accuracy of tissue types improved from 71.7% for FBP and 80.1% for PML to 86.9% for JE-MAP. The low accuracy of muscle with JE-MAP was attributed to the mislabeling as liver. The resolution-noise trade-off curves were shown in Fig. 9, where the top-left end-point of the curves was obtained from the images reconstructed by the corresponding method. JE-MAP provided the best trade-off performance."

            "paragraphs": [
                "We proposed a new framework, JE-MAP, to jointly perform image reconstruction, material decomposition, and tissuetype identification for photon counting x-ray CT. The results from 100 noise realizations showed that JE-MAP provided superior bias, standard deviation in homogeneous tissue regions (Tables III-V) to PML with quadratic penalty and FBP. However, JE-MAP showed larger standard deviation on the boundaries of tissues [Fig. 8(f)] which is usually observed in the PML method with edge-preserving penalty as well. The results from Fig. 9 showed that JE-MAP provided superior noise-resolution trade-off for the CT images to PML with quadratic penalty and FBP. This is because JE-MAP does not penalize differences between adjacent pixels at organ boundaries, while PML with quadratic penalty encourages smoothness even at edges. These results also indicate that the large standard deviation on the boundaries is caused not because JE-MAP blurs the boundaries but because the location of tissue boundaries varies for each noise realization while the edge is indeed maintained sharp as reported in Ref. 22.",
                "A PML with edge-preserving penalty could perform better than that with quadratic penalty, and a comparison with JE-MAP would be of interest. We shall leave this for future study. However, we believe that JE-MAP has a greater potential than PML, because an edge-preserving penalty such as the Huber penalty 9 changes the strength of the penalty based on differences in pixel values, which are affected by image noise. It is a challenge to robustly suppress noise effectively while maintaining the true differences in adjacent pixel values. In contrast, JE-MAP obtains the information if the adjacent pixels are located at an organ boundary or inside an organ, and will change the strength of the penalty [see Eq. ( 13)]. We believe that this is a conceptual difference in the algorithm design. Moreover, JE-MAP could use more prior information about tissues in the human body via additional latent variables such as the location, the size, and the number of pixel groups with the same tissue type.",
                "The accuracy of the tissue-type identification improved as well for JE-MAP compared to PML and FBP. While the tissue-type images based on FBP and PML images showed an isolated salt-and-pepper noise pattern, JE-MAP provided pixels with the same tissue type grouped together to form \"islands.\" This is because JE-MAP honors the statistical relationship between the characteristic coefficients and the tissue types and those between neighboring pixels. Another advantage of JE-MAP is that the tissue-type identification is based on the projection likelihood rather than on information from image voxels. This means that JE-MAP can perform identification by placing more weight on the prior information if the reconstructed characteristic coefficients are not accurate due to large noise in the projection data. However, the current prior in JE-MAP cannot differentiate the tissue types whose characteristic coefficients are too close to each other or even overlapped. To differentiate them correctly, we will need to use prior information about the presence of tissue types such as the statistical atlas, which models the probability map of tissue types in human body. In the future work, the use of the evaluation metric that can be accounted for the similarities of the tissue types would be desirable.",
                "A potential problem of JE-MAP with the current parameter setting is that it might suppress heterogeneous textures inside organs [Fig. 8(c)] or introduce a bias. We think this behavior can be attributed to suboptimal parameters such as \u03b2 larger \u03b2 4 decreases the image noise as can be seen in Fig. 7(f), but at the expense of heterogeneous texture and bias. This discussion leads to another point: How to optimize several parameters of JE-MAP?",
                "In this paper, we focused on finding a reasonable parameter to study the effect of the parameter values on the image quality. The question how to optimize the parameters remains a challenge, just like for other algorithms with multiple parameters. We envision that it would require both repeating the same procedures for various cases and using information theory to automatically weigh and balance the effect of each term and parameter. We shall leave this for future work as well.",
                "The limitation of the current JE-MAP method is that it assumes that there exists only one tissue type in each voxel.  Two cases that would violate this assumption are the partial volume at organ boundaries and contrast-enhanced soft tissues. In the future work, we plan to address the issue while maintaining the framework of JE-MAP method. The partial volume problem at organ boundaries will be solved or mitigated by using finer voxels at boundaries. The contrast agent could be modeled by using a third basis function in material decomposition, which describes the attenuation coefficient of the contrast agent, although it could be challenging when the attenuation is large. In Ref. 23, the authors proposed a method similar to JE-MAP for dual-energy CT, which could potentially solve the partial volume problem. They assumed that each voxel contained at most three out of several possible tissue types and estimated the three tissue types and their volume fractions for each voxel using volume conservation as a constraint. A penalized-likelihood method with edge-preserving penalty for each material was used. The strength of this method is that by design, the tissue-mixture is modeled at any voxels. The weakness of the method is that the linear attenuation coefficient of each tissue type is deterministic and deviations from the expected value are modeled only by mixing other tissue types. In addition, similar to the problem with the conventional edge-preserving penalty discussed above, the penalty changes its strength based on differences in the volume fractions of each tissue type between adjacent voxels. Unlike JE-MAP, the change of (or the lack thereof) tissue types is not used to change the penalty strength.",
                "As the number of tissue types in the object increases, the optimization of the cost function becomes more difficult in terms of calculation cost and increase of local minima. To deal with these optimization problems, we plan to perform a graded tissue-type identification, namely, we perform the identification along a preliminary defined tree structure where tissue type are categorized depending on their components' similarity. We may also need to perform image reconstruction and tissue-type identification alternatively in order to utilize more sophisticated image segmentation algorithm such as Graph Cut. 24 These improvements in optimization algorithm enable JE-MAP to find minima closer to global minimum with less calculation time, thus more reliably enhanced CT images and tissue-type distribution can be obtained.",
                "In terms of the experimental setup, we need to further perform studies with different dose levels and different phantoms. For comparison, we need to perform reconstructions with other PML algorithms such as the Huber penalty as well as tissue-type identification with other MRF-based image segmentation algorithms, and evaluate them with other criteria such as the noise power spectrum or noise correlation in the image domain. We also need to change geometries from simple parallel beam to fan beam or cone beam. F\uf769\uf767. 9. Noise-resolution trade-off curves. The top-left point of each method is the values from the estimated images, and the curves are obtained by blurring each image with a Gaussian filter with various parameters.",
                "We used the NIST database to calculate the expected value of human tissue types. However, these are just literature values and they may be quite different from the actual values in a particular patient. We will need to revisit our statistical relationship prior model parameters once we have better understanding and data of the distribution of each tissue's characteristic coefficients. After the implementation of PCD-CT in clinics, we plan to perform evaluations using real images, and collect distributions of characteristic coefficients for various tissue types. We will need to change our statistical relationship prior model depending on the shape of distribution of each tissue's characteristic coefficients.",
                "At the present stage, we need to set all the tissue types which can possibly appear in the slices. However, we assume the number of tissue types does not become drastically large, if an appropriate tissue type database to be used can be chosen based on the location and protocol of scan. Moreover, using too many candidate tissue types with similar characteristic coefficients may introduce errors in tissue identifications as seen in our simulation result. Theoretically, such an error will lead to a wrong choice of priors, resulting in unexpected artifact, although it was not observed in our simulation. Thus, we will need to keep the number of tissue-type classes small and manageable by putting similar tissue types into one class if necessary, for example, in the simulation, putting muscle and liver tissue types into a class called \"soft tissue.\"",
                "The approach of JE-MAP method-estimating characteristic coefficients and tissue types jointly-can be applied to dual-energy CT by adjusting the data likelihood model. Furthermore, it can be applied to current single-energy CT by changing the variables from the characteristic coefficients to x-ray attenuation coefficients. We plan to develop JE-MAP methods for dual-energy CT and singleenergy CT and evaluate the performances using actual patient data.",
                "Other future challenges of this study are as follows. First, as discussed above, we plan to improve a prior for tissue type and characteristic coefficients including the shape and size of organs, similar to statistical atlas, in order to identify tissue types more correctly. Second, we need to allow for multiple tissue types at a voxel to deal with partial volume effect at organ boundaries and iodine perfusion to tissues such as liver and kidney. Third, we need to include PCD degradation factors to the algorithm. This can be done in a straightforward fashion as long as the likelihood can be approximated as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.",
