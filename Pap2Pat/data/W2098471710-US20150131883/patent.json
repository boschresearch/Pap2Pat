    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a new joint estimation framework employing MAP estimation based on pixel-based latent variables for tissue types. The method combines the geometrical information described by latent MRF, statistical relation between tissue types and P-C coefficients, and Poisson noise models of PCD data, and makes possible the continuous Baysian estimation from detected photon counts. The proposed method has better accuracy and RMSE than the method using FBP and thresholding. The joint estimation framework has the potential to further improve the accuracy by introducing more information about tissues in human body, e.g., the location, size, and number of tissues, or limited variation of neighboring tissues, which will be easily formulated by pixel-based latent variables.",

Tissue types such as bones, fat, muscle, and iodine-enhanced blood can then be identified, allowing software applications to, e.g., separate blood vessels from bones, quantify the fat mass, etc.",

Second, images of linear attenuation coefficients and tissue types are estimated from w.",

                                "The present invention is directed to a new framework, JE-MAP, to jointly perform image reconstruction, material decomposition, and tissue type identification for photon-counting x-ray CT. The results showed that JE-MAP provided superior noise-resolution tradeoff for the CT images (FIG. 10) than PML with quadratic penalty and FBP. This is because JE-MAP does not penalize differences between adjacent pixels at organ boundaries, while PML with quadratic penalty encourages smoothness even at edges. A PML with edge-preserving penalty could perform better than that with quadratic penalty, and a comparison with JE-MAP would be of interest. However, JE-MAP has a greater potential than PML, because an edge-preserving penalty such as the Huber penalty changes the strength of the penalty based on differences in pixel values, which are affected by image noise. Moreover, JE-MAP could use more prior information about tissues in the human body via additional latent variables such as the location, the size, and the number of pixel groups with the same tissue type.",
                                "The accuracy of the tissue type identification improved as well for JE-MAP compared to PML and FBP. While the tissue type images based on FBP and PML images showed an isolated salt-and-pepper noise pattern, JE-MAP provided pixels with the same tissue type grouped together to form \u2018islands.\u2019 This is because JE-MAP honors the statistical relation between the characteristic coefficients and the tissue types and those between neighboring pixels. Another advantage of JE-MAP is that the tissue-type identification is based on the projection likelihood rather than on information from image voxels. This means that JE-MAP can perform identification by placing more weight on the prior information if the reconstructed characteristic coefficients are not accurate due to large noise in the projection data.",
                                "A potential problem of JE-MAP with the current parameter setting is that it might suppress heterogeneous textures inside organs (FIG. 9C) or introduce a bias. This behavior can be attributed to suboptimal parameters such as \u03b24. A larger \u03b24 decreases the image noise as can be seen in FIG. 8F, but at the expense of heterogeneous texture and bias."
