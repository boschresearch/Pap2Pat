# DESCRIPTION

This invention relates to compounds. More specifically, the invention relates to compounds useful as lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) family members (LOXL1, LOXL2, LOXL3, LOXL4) inhibitors, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to the compounds for use in the treatment of conditions mediated by LOX and LOXL, for example cancer; to a LOX inhibitor for use in the treatment of a cancer associated with EGFR and to biomarkers that predict responsiveness to a LOX inhibitor.

## BACKGROUND

LOX (protein-6-lysine-oxidase; EC 1.4.3.13) is an extracellular enzyme that catalyses oxidative deamination of the primary amines of lysine and hydroxylysine in proteins such as collagen and tropoelastin to generate peptidyl-[a]-aminoadipic-[8]-semialdehyde, an aldehyde that spontaneously condenses to form inter- and intra-chain cross-links (Lucero and Kagan 2006). LOX regulates maturation of proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby contributing to ECM tensile strength and function and so playing an important role in connective tissue remodelling. Other proteins have been reported as substrates for oxidation by LOX, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, PDGFR-13 and other cationic proteins (Kagan and Li 2003, Li, Nugent et al. 2003, Lucero and Kagan 2006, Lucero, Ravid et al. 2008).

LOX is secreted as a precursor protein that is proteolytically processed by procollagen C-proteinases (bone morphogenetic protein 1—BMP-1) and mammalian tolloid-like protein (mTLL-1) (Uzel, Scott et al. 2001) to generate an 18 kDa pro-peptide and the 32 kDa active LOX enzyme (Lucero and Kagan 2006). The catalytic domain contains copper and a lysine-tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor. LTQ is formed by post-translational oxidation of a catalytic site tyrosine (Tyr349), which then condenses onto a lysine, also within the catalytic site (Lys314), to form a stable covalent modification that is an essential part of the catalytic mechanism (Lucero and Kagan 2006) (Kagan and Li 2003).

LOX is part of a protein family consisting of five paralogues, LOX, LOX-like 1 [LOXL1], LOX-like 2 [LOXL2], LOX-like 3 [LOXL3] and LOX-like 4 [LOXL4]), all containing a conserved catalytic region. LOX enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining ECM stability, by initiating and regulating the crosslinking of collagens and elastin within the extracellular matrix (ECM). The activity of these enzymes is key to maintaining the normal tensile and elastic features of connective tissue of many organ systems within the body. LOX expression decreases during ageing indicating that its activity is especially important during development.

In addition to its role in tissue remodelling, LOX also plays a critical role in primary cancer and metastasis. Studies have shown that LOX plays a fundamental role in the growth of primary tumours in colorectal and lung cancer (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010, Baker, Cox et al. 2011) and glioblastoma (Mammoto, Jiang et al. 2013).

Expression of LOX is elevated in more than 70% of breast cancer patients with Estrogen Receptor negative disease, in 80% of head & neck cancer patients, in 33% of primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and 48% of metastatic tissues from patients with CRC (Baker, Cox et al. 2011), and in cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with a history of alcoholism (Huang, Ho et al. 2013). As discussed in more detail in the description, LOX is also overexpressed in numerous other cancers including lung, prostate and pancreatic cancers.

Elevated LOX expression is also associated with metastasis and decreased patient survival (Baker, Cox et al. 2011, Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011)

Other members of the LOX family have been implicated in proliferative diseases such as cancer. LOXL2 is another member of the LOX family that is involved in the cross-linking of extracellular collagens and elastin (Vadasz, Kessler et al. 2005) (Kim, Kim et al. 2010). In addition to conserved C-terminal region, the LOXL2 protein has scavenger receptor cysteine-rich regions that are commonly found in cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as a cytokine receptor-like domain.

LOXL2 expression has been found upregulated in breast, gastric, colon, esophageal, head and neck, lung and laryngeal carcinomas, as reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012) and in renal cells carcinoma (Hase, Jingushi et al. 2014) (Nishikawa, Chiyomaru et al. 2015).

Studies have suggested that LOX and LOXL2 do not compensate one another, as manipulation of LOX expression did not affect LOXL2 levels in a colorectal cancer model (Baker, Cox et al. 2011). Thus while LOX and LOXL2 are involved in similar extra-cellular processes, it appears that they have distinct roles.

LOXL1 was found to be overexpressed in metastatic non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC), and the metastatic phenotype can be reduced by inhibition with LOXL1 siRNA (Lee, Kim et al. 2011).

LOXL3 mRNA was expressed in Hs578T highly invasive breast cancer cells, but not in poorly invasive and non-metastatic breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002). Overexpression of LOXL3 in MDCK epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is a key step in the progression of metastasis (Peinado, Del Carmen Iglesias-de la Cruz et al. 2005).

In a study on the mRNA levels of LOXL4 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, high expression of LOXL4 gene was detected in 71% of all carcinomas and only in 9% of the healthy mucosa samples, indicating that LOXL4 may serve as a selective molecular marker in primary and metastatic head and neck carcinoma (Scola and Gorogh 2010). Up-regulation of LOXL4 was demonstrated in invasive HNC and revealed a significant correlation between LOXL4 expression and local lymph node metastases and higher tumour stages (Goeroegh, Weise et al. 2007). LOXL4 promotes metastasis in gastric cancer (Li, Zhao et al. 2015). LOXL4 together with LOXL2 has been found to be required for metastatic niche formation in a breast orthotopic mouse model (Wong, Gilkes et al. 2011).

LOX and LOXL are implicated in fibrotic diseases, such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, myelofibrosis and schleroderma. Both LOX and LOXL are highly expressed in fibrotic areas, in surrounding myofibroblasts and in serum of patients with fibrotic conditions (Kagan 1994) (Kim, Peyrol et al. 1999) (Siegel, Chen et al. 1978) (Jourdan-Le Saux, Gleyzal et al. 1994) (Murawaki, Kusakabe et al. 1991).

LOX is also implicated in cardiovascular disease. As discussed in the detailed description of the invention, LOX inhibition may prove beneficial in the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertensive heart disease, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis.

LOX is associated with the amyloid-beta (Aβ) related pathological hallmarks (such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and senile plaques) of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) pathogenesis (Wilhelmus, Bol et al. 2013). LOX activity is increased in the hippocampal samples of Alzheimer's disease and also in non-Alzheimer's dementia (Gilad, Kagan et al. 2005). LOX is increased at the site of brain injury (Gilad, Kagan et al. 2001) and spinal cord injury and its inhibition lead to accelerated functional recovery in an unilateral spinal cord dissection model (Gilad and Gilad 2001).

LOXLs are implicated in pulmonary diseases. LOXL2 and LOXL3 are likely to have a role in Primary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) since both are expressed in PAP tissue, but not normal lung tissue (Neufeld and Brekhman 2009).

LOX inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of various ocular conditions. Inhibition of LOX or LOXL2 prevents neovascularization and fibrosis following laser-induced chloroidal neovascularization (CNV). Therefore LOX and LOXL inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of conditions characterized by neovascularization, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (Stalmans, Marshall et al. 2010).

LOX is implicated in inflammatory conditions and may be useful in the treatment of conditions including, but not limited to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Mambetsariev, Tian et al. 2014).

LOX is the main isoenzyme expressed in human adipose tissue and that its expression is strongly upregulated in samples from obese patients. β-aminopropionitrile reduces body weight gain and improves the metabolic profile in diet-induced obesity in rats (Miana, Galan et al. 2015) and reduces local adipose tissue inflammation (Halberg, Khan et al. 2009).

LOX is upregulated in endometriosis and may be implicated in the establishment and progression of endometriotic lesions (Ruiz, Dutil et al. 2011) (Dentillo, Meola et al. 2010).

Certain LOX inhibitors are known. These include β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), haloamines, 1,2-diamines, ally) and propargyl amines, hydrazines, semicarbazide and thiolactones, benzylamines, mercaptopyridine and pyridazinone compounds (Pinnell and Martin 1968) (Tang, Simpson et al. 1984) (Palfreyman, McDonald et al. 1989) (Sayre 2007) (Carrington, Bird et al. 1984) (Levene, Sharman et al. 1992) (Liu, Nellaiappan et al. 1997) (Williamson and Kagan 1987) (Anderson, Bartlett et al. 2007) (Schohe-Loop, Burchardt et al. 2003) (Burchardt 2006, Aslam, Miele et al. 2015). However, in general these compounds are either non-selective, lack potency or are unsuitable for use in patients. It is believed that the only LOX inhibitor which has progressed to clinical trials in humans is BAPN. However, it is believed that this compound has not been used clinically since 1978. More recent LOX and LOXL2 inhibitors have been described: LOX inhibitors containing hydrazine and hydrazide groups (Burke et al, 2017); LOXL2 inhibitors: derivatives of haloallylamine (Chang et al, 2017), pyridines (Rowbottom et al, 2016a; Rowbottom et al, 2016b), pyrimidines (Rowbottom & Hutchinson, 2017a) and chromenones (Rowbottom & Hutchinson, 2017b).

There is therefore a need for new LOX inhibitors.

Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification and claims have the following meanings set out below.

It is to be appreciated that references to “treating” or “treatment” include prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms of a condition. “Treating” or “treatment” of a state, disorder or condition therefore includes: (1) preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition developing in a human that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition, (2) inhibiting the state, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting, reducing or delaying the development of the disease or a relapse thereof (in case of maintenance treatment) or at least one clinical or subclinical symptom thereof, or (3) relieving or attenuating the disease, i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or at least one of its clinical or subclinical symptoms.

A “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The “therapeutically effective amount” will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.

The term “halo” or “halogen” refers to one of the halogens, group 17 of the periodic table. In particular the term refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Preferably, the term refers to fluorine or chlorine.

The term Cm-n refers to a group with m to n carbon atoms.

The term “C1-6 alkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon chain containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl. “C1-4 alkyl” similarly refers to such groups containing up to 4 carbon atoms. Alkylene groups are divalent alkyl groups and may likewise be linear or branched and have two points of attachment to the remainder of the molecule. Furthermore, an alkylene group may, for example, correspond to one of those alkyl groups listed in this paragraph. The alkyl and alkylene groups may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Possible substituents are described below. Substituents for the alkyl group may be halogen, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, OH, C1-C4alkoxy. Other substituents for the alkyl group may alternatively be used.

The term “C1-6 haloalkyl”, e.g. “C1-4 haloalkyl”, refers to a hydrocarbon chain substituted with at least one halogen atom independently chosen at each occurrence, for example fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The halogen atom may be present at any position on the hydrocarbon chain. For example, C1-6 haloalkyl may refer to chloromethyl, fluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloroethyl e.g. 1-chloromethyl and 2-chloroethyl, trichloroethyl e.g. 1,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, fluoroethyl e.g. 1-fluoromethyl and 2-fluoroethyl, trifluoroethyl e.g. 1,2,2-trifluoroethyl and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, chloropropyl, trichloropropyl, fluoropropyl, trifluoropropyl.

The term “C2-6 alkenyl” includes a branched or linear hydrocarbon chain containing at least one double bond and having 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. The double bond(s) may be present as the E or Z isomer. The double bond may be at any possible position of the hydrocarbon chain. For example, the “C2-6 alkenyl” may be ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, butadienyl, pentenyl, pentadienyl, hexenyl and hexadienyl.

The term “C2-6 alkynyl” includes a branched or linear hydrocarbon chain containing at least one triple bond and having 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. The triple bond may be at any possible position of the hydrocarbon chain. For example, the “C2-6 alkynyl” may be ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl.

The term “C3-6 cycloalkyl” includes a saturated hydrocarbon ring system containing 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. For example, the “C3-C6 cycloalkyl” may be cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, bicycle[2.1.1]hexane or bicycle[1.1.1]pentane.

The term “heterocyclyl”, “heterocyclic” or “heterocycle” includes a non-aromatic saturated or partially saturated monocyclic or fused, bridged, or spiro bicyclic heterocyclic ring system(s). Monocyclic heterocyclic rings may contain from about 3 to 12 (suitably from 3 to 7) ring atoms, with from 1 to 5 (suitably 1, 2 or 3) heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the ring. Bicyclic heterocycles may contain from 7 to 17 member atoms, suitably 7 to 12 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocyclic(s) rings may be fused, spiro, or bridged ring systems. Examples of heterocyclic groups include cyclic ethers such as oxiranyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, dioxanyl, and substituted cyclic ethers. Heterocycles comprising at least one nitrogen in a ring position include, for example, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, tetrahydrotriazinyl, tetrahydropyrazolyl, tetrahydropyridinyl, homopiperidinyl, homopiperazinyl, 3,8-diaza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl, 8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl, 2,5-Diaza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl and the like. Typical sulfur containing heterocycles include tetrahydrothienyl, dihydro-1,3-dithiol, tetrahydro-2H-thiopyran, and hexahydrothiepine.

For heterocycles containing sulfur, the oxidized sulfur heterocycles containing SO or SO2 groups are also included. Examples include the sulfoxide and sulfone forms of tetrahydrothienyl and thiomorpholinyl such as tetrahydrothiene 1,1-dioxide and thiomorpholinyl 1,1-dioxide. A suitable value for a heterocyclyl group which bears 1 or 2 oxo (═O), for example, 2 oxopyrrolidinyl, 2-oxoimidazolidinyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, 2,5-dioxopyrrolidinyl, 2,5-dioxoimidazolidinyl or 2,6-dioxopiperidinyl. Particular heterocyclyl groups are saturated monocyclic 3 to 7 membered heterocyclyls containing 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, for example azetidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrothienyl, tetrahydrothienyl 1,1-dioxide, thiomorpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl 1,1-dioxide, piperidinyl, homopiperidinyl, piperazinyl or homopiperazinyl. As the skilled person would appreciate, any heterocycle may be linked to another group via any suitable atom, such as via a carbon or nitrogen atom. For example, the term “piperidino” or “morpholino” refers to a piperidin-1-yl or morpholin-4-yl ring that is linked via the ring nitrogen.

The term “bridged ring systems” includes ring systems in which two rings share more than two atoms, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages 131-133, 1992. Examples of bridged heterocyclyl ring systems include, aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 2-oxa-5-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, and quinuclidine.

The term “spiro bi-cyclic ring systems” includes ring systems in which two ring systems share one common spiro carbon atom, i.e. the heterocyclic ring is linked to a further carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring through a single common spiro carbon atom. Examples of spiro ring systems include 3,8-diaza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, 2,5-Diaza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 6-azaspiro[3.4]octane, 2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.4]octane, 2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane, 2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptane, 6-oxa-2-azaspiro[3.4]octane, 2,7-diaza-spiro[4.4]nonane, 2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane, 2-oxa-7-azaspiro[3.5]nonane and 2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.5]nonane.

“Heterocyclyl-Cm-n alkyl” includes a heterocyclyl group covalently attached to a Cm-n alkylene group, both of which are defined herein.

The term “aromatic” when applied to a substituent as a whole includes a single ring or polycyclic ring system with 4n+2 electrons in a conjugated n system within the ring or ring system where all atoms contributing to the conjugated n system are in the same plane.

The term “aryl” includes an aromatic hydrocarbon ring system. The ring system has 4n+2 electrons in a conjugated n system within a ring where all atoms contributing to the conjugated n system are in the same plane. For example, the “aryl” may be phenyl and naphthyl. The aryl system itself may be substituted with other groups.

The term “heteroaryl” includes an aromatic mono- or bicyclic ring incorporating one or more (for example 1-4, particularly 1, 2 or 3) heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. The ring or ring system has 4n+2 electrons in a conjugated n system where all atoms contributing to the conjugated n system are in the same plane.

Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic ring or a 9- or 10-membered bicyclic ring, for example a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Typically the heteroaryl ring will contain up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five.

Examples of heteroaryl include fury, pyrrolyl, thienyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazenyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzothienyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, indazolyl, purinyl, benzofurazanyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, pteridinyl, naphthyridinyl, carbazolyl, phenazinyl, benzisoquinolinyl, pyridopyrazinyl, thieno[2,3-b]furanyl, 2H-furo[3,2-b]-pyranyl, 5H-pyrido[2,3-d]-o-oxazinyl, 1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]-oxazolyl, 4H-imidazo[4,5-d]thiazolyl, pyrazino[2,3-d]pyridazinyl, imidazo[2,1-b]thiazolyl and imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4]triazinyl. Examples of heteroaryl groups comprising at least one nitrogen in a ring position include pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazenyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, indazolyl, purinyl, benzofurazanyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl and pteridinyl. “Heteroaryl” also covers partially aromatic bi- or polycyclic ring systems wherein at least one ring is an aromatic ring and one or more of the other ring(s) is a non-aromatic, saturated or partially saturated ring, provided at least one ring contains one or more heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Examples of partially aromatic heteroaryl groups include for example, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, 2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, dihydrobenzthienyl, dihydrobenzfuranyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxinyl, benzo[1,3]dioxolyl, 2,2-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzothienyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuranyl, indolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazinyl and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazinyl.

“Heteroaryl-Cm-n alkyl-” includes a heteroaryl group covalently attached to a Cm-n alkylene group, both of which are defined herein. Examples of heteroaralkyl groups include pyridin-3-ylmethyl and the like.

The term “optionally substituted” includes either groups, structures, or molecules that are substituted and those that are not substituted.

Where optional substituents are chosen from “one or more” groups it is to be understood that this definition includes all substituents being chosen from one of the specified groups or the substituents being chosen from two or more of the specified groups.

The phrase “compound of the invention” means those compounds which are disclosed herein, both generically and specifically.

A bond terminating in a “” represents that the bond is connected to another atom that is not shown in the structure. A bond terminating inside a cyclic structure and not terminating at an atom of the ring structure represents that the bond may be connected to any of the atoms in the ring structure where allowed by valency.

Where a moiety is substituted, it may be substituted at any point on the moiety where chemically possible and consistent with atomic valency requirements. The moiety may be substituted by one or more substituents, e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents; optionally there are 1 or 2 substituents on a group. Where there are two or more substituents, the substituents may be the same or different.

Substituents are only present at positions where they are chemically possible, the person skilled in the art being able to decide (either experimentally or theoretically) without undue effort which substitutions are chemically possible and which are not.

Ortho, meta and para substitution are well understood terms in the art. For the absence of doubt, “ortho” substitution is a substitution pattern where adjacent carbons possess a substituent, whether a simple group, for example the fluoro group in the example below, or other portions of the molecule, as indicated by the bond ending in “”.

“Meta” substitution is a substitution pattern where two substituents are on carbons one carbon removed from each other, i.e. with a single carbon atom between the substituted carbons. In other words there is a substituent on the second atom away from the atom with another substituent. For example the groups below are meta substituted.

“Para” substitution is a substitution pattern where two substituents are on carbons two carbons removed from each other, i.e. with two carbon atoms between the substituted carbons. In other words there is a substituent on the third atom away from the atom with another substituent. For example the groups below are para substituted.

The term “acyl” includes an organic radical derived from, for example, an organic acid by the removal of the hydroxyl group, e.g. a radical having the formula R—C(O)—, where R may be selected from H, C1-6 alkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl or phenethyl group, e.g. R is H or C1-3 alkyl. In one embodiment acyl is alkyl-carbonyl. Examples of acyl groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, propionyl and butyryl. A particular acyl group is acetyl (also represented as Ac).

Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words “comprise” and “contain” and variations of them mean “including but not limited to”, and they are not intended to (and do not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps. Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural unless the context otherwise requires. In particular, where the indefinite article is used, the specification is to be understood as contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the context requires otherwise.

Features, integers, characteristics, compounds, chemical moieties or groups described in conjunction with a particular aspect, embodiment or example of the invention are to be understood to be applicable to any other aspect, embodiment or example described herein unless incompatible therewith. All of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive. The invention is not restricted to the details of any foregoing embodiments. The invention extends to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), or to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the steps of any method or process so disclosed.

The reader's attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference.

The various functional groups and substituents making up the compounds of the present invention are typically chosen such that the molecular weight of the compound does not exceed 1000. More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less.

Suitable or preferred features of any compounds of the present invention may also be suitable features of any other aspect.

The invention contemplates pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention. These may include the acid addition and base salts of the compounds. These may be acid addition and base salts of the compounds.

Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulfate/sulfate, borate, camsylate, citrate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulfate, naphthylate, 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts.

Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts. Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts. For a review on suitable salts, see “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use” by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the invention may be prepared by for example, one or more of the following methods:

(i) by reacting the compound of the invention with the desired acid or base;

(ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of the invention or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or

(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of the invention to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.

These methods are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.

Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric centre, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric centre and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. Where a compound of the invention has two or more stereo centres any combination of (R) and (S) stereoisomers is contemplated. The combination of (R) and (S) stereoisomers may result in a diastereomeric mixture or a single diastereoisomer. The compounds of the invention may be present as a single stereoisomer or may be mixtures of stereoisomers, for example racemic mixtures and other enantiomeric mixtures, and diasteroemeric mixtures. Where the mixture is a mixture of enantiomers the enantiomeric excess may be any of those disclosed above. Where the compound is a single stereoisomer the compounds may still contain other diasteroisomers or enantiomers as impurities. Hence a single stereoisomer does not necessarily have an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) or diastereomeric excess (d.e.) of 100% but could have an e.e. or d.e. of about at least 85%

The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centres; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of “Advanced Organic Chemistry”, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 2001), for example by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by resolution of a racemic form. Some of the compounds of the invention may have geometric isomeric centres (E- and Z-isomers). It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses all optical, diastereoisomers and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof that possess LOX inhibitory activity.

Compounds and salts described in this specification may be isotopically-labelled (or “radio-labelled”). Accordingly, one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of radionuclides that may be incorporated include 2H (also written as “D” for deuterium), 3H (also written as “T” for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F and the like. The radionuclide that is used will depend on the specific application of that radio-labelled derivative. For example, for in vitro competition assays, 3H or 14C are often useful. For radio-imaging applications, 11C or 18F are often useful. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is 3H. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is 14C. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is 11C. And in some embodiments, the radionuclide is 18F.

It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the invention may exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms that possess LOX inhibitory activity.

It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the invention may exhibit polymorphism, and that the invention encompasses all such forms that possess LOX inhibitory activity.

Compounds of the invention may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the invention include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several tautomeric forms, and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by compounds of the invention. Examples of tautomeric forms include keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aci-nitro.

The in vivo effects of a compound of the invention may be exerted in part by one or more metabolites that are formed within the human or animal body after administration of a compound of the invention.

Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words “comprise” and “contain” and variations of them mean “including but not limited to”, and they are not intended to (and do not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps. Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural unless the context otherwise requires. In particular, where the indefinite article is used, the specification is to be understood as contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the context requires otherwise.

Features, integers, characteristics, compounds, chemical moieties or groups described in conjunction with a particular aspect, embodiment or example of the invention are to be understood to be applicable to any other aspect, embodiment or example described herein unless incompatible therewith. All of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive. The invention is not restricted to the details of any foregoing embodiments. The invention extends to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the features disclosed in this specification (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), or to any novel one, or any novel combination, of the steps of any method or process so disclosed.

The reader's attention is directed to all papers and documents which are filed concurrently with or previous to this specification in connection with this application and which are open to public inspection with this specification, and the contents of all such papers and documents are incorporated herein by reference.

Further information on the preparation of the compounds of the invention is provided in the Examples section. The general reaction schemes and specific methods described in the Examples form a further aspect of the invention.

The resultant compound of the invention from the processes defined above can be isolated and purified using techniques well known in the art.

Compounds of the invention may exist in a single crystal form or in a mixture of crystal forms or they may be amorphous. Thus, compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, or spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.

The processes defined herein may further comprise the step of subjecting the compound of the invention to a salt exchange, particularly in situations where the compound of the invention is formed as a mixture of different salt forms. The salt exchange suitably comprises immobilising the compound of the invention on a suitable solid support or resin, and eluting the compounds with an appropriate acid to yield a single salt of the compound of the invention.

In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the invention obtainable by any one of the processes defined herein.

Certain of the intermediates described in the reaction schemes above and in the Examples herein are novel. Such novel intermediates, or a salt thereof, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, form a further aspect of the invention.

### Pharmaceutical Compositions

In accordance with another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, “Pharmaceuticals—The Science of Dosage Form Designs”, M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988.

The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing).

The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.

An effective amount of a compound of the present invention for use in therapy of a condition is an amount sufficient to symptomatically relieve in a warm-blooded animal, particularly a human the symptoms of the condition or to slow the progression of the condition.

The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent (more suitably from 0.5 to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition.

The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the invention will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.

In using a compound of the invention for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, a daily dose selected from 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous or intraperitoneal administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Suitably the compound of the invention is administered orally, for example in the form of a tablet, or capsule dosage form. The daily dose administered orally may be, for example a total daily dose selected from 1 mg to 2000 mg, 5 mg to 2000 mg, 5 mg to 1500 mg, 10 mg to 750 mg or 25 mg to 500 mg. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention.

**Proliferative Diseases—LOX and Cancer**

A further aspect of the invention provides a compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease. The proliferative disease may be malignant or non-malignant.

As mentioned in the Background to the invention, LOX plays a critical role in primary cancer and metastasis. Evidence supporting this role of LOX in primary tumour growth and metastasis is described below.

Studies have shown that LOX plays a fundamental role in the growth of primary tumours in colorectal and lung cancer (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010, Baker, Cox et al. 2011) and glioblastoma (Mammoto, Jiang et al. 2013). PDAC KRASmut/p53wt cells (which endogenously express low levels of LOX) were engineered to express high levels of human LOX. In murine allograft models using these cells primary tumour growth is increased significantly (Miller, Morton et al. 2015). Lysyl oxidase activity participates in primary tumor growth in a transgenic mouse model of aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by directly impacting the senescence stability (Wiel, Augert et al. 2013).

Expression of LOX is elevated in more than 70% of breast cancer patients with Estrogen Receptor negative disease, in 80% of head & neck cancer patients, in 33% of primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and 48% of metastatic tissues from patients with CRC (Baker, Cox et al. 2011), and in cirrhotic HCC patients with a history of alcoholism (Huang, Ho et al. 2013). LOX is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011), LKB1-mutant lung cancer (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010), aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma (Stewart, Gray et al. 2008), uveal melanoma (Abourbih, Di Cesare et al. 2010), oral and oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma (Albinger-Hegyi, Stoeckli et al. 2010), thyroid cancer (Boufraqech, Nilubol et al. 2015), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Vitalba et al, 2016), myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially myelofibrosis (Papadantonakis, Matsuura et al. 2012, Tadmor, Bejar et al. 2013) and pancreatic cancer (Sansom 2012, Miller, Morton et al. 2015).

**Lysyl-Oxidase-Like Isoforms and Cancer**

LOXL2 is another member of the LOX family that is involved in the cross-linking of extracellular collagens and elastin (Vadasz, Kessler et al. 2005) (Kim, Kim et al. 2010). In addition to conserved C-terminal region, the LOXL2 protein has scavenger receptor cysteine-rich regions that are commonly found in cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as a cytokine receptor-like domain.

LOXL2 expression has been found upregulated in breast, gastric, colon, esophageal, head and neck, lung and laryngeal carcinomas, as reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012) and in renal cells carcinoma (Hase, Jingushi et al. 2014) (Nishikawa, Chiyomaru et al. 2015). High LOXL2 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, laryngeal, oesophagus and breast cancer, increased metastases in colon and breast cancer, as well as drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells—reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012). Additionally, it has been shown that LOXL2 up-regulation increases the invasiveness of otherwise non-invasive breast cancer cells (Akiri, Sabo et al. 2003). Furthermore, LOXL2 and LOXL4 are required for metastatic niche formation in a breast orthotopic mouse model (Wong et al, 2011).

LOXL2 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis, histological grades and poor prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma, and knockdown of LOXL2 reduces invasion and metastasis (Xu, Li et al. 2014). HCC metastasis relies on LOXL2, which is overexpressed in tumor tissues and sera of HCC patients (Wong, Tse et al. 2014).

LOXL2 transcription is regulated by HIF-1 and upregulation of LOXL2 in hypoxia has been shown to downregulate E-cadherin leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Schietke, Warnecke et al. 2010) which is a key step in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis. This is in agreement with other reports where LOXL2 was shown to be involved in both EMT and tumour progression in murine squamous and spindle cell carcinomas (Fong, Dietzsch et al. 2007) (Moreno-Bueno, Salvador et al. 2011). LOXL2 expression is positively associated in CRC (Offenberg, Brunner et al. 2008). LOXL2 has also been linked to Src kinase/focal adhesion kinase (Src/FAK) pathway activation, and this appears to be the major pathway where secreted LOXL2 induces gastric tumour cell invasion and metastasis (Peng, Ran et al. 2009).

In certain cancers such as basal-like breast carcinoma and larynx squamous cell carcinoma perinuclear expression of LOXL2 is a marker of tumour aggressiveness and poor prognostic (Moreno-Bueno, Salvador et al. 2011) (Peinado, Moreno-Bueno et al. 2008).

Barry-Hamilton et al. reported that LOXL2 antibody treatment significantly reduces bone metastases from intracardiac injection of breast carcinoma cells (Barry-Hamilton, Spangler et al. 2010). In addition, Barker et al have provided preclinical evidence that LOXL2 inhibition is highly effective against spontaneous lung, liver and bone metastases of mammary carcinoma cells (Barker, Chang et al. 2011). Therefore, LOXL2 also represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of primary and metastatic cancer.

As mentioned in the Background to the Invention it is thought that although LOX and LOXL2 are involved in similar extra-cellular processes, it appears that they have distinct roles.

Other members of the LOX family, LOXL1, LOXL3 and LOXL3 are also implicated in proliferative conditions including cancer (see Background to the Invention).

Accordingly in one embodiment there is provided a compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment of a cancer. In one embodiment the cancer is non-metastatic. Accordingly the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a primary tumour in a subject.

**The Role of LOX in Cancer Metastasis**

Elevated LOX expression is associated with metastasis and decreased patient survival (Baker, Cox et al. 2011, Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011) Increased LOX expression is associated with disease grade, increased distant metastasis and lower overall survival in breast cancer patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumours (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006), in head & neck cancer patients (Albinger-Hegyi, Stoeckli et al. 2010, Toustrup, Sorensen et al. 2011), gastric cancer (Kasashima, Yashiro et al. 2015), hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhu, Huang et al. 2015), non-small cells lung cancer (Liu, Ping et al. 2014) and astrocytomas (da Silva, Uno et al. 2015), laryngeal cancer (Se, 2017). LOX expression is a determinant of poor survival in pancreatic cancer (Miller, Morton et al. 2015). Inhibition of LOX eliminates metastasis in mice with orthotopically grown human breast cancer (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006) and inhibits tumour angiogenesis in a human colorectal cancer model (Baker, Bird et al. 2013).

A polyclonal antibody that was raised against LOX and shown to inhibit its enzymatic activity, was able to block the metastatic spread of tumour cells to the lungs and livers of recipient mice in an orthotopic model of metastatic human breast cancer (Erler et al, 2006). Suppression of LOX expression using shRNA blocks metastatic spread of the breast cancer cells and that BAPN, the non-selective small molecule inhibitor of LOX can block metastatic tumour growth of these cells in mice (Erler et al, 2006). Furthermore, inhibition of tumour-secreted LOX by genetic (shRNA), antibody (Ab) or the irreversible non-selective small molecule inhibitor BAPN, significantly reduced invasion and metastasis of orthotopic human breast tumours or circulating human breast cancer cells (Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009, Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009, Levental, Yu et al. 2009), CRC (Baker, Cox et al. 2011), HCC (Huang, Ho et al. 2013), LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010), anaplastic thyroid cancer (Boufraqech, Nilubol et al. 2015) and PDAC in mice (Sansom 2012; Miller, Morton et al. 2015). High expression of LOX in primary breast tumours leads to osteolytic lesion formation; silencing or inhibition of LOX activity abrogates tumour-driven bone metastases (Cox, Rumney et al. 2015). LOX inhibition with BAPN and new inhibitor CCT365623 significantly reduce metastatic lung tumour burden in a mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer that metastasizes to the lungs (Tang et al, 2017).

LOX family members (especially LOX and LOXL2) play a critical role in the metastatic spread of cancer cells (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006, Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009, Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009, Levental, Yu et al. 2009, Gao, Xiao et al. 2010). In response to hypoxia (a condition that occurs due to inadequate blood supply when solid tumours exceed about 1 cm3 in size), cancer cells produce and secrete LOX into the circulation (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009).

LOX regulates invasion of cancer cells in vitro. Thus, cancer cells expressing high levels of LOX show increased ability to invade 3D collagen I and Matrigel matrices (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Furthermore, experimental over-expression of LOX enhances invasion of cancer cells, whereas genetic knock-down of LOX using RNA interference (RNAi; with both short hairpin RNA [shRNA] or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) or antisense technology) inhibits the in vitro invasion activity of cancer cells (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Similarly, a non-selective small molecule inhibitor of LOX, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) also blocks the in vitro invasion activity of several human cancer cell lines (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). LOX enhances hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in cervical cancer cells mediated by the EMT which can be inhibited by BAPN (Yang, Li et al. 2013). These studies implicate LOX in the invasive behaviour of cancer cells.

One of the critical functions of LOX appears to be to act remotely to pre-condition the niche at future sites of metastasis. Tumour cell metastasis is facilitated by these “premetastatic niches” formed in destination organs using invading bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). This “nest-building” activity is initiated when LOX becomes deposited at discreet sites in the target organ (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009). Studies have shown that bone marrow derived cell recruitment is an essential step in niche conditioning and metastatic spread of cancer (Kaplan et al, 2005). This mechanism underlines the importance of LOX for the invasive activity of cancer cells and for the earliest stages of metastasis, when the cancer cells first migrate out of the primary tumour. It has been shown that BMDCs and LOX co-localise in human metastatic tissue, and inhibition of LOX can prevent BMDC recruitment and metastasis in models of breast cancer metastasis (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009).

In addition to its roles in the early phases of metastasis, there is evidence that LOX is necessary to maintain the growth of the cancer cells once they arrive at the new metastatic sites because inhibition of LOX causes regression of these lesions, even after the development of metastatic disease (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009) (Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009). It was shown that although depletion of LOX does not affect tumour cell proliferation on plastic, it suppresses their growth in recombinant basement membrane (Matrigel) matrices (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Furthermore, cancer cells do not colonise the lungs efficiently when LOX is inhibited by shRNA (Erler et al, 2006) and it was found that metastatic lung tumours regress when mice are treated with LOX neutralising antibodies (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Notably, the colonisation of the lung by human breast cancer cells was enhanced when the cells were co-injected with conditioned medium from cells expressing LOX, but this was blocked if the mice were treated with conditioned medium in the presence of BAPN or a LOX antibody (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009). These findings demonstrate a requirement for tumour-secreted LOX to maintain metastatic growth.

LOX is essential for phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) downstream of integrin signalling (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). FAK is a tyrosine kinase that interacts with several signalling molecules and is critical for cell survival (van Nimwegen and van de Water 2007). LOX-mediated collagen cross-linking results in increased tissue stiffness and activation of the FAK/SRC signalling in in vitro and in vivo models of CRC. Cells expressing high levels of enzymatically active LOX have an increased capacity to proliferate, invade and metastasise. Thus LOX have both cell-dependent and cell-autonomous roles in metastatic tumour growth at several levels: enhances the ability of cancer cells to invade locally, possibly by enhancing migration away from the primary site; conditions the future metastatic sites in preparation for the arrival of the BMDCs and then tumour cells; supports the survival/proliferation of the cancer cells once they colonise the niche.

Host response to tumour surgery can promote further lung metastases in a mechanism mediated by LOX. Blocking LOX activity reduces the risk of lung metastases following surgery (Chen, 2017).

In particular a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use as an anti-invasive agent for use in the containment and/or treatment of solid tumour disease. In another embodiment a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the prevention or inhibition of cancer metastasis.

**LOX Family, Fibroblasts and Stroma**

Cancer associated fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells recruit fibroblasts through various growth factors and cytokines and form a myofibroblastic microenvironment that promotes cancer growth, survival, local invasion and metastasis (Karagiannis, Poutahidis et al. 2012). Persistent presence of myofibroblasts in cancer contributes to desmoplasia, a cancer-specific type of fibrosis. Desmoplasia and increased fibrosis have been associated with progression of several cancers such as breast, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric and hepatocellular (Barker, Cox et al. 2012). Desmoplasia is also an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in stromally-rich tumours (Zhao and Subramanian, 2017). LOX and LOX family members have an essential role in extracellular matrix remodelling and desmoplasia (Levental, 2009; Xiao, 2012). Lysyl oxidase family members expression, either secreted by cancer cells or by activated fibroblasts, has been found associated with tumour ECM, tumour stroma or tumour-associated vasculature of several cancers, such as colorectal, pancreatic, breast, laryngeal, endometrial, testicular, hepatocellular, renal (reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012)), gastric cancer (Kasashima, Yashiro et al. 2014), and to be involved in their progression and metastasis (Akiri, Sabo et al. 2003, Barry-Hamilton, Spangler et al. 2010, Barker, Bird et al. 2013) (Pickup, Laklai et al. 2013). Expression of LOXL4 is enhanced in keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT) stromal tissues and primary KCOT stromal fibroblasts (Jiang, Sima et al. 2014)

The benign condition may be endometriosis or a keratocystic odontogenic tumor.

**Fibrotic Diseases**

As discussed in the Background to the invention, LOX and LOXL are implicated in fibrotic diseases. Accordingly a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a fibrotic disorder. The fibrotic disorder may be a disorder characterised by excess fibrosis, e.g., an excess of fibrous connective tissue in a tissue or organ, e.g., triggered by a reparative or reactive process, e.g., in response to injury (e.g., scarring, healing) or excess fibrotic tissue arising from a single cell line (e.g., fibroma).

LOX has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and its inhibition with the alleviation of the symptoms (Di Donato, Ghiggeri et al. 1997, Haase 2009, Chen, Lin et al. 2015). Hyperuricemia results in hypertension, intrarenal vascular disease, and renal injury and is associated with increased expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and fibronectin in kidneys (Yang, Wang et al. 2010). Increased LOX activity has been linked to delayed graft failure after renal transplant, potentially due to increased local fibrosis (Zhi, 2017)

Similar involvement of LOX or LOXL2 in the pathology of disease and reduction in symptoms has been demonstrated for lung fibrosis (Barry-Hamilton, Spangler et al. 2010) (Haase 2009, Cox, Bird et al. 2013, Chien, Richards et al. 2014).

LOX and LOXL2 are involved in liver fibrosis (Kagan 1994, Marshall and Smith 2011) (Ricard-Blum, Bresson-Hadni et al. 1996) (Smith and Van Vlasselaer 2011) (Georges, Hui et al. 2007), liver cirrhosis (the last stage of liver fibrosis) (Kagan 1994) and related diseases such as Wilson's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis (Vadasz, Kessler et al. 2005). Therapeutic indications for LOX family inhibitors (such as simtuzumab, a humanized LOXL2 antibody) included a number of fibrotic conditons: myelofibrosis (Primary myelofibrosis, Post Polycythemia Vera or Post Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), liver fibrosis due to non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), HIV and/or Hepatitis C-infection or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and compensated liver cirrhosis due to NASH. Levels of lysyl oxidase are increased in patients with scleroderma and systemic sclerosis (Chanoki, Ishii et al. 1995) (Rimar, Rosner et al. 2014).

LOX inhibitors assist in collagen remodeling and re-establishment of collagen architecture in human Dupuytren's, keloid and scar fibroblasts (Priyanka, 2016).

The fibrotic disorder may be any of those discussed in the above three paragraphs. In one embodiment the compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a fibrotic disorder selected from:

(i) a fibrotic condition affecting the lungs, for example pulmonary fibrosis secondary to cystic fibrosis; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; coal worker's progressive massive fibrosis; cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease (ILD), diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or chronic asthma; or

(ii) a fibrotic condition affecting the liver, for example cirrhosis, and associated conditions such as chronic viral hepatitis B or C, Wilson's disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis; or

(iii) a fibrotic condition affecting the kidneys, for example diabetic nephropathy, vesicoureteral reflux, tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis; glomerulonephritis or glomerular nephritis, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous glomerulonephritis or mesangiocapillary glomerular nephritis;

(iv) a fibrotic condition affecting the heart or vascular system, for example endomyocardial fibrosis; old myocardial infarction; atrial fibrosis; congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease (HHD), hypertension (for example pulmonary hypertension) and fibrosis associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, restenosis (e.g. coronary, carotid, and cerebral lesions), and heart disease associated with cardiac ischemic events; or

(v) a fibrotic condition affecting the mediastinum, for example mediastinal fibrosis; or

(vi) a fibrotic condition affecting bone, for example myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis, post polycythemia vera or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis; or

(vii) a fibrotic condition affecting the retroperitoneum, for example retroperitoneal fibrosis skin; or

(viii) a fibrotic condition affecting the skin, for example nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, keloid formation and scarring, systemic sclerosis or scleroderma; or

(ix) a fibrotic condition affecting the GI tract, for example a fibrotic intestinal disorder, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcertative colitis or Crohn's disease; or

(x) a fibrotic condition affecting connective tissue, for example arthrofibrosis; or capsulitis; or

(xi) a fibrotic condition affecting the eye, for example ocular fibrosis following surgery or pseudoexfoliation syndrome glaucoma.

**LOX Family, Angiogenesis and Vasculature Permeability**

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for tumor growth and progression.

LOX and LOXL2 are key players in promoting angiogenesis in a number of tumour models, such as colorectal (Baker, Bird et al. 2013), ovarian, lung cancer (Zaffryar-Eilot, Marshall et al. 2013), melanoma (Osawa, Ohga et al. 2013), glioblastoma (Mammoto, Jiang et al. 2013). LOX is overexpressed in tumour endothelial cells (Osawa, Ohga et al. 2013). Increased LOX tumour expression is associated with increased VEGF expression (Mammoto, Jiang et al. 2013), (Baker, Bird et al. 2013).

Additionally, LOXL2 inhibition led to the normalisation of vasculature and increased tumour perfusion in ovarian xenograft and lung allograft mice models (Zaffryar-Eilot, Marshall et al. 2013).

Excessive angiogenesis is involved in a number of diseases in addition to cancer discussed above. LOX mediates vascular permeability by modulating the stiffness of the endothelial barrier. Abnormal vascular permeability, such as present in diseases such as pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or endotoxin-induced lung injury can be normalised by LOX inhibition (Mammoto, Mammoto et al. 2013) (Ingber and Mammoto 2014).

**Inflammatory Disorders**

Exacerbated inflammation and lung barrier dysfunction are hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition with dangerously high rates of morbidity and mortality. Increased LOX activity has been associated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation. Inhibition of LPS-induced ECM crosslinking and stiffening by LOX suppression reduced EC inflammatory activation and lung dysfunction. Thus LOX inhibitors can be useful for the treatment of ARDS (Mambetsariev, Tian et al. 2014). LOX and LOXL1 reduction and collagen crosslinking reduction have been associated with decreased inflammation in an Angiotensin II induced model of hypertension (Gonzalez, Rhaleb et al. 2014).

In an embodiment there is provided a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be useful in the treatment of an inflammatory condition. The inflammatory condition may be any of those described herein. For example the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of acute inflammation (e.g., mediated by an acute infection).

In an embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease, for example a disease selected from inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, gouty arthritis and spondylitis.

In an embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; psoriatic arthritis; Reiter's syndrome; traumatic arthritis; rubella arthritis; acute synovitis; gouty arthritis; or spondylitis; diabetes or gout.

In an embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of psoriasis; eczema; sarcoidosis, allergic rhinitis; allergic conjunctivitis; asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), endotoxin-induced lung injury, pulmonary inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and systemic cachexia.

In an embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, gouty arthritis or spondylitis, diabetes or gout.

In an embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of endotoxemia; toxic shock syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, a bone resorption disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, reperfusion injury, graft versus host reaction, allograft rejection, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, Gram negative sepsis, glomerulonephritis, restenosis, vasculitis, or thrombosis.

In another embodiment the compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of polymyositis, systemic lupus or interstitial nephritis.

**Cardiovascular Disease**

Interrupting collagen crosslinking by LOX with BAPN treatment reduces myocardial fibrosis in a mouse model, which is useful as potential therapeutic targeting of collagen regulation and thereby age-related myocardial fibrosis (Rosin, Sopel et al. 2015). Increased expression of LOX is associated with myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction (Zibadi, Vazquez et al. 2010) (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010) (Lopez, Gonzalez et al. 2010). Left atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation express higher levels of lysyl oxidase and fibronectin expression as well as collagen crosslinking. Fibronectin upregulation is mediated by LOX in cardiac fibroblasts (Adam, Theobald et al. 2011). LOX inhibitors can be useful for the prevention of fibrotic atrial remodelling. Inhibition of LOX by using a blocking antibody reduced cardiac fibrosis and infarct expansion in a mouse model (Gonzalez-Santamaria, 2016).

Lysyl oxidases play a causal role in experimental pulmonary hypertension and inhibition with BAPN reduces the symptoms (Nave, Mizikova et al. 2014). LOX facilitate the formation of crosslinked and therefore insoluble collagen and the subsequent left ventricle stiffness and systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and heart failure (HF) of hypertensive origin (Lopez, Gonzalez et al. 2013) (Lopez, Querejeta et al. 2012). A role for LOXL1 has been suggested in cardiac hypertrophy and BAPN administration inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (Ohmura, Yasukawa et al. 2012). LOX knockdown attenuates cardiac and vascular fibrosis in high fat diet induced obesity (Martinez-Martinez, 2016).

Lysyl oxidase inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic method for decreasing or preventing recurrent restenosis (Nuthakki, Fleser et al. 2004) (Brasselet, Durand et al. 2005). Increased LOX activity has been observed in atherosclerosis (Kagan, Raghavan et al. 1981). LOX is overexpressed in other pathologies associated with increased thrombosis, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic kidney disease and arterial stenosis and enhances platelets aggregation (Shinobu et al, 2016).

Accordingly in an embodiment compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a cardiovascular disease, for example any one of the diseases mentioned in this section, e.g. the treatment of atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, prevention of fibrotic atrial remodelling, old myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease (HHD), hypertension (for example pulmonary hypertension) and fibrosis associated with hypertension, restenosis (e.g. coronary, carotid, and cerebral lesions), and heart disease associated with cardiac ischemic events.

**Neurological Conditions**

As discussed in the Background to the Invention, LOX is associated with nurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. Accordingly, in one embodiment there is provided a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a neurological condition mediated by LOX or LOXL. The neurological condition may be Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) or non-Alzheimer's dementia.

LOX is increased at the site of brain injury (Gilad, Kagan et al. 2001) and spinal cord injury and its inhibition lead to accelerated functional recovery in a unilateral spinal cord dissection model (Gilad and Gilad 2001). Accordingly a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment nerve damage, for example the promotion of nerve regrowth and/or recovery after spinal cord injury.

**Pulmonary Diseases**

LOXL2 and LOXL3 are likely to have a role in Primary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) since both are expressed in PAP tissue, but not normal lung tissue (Neufeld and Brekhman 2009). Excessive lysyl oxidase activity was linked to the pathologic pulmonary features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Kumarasamy, Schmitt et al. 2009). A compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of primary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

**Eye Diseases**

Increased LOXL2 levels have been associated with failure following glaucoma surgery and treatment with a LOXL2 antibody reduced pathological angiogenesis, inflammation, and ocular fibrosis (Park, Kim et al. 2014) (Van Bergen, Marshall et al. 2013) (Stalmans, Van Bergen et al. 2011). Expression of lysyl oxidase-type enzymes increases following laser-induced chloroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in parallel with fibrotic damage. Inhibition of LOX or LOXL2 prevents neovascularization and fibrosis following laser-induced CNV. Therefore LOX and LOXL inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of conditions characterized by neovascularization, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (Stalmans, Marshall et al. 2010). LOXL1 expression is increased in the initial stages of abnormal fibrogenesis in pseudoexfoliation syndrome/glaucoma tissues (Zenkel, Krysta et al. 2011) (Schlotzer-Schrehardt, Pasutto et al. 2008).

A compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of an ocular condition mediated by LOX or a LOXL, for example any of the ocular conditions listed in the paragraph above.

**Other Diseases**

LOX is the main isoenzyme expressed in human adipose tissue and that its expression is strongly upregulated in samples from obese patients. β-aminopropionitrile reduces body weight gain and improves the metabolic profile in diet-induced obesity in rats (Miana, Galan et al. 2015) and reduces local adipose tissue inflammation (Halberg, Khan et al. 2009). In an embodiment a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of obesity.

LOX has been suggested as a new therapeutic target in bacterial infections and subsequent fibrotic complications. LOX is upregulated in infections with Staphylococcus Aureus and inhibition with BAPN influences resulting abscesses morphology and collagenisation (Beerlage, Greb et al. 2013). LOX is implicated also in some parasitic diseases: LOX and LOXLs are upregulated in the early stages of liver granuloma development in schistosomiasis (Decitre, Gleyzal et al. 1998), and BAPN inhibition reduces the size of the granulomas and reduces the egg load in combination with antiparasitic drug PZQ compared to PZQ alone (Giboda, Zenka et al. 1992).

In one embodiment, the compound is for use in the treatment of a bacterial infection, for example infection with Staphylococcus Aureus. The compound of the invention may be for use in the treatment or prevention of infection associated fibrosis, for example to prevent or inhibit abcess formation associated with the infection. The formation of abcesses can provide a favourable microenvironment for the bacteria to multiply. Inhibition of abcess formation may be beneficial in that it may provide enhanced exposure of the bacertia to antibiotics at the site of infection, because the shielding effect provided by the abcess would be reduced or eliminated. Thus combination treatments comprising a compound of the invention together with an antibiotic agent may provide an enhanced antibacterial effect. The compound of the invention may also be for use in the prevention or inhibition of tissue fibrosis following eradication of the infection and healing of the infection sites.

In one embodiment, the compound is for use in the treatment of a parasitic infection, for example schistosomiasis.

**EGFR Mediated Conditions**

Elevated levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a growth-factor-receptor tyrosine kinase, and/or its ligands is observed in many cancer types and is involved in the promotion of tumour growth. EGFR inhibitors have been directed to a number of cancer types, including NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, squamous cells carcinoma, skin cancer, thyroid, colorectal, prostate, gastric, renal, breast, head & neck cancers, glioma, meningiomas, mesothelioma, cervical carcinomas epidermal carcinomas (reviewed in Bianco et al (Bianco, Gelardi et al. 2007)). Elevated EGFR was found to act as a strong indicator of poor prognosis in head and neck, ovarian, cervical, bladder and oesophageal cancers (Nicholson, Gee et al. 2001). EGFR inhibitors have also been proposed for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (Ree, Bratland et al. 2008), biliary cancer such as cholangiocarcinoma with a mutation in ERRFI1 (Borad, Carpten et al. 2014).

Blockade of the kinase activity of EGFR does not reach maximum therapeutic efficacy. LOX inhibitors reduce the level of surface EGFR suggesting the possibility that these compounds will have an effect on reducing EGFR activation (Tang et al, 2017).

EGFR inhibition has been targeted as treatment for a number of other diseases, such as prevention and treatment of obesity (Threadgill and Barrick 2007), treatment of Alzheimer's disease (Ma 2013), treatment of Chlamydia infection and related diseases (Tsang and Furdui 2015), treatment of viral diseases (Jung 2010), promotion of axon regeneration (He and Koprivica 2007), treatment of genetic skin disorders characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratinocyte hyperplasia, and/or ichthyosis (Alexandrescu 2009).

Given the role of LOX inhibition in modulating the surface EGFR levels and EGFR signalling, LOX inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases which can be targeted by EGFR inhibition.

In an embodiment there is provided a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a disorder (e.g., a disease) that is ameliorated by the inhibition of EGFR. The EGFR mediated condition may be, for example, any of those listed in this section or elsewhere in the description. The compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be for use in the treatment of a cancer which over-expresses EGFR. The cancer over-expressing EGFR may be, for example NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, squamous cells carcinoma, skin cancer, thyroid, colorectal, prostate, renal, breast, head & neck cancers, glioma, mesothelioma, epidermal carcinomas ovarian, cervical, bladder and oesophageal cancers or a biliary cancer such as cholangiocarcinoma.

In one embodiment, the compound is for use in the treatment of a viral infection, for example Rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, picornavirus, metapneumovirus, hantavirus, measles virus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus.

In one embodiment, the compound is for use in the treatment of Chlamydia infection.

In one embodiment, the compound is for use in the treatment of a genetic skin disorder, for example a keratinization disorder is selected from among Darier's disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, erythrodermic autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis, nonerythrodermic autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis, autosomal dominant lamellar ichthyosis, bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, palmoplantar keratoderma, erythrokeratodermia variabilis, verrucous epidermal nevi, Pityriasis rubra pilaris, Netherton syndrome, idiopathic vulgaris, ichthyosis vulgaris, monilethrix, keratosis piliaris, bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma, nonbullous congenital ichthyosis, Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, erythrokeratodermica variabilis, hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, eythrokeratodermia figurate variabilis, mutilating keratoderma of Vohwinkel, Harlequin ichthyosis and Tay's syndrome.

### Biomarkers

The present invention therefore provides the possibility of a clinical test to predict response to LOX inhibition therapy, preferably prior to a subject commencing LOX inhibition therapy. Such a test will inform the clinician whether the patient is likely to respond to LOX inhibition therapy or not, and enable the clinician to commence alternative therapy if the patient is predicted to be unlikely to respond. This will benefit the patient by targeting their treatment with an appropriate therapy early, rather than relying on the current “trial and error” approach. Such a test will therefore enable better of targeting of LOX inhibition therapy to patients early in their disease, when maximum effect can be achieved, and may result in greater access to these drugs as they are used in a more cost-efficient manner.

The present invention is advantageous in enabling likely responders and non-responders to be identified, so that non-responders may be provided alternative treatment, and those who are not non-responders (and therefore may be a moderate or good responder) may be provided LOX inhibition therapy. As a result of the present invention, LOX inhibition therapies may therefore be used in a more targeted and cost-efficient manner.

For the purposes of the biomarker and stratification aspects disclosed herein a “LOX inhibitor” is an agent which is able to reduce the expression, reduce the catalytic activity or prevent maturation of LOX. Suitably the LOX inhibitor is a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Any suitable source of lysyl oxidase may be employed for the determination of LOX inhibition. The enzyme can be derived, isolated, or recombinantly produced from any source known in the art, including yeast, microbial, and mammalian, that will permit the generation of a suitable product that can generate a detectable reagent or will be biologically active in a suitable assay. In one embodiment, the lysyl oxidase is of human, bovine, or other mammalian origin. See, e.g., Williams, et al., Anal. Biochem. 113:336 (1985); Kirschmann et al., supra; Cancer Res. 62:4478-83 (2002); LOX may be obtained from Accession No. NP00238 (preprotein sequence); Accession No. NM02317 (DNA sequence). A functional fragment or a derivative of lysyl oxidase that still substantially retains its enzymatic activity catalyzing the oxidation of lysyl oxidase can also be used. The lysyl oxidase enzyme can sometimes be the pre-proprotein, proprotein, the protein, or a biologically active fragment thereof.

The enzymatic activity of lysyl oxidase can be assessed by any suitable method. Exemplary methods of assessing lysyl oxidase activity include that of Trackman et al., Anal. Biochem. 113:336-342 (1981); Kagan, et al., Methods Enzymol. 82A:637-49 (1982); Palamakumbura et al., Anal. Biochem. 300:245-51 (2002); Albini et al., Cancer Res. 47: 3239-45 (1987); Kamath et al, Cancer Res. 61:5933-40 (2001); for example.

The enzymatic activity of the lysyl oxidase may be assessed by detecting and/or quantitating “lysyl oxidase byproducts,” such as H2O2 production; collagen pyridinium residues ammonium production; aldehyde product production; lysyl oxidation, or deoxypyridinoline (Dpd). One may also detect and quantitate cellular invasive capacity in vitro; cellular adhesion and growth in vitro; and metastatic growth in vivo. In vivo models include, but are not limited to suitable syngeneic models, human tumor xenograft models, orthotopic models, metastatic models, transgenic models, and gene knockout models. See, e.g., Teicher, Tumors Models in Cancer Research (Humana Press 2001).

A compound is an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase expression or biological activity when the compound reduces the expression or activity or lysyl oxidase relative to that observed in the absence of the compound. In one embodiment, a compound is an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase when the compound reduces the incidence of metastasis relative to the observed in the absence of the compound and, in further testing, inhibits metastatic tumor growth.

The tumor inhibition can be quantified using any convenient method of measurement. For example, the incidence of metastasis can be assessed by examining relative dissemination (e.g., number of organ systems involved) and relative tumor burden in these sites. Metastatic growth can be ascertained by microscopic or macroscopic analysis, as appropriate. Tumor metastasis can be reduced by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or greater.

In one embodiment, lysyl oxidase expression is assessed using promoter analysis. Any convenient system for promoter activity analysis can be employed. Typically, the reporter gene system allows promoter activity to be detected using the lysyl oxidase promoter attached to a reporter molecule such that promoter activity results in the expression of the reporter molecule. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, current edition) at chapter 9.6.

Also, LOX may be inhibited by degradation of its mRNA. An approach to this form of gene regulation is described in Wilson et al. “Modulation of LDL receptor mRNA stability by phorbol esters in human liver cell culture models,” Lipid Res. 38, 437-446 (1997).

The lysyl oxidase inhibitor compounds of the present invention may be used in the LOX inhibition therapy described herein.

The present invention provides an improved method for prediction of response to anti-LOX inhibition therapy, using biomarkers which could not have been predicted from the prior art as being indicative of a favourable response.

Throughout this section, the terms patient and subject are used interchangeably herein to refer to an individual for whom it is desirable to determine likely response to LOX inhibition therapy. Such an individual may have, or be predisposed to having, or expected to develop, cancer.

A biomarker as used herein is a biologically derived indicator of a process, event, or condition. Biomarkers can be used in methods of diagnosis, e.g. clinical screening, and prognosis assessment and in monitoring the results of therapy, identifying patients most likely to respond to a particular therapeutic treatment, drug screening and development. A biomarker may be a gene, exhibiting differential expression between responders and non-responders to LOX inhibition therapy. Expression of a biomarker gene (transcription and optionally translation) may be determined by measuring an expression product of the gene, referred to herein as a target molecule. A combination of two or more biomarkers may be referred to herein as a panel or a genetic signature which correlates with likely response to LOX inhibition therapy.

Predicting response means making a determination of the likely effect of treatment in a subject. Prediction typically means an assessment made prior to commencing the relevant treatment, although it is understood that a prediction of the likely response to a particular treatment may be made whilst a subject is receiving an alternative treatment. Predicting response to therapy, within the scope of the present invention may also include making an assessment of likely continued response to LOX inhibition therapy. Therefore, prediction of response may include a determination of likely response during a course of LOX inhibition therapy.

A sample may be selected from the group comprising tissue sample, such as a biopsy sample; and a body fluid sample. A body fluid sample may be a blood sample. A blood sample may be a peripheral blood sample. It may be a whole blood sample, or cellular extract thereof. In one embodiment, preferably the sample is a tissue sample.

The level of a target molecule herein refers to a measure of the amount of a target molecule in a sample. The level may be based upon a measure of one type of target molecule indicative of expression specific for a particular biomarker (i.e. DNA, RNA or protein). The level may alternatively be based upon a measure of a combination of two or more types of target molecule indicative of expression specific for a particular biomarker (i.e. two or more of DNA, RNA and protein). The level of a target molecule may be expressed as a direct measure of the amount of target molecule (for example concentration (mg/vol sample) or RPKM).

Elevated level means an increase in level (i.e. amount) of a target molecule compared to the level of the same target molecule in a subject who does not have cancer. An elevated level includes any statistically significant increase compared to the control. The level of a target molecule indicative of expression of a biomarker in a subject which does not have cancer or a disease associated with overexpression of EGFR may be referred to as a reference value or baseline value.

The elevated level of the target molecule representative of gene expression may be assessed by comparing the amount of the target molecule present in the patient sample under investigation with a reference value indicative of the amount of the target molecule in a control sample.

References herein to the “same” level of target molecule or biomarker expression indicate that the biomarker expression of the sample is identical to the reference or baseline value. References herein to a “similar” level of target molecule or biomarker expression indicate that the biomarker expression of the sample is not identical to the reference or baseline value but the difference between them is not statistically significant i.e. the levels have comparable quantities.

Suitable control samples for determination of a reference value or baseline value may be derived from individuals without a disease associated with overexpression of EGFR and without cancer. A control sample may be age matched with the patient undergoing investigation. Reference values or baseline value may be obtained from suitable individuals and used as a general reference value for multiple analysis.

Favourable response to LOX inhibition therapy may include, without limitation, treatment or prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms of a condition. “Treating” or “treatment” of a state, disorder or condition therefore includes: (1) preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition developing in a human that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition, (2) inhibiting the state, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting, reducing or delaying the development of the disease or a relapse thereof (in case of maintenance treatment) or at least one clinical or subclinical symptom thereof, or (3) relieving or attenuating the disease, i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or at least one of its clinical or subclinical symptoms. Thus, favourable response to LOX inhibition therapy includes delay or reduction of proliferation of tumour growth and/or delay of metastasis.

Target molecules as used herein may be selected from the group consisting of: a biomarker protein; and nucleic acid encoding the biomarker protein. The nucleic acid may be DNA or RNA. In an embodiment the nucleic acid is mRNA. Reference herein to a target molecule may include one type of biological molecule (i.e. DNA or RNA or protein) or a combination of two or more types of such biological molecules, all indicative of the expression of the same biomarker.

A binding partner may be selected from the group comprising: complementary nucleic acids; aptamers; receptors, antibodies or antibody fragments. By a specific binding partner is meant a binding partner capable of binding to at least one such target molecule in a manner that can be distinguished from non-specific binding to molecules that are not target molecules. A suitable distinction may, for example, be based on distinguishable differences in the magnitude of such binding.

One aspect of the present invention may make use of one or more target molecules, each target molecule being indicative of the expression of a different biomarker selected from the group consisting of: EGFR, MATN2, HTRA1 and pSMAD2. This aspect of the invention may make use of two or more or three or more, target molecules, each being indicative of the expression of a different biomarker selected from the group consisting of: EGFR, MATN2, HTRA1 and pSMAD2.

In an embodiment, the present invention may make use of a target molecule indicative of the expression of EGFR.

In an embodiment, the present invention may make use of a target molecule indicative of the expression of MATN2.

In an embodiment, the present invention may make use of two or more target molecules or three or more biomarkers, each being indicative of the expression of a different biomarker. For example, wherein the biomarkers are EGFR and MATN2; MATN2 and pSMAD2 or EGFR and pSMAD2.

Therefore, the present invention identifies an expression signature which identifies subjects who are unlikely to respond or are likely to respond to LOX inhibition therapy. In an embodiment, the signature is characterized by an up regulation of MATN2, an upregulation of EGFR, an upregulation of homotrimeric HTRA1, a down regulation of pSMAD2 or a combination thereof.

A method of increasing the sensitivity (efficacy) rate, or identifying increased likelihood of response to LOX inhibitors in accordance with the present invention will preferably be carried out in vitro, but it will be appreciated that a method of the invention may also be carried out in vivo.

A level of a target molecule may be investigated using a binding partner for the target molecule. A binding partner may be specific for a target molecule. In the context of the present invention, a binding partner specific to a target molecule will be capable of binding to at least one such target molecule in a manner that can be distinguished from non-specific binding to molecules that are not target molecules. A suitable distinction may, for example, be based on distinguishable differences in the magnitude of such binding.

Reference to a protein target may include precursors or variants produced on translation of the transcripts produced when the gene is expressed. Therefore, where a protein undergoes modification between first translation and its mature form, the precursor and/or the mature protein may be used as suitable target molecules. As above, techniques by which protein target molecules may be preserved within a patient sample, thus facilitating its detection, will be well known to those skilled in the art. A protein target may be found within a cell of a patient sample, or may be secreted or released from the cell.

In embodiments of the present invention where the target molecule is a protein, a binding partner may be used to determine the level of the protein in a sample obtained from the subject. A suitable binding partner may be is selected from the group consisting of: aptamers; receptors, and antibodies or antibody fragments. Suitable methods for determining the level of a protein in a sample are available in the art. For example, in certain embodiments of the methods or devices of the invention the binding partner is an antibody, or antibody fragment, and the detection of the target molecules utilises an immunological method. In certain embodiments of the methods or devices, the immunological method may be an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) including variants such as sandwich ELISAs; radioimmuno assays (RIA). In other embodiments an immunological method may utilise a lateral flow device. Other suitable techniques may include multiplex assays such as Luminex or proteomic MRM or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS); chemiluminescence.

In certain embodiments, a binding partner may be labelled, for example using a reporter moiety such as a fluorophore, chromogenic substrate or chromogenic enzyme. Where it is desired that the invention will make use of reporter moieties, the reporter moieties may be directly attached to the binding partners. Examples of such embodiments include those utilising labelled antibodies. Alternatively, the reporter moieties may be attached to reporter molecules that interact with the binding partners. Examples of such embodiments include those utilising antibodies indirectly attached to a reporter moiety by means of biotin/avidin complex.

In embodiments where the target molecule is a nucleic acid, binding partners may be complementary nucleic acids and aptamers, for example provided in a microarray or chip. Methods for determining the level of a nucleic acid target molecule in a sample are available in the art. In an embodiment, a suitable target molecule representative of gene expression may comprise an RNA transcript translatable to yield a protein. mRNA of this sort will typically be found within a patient sample. In particular, the transcriptome of white blood cells, for example neutrophils, of a patient sample have been found to provide a biomarker signature with improved sensitivity and specificity for determining non-responders and/or good responders to anti-TNF therapy, and the use of mRNA and in particular the transcriptome may represent a preferred embodiment. Use of mRNA as the target molecule has advantages in that the assays for detecting mRNA (such as quantitative rtPCR or the like) tend to be cheaper than methods for detecting protein (such as ELISAs). mRNA assays can be more readily multiplexed, allowing for high throughput analysis; nucleic acids generally show greater stability than their protein counterparts; and processing of the sample to obtain and amplify nucleic acid is generally simpler than for protein.

Techniques by which mRNA may be collected, purified and amplified as necessary, are well known to those skilled in the art. In an embodiment, the present invention may make use of transcriptome analysis for determining biomarker expression. Suitable techniques for determining the level of RNA in a sample, for example by transcriptome analysis, may include hybridization techniques, for example by detecting binding to a nucleic acid library, quantitative PCR, and high throughput sequencing including tag based sequencing such as SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and RNA-seq.

The above examples are non-limiting, and the methods of the invention may make use of any appropriate assay by which the presence or elevated levels of a requisite target molecule may be detected. It will be appreciated that suitable assays may be determined with reference to the nature of the target molecule to be detected and/or the nature of the patient sample to be used.

Multiple samples may be processed simultaneously, sequentially or separately. Multiple samples may be processed simultaneously, for example in a high throughput method.

Suitably, the present invention may also provide kits for carrying out the stratification or biomarker methods disclosed herein. Such kits may contain compounds by which the presence or elevated levels of a requisite target molecule may be detected, such as antibodies to one or more biomarkers of the present invention. Optionally, the kit may further comprise one or more of a set of instructions for use, a chart providing reference or baseline values for at least the biomarker to de detected using the kits; and reagents.

Once the amounts or concentrations of the target molecules in the patient sample have been determined, this information may be used as the basis of an assessment of the predicted response to LOX inhibition therapy, which may, in turn, be used to suggest a suitable course of treatment for the patient. The assessment may be qualitative or quantitative.

An elevated level of a biomarker may include at least 10%, 15, 20, 30, 40 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% or more increase compared to the baseline or reference value level. In one embodiment, an elevated level may be 1 fold or more difference relative to the baseline or reference value, such as a fold difference of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 15 or 20 or any ranges there between. In one embodiment, the higher level is between a 1 and 15 fold difference relative to the baseline level, such as between a 1.5 and 12 fold difference relative to the baseline level. In a further embodiment, the higher level is between a 1 and 7 fold difference relative to the baseline level. It is appreciated that elevation levels may differ from the same biomarker depending on the target molecule being used. Where nucleic acid and protein target molecules are used for any particular biomarker, an elevated level may be expressed individually for a target molecule, or may be expressed as a sum or average of the target molecules.

The invention may produce a quantitative output, based upon elevation values for a biomarker or a sum or biomarkers. Alternatively, the invention may provide a qualitative output, based on likely response, for example yes/no; elevated; non-elevated; responder/non-responder; good, moderate or low based on EULAR criteria, etc. Where the levels of two or more target molecules are determined, a composite score may be determined, which may be compared to a composite score of reference values for the same target molecules.

In certain embodiments the methods or devices of the invention may further involve investigating physiological measurements of the patient.

In a further embodiment, there is provided a method for treating a subject having cancer, wherein it was previously determined (or previously estimated) that the cancer is associated with overexpression of EGFR compared to a reference value, the method comprising administering an therapeutically effective amount of a LOX Inhibitor of the invention to the subject.

LOX inhibitors can disrupt EGFR membrane localisation, block EGFR signalling and, thereby, suppress tumour growth in cancers associated with overexpression of EGFR. As such, LOX inhibitors will have particular utility in the treatment of cancers associated with overexpression of EGFR.

In one aspect, the present invention relates to a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention for use in the treatment or prevention of a cancer associated with overexpression of EGFR.

In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a cancer associated with overexpression of EGFR.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating or preventing cancer in a subject, said method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention to said subject, wherein said subject has a cancer or has a predisposition for a cancer associated with overexpression of EGFR.

Optionally, the method may comprise determining the level EGFR in a biological sample of said subject, and administering a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention to said subject when the presence of EGFR is determined to be overexpressed in the biological sample.

By “EGFR overexpression” it is meant the presence of increased copies of the EGFR gene or increased EPGR protein (preferably at the surface) in or on a cancer cell compared to a non cancerous cell of the same tissue type. Thus, in one embodiment overexpression may be defined as at least a two-fold amplification of the EGFR gene, as determined by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), or as a positive staining using anti-EGFR antibodies in an immunohistochemistry (INC) assay. In addition or in the alternative, overexpression may be measured by the fraction of cell membrane labelled with a specific antibody; thus overexpression of EGFR may be defined as at least 1% or at least 2% or at least 3% membranous staining and 1+(or 2+ or 3+) intensity, or at least 10% membranous staining. Furthermore, cells may be classified as cells that do not express, or have undetectable levels of EGFR, cells expressing low levels of EGFR (about 1000 to about 100,00 receptors/cell), medium levels of EGFR (about 10,000 to about 100,000 receptors/cell) and cells expressing high levels of EGFR (about 1×106 or more receptors/cell). Therefore, the cancer susceptible to treatment using a LOX inhibitor of the present invention are cancers characterized by two-fold or greater amplification of the EGFR gene, positive (1+, 2+, or 3+) IHC assay, at least 1%, or at least 10% membranous staining, medium or high levels of EGFR and preferably cancer cells characterized by high levels of EGFR. Suitably, overexpression may be determined using anti-EGFR antibodies (preferably anti-HER1) in an immunohistochemistry (INC) assay.

Optionally, the method may further comprise the steps of determining the level of MATN2, pSMAD2 or both MATN2 and pSMAD2 in a biological sample of said subject, and administering a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention to said subject when:


- - a) the level of MATN2 is greater than a reference sample;
  - b) the level of pSMAD2 is lower than a reference sample; or
  - c) the level of MATN2 is greater than a reference sample and the
    level of pSMAD2 is lower than a reference sample.

Suitably, the cancer may be selected from the group consisting of: NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, squamous cells carcinoma, skin cancer, thyroid, colorectal, prostate, renal, breast, head & neck cancers, glioma, mesothelioma, epidermal carcinomas ovarian, cervical, bladder and oesophageal cancers and a biliary cancer such as cholangiocarcinoma.

Optionally, in all aspects of the invention, the lysyl oxidase inhibitor may inhibit maturation of lysyl oxidase and/or inhibit the catalytic activity of lysyl oxidase. Suitably, the lysyl oxidase inhibitor may not inhibit MAO-A and/or MAO-B. Suitably, inhibition of MAO-A and/or MAO-B may be determined using the in vitro oxidase-A/-B activity assay as described in the Examples. Suitably, the lysyl oxidase inhibitor may not inhibit DAO and/or hERG.

In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of increasing the sensitivity rate (efficacy rate) of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention to treat cancer in a patient population said method comprising selecting a sub population which overexpresses an EGFR and, optionally overexpresses MATN2 and/or HTRA1. Optionally, said subgroup may also exhibit reduced expression of pSMAD2.

By “increased likelihood of responsiveness or sensitivity to a LOX inhibitor” it is meant a higher prediction of a favourable effects associated with LOX inhibition therapy.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of determining a treatment regimen for a subject with cancer, comprising:


- - a) determining the level of EGFR (and optionally MATN2 or HTRA1) in
    a biological sample; and
  - b) administering a treatment regimen comprising a therapeutically
    effective amount of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention, when
    levels of EGFR (and optionally increased MATN2 and/or HTRA1) are
    elevated compared to a reference sample.

**MATN2**

Matrilin2 (MATN2) is a secreted protein with 10 EGF-like repeats (Wagener, R. et al. The matrilins—adaptor proteins in the extracellular matrix. FEBS Lett 579, 3323-3329, doi:10.1016/j.febslet.2005.03.018 (2005)). A protein sequence of human MATN2 may be obtained from uniprot (Universal protein resource) reference 000339-1.

Advantageously, the present invention has surprisingly shown that recombinant human MATN2 increase the levels of EGFR at the surface of the cell and thus MATN2 strongly enhances EGF-induced EGFR activation. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that MATN2 binding traps EGFR at the cell surface to present it to EGF for activation.

It has been surprisingly found that LOX inhibitors can downregulate expression of MATN2 which leads to increased internalisation of EGFR. Accordingly, the LOX inhibitors of the invention may have particular utility in the treatment of cancers having elevated levels of MATN2 compared to a reference sample.

Suitably, levels of MATN2 may be determined using immunofluorescence using a commercially available anti-human MATN2 antibody (e.g. from R&D). For example, the sample may be subjected to incubation with primary anti-MATN2 antibodies followed by fluorescence secondary antibodies (such as those available from Life Technologies) and then the levels determined using confocal imaging. An identical procedure is carried out on a reference sample so that it can be determined if MATN2 levels are increased.

Thus, MATN2 (optionally in combination with EGFR) may be used as a biomarker to predict responsiveness or sensitivity of a patient suffering from cancer to treatment with a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention. Optionally, one or more further biomarkers may be used such as pSMAD2.

In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of increasing the sensitivity rate (efficacy rate) of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention to treat cancer in a patient population said method comprising selecting a sub population which has enhanced expression of MATN2. Optionally, said subgroup may also exhibit reduced expression of pSMAD2.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of identifying a subject having increased likelihood of responsiveness or sensitivity to a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention comprising:


- - a) determining the level of MATN2 in a biological sample of the
    subject;  
    wherein increased levels MATN2 compared to a reference sample
    indicates an increased likelihood of responsiveness or sensitivity
    to a lysyl oxidase inhibitor in the subject.

In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of identifying a subject having responsiveness or sensitivity to a lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention comprising:


- - a) determining the level of MATN2 in a biological sample of the
    subject;  
    wherein increased levels MATN2 compared to a reference sample
    identifies the subject as having responsiveness or sensitivity to a
    lysyl oxidase inhibitor of the invention.

Optionally, in all methods of the invention, the methods may comprise a further step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor when the subject is identified has have increased likelihood of responsiveness of sensitivity to a lysyl oxidase inhibitor.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of determining a treatment regimen for a subject with cancer, comprising:


- - a) determining the level of MATN2 in a biological sample; and
  - b) administering a treatment regimen comprising a therapeutically
    effective amount of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor, when levels MATN2 are
    elevated compared to a reference sample.

**SMAD2**

Smad proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. SMAD2 mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the TGF-beta receptors through its interaction with the Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. A human protein sequence may be obtained from uniprot (Universal protein resource) reference Q15796.

The present invention has surprisingly found strong activation of SMAD2 in LOX deficient cells and that TGFβ1 downregulates MATN2 mRNA. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that LOX inhibitors may activate SMAD2 which will lead to the downregulation of MATN2. Accordingly, activation of SMAD2 (which may be measured by upregulation of phospho-SMAD2 (pSMAD2)) will lead to a reduction of EGFR at the cell surface. Thus, SMAD2 may be used as a biomarker to determine response to treatment with a LOX inhibitor.

Suitably, levels of pSMAD2 may be determined using an anti-pSMAD2 antibody (such as those commercially available from Millipore).

**HTRA1**

HTRA1 is a secreted serine protease known to block TGFβ1 signalling by cleaving mature TGFβ1. A protein sequence for HTRA1 may be obtained from uniprot (Universal protein resource) reference Q92743 version 1.

Advantageously, the present invention has surprisingly shown that LOX depletion reduces the levels of extracellular homotrimeric HTRA1, the active form of this enzyme and HTRA1 suppresses SMAD2 activation and rescues MATN2 expression in LOX depleted cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that reducing HTRA1 will activate SMAD2 causing a reduction in the expression of MATN2 mRNA. As the present invention has shown MATN2 binding traps EGFR at the cell surface to present it to EGF for activation, it is believed that elevated protein stability of HTRA1 will indicate an increased likelihood of response to treatment with a LOX inhibitor. Hence, HTRA1 may be used as a biomarker.

Accordingly, the LOX inhibitors may have particular utility in the treatment of cancers having elevated levels of HTRA1 compared to a reference sample.

Suitably, levels of HTRA1 may be determined using immunofluorescence using a commercially available anti-human HTRA1 antibody (anti-human HTRA1 antibody, R&D). For example, the sample may be subjected to incubation with primary anti-HTRA1 antibodies followed by fluorescence secondary antibodies (such as those available from Life Technologies) and then the levels determined using confocal imaging. An identical procedure is carried out on a reference sample so that it can be determined if HTRA1 levels are increased.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of determining a treatment regimen for a subject with cancer, comprising:


- - a) determining the level of HTRA1 in a biological sample; and
  - b) administering a treatment regimen comprising a therapeutically
    effective amount of a lysyl oxidase inhibitor, when levels HTRA1 are
    elevated compared to a reference sample.

### In Vitro Methods

In another aspect, the present invention further comprises an in vitro method of downregulating MATN2 expression in a cell, comprising the step of contacting the cell with a LOX inhibitor of the invention.

In a further aspect, the present invention also provides upregulating pSMAD2 in a cell comprising contacting a cell with a LOX inhibitor of the invention.

Suitably, in all aspects, the cell may be a cell-line, preferably a mammalian cell line.

Suitably, the cell may be a cancer cell, preferably a cancer cell associated with overexpression of EGFR.

### Combination Therapies e.g. for the Treatment of Cancer

LOX inhibition can be a useful method for improving the efficacy of other drugs or addressing resistance to drug treatment through a number of mechanisms. Specific inhibition of LOX with siRNA can induce apoptosis of laryngeal cancer Hep-2 cells and enhance the sensitivity of Hep-2 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin (Dong, Lu et al. 2014) and to radiation (Dong, Xin et al. 2014). LOX-expression and secretion is increased in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and hypoxia, suggesting that LOX may contribute towards an IR-induced migratory phenotype in sublethally-irradiated tumor cells and tumor progression; therefore LOX inhibitors can be used in combination with radiotherapy to reduce side effects in surrounding tissues receiving a reduced radiation dose (Shen, Sharma et al. 2014). LOX and LOXL2 inhibition can alter vascular permeability or normalise vasculature in a tumour environment, which can enhance the delivery or effectiveness of drugs (Ingber and Mammoto 2014) (Marshall, Spangler et al. 2012), for example improved efficacy of treatment in ovarian xenograft and lung allograft mice models with chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol (Zaffryar-Eilot, Marshall et al. 2013). Pharmacological inhibition of lysyl oxidases improved drug delivery and reversed the negative effect of VEGF ablation on drug delivery and therapeutic response in anti-VEGF-resistant tumors (Roehrig et al, 2017). The extracellular matrix has been proposed to have an important role in the resistance to chemotherapeutics. It has been shown that inhibition of LOX for cells grown in collagen (as a surrogate of ECM) reverses their collagen-dependent increased resistance to chemotherapeutics such as erlotinib, cisplatin or methotrexate (Smith and Holzer 2010). Drug diffusion and efficacy is reduced by the enzymatic action of LOX and LOXLs on the ECM in a 3D cell culture (not in 2D) and sensitivity to doxorubicin and paclitaxel can be restored by inhibition with BAPN (Schuetze, Roehrig et al. 2015). LOX inhibition synergized with gemcitabine to kill tumors and significantly prolonged tumor-free survival in a pancreatic mouse model. This was associated with stromal alterations and increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into tumors. Therefore, targeting LOX could improve outcome in surgically resectable disease (Miller, Morton et al. 2015).

### Synthesis

In the description of the synthetic methods described below and in the referenced synthetic methods that are used to prepare the staring materials, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, can be selected by a person skilled in the art.

It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reaction conditions utilised.

Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry.

The preparation of such starting materials is described in conjunction with the following representative process variants and within the accompanying Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.

It will be appreciated that during the synthesis of the compounds of the invention in the processes defined below, or during the synthesis of certain starting materials, it may be desirable to protect certain substituent groups to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed.

For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example, ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley & Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with the minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.

Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.

By way of example, a suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl or trifluoroacetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed by, for example, hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example BF3.OEt2. A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.

A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium, sodium hydroxide or ammonia. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.

A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.

Resins may also be used as a protecting group.

**I. General Method for the Preparation of Bridged Piperidin-4-Ones Derivatives**

**Method A**

A solution of the aniline (1 to 1.2 eq.), 2-cyclohexen-1-one (1.6 to 2.5 eq.), L- or D-proline (0.3 eq.) and 37% aqueous formaldehyde (1 eq.) in dimethylsulfoxide (1 to 2.5 M) was stirred at rt or 50° C. for up to 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate then washed with water and brine.

The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a gradient of methanol in ethyl acetate (or a gradient of ethyl acetate in cyclohexane or a gradient of ethyl acetate in dichloromethane) to give the two separate regioisomers. In some cases, the regioisomers could not be separated and were used in the next step as a mixture.

In a first step, to a mixture of ketone Ala (1 eq.) in anhydrous dichloromethane (or toluene) (0.05 to 0.5 M) and molecular sieves (3 to 4 Å, 0.5 to 15 g) was added benzylamine (1 to 1.1 eq.) followed by para-toluene sulfonic acid (hydrate form) or acetic acid (catalytic amount) or no acid catalyst. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 4 to 48 h then filtered through glass wool to remove the molecular sieves. The solution containing the imine was cooled (−78° C. to 0° C.) and a solution of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (1 to 1.7 eq.) in anhydrous dichloromethane (or toluene) (0.1 to 0.7 M) added dropwise. The reaction was stirred at this temperature until completion then quenched with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate and an aqueous solution of metal carbonate or metal hydrogen carbonate (10% to saturated) and water. The phases were separated and the organic phase extracted with dichloromethane (or toluene). The combined organic phases were washed successively with 10% aqueous metal hydrogen carbonate solution, brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a gradient of ethyl acetate in cyclohexane affording the oxaziridine as a mixture of diastereoisomers (9:1 to 1:1). Alternatively the major oxaziridine diastereoisomer may be recrystallised from a suitable solvent system such as ether/hexane.

In a second step, photochemical rearrangement of the oxaziridine was achieved under continuous flow conditions. A solution of the oxaziridine in cyclohexane (or acetonitrile or ether) (0.5 to 6 g·L−1) was thoroughly degassed with nitrogen (or argon) then pumped (flow rate: 0.2 mL/min to 10 mL/min) through UV-transparent tubing (Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene tubing is preferred) including a section irradiated with a broad-spectrum UV or UV-C light source, and then collected at the outlet. Continuous operation demonstrated mass flow rates of up to 8 g per day. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and recycled affording a mixture of regioisomers of bridged homopiperazinones in ratios of 5.9:1 to 9:1. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient of ethyl acetate in cyclohexane.

## Materials and Methods

### Cell Culture and Transfection

All cell lines used in this study were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Mycoplasma contamination was routinely monitored by PCR. Cells used were not found to be Mycoplasma positive. MDCK cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin solution (Pen Strep). For GFP constructs transfection in MDCK cells, lipofectamine 3000 was used according to manufactures protocols. Cells were either selected with G418 (Life Technologies) at 5 mg/ml. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies.

To produce MDCK cysts, cells were cultured on Matrigel (Corning) with 2% Matrigel supplemented in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cysts were allowed to form for 10 days before subsequent studies.

Cloning of LOX expression constructs

Mouse LOX cDNA was purchased from OriGene. Full length LOX cDNA was then PCR cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech), or biosensor vector proGFP2-N1 (Hanson, 2004) using the following primers, GAGAGAGCTAGCATGCGTTTCGCCTGGG (forward primer) and TCTCTCCTCGAGATACGGTGAAATTGTGCAGCC (reverse primer). For the insertion into pEGFP-N1 or proGFP2-N1, NheI and XhoI restriction sites were added to forward and reverse primers accordingly. Mutant LOX constructs were made using QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) following manufacture's protocol using LOX-GFP as template. To generate, roGFP2 versions of LOX mutant constructs, LOX mutant cDNA was transferred from pEGFP-N1 to proGFP2-N1 using NheI and XhoI.

### Confocal Imaging and Imaging Analysis

All photomicrographs were taken with a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal system. For LOX biosensor imaging, live MDCK cysts were used. The oxidised biosensor was excited using a 405 nm laser, while the reduced biosensor was excited with a 488 nm laser. Emission of the biosensor was recorded at 500 nm-530 nm range using sequential scans. Ratio images were generated following a published protocol {Kardash, 2011#376}. Note, while the published protocol generates YFP/CFP ratio images, we used it to generate Oxidised/Reduced (roGFP2 ratio) ratio images. The roGFP2 ratio at the basal surface of MDCK cysts was used to indicate LOX inhibition. LOX inhibitors were added 30 min prior to imaging.

The inhibition of LOX in cysts assay by LOX inhibitors as compared to control (DMSO vehicle treated) cysts is shown in Table 1. For clarity, readout for DMSO treated cysts represents 0% inhibition (no inhibition) and readout for BAPN at 1 mM is used as 100% inhibition (full inhibition).

### Animal Procedures

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body of the Institute of Cancer Research and Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute in accordance with National Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and according to the guidelines of the Committee of the National Cancer Research Institute Tumour size was determined by caliper measurements of tumour length, width and depth and volume was calculated as volume=0.5236×length×width×depth (mm). In accordance with our licence to perform animal experiments, animals were excluded from the experiments if they displayed signs of distress, excessive bodyweight loss (>20%) or illness.

### Oral Tolerability of LOX Inhibitors

Two CD1, NCR or Balb/c female mice at 6 weeks of age were dosed po by metal gavage once a day for 4 consecutive days with suspension of the test compound at the dose planned for therapy (200 mg/kg/day) in 5.25% Tween20/saline (v:v) or 5% DMSO in water at 0.2 ml per 20 g bodyweight.

The mice were observed for up to 15 days after last dose and their bodyweight measured every 4 days. A compound is considered tolerated if the bodyweight does not fall by >20% for over 72 hrs.

Compounds of this invention tested in vivo show good tolerability at the dose tested and exhibit <5% bodyweight loss or show bodyweight gain in the tolerability study and in further longer therapy studies.

### In Vivo Tumour Models Studies

PDAC allografts: CD1 nu/nu female mice at 6 weeks of age were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 2×106 PDAC TRP53 R172H (p53 mut) cells at 100 ul suspension per animal. In some examples, the oral dosing by metal gavage commences one day after cells inoculation, at 0.2 ml/20 g bodyweight per animal once daily for 2-4 weeks, with compound dissolved in 5.25% tween20/saline or 5% DMSO/water. In other examples, groups of 7-8 mice were assigned to treatment following stratified allocation of tumour volumes with a median size of circa 100 mm3. Oral dosing by metal gavage commenced around day 10, at 0.2 ml/20 g bodyweight per animal once daily for 2 weeks, with compound dissolved in 5.25% tween20/saline or 5% DMSO/water. Control animals received a similar dosage of vehicle (5.25% tween20/saline). Tumours and weights are measured twice weekly using calipers. At the end of the study the animals are culled, and samples taken, fixed or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples kept at −80 degree centigrade until being analysed and the fixed samples stained according to the desired marker.

SW620 xenografts: NCr mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×106 SW620 cells at 100 ul suspension per animal. Groups of 7-8 mice were assigned to treatment following stratified allocation of tumour volumes with a median size of circa 100 mm3. Dosing commenced around day 10-13 at 0.2 ml/20 g bodyweight per animal once daily for 2 weeks. Dosing was administrated orally by metal gavage, at 0.2 ml/20 g bodyweight, compound dissolved in 5.25% tween20/saline or 5% DMSO/water. Control animals received a similar dosage of vehicle (5.25% tween20/saline or 5% DMSO/water). Tumours and weights are measured twice weekly using calipers. At the end of the study the animals are culled, and samples taken, fixed or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples are kept at −80 degree centigrade until being analysed and the fixed samples stained according to the desired marker.

MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Ncr nude female mice at 6 weeks old from Charles River were injected into the third upper nipple mammary fat pad with MDA-MB-231 Luc 4×10{circumflex over ( )}6 in 100 ul PB (50:50 Matrigel). When tumours reach a mean of 80 mm3 around 10 days post cell inoculation the animals are allocated in 4 groups of 8. LOX inhibitor treatment is then administrated by oral gavage dosing, at 0.2 ml/20 g bodyweight once daily for up to 28 consecutive days. Tumours and weights are measured twice weekly using calipers and the animals can be imaged using non invasive method by bioluminescence using IVIS 200 imaging machine, weekly using 150 mg/kg luciferin administrate intraperitoneal or subcutaneous. At the end of the study the animals are culled, and samples taken, fixed or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples kept at −80 degree centigrade until being analyzed and the fixed samples stained according to desired marker.

### LOX Inhibitor Treatment of a Transgenic Mouse Breast Cancer Model

MMTV-PyMT (Guy et al, 1992) (FVB) female mice were randomized by non-statistical methods to LOX inhibitor treatment groups from day 70 post-birth, when animals had no detectable tumour. Mice were treated daily by oral gavage with LOX inhibitor in vehicle, or daily vehicle (5% DMSO/2.5% Tween20 in water) by oral gavage. Tumour size was determined unblinded by caliper measurements of tumour length, width and depth and volume was calculated as 0.5236×length×width×depth (mm). In all experiments, mice were humanely killed and mammary tumours and lungs were collected when the primary tumours reached ethical limits or signs of ill health.

For therapeutic efficacy assessment, the ratio of average tumour volume between compound treated and vehicle control treated (T/C) is calculated. Reduction in tumour volume in the compound treated group compared to vehicle-treated control group results in T/C<1. The efficacy of LOX inhibitors described in this invention, as measured by T/C in a pancreatic cancer model, a colorectal cancer model and a breast cancer model is shown in Table 2 and is significant (p<0.05) for all the data presented.

For lung metastases quantification, all mouse tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma) and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained. Samples were imaged with a Leica SCN400 slide scanner. Lung metastases were manually selected using Pen tool in ImageScope. Lung metastases number was counted and area was measured using ImageScope. The investigator was blinded to the experimental groups. The ratio of average metastases surface between compound treated and vehicle control treated (T/C) is calculated. The ratio of average metastases numbers between compound treated and vehicle control treated (T/C) is also calculated. Reduction in metastases area and/or in metastatses number in the compound treated group compared to vehicle-treated control group results in T/C<1. The antimetastatic efficacy of LOX inhibitors described in this invention, as measured by T/C in a model of breast cancer metastasising to lungs is shown in Table 2 and is significant (p<0.05) for all the data presented.
