                    "paragraphs": [
                        "LOX (protein-6-lysine-oxidase; EC 1.4.3.13) is an extracellular enzyme that catalyses oxidative deamination of the primary amines of lysine and hydroxylysine in proteins such as collagen and tropoelastin to generate peptidyl-[a]-aminoadipic-[8]-semialdehyde, an aldehyde that spontaneously condenses to form inter- and intra-chain cross-links (Lucero and Kagan 2006). LOX regulates maturation of proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby contributing to ECM tensile strength and function and so playing an important role in connective tissue remodelling. Other proteins have been reported as substrates for oxidation by LOX, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, PDGFR-13 and other cationic proteins (Kagan and Li 2003, Li, Nugent et al. 2003, Lucero and Kagan 2006, Lucero, Ravid et al. 2008).",
                        "LOX is secreted as a precursor protein that is proteolytically processed by procollagen C-proteinases (bone morphogenetic protein 1\u2014BMP-1) and mammalian tolloid-like protein (mTLL-1) (Uzel, Scott et al. 2001) to generate an 18 kDa pro-peptide and the 32 kDa active LOX enzyme (Lucero and Kagan 2006). The catalytic domain contains copper and a lysine-tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor. LTQ is formed by post-translational oxidation of a catalytic site tyrosine (Tyr349), which then condenses onto a lysine, also within the catalytic site (Lys314), to form a stable covalent modification that is an essential part of the catalytic mechanism (Lucero and Kagan 2006) (Kagan and Li 2003).",
                        "LOX is part of a protein family consisting of five paralogues, LOX, LOX-like 1 [LOXL1], LOX-like 2 [LOXL2], LOX-like 3 [LOXL3] and LOX-like 4 [LOXL4]), all containing a conserved catalytic region. LOX enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining ECM stability, by initiating and regulating the crosslinking of collagens and elastin within the extracellular matrix (ECM). The activity of these enzymes is key to maintaining the normal tensile and elastic features of connective tissue of many organ systems within the body. LOX expression decreases during ageing indicating that its activity is especially important during development.",
                        "In addition to its role in tissue remodelling, LOX also plays a critical role in primary cancer and metastasis. Studies have shown that LOX plays a fundamental role in the growth of primary tumours in colorectal and lung cancer (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010, Baker, Cox et al. 2011) and glioblastoma (Mammoto, Jiang et al. 2013).",
                        "Expression of LOX is elevated in more than 70% of breast cancer patients with Estrogen Receptor negative disease, in 80% of head & neck cancer patients, in 33% of primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and 48% of metastatic tissues from patients with CRC (Baker, Cox et al. 2011), and in cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with a history of alcoholism (Huang, Ho et al. 2013). As discussed in more detail in the description, LOX is also overexpressed in numerous other cancers including lung, prostate and pancreatic cancers.",
                        "Elevated LOX expression is also associated with metastasis and decreased patient survival (Baker, Cox et al. 2011, Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011)",
                        "Other members of the LOX family have been implicated in proliferative diseases such as cancer. LOXL2 is another member of the LOX family that is involved in the cross-linking of extracellular collagens and elastin (Vadasz, Kessler et al. 2005) (Kim, Kim et al. 2010). In addition to conserved C-terminal region, the LOXL2 protein has scavenger receptor cysteine-rich regions that are commonly found in cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as a cytokine receptor-like domain.",
                        "LOXL2 expression has been found upregulated in breast, gastric, colon, esophageal, head and neck, lung and laryngeal carcinomas, as reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012) and in renal cells carcinoma (Hase, Jingushi et al. 2014) (Nishikawa, Chiyomaru et al. 2015).",
                        "Studies have suggested that LOX and LOXL2 do not compensate one another, as manipulation of LOX expression did not affect LOXL2 levels in a colorectal cancer model (Baker, Cox et al. 2011). Thus while LOX and LOXL2 are involved in similar extra-cellular processes, it appears that they have distinct roles.",
                        "LOXL1 was found to be overexpressed in metastatic non-small cells lung cancer (NSCLC), and the metastatic phenotype can be reduced by inhibition with LOXL1 siRNA (Lee, Kim et al. 2011).",
                        "LOXL3 mRNA was expressed in Hs578T highly invasive breast cancer cells, but not in poorly invasive and non-metastatic breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002). Overexpression of LOXL3 in MDCK epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is a key step in the progression of metastasis (Peinado, Del Carmen Iglesias-de la Cruz et al. 2005).",
                        "In a study on the mRNA levels of LOXL4 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, high expression of LOXL4 gene was detected in 71% of all carcinomas and only in 9% of the healthy mucosa samples, indicating that LOXL4 may serve as a selective molecular marker in primary and metastatic head and neck carcinoma (Scola and Gorogh 2010). Up-regulation of LOXL4 was demonstrated in invasive HNC and revealed a significant correlation between LOXL4 expression and local lymph node metastases and higher tumour stages (Goeroegh, Weise et al. 2007). LOXL4 promotes metastasis in gastric cancer (Li, Zhao et al. 2015). LOXL4 together with LOXL2 has been found to be required for metastatic niche formation in a breast orthotopic mouse model (Wong, Gilkes et al. 2011).",
                        "LOX and LOXL are implicated in fibrotic diseases, such as liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, myelofibrosis and schleroderma. Both LOX and LOXL are highly expressed in fibrotic areas, in surrounding myofibroblasts and in serum of patients with fibrotic conditions (Kagan 1994) (Kim, Peyrol et al. 1999) (Siegel, Chen et al. 1978) (Jourdan-Le Saux, Gleyzal et al. 1994) (Murawaki, Kusakabe et al. 1991).",
                        "LOX is also implicated in cardiovascular disease. As discussed in the detailed description of the invention, LOX inhibition may prove beneficial in the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertensive heart disease, heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis.",
                        "LOX is associated with the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) related pathological hallmarks (such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and senile plaques) of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) pathogenesis (Wilhelmus, Bol et al. 2013). LOX activity is increased in the hippocampal samples of Alzheimer's disease and also in non-Alzheimer's dementia (Gilad, Kagan et al. 2005). LOX is increased at the site of brain injury (Gilad, Kagan et al. 2001) and spinal cord injury and its inhibition lead to accelerated functional recovery in an unilateral spinal cord dissection model (Gilad and Gilad 2001).",
                        "LOXLs are implicated in pulmonary diseases. LOXL2 and LOXL3 are likely to have a role in Primary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) since both are expressed in PAP tissue, but not normal lung tissue (Neufeld and Brekhman 2009).",
                        "LOX inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of various ocular conditions. Inhibition of LOX or LOXL2 prevents neovascularization and fibrosis following laser-induced chloroidal neovascularization (CNV). Therefore LOX and LOXL inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of conditions characterized by neovascularization, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (Stalmans, Marshall et al. 2010).",
                        "LOX is implicated in inflammatory conditions and may be useful in the treatment of conditions including, but not limited to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Mambetsariev, Tian et al. 2014).",
                        "LOX is the main isoenzyme expressed in human adipose tissue and that its expression is strongly upregulated in samples from obese patients. \u03b2-aminopropionitrile reduces body weight gain and improves the metabolic profile in diet-induced obesity in rats (Miana, Galan et al. 2015) and reduces local adipose tissue inflammation (Halberg, Khan et al. 2009).",
                        "LOX is upregulated in endometriosis and may be implicated in the establishment and progression of endometriotic lesions (Ruiz, Dutil et al. 2011) (Dentillo, Meola et al. 2010).",
                        "Certain LOX inhibitors are known. These include \u03b2-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), haloamines, 1,2-diamines, ally) and propargyl amines, hydrazines, semicarbazide and thiolactones, benzylamines, mercaptopyridine and pyridazinone compounds (Pinnell and Martin 1968) (Tang, Simpson et al. 1984) (Palfreyman, McDonald et al. 1989) (Sayre 2007) (Carrington, Bird et al. 1984) (Levene, Sharman et al. 1992) (Liu, Nellaiappan et al. 1997) (Williamson and Kagan 1987) (Anderson, Bartlett et al. 2007) (Schohe-Loop, Burchardt et al. 2003) (Burchardt 2006, Aslam, Miele et al. 2015). However, in general these compounds are either non-selective, lack potency or are unsuitable for use in patients. It is believed that the only LOX inhibitor which has progressed to clinical trials in humans is BAPN. However, it is believed that this compound has not been used clinically since 1978. More recent LOX and LOXL2 inhibitors have been described: LOX inhibitors containing hydrazine and hydrazide groups (Burke et al, 2017); LOXL2 inhibitors: derivatives of haloallylamine (Chang et al, 2017), pyridines (Rowbottom et al, 2016a; Rowbottom et al, 2016b), pyrimidines (Rowbottom & Hutchinson, 2017a) and chromenones (Rowbottom & Hutchinson, 2017b).",
                        "There is therefore a need for new LOX inhibitors."

PDAC KRASmut/p53wt cells (which endogenously express low levels of LOX) were engineered to express high levels of human LOX. In murine allograft models using these cells primary tumour growth is increased significantly (Miller, Morton et al. 2015). Lysyl oxidase activity participates in primary tumor growth in a transgenic mouse model of aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by directly impacting the senescence stability (Wiel, Augert et al. 2013).",

LOX is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011), LKB1-mutant lung cancer (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010), aggressive prostate adenocarcinoma (Stewart, Gray et al. 2008), uveal melanoma (Abourbih, Di Cesare et al. 2010), oral and oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma (Albinger-Hegyi, Stoeckli et al. 2010), thyroid cancer (Boufraqech, Nilubol et al. 2015), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Vitalba et al, 2016), myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially myelofibrosis (Papadantonakis, Matsuura et al. 2012, Tadmor, Bejar et al. 2013) and pancreatic cancer (Sansom 2012, Miller, Morton et al. 2015).",

In addition to conserved C-terminal region, the LOXL2 protein has scavenger receptor cysteine-rich regions that are commonly found in cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, as well as a cytokine receptor-like domain.",
                                "LOXL2 expression has been found upregulated in breast, gastric, colon, esophageal, head and neck, lung and laryngeal carcinomas, as reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012) and in renal cells carcinoma (Hase, Jingushi et al. 2014) (Nishikawa, Chiyomaru et al. 2015). High LOXL2 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, laryngeal, oesophagus and breast cancer, increased metastases in colon and breast cancer, as well as drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells\u2014reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012). Additionally, it has been shown that LOXL2 up-regulation increases the invasiveness of otherwise non-invasive breast cancer cells (Akiri, Sabo et al. 2003). Furthermore, LOXL2 and LOXL4 are required for metastatic niche formation in a breast orthotopic mouse model (Wong et al, 2011).",

HCC metastasis relies on LOXL2, which is overexpressed in tumor tissues and sera of HCC patients (Wong, Tse et al. 2014).",
                                "LOXL2 transcription is regulated by HIF-1 and upregulation of LOXL2 in hypoxia has been shown to downregulate E-cadherin leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Schietke, Warnecke et al. 2010) which is a key step in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis. This is in agreement with other reports where LOXL2 was shown to be involved in both EMT and tumour progression in murine squamous and spindle cell carcinomas (Fong, Dietzsch et al. 2007) (Moreno-Bueno, Salvador et al. 2011). LOXL2 expression is positively associated in CRC (Offenberg, Brunner et al. 2008). LOXL2 has also been linked to Src kinase/focal adhesion kinase (Src/FAK) pathway activation, and this appears to be the major pathway where secreted LOXL2 induces gastric tumour cell invasion and metastasis (Peng, Ran et al. 2009).",
                                "In certain cancers such as basal-like breast carcinoma and larynx squamous cell carcinoma perinuclear expression of LOXL2 is a marker of tumour aggressiveness and poor prognostic (Moreno-Bueno, Salvador et al. 2011) (Peinado, Moreno-Bueno et al. 2008).",

                                "Elevated LOX expression is associated with metastasis and decreased patient survival (Baker, Cox et al. 2011, Wilgus, Borczuk et al. 2011) Increased LOX expression is associated with disease grade, increased distant metastasis and lower overall survival in breast cancer patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumours (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006), in head & neck cancer patients (Albinger-Hegyi, Stoeckli et al. 2010, Toustrup, Sorensen et al. 2011), gastric cancer (Kasashima, Yashiro et al. 2015), hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhu, Huang et al. 2015), non-small cells lung cancer (Liu, Ping et al. 2014) and astrocytomas (da Silva, Uno et al. 2015), laryngeal cancer (Se, 2017). LOX expression is a determinant of poor survival in pancreatic cancer (Miller, Morton et al. 2015). Inhibition of LOX eliminates metastasis in mice with orthotopically grown human breast cancer (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006) and inhibits tumour angiogenesis in a human colorectal cancer model (Baker, Bird et al. 2013).",
                                "A polyclonal antibody that was raised against LOX and shown to inhibit its enzymatic activity, was able to block the metastatic spread of tumour cells to the lungs and livers of recipient mice in an orthotopic model of metastatic human breast cancer (Erler et al, 2006). Suppression of LOX expression using shRNA blocks metastatic spread of the breast cancer cells and that BAPN, the non-selective small molecule inhibitor of LOX can block metastatic tumour growth of these cells in mice (Erler et al, 2006). Furthermore, inhibition of tumour-secreted LOX by genetic (shRNA), antibody (Ab) or the irreversible non-selective small molecule inhibitor BAPN, significantly reduced invasion and metastasis of orthotopic human breast tumours or circulating human breast cancer cells (Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009, Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009, Levental, Yu et al. 2009), CRC (Baker, Cox et al. 2011), HCC (Huang, Ho et al. 2013), LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (Gao, Xiao et al. 2010), anaplastic thyroid cancer (Boufraqech, Nilubol et al. 2015) and PDAC in mice (Sansom 2012; Miller, Morton et al. 2015). High expression of LOX in primary breast tumours leads to osteolytic lesion formation; silencing or inhibition of LOX activity abrogates tumour-driven bone metastases (Cox, Rumney et al. 2015). LOX inhibition with BAPN and new inhibitor CCT365623 significantly reduce metastatic lung tumour burden in a mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer that metastasizes to the lungs (Tang et al, 2017).",
                                "LOX family members (especially LOX and LOXL2) play a critical role in the metastatic spread of cancer cells (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006, Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009, Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009, Levental, Yu et al. 2009, Gao, Xiao et al. 2010). In response to hypoxia (a condition that occurs due to inadequate blood supply when solid tumours exceed about 1 cm3 in size), cancer cells produce and secrete LOX into the circulation (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009).",
                                "LOX regulates invasion of cancer cells in vitro. Thus, cancer cells expressing high levels of LOX show increased ability to invade 3D collagen I and Matrigel matrices (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Furthermore, experimental over-expression of LOX enhances invasion of cancer cells, whereas genetic knock-down of LOX using RNA interference (RNAi; with both short hairpin RNA [shRNA] or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) or antisense technology) inhibits the in vitro invasion activity of cancer cells (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Similarly, a non-selective small molecule inhibitor of LOX, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) also blocks the in vitro invasion activity of several human cancer cell lines (Kirschmann, Seftor et al. 2002) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). LOX enhances hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in cervical cancer cells mediated by the EMT which can be inhibited by BAPN (Yang, Li et al. 2013). These studies implicate LOX in the invasive behaviour of cancer cells.",
                                "One of the critical functions of LOX appears to be to act remotely to pre-condition the niche at future sites of metastasis. Tumour cell metastasis is facilitated by these \u201cpremetastatic niches\u201d formed in destination organs using invading bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). This \u201cnest-building\u201d activity is initiated when LOX becomes deposited at discreet sites in the target organ (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009). Studies have shown that bone marrow derived cell recruitment is an essential step in niche conditioning and metastatic spread of cancer (Kaplan et al, 2005). This mechanism underlines the importance of LOX for the invasive activity of cancer cells and for the earliest stages of metastasis, when the cancer cells first migrate out of the primary tumour. It has been shown that BMDCs and LOX co-localise in human metastatic tissue, and inhibition of LOX can prevent BMDC recruitment and metastasis in models of breast cancer metastasis (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009).",
                                "In addition to its roles in the early phases of metastasis, there is evidence that LOX is necessary to maintain the growth of the cancer cells once they arrive at the new metastatic sites because inhibition of LOX causes regression of these lesions, even after the development of metastatic disease (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006) (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009) (Bondareva, Downey et al. 2009). It was shown that although depletion of LOX does not affect tumour cell proliferation on plastic, it suppresses their growth in recombinant basement membrane (Matrigel) matrices (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Furthermore, cancer cells do not colonise the lungs efficiently when LOX is inhibited by shRNA (Erler et al, 2006) and it was found that metastatic lung tumours regress when mice are treated with LOX neutralising antibodies (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). Notably, the colonisation of the lung by human breast cancer cells was enhanced when the cells were co-injected with conditioned medium from cells expressing LOX, but this was blocked if the mice were treated with conditioned medium in the presence of BAPN or a LOX antibody (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2009). These findings demonstrate a requirement for tumour-secreted LOX to maintain metastatic growth.",
                                "LOX is essential for phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) downstream of integrin signalling (Erler, Bennewith et al. 2006). FAK is a tyrosine kinase that interacts with several signalling molecules and is critical for cell survival (van Nimwegen and van de Water 2007). LOX-mediated collagen cross-linking results in increased tissue stiffness and activation of the FAK/SRC signalling in in vitro and in vivo models of CRC. Cells expressing high levels of enzymatically active LOX have an increased capacity to proliferate, invade and metastasise. Thus LOX have both cell-dependent and cell-autonomous roles in metastatic tumour growth at several levels: enhances the ability of cancer cells to invade locally, possibly by enhancing migration away from the primary site; conditions the future metastatic sites in preparation for the arrival of the BMDCs and then tumour cells; supports the survival/proliferation of the cancer cells once they colonise the niche.",

Persistent presence of myofibroblasts in cancer contributes to desmoplasia, a cancer-specific type of fibrosis. Desmoplasia and increased fibrosis have been associated with progression of several cancers such as breast, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric and hepatocellular (Barker, Cox et al. 2012). Desmoplasia is also an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in stromally-rich tumours (Zhao and Subramanian, 2017). LOX and LOX family members have an essential role in extracellular matrix remodelling and desmoplasia (Levental, 2009; Xiao, 2012). Lysyl oxidase family members expression, either secreted by cancer cells or by activated fibroblasts, has been found associated with tumour ECM, tumour stroma or tumour-associated vasculature of several cancers, such as colorectal, pancreatic, breast, laryngeal, endometrial, testicular, hepatocellular, renal (reviewed in Barker et al (Barker, Cox et al. 2012)), gastric cancer (Kasashima, Yashiro et al. 2014), and to be involved in their progression and metastasis (Akiri, Sabo et al. 2003, Barry-Hamilton, Spangler et al. 2010, Barker, Bird et al. 2013) (Pickup, Laklai et al. 2013).

Such a test will inform the clinician whether the patient is likely to respond to LOX inhibition therapy or not, and enable the clinician to commence alternative therapy if the patient is predicted to be unlikely to respond. This will benefit the patient by targeting their treatment with an appropriate therapy early, rather than relying on the current \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach. Such a test will therefore enable better of targeting of LOX inhibition therapy to patients early in their disease, when maximum effect can be achieved, and may result in greater access to these drugs as they are used in a more cost-efficient manner.",

                                "LOX inhibition can be a useful method for improving the efficacy of other drugs or addressing resistance to drug treatment through a number of mechanisms. Specific inhibition of LOX with siRNA can induce apoptosis of laryngeal cancer Hep-2 cells and enhance the sensitivity of Hep-2 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin (Dong, Lu et al. 2014) and to radiation (Dong, Xin et al. 2014). LOX-expression and secretion is increased in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and hypoxia, suggesting that LOX may contribute towards an IR-induced migratory phenotype in sublethally-irradiated tumor cells and tumor progression; therefore LOX inhibitors can be used in combination with radiotherapy to reduce side effects in surrounding tissues receiving a reduced radiation dose (Shen, Sharma et al. 2014). LOX and LOXL2 inhibition can alter vascular permeability or normalise vasculature in a tumour environment, which can enhance the delivery or effectiveness of drugs (Ingber and Mammoto 2014) (Marshall, Spangler et al. 2012), for example improved efficacy of treatment in ovarian xenograft and lung allograft mice models with chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol (Zaffryar-Eilot, Marshall et al. 2013). Pharmacological inhibition of lysyl oxidases improved drug delivery and reversed the negative effect of VEGF ablation on drug delivery and therapeutic response in anti-VEGF-resistant tumors (Roehrig et al, 2017). The extracellular matrix has been proposed to have an important role in the resistance to chemotherapeutics. It has been shown that inhibition of LOX for cells grown in collagen (as a surrogate of ECM) reverses their collagen-dependent increased resistance to chemotherapeutics such as erlotinib, cisplatin or methotrexate (Smith and Holzer 2010). Drug diffusion and efficacy is reduced by the enzymatic action of LOX and LOXLs on the ECM in a 3D cell culture (not in 2D) and sensitivity to doxorubicin and paclitaxel can be restored by inhibition with BAPN (Schuetze, Roehrig et al. 2015). LOX inhibition synergized with gemcitabine to kill tumors and significantly prolonged tumor-free survival in a pancreatic mouse model. This was associated with stromal alterations and increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into tumors. Therefore, targeting LOX could improve outcome in surgically resectable disease (Miller, Morton et al. 2015).",

The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed by, for example, hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example BF3.OEt2.

Emission of the biosensor was recorded at 500 nm-530 nm range using sequential scans. Ratio images were generated following a published protocol {Kardash, 2011#376}. Note, while the published protocol generates YFP/CFP ratio images, we used it to generate Oxidised/Reduced (roGFP2 ratio) ratio images.
