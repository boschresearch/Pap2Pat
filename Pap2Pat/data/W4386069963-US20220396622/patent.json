                        "Biologics, such as antibodies and antibody-based molecules, represent attractive candidates as diagnostic tools and therapeutics (Reichert, mAbs, Vol. 5(1), pp. 1-4 (2013)). To date, more than 70 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for and successfully applied in diverse indication areas including cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease.",
                        "The Fc region of an antibody, i.e., the C-terminal portion of the heavy chains of an antibody that spans domains CH2, CH3 and a portion of the hinge region, is involved in effecting the physiological roles played by the antibody. The effector function attributable to the Fc region of an antibody varies with the class and subclass of antibody and includes binding of the antibody via the Fc region to a specific Fc receptor (\u201cFcR\u201d) on a cell which triggers various biological responses. FcRs are expressed in a variety of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells. Upon Fc binding to FcRs, effector cells are recruited, resulting in subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability of an antibody to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which the antibody destroys targeted cells.",
                        "The receptors for the Fc region of IgGs are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins comprising three different receptor types having different binding specificities: Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII (Hulett and Hogarth (Hulett, M. D. and Hogarth, P. M., Adv. Immunol. 57 (1994) 1-127)). Engagement of the Fc region of IgGs with these Fc\u03b3Rs governs antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). In humans, the Fc\u03b3R protein family includes Fc\u03b3RI (CD64); Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, and Fc\u03b3RIIC; and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIIB (Raghavan and Bjorkman, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 12 (1996) 181-220; Abes, et al., Expert Reviews (2009) 735-747). Some Fc\u03b3Rs are activating receptors, e.g., Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA/C, and Fc\u03b3RIIIA, characterized by an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), whereas other Fc\u03b3Rs are inhibitory receptors, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIB, containing an inhibitory motif (ITIM). Likewise, the affinity of the Fc\u03b3Rs also vary: Fc\u03b3RI binds monomeric IgG with high affinity, whereas Fc\u03b3RIII and Fc\u03b3RII are low-affinity receptors, interacting with complexed or aggregated IgG. Another type of IgG Fc receptor is the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is structurally similar to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and consists of an \u03b1-chain noncovalently bound to \u03b22-microglobulin.",
                        "In certain situations, it can be advantageous to decrease or eliminate antibody effector function, e.g., an antibody is intended to engage cell surface receptors and prevent receptor-ligand interactions (antagonists) and/or preventing antibody-drug conjugates from interacting with Fc\u03b3Rs leading to off-target cytotoxicity. IgG binding to Fc\u03b3Rs depends on residues located in the hinge region positions 233-239 (EU numbering) and the CH2 domain. IgG binding to C1q has also been reported to involve CH2 domain residues, e.g., positions 318, 320, 322, and 331 (Duncan and Winter (Nature 332:738-40 (1988); Tao et al., J. Exp. Med., 178:661-667 (1993); Brekke et al., Eur. J Immunol., 24:2542-47 (1994)) and lower hinge region residues (Alegre et al., J Immunol. 148:3461-3468 (1992); Xu et al., Cell Immunol. 200:16-26 (2000); WO1994/29351). A number of IgG Fc region variants comprising amino acid substitutions in these regions are known in the art (see e.g., Oganesyan, et al., Acta Cristallographica D64 (2008) 700-704, disclosing L234F/L235E/P331S; WO2012/130831 (Roche), disclosing L234A/L235A/P329G; WO2015/077891 (Zymeworks), providing a review of other known modifications to reduce Fc\u03b3R or complement binding to the Fc in Table C (e.g., GSK\u2014N297A; Ortho Biotech\u2014L234A/L235A; Protein Design Labs\u2014IgG2 V234A/G237A; Wellcome Labs\u2014IgG4 L235A/G237A/E318A; GSK\u2014IgG4 S228P/L236E; Alexion\u2014IgG2/IgG4combo; Merck\u2014IgG2 H268Q/V309L/A330S/A331S; Bristol-Myers\u2014C220S/C226S/C229S/P238S; Seattle Genetics\u2014C226S/C229S/E323P/L235V/L235A; Medimmune\u2014L234F/L235E/P331S; Trubion\u2014Hinge mutant, possibly C226S/P230S).",
                        "Substitution of human IgG1 and IgG2 residues at positions 233-236 and IgG4 residues at positions 327, 330 and 331 has been shown to significantly reduce ADCC and CDC by disrupting Fc\u03b3R and C1q binding, respectively (see, e.g., Armour, et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 29(8) (1999) 2613-2624 and Shields, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(9) (2001) 6591-6604). For example, the triple mutation L234F/L235E/P331S has been shown to decrease binding activity to C1q, Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Oganesyan, et al., Acta Cristallographica D64 (2008) 700-704). Substitutions at positions 234 and 235 of the lower hinge region alone and in combination with substitutions in the CH2 domain at P329 have also been reported in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821 (SB2 Inc.) disclosing inter alia L234A and L235E; U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,969,526 and 10,093,714 (Roche) disclosing P329G or R and L234A/L235A; U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,624 (Genentech) disclosing P329A; Idusogie et al., J. Immunol. (2000) 164:4178-4184, disclosing P329A prevents C1q interaction). While P329A was reported to have no effect on Fc binding to Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RII receptors and only a very small decrease in Fc binding to the Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptor (see Table 1 and Table 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,624), the same substitution was conversely shown, by a different group, to reduce binding to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIIIA receptors (Shields, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(9):6591-6604 (2001)). P329G was reported to inhibit Fc binding to Fc\u03b3Rs and, thus, was selected for combination with L234A and L235A to provide a variant Fc with reduced effector function, whereas P329A was once again shown to exhibit wildtype-like (or near) binding to Fc\u03b3Rs and, accordingly, deemed an unfavorable mutation for reducing effector function (see U.S. Pat. No. 8,969,526). Therefore, while much effort has gone in to engineering a \u201csilent\u201d Fc region, there is still a need for antibodies with strongly decreased effector function."

A \u201cvariant Fc\u201d refers to an Fc region that has been modified relative to a parent Fc region. A variant Fc may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising a modification at one or more amino acid positions in the Fc region. Such modifications include substitution of a wild-type amino acid at a particular position, i.e., 234, 235 and 329, or replacement of the amino acid at each of these positions to the amino acid residues specified herein, i.e., 234A+235A+329A or 234A+235E+329G, in the Fc region. The \u201cFc region\u201d is a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that spans the domains CH2, CH3, and a portion of the hinge region. A human IgG heavy chain Fc region can extend from Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) of the Fc region may or may not be present. \u201cLower hinge\u201d of the Fc region refers to amino acid residues found from about position 230 to about position 237.

For the IgG class of antibodies, ADCC and ADCP are governed by engagement of the Fc region with a family of receptors referred to as Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs). In humans, this family includes Fc\u03b3RI (CD64); Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, and Fc\u03b3RIIC; and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), including isoforms Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIIB (Raghavan, and Bjorkman, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 12 (1996) 181-220; Abes, et al., Expert Reviews 5(6), (2009) 735-747). ADCC activity may be determined using any number of methods known in the art including flow-cytometry-based assays (e.g., Wilkinson et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 256(1-2), (2001) 183-191), an ADCC-reporter gene assay based on key attributes of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based assays (e.g., Parekh, et al., MABS 4(3), 2012 310-318), 51Cr release assays (e.g., Perussia et al., Methods Mol.

                        "\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d (CDC) refers to the mechanism by which antibody-coated target cells recruit and activate components of the complement cascade, leading to the formation of a Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) on the cell surface and subsequent cell lysis. The CDC mechanism is mediated by Fc binding to the complement protein C1q. C1q is a polypeptide that includes a binding site for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1q, together with two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, forms the complex C1, the first component of the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. CDC activity may be determined using any number of methods known in the art including cell viability assays using redox dyes like Alamar blue (e.g., Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 202(2), (1997) 163-171), viability assays using fluorescent labels like carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinymyl ester and 70amino-actinomycin D (e.g., Sawada et al., Clin Cancer Res, 17(5), (2011) 1024-1032), and 51Cr release assays (e.g., Kato et al., Oncotarget, 6(34), (2015) 36003-36018).",
                        "In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that an antibody lacks Fc\u03b3R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity) but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC (e.g. NK cells), express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is taught in Ravetch et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest are described in: U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 82:1499-1502 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assay methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTI\u2122 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (Cell Technology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.); and CytoTox 96\u00ae non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.)). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Also, ADCC activity may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that an antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M. S. et al. Blood. 101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, et al., Blood 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half-life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, et al. Int'l. Immunol 18(12):1759-1769 (2006)).",

Testing for reduced FcR binding included measuring THP-1 cell binding as well as binding affinities for Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIIA Additional developability tests were conducted (e.g., PSR, pH stress, Tm, etc.) to verify that these substitutions did not have developability issues. Lower hinge substitutions LALA and LALE were found to significantly reduce FcR binding and both displayed good developability profiles.",
                        "Results showed that LALA+P329A (\u201cLALA-PA\u201d) and LALE+P329G (\u201cLALE-PG\u201d) substitutions significantly reduced FcR and C1q binding while maintaining FcRn binding and maintaining good developability profiles. In some embodiments, the LALA-PA variant or the LALE-PG variant reduce affinity for each of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIIA by greater than 95% as compared to a polypeptide comprising a wild-type human Fc region. In some embodiments, the LALA-PA or LALE-PG substitutions reduce affinity for each of Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIIIA by at least about 100%, at least about 99%, at least about 98%, at least about 97%, at least about 96%, at least about 95%, at least about 94%, at least about 93%, at least about 92%, at least about 91%, at least about 90%, and/or all percentages in between, compared to a wildtype Fc region. In some embodiments, the LALA-PA or LALE-PG substitutions reduce affinity for C1q by at least about 100%, at least about 99%, at least about 98%, at least about 97%, at least about 96%, at least about 95%, at least about 94%, at least about 93%, at least about 92%, at least about 91%, at least about 90%, at least about 89%, at least about 88%, at least about 87%, at least about 86%, at least about 85%, at least about 84%, at least about 83%, at least about 82%, at least about 81%, at least about 80%, at least about 79%, at least about 78%, at least about 77%, at least about 76%, at least about 75%, at least about 74%, at least about 73%, at least about 72%, at least about 71%, at least about 70%, and/or all percentages in between, compared to a wildtype Fc region. In one embodiment, LALE-PG reduces affinity for C1q by about 75%. In another embodiment, LALA-PA reduces affinity for C1q by about 80%. These substituted combinations provide superior reduction of Fc function compared to previously known amino acid substitution combinations. For example, the LALE-PG substitutions provide a larger reduction in binding to THP-1 compared to LALA-PG (Roche, U.S. Pat. No. 8,969,526), and the LALA-PA substitutions provided a larger reduction in binding to C1q compared to LALA-PG (see Table 1).",

For binding to analytes Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, FcRn and C1q, a streptavidin (SA) sensor chip immobilized (35 RU) with a biotinylated-CD3 peptide was used to capture (450 RU) the IgGs of interest. Upon IgG capture, the interaction between each individual analyte and the IgG was measured by flowing the analyte solutions (100 nM for Fc\u03b3RI; 1 \u03bcM for Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, FcRn and C1q) over flow cells. Dissociation of the bound analytes were measured by flowing instrument running buffer over flow cells for 3-5 minutes. Binding to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and C1q were performed at pH 7.4, while binding to FcRn was performed at pH 6.0. The resulting sensorgrams were double reference subtracted using the Biacore Evaluation software version 1.0. Relative binding responses (Late Association Response measured in resonance units (RU)) near the end of the analyte binding step were recorded for each interaction. Table 2 summarizes the binding responses for wild-type and each Fc variant. FIG. 3 shows exemplary binding data for LALA-PA compared to LALA-PG, LALA, and WT. FIG. 4 shows exemplary binding data for LALE-PG compared to LALE-PA, LALE, and WT.

Further, the LALA-PA variant reduced binding of some Fc\u03b3Rs compared to LALA alone (e.g., Fc\u03b3RI: 2.2 RU vs 23.5 RU). Results also show that the P329G substitution in combination with LALE significantly reduced binding of Fc\u03b3Rs and C1q compared to WT (Fc\u03b3RI: 0.8 RU vs. 92 RU (99.1% reduction); Fc\u03b3RIIA: 0 RU vs. 4.8 RU (100% reduction); Fc\u03b3RIIIA: \u22120.3 RU vs. 9.8 RU (100% reduction); C1q: \u22126.5 RU vs. 155.7 RU (100% reduction)).
