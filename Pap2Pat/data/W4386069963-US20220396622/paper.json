    "title": "Profiling the Biophysical Developability Properties of Common IgG1 Fc Effector Silencing Variants",
    "date": "2023-08-22",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies represent the most significant modality in biologics, with around 150 approved drugs on the market. In addition to specific target binding mediated by the variable fragments (Fvs) of the heavy and light chains, antibodies possess effector functions through binding of the constant region (Fc) to Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), which allow immune cells to attack and kill target cells using a variety of mechanisms. However, for some applications, including T-cell-engaging bispecifics, this effector function is typically undesired. Mutations within the lower hinge and the second constant domain (CH2) of IgG1 that comprise the Fc\u03b3R binding interface reduce or eliminate effector function (Fc silencing) while retaining binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), important for normal antibody pharmacokinetics (PKs). Comprehensive profiling of biophysical developability properties would benefit the choice of constant region variants for development. Here, we produce a large panel of representative mutations previously described in the literature and in many cases in clinical or approved molecules, generate select combinations thereof, and characterize their binding and biophysical properties. We find that some commonly used CH2 mutations, including D265A and P331S, are effective in reducing binding to Fc\u03b3R but significantly reduce stability, promoting aggregation, particularly under acidic conditions commonly employed in manufacturing. We highlight mutation sets that are particularly effective for eliminating Fc effector function with the retention of WT-like stability, including L234A, L235A, and S267K (LALA-S267K), L234A, L235E, and S267K (LALE-S267K), L234A, L235A, and P329A (LALA-P329A), and L234A, L235E, and P329G (LALE-P329G).",

                "Therapeutic antibodies are widely used in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases [1]. Antibodies, which belong to a class of therapeutic drugs termed biologics, have favorable properties including highly specific and high-affinity binding to targets (i.e., low or no specific off-target binding), a long serum half-life, and the ability to trigger immune responses, termed effector functions. However, these effector functions can also cause unintended adverse effects, including inflammation, tissue damage, and cytotoxicity. In particular, T cell-engaging bispecifics benefit from abrogation of effector functions [2]. Therefore, there has long been interest in developing antibodies with reduced effector functions that maintain their antigen-binding capacity and other important drug-like properties [3]. This approach is known as \"effector function modulation\" or \"silencing\" and is achieved through various strategies, such as modification of the Fc region, alteration of glycosylation patterns, and engineering of the antibody structure. These modifications can significantly impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibodies, including their serum half-life, clearance, and tissue distribution. Thus, reducing effector function in IgG1 antibodies has the potential to enhance their safety and efficacy in the clinical setting.",
                "Human immune cells express four activating Fc\u03b3Rs: Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RIIa (CD32a), Fc\u03b3RIIc (CD32c), and Fc\u03b3RIIIa (CD16a) [4], which bind to the hinge and upper CH2 domains of Fc [5]. These receptors mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) [6]. IgG recycling, which contributes to a long half-life, is mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) [7]. FcRn binding to Fc is pH dependent, with stronger binding observed under the acidic conditions (<pH 6.5) present in the endosome [8]. The Fc also engages the complement system, a component of the innate immune pattern recognition system that functions to destroy targeted cells through activation of the C1 complex, which triggers a cascade that leads to cell lysis known as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In the classical pathway, C1 activation is initiated by the binding of the complement C1q heterotrimer to the Fc, which recruits the proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex [9]. C1 then converts to C3, which ultimately forms C3a and C3b. Finally, of importance to antibody manufacturing at a large scale is the ability to bind protein A (ProA), a bacterial protein with nM affinity for the Fc. Pro affinity chromatography is the first step in the purification of an antibody from culture supernatant [10].",
                "IgG subclasses differ in their binding affinity to Fc\u03b3Rs and complement [11]. As such, IgG2 and IgG4 have been used to reduce Fc effector function when ADCC and CDC are not desired [12]. However, one drawback of this strategy is that IgG2 and IgG4 show increased sensitivity to acid-induced aggregation [13], with IgG4 having a significantly lower melting temperature (Tm) and higher onset pH threshold for aggregation [14,15]. An ideal silent IgG1 Fc would possess the following properties: no binding to activating Fc\u03b3R and C1q, retention of binding to FcRn and Protein A (ProA), and biophysical properties non-inferior to wild-type IgG1 (Figure 1). The mapping of Fc\u03b3R-Fc contact residues in IgG1 and the availability of crystal structures has provided functional insights and atomic level description that comprise a comprehensive picture of relevant molecular interactions that enable rational engineering approaches [16][17][18][19][20]. These structure-function studies establish the lower hinge, particularly L234 and L235, and P329, as the primary binding site of Fc\u03b3Rs [17,21,22]. Additional secondary interactions are mediated by residues in the vicinity of the CH2 glycan at N297, which also makes some contacts (EU numbering) [17,[21][22][23][24][25]. The binding site for C1q overlaps that of Fc\u03b3R [26], whereas the binding sites for FcRn and Protein A localize to the CH2-CH3 junction [27,28]. CH2 residues D270, K322, P329, and P331 have been identified as critical to the interaction between human IgG1 antibodies and C1q [29][30][31].",
                "Early efforts to generate a silence Fc began with modification of the lower hinge, utilizing mutations L234A/L235A (LALA) [32] and L234A/L235A/G237A (LALAGA) [33], which showed a reduction in but not the complete elimination of effector functions. Subsequent combinations of hinge and CH2 modifications lead to a significant reduction in or the total elimination of function with preservation of FcRn and ProA binding. These mutation sets can be conceptually divided into approaches that retain the N297 glycan, exemplified by P331S [34], L234A/L235A-P329G (LALA-PG) [35], L234F/L235E-P331S (LFLE-PS) [22], L234F/L235E-D265A (LFLE-DA) [36], and others [37][38][39], and those that remove it, such as N297A [40], N297G [41], R292C/N297G/V302C [42], and others.",
                "In this work, we set out to characterize the binding and biophysical developability of commonly used Fc silencing mutation sets. We produced and evaluated mutations in the lower hinge and CH2 of the IgG1 anti-CD3\u03b5 antibody ADI-26906 [43]. We observed that S267K, P329G, and P329A mutations combined with lower hinge mutations LALA and LALE completely eliminated binding to Fc\u03b3R under the conditions of the assays and retained WT-like biophysical properties. In contrast, D265A and P331S combined with the same hinge mutations increase acid-induced aggregation. Sensitivity to pH stress in general was observed to correlate with reduced CH2 melting temperature (Tm).",
                "dues in the vicinity of the CH2 glycan at N297, which also makes some contacts (EU n bering) [17,[21][22][23][24][25]. The binding site for C1q overlaps that of Fc\u03b3R [26], whereas the b ing sites for FcRn and Protein A localize to the CH2-CH3 junction [27,28]. CH2 resi D270, K322, P329, and P331 have been identified as critical to the interaction between man IgG1 antibodies and C1q [29][30][31]. A disulfide bonded hinge region between CH1 to CH2 flexibly links these domains. The light chain is composed of a variable light and constant light domains of isotype kappa (\u03ba) or lambda (\u03bb). Antigen binding is mediated by the VH and V\u03ba (for a kappa isotype antibody, as shown), together referred to as the variable fragment (Fv). The constant fragment (Fc) mediates binding to Fc\u03b3R, complement, FcRn, and ProA. Residues strongly associated with binding to Fc\u03b3R and complement are listed. (bottom) The hinge and CH2 domain sequences of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses are shown, with differences in amino acids indicated in red font and differences in length marked by dashes."

                        "Lower hinge substitutions were incorporated into the anti-CD3 IgG1 antibody ADI-26906. These substitutions were derived from literature, clinical, and marketed molecules: L234A/L235A (LALA) [32], L234F/L235E (LFLE) [22], L234A/L235E (LALE) [39], L235A/G237A (LAGA1), L234A/G237A (LAGA2), and L234A/L235A/G237A (LALAGA) [33]. Derivatives representing a charge flip (L235K) were also explored, including L234A/L235K (LALK), L234F/L235K (LFLK), and L234E/L235K (LELK), to assess the impact of a positive charge in the lower hinge.",
                        "The mutation sets are enumerated in Table 1. All variants were produced in HEK cells by transient transfection and purified by ProA. Biophysical properties were profiled using a panel of established assays. In brief, polyspecificity reagent (PSR) binding was characterized by a FACS-based assay and reported as a normalized binding score [3,45]. Self-interaction propensity was characterized by affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy (AC-SINS) and reported as maximum wavelength shift (\u2206max\u03bb) [49]. Hydrophobicity was characterized by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and reported as retention time (min) [50]. Finally, antibody quality was characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reported as monomer content (%). Overall, the biophysical properties profiled were largely unaffected by lower hinge substitutions (Table 1). However, a significant impact was observed for L235K-containing hinge variants, which appear to slightly increase Fc Tm but negatively impact low pH stability, as assessed by the pH 3.5 stress assay. The lower hinge variants were tested for binding to Fc\u03b3R using a FACS-based cell binding assay. THP-1 cells express Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RII (Figure S1), and binding of WT IgG1 is readily observable under standard conditions of 100 nM IgG labeling. All of the lower hinge variants reduced binding by approximately one order of magnitude, comparable to the level of WT IgG2 and in agreement with expectations [11]. No impact on binding of the variants to CD3\u03b4\u03b5 was observed by Octet BLI (Table S1)."

                        "CH2 substitutions were incorporated into LALA and LALE lower hinge variants of the anti-CD3 IgG1 antibody ADI-26906. The mutation sets are enumerated in Table 2. As with the lower hinge, mutations were derived from literature, clinical, and marketed molecules. The panel comprises D265A [53], S267K [37,54], H268Q [55], D270A [29], Y296F [56], L309A [19], L309V, K322A [39], A327G [37], L328A [57], P329A [29], P329G [35], A330S [58], A330S/P331S [32], and P331S [22]. Variants H268Q, L309V, A330S and P331S are derived from IgG4. Biacore SPR kinetics measurements were used as the first screen to evaluate affinity for FcRn, Fc\u03b3Rs, and C1q (Figure 2 and Table 2). For the FcRn experiments, the antibody variants were oriented by binding to the immobilized biotinylated CD3 peptide on the streptavidin sensor chip surface (Figure 2A). FcRn binding was retained in most variants. Only L309A negatively affected affinity for FcRn, as previously reported [19], whereas L309V has no effect. Binding to Fc\u03b3Rs utilized a different format: the capture of antibody variants with a goat anti-human Fc antibody immobilized to the CM5 sensor chip surface through amine coupling (Figure 2A). CD64 was most strongly reduced by D265A, S267K, P329G, and P329A, with LALE offering slightly more reduction than LALA (Table 2). This pattern is similar for CD32a and CD16; however, the low binding response for these weaker interactions makes the relative loss of binding more difficult to assess. C1q binding was observed only for WT IgG1, with both LALA and LALE hinge mutations ablating binding under the conditions of the assay.    In order to assess binding to Fc\u03b3Rs on the surface of the cells, the THP-1 cells were labeled under standard (uncomplexed IgG) and highly avid conditions (Figure 3 and Table 2). Pre-complexing of the antibody with BSA multiply conjugated with the CD3 peptide (CD3-BSA PC) produced an approximately dodecavalent immune complex for the high avidity labeling of THP-1 cells. Both LALA and LALE were sufficient to reduce binding to THP-1 cells close to background under standard conditions, but these lower hinge variants still retained significant binding under the more sensitive antibody immune complex condition (Figure 3A,B and Table 2). Only D265A, S267K, P329G and P329A mutations eliminated binding under the CD3-BSA PC binding condition (Figure 3B and Table 2 In order to assess binding to Fc\u03b3Rs on the surface of the cells, the THP-1 cells were labeled under standard (uncomplexed IgG) and highly avid conditions (Figure 3 and Table 2). Pre-complexing of the antibody with BSA multiply conjugated with the CD3 peptide (CD3-BSA PC) produced an approximately dodecavalent immune complex for the high avidity labeling of THP-1 cells.

Only D265A, S267K, P329G and P329A mutations eliminated binding under the CD3-BSA PC binding condition (Figure 3B and Table 2).  Given the inability to distinguish C1q binding among the variants in the panel by SPR, as with the cell-based Fc\u03b3R binding assay, a more sensitive FACS-based experiment was developed. In brief, the antibody is bound to the biotinylated CD3 peptide immobilized to SA Dyna Beads, followed by incubation with C1q alone and C1q together with human complement (C3) [59]. C1q was detected with anti-human C1q APC secondary, and C3 was detected with anti-human C3 PE (BD Biosciences). The assay identified D270A, K322A, P329G, P329G, P331S, and S267K as having the largest impact on the reduction in binding to C1q (Figure 3C,D), consistent with published observations [29].",
                        "As with the lower hinge-only variants, no impact on binding to CD3\u03b4\u03b5 was observed by Octet BLI (Table S2). In addition, the retention of binding to ProA was preserved for the entire panel (Table S2).",
                        "Biophysical properties were profiled by PSR, AC-SINS, HIC, DSF Tm, SEC, and pH 3.5 stress SEC (Table 3). The PSR variation among the panel was 0.33 (WT)-0.43 (LALA-L309A). The HIC retention time was unchanged for the entire panel, implying that hydrophobicity was not impacted. Increases in self-interaction propensity assessed by AC-SINS were evident for LALA combinations with D270A and L309V, and LALAGA-P329G, which yielded maximal wavelength shifts more than double that of WT. Overall there was somewhat greater variation among the combination panel than for lower hinge substitutions alone. The most significant deviations from WT-like properties were observed for DSF Tm and pH 3.5 stress SEC (\u2206% monomer), reflecting changes in stability. The DSF Tm assay reports the lowest value associated with a thermal transition event, attributed to the unfolding of the CH2 domain. WT IgG1 has a Tm of 67.  2). The pH 3.5 stress SEC assay measures aggregation propensity under acidic conditions, reported as \u2206% monomer. D265A shows a 9.6% and 11.3% increase in aggregates in combination with LALA and LALE, respectively, compared with WT (Table 2 and Figure S2). L328A, P331S, and A330S/P331S also show increases in aggregates ranging from 3.1-8.6 when combined with LALA and LALE. Thus, variants that significantly reduced CH2 Tm generally also showed increased propensity to form aggerates under acidic conditions (Figure 4 and Table 3). The single exception is LALE-P331S, which forms fewer aggregates (1.6% increase over WT) than LALA-P331S (3.2% increase over WT).",

The DSF Tm assay reports the lowest value associated with a thermal transition event, attributed to the unfolding of the CH2 domain. WT IgG1 has a Tm of 67.5 \u00b0C under the standard conditions of this assay. CH2 mutations associated with the largest reduction in DSF Tm are D265A (63.0 \u00b0C), L328A (63.0 \u00b0C), and P331S (62.5 \u00b0C) in combination with LALA and D265A (62.0 \u00b0C), L328A (62.0 \u00b0C), P331S (60.5 \u00b0C), and A330S/P331S (61.0 \u00b0C) in combination with LALE (Table 2).

                "IgG1 antibodies that display biophysical properties similar to WT while possessing silenced effector function have clear benefits for the manufacturing process. One key aspect of this is resistance to acid-induced aggregation, which can become an issue during the low pH hold routinely employed for viral inactivation [60]. The alternative use of detergent is less straightforward and may affect yield to a greater extent than low pH [61]. While stabilizing mutations for IgG4 are known [62], IgG1 has significantly higher representation in marketed therapeutic antibodies; approximately 59% are IgG1 whereas IgG2 and IgG4 comprise 7% and 21%, respectively [63]. This may reflect a more straightforward manufacturing process and the favorable developability and functional profile of IgG1.",
                "LALA-P329G is among the most prevalent mutation sets in clinical use, represented by alnuctamab, cergutuzumab, cibisatamab, glofitamab (approved), simlukafusp, melredableukin, englumafusp, eciskafusp, tobemstomig, lomvastomig, forimtamig, and simaravibart. In contrast to LALA-P329G, LALA-P329A has not been well studied and the specific combination LALE-P329G in this work has not been previously described. A study reporting the effect of introducing LALA, P329G, and P329A mutations examined the combination of LALA with P329G but not with P329A, based on the rationale that P329G and P329A could be distinguished under certain conditions [35]. Using both SPR and cell-based assays, including highly avid formats, we found that LALA-P329A and LALE-P329G perform very similarly to LALA-P329G in terms of completely abolishing effector function, under the conditions of the assays tested here, with the retention of stability and biophysical developability profile. LALA-S267K and LALE-S267K also appear to work quite well. In contrast, while LALA-D265A, LALE-D265A, LALA-P331S, and LALE-P331S show reduced Fc (CH2) Tm and increased propensity for acid-induced aggregation. This"
