                        "A technical innovation in a structural biology field has deepened understanding of relationship between a structure of a protein and a function thereof, and has led to development of an innovative drug based on the structure of the protein. In an X-ray crystallographic structure analysis of the protein, crystallization of the protein is an essential step. Crystallization takes place through a process in which a crystal nucleus is formed in a supersaturated solution, and a process in which the crystal nucleus grows to a crystal.",
                        "An obstacle to the structural analysis resides in the crystallization step. Upon performing crystallization of a protein of which crystallization conditions are unknown, search for the crystallization conditions first becomes essential. The search for protein crystallization conditions contains a first screening and a second screening. The first screening contains a step of searching for physical conditions and chemical conditions for the purpose of determining conditions, by an extensive search for conditions of crystallization of a target protein, under which the target protein starts crystallization. In this step, for example, protein concentration, kind and a concentration of precipitant, kind of a buffer solution and pH thereof, and the like effective to crystallization are assessed to find out conditions allowing the crystallization to start. On the other hand, the second screening contains a step of searching for elaborated physical conditions and chemical conditions for the purpose of determining final conditions for crystallization of the target protein by modifying the crystallization start conditions selected through the first screening. Modification of the crystallization start conditions in the second screening is performed by partially changing the physical conditions and the chemical conditions constituting the crystallization start conditions or by selectively adding new physical conditions and chemical conditions that are not included in the crystallization start conditions. For example, finally optimum crystallization conditions, specifically, conditions for obtaining a single crystal having a larger possible size with a high quality are found out by finely adjusting conditions such as the concentration of the precipitant and the pH of the buffer solution, or by using an additive or a surfactant that is not used in the first screening, and also by finely adjusting the kind, the concentration or the like thereof. In any of these screenings, a trial-and-error examination of conditions is required for a limitless number of combinations of physical conditions and chemical conditions according to the target protein. For example, the second screening is performed through many kinds of examinations for conditions, such as kind of precipitant, pH of a solution, concentration of a protein solution, and temperature thereof. Crystals obtained after determining the crystallization conditions are subjected to a structural analysis by X-ray irradiation. Before irradiation with X-rays, the crystals may be occasionally immersed into an antifreeze containing a cryoprotectant. Moreover, when omission of the immersion step is desired, protein crystallization is tried using a precipitant solution containing the cryoprotectant in the first screening or the second screening. In any case, each screening is repeated until a desired crystal is obtained.",
                        "However, a protein is not generally active in forming crystal nuclei, and therefore hard to cause crystallization. In addition thereto, conditions of crystallization of a new protein cannot be anticipated at all, and new crystallization conditions cannot be anticipated even to a protein in which crystallization conditions are known, either. Under such a situation, the conventional first screening sometimes did not result in formation of crystals or even crystalline precipitates, and could not determine crystallization start conditions. Depending on the protein crystallization conditions, presence or absence of crystal nucleation is changed by a slight change of setting conditions, such as a solvent and temperature. Therefore, the conventional second screening that is the modification of the crystallization start conditions as selected in the first screening sometimes yielded no crystal. Control of protein crystal nucleation by the modification of setting conditions such as the solvent or the temperature is difficult. Therefore, the conventional second screening inclined to result in no crystal formation at a desired size and in the number of pieces. Moreover, the conventional second screening resulted in no crystal formation under conditions referred to as a metastable region in which supersaturation conditions are less than the crystallization start conditions, and in which no crystal nucleation takes place but crystal growth potentially takes place. When protein crystals are formed in the metastable region, the crystal inclines to have a sufficiently high quality, as is well known in the art. The cryoprotectant suppresses the protein crystal nucleation. Therefore, use of a reagent containing the cryoprotectant in the first screening and the second screening inclined to cause no protein crystallization. As described above, the conventional screening system inclined to yield no objective crystals or waste the protein being a precious sample after all even with an examination of conditions in which a load is high. Accordingly, a development has been required for a simple, economical and highly reliable method for searching for protein crystallization conditions.",
                        "In response thereto, an attempt was proposed for improving efficiency of protein crystallization by using a layered silicate. Patent Literature 1 discloses a screening chip for searching for protein crystallization conditions by using a layered silicate, in which the silicate is applied in the form of a film onto a support. However, the layered silicate described in Patent Literature 1 has a problem of not sufficiently promoting crystal nucleation of extensive proteins in screening on the assumption of searching for conditions of crystallization of various proteins. Moreover, the film is not a thin uniform film, and therefore is likely to be easily detached. Furthermore, the invention described in Patent Literature 1 requires a user of the screening chip to select an optimum type of the layered silicate and an amount of layered silicate application. Such an examination of conditions causes consumption of a large amount of protein solution. Moreover, the silicate is present in a part in which the screening chip and the protein solution are not in contact with each other. Therefore, extensive penetration of the protein solution inclines to decrease a degree of supersaturation and to cause protein denaturation.",
                        "Patent Literatures 2 and 3 disclose an agent for controlling protein crystal formation by using a layered silicate, and a method for controlling the formation using the same. However, the layered silicates described in Patent Literatures 2 and 3 also promotes only insufficient protein crystal nucleation in screening in a manner similar to the layered silicate described in Patent Literature 1. Moreover, the layered silicate described in Patent Literatures 2 and 3 has a weak surface negative charge and low water-swelling properties. Therefore, the layered silicate inclines to agglomerate and precipitate when the layered silica comes in contact with a screening reagent containing a precipitant at a high concentration.",
                        "Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses an agent for controlling lysozyme crystal formation containing a fluorine-containing layered silicate. Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses use of the layered silicate in lysozyme crystallization. However, no description is made on use of the layered silicate on the assumption of searching for conditions of crystallization of various proteins. Moreover, the layered silicate described in Non-Patent Literature 1 also insufficiently promotes the crystal nucleation of the protein in screening.",
                        "Non-Patent Literature 2 discloses an agent for controlling protein crystal formation that contains fluorine mica. This fluorine mica is synthesized by a solid-state reaction process, by using talc as a starting material, in the absence of moisture. However, the fluorine mica described in Non-Patent Literature 2 has no hydroxyl group. Therefore, crystal nucleation rate cannot be adjusted, and crystal nucleation is not promoted in some cases. Therefore, the fluorine mica is insufficient for an agent for searching for crystallization conditions. Moreover, the fluorine mica is non-swelling in water, and therefore inclines to agglomerate or precipitate in contact with a reagent containing a precipitant at a high concentration. Accordingly, use of the fluorine mica for a dispersion liquid needs agitation for uniformly dispersing the fluorine mica.",

As a result, the present inventors created an agent to search protein crystallization conditions that contains a water-swellable layered silicate having a fluorine atom and a hydroxyl group, in which the fluorine atom is covalently bonded to the silicate by isomorphous substitution with the hydroxyl group. More specifically, the present inventors found that a molar percent of the fluorine atom to the hydroxyl group of the layered silicate relates to the protein crystal formation, and can control the crystal formation rate and the probability of the crystal formation. According to the present invention, the present inventors found that a protein can be crystallized even under conditions in which the protein could not be sufficiently crystallized so far. Furthermore, the present inventors found that a strong surface negative charge of the water-swellable layered silicate having the fluorine atom, and excellent water-swelling properties thereof contribute to improvement in operability of the agent for searching for protein crystallization conditions.

The layered silicate, when the layered silicate is brought into contact with a protein, forms an aggregate of the protein functioning as a crystal nucleus. The layered structure, the fluorine atom, and the hydroxyl group of the layered silicate can promote the protein crystal nucleation. The fluorine atom and the water-swelling properties of the layered silicate provide the agent for searching for crystallization conditions with a uniform dispersibility and film-forming properties. The agent for searching for crystallization conditions according to the present invention is suitable for searching for crystallization conditions for crystallization of a protein in an amount from a nanogram unit to a microgram unit.",
                        "The agent for searching for crystallization conditions may be constituted of the layered silicate only, or a mixture of the layered silicate and any other component. Specific examples of the other component include pure water, a precipitant, a buffering agent, an additive, an organic solvent, and a mixed component of these components. The agent for searching for crystallization conditions may contain a single or a plurality of layered silicates.",
                        "The layered silicate used for the agent for searching for crystallization conditions according to the present invention is not particularly limited. Preferred examples thereof include montmorillonite, talc, phlogopite, mica, kaolin, chlorite, pyrophyllite, vermiculite, endellite, chrysotile, beidellite, halloysite, nontronite, sericite, dickite, antigorite, hectorite (fluorine hectorite), sauconite, kanemite, makatite, octosilicate, magadiite, kenyaite, stevensite and saponite. More preferred examples include mica, montmorillonite, stevensite, hectorite and saponite; and particularly preferred examples include saponite.",
                        "Specific examples of the layered silicate include a natural product or a synthetic product. The natural product may contain an impurity. However, the impurity is preferably removed from a viewpoint of stringent control of crystallization in nucleation. The synthetic product is highly pure, in which isomorphous substitution efficiency thereof can be freely controlled during synthesis. Accordingly, stringent control in nucleation is allowed.",
                        "The layered silicate may have an arbitrary mean particle diameter. The mean particle diameter is preferably 2 to 50 \u03bcm from a viewpoint of uniform dispersibility. The mean particle diameter may be determined by measurement of a laser-type particle size distribution using water as a dispersion medium.",
                        "The layered silicate may have arbitrary cation exchange capacity. The cation exchange capacity is preferably at least 10 meq/100 g, and further preferably at least 60 meq/100 g. The cation exchange capacity in a suitable range provides the layered silicate with a negative charge suitable for nucleation promotion.",
                        "A specific surface area of the layered silicate is preferably from 1 to 1,000 m2/g, more preferably from 10 to 500 m2/g, and further preferably from 100 to 200 m2/g. The specific surface area provides the layered silicate with surface charge density suitable for nucleation promotion.",
                        "The layered silicate has water-swelling properties, and therefore is hard to cause spontaneous precipitation in a reagent containing a precipitant at a high concentration. Accordingly, such a layered silicate allows provision of a dispersion liquid type agent that is used for searching for crystallization conditions, and has improved uniform dispersibility, long-term stability of a uniform dispersion state, and redispersibility. Moreover, the water-swellable layered silicate has excellent film-forming properties. Therefore, such a layered silicate allows provision of a uniform and thin film-like agent for searching for crystallization conditions.",
                        "The layered silicate is preferably of a smectite group. The smectite group has a 2:1 layered structure. Use of the smectite group allows provision of an agent for searching for crystallization conditions that has improved uniformity and operability.",
                        "The layered silicate is further preferably saponite, among the smectite group. Saponite has a layered structure in which a silicon atom in a tetrahedron layer is replaced by an aluminum atom, and therefore has a permanent negative charge.",
                        "Saponite provides the agent for searching for crystallization conditions with properties for nucleation promotion resulting from a mesopore. Use of saponite allows promotion of further diversified protein crystal nucleation in the form of a single product, and allows provision of improved uniformity and operability for the agent for searching for crystallization conditions.",
                        "With regard to the layered silicate, any bonding form is allowed to the hydroxyl group. For example, the layered silicate may have the hydroxyl group bonded in the form of a covalent bond. Alternatively, the layered silicate may have a hydroxyl group-containing compound directly or indirectly bonded thereto.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the hydroxyl group is covalently bonded in a crystal structure of the layered silicate. The layered silicate having the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group adsorbs a protein in a protein solution, and forms protein aggregates functioning as a crystal nucleus. Moreover, a molar percent of each of the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group can be controlled by an amount of addition of a charged fluorine raw material during synthesis.",
                        "The fluorine atom is covalently bonded in the crystal structure of the layered silicate by isomorphous substitution. Moreover, the layered silicate formed by isomorphous substitution of the fluorine atom has a relatively large cation exchange capacity. Therefore, such a layered silicate increases a surface charge density of the layered silicate. Accordingly, the layered silicate into which the fluorine atom is introduced by isomorphous substitution adsorbs a protein with a high density in a protein solution to effectively form protein aggregates functioning as the crystal nucleus.",
                        "Moreover, the permanent negative charge of the layered silicate further increases by allowing isomorphous substitution of the fluorine atom, in comparison with the charge of the layered silicate without isomorphous substitution, to allow a strong electrostatic repulsion to act between particles of the layered silicate. Accordingly, the agent for searching for crystallization conditions is hard to aggregate even in contact with the reagent containing a precipitant at a high concentration, and has improved uniformity.",
                        "The layered silicate having the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group can be synthesized by an ordinary method. Specific examples of the synthetic method include a hydrothermal synthetic process, a fusion synthetic process, a high-pressure synthetic process, a solid-state reaction process, a flame fusion process, and a transformation process. Among these, a hydrothermal synthesis using a fluorine source is preferred. The hydrothermal synthesis using a fluorine source easily allows introduction of the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group into a product by isomorphous substitution. Moreover, the layered silicate having the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group may be synthesized by a high-pressure synthetic process, a solid-state reaction process, a flame fusion process or a transformation process, each using a fluorine source. Furthermore, the layered silicate having the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group may be synthesized by introducing a hydroxyl group into fluorine-containing layered silicate.",
                        "A molar percent of the fluorine atom to the hydroxyl group in the layered silicate influences a success rate of protein crystallization, a rate of crystallization, crystal nucleus density, and a size of crystals. In particular, a positive correlation is present between the molar percent of the fluorine and a frequency of nucleation, and a negative correlation is present between the molar percent of the fluorine atom and the size of crystals. The fluorine content and the molar percent of the fluorine atom to the hydroxyl group may be quantitatively determined and calculated by means of an X-ray fluorescence system (RIX 1000, manufactured by Rigaku Corporation) by using layered silicate from which free fluorine and a soluble ion are washed and removed by dispersing a synthesized sample into distilled water, and then performing filtration or centrifugation several times.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, a molar percent of the fluorine atom for the total of the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group in the layered silicate is preferably from 3% to 15%, further preferably from 4% to 12%, and most preferably from 5 to 10%. Moreover, a molar percent of the hydroxyl group is preferably from 85% to 97%, further preferably from 88% to 96%, and most preferably from 90% to 95%. In this range, the layered silicate has a nucleation promotion effect, and therefore allows improvement in the success rate of crystallization in the first screening using the agent for searching for crystallization conditions. Moreover, the success rate of crystallization, the rate of crystal formation, the size of crystals, and the crystal nucleus density can be controlled by appropriately adjusting the molar percents. If the molar percent of the fluorine atom in the agent for searching for crystallization conditions is too low (the molar percent of the hydroxyl group is too high), the layered silicate does not effectively promote crystal nucleation, and therefore desired crystals cannot be occasionally obtained in the first screening and the second screening. Moreover, if the molar percent of the fluorine atom is too high (the molar percent of the hydroxyl group is too low), the size of crystals occasionally becomes small or high-quality crystals for X-ray diffraction or the like cannot be occasionally obtained. Herein, when the crystallization start conditions selected through the first screening using the agent for searching for crystallization conditions according to the present invention already allows formation of desired protein crystals, the second screening may be skipped. Moreover, when the crystallization start conditions are already found out, the agent for searching for crystallization conditions according to the present invention may be applied only to the second screening.",

In a preferred embodiment, the agent for searching for crystallization conditions includes a dispersion liquid agent prepared by adding powder layered silicate to a dispersion medium, or a thin film-like solid agent prepared by applying layered silicate onto a support. A dispersion liquid agent of water-swellable layered silicate having the fluorine atom is hard to aggregate and precipitate in a reagent containing a precipitant or the like at a high concentration. The thin film-like solid agent allows improvement in operability in searching for crystallization conditions because preparation of a dispersion liquid is unnecessary.",
                        "Any support may be used for carrying the thin film-like solid agent. Preferred examples thereof include a cover glass, a slide glass, a plate, a bridge, or a rod.

Specific examples of the solid agent include powder, granules, a thick film, a thin film, a tablet, and a freeze-drying agent. The thick film-like or thin film-like solid agent may be a free-supporting film, or a film carried on a support. The thick film-like or thin film-like agent for searching for crystallization conditions has improved operability because no agitation is necessary at all. Furthermore, the thick film-like or thin film-like agent for searching for crystallization conditions has improved uniformity due to absence of foam formation even when a surfactant-containing reagent is used.

The thin film-like solid agent has further improved uniformity and operability. The thin film is preferably formed only on a part in contact with the protein on the support.

The thus-obtained product (1 L) after the hydrothermal synthesis was subjected to suction filtration using a filter paper, and moisture was removed. To the resultant cake, 2 L of water was added to be redispersed by agitation, and the resultant product was filtrated again.

Accordingly, it is found that the surface charge density of each sample increases as the molar percent of the fluorine atom increases. This finding shows that saponite, in which fluorine is subjected to isomorphous substitution, has a strong negative charge and a large surface charge density."
