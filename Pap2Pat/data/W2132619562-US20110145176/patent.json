                        "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, second only to skin cancer. A woman in the U.S. has a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during her lifetime, and the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be reported in the U.S. in 2007. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, with more than 40,000 deaths annually. Improved detection methods, mass screening, and advances in treatment over the last decade have significantly improved the outlook for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Today, approximately 80% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in the early stages of the disease when survival rates are at their highest. As a result, about 85% percent of breast cancer patients are alive at least five years after diagnosis. Despite these advances, approximately 20% of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer have a poor ten-year outcome and will suffer disease recurrence, metastasis or death within this time period.",
                        "Significant research has focused on identifying methods and factors for assessing breast cancer prognosis and predicting therapeutic response (See generally, Ross and Hortobagyi, eds. (2005) Molecular Oncology of Breast Cancer (Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, Mass.) and the references cited therein). Prognostic indicators include conventional factors, such as tumor size, nodal status and histological grade, as well as molecular markers that provide some information regarding prognosis and likely response to particular treatments. For example, determination of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) steroid hormone receptor status has become a routine procedure in assessment of breast cancer patients. See, for example, Fitzgibbons et al., Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 124:966-78, 2000. Tumors that are hormone receptor positive are more likely to respond to hormone therapy and also typically grow less aggressively, thereby resulting in a better prognosis for patients with ER+/PgR+ tumors. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor protein, has been correlated with poor breast cancer prognosis (see, e.g., Ross et al., The Oncologist 8:307-25, 2003), and HER-2 expression levels in breast tumors are used to predict response to the anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody therapeutic trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.)."

                                "Despite recent advances, the challenge of cancer treatment remains to target specific treatment regimens to distinct tumor types with different pathogenesis, and ultimately personalize tumor treatment in order to maximize outcome. In particular, once a patient is diagnosed with cancer, such as breast cancer, there is a need for methods that allow the physician to predict the expected course of disease, including the likelihood of cancer recurrence, long-term survival of the patient and the like, and select the most appropriate treatment options accordingly.",
                                "For the purposes of the present invention, \u201cbreast cancer\u201d includes, for example, those conditions classified by biopsy or histology as malignant pathology. The clinical delineation of breast cancer diagnoses is well-known in the medical arts. One of skill in the art will appreciate that breast cancer refers to any malignancy of the breast tissue, including, for example, carcinomas and sarcomas. Particular embodiments of breast cancer include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or mucinous carcinoma. Breast cancer also refers to infiltrating ductal (IDC) or infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC). In most embodiments of the invention, the subject of interest is a human patient suspected of or actually diagnosed with breast cancer.",
                                "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with respect to molecular alterations and cellular composition. This diversity creates a challenge for researchers trying to develop classifications that are clinically meaningful. Gene expression profiling by microarray has provided insight into the complexity of breast tumors and can be used to provide prognostic information beyond standard pathologic parameters (1-7).",
                                "Expression profiling of breast cancer identifies biologically and clinically distinct molecular subtypes which may require different treatment approaches [van't Veer 2005][Loi 2007][Cheang 2008a]. The major intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer referred to as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like have distinct clinical features, relapse risk and response to treatment [Sorlie 2003]. The \u201cintrinsic\u201d subtypes known as Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB), HER2-enriched, Basal-like, and Normal-like were discovered using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of microarray data (1, 8). Intrinsic genes, as described in Perou et al. (2000) Nature 406:747-752, are statistically selected to have low variation in expression between biological sample replicates from the same individual and high variation in expression across samples from different individuals. Thus, intrinsic genes are the classifier genes for breast cancer classification. Although clinical information was not used to derive the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes, this classification has proved to have prognostic significance (1, 6, 9, 10).",
                                "Breast tumors of the \u201cLuminal\u201d subtype are ER positive and have a similar keratin expression profile as the epithelial cells lining the lumen of the breast ducts (Taylor-Papadimitriou et al. (1989) J Cell Sci 94:403-413; Perou et al (2000) New Technologies for Life Sciences: A Trends Guide 67-76, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Conversely, ER-negative tumors can be broken into two main subtypes, namely those that overexpress (and are DNA amplified for) HER-2 and GRB7 (HER-2-enriched) and \u201cBasal-like\u201d tumors that have an expression profile similar to basal epithelium and express Keratin 5, 6B, and 17. Both these tumor subtypes are aggressive and typically more deadly than Luminal tumors; however, there are subtypes of Luminal tumors with different outcomes. The Luminal tumors with poor outcomes consistently share the histopathological feature of being higher grade and the molecular feature of highly expressing proliferation genes.",
                                "The translation of the intrinsic subtypes into a clinical assay has been challenging because unsupervised clustering is better suited to organizing large numbers of samples and genes than classifying individual samples using small gene sets.",
                                "Thus, provided herein are improved methods and compositions for classifying breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. The methods utilize a supervised algorithm to classify subject samples according to breast cancer intrinsic subtype. This algorithm, referred to herein as the PAM50 classification model, is based on the gene expression profile of a defined subset of intrinsic genes that has been identified herein as superior for classifying breast cancer intrinsic subtypes, and for predicting risk of relapse and/or response to therapy in a subject diagnosed with breast cancer. The subset of genes, along with primers specific for their detection, is provided in Table 1.",
                                "In some embodiments, at least about 40 of the genes listed in Table 1 are used in the PAM50 classification model. In other embodiments, at least 41, at least 43, at least 44, at least 45, at least 46, at least 47, at least 48, at least 49, or all 50 of the intrinsic genes listed in Table 1 are used in the model. The methods disclosed herein are not intended for use with one or only a few of the genes listed in Table 1. In fact, it is the combination of substantially all of the intrinsic genes that allows for the most accurate classification of intrinsic subtype and prognostication of outcome or therapeutic response to treatment. Thus, in various embodiments, the methods disclosed herein encompass obtaining the genetic profile of substantially all the genes listed in Table 1. \u201cSubstantially all\u201d may encompass at least 47, at least 48, at least 49, or all 50 of the genes listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise specified, \u201csubstantially all\u201d refers to at least 49 of the genes listed in Table 1. It will also be understood by one of skill in the art that one subset of the genes listed in Table 1 can be used to train an algorithm to predict breast cancer subtype or outcome, and another subset of the genes used to characterize an individual subject. Preferably, all 50 genes are used to train the algorithm, and at least 49 of the genes are used to characterize a subject.",
                                "\u201cGene expression\u201d as used herein refers to the relative levels of expression and/or pattern of expression of a gene. The expression of a gene may be measured at the level of DNA, cDNA, RNA, mRNA, or combinations thereof \u201cGene expression profile\u201d refers to the levels of expression of multiple different genes measured for the same sample. An expression profile can be derived from a biological sample collected from a subject at one or more time points prior to, during, or following diagnosis, treatment, or therapy for breast cancer (or any combination thereof), can be derived from a biological sample collected from a subject at one or more time points during which there is no treatment or therapy for breast cancer (e.g., to monitor progression of disease or to assess development of disease in a subject at risk for breast cancer), or can be collected from a healthy subject. Gene expression profiles may be measured in a sample, such as samples comprising a variety of cell types, different tissues, different organs, or fluids (e.g., blood, urine, spinal fluid, sweat, saliva or serum) by various methods including but not limited to microarray technologies and quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR techniques."

Examples of such biological samples include, but are not limited to, biopsies and smears. Bodily fluids useful in the present invention include blood, lymph, urine, saliva, nipple aspirates, gynecological fluids, or any other bodily secretion or derivative thereof. Blood can include whole blood, plasma, serum, or any derivative of blood. In some embodiments, the biological sample includes breast cells, particularly breast tissue from a biopsy, such as a breast tumor tissue sample. Biological samples may be obtained from a subject by a variety of techniques including, for example, by scraping or swabbing an area, by using a needle to aspirate cells or bodily fluids, or by removing a tissue sample (i.e., biopsy). Methods for collecting various biological samples are well known in the art. In some embodiments, a breast tissue sample is obtained by, for example, fine needle aspiration biopsy, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Fixative and staining solutions may be applied to the cells or tissues for preserving the specimen and for facilitating examination. Biological samples, particularly breast tissue samples, may be transferred to a glass slide for viewing under magnification. In one embodiment, the biological sample is a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tissue sample, particularly a primary breast tumor sample. In various embodiments, the tissue sample is obtained from a pathologist-guided tissue core sample as described in Example 4."

                                "In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods for classifying, prognosticating, or monitoring breast cancer in subjects. In this embodiment, data obtained from analysis of intrinsic gene expression is evaluated using one or more pattern recognition algorithms. Such analysis methods may be used to form a predictive model, which can be used to classify test data. For example, one convenient and particularly effective method of classification employs multivariate statistical analysis modeling, first to form a model (a \u201cpredictive mathematical model\u201d) using data (\u201cmodeling data\u201d) from samples of known subtype (e.g., from subjects known to have a particular breast cancer intrinsic subtype. LumA, LumB, Basal-like, HER2-enriched, or normal-like), and second to classify an unknown sample (e.g., \u201ctest sample\u201d) according to subtype.",
                                "Pattern recognition methods have been used widely to characterize many different types of problems ranging, for example, over linguistics, fingerprinting, chemistry and psychology. In the context of the methods described herein, pattern recognition is the use of multivariate statistics, both parametric and non-parametric, to analyze data, and hence to classify samples and to predict the value of some dependent variable based on a range of observed measurements. There are two main approaches. One set of methods is termed \u201cunsupervised\u201d and these simply reduce data complexity in a rational way and also produce display plots which can be interpreted by the human eye. However, this type of approach may not be suitable for developing a clinical assay that can be used to classify samples derived from subjects independent of the initial sample population used to train the prediction algorithm.",
                                "The other approach is termed \u201csupervised\u201d whereby a training set of samples with known class or outcome is used to produce a mathematical model which is then evaluated with independent validation data sets. Here, a \u201ctraining set\u201d of intrinsic gene expression data is used to construct a statistical model that predicts correctly the \u201csubtype\u201d of each sample. This training set is then tested with independent data (referred to as a test or validation set) to determine the robustness of the computer-based model. These models are sometimes termed \u201cexpert systems,\u201d but may be based on a range of different mathematical procedures. Supervised methods can use a data set with reduced dimensionality (for example, the first few principal components), but typically use unreduced data, with all dimensionality. In all cases the methods allow the quantitative description of the multivariate boundaries that characterize and separate each subtype in terms of its intrinsic gene expression profile. It is also possible to obtain confidence limits on any predictions, for example, a level of probability to be placed on the goodness of fit (see, for example, Kowalski et al., 1986). The robustness of the predictive models can also be checked using cross-validation, by leaving out selected samples from the analysis.",
                                "The PAM50 classification model described herein is based on the gene expression profile for a plurality of subject samples using the intrinsic genes listed in Table 1. The plurality of samples includes a sufficient number of samples derived from subjects belonging to each subtype class. By \u201csufficient samples\u201d or \u201crepresentative number\u201d in this context is intended a quantity of samples derived from each subtype that is sufficient for building a classification model that can reliably distinguish each subtype from all others in the group. A supervised prediction algorithm is developed based on the profiles of objectively-selected prototype samples for \u201ctraining\u201d the algorithm. The samples are selected and subtyped using an expanded intrinsic gene set according to the methods disclosed in International Patent Publication WO 2007/061876, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, the samples can be subtyped according to any known assay for classifying breast cancer subtypes. After stratifying the training samples according to subtype, a centroid-based prediction algorithm is used to construct centroids based on the expression profile of the intrinsic gene set described in Table 1.",
                                "In one embodiment, the prediction algorithm is the nearest centroid methodology related to that described in Narashiman and Chu (2002) PNAS 99:6567-6572, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the present invention, the method computes a standardized centroid for each subtype. This centroid is the average gene expression for each gene in each subtype (or \u201cclass\u201d) divided by the within-class standard deviation for that gene. Nearest centroid classification takes the gene expression profile of a new sample, and compares it to each of these class centroids. Subtype prediction is done by calculating the Spearman's rank correlation of each test case to the five centroids, and assigning a sample to a subtype based on the nearest centroid."

The methods generally detect expression products (e.g., mRNA) of the intrinsic genes listed in Table 1. In preferred embodiments, PCR-based methods, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Weis et al., TIG 8:263-64, 1992), and array-based methods such as microarray (Schena et al., Science 270:467-70, 1995) are used.

Examples of molecules that can be utilized as probes include, but are not limited to, RNA, DNA, proteins, antibodies, and organic molecules.",
                                "Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA. The starting material is typically total RNA isolated from a biological sample, such as a tumor or tumor cell line, and corresponding normal tissue or cell line, respectively. If the source of RNA is a primary tumor, RNA (e.g., mRNA) can be extracted, for example, from frozen or archived paraffin-embedded and fixed (e.g., formalin-fixed) tissue samples (e.g., pathologist-guided tissue core samples).",

Methods for RNA extraction from paraffin embedded tissues are disclosed, for example, in Rupp and Locker (Lab Invest. 56:A67, 1987) and De Andres et al. (Biotechniques 18:42-44, 1995). In particular, RNA isolation can be performed using a purification kit, a buffer set and protease from commercial manufacturers, such as Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For example, total RNA from cells in culture can be isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini-columns. Other commercially available RNA isolation kits include MASTERPURE\u2122 Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Madison, Wis.) and Paraffin Block RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Total RNA from tissue samples can be isolated, for example, using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, Tex.). RNA prepared from a tumor can be isolated, for example, by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Additionally, large numbers of tissue samples can readily be processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, the single-step RNA isolation process of Chomczynski (U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,155).",

One method for the detection of RNA levels involves contacting the isolated RNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length cDNA, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 60, 100, 250, or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to an intrinsic gene of the present invention, or any derivative DNA or RNA. Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the intrinsic gene in question is being expressed.",

In an alternative embodiment, the probes are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probes, for example, in an Agilent gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of expression of the intrinsic genes of the present invention.",
                                "An alternative method for determining the level of intrinsic gene expression product in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification, for example, by RT-PCR (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:189-93, 1991), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

No. 5,854,033), or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers.",
                                "In particular aspects of the invention, intrinsic gene expression is assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Numerous different PCR or QPCR protocols are known in the art and exemplified herein below and can be directly applied or adapted for use using the presently-described compositions for the detection and/or quantification of the intrinsic genes listed in Table 1. Generally, in PCR, a target polynucleotide sequence is amplified by reaction with at least one oligonucleotide primer or pair of oligonucleotide primers. The primer(s) hybridize to a complementary region of the target nucleic acid and a DNA polymerase extends the primer(s) to amplify the target sequence. Under conditions sufficient to provide polymerase-based nucleic acid amplification products, a nucleic acid fragment of one size dominates the reaction products (the target polynucleotide sequence which is the amplification product). The amplification cycle is repeated to increase the concentration of the single target polynucleotide sequence. The reaction can be performed in any thermocycler commonly used for PCR. However, preferred are cyclers with real-time fluorescence measurement capabilities, for example, SMARTCYCLER\u00ae (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, Calif.), ABI PRISM 7700\u00ae (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), ROTOR-GENE\u2122 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia), LIGHTCYCLER\u00ae (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, Ind.), ICYCLER\u00ae (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) and MX4000\u00ae (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.).",
                                "Quantitative PCR (QPCR) (also referred as real-time PCR) is preferred under some circumstances because it provides not only a quantitative measurement, but also reduced time and contamination. In some instances, the availability of full gene expression profiling techniques is limited due to requirements for fresh frozen tissue and specialized laboratory equipment, making the routine use of such technologies difficult in a clinical setting. However, QPCR gene measurement can be applied to standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor blocks, such as those used in archival tissue banks and routine surgical pathology specimens (Cronin et al. (2007) Clin Chem 53:1084-91)[Mullins 2007] [Paik 2004]. As used herein, \u201cquantitative PCR (or \u201creal time QPCR\u201d) refers to the direct monitoring of the progress of PCR amplification as it is occurring without the need for repeated sampling of the reaction products. In quantitative PCR, the reaction products may be monitored via a signaling mechanism (e.g., fluorescence) as they are generated and are tracked after the signal rises above a background level but before the reaction reaches a plateau. The number of cycles required to achieve a detectable or \u201cthreshold\u201d level of fluorescence varies directly with the concentration of amplifiable targets at the beginning of the PCR process, enabling a measure of signal intensity to provide a measure of the amount of target nucleic acid in a sample in real time.",
                                "In another embodiment of the invention, microarrays are used for expression profiling. Microarrays are particularly well suited for this purpose because of the reproducibility between different experiments. DNA microarrays provide one method for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of large numbers of genes. Each array consists of a reproducible pattern of capture probes attached to a solid support. Labeled RNA or DNA is hybridized to complementary probes on the array and then detected by laser scanning. Hybridization intensities for each probe on the array are determined and converted to a quantitative value representing relative gene expression levels. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,040,138, 5,800,992 and 6,020,135, 6,033,860, and 6,344,316. High-density oligonucleotide arrays are particularly useful for determining the gene expression profile for a large number of RNAs in a sample.",

Although a planar array surface is generally used, the array can be fabricated on a surface of virtually any shape or even a multiplicity of surfaces. Arrays can be nucleic acids (or peptides) on beads, gels, polymeric surfaces, fibers (such as fiber optics), glass, or any other appropriate substrate. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,358, 5,789,162, 5,708,153, 6,040,193 and 5,800,992. Arrays can be packaged in such a manner as to allow for diagnostics or other manipulation of an all-inclusive device. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,856,174 and 5,922,591.",
                                "In a specific embodiment of the microarray technique, PCR amplified inserts of cDNA clones are applied to a substrate in a dense array. The microarrayed genes, immobilized on the microchip, are suitable for hybridization under stringent conditions. Fluorescently labeled cDNA probes can be generated through incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides by reverse transcription of RNA extracted from tissues of interest. Labeled cDNA probes applied to the chip hybridize with specificity to each spot of DNA on the array. After stringent washing to remove non-specifically bound probes, the chip is scanned by confocal laser microscopy or by another detection method, such as a CCD camera. Quantitation of hybridization of each arrayed element allows for assessment of corresponding mRNA abundance.",
                                "With dual color fluorescence, separately labeled cDNA probes generated from two sources of RNA are hybridized pairwise to the array. The relative abundance of the transcripts from the two sources corresponding to each specified gene is thus determined simultaneously. The miniaturized scale of the hybridization affords a convenient and rapid evaluation of the expression pattern for large numbers of genes. Such methods have been shown to have the sensitivity required to detect rare transcripts, which are expressed at a few copies per cell, and to reproducibly detect at least approximately two-fold differences in the expression levels (Schena et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:106-49, 1996). Microarray analysis can be performed by commercially available equipment, following manufacturer's protocols, such as by using the Affymetrix GenChip technology, or Agilent ink jet microarray technology. The development of microarray methods for large-scale analysis of gene expression makes it possible to search systematically for molecular markers of cancer classification and outcome prediction in a variety of tumor types."

By using prior knowledge and experience about the type of data studied, the quality of the data prior to multivariate modeling can be enhanced by scaling and/or weighting. Adequate scaling and/or weighting can reveal important and interesting variation hidden within the data, and therefore make subsequent multivariate modeling more efficient. Scaling and weighting may be used to place the data in the correct metric, based on knowledge and experience of the studied system, and therefore reveal patterns already inherently present in the data.",

However, if necessary, such missing data may replaced or \u201cfilled\u201d with, for example, the mean value of a column (\u201cmean fill\u201d); a random value (\u201crandom fill\u201d); or a value based on a principal component analysis (\u201cprincipal component fill\u201d).",

Examples of such translation include normalization and mean centering. \u201cNormalization\u201d may be used to remove sample-to-sample variation. For microarray data, the process of normalization aims to remove systematic errors by balancing the fluorescence intensities of the two labeling dyes. The dye bias can come from various sources including differences in dye labeling efficiencies, heat and light sensitivities, as well as scanner settings for scanning two channels. Some commonly used methods for calculating normalization factor include: (i) global normalization that uses all genes on the array; (ii) housekeeping genes normalization that uses constantly expressed housekeeping/invariant genes; and (iii) internal controls normalization that uses known amount of exogenous control genes added during hybridization (Quackenbush (2002) Nat. Genet. 32 (Suppl.), 496-501). In one embodiment, the intrinsic genes disclosed herein can be normalized to control housekeeping genes. For example, the housekeeping genes described in U.S. Patent Publication 2008/0032293, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, can be used for normalization. Exemplary housekeeping genes include MRPL19, PSMC4, SF3A1, PUM1, ACTB, GAPD, GUSB, RPLP0, and TFRC. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the methods disclosed herein are not bound by normalization to any particular housekeeping genes, and that any suitable housekeeping gene(s) known in the art can be used.",
                                "Many normalization approaches are possible, and they can often be applied at any of several points in the analysis. In one embodiment, microarray data is normalized using the LOWESS method, which is a global locally weighted scatterplot smoothing normalization function. In another embodiment, qPCR data is normalized to the geometric mean of set of multiple housekeeping genes.",

In this way, the mean of a descriptor coincides with the origin, and all descriptors are \u201ccentered\u201d at zero. In \u201cunit variance scaling,\u201d data can be scaled to equal variance. Usually, the value of each descriptor is scaled by 1/StDev, where StDev is the standard deviation for that descriptor for all samples. \u201cPareto scaling\u201d is, in some sense, intermediate between mean centering and unit variance scaling. In pareto scaling, the value of each descriptor is scaled by 1/sqrt(StDev), where StDev is the standard deviation for that descriptor for all samples. In this way, each descriptor has a variance numerically equal to its initial standard deviation. The pareto scaling may be performed, for example, on raw data or mean centered data.",
                                "\u201cLogarithmic scaling\u201d may be used to assist interpretation when data have a positive skew and/or when data spans a large range, e.g., several orders of magnitude. Usually, for each descriptor, the value is replaced by the logarithm of that value. In \u201cequal range scaling,\u201d each descriptor is divided by the range of that descriptor for all samples. In this way, all descriptors have the same range, that is, 1. However, this method is sensitive to presence of outlier points. In \u201cautoscaling,\u201d each data vector is mean centered and unit variance scaled. This technique is a very useful because each descriptor is then weighted equally, and large and small values are treated with equal emphasis. This can be important for genes expressed at very low, but still detectable, levels.",

DWD is a multivariate analysis tool that is able to identify systematic biases present in separate data sets and then make a global adjustment to compensate for these biases; in essence, each separate data set is a multi-dimensional cloud of data points, and DWD takes two points clouds and shifts one such that it more optimally overlaps the other.",

This classification is based on expression profiling using the list of intrinsic genes listed in Table 1. As discussed in Example 1, tumor subtype according to the PAM50 model was more indicative of response to chemotherapy than standard clinical marker classification. Tumors classified as HER2+ using clinical markers but not HER2-enriched using the PAM50 model had a lower pathological complete response (pCR) to a regimen of paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) than tumors classified as HER2+ clinically and belonging to the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Similarly, Basal-like tumors that were not clinically scored as triple-negative (ER-, PgR- and HER2-) had a higher pCR compared to triple-negative tumors that were not Basal-like by PAM50. Thus, the PAM50 model can be used to more accurately predict response to chemotherapy than standard clinical markers.",

The intrinsic subtypes and ROR also have value in the prediction of pathological complete response in women treated with, for example, neoadjuvant taxane and anthracycline chemotherapy [Rouzier 2005]. Thus, in various embodiments of the present invention, a risk of relapse (ROR) model is used to predict outcome. Using these risk models, subjects can be stratified into low, medium, and high risk of relapse groups. Calculation of ROR can provide prognostic information to guide treatment decisions and/or monitor response to therapy.",

Analysis of a variety of clinical factors and clinical trials has led to the development of recommendations and treatment guidelines for early-stage breast cancer by the International Consensus Panel of the St. Gallen Conference (2005). See, Goldhirsch et al., Annals Oncol. 16:1569-83, 2005. The guidelines recommend that patients be offered chemotherapy for endocrine non-responsive disease; endocrine therapy as the primary therapy for endocrine responsive disease, adding chemotherapy for some intermediate- and all high-risk groups in this category; and both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for all patients in the uncertain endocrine response category except those in the low-risk group.",

                                "In some embodiments, the relevant time for assessing prognosis or disease-free survival time begins with the surgical removal of the tumor or suppression, mitigation, or inhibition of tumor growth. In another embodiment, the PAM50-based risk score is calculated based on a sample obtained after initiation of neoadjuvant therapy such as endocrine therapy. The sample may be taken at any time following initiation of therapy, but is preferably obtained after about one month so that neoadjuvant therapy can be switched to chemotherapy in unresponsive patients. It has been shown that a subset of tumors indicated for endocrine treatment before surgery is non-responsive to this therapy. The model provided herein can be used to identify aggressive tumors that are likely to be refractory to endocrine therapy, even when tumors are positive for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. In this embodiment, a proliferation-weighted PAM50 risk score is obtained according the following equation: RSp=(\u22120.0129*Basal)+(0.106*Her2)+(\u22120.112*LumA)+(0.039*LumB)+(\u22120.069*Normal)+(0.272*Prolif), where the proliferation score (\u201cprolif\u201d) is assigned as the mean measurement of the following genes (after normalization): CCNB1, UBE2C, BIRCS, KNTC2, CDC20, PTTG1, RRM2, MKI67, TYMS, CEP55, and CDCA1. All other variables are the same as the RS equations described infra. As discussed in Example 2, assessment of risk score after initiation of therapy is more predictive of outcome to treatment, at least in a population of ER+ patients undergoing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy."

The purpose of the methods described here was to standardize and validate a classification for the intrinsic subtypes for clinical and research purposes. \u201cSigClust\u201d objectively identified five intrinsic breast subtypes from clustered microarray data. These prototypes were then used to derive a minimal 50-gene set (PAM50). Finally, the best classification method was selected and used with the PAM50 to predict subtypes on multiple test sets from microarray and qRT-PCR data. Of the 5 microarray studies with outcome data (Table 4), the UNC cohort had significantly worse outcomes than the others. Subtype predictions onto a combined microarray test set showed prognostic significance across all patients, in patients given endocrine treatment alone, and in node negative patients receiving no systemic adjuvant therapy (FIG. 1).",

The LumA and HER2-enriched subtypes and the clinical variables were also significant in multivariate analyses, suggesting that the most comprehensive model should include subtype and clinical information. Testing this hypothesis revealed that the combined model accounts for significantly more variation in survival than either the subtype or clinical variables alone (p<0.0001 for both tests).",

Conversely when ER-negative tumors were considered, approximately 13% were Luminal (A and B), 31% were HER2-enriched and 48% were Basal-like. Tumors identified as the Normal-like subtype were divided almost equally between ER-positive (11%) and ER-negative (8%) tumors. Therefore, while subtype representation markedly changed in distribution depending on ER-status, all subtypes were represented in both ER-positive and ER-negative categories. Outcome plots for the subtypes in ER-positive cases alone were significant for relapse free survival and followed the same trends as seen when considering all invasive breast disease.",

For HER2 status, 64% of tumors that were HER2-positive by clinical assay (FISH+ and/or IHC 3+, referred to as HER2+clin) were classified into the HER2-enriched expression subtype, with the rest of the HER2+clin mostly associated with the Luminal subtypes.

The PAM50 classification of Basal-like appears superior to the clinical triple-negative with respect to pCR rate in that Basal-like tumors that were not scored as triple-negative had a 50% pCR compared to triple-negative tumors that were not Basal-like by PAM50 (22% pCR, Table 7).",

An untreated cohort was selected from the NKI microarray dataset to train the risk of relapse (ROR) model and select cut-offs. Two Cox models (one based upon subtype alone and another based upon subtype, tumor size, and node status) were validated using the combined microarray test set. Excluding clinical variables, the subtype only model performed well at stratifying patients into low, medium, and high risk of relapse groups (c-index=0.65 [0.61-0.69]); however, the full model (subtype, tumor size, node status) performed better (c-index=0.70 [0.66-0.74]), and, in practice, stage is a parameter that needs to be accounted for (FIG. 2). FIG. 3 shows the probability of relapse-free survival at 5 years plotted as a continuous linear scale using the full model.",

The subtype classifications followed the same survival trends as seen in the microarray data and the ROR score was significant for long-term relapse predictions. This old age sample set was also scored for standard clinical markers (ER and HER2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and compared to the gene expression-based test. Analysis of ESR1 and ERBB2 by gene expression showed high sensitivity and specificity as compared to the IHC assay.",

                                "The PAM50 classifier was developed using a statistically derived gene and sample set and was validated across multiple cohorts and platforms with the intent of delivering a clinical diagnostic test for the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer. The large and diverse test sets allowed evaluation of the performance of the assay at a population level and in relation to standard molecular markers. An important finding from these analyses is that all of the intrinsic subtypes are present within both clinically defined ER-positive and ER-negative tumor subsets, with the subtype designations in the ER-positive patients showing prognostic significance. Thus, the molecular subtypes are not simply another method of classification based upon ER status.",
                                "There were also other important findings concerning individual subtypes. For example, some of the tumors classified into the HER2-enriched expression subtype were not HER2+clin, suggesting the presence of an ER-negative non-Basal subtype that is not driven by HER2 gene amplification. It was also found that about 10% of breast cancers were classified as Normal-like and can be either ER-positive or ER-negative and have an intermediate prognosis. Since these tumors were predicted by training on normal breast tissue, the Normal-like class may be an artifact of having a high percentage of normal \u201ccontamination\u201d in the tumor specimen. Other possibilities are that these are slow growing Basal-like tumors that lack high expression of the proliferation genes, or are a potential new subtype that has been referred to as claudin-low tumors (25). Detailed histological, immunohistochemical, and additional gene expression analyses of these cases are needed to resolve these issues.",
                                "Discrepancies between subtype and standard molecular markers have important therapeutic implications. For instance, a patient with a Basal-like subtype tumor that was scored ER or PgR-positive would likely be treated by endocrine therapy and would not be eligible for protocols that aim to develop Basal-like specific therapies (e.g. platinum containing regimens). These analyses of the Hess et al. dataset (19) showed that no patient with the LumA subtype had a pCR when administered an aggressive neoadjuvant regimen whereas the pCR rate of the Basal-like tumors was 59%. Furthermore, there has been debate about whether the triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-) phenotype is the same as the Basal-like expression subtype26. A recent tissue microarray study of 3744 tumors confirmed the poor prognosis of triple-negative cases, but also revealed that tumors lacking all markers did not behave the same as those that were positive for one or two Basal-like markers (i.e. CK5/6 or HER1) (27). In agreement with the idea that the Basal-like diagnosis should be made independent of clinical ER and PgR status, a higher therapeutic response to T/FAC was found in those subjects identified as Basal-like but non-triple negative (50%) versus those identified as triple-negative but not Basal-like (22%). This suggests that the Basal-like subtype designation may ultimately prove superior to the triple-negative definition in identifying tumors with a high degree of chemotherapy sensitivity.",
                                "Providing an absolute subtype classification is somewhat artificial as tumors do not exist as discrete biological entities. Classification of tumors into low-medium-high risk groups based upon distance to each subtype centroid (i.e. the ROR model) was an attempt to deal with this issue and yielded significant survival segregation. This was true when combining all test cases, or after stratification into cohorts given endocrine therapy only, or no systemic adjuvant treatment. One of the major benefits of the ROR predictor is the identification of LumA patients that are at a very low risk of relapse, and for whom the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is unlikely. In this context the ROR predictor based on subtypes provides similar information as the OncotypeDx Recurrence Score for ER-positive, node negative patients (4, 5). However the PAM50 based assay provides a risk of relapse score for all patients, including those with ER-negative disease.",
                                "In summary, this subtype predictor and ROR classifier effectively identifies molecular features in breast tumors that are important for prognosis and treatment. The qRT-PCR assay can be performed using archived breast tissues, which will be useful for retrospective studies and prospective clinical trials."

A prognostic gene expression model trained on tumor samples taken before treatment (PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score\u2014described elsewhere herein) was applied to samples taken after the initiation of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. This approach is unique because previous studies on the interaction of gene expression profiles and prognosis have only examined pretreatment samples and have never applied these models to post treatment samples. The prognostic and predictive properties of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype and proliferation weighted prognostic model in baseline samples is compared to the same models applied to samples taken one month after initiating neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Application of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype and proliferation-weighted risk of relapse model to the one month on treatment samples accurately identifies aggressive tumors that fail to respond to neo adjuvant or adjuvant endocrine treatment. Patients with these tumors should be immediately triaged to alternative neoadjuvant treatments, such as chemotherapy, because these poor tumors behave as endocrine therapy refractory aggressive disease. A high degree of correlation was established between the Ki67 proliferation marker and the proliferation weighted PAM50 risk score supporting the claim that the PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score has prognostic properties. However these prognostic properties are markedly enhanced when the analysis is applied to samples harvested from tumors that have been exposed to an endocrine agent. In practice this can be easily achieved by prescribing an endocrine agent for a few weeks before definitive surgery or by re-sampling a tumor early in the course of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in order to identify unresponsive tumors."

Eligibility for the trial required postmenopausal women with ER and/or PgR positive Stage 2 and 3 breast cancers. Patients received 4 months of therapy and then they underwent surgery. Frozen tumor samples were obtained at baseline, one month and at surgery. The samples were analyzed by frozen-section and RNA was extracted using standard methodologies from tumor rich specimens and subjected to gene expression analysis using Agilent 1\u00d744K arrays. The data was normalized to the data set used to train the PAM50 classifier (methods described above) and two readouts were produced: An intrinsic classification (LumA, LumB, HER2-enriched, Basal-like and Normal-like) and a proliferation weighted PAM50 risk score. The aim of this study was to correlate the outcomes of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with the intrinsic classification and the proliferation weighted risk score derived from both the baseline sample and the on treatment sample taken at one month."

                                "The PAM50 intrinsic subtype and proliferation weighted risk score showed marked changes at one month post therapy (Table 8). Most of the transitions occurred in the LumB group with the majority shifting to LumA, but 16% remained in the LumB category despite treatment. In contrast, most LumA tumors stayed LumA post therapy. These transitions were due to the suppression of the proliferation cluster in the LumB group since the PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score showed similar shifts, with the majority of tumors typed high risk (68%) becoming intermediate or low risk in the on treatment samples. Tight correlation with Ki67 immunohistochemisty further underscores this conclusion. The correlation between baseline Ki67 values and PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score was high (P=2.8xE-8). Similarly the one month Ki67 values and the one month PAM50 proliferation score were also tightly correlated (P=3.8E-10). However, while the baseline PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score subtype exhibited only a very weak correlation with the end of study Ki67 values (P=0.04), there was a tight correlation between the one month PAM50 proliferation weighted risk score and the end of study Ki67 values\u2014most of which were obtained at surgery 4 to 6 months later (P=6.8E-11). This last observation strongly supports the claim that an early on treatment PAM50 based test can be used to predict whether the final surgical samples will have favorable biomarker features, such as a low proliferation rate.",
                                "To determine the clinical correlations associated with these endocrine-therapy induced changes in intrinsic breast cancer subtype and risk score, four endpoints were examined: clinical response (RECIST criteria), pathological T size (T1 versus higher\u2014as evidence for pathological down staging with treatment), dichotomized Ki67 values (with tumors exhibiting a Ki67 natural log value of 1 or less considered to be exhibiting a favorable profile) and relapse events. The baseline subtype or risk score showed no convincing ability to predict any of these endpoints, which, in terms of the relapse, is likely a function of the small sample size in this trial (Table 9). In contrast, and despite the small sample size, the PAM50 intrinsic subtype at one month (Table 10) did show statistically significant relationships with clinical response (P=0.01), favorable end of treatment Ki67 value (P=0.0003) and relapse (0.009). These strong relationships were driven by the extremely poor outcome associated with tumors that were either designated \u201cnon-luminal\u201d or Luminal B in the on treatment specimens. The PAM50 proliferation-weighted risk score had similar properties. Baseline PAM50 proliferation-weighted risks score did not predict the neoadjuvant or long term outcomes very effectively (Table 11). However tumors that were designated high risk at one month showed significant correlations with poor outcomes in all four endpoints examined, i.e. poor clinical response (P=0.02), low pathological down-staging (p=0.02), unfavorable end of treatment Ki67 value (P=0.0001) and relapse (p=0.001) (Table 12).",

Table 13 shows the multivariable analyses of these models in an independent cohort of untreated patients (see Example 1). In model A, subtypes, tumor size (T1 or greater) and histologic grade were found to be significant factors for ROR. The great majority of basal-like tumors (95.9%) were found to be medium or high grade, and therefore, in model B, which is an analysis without grade, basal-like becomes significant. Model C shows the significance of the subtypes in the node-negative population. All models that included subtype and clinical variables were significantly better than either clinical alone (P<0.0001) or subtype alone (P<0.0001). A relapse classifier was trained to predict outcomes within the context of the intrinsic subtypes and clinical variables. A node-negative, no systemic treatment cohort (n=141) was selected from the van de Vijver et al. (2002) microarray data set to train the ROR model and to select cut-offs. There was a clear improvement in preduction with subtype (ROR-S) relative to the model of available clinical variables only (see Parker et al. (2009) J Clin Oncol 27(8):1160-1167). A combination of clinical variables and subtype (ROR-C) is also a significant improvement over either individual predictor. However, information on grade did not significantly improve the C-index in the combined model, indicating that the prognostic value of grade had been superseded by information provided by the intrinsic subtype model. When using ROR-C for ROR in a prognostic test set of untreated node-negative patients, only the LumA group contained any low-risk patients, and the three-class distinction of low, medium, and high risk was prognostic. Also, ROR-C scores have a linear relationship with probability of relapse at 5 years."

The only significant variables in the context of this study were the intrinsic subtypes. A 94% sensitivity and 97% negative predictive value was found for identifying nonresponders to chemotherapy when using the ROR-S model to predict pCR. The relationship between high-risk scores and a higher probability of pCR is consistent with the conclusion that indolent ER-positive tumors (LumA) are less responsive to chemotherapy. However, unlike ROR for prognosis, a plateau seems to be reached for the ROR versus probability of pCR, confirming the presence of significant chemotherapy resistance among the highest risk tumors."

Tissue had been excised at various hospitals around the province, frozen and shipped to the central estrogen receptor (ER) laboratory at Vancouver Hospital; the portion of the received material that was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as a histological reference is used in this study. Clinical information linked to the specimens includes age, histology, grade, tumor size, number involved axillary nodes, lymphatic or vascular invasion, ER status by the DCC method, type of local and initial adjuvant systemic therapy, dates of diagnosis, first local, regional or distant recurrence, date and cause of death. Characteristics of this patient cohort have been previously described in detail in a population-based study validating the prognostic model ADJUVANT! [Olivotto 2005], and the same source blocks were used to assemble tissue microarrays that have been characterized for ER[Cheang 2006] and HER2[Chia 2008] expression. For this study, patients were selected who had ER positive tumors by immunohistochemistry, and received tamoxifen as their sole adjuvant systemic therapy. During the time period when these patients received their treatment, provincial guidelines recommended adjuvant tamoxifen for post-menopausal women, with ER-positive tumors who had some high risk features present such as lymphovascular invasion. Similar patients without high risk features were mainly treated without adjuvant systemic therapy. In most cases, chemotherapy was only offered to premenopausal women."

Template was of technically sufficient quality (based on internal housekeeper gene controls) for qRT-PCR in 806.

For the nine cases assigned as Normal-like, the histology was reviewed, using the tissue microarray cores taken from the same area of the source block. In eight of these nine cases, viable invasive cancer cells were absent or rare in an immediately adjacent core, consistent with the normal-like expression profile representing an inadequate tumor sampling. Normal-like cases were therefore excluded from further analysis.",

Intrinsic biological subtype remained significant in the multivariable model, as were nodal status and tumor size, but grade and clinical HER2 status, significant in univariate analysis in this cohort, did not contribute significant independent prognostic information for either relapse-free or disease-specific survival in the multivariate model incorporating the PAM50 result.",

                                "As shown in FIG. 6, the ROR-C algorithm is not only highly prognostic among node negative patients, but reveals even wider differences in disease-specific survival among node positive patients. The algorithm identifies 16% of clinically ER positive patients (treated with adjuvant tamoxifen but not chemotherapy) who, despite being node positive, are classed as low risk, and these women have a 10 year disease-specific survival rate of 89%.",
                                "As a continuous variable, ROR-C has a significant interaction with percentage of positive lymph nodes, and borderline significant interaction with nodal stage (Table 17). Nodal stage is a significant predictor among patients with moderate to high ROR-C values (>23.5), but among patients with low ROR-C scores, outcomes are good regardless of nodal status (FIG. 7 and FIG. 8).",
                                "As ROR-C includes tumor size information, to assess if the ROR algorithm gives independent additional prognostic information beyond standard clinical parameters (including tumor size) in this patient population, Cox models incorporating ROR-S were tested (Table 18). Regardless of whether the endpoint is relapse-free or disease-specific survival, or if ROR-S is included as a categorical or as a continuous variable, it remains significant, whereas grade and clinical HER2 status are not significant in multivariate analyses that include the qPCR-derived information.",
                                "The cases in this series have previously been assessed by immunohistochemistry for ER, PR, HER2, cytokeratin 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Ki67 [Cheang 2008] [Cheang 2009], allowing intrinsic subtyping to be assigned by a surrogate immunohistochemical definition. As all cases in this series are ER positive by immunohistochemistry, all were assigned as either Luminal A (if HER2 negative and Ki67 low) or Luminal B (if HER2 positive or Ki67 high). The availability of qPCR subtyping assignments allows a comparison with immunohistochemical assignment on the same material, against patient outcome in this homogeneously-treated cohort. A total of 606 cases had sufficiently complete immunohistochemical and qPCR data for assignment to a Luminal subtype by both methods. Among these, 255 were assigned as Luminal A and 193 as Luminal B by both methods, whereas 99 were assigned Luminal A by immunostain but Luminal B by qPCR, and 59 as Luminal B by immunostain but Luminal A by qPCR, for a concordance of 74%, kappa=0.48. Where the results were discordant, only the cases assigned as Luminal B by PCR had significantly poorer outcome than those concordantly assigned as Luminal A. In multivariable analysis among these cases, both immunohistochemical and PAM50 assignment are independently significant predictors for relapse-free survival, whereas grade and HER2 status fall out of the model (Table 19). For disease-specific survival, PAM50 is significant whereas immunohistochemistry is borderline. The magnitude of the identified hazard is higher with the qPCR assignment for both endpoints. In a step-wise Cox regression model incorporating both immunohistochemical and qPCR assignment, only qPCR stays significant.",

This cohort consists of 806 patients diagnosed with invasive, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, between the dates of 1986 and 1992. All patients had primary surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy with tamoxifen alone; none of these patients were treated with chemotherapy. The Adjuvant prognostic model was used to calculate the probability of breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) at 10 years using the standard clinicopathological features of patient age, tumor size, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, and number of positive lymph nodes. All patients were ER positive, and the risk of breast cancer death was adjusted for adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.",
                                "Of the 806 patients, 748 had sufficient clinicopathological data to obtain an Adjuvant estimate of BCSS. The remaining 58 patients had either missing tumor size or missing lymph node data. The mean Adjuvant predicted BCSS was 73.7%. This corresponds to the observed BCSS of 73.2%. The cohort was then divided into subgroups based on the Adjuvant predicted BCSS at 10 years (Table 20).",
                                "The observed BCSS at 10 years, for each of the Adjuvant risk groups was similar to the BCSS predicted by Adjuvant (Table 21). One notable exception is the lowest risk group, in subgroup with an Adjuvant! predicted BCSS of 90-100%, the observed BCSS at 10 years is 89%. Consequently, it appears that Adjuvant is overestimating survival is this low risk group. This is consistent with the validation study of Adjuvant! using the BCOU database (Olivotto et al. (2005)). In this validation study, it was found that Adjuvant underestimated breast cancer deaths by 4.9% in the subgroup with T1N0 disease. In the subgroup of patients with a predicted BCSS of 90-100%, 87 of 122 patients had T1N0 breast cancer.",
                                "ROR-S using qRT-PCR data from 50 genes was then used to separate each Adjuvant! group into low vs. medium/high risk (Table 22). Due to the relatively small size of each group, medium and high risk groups were combined to improve statistical power. Also, because the Adjuvant! risk subgroups are already defined using clinical factors, ROR-S (rather than ROR-C) was applied.",
                                "Kaplan-Meier analysis was then performed separately on each Adjuvant risk group, and differences in survival between the low vs. med/high risk ROR-S groups were tested using the log-rank test (Table 23). It was observed that ROR-S could isolate a low risk subgroup in each of the Adjuvant Risk Groups. Statistically significant differences in BCSS were found for low risk vs. medium/high risk patients, in all subgroups except for the 90-100% group.",
                                "In this low risk group, ROR-S is not quite statistically significant (p=0.058). However, this group does provide some convincing evidence that the ROR-S is adding additional prognostic information to Adjuvant!. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the same group but with Adjuvant! predicted BCSS 90-95% vs. 95-100% is shown in FIG. 9.",
                                "In the intermediate risk groups, ROR-S performs well in identifying low risk vs. higher risk patients. In both the 80-90% group (FIG. 10A) and 70-80% group (FIG. 10B), the ROR-S identifies subgroups with 10 year BCSS >90%. This is an important result as ROR-S identifies traditionally high-risk patients that do well without chemotherapy.",
                                "In the very high risk subgroup identified by Adjuvant! (Predicted BCSS <70%), ROR-S is still able to identify distinct prognostic groups (FIG. 10C)."

                                "Previous studies have established that intrinsic biological signatures characteristic of Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-Enriched and Basal-like subtypes are present and have prognostic significance in breast cancer cohorts from multiple different institutions, profiled with several gene expression microarray platforms [Calza 2006] [Kapp 2006][Hu 2006][Fan 2006]. In order to identify these subtypes on standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathology specimens, a quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR test [Mullins 2007] was developed that identifies these subtypes based on a panel of 50 genes.",
                                "The analysis reported here consists exclusively of qPCR-based testing, applied to a series of relatively old-age (15-20 years) paraffin blocks with long and detailed follow-up, allowing analysis not only of relapse-free survival, but also of breast cancer disease-specific survival. The present study consists of women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer who received hormonal therapy (tamoxifen) as their sole adjuvant treatment, a group of particular clinical importance and contemporary relevance. Estrogen receptor and HER2 status were centrally determined. 70% of these women were node positive at presentation, and in current practice would usually be recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The PAM50 subtype assignment as determined by PCR is highly prognostic in these women. Subtype remains significant in multivariate analysis, whereas grade and clinical HER2 status do not. Findings using the commonly-employed surrogate endpoint of relapse-free survival all hold for breast cancer disease-specific survival.",
                                "Although the patients from this cohort were treated more than 20 years ago, the findings from this study remain relevant to the treatment of breast cancer patients with a moderate risk of relapse. Such patients may derive significant benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy but the further addition of chemotherapy may have modest effects (2-5% improvement in 10-year relapse free survival). While the decision to pursue adjuvant chemotherapy is an individual decision made by the patient and consulting oncologist, improved prognostication will facilitate therapeutic decision making.",
                                "A Risk of Relapse score was developed and validated on microarray data from node negative patients who received no adjuvant systemic therapy (Example 2), against the endpoint of relapse-free survival. This algorithm is shown to predict pathologic complete response in a published neoadjuvant T/FAC clinical trial dataset of 133 patients, and, in its qPCR format, to predict relapse-free survival in a cohort of 279 heterogeneously-treated women with breast cancer. ROR scores generated by qPCR from paraffin block specimens are also prognostic in tamoxifen-treated, estrogen positive women, in both node-negative and node-positive subsets. ROR-C identifies a group of low risk patients among whom even nodal status is not a predictor, and who might therefore not require treatment approaches usually reserved for node positive patients including, for example, third generation chemotherapy regimens and chest wall radiation.",
                                "Very few cases (1.3%) are classified as Normal-like using the PCR assay, as compared to 12% when the PAM50 classifier is applied to DNA microarray data from large sets of primary breast cancers. DNA microarray analyses utilize homogenized tumor specimens that, despite gross dissection to enrich for tumor, may still contain significant amounts of normal breast tissue. In contrast, the PAM50 qPCR assay is performed on a pathologist-guided tissue core, based on direct microscopic identification of a representative area of pure tumor in the source block. This difference likely accounts for the much lower frequency of Normal-like profiles obtained using the PAM50 qPCR method applied to paraffin blocks. Review of the histology, as represented on tissue microarray cores extracted from the immediately adjacent tissue, is consistent with inadequate tumor representation being responsible for a normal-like profile in eight of the nine normal-like cases.",
                                "As was previously noted based on interrogation of published datasets with the PAM50 classifier, this assay identifies ER-negative biological subtypes among clinically ER positive women even in a setting where the tumor is positive by both immunohistochemical and ligand-binding assays. Fully 10% of cases are re-assigned to non-luminal subtypes, and these tamoxifen-treated women had poor outcomes, compatible with a biological reality of hormone independence. Clinical measurements of ER and HER2 status, on their own, can stratify breast cancer patients into prognostic and predictive subgroups[Hayes 2007]. Nevertheless, relying on measurements of single genes (ER, PR) to assign breast cancer prognosis and treatment risks not only the problems of false positive and negative single measurements, but also the possibility that a tumor's underlying biology may be hormone independent (despite one member of the pathway being expressed at the protein level). In this respect, the information provided by concurrently measuring 50 genes, including others in the estrogen response pathway together with positive markers of other biological subtypes, is likely to be a more accurate reflection of the underlying tumor biology [Oh 2006].",
                                "Larger immunohistochemical surrogate panels have been linked to expression profile gold standards and can provide more information than simple measurement of ER, PR and HER2 [Cheang 2008b][Cheang 2009]. Limited antibody panels are easily applied to standard paraffin blocks, and can add significant prognostic information beyond standard clinicopathologic risk factors [Ross 2008]. In this study, a direct comparison of an established six immunostain panel (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor) against the 50 gene qPCR assay, was made using the same source blocks. Each method adds significant prognostic information beyond standard factors. However, in this set of clinically ER positive patients, there were many discrepant assignments to an intinsic biological subtype, and the qPCR approach was better at predicting outcome in these cases.",
                                "In multivariate analysis incorporating the main clinical risk factors, grade is no longer significant when PAM50 subtype or ROR is included. In comparison with other signatures such as the recurrence score and genomic grade indexes [Paik 2004] [Ivshina 2006] [Sotiriou 2006], the PAM50 also has the advantage of discriminating high risk cases into Luminal B, HER2-Enriched and Basal-like subtypes, who are likely to respond differently to systemic therapy options (for example, hormonal, anti-HER2, and anthracycline vs. non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimens). The assay is also easier to perform, as it does not require frozen tissue [Glas 2006] nor manual microdissection of cut sections [Paik 2004] and can be readily applied to standard paraffin blocks including archival tissues such as those from clinical trials. However, the assay can be performed on these types of samples if desired. Because the PAM50 assay was designed to reflect the major features of the underlying biology of breast cancer, as opposed to being optimized against outcome in a particular population, it is particularly likely to extrapolate well onto other patient cohorts, and remain predictive [Rouzier 2005]. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the PAM50 qPCR assay has significant and independent prognostic capacity among estrogen receptor positive, tamoxifen treated women, whether node positive or node negative. The assay identifies up to 10% cases that were clinically determined to be ER positive (by immunohistochemistry and ligand-binding assay) as falling into ER negative high-risk groups, replaces grade and HER2 status in multivariate prognostic models, and is superior to immunohistochemical subtyping and clinical risk classifiers."
