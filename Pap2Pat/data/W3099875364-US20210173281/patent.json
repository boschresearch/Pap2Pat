                        "In the present section some working embodiments of the electro-optical modulator of the first aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to the Figures.",
                        "Specifically, in FIGS. 1 and 2 embodiments for which the modulator has only one waveguide are disclosed, while in FIGS. 10A to 10E an embodiment for which the modulator has two waveguides is disclosed, particularly to implement different Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangements.",
                        "As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, for the embodiment there illustrated, the electro-optical modulator comprises:\n\n\n- - a semiconductor substrate S, which is usually covered by a thin\n    layer (usually of about 20 nm-thin), called cladding (not shown),\n    made of an oxide material, such as SiO\u2082;\n  - first E**1** and second electrodes E**2** distanced from each other\n    along an X-direction (see FIG. 2), and subjected to a drain-source\n    voltage as shown in FIG. 1;\n  - an optical waveguide W embedded within the semiconductor substrate S\n    with an upper face flush (although if not flush, the modulator shall\n    also properly operate) with an upper face of the semiconductor\n    substrate S, wherein, for the illustrated embodiment, the upper face\n    of the optical waveguide W is located just below a location between\n    the first E**1** and second E**2** electrodes, along the\n    X-direction, wherein the optical waveguide W longitudinally extends\n    along a direction transversal (preferably perpendicular) to the\n    X-direction;\n  - a bottom graphene sheet Gb arranged and extending along the\n    X-direction over a portion of the upper face of the semiconductor\n    substrate S, with a first end electrically connected to the first\n    electrode E**1** and without the bottom graphene sheet Gb reaching\n    the second electrode E**2**;\n  - a sheet DS of a first dielectric material extending over the bottom\n    graphene sheet Gb contacting both the first E**1** and the second\n    E**2** electrodes;\n  - a top graphene sheet Gu arranged and extending along the X-direction\n    over a portion of the sheet DS of a first dielectric material, with\n    a first end electrically connected to the second electrode E**2**\n    and without the top graphene sheet Gu reaching the first electrode\n    E**1**; and\n  - a second dielectric material, with at least dielectric properties\n    different to the dielectric properties of said first dielectric\n    material, covering upper and bottom faces of the top graphene sheet\n    Gu and/or an upper face or both upper and bottom faces of the bottom\n    graphene sheet Gb.",
                        "For the illustrated embodiment, each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide W, and beyond through a respective further projecting portion, identified with the referrals pu and pb, respectively.",
                        "Each of those projecting portions pu, pb has a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the optical waveguide W width, identified with the referral \u201ca\u201d. In FIG. 2, those projecting portions pu, pb seem to be longer, but that's just a schematic representation which cannot be used to extract a teaching concerning a dimension from a measurement therein. Indeed, projecting portions pu and pb have a length of up to 25% the width \u201ca\u201d.",
                        "Alternatively, for non-illustrated embodiments, each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction above only part of the width of the optical waveguide W, particularly above a part which ranges from 50% to 100% of the width \u201ca\u201d of the optical waveguide W.",
                        "In the present document, and particularly in the diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, the terms \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d has been used to refer to the above described extension along the X-direction of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets, although in this case in absolute terms (i.e. not by means of percentages), for a width \u201ca\u201d for the optical waveguide W of 1 \u03bcm.",
                        "Particularly, positive values for the \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d correspond to values of the above mentioned length of each of the projecting portions pu and pb. A waveform with a \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d of 1000 nm (i.e. for a projecting portion with a length of 100% the width \u201ca\u201d) is shown which is not part of the present invention, but depicted only for comparison purposes with the rest of waveforms.",
                        "The \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d negative values refer to the above described embodiment for which each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction above only part ranging from 50% to 100% of the width a of the optical waveguide W. Particularly, each negative value correspond to a length value, measured along the X-direction, of the distance existing between the free edge of the corresponding graphene sheet (top Gu or bottom Gb) and the edge of the waveguide W towards which the graphene sheet is extending but does not arrive to. In other words, for a width \u201ca\u201d of 1 \u03bcm, a \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d of \u2212225 nm corresponds with a part of a 77.5% of the width \u201ca\u201d along which the corresponding graphene sheet extend along the X-direction.",
                        "By comparing the results of the diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, one can see how slightly varying the \u201cgraphene broadening\u201d has a great impact in the increase of the operating optical bandwidth while the optical transmission is only slightly reduced.",
                        "The present inventors have discovered that this is due to the fact that the region where the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets overlap has a capacitance C that is directly proportional to its dimensions. The bandwidth of the modulator is defined as BW=1/ 2\u03c0RC. The smaller the overlap between the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets, the lower the C, thus increasing the bandwidth (this is directly seen in FIG. 4). From the other side, a lower C, i.e. a lower overlapped region, will have a worst transmission (as seen FIG. 3).",
                        "The diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, and also those of FIGS. 5, 6, 7 and 8, have been obtained from numerical simulations for an electro-optical modulator for which the first dielectric material is HfO2 and the second electro-optical material is hBN. However, similar results can be obtained for other types of dielectric materials, such as for those cited in a previous section of this document.",
                        "For the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2:\n\n\n- - top M**4** and bottom M**3** sheets of the second dielectric\n    material sandwich the top graphene sheet Gu, contact the second\n    electrode E**2** and extend, along the X-direction, up to at least\n    just above and just below, respectively, a top graphene Gu free\n    edge, and\n  - top M**2** and a bottom M**1** sheets of the second dielectric\n    material sandwiching the bottom graphene sheet Gb, contact the first\n    electrode E**1** and extend, along the X-direction, up to just above\n    and just below, respectively, a bottom graphene Gb free edge.",
                        "The diagrams of FIGS. 5 and 6 respectively show the effect of the top sheet M4 thickness and of the bottom sheet M1 thickness (including a zero-thickness M1 sheet case). The results illustrated in those diagrams show that, for the M4 top sheet, the thicker the better, and that for the M1 bottom sheet, the thinner the better.",
                        "The influence of the thickness of the sheet DS of a first dielectric material is shown in FIG. 7, for which the first dielectric material is HfO2. The total thickness of the dielectric sheets (all of them, the ones of the first dielectric material and the ones of the second dielectric material) has been kept constant, so that when the thickness of HfO2 has been increased, the thickness of the M2 and/or M3 sheets has been proportionally reduced. The results show how for the DS sheet, the higher percentage the better.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows how the order of the different dielectric sheets within the top and bottom graphene sheets (only M3, M2 and DS have been taken into account) has no influence in the optical transmission. This is due to the fact that, for the simulations, M1 and M2 are the same materials and what matters is their total thickness.",
                        "The influence of the thickness of dielectric material within the top and bottom graphene sheets (M3+M2+DS) is shown in FIG. 9, showing that the smaller the thickness the better. The relative thickness (percentage) of each dielectric sheet has been kept constant.",
                        "The influence of the thickness of the whole dielectric material (Ml+M2+M3+M4+DS) is shown in FIG. 9, showing that the higher the thickness, the better. The relative thickness (percentage) of each dielectric sheet has been kept constant.",
                        "FIGS. 10A to 10E schematically show different variants and/or implementations of an embodiment for which the electro-optical modulator according to the first aspect of present invention implements a Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangement (the arrangements depicted in FIGS. 10A to 10E also represent embodiments of the third aspect of the present invention), wherein the optical waveguide W is a first optical waveguide branch W1, and the modulator further comprises:\n\n\n- - a second optical waveguide branch W**2** distanced from the first\n    optical waveguide branch W**1** along the X-direction and embedded\n    within the semiconductor substrate S, wherein the second optical\n    waveguide branch W**2** longitudinally extends along at least the\n    direction transversal to the X-direction; and\n  - a third electrode E**3** located distanced from the second electrode\n    E**2** along the X-direction, wherein, for the illustrated\n    embodiment the upper face of the second optical waveguide branch\n    W**2** is located below a location between said second E**2** and\n    third electrodes E**3**, along the X-direction.",
                        "For the variant shown in FIG. 10A, the second optical waveguide branch W2 is left uncovered, just embedded within the substrate S. Therefore, in use, i.e. when a voltage V1 is applied between the first E1 and the second E2 electrodes, only the phase of the light travelling through the core of the first optical waveguide branch W1 is changed.",

                        "The differences between the variants of FIGS. 10B and 10C are just the electrodes to which the terminals of voltage source V1 is applied, as voltage source V2 is applied to the same electrodes for both figures. For FIG. 10B, voltage V1 is applied to the second electrode E2 while the first E1 electrode is connected to ground, and for FIG. 10C the inverse connection is made.",
