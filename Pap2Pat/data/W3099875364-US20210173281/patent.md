## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally relates, in a first aspect, to an electro-optical modulator, and more particularly to a double layer graphene modulator having an optimized arrangement to provide both a large electro-optical bandwidth and enhanced optical transmission.

A second aspect of the present invention relates to a method for obtaining the electro-optical modulator of the first aspect of the invention.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

An electro-optical modulator comprising the following features is known in the art:


- - a semiconductor substrate;
  - at least first and second electrodes distanced from each other along
    an X-direction;
  - an optical waveguide at least partially embedded within and/or
    arranged on the semiconductor substrate, an upper face of said
    optical waveguide being located at, below or above a location
    between said first and second electrodes, along said X-direction,
    wherein said optical waveguide longitudinally extends along at least
    a direction transversal (generally perpendicular) to said
    X-direction;
  - a bottom graphene sheet arranged and extending along the X-direction
    over at least a portion of the upper face of the semiconductor
    substrate, with a first end electrically connected to said first
    electrode and without the bottom graphene sheet reaching the second
    electrode;
  - a sheet of a first dielectric material extending over said bottom
    graphene sheet;
  - a top graphene sheet arranged and extending along the X-direction
    over at least a portion of said sheet of a first dielectric
    material, with a first end electrically connected to said second
    electrode and without the top graphene sheet reaching the first
    electrode; and
  - a second dielectric material, which is a two-dimensional material
    with at least dielectric properties different to the dielectric
    properties of said first dielectric material, covering upper and
    bottom faces of said top graphene sheet and/or an upper face or both
    upper and bottom faces of said bottom graphene sheet.

That known electro-optical modulator provides, in theory, good results regarding its optical transmission, which is not the case regarding its operating optical bandwidth, which is clearly improvable.

It is, therefore, necessary to provide an alternative to the state of the art which covers the gaps found therein, by providing an electro-optical modulator with an optimized arrangement for achieving a large optical bandwidth and a high optical modulation efficiency.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

To that end, the present invention relates to an electro-optical modulator comprising:


- - a semiconductor substrate;
  - at least first and second electrodes distanced from each other along
    an X-direction;
  - an optical waveguide at least partially embedded within and/or
    arranged on the semiconductor substrate, an upper face of said
    optical waveguide being located at, below or above a location
    between said first and second electrodes, along said X-direction,
    wherein said optical waveguide longitudinally extends along at least
    a direction transversal (generally perpendicular) to said
    X-direction;
  - a bottom graphene sheet arranged and extending along the X-direction
    over at least a portion of the upper face of the semiconductor
    substrate, with a first end electrically connected to said first
    electrode and without the bottom graphene sheet reaching the second
    electrode;
  - a sheet of a first dielectric material extending over said bottom
    graphene sheet;
  - a top graphene sheet arranged and extending along the X-direction
    over at least a portion of said sheet of a first dielectric
    material, with a first end electrically connected to said second
    electrode and without the top graphene sheet reaching the first
    electrode; and
  - a second dielectric material, which is a two-dimensional material
    with at least dielectric properties different to the dielectric
    properties of said first dielectric material, covering upper and
    bottom faces of said top graphene sheet and/or an upper face or both
    upper and bottom faces of said bottom graphene sheet.

In contrast to the electro-optical modulator known in the prior art, in the one of the present invention at least one of the top and bottom graphene sheets extends along the X-direction:


- - above part of the width of the optical waveguide, wherein said part
    ranges from 50% to 100% of the width of the optical waveguide; or
  - completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide, and
    beyond through a respective further projecting portion with a
    length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the optical waveguide
    width.

For an embodiment, the top graphene sheet extends along the X-direction completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide, and beyond through a respective further projecting portion with a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the optical waveguide width.

For another embodiment, the bottom graphene sheet extends along the X-direction completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide, and beyond through a respective further projecting portion with a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the optical waveguide width.

For a preferred embodiment, particularly when there is only one waveguide, each of the top and bottom graphene sheets meets the above stated requirements regarding their extension along the X-direction above part of the width of the optical waveguide or completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide and beyond.

For an embodiment, at least one, or both, of the top and bottom graphene sheets extends along the X-direction from a 75% to a 100% above the optical waveguide width, or completely above the optical waveguide width and beyond through a further projecting portion with a length of up to a 25% of the optical waveguide width.

For an implementation of said embodiment, at least one of the top and bottom graphene sheets extend along the X-direction from a 95% to a 100% above the optical waveguide width, or completely above the optical waveguide width and beyond through a further projecting portion with a length of up to a 5% of the optical waveguide width.

For an embodiment, at least one of the top and bottom graphene sheets extends along the X-direction from a 50% to a 95% above the optical waveguide width.

According to a preferred embodiment, the top and bottom graphene sheets extend along the X-direction the same length.

Alternatively, the top and bottom graphene sheets have different lengths.

For an embodiment, the semiconductor substrate is covered by a thin layer called cladding, made of an oxide material, such as SiO2.

For an embodiment of the electro-optical modulator of the first aspect of the present invention:

    X-direction at least within an area overlapped by both the top and
    the bottom graphene sheets; and
  - a bottom sheet (when there is only a bottom sheet) of said second
    dielectric material covering the lower face of the top graphene
    sheet, or a top and bottom sheets (when both exist, the top and the
    bottom sheets) of said second dielectric material sandwiching the
    top graphene sheet, contact the second electrode and extend, along
    the X-direction, up to at least a top graphene free edge, and/or
  - a top sheet (when there is only a top sheet) of the second
    dielectric material covering the upper face of the bottom graphene
    sheet or a top and a bottom sheets (when both exist, the top and the
    bottom sheets) of the second dielectric material sandwiching the
    bottom graphene sheet, contact the first electrode and extend, along
    the X-direction, up to at least just above (when there is only a top
    sheet) or just above and just below (when both exist, the top and
    the bottom sheets), respectively, a bottom graphene free edge.

For three different implementations of that embodiment:


- - the sheet of a first dielectric material extends along the
    X-direction over the bottom graphene sheet and beyond, so that first
    and second opposite ends of the sheet of a first dielectric material
    respectively contact the first and the second electrode; or
  - the sheet of a first dielectric material extends along the
    X-direction over the bottom graphene sheet up to just above a bottom
    graphene free edge; or
  - the sheet of a first dielectric material extends along the
    X-direction occupying only the above mentioned area overlapped by
    both the top and the bottom graphene sheets, i.e. between just below
    the top graphene free edge and just above the bottom graphene free
    edge.

For different implementations (which can be combined with any of the above described three implementations) of the above mentioned embodiment, the top and bottom sheets of the second dielectric material which sandwich the top graphene sheet, contact the second electrode and extend, along the X-direction, just above and just below, respectively, the top graphene, or up to the first electrode, or up to any intermediate point between them.

    sheet, the bottom graphene sheet, ranges from 0 nm to 10 nm; and
  - the thickness of the bottom sheet sandwiching, together with the top
    sheet, the top graphene sheet, added to the thickness of the top
    sheet sandwiching, together with the bottom sheet, the bottom
    graphene sheet, ranges from 2 nm to 40 nm.

According to an embodiment, the total dielectric thickness, including the thickness of the sheet of a first dielectric material and the thickness of the second dielectric material, ranges from 9 nm to 30 nm.

    with a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the width of
    the second optical waveguide branch.

For a variant of the above described implementation:

    stepped-down portion of the top graphene sheet, and is arranged and
    extends from the first end of the top graphene sheet, along the
    X-direction, over said portion of the upper face of the
    semiconductor substrate and over at least said portion of the second
    optical waveguide branch, without reaching the third electrode; and
  - the further top graphene sheet has a first end electrically
    connected to the third electrode and extends therefrom along the
    X-direction without reaching the second electrode.

For another variant of said implementation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangement embodiment:

    connected to the third electrode and extends therefrom along the
    X-direction, over at least said portion of the upper face of the
    semiconductor substrate and over at least said portion of the second

  - the further sheet of the first dielectric material is integral with
    the sheet of the first dielectric material; and
  - the further top graphene sheet (which can be integral with the top
    graphene sheet, or a separate sheet) has a region electrically
    connected to the second electrode and extends therefrom along the
    X-direction without reaching the third electrode.

For another variant of the implementation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangement embodiment, the electro-optical modulator further comprises a fourth electrode located between the second and third electrodes along the X-direction, wherein the upper face of the second optical waveguide branch is located at, below or above a location between said fourth and third electrodes, along the X-direction; and wherein:

Combinations of two or more of any of all the embodiments and implementations described in the present document are embraced by the present invention, in case those combinations are feasible and lead to a working embodiment.

For example, for the Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangement implementation described above and further below, any of the embodiments and implementations explained in the present document for an electro-optical modulator having only one waveguide can be applied to that Mach-Zehnder interferometer arrangement implementation, particularly any of the described combinations, materials, properties and dimensions of the different sheets of the electro-optical modulator can be applied to the different sheets arranged above and below the two waveguides of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer arrangement.

The present invention also relates, in a second aspect, to a method for obtaining an electro-optical modulator, comprising providing and arranging each of the components of the electro-optical modulator of the first aspect of the present invention according to any of its embodiments.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

In the present section some working embodiments of the electro-optical modulator of the first aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to the Figures.

Specifically, in FIGS. 1 and 2 embodiments for which the modulator has only one waveguide are disclosed, while in FIGS. 10A to 10E an embodiment for which the modulator has two waveguides is disclosed, particularly to implement different Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangements.

As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, for the embodiment there illustrated, the electro-optical modulator comprises:


- - a semiconductor substrate S, which is usually covered by a thin
    layer (usually of about 20 nm-thin), called cladding (not shown),
    made of an oxide material, such as SiO₂;
  - first E**1** and second electrodes E**2** distanced from each other
    along an X-direction (see FIG. 2), and subjected to a drain-source
    voltage as shown in FIG. 1;
  - an optical waveguide W embedded within the semiconductor substrate S
    with an upper face flush (although if not flush, the modulator shall
    also properly operate) with an upper face of the semiconductor
    substrate S, wherein, for the illustrated embodiment, the upper face
    of the optical waveguide W is located just below a location between
    the first E**1** and second E**2** electrodes, along the
    X-direction, wherein the optical waveguide W longitudinally extends
    along a direction transversal (preferably perpendicular) to the
    X-direction;
  - a bottom graphene sheet Gb arranged and extending along the
    X-direction over a portion of the upper face of the semiconductor
    substrate S, with a first end electrically connected to the first
    electrode E**1** and without the bottom graphene sheet Gb reaching
    the second electrode E**2**;
  - a sheet DS of a first dielectric material extending over the bottom
    graphene sheet Gb contacting both the first E**1** and the second
    E**2** electrodes;
  - a top graphene sheet Gu arranged and extending along the X-direction
    over a portion of the sheet DS of a first dielectric material, with
    a first end electrically connected to the second electrode E**2**
    and without the top graphene sheet Gu reaching the first electrode
    E**1**; and
  - a second dielectric material, with at least dielectric properties
    different to the dielectric properties of said first dielectric
    material, covering upper and bottom faces of the top graphene sheet
    Gu and/or an upper face or both upper and bottom faces of the bottom
    graphene sheet Gb.

For the illustrated embodiment, each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction completely above the whole width of the optical waveguide W, and beyond through a respective further projecting portion, identified with the referrals pu and pb, respectively.

Each of those projecting portions pu, pb has a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the optical waveguide W width, identified with the referral “a”. In FIG. 2, those projecting portions pu, pb seem to be longer, but that's just a schematic representation which cannot be used to extract a teaching concerning a dimension from a measurement therein. Indeed, projecting portions pu and pb have a length of up to 25% the width “a”.

Alternatively, for non-illustrated embodiments, each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction above only part of the width of the optical waveguide W, particularly above a part which ranges from 50% to 100% of the width “a” of the optical waveguide W.

In the present document, and particularly in the diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, the terms “graphene broadening” has been used to refer to the above described extension along the X-direction of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets, although in this case in absolute terms (i.e. not by means of percentages), for a width “a” for the optical waveguide W of 1 μm.

Particularly, positive values for the “graphene broadening” correspond to values of the above mentioned length of each of the projecting portions pu and pb. A waveform with a “graphene broadening” of 1000 nm (i.e. for a projecting portion with a length of 100% the width “a”) is shown which is not part of the present invention, but depicted only for comparison purposes with the rest of waveforms.

The “graphene broadening” negative values refer to the above described embodiment for which each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction above only part ranging from 50% to 100% of the width a of the optical waveguide W. Particularly, each negative value correspond to a length value, measured along the X-direction, of the distance existing between the free edge of the corresponding graphene sheet (top Gu or bottom Gb) and the edge of the waveguide W towards which the graphene sheet is extending but does not arrive to. In other words, for a width “a” of 1 μm, a “graphene broadening” of −225 nm corresponds with a part of a 77.5% of the width “a” along which the corresponding graphene sheet extend along the X-direction.

By comparing the results of the diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, one can see how slightly varying the “graphene broadening” has a great impact in the increase of the operating optical bandwidth while the optical transmission is only slightly reduced.

The present inventors have discovered that this is due to the fact that the region where the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets overlap has a capacitance C that is directly proportional to its dimensions. The bandwidth of the modulator is defined as BW=1/ 2πRC. The smaller the overlap between the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets, the lower the C, thus increasing the bandwidth (this is directly seen in FIG. 4). From the other side, a lower C, i.e. a lower overlapped region, will have a worst transmission (as seen FIG. 3).

The diagrams of FIGS. 3 and 4, and also those of FIGS. 5, 6, 7 and 8, have been obtained from numerical simulations for an electro-optical modulator for which the first dielectric material is HfO2 and the second electro-optical material is hBN. However, similar results can be obtained for other types of dielectric materials, such as for those cited in a previous section of this document.

For the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2:


- - top M**4** and bottom M**3** sheets of the second dielectric
    material sandwich the top graphene sheet Gu, contact the second
    electrode E**2** and extend, along the X-direction, up to at least
    just above and just below, respectively, a top graphene Gu free
    edge, and
  - top M**2** and a bottom M**1** sheets of the second dielectric
    material sandwiching the bottom graphene sheet Gb, contact the first
    electrode E**1** and extend, along the X-direction, up to just above
    and just below, respectively, a bottom graphene Gb free edge.

The diagrams of FIGS. 5 and 6 respectively show the effect of the top sheet M4 thickness and of the bottom sheet M1 thickness (including a zero-thickness M1 sheet case). The results illustrated in those diagrams show that, for the M4 top sheet, the thicker the better, and that for the M1 bottom sheet, the thinner the better.

The influence of the thickness of the sheet DS of a first dielectric material is shown in FIG. 7, for which the first dielectric material is HfO2. The total thickness of the dielectric sheets (all of them, the ones of the first dielectric material and the ones of the second dielectric material) has been kept constant, so that when the thickness of HfO2 has been increased, the thickness of the M2 and/or M3 sheets has been proportionally reduced. The results show how for the DS sheet, the higher percentage the better.

FIG. 8 shows how the order of the different dielectric sheets within the top and bottom graphene sheets (only M3, M2 and DS have been taken into account) has no influence in the optical transmission. This is due to the fact that, for the simulations, M1 and M2 are the same materials and what matters is their total thickness.

The influence of the thickness of dielectric material within the top and bottom graphene sheets (M3+M2+DS) is shown in FIG. 9, showing that the smaller the thickness the better. The relative thickness (percentage) of each dielectric sheet has been kept constant.

The influence of the thickness of the whole dielectric material (Ml+M2+M3+M4+DS) is shown in FIG. 9, showing that the higher the thickness, the better. The relative thickness (percentage) of each dielectric sheet has been kept constant.

FIGS. 10A to 10E schematically show different variants and/or implementations of an embodiment for which the electro-optical modulator according to the first aspect of present invention implements a Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangement (the arrangements depicted in FIGS. 10A to 10E also represent embodiments of the third aspect of the present invention), wherein the optical waveguide W is a first optical waveguide branch W1, and the modulator further comprises:


- - a second optical waveguide branch W**2** distanced from the first
    optical waveguide branch W**1** along the X-direction and embedded
    within the semiconductor substrate S, wherein the second optical
    waveguide branch W**2** longitudinally extends along at least the
    direction transversal to the X-direction; and
  - a third electrode E**3** located distanced from the second electrode
    E**2** along the X-direction, wherein, for the illustrated
    embodiment the upper face of the second optical waveguide branch
    W**2** is located below a location between said second E**2** and
    third electrodes E**3**, along the X-direction.

For the variant shown in FIG. 10A, the second optical waveguide branch W2 is left uncovered, just embedded within the substrate S. Therefore, in use, i.e. when a voltage V1 is applied between the first E1 and the second E2 electrodes, only the phase of the light travelling through the core of the first optical waveguide branch W1 is changed.

For the rest of variant, i.e. for those of FIGS. 10B to 10E, in use, the phase of the light travelling through the cores of both optical waveguide branches, W1 and W2, is changed, and the electro-optical modulator further comprises:


- - a further bottom graphene sheet Gbf arranged and extending, along
    the X-direction, over at least a portion of the upper face of the
    semiconductor substrate S and over at least a portion of the second
    optical waveguide branch W**2**;
  - a further sheet DSf of said first dielectric material extending
    along the X-direction over the further bottom graphene sheet Gbf;
  - a further top graphene sheet Guf arranged and extending along the
    X-direction over at least a portion of the further sheet DSf of the
    first dielectric material and over at least a portion of the second
    optical waveguide branch W**2**; and
  - further portions of the second dielectric material covering upper
    and bottom faces of said further top graphene sheet Guf and/or an
    upper face or upper and bottom faces of said further bottom graphene
    sheet Gbf.

One or both of the further top Guf and further bottom Gbf graphene sheets extends along the X-direction:


- - above part of the width of the second optical waveguide branch
    W**2**, wherein said part ranges from 50% to 100% of the width of
    the second optical waveguide branch W**2**; or
  - completely above the whole width of the second optical waveguide
    branch W**2**, and beyond through a respective further projecting
    portion with a length, along the X direction, of up to 25% of the
    width of the second optical waveguide branch W**2**.

Specifically, for the variant illustrated by FIGS. 10B and 10C:


- - the further bottom graphene sheet Gbf has a first end electrically
    connected to the third electrode E**3** and extends therefrom along
    the X-direction, over only a portion of the upper face of the
    semiconductor substrate S and, in this case, above the whole width
    of the second optical waveguide branch W**2** and beyond through a
    respective further projecting portion with a length, along the X
    direction, of up to 25% of the width of second optical waveguide
    branch W**2**, although, as stated above, it could extend above only
    a part ranging from 50% to 100% of that width;
  - said further sheet DSf of said first dielectric material is integral
    with said sheet DS of said first dielectric material; and
  - said further top graphene sheet Guf has a first end electrically
    connected to the second electrode E**2** and extends therefrom along
    the X-direction without reaching the third electrode E**3**, in this
    case, above the whole width of the second optical waveguide branch
    W**2** and beyond (up to 25% its width), although, as stated above,
    it could extend above only a part ranging from 50% to 100% of that
    width.

Alternatively, for a non-illustrated embodiment, each of the top Gu and bottom Gb graphene sheets extends along the X-direction above only part of the width of the second optical waveguide branch W2, particularly above a part which ranges from 50% to 100% of the width of the second optical waveguide branch W2.

The differences between the variants of FIGS. 10B and 10C are just the electrodes to which the terminals of voltage source V1 is applied, as voltage source V2 is applied to the same electrodes for both figures. For FIG. 10B, voltage V1 is applied to the second electrode E2 while the first E1 electrode is connected to ground, and for FIG. 10C the inverse connection is made.

For the variant illustrated by FIG. 10D, the electro-optical modulator further comprises a fourth electrode E4 located between the second E2 and third E3 electrodes along the X-direction, wherein the upper face of the second optical waveguide branch W2 is located below a location between the fourth E4 and third electrodes E3, along the X-direction; and wherein:


- - the further bottom graphene sheet Gbf is integral with the bottom
    graphene sheet Gb, so that opposite ends of the resulting common
    graphene sheet are respectively electrically connected to the first
    E**1** and the third E**3** electrode, extending along the
    X-direction over the upper face of the substrate S and above the
    whole width of both the first W and the second W**2** optical
    waveguide branches;
  - the further sheet DSf of the first dielectric material is integral
    with the sheet DS of the first dielectric material; and
  - the further top graphene sheet Guf has a first end electrically
    connected to the fourth electrode E**4** and extends therefrom along
    the X-direction without reaching the third electrode E**3**, in this
    case above the whole width of the second optical waveguide branch
    W**2** and beyond (up to 25% its width), although, as stated above,
    it could extend above only a part ranging from 50% to 100% of that
    width.

For the variant of FIG. 10D, the voltage sources V1 and V2 are connected the same as for that of FIG. 10B.

As shown in FIG. 10E, for the variant there illustrated:


- - the further bottom graphene sheet Gbf has a first end electrically
    connected to the third electrode E**3** and extends therefrom along
    the X-direction, over a portion of the upper face of the
    semiconductor substrate S, and, in this case, above the whole width
    of the second optical waveguide branch W**2** and beyond (up to 25%
    its width), although, as stated above, it could extend above only a
    part ranging from 50% to 100% of that width;
  - the further sheet DSf of the first dielectric material is integral
    with the sheet DS of the first dielectric material and the resulting
    common sheets extends from the first E**1** to the third E**3**
    electrodes; and
  - the further top graphene sheet Guf is integral with the top graphene
    sheet Gu, so a central region of the resulting common graphene sheet
    is electrically connected to the second electrode E**2**, and both
    opposite ends extend, along the X-direction over the upper face of
    the substrate S, towards the first E**1** and the third E**3**
    electrodes, respectively, so that, in this case, each, Gu and Guf,
    extends above the whole width of the first W**1** or second W**2**
    optical waveguide branch and beyond (up to 25% its width), although,
    as stated above, it could extend above only a part ranging from 50%
    to 100% of that width.

For the variant of FIG. 10E, three voltages are applied, namely V1, V2 and V3, each to a respective of the first E1, second E2 and third E3 electrodes.

As state above, FIGS. 10A to 10Eare schematic, which means, for example, that those elements depicted floating are not floating but really bent.

The operation of the modulators of FIGS. 10A to 10E is the already known associated to Mach-Zehnder interferometer based arrangements together with the one already explained above for the modulator of FIGS. 1 and 2, i.e. it benefits from the same effects explained above with respect to the “graphene broadening”.

A person skilled in the art could introduce changes and modifications in the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the invention as it is defined in the attached claims.
