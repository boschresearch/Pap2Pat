    "date": "2020-11-09",
    "abstract": "Electro-absorption (EA) waveguide-coupled modulators are essential building blocks for on-chip optical communications. Compared to state-of-the-art silicon (Si) devices, graphene based EA modulators promise smaller footprints, larger temperature stability, cost-effective integration and high speeds. However, combining high speed and large modulation efficiencies in a single graphene-based device has remained elusive so far. In this work, we overcome this fundamental trade-off by demonstrating the first 2D-3D dielectric integration in a high-quality encapsulated graphene device. We integrated hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ) and two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within the insulating section of a double-layer (DL) graphene EA modulator. This novel combination of materials allows for a high-quality modulator device with record high performances: a \u223c39GHz bandwidth (BW) with a three-fold increase in modulation efficiency compared to previously reported high speed modulators. This first demonstration of 2D-3D integration paves the way to a plethora of electronic and opto-electronic devices with enhanced performance and stability, while expanding the freedom for new device designs.",

                "Broadband optical modulators with ultra-high-speed, low-drive voltage, and hysteresis-free operation are key devices for next-generation datacom transceivers1. Although Si photonics is nowadays a prime candidate to fulfill these requirements2,3, graphene is rapidly becoming a major contender in several optoelectronic applications, such as ultrafast modulators4,5 and silicon-integrated photodetectors6,7. Graphene-based modulators have already proven broadband optical bandwidth1, high speed8,9, relatively high modulation efficiencies10, and temperature stability8. These devices are all based on complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material7,10\u201313, where CMOS design and fabrication techniques can be further leveraged to decrease costs. However, graphene-based modulators are yet to demonstrate all operation requirements at once. More specifically, EA graphene modulators struggle to show high-speed and high modulation efficiencies simultaneously14. This bottleneck is mostly due to the weak graphene/dielectric combination and the limited quality of graphene.",
                "Unlike Si technology, where high-\u03ba dielectrics lie at the core of its success, 2D dielectrics are hindering the development of graphene- and other 2D-based electronics and optoelectronic devices1,13,15 and are clearly outperformed by traditional 3D high-\u03ba dielectrics. This underperforming 2D-dielectric/graphene combination deepens even further the fundamental trade-off between speed and modulation efficiency inherent to the double-layer (DL) modulators14. In the DL architecture, the overlapped top and bottom graphene electrodes act as a capacitor (C). The larger the C, the higher the modulation efficiency. On the other hand, the speed of the modulator defined as f3dB\u2009=\u20091/(2\u03c0RC) is inversely proportional to C (R being the total resistance). In this framework, the quality of graphene appears as a valid turnaround to overcome this fundamental limitation. High electron mobility is expected to minimize the overall resistance and reduce the insertion loss (IL)1,9, thus increasing the bandwidth and the extinction ratio (ER). However, the quality of graphene is very sensitive to its environment, e.g., the dielectric to encapsulate it. Indeed, no graphene/dielectric combination has been able to ensure high charge carrier mobilities and low levels of residual doping in existing graphene waveguide-coupled modulators16. The growth of nonlayered (i.e., 3D) dielectrics, e.g., aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon nitride (\\(SiN\\) ), or HfO2 directly on top of graphene leads to low electronic mobility16\u201318 and/or inhomogeneous doping19.",
                "In this work, we demonstrate the 2D\u20133D integration of hBN and HfO2 within the dielectric section of a DL graphene EA modulator. This dielectric combination enhances the capacitance of the EA modulators without compromising their robustness against high voltages and preserves the high mobility and low doping of intrinsic graphene. As a result, we achieved a static and dynamic (at 40\u2009Gbps) modulation efficiency as high as 2.2 and 1.49\u2009dBV\u22121, respectively, a f3dB bandwidth of ~39\u2009GHz, and a device footprint of 60\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.45\u2009\u03bcm \u2248 27\u2009\u03bcm2 (neglecting the metal pads and graphene leads). Moreover, the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN-based devices show a symmetric and nearly hysteresis-free operation. The larger breakdown voltage of this 2D\u20133D dielectric, even beyond the full transparency regime (i.e., Pauli blocking), increases the ER and reduces the IL of the modulators."

                "The EA modulators were fabricated on top of a photonic structure20 formed by two grating couplers21 feeding light in and out of an optical waveguide (Fig.\u00a01a). The 750-nm-wide waveguide for the device in Fig.\u00a01 was designed to support a single transverse\u2013magnetic (TM) optical mode20 (see Supplementary Note\u00a03). The presented DL graphene modulators were built, with hBN-encapsulated graphene top and bottom electrodes (Fig.\u00a01d). The hBN\u2013graphene\u2013hBN stacks have been fabricated following state-of-the-art fabrication techniques22,23. This ensured low levels of doping and high charge carrier mobilities. We characterized the quality of the resulting modulators (see Supplementary Notes\u00a02 and 6) and extracted a carrier density-independent mobility as high as 30,000\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 at room temperature23 (see Supplementary Note\u00a02).Fig. 1Device geometry and static characterization.a Optical image of a photonic device consisting of two grating couplers (GC), a silicon optical waveguide (Si WG), and an hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN-based graphene EA modulator on top (see zoom-in optical (panel b) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (panel c) images for details). In panel c, the metal contacts are yellow/brown and the bottom and top graphene electrodes violet and light blue, respectively. The core of the waveguide is highlighted by the green dashed lines. The white scale bars in panel a, b, and c are 100, 5, and 1\u2009\u03bcm, respectively. d Electrical connections and schematic cross-section of an EA modulator with an hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric. The top and bottom graphene electrodes are fully encapsulated by hBN (in green) protecting both graphene electrodes from the out-of-plane dangling bonds typical of 3D oxide materials, e.g., HfO2 (in red). See inset for a molecular representation. e Transmission curves as a function of the voltage between the bottom and top graphene electrodes (VBT axis, bottom) and the Fermi energy at the graphene electrodes (EF axis, top) for the EA modulator in panel a with an hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric (see sketch). The 1550\u00a0nm excitation power was set to 0\u2009dBm. The forward and backward voltage sweeps (black and blue, respectively) show no major hysteresis compared to a modulator with an hBN\u2013HfO2 dielectric (see inset). The red line is a linear fit to the forward voltage sweep within a 0.5\u00a0V voltage span (extracted slope: 2.2\u2009dBV\u22121).",
                "Although hBN-encapsulated graphene devices have allowed for device designs with unprecedented functionalities24\u201326 and improved performance23, such layered dielectric material typically contains impurities and/or crystal defects leading to low breakdown voltages27,28. Moreover, the dielectric permittivity of hBN is rather low compared to existing high-\u03ba dielectrics29, with a value close to that of SiO2 (\u03f5r ~ 4). This low dielectric constant and reduced breakdown voltage (see Supplementary Note\u00a05) compromises not only the power consumption and the ability to reach high modulation efficiencies at reasonably low drive voltages but also limits the IL and the ER of the modulators1,9. We thus integrate HfO2, a high-\u03ba dielectric material, within the hBN-encapsulated graphene electrodes (see the sketch in Fig.\u00a01d).",
                "With such hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric arrangement, graphene remains isolated from HfO2, shielded away from any possible out-of-plane dangling bonds of the 3D oxide material (see inset of Fig.\u00a01d for the molecular representation of the 2D\u20133D dielectric interface). More importantly, the hBN\u2013graphene interfaces remain atomically sharp and clean22,23,30. This nanoscale control of the interfaces brings further advantages to real-world EA graphene modulators, like a symmetric and hysteresis-free operation. This is directly visible in the transmission curves as a function of the applied voltage VBT or, alternatively, as a function of the Fermi energy EF at the graphene electrodes (see the bottom and top axis in Fig.\u00a01e and Supplementary Note\u00a09). Both forward and backward voltage sweeps (black and blue traces, respectively) show minor hysteresis and appear symmetric with respect to the charge neutrality point. For comparison, a device fabricated with a HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric shows no overlap between the forward and backward sweeps (inset of Fig.\u00a01e). This strong hysteresis is nonetheless expected for this HfO2\u2013hBN modulator since, in that case, the top graphene electrode is in direct contact with HfO2. The hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN modulator device exhibits a modulation efficiency as high as ~2.2\u2009dBV\u22121 within a 0.5\u00a0V voltage span (see red linear fit to the data in Fig.\u00a01e). Considering the length of our modulator (~60\u2009\u03bcm), we obtain a normalized static modulation efficiency of ~0.037\u2009dBV\u22121\u2009\u03bcm\u22121, a threefold increase compared to previously reported high-speed graphene EA modulators9.",
                "With such a high static modulation efficiency (Fig.\u00a01), one might expect the device speed to be compromised14. However, the high mobility of the hBN-encapsulated graphene is expected to increase the bandwidth. This is visible in Fig.\u00a02a, where we calculated the f3dB bandwidth as a function of the charge carrier-dependent mobility (\u03bc) and contact resistivity (\u03c1c) for a graphene modulator with the same geometry and dielectric combination as the device in Fig.\u00a01 (see Supplementary Note\u00a011). As observed, the graphene mobility and the contact resistivity have a major influence on the modulator speed. Considering the mobility \u03bc\u2009\u2248\u200912,000\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 (evaluated at VBT\u2009=\u200910.4\u2009V) and the contact resistivity \u03c1c\u2009\u2248\u2009800\u2009\u03a9\u2009\u03bcm achieved experimentally (see Supplementary Notes\u00a04 and 11), we expect a bandwidth of f3dB ~ 46\u2009GHz (dashed lines in Fig.\u00a02a). To confirm this value experimentally, we measured the electro-optical (EO) bandwidth of the device in Fig.\u00a01 at a DC voltage VBT\u2009=\u200910.4\u2009V and a peak-to-peak voltage VAC\u2009=\u2009200\u2009mV (Fig.\u00a02b). The bandwidth of the measured device attains f3dB\u2009\u2248\u200939\u2009GHz (without de-embedding, see Supplementary Note\u00a013). This value is close to the capabilities of our setup, limited to 40\u2009GHz by the vector network analyzer and the RF probes (see Supplementary Note\u00a012). Even though the measured f3dB does not reach the expected f3dB ~ 46\u2009GHz (Fig.\u00a02a), possibly due to an increased contact resistivity of the measuring device (see Supplementary Note\u00a011), this is still the highest f3dB bandwidth among all graphene-based modulators reported so far8,9,11,12,31,32.Fig. 2Dynamic characterization.a f3dB bandwidth as a function of the charge carrier-dependent mobility (\u03bc) and the contact resistivity (\u03c1c) calculated for a device with the same geometry and dielectric combination as the device in Fig.\u00a01 (see Supplementary Note\u00a011). The dashed lines indicate the expected f3dB ~46\u2009GHz at \u03bc ~12,000\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121\u2009(evaluated at VBT\u2009=\u200910.4\u2009V, refer to panel b). b Measured electro-optical S21 frequency response of the EA modulator at VBT\u2009=\u200910.4\u2009V and VAC\u2009=\u2009200\u2009mV, without de-embedding, i.e., including the contributions of the setup and photodetector (see Supplementary Note\u00a012). c In all, 231\u2009\u2212\u20091 pseudo-random binary sequence non-return-to-zero eye diagram at 28 and 40\u2009Gbps. The EA modulator is d.c. biased at VBT\u2009=\u200911\u2009V and driven by a VAC\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009V peak-to-peak RF signal. The eye diagram measured at 40\u2009Gbps has a 5.2\u00a0dB ER and a 2.28\u00a0dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The green arrows indicate the 0\u2009W baseline, and the white scale bar corresponds to 10\u2009ps.",
                "The high-speed operation of our modulator device is also supported by non-return-to-zero eye diagram measurements. The data were obtained through an electrical pattern generator (PG) driving the modulator with a 231\u2009\u2212\u20091 pseudo-random binary sequence at 28 and 40\u00a0Gbps bit-rate (see Supplementary Note\u00a013). The signal was driven by a 3.5-V peak-to-peak voltage while the DC bias was set to 11\u2009V. The device was terminated with a 50\u00a0\u03a9 load to avoid reflections due to the impedance mismatch between the PG electrical output and the modulator (when measured at 40\u2009Gbps). Open eye diagrams at 28 and 40\u2009Gbps are shown in Fig.\u00a02c, with an ER as high as 5.2\u2009dB and a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.28\u2009dB for the latter (see Supplementary Note\u00a014 for an eye diagram at 10\u2009Gbps). These results confirm the large modulation efficiency of our hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN-based modulator device, even at high speeds, with a dynamic modulation efficiency of 1.49\u2009dBV\u22121 at 40\u2009Gbps9.",
                "Like the speed of the modulator, the power consumption understood as the switching energy per bit also benefits from the small footprint of the device. Ignoring the parasitic pad capacitance, we obtain for the modulator in Fig.\u00a01 an energy per bit of \\(C\\left( V_{AC} \\right)^{2}/4 \\approx 160\\mspace{6mu}{fJbit}^{- 1}\\) , where C\u2009=\u200952\u2009fF is the capacitance between the top and bottom graphene electrodes and VAC\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009V the voltage swing12. This value of energy per bit is on par with state-of-the-art SiGe technologies33,34.",
                "To directly compare modulators with different dielectrics, it is more convenient to compare the transmission as a function of EF (see the EF axis in Figs.\u00a01e and\u00a03b and c) since EF already considers the thickness and the relative permittivity of the dielectric (see Supplementary Note\u00a07). Operating the modulators at high EF enhances both ER and IL, with the ER (IL) increasing (decreasing) as a function of EF9. In the full transparency regime (Pauli blocking, see Supplementary Note\u00a01), the ER is maximized and the IL is expected to become nearly zero for high-quality graphene1,9 (see Supplementary Note\u00a010). It is thus crucial to determine which dielectric materials facilitate Pauli blocking operation. Figure\u00a03a illustrates the expected maximum EF,\\(E_{F}^{\\max} = \\hslash v_{F}\\sqrt{\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\epsilon_{r}E_{BD}/q},\\) as a function of the relative permittivity (\u03f5r) and dielectric strength (EBD) of any given dielectric. The square boxes in Fig.\u00a03a enclose the expected \\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\)  for the HfO2\u2212 and hBN-based modulators (in red and green, respectively) and the black star represents the \\(E_{F}^{\\max} = 0.57\\) \u2009eV expected for the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN modulator of Fig.\u00a01e (see Supplementary Note\u00a010). The boundaries of the boxes are taken from literature28,35\u201337 (marked with dots) and from our dielectric characterization (marked with stars, see Supplementary Notes\u00a05 and 10). All\u00a0dielectric materials fulfilling \\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\  > \\ 0.5\\) \u2009eV (see white fringe in Fig.\u00a03a) allow full transparency, i.e., Pauli blocking. The comparison in Fig.\u00a03a highlights the advantages of the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric (black star), achieving higher EF values than the hBN dielectric while equally preserving the intrinsic qualities of graphene.Fig. 3Dielectric breakdown and Pauli blocking operation.a Maximum Fermi energy, noted \\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\) , expected at the graphene electrodes of a graphene modulator with a dielectric\u2019s relative permittivity \u03f5r and dielectric strength EBD. All points lying inside the blue-colored region represent a dielectric allowing for Pauli blocking operation (\\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\  > \\ 0.5\\) \u2009eV, refer to Supplementary Note\u00a01). The red-colored region indicates otherwise (\\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\  < \\ 0.5\\) \u2009eV). The white band represents the Pauli blocking boundary condition, defined as \\(E_{F}^{\\max} = 0.5\\) \u2009eV. The expected \\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\)  for HfO2 and hBN are represented by the red and green squares, respectively, taking the values of EBD and \u03f5r from literature28,35\u201337 (marked with dots) and our dielectric characterization (marked with stars, see Supplementary Notes\u00a05 and 10). The black star represents the \\(E_{F}^{\\max} = 0.57\\) \u2009eV expected for the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN modulator in Fig.\u00a01e (see Supplementary Note\u00a010). b, c Normalized transmission as a function of EF and VBT for modulators with hBN (b) and hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN (c) dielectric. The data points are measurements and the solid curves simulations (see Supplementary Notes\u00a01\u20133 and 10). The vertical dashed lines indicate the \\(E_{F}^{\\max}\\)  achieved at the dielectric breakdown. The orange-shaded regions show the full transparency range, i.e., Pauli blocking. The top VBT axis in panel b is for the 42\u00a0\u03bcm-long device only (see Supplementary Note\u00a07 for the other hBN devices). The graphene Dirac cones in panel b show the absorption and Pauli blocking processes at low and high Fermi energies, respectively.",
                "These results are confirmed by the transmission traces in Fig.\u00a03b, c. None of the hBN-based modulators were able to withstand Pauli blocking operation (orange-shaded region Fig.\u00a03b), all breaking their hBN dielectric at a similar \\(E_{F}^{\\max} \\approx 0.4\\) \u2009eV (see vertical dashed lines in Fig.\u00a03b and Supplementary Notes\u00a07 and 8). Even though these hBN-based modulators were too fragile, we obtained modulation efficiencies as high as 0.3, 1.3, and 2\u2009dBV\u22121 for device lengths L\u2009=\u200912, 24, and 42\u2009\u03bcm, respectively. Once normalized by its length, we obtain 0.025, 0.054, and 0.047\u2009dBV\u22121\u2009\u03bcm\u22121. These results exceed the state-of-the-art modulation efficiency of 0.038\u2009dBV\u22121\u2009\u03bcm\u2212110. Still, the premature hBN breakdown compromises the ER and the IL. Indeed, the measured ER\u2009=\u20090.75, 2.3, and 4.9\u2009dB (data points in Fig.\u00a03b) is far from the simulated ER\u2009=\u20091.8, 4.4, and 7.9\u2009dB (solid traces in Fig.\u00a03b) expected for the 12, 24, and 42\u00a0\u03bcm-long modulators, respectively (for simulations, refer to Supplementary Notes\u00a01\u20133). Likewise, the measured IL\u2009=\u20091, 2.2, and 3.4\u2009dB are higher than IL \u22480\u2009dB expected for high-mobility graphene modulators1 (see the minimum 0-dB normalized transmission, i.e., neglecting the losses from grating couplers and Si waveguide, achieved by the simulation traces in Fig.\u00a03b and Supplementary Note\u00a010).",
                "On the other hand, the second hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN modulator device attains the Pauli blocking regime (Fig.\u00a03c), in agreement with the dielectric characterization of hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Notes\u00a05 and 10), reaching a maximum Fermi energy of \\(E_{F}^{\\max} \\approx 0.54\\) \u2009eV. The ER and IL improve accordingly, with an ER\u2009=\u20097.8\u2009dB almost twice the value obtained by the hBN-based modulator of comparable length (compare the black and red traces of Fig.\u00a03c, b, respectively) and an IL reaching nearly zero (IL \u2248 0.04\u2009dB in Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Note\u00a010). However, being shorter (L\u2009=\u200944\u2009\u03bcm) than the device in Fig.\u00a01e (L\u2009=\u200960\u2009\u03bcm), the modulation efficiency is lower (1.3\u2009dBV\u22121 in a 0.5\u00a0V span, see Fig.\u00a03c). We note that the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN device of Fig.\u00a01e has a relatively weak measured ER \u2248 4.4\u2009dB and IL \u22487.8\u2009dB (see Supplementary Note\u00a010) due to an overcautious VBT\u2009=\u200912.1\u2009V applied voltage (or alternatively EF\u2009=\u20090.41\u2009eV). Considering the breakdown capabilities of hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric (black star in Fig.\u00a03a), we evaluated a potential ER \u2248 12\u2009dB and IL \u2248 0.042\u2009dB for this device (see Supplementary Note\u00a010)."

                "Although material platforms like lithium niobate38 (LiNbO3) or hybrid technologies like Si/indium phosphide39 (InP), Si/SiGe40, or InGaAlAs40 offer outstanding performances in modulator applications, those are either not scalable38,41 (LiNbO3) or their integration with a CMOS fabrication line remains challenging40,42. Nowadays, Si and graphene are envisaged as the most scalable, cost-effective, and CMOS-compatible materials for amplitude modulator applications1. To compare our results with state-of-the-art graphene and Si amplitude modulators, both EA and Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer configurations included, we summarize our results in Fig.\u00a04 and in Supplementary Notes\u00a015 and 16. Figure\u00a04 shows the dynamic modulation efficiency (extracted from the eye diagrams and normalized by the device length and drive voltage) as a function of the modulation speed (red axis and red data point in Fig.\u00a04) and the static modulation efficiency (measured in DC and normalized by the device length), as a function of the f3dB bandwidth (black axis and black data point in Fig.\u00a04). To avoid discrepancies due to the different extraction methods, we determine the static modulation efficiency of the compared literature8\u201312 using the same method as in Fig.\u00a01e, i.e., by applying a linear fit within a 0.5\u00a0V voltage span. The results highlight the trade-offs between speed and modulation efficiency and stress the advantages of an hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric to obtain large static and dynamic modulation efficiencies even at high speed. As observed, the modulation efficiency typically drops for devices with high speed8,9, being our device the only modulator able to operate at high speed with a large static and dynamic modulation efficiency (Fig.\u00a04). These results outperform state-of-the-art graphene and not-yet-commercial silicon-based electroabsorption modulators43\u201345 (see blue/red and green data clouds, respectively in Fig.\u00a04) when considering the modulation efficiency normalized by the length (i.e., footprint). This figure-of-merit is rather an important one since for many envisaged applications (e.g., chip interconnects), multiple modulator devices are expected to coexist on the same chip.Fig. 4Comparison with other optical modulators.The black and red data points and axis represent the static modulation efficiency as a function of the f3dB bandwidth and the dynamic modulation efficiency (extracted from eye diagrams) as a function of the modulation speed, respectively. The red, blue, and green data clouds enclose single-11,12,31,46 and double-layer8\u201310,32 graphene and silicon43\u201345 state-of-the-art modulators operating at \u03bb\u2009=\u20091.55\u2009\u03bcm.

                "In this work, we demonstrated the advantages of integrating hBN with a 3D high-\u03ba dielectric for high-quality graphene-based EA modulators. Compared to traditional oxide sputtering or atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth on top of graphene, the integration of HfO2 in-between hBN prevented any damage to the underlying graphene and allowed clean graphene\u2013hBN interfaces. These clean interfaces yielded a symmetric and nearly hysteresis-free operation. Moreover, this 2D\u20133D integration enabled full transparency while maintaining the high mobility and low doping of intrinsic graphene. More importantly, the hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN-based EA modulators were able to reach high modulation speeds with strong modulation efficiencies, overcoming the fundamental limitations of the DL graphene configuration and outperforming state-of-the-art graphene and Si technologies. The compatibility of this hBN\u2013HfO2\u2013hBN dielectric with Si and other 2D materials might allow for considerable scaling improvements and greater device functionality in a broad range of graphene- and 2D-based electronic and optoelectronic applications, even beyond graphene-based modulators."

                        "The Si photonic waveguide with a core cross-section of 750\u2009nm\u2009\u00d7\u2009220\u2009nm was prepared on the IMEC iSiPP25G silicon-on-insulator platform20. For the fabrication of the electroabsorption modulator, the graphene and hBN flakes were exfoliated from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and hBN crystals, respectively. The bottom hBN\u2013graphene\u2013hBN stacks were prepared by the van der Waals assembly technique22,23 and transferred directly onto the Si waveguide separated by a 10\u00a0nm spacer of high-quality thermal SiO2. The bottom hBN flake (separating the graphene and the SiO2 layer) thickness of\u2009~5\u2009nm was chosen to enhance the graphene absorption while isolating the graphene from the rough SiO2 substrate. The top hBN has a thickness of ~10\u2009nm. The stack has been etched by reactive ion etching in an oxygen (O2) and trifluoromethane (CHF3) (4:40 sccm) environment to expose the graphene edge. The bottom stack was then contacted by a 3/15/30\u00a0nm Cr/Pd/Au metal combination. The 10\u00a0nm hafnium oxide film has been deposited at 250\u2009\u00b0C prior depositions of a 2\u00a0nm sputtered SiO2 seed layer by ALD. Tetrakis-dimethylamido hafnium (TDMAH) (0.4\u00a0s purge time) and water vapor (5\u00a0s purge time) as precursors have been used in a Savannah G1 system from Cambridge Nanotech. The top hBN\u2013graphene\u2013hBN stack with a 7\u00a0nm- and 21\u00a0nm-thick bottom and top hBN layers has followed the same fabrication steps as the bottom stack."
