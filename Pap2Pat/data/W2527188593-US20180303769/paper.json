    "abstract": "Diverse pathogenic agents often utilize overlapping host networks, and hub proteins within these networks represent attractive targets for broad-spectrum drugs. Using bacterial toxins, we describe a new approach for discovering broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting host proteins that mediate multiple pathogenic pathways. This approach can be widely used, as it combines genetic-based target identification with cell survival-based and protein function-based multiplex drug screens, and concurrently discovers therapeutic compounds and their protein targets. Using B-lymphoblastoid cells derived from the HapMap Project cohort of persons of African, European, and Asian ancestry we identified host caspases as hub proteins that mediate the lethality of multiple pathogenic agents. We discovered that an approved drug, Bithionol, inhibits host caspases and also reduces the detrimental effects of anthrax lethal toxin, diphtheria toxin, cholera toxin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, Botulinum neurotoxin, ricin, and Zika virus. Our study reveals the practicality of identifying host proteins that mediate multiple disease pathways and discovering broad-spectrum therapies that target these hub proteins.",

                        "Cytotoxic bacterial and plant toxins have evolved to exploit host proteins and cellular pathways that mediate the entry of those toxins into host cells and to induce cell-death. Although toxins exploit unique host pathways, these pathways are interconnected. While anthrax, diphtheria, and Botulinum toxins reach the cytoplasm from acidified endosomes, cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ricin toxins are transported into the cytoplasm through the host ER-associated degradation pathway4. These pathways interconnect at host \u201chub\u201d proteins. Using one of those toxins, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE), we set out to identify such hub proteins by i) determining whether known genetic mutations in host proteins exploited by PE affect the sensitivity of host cells to this toxin, and ii) investigating whether these host proteins are also exploited by additional pathogenic agents. The protein hubs will be used as targets in drug screens in order to discover broad-spectrum, host-oriented, anti-pathogenic agent drugs (Fig. 1b)."

                        "It has previously been shown that PE exploits several host proteins for its binding to and entry into host cells5 and initiates programmed cell death by inducing activities of host caspase-3, -6, and -76. We investigated whether known mutations in host proteins exploited by PE associate with altered cytotoxicity of the toxin in cells from tissues that are naturally attacked by this toxin. The availability of human B-cells, which are physiological targets of PE7 through the HapMap Project8 has provided us with an opportunity to test whether mutations in host proteins that constitute the PE pathogenicity pathway affect the cellular sensitivity to this toxin. Our initial tests with cells from a few individuals revealed that their sensitivity to PE varies greatly. Remarkably, our further investigation of PE sensitivity of B-lymphoblastoid cells derived from 234 individuals in geographically and ethnically diverse human populations [87 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 60 Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU), 43 Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT), and 44 Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB)] showed a prominent 200-fold difference in lethality to the toxin (Fig. 2a,b). The range in PE sensitivity, as measured by the dose required to kill 20% of the cells [log(1/LD20)], was similar in all four human cell populations (Fig. 2c). Analysis of toxin sensitivity in parent/children trios indicated that relative sensitivity to PE is a heritable trait (P-value <0.0001) (Fig. 2d).",
                        "The widespread and unimodal distribution observed for log(1/LD20) (Fig. 2b) is likely a result of a polygenic inheritance model, consistent with evidence that multiple host proteins mediate PE lethality56. To learn whether genetic variations in the genes encoding for these proteins account for any of the variation in sensitivity of B-cells to PE seen in Fig. 2a, we tested the association of numerous previously reported mutations with PE sensitivity. Caspase-7 and -3 mutations that were previously reported to associate with cancer and rheumatoid arthritis910111213 demonstrated a significant association with PE sensitivity in the individual HapMap populations (CASP7, rs3814231, CEU, P\u2009=\u20090.01; CASP7, rs2227309, CEU, P\u2009=\u20090.02; CASP3, rs4647601, rs4647693, and rs1049216, East Asian populations CHB and JPT combined, P\u2009=\u20090.04 for each SNP) (Figs 2e and S1). These results show that the activity of caspases affects host cell sensitivity to toxins, and that these proteins are potential therapeutic intervention points and targets for the following drug screens. In addition to PE, ricin and toxins of anthrax, diphtheria, Botulinum, and cholera induce programmed cellular death by activating host caspases614151617181920 (Fig. 3a). Therefore, a drug screen against hub caspases is of great interest, as these proteins are exploited by multiple pathogenic pathways, and caspase inhibitors can act as broad-spectrum drugs."

Caspase activities were induced in RAW264.7 cells by PE treatment. To screen and identify drugs that inhibit proteolytic activities of caspases we utilized a fluorescence-based FRET assay. Optimized substrate peptides for caspase-3, -6, and -3/7 proteolytic activities were used with a fluorogenic 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin group at the N-terminus and acetyl quenching group at the C-terminus. As a FRET substrate that is uniquely cleaved by caspase-7 hasn\u2019t been identified, and since caspases-3 and -7 are close orthologues, we searched for caspase-7 inhibitors that could block proteolysis of a caspase-3/7 \u2013 specific substrate and not caspase-3 \u2013 specific substrate. After cleavage by caspase the fluorescence of AMC at 460\u2009nm increases, while inhibitors of caspases prevent it. Compounds that showed greater than 80% (~1% hit rate) inhibition were defined as hits and selected for re-validation and further studies. Events defined as \u201cmultiplex hits\u201d interfered with proteolytic activities of at least two caspases.

We tested the ability of Bithionol to inhibit activities of ten purified recombinant human caspase proteins, and we demonstrated that in addition to caspases-3, -6, and -7, Bithionol inhibited activities of caspases-1 and -9, while having no inhibitory effects on other caspases (Fig. 4i). Together, these results demonstrate that Bithionol is a direct inhibitor of a select subset of caspases, and that it reduces cellular sensitivity to toxins by targeting at least five host caspases."

After cleavage by BoNT/A the fluorescence of FITC at 523\u2009nm increases. We determined that Bithionol did not affect the proteolysis rate of the fluorescent substrate (Fig. 6c).

Both strains utilized in this study had low passage histories and had intact glycosylation sites. Furthermore, both strains were geographically and genetically divergent. Puerto Rico Zika strain, PRVABC59, is closely related to virus strains circulating in the New World including those strains isolated in Brazil and Guatemala.

Collectively, utilization of both cellular- and biochemical-based multiplex drug screens provided us with i) a drug hit (Bithionol), ii) a drug-target (caspases), and iii) an assessment of breadth of spectra of the drug. This disease-network-based approach utilizing two diverse multiplex drug screenings, which we term \u201cDisparate Dual Multiplexing\u201d, could significantly shorten the time needed for drug-discovery followed by target-identification steps in a historically lengthy process.

                "Bithionol was previously approved to treat helminthes, and although the exact target within these species is not known, it is believed that the drug inhibits oxidative phosphorylation of parasites34. Our study has uncovered five additional Bithionol targets: caspases-1, -3, -6, -7, and -9, which by definition makes Bithionol a polypharmacological drug. Polypharmacological phenomena include a single drug acting on multiple targets of either a unique or multiple disease pathways. Just like in the current study, many of the polypharmacological approaches aim to discover the unknown off targets for existing drugs, and this approach is called \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d335. Therefore, this raises the possibility that Bithionol targets additional non-caspase host proteins exploited by toxins. To our knowledge, no other drugs used in humans have been reported to inhibit caspases. In the future, Bithionol can be investigated for its efficacy to treat other non-infectious human diseases caused by detrimental activities of caspases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory bowel disease.",
                "Bithionol was replaced by the more effective anti-helminthic, Praziquantel34. Moreover, Bithionol was used as a bacteriostatic additive in cosmetic products, but was discontinued in 1967 due to photosensitizing effects27. Presently, Bithionol is still used to treat helminthic cases in some Asian and European countries and is included as an active ingredient in Fonergine\u00ae, used to treat mouth and throat disorders in Argentina36. The current drug discovery and development process can take many years for the successful introduction of a new drug into the market. Thus, the current de novo drug discovery and development paradigm is ineffective for dealing with rapidly emerging biological threat agents. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing may offer numerous advantages. Since Bithionol already has a well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in patients and animals, as well as bulk manufacturing methods27, the drug could rapidly be made available for a new indication if a biological emergency was to occur. Most notably, it has been shown that after oral administration of 50\u2009mg/kg of Bithionol in humans, the drug reaches serum concentrations that range from 225 to 480\u2009\u03bcM27, which is on average 30 times higher than the EC50 achieved by our cellular tests (Figs 4, 5, and 6). This suggests that it is possible to achieve effective anti-toxin and anti-Zika Bithionol doses in blood by oral administration. In addition, Bithionol was i) used to treat cerebral paragonimiasis37 and is known to cross the brain-blood barrier38; ii) reported to cross the placental barrier39; and iii) was used to treat paragonimiasis in a population that included children and pregnant women40. All of these observations suggest that Bithionol is likely to achieve anti-Zika efficacy in humans."

Cell viability is shown as the percentage of survivors obtained relative to cells in the absence of the toxin (100% survival). LD20 was calculated for each cell line. Statistical analysis and graphical presentation were performed using GraphPad Prism software. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Homozygous medians were compared by an unpaired t test. CHB and JPT, two East Asian populations, were pooled in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of effect size in the larger combined population. Because linear regression is sensitive to outliers, we removed one outlier in CHB, as the log sensitivity of this cell line couldn\u2019t be determined within the toxin range tested."
