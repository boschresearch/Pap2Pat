                        "In recent years, a better understanding of protein interaction networks has led to the identification of highly connected hub proteins and pathways that are commonly used by a number of different pathogens and in a range of diseases. These hubs represent promising targets for drug development as depicted in FIG. 1A.",
                        "Most disease networks have the \u201csmall-world\u201d property, where proteins are only a few interactions away from any other proteins. Therefore, inhibiting a given node can potentially affect the state of most nodes in its vicinity as well as the activity of the network itself. In this way, therapeutic inhibition of nodes and hubs within one disease network can affect other disease modules or pathways.",
                        "Cytotoxic bacterial and plant toxins have evolved to exploit host proteins and cellular pathways that mediate the entry of those toxins into host cells and to induce cell-death. Although toxins exploit unique host pathways, these pathways are interconnected. For example, while anthrax, diphtheria, and Botulinum toxins reach the cytoplasm from acidified endosomes, cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ricin toxins are transported into the cytoplasm through the host ER-associated degradation pathway. These pathways interconnect at host \u201chub\u201d proteins. It is known that multiple infectious pathogens or toxins that negatively affect hosts by different mechanisms exploit the same host pathways. Accordingly, it is feasible for multiplex approaches to lead to the discovery of a therapy for broadly active and host-oriented infectious diseases that target the host function being exploited by multiple pathogenic agents."

Although toxins exploit unique host pathways, these pathways are interconnected. While anthrax, diphtheria, and Botulinum toxins reach the cytoplasm from acidified endosomes, cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ricin toxins are transported into the cytoplasm through the host ER-associated degradation pathway. These pathways interconnect at host \u201chub\u201d proteins. Using one of those toxins, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE), such hub proteins were identified by i) determining whether known genetic mutations in host proteins exploited by PE affect the sensitivity of host cells to this toxin, and ii) investigating whether these host proteins are also exploited by additional pathogenic agents. The protein hubs will be used as targets in drug screens, in order to discover broad-spectrum host-oriented anti-pathogenic agents drugs (FIG. 1B)."

                                "It has previously been shown that PE exploits several host proteins for its binding to and entry into host cells 5 and initiates programmed cell death by inducing activities of host caspase-3, -6, and -7. It was investigated whether known mutations in host proteins exploited by PE associate with altered cytotoxicity of the toxin in cells from tissues that are naturally attacked by this toxin. The availability of human B-cells, which are physiological targets of PE through the HapMap Project (Sabeti et al., 2005, Nature, 437:1299-1320, doi:10.1038/nature04226, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference) provided an opportunity to test whether mutations in host proteins that constitute PE pathogenicity pathway affect the cellular sensitivity to this toxin. The initial tests with cells from a few individuals revealed that their sensitivity to PE varies greatly. Remarkably, further investigation of PE sensitivity of B-lymphoblastoid cells derived from 234 individuals in geographically and ethnically diverse human populations [87 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 60 Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU), 43 Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT), and 44 Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB)] showed a prominent 200-fold difference in lethality to the toxin (FIGS. 3A and 3B). The range in PE sensitivity, as measured by the dose required to kill 20% of the cells [log(1/LD20)], was similar in all four human cell populations (FIG. 3C). Analysis of toxin sensitivity in parent/children trios indicated that relative sensitivity to PE is a heritable trait (P-value<0.0001) (FIG. 3D).",
                                "The widespread and unimodal distribution observed for log(1/LD20) (FIG. 3B) is likely a result of a polygenic inheritance model, consistent with evidence that multiple host proteins mediate PE lethality. To learn whether genetic variations in the genes encoding for these proteins account for any of the variation in sensitivity of B-cells to PE seen in FIG. 3A, the association of numerous previously reported mutations with PE sensitivity was tested. Caspase-7 and -3 mutations that were previously reported to associate with cancer and rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated a significant association with PE sensitivity in the individual HapMap populations (CASP7, rs3814231, CEU, P=0.01; CASP7, rs2227309, CEU, P=0.02; CASP3, rs4647601, rs4647693, and rs1049216, East Asian populations CHB and JPT combined, P=0.04 for each SNP) (FIGS. 3E-3I). These results show that the activity of caspases affects host cell sensitivity to toxins, and that these proteins are potential therapeutic intervention points and targets for the following drug screens. In addition to PE, ricin and toxins of anthrax, diphtheria, Botulinum, and cholera induce programmed cellular death by activating host caspases (FIG. 2A). Therefore, a drug screen against hub caspases is of great interest, as these proteins are exploited by multiple pathogenic pathways, and therefore caspase inhibitors can act as broad-spectrum drugs."

Caspase activities were induced in RAW264.7 cells by PE treatment. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was used to screen and identify drugs that inhibit proteolytic activities of caspases. Optimized substrate peptides for caspase-3, -6, and -3/7 proteolytic activities were used with a fluorogenic 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin group at the N-terminus and acetyl quenching group at the C-terminus. As a FRET substrate that is uniquely cleaved by caspase-7 has not been identified, and since caspases-3 and -7 are close orthologues, caspase-7 inhibitors were searched for one that could block proteolysis of a caspase-3/7-specific substrate and not caspase-3-specific substrate. After cleavage by caspase, the fluorescence of AMC at 460 nm increases, while inhibitors of caspases prevent it. Compounds that showed greater than 80% (\u02dc1% hit rate) inhibition were defined as hits and selected for re-validation and further studies. Events defined as \u201cmultiplex hits\u201d interfered with proteolytic activities of at least two caspases.

                                "After oral administration, Bithionol crosses the intestinal epithelium and is absorbed into the bloodstream in humans and many animals. The efficacy of Bithionol as a therapeutic agent during BoNT/A intoxication in Swiss Webster mice was tested. Animals were given a lethal oral dose of BoNT/A complex in the presence and absence of Bithionol. Ninety percent of animals that received a lethal dose of BoNT/A without Bithionol died within 3 days of intoxication (FIG. 6B). All mice that were challenged with BoNT/A and treated with Bithionol at 6.0 mg/kg, survived without displaying toxin-associated symptoms, such as wasp waist and paralysis (FIG. 6B).",
                                "Since BoNT/A acts as a protease, it was investigated whether Bithionol directly inhibits the proteolytic activity of BoNT/A by utilizing a FRET assay. An optimized SNAP-25 peptide with a fluorogenic FITC group at the N-terminus and DABCYL quenching group at the C-terminus was used as the substrate. After cleavage by BoNT/A the fluorescence of FITC at 523 nm increases. It was determined that Bithionol did not affect the proteolysis rate of the fluorescent substrate (FIG. 6C). This result shows that Bithionol protects mice by inhibiting host targets, rather than by inhibiting the toxin itself."

The strains utilized in this study were chosen to gauge the ability of Bithionol to inhibit Zika virus strains found within both ZIKV lineages. Both strains utilized in this study had low passage histories and had intact glycosylation sites. Furthermore, both strains were geographically and genetically divergent. Puerto Rico Zika strain, PRVABC59, is closely related to virus strains circulating in the New World including those strains isolated in Brazil and Guatemala. The African ZIKV lineage is ancestral to the Asian lineage; as such DAK AR D 41525 was selected as it is a low passage strain that is mycoplasma free. The ability of Bithionol to inhibit Senegal and Puerto Rico isolates of ZIKV in infected Vero E6 cells and human astrocytes was tested. In order to detect infected cells, immuno-staining was performed using anti-Flavi-virus envelope protein antibodies. Bithionol inhibited the abundance of Puerto Rico ZIKV in Vero E6 cells with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 6.7 \u03bcM as well as Senegal ZIKV in Vero E6 and human astrocytes with EC50's of 5.5 and 6.3 \u03bcM respectively (FIG. 6D, 6E).
