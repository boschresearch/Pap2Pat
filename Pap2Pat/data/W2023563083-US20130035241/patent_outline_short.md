# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- introduce pluripotent cells and non-coding RNAs

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe pluripotent cells
- limitations of ES cells
- introduce iPS cells

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- identify key genes and non-coding RNAs
- describe functions of key genes and non-coding RNAs

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- describe research methods and results

### Materials and Methods:

- describe iPS cell line and pluripotent status identification
- describe RNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis

## Results:

- present research findings on pluripotency of mouse ES cells

### iPS Cell Line and Pluripotency Identification

- describe pluripotency identification methods

### High Activity of the Imprinted Region Dlk1-Dlo3 is an Important Characterization of Pluripotency

- analyze microRNA expression in stem cells
- identify imprinted region Dlk1-Dio3 as key to pluripotency
- show expression differences between 2N-iPS and 4N-ES/iPS cells

### Results of Function Verification Experiment:

- verify function of genes and microRNAs in Dlk1-Dio3 region
