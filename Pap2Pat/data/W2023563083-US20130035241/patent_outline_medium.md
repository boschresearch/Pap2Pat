### iPS Cell Line and Pluripotency Identification

- describe pluripotency identification methods

### High Activity of the Imprinted Region Dlk1-Dlo3 is an Important Characterization of Pluripotency

- analyze non-coding microRNA expression in stem cells
- identify differently expressed microRNAs between 2N and 4N cells
- describe imprinted region Dlk1-Dio3 of mouse chromosome 12
- show expression differences of genes and microRNAs in 2N-iPS cells and 4N-ES/iPS cells
- identify highly expressed microRNAs in 4N-ES/iPS cells
- conclude high activity of imprinted region Dlk1-Dio3 is important for pluripotency

### Results of Function Verification Experiment:

- verify expression of genes and microRNAs of Dlk1-Dio3 region in various cell lines
