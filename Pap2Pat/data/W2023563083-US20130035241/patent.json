                        "Pluripotent cells are a type of cells having an ability of multiple differentiation potential to form various tissues and cells of human and animal individuals after cell division and cell differentiation. At present, Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) is the most well known pluripotent cell. The ES cell is a special cell line obtained by culturing in vitro cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts in an early stage of embryo development of mammals, under certain conditions. This type of cells has an ability of keeping undifferentiated state and infinite proliferation. Nowadays, the ES cells have been successfully induced to differentiate into nearly all types of cells, including nerve cells, hepatic cells, endothelial cells, cardiac muscle cells, pancreatic beta cells and hematopoietic cells. The development of stem cells and regenerative medicine plays an important promoting role in the field of development biology, tissue-organ transplantation, gene therapy, cell therapy and drug development, and will be expected to resolve the medical problems confronted by human beings, such as cardiac-cerebral vascular disease, diabetes and neurological disease; thus, the new breakthrough and development of bioscience and biotechnology caused thereby would bring revolutionary changes to the population health and the medical field and become the high-tech industry with the great potential in 21st century.",
                        "The conventional ES cell encounters two bottlenecks not easily to be conquered in the application of regenerative medicine; first, the method of acquiring the ES cells needs to adopt an early embryo, which involves the ethical problem; second, when the ES cells acquired are used for a clinical patient, immunological rejection problems would occur. In order to overcome the problem of immunological rejection, the first problem people meet is how to reprogram somatic cells of a patient into pluripotent cells through various methods and then to differentiate into cells of needed types for cell therapy and organ transplantation. The appearance of a cloned sheep named Dolly in 1997 proved that ovocyte has the ability of reprogramming a differentiated mammalian adult cell into the state of embryonic full pluripotency and this cell can generate pluripotent stem cells and develop into a new individual. However, the lack of oocytes and the ethical problems involved in the use of embryos limit the development of this technology in the field of regenerative medicine. In 2006, Yamanaka first proved that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, that is, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) (Takahashi et al., 2007; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007), by means of the forced expression of four exogenous transcription factors. This discovery makes the research of somatic cell reprogramming down to the level of genes, and meanwhile broadened the direction of the reprogramming research. From the technical perspective, the iPS cells are derived from somatic cells but not an embryo, which avoids the ethical controversy confronted by human ES cells, therefore with bright application future.",
                        "Over the years, the identification of the pluripotent status of ES cells depends on animal chimeric experiments; however, human chimeric experiments can not be implemented due to legal restrictions and ethical problems; therefore, the identification of the pluripotent status of human ES cells lacks a powerful standard. People are always trying to seek for proper markers to distinguish the developmental potentiality of stem cells; however, no success is achieved so far.",
                        "Totally reprogrammed iPS cells have true pluripotency, can differentiate into every type of somatic cells and can give birth to mouse with normal reproductive capacity through the method of tetraploid embryo complementation (Zhao et al., 2009). However, the screening of totally reprogrammed iPS cells through the method of tetraploid embryo complementation has a high technical requirement and the success rate is very low, which seriously delays the development and application of the iPS technology. Due to the restriction of ethics, the pluripotency of human iPS cells can not be validated through the method of tetraploid embryo complementation; thus, iPS cells meet a significant barrier when finally being applied to clinic; therefore, a new iPS cell classification standard is needed to screen the iPS cells with true pluripotency.",
                        "Aiming at the above problems, the invention first adopted the conventional pluripotency validation method of stem cells to divide different iPS cells into two types, from one type (hereinafter called 4N iPS cells) animals can be obtained through the method of tetraploid embryo complementation, and from the other type (hereinafter called 2N iPS cells) animals can be obtained only through the method of diploid chimera. Then the invention compared the expression difference of genes and non-coding RNAs between these two types of iPS cells through a gene chip and microRNA sequencing, and discovered a group of genes, microRNA clusters and other non-coding RNAs that are highly expressed in the 4N iPS cell but are not expressed or lowly expressed in the 2N iPS cell. This group of genes, microRNA clusters and other non-coding RNAs are located in an imprinted region (or imprinted domain) of mouse chromosome 12, including five coding genes, three non-coding genes, a C/D box snoRNA gene cluster, a microRNA cluster containing a plurality of very conservative microRNAs, and some other non-coding RNAs. And the invention proved that this region not only reflects the pluripotent state of cells, but also determines the developmental potentiality of cells. This result has been validated in many cell lines from different sources. The chip/microarray or other methods designed for the non-coding microRNA of this region can serve as a standard of characterizing the developmental potentiality of pluripotent cells. Compared with the conventional method of tetraploid complementation, the technique of this invention has a lower technical requirement, a shorter operation period and does not involve an ethic factor, and has a broad application prospect in the field of iPS cells.",
                        "Since these genes and non-coding microRNAs are very conservative in mammals, we speculate the cluster of genes, microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs probably has the same important functions in human ES cells and other mammals. This achievement first proposes an effective molecular marker for identifying the pluripotent status of cells, and may adjust the pluripotent state and level of cells by regulating this cluster of genes, obtain a new breakthrough in the research of pathogenesis of diseases such as tumour, discover potential drug targets for tumour treatment and develop new antitumor drugs. In addition, this invention has not screened out other gene or non-coding RNA clusters which can definitely distinguish the pluripotent state of cells, on other locations of the mouse genome; thus, the coding genes, microRNA clusters and other non-coding RNAs in this imprinted region probably are the unique key identifier for determining the pluripotent state of cells."

These genes, microRNA clusters and other non-coding RNAs are located on the chromosome 12 of mouse genome and are a very conservative microRNA gathering region; ES or iPS cells in which the genes and non-coding RNAs of this region are highly expressed show full differentiation potential, while the expression of this region is significantly suppressed or silenced in cells with partial differentiation pluripotency; this region not only reflects the pluripotent state of ES or iPS cells, but also determines the developmental potentiality of ES or iPS cells. Since the coding microRNAs of this region only exist in the genomes of mammals and are very conservative, the cluster of microRNAs probably has the same important function in mammals including human ES cells. This achievement for the first time proposes an effective molecular marker for identifying the pluripotent status of cells, the pluripotent state and level of cells may be adjusted by regulating this cluster of genes. The inventors find that the key genes, microRNAs, other non-coding RNAs and any combination thereof for identifying and regulating the pluripotent status of cells are highly expressed in full pluripotent stem cells but are significantly suppressed or silenced in partially pluripotent stem cells.",

                        "The microRNA cluster in the invention is highly conserved in mammals. In both humans and mice, the abnormal expression of imprinted genes of this region would cause the abnormal development of some embryos and placentas. This demonstrates that the functions of this cluster of microRNAs are conservative in mammals. Therefore, the inventors predict that this cluster of microRNAs has the same important functions in the human ES cells.",
                        "So far, the limited pluripotency and weak differentiation ability of human induced Pluripotent Stem (hiPS) cells is a serious problem (Hu et al.); besides, the pluripotency of human ES cells still can not be examined, and there lacks an effective means for distinguishing the ES cells and the iPS cells with different developmental potentialities. Since the expression of microRNA clusters of this region has an important influence on the development of embryo, the pluripotent status of human ES cells can be distinguished by detecting the expression of the microRNAs of this region, therefore to select the pluripotent cell with the high expression of microRNAs of this region, that is, with high pluripotent status and highest developmental potentiality level, for applications such as cell treatment. In addition, since the microRNA cluster of this region is highly conservative in mammals, the identification of pluripotent cells of other big animals also can be implemented by detecting the expression of these microRNAs, then, the validation work of pluripotent cells can be greatly simplified.",

The PRC2 can trigger trimethylation of Lysine at position 27 of histone H3, thereby causing gene silencing. Before the PRC2 triggers methylation, it is needed to activate Histone Deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to remove the acetylation modification of histone H3. Our research result indicates that, in ES and 4n iPS cells, the expression of encoded microRNAs of the Dlk1-Dio3 region suppresses the expression of HDAC2, RBAP48 and EED, thereby resulting in the reduction of formation of PRC2 and demethylation of genome. In ES and iPS cells, the reduction of formation of PRC2 would cause demethylation of the Dlk1-Dio3 region, which coincides with our research result that the expression of genes and microRNAs is increased. (See FIG. 5)The expression of microRNAs further suppresses the formation of PRC2 by targeting the transcription of hdac2, rbap48 and eed, and finally a positive feedback regulation signalling pathway is formed.",

In fully pluripotent stem cells, microRNAs of the Dlk1-Dio3 region are in an activation state. Therefore, the mRNA used for guiding the synthesis of the three proteins of HDAC2, RBAP48 and EED can not function normally; cells can not form the PRC2 complex, thereby causing the demethylation of the Dlk1-Dio3 region and further facilitating the expression of microRNAs of the Dlk1-Dio3 region to form a positive feedback regulation pathway."

The uses according to claim 1, wherein the expression level of the microRNA cluster is positively correlated to the pluripotent level of the ES cells and iPS cells, that is, the expression level in the ES cells and iPS cells which can form germ-line chimera is obviously higher than that in the ES cells and iPS cells which can not form germ-line chimera.",
        "3. The uses according to claim 1, wherein the microRNA includes all microRNAs listed in SEQ ID 1-72.",
        "4. Uses of the microRNA cluster or any microRNA therein or microRNA combination thereof and homologous genes of any microRNA above with 70-100% se uence homolo in genomic syntenic regions of other mammals or combination thereof according to claim 1 in isolating, proliferating and typing ES cells and iPS cells and their uses in the treatment of diseases relating to the ES cells and iPS cells.",
        "5. Uses of Rtl1, Meg3, Rian, 1110006E14Rik, B830012L14Rik and Mirg genes in a chromosome imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region located on the long arm of mouse chromosome 12 or a combination thereof and homologous genes of the genes above with 70-100% sequence homology in genomic syntenic regions of other mammals or a combination thereof in identifying or regulating pluripotent levels of ES cells and iPS cells, wherein the genes are highly expressed in full pluripotent ES cells and iPS cells but are significantly suppressed or silenced in partially pluripotent ES cells and iPS cells.",
        "6. The uses according to claim 5, wherein the expression level of the genes is positively correlated to the pluripotent level of the ES cells and iPS cells, that is, the expression level in the ES cells and iPS cells which can form germ-line chimera is obviously higher than that in the ES cells and iPS cells which can not form germ-line chimera.",
        "7. Uses of the genes or combination thereof and homologous genes of said genes in other species or combination thereof according to claim 5 in isolating, proliferating and typing ES cells and iPS cells and their uses in the treatment of diseases relating to the ES cells and iPS cells.",
        "8. The uses according to claim 2, wherein the microRNA includes all microRNAs listed in SEQ ID 1-72.",
        "9. Uses of the microRNA cluster or any microRNA therein or microRNA combination thereof and homologous genes of any microRNA above with 70-100% sequence homology in genomic syntenic regions of other mammals or combination thereof according to claim 2 in isolating, proliferating and typing ES cells and iPS cells and their uses in the treatment of diseases relating to the ES cells and iPS cells.",
        "10. Uses of the microRNA cluster or any microRNA therein or microRNA combination thereof and homologous genes of any microRNA above with 70-100% sequence homology in genomic syntenic regions of other mammals or combination thereof according to claim 3 in isolating, proliferating and typing ES cells and iPS cells and their uses in the treatment of diseases relating to the ES cells and iPS cells.",
