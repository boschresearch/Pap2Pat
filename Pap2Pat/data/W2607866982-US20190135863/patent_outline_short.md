# DESCRIPTION

- introduce retro-inverso peptides for cancer treatment

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe limitations of current cancer therapies
- explain role of uPAR and FPR1 in cell migration and cancer
- discuss prior art peptides and their limitations

## DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- introduce retro-inverso peptides as potent inhibitors of cell migration and angiogenesis
- describe general formula and preferred compounds of the invention

## EXAMPLE 1. SYNTHESIS OF THE RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES RI-1, RI-2, RI-3, RI-4, RI-5

- describe synthesis of retro-inverso peptides

## EXAMPLE 2. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES DO NOT PROMOTE CELL MIGRATION

- show that retro-inverso peptides do not elicit cell migration

## EXAMPLE 3. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INTERFERES WITH FPR1 BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY BY BLOCKING AGONIST/FPR1 INTERACTION AND BY PREVENTING AGONIST-INDUCED FPR1 INTERNALIZATION

- demonstrate that RI-3 competes with fMLF for binding to FPR1 and inhibits FPR1 internalization

## EXAMPLE 4. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL MIGRATION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

- show that retro-inverso peptides inhibit cell migration in a dose-dependent manner

## EXAMPLE 5. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL INVASION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

- demonstrate that retro-inverso peptides inhibit cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner

## EXAMPLE 6. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 DOES NOT AFFECT CELL PROLIFERATION

- show that RI-3 does not affect cell proliferation

## EXAMPLE 7. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 IS STABLE IN HUMAN SERUM

- investigate stability of RI-3 in human serum

### EXAMPLE 8. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS MATRIGEL INVASION BY HUMAN SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS

- investigate ability of RI-3 to prevent matrigel invasion

### EXAMPLE 9. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS IN VITRO TRANS-ENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION BY SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS AS WELL AS BY HUMAN MONOCYTES

- investigate ability of RI-3 to prevent trans-endothelial migration

### EXAMPLE 10. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INHIBITS BOTH FBS AND VEGF-TRIGGERED ENDOTHELIAL TUBE FORMATION

- investigate ability of RI-3 to inhibit endothelial tube formation

### EXAMPLE 11. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 EXERTS ANTI-METASTATIC EFFECT REDUCING IN VIVO TUMOR GROWTH AND VASCULAR INFILTRATION BY SARCOMA CELLS

- investigate anti-metastatic effect of RI-3 in vivo
