## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

## DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

## EXAMPLE 1. SYNTHESIS OF THE RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES RI-1, RI-2, RI-3, RI-4, RI-5

## EXAMPLE 2. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES DO NOT PROMOTE CELL MIGRATION

## EXAMPLE 3. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INTERFERES WITH FPR1 BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY BY BLOCKING AGONIST/FPR1 INTERACTION AND BY PREVENTING AGONIST-INDUCED FPR1 INTERNALIZATION

## EXAMPLE 4. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL MIGRATION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

## EXAMPLE 5. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL INVASION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

## EXAMPLE 6. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 DOES NOT AFFECT CELL PROLIFERATION

## EXAMPLE 7. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 IS STABLE IN HUMAN SERUM

### EXAMPLE 8. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS MATRIGEL INVASION BY HUMAN SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS

### EXAMPLE 9. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS IN VITRO TRANS-ENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION BY SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS AS WELL AS BY HUMAN MONOCYTES

### EXAMPLE 10. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INHIBITS BOTH FBS AND VEGF-TRIGGERED ENDOTHELIAL TUBE FORMATION

### EXAMPLE 11. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 EXERTS ANTI-METASTATIC EFFECT REDUCING IN VIVO TUMOR GROWTH AND VASCULAR INFILTRATION BY SARCOMA CELLS
