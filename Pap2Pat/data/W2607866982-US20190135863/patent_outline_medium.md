# DESCRIPTION

- introduce retro-inverso peptides for cancer treatment

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe cancer metastasis and its consequences
- explain cell migration and its role in cancer
- introduce urokinase receptor (uPAR) and its role in cell migration
- describe Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs) and their role in cell migration
- discuss prior art peptides that inhibit uPAR-FPR interaction
- highlight limitations of prior art peptides
- emphasize need for new peptides that prevent uPAR-FPR interaction

## DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- introduce retro-inverso (RI) peptides as potent inhibitors of cell migration
- describe general formula of RI peptides
- list preferred compounds of the invention
- describe methods for preparing RI peptides
- outline potential uses of RI peptides in cancer treatment

## EXAMPLE 1. SYNTHESIS OF THE RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES RI-1, RI-2, RI-3, RI-4, RI-5

- describe solid-phase synthesis of RI peptides
- outline purification and characterization of RI peptides

## EXAMPLE 2. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES DO NOT PROMOTE CELL MIGRATION

- show that RI peptides do not elicit cell migration

## EXAMPLE 3. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INTERFERES WITH FPR1 BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY BY BLOCKING AGONIST/FPR1 INTERACTION AND BY PREVENTING AGONIST-INDUCED FPR1 INTERNALIZATION

- demonstrate that RI-3 inhibits FPR1 activation and internalization

## EXAMPLE 4. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL MIGRATION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

- show that RI peptides inhibit cell migration in a dose-dependent manner

## EXAMPLE 5. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDES INHIBIT CELL INVASION IN A DOSE DEPENDENT MANNER

- demonstrate that RI peptides inhibit cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner

## EXAMPLE 6. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 DOES NOT AFFECT CELL PROLIFERATION

- show that RI-3 does not affect cell proliferation

## EXAMPLE 7. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 IS STABLE IN HUMAN SERUM

- investigate stability of RI-3 in human serum

### EXAMPLE 8. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS MATRIGEL INVASION BY HUMAN SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS

- investigate ability of RI-3 to prevent matrigel invasion

### EXAMPLE 9. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 PREVENTS IN VITRO TRANS-ENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION BY SARCOMA, MELANOMA AND EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELLS AS WELL AS BY HUMAN MONOCYTES

- investigate ability of RI-3 to prevent trans-endothelial migration

### EXAMPLE 10. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 INHIBITS BOTH FBS AND VEGF-TRIGGERED ENDOTHELIAL TUBE FORMATION

- investigate ability of RI-3 to inhibit endothelial tube formation

### EXAMPLE 11. RETRO-INVERSO PEPTIDE RI-3 EXERTS ANTI-METASTATIC EFFECT REDUCING IN VIVO TUMOR GROWTH AND VASCULAR INFILTRATION BY SARCOMA CELLS

- investigate anti-metastatic effect of RI-3 on tumor growth
- investigate anti-metastatic effect of RI-3 on vascular infiltration
