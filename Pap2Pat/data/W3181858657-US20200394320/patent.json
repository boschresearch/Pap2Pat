                        "The ability of machine learning prediction techniques to accurately fit complex functions has led to widespread adoption by data scientists. Neural networks (NN), in particular, have impacted various fields of application (e.g., image segmentation and classification, text analysis) because currently available computational resources allow for rapid training of such models. Typically, a neural network for discrimination among discrete classes is represented by a function \u0192: N\u2192{0, . . . , k}, mapping from a multidimensional feature space to a finite set of labels (i.e., classes). As the true mapping function \u0192* is not known, \u0192 must be derived by approximating the true mapping based on training data where features and corresponding classes are known. To improve the mapping \u0192 predefined coefficients (weights) \u03b8 in the calculation of \u0192 can be altered in order to minimize the difference between \u0192* and \u0192. To find the optimal choice for \u03b8, numerical optimization, techniques (optimizers) can iteratively loop over the training data and update the values of \u03b8 accordingly. The steps of preparing the training data, designing \u0192 learning \u03b8, evaluating and deploying \u0192 are orchestrated in various data science processes.",
                        "Yet, privacy concerns are emerging since NNs tend to leak information about the underlying training dataset which can be exploited by an adversary. Leveraging this information to identify individuals in the training data is known as membership inference (MI). Training anonymized neural networks with Differential Privacy (DP) as provided herein can mitigate MI. However, selecting among available DP mechanisms and interpreting the privacy guarantee (\u03f5, \u03b4) is challenging as DP can be enforced at multiple points in the data science process by different DP mechanisms. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between utility for the analyst and privacy for the data owner is difficult due to the inherent complexity of the DP guarantee.",

After training  exposes the target model. Second,  trains copies of the target model, shadow models, on data statistically similar to targettrain. If  has white-box access to the target model, i.e., knows hyper-parameters and structure, the shadow models mimic the target model. Alternatively, in black-box access,  invokes shadow models by calling the same training routine as the DO (e.g., by using a Machine-Learning-as-a-Service provider, etc.) and is limited to model input and output. It applies that shadowtrain|=|shadowtest|\u039bshadowtrain\u2229shadowtrain=\u00f8\u039b|shadow\u2229shadow|\u22650 for any i\u2260j.

Second,  can either enforce anonymization with LDP after data preparation (125) or anonymization during model training with DP-SGD (135). Either approach is then automatically evaluated with regard to MI precision for a vector of DP privacy guarantees (\u03f5, \u03b4). Meaning, that multiple instances of the process operations 120-140 can exist (per LDP and DP-SGD (\u03f5, \u03b4) parameter). Finally, after the DP enforcements, a new operation 140 can be provided that captures the input from the process instances 120-140 for interpreting privacy and utility of trained models before actual evaluation and deployment to production. This privacy vs. utility operation 140 can be used to identify which privacy parameters (\u2209, \u03b4) efficiently address MI precision while maintaining high model accuracy. If the privacy parameters necessary for reaching the desired MI precision are inefficient, then the process can return to the privacy negotiation operation 110.",

Randomized response thus serves as a local randomizer  (cf. Definition 4) and we denote the series of repeated executions  (d\u2209train) as  (train). The target model is trained with a standard optimizer (e.g., SGD) on  (targettrain)\u2282 (train). Perturbation using LDP affects  since the direct application of the MI attack against a model trained on the perturbed dataset  (targettrain) should solely provide A with information about the underlying LDP data due to the post-processing proposition (cf. Proposition 1). The privacy in our experiment is evaluated by 's MI precision on (i)  (targettrain), and (ii) original targettrain.",
                        "Again, the first evaluation aspect is 's test accuracy. A main difference to address for this analysis is, that in contrast to the DP-SGD parameters (\u03f5, \u03b4) for LDP, \u03f5i resulting from the execution of randomized response as  per attribute can be considered. The privacy after repeated executions of  is measured by a local algorithm LA (cf. Definition 5), yielding \u03f5=\u03a3i=1600\u03f5i per d\u2209(targettrain). Evaluation can be provided for diverse \u03f5i \u2209{8, 5, 3, 1, 0.1}. These \u03f5i cover a wide range of retention probabilities p, i.e., the probability of retaining the true value (cf. Equation 1), from low \u03c1\u03f5=0.1\u03b80.31 to high \u03c1\u03f5\u03b80.98. FIG. 300B of FIG. 3 indicates that especially simple classification tasks (e.g., C\u2209{10, 20}), where n is much larger than the dimensionality l of the training data, 's test accuracy seems relatively robust to noise.",
                        "Again, for privacy, the protection of 's training data is evaluated by 's MI attack precision.",
                        "For MI against (targettrain) diagram 400B of FIG. 4 demonstrates that the drop in MI precision is larger than the drop in target model accuracy (cf. diagram 300B of FIG. 3) caused by LDP. The reasons for this drop are located in the lower target model softmax confidences for classifications when LDP is applied. This decrease in confidence leads to fewer predictions overcoming the threshold exploited by , and thus, MI precision drops. For the more complex classification task C=50, a drop in MI precision as the train-test-gap closes is observed. It can be assumed that Dtrain becomes similar to Dtest due to LDP and the attacker categorizes more data entries as \u201cin\u201d. However, the evaluation before only indicates 's MI risk with regard to  (targettrain).",
                        "A more accurate expression of risk should address records of the original targettrain. When providing original records d\u2209targettrain to 's trained attack model as test records, instead of LDP training data, the intuition is that A should not be able to achieve meaningful precision on this data due to the protection of LDP. Indeed this clearly holds for C\u2209{10, 20} in diagram 400B of FIG. 4. Thus, the actual effect of LDP on MI is even stronger.",
                        "When comparing to DP-SGD, a striking difference is that the reason for the decrease of 's MI precision in LDP is due to the noisy (Dtargettrain), rather than the noisy gradients. Thus, the training dataset itself already enjoys DP protection and the records detected under MI do not represent original data anymore. The evaluation within this section has shown that LDP affects 's MI precision, and that the protection for original data can be even higher. The difference between LDP and DP-SGD privacy guarantees \u03f5 and (\u03f5, \u03b4) also suggests that the privacy guarantee should not be directly compared and a discussion is required.",
                        "The difference in utility and privacy between LDP and DP-SGD is also observable with regard to \u03c6, where 's test accuracy is weakened more than 's MI precision when \u03c6<1 for a given (\u03f5, \u03b4). FIG. 500A illustrates that for DP-SGD our experiments did not yield \u03c6>1 for any (\u03f5, \u03b4). This supports our first impression that DP-SGD impacts 's test accuracy stronger than the MI precision. In contrast, chart 500B of FIG. 5 presents that when LDP is utilized for some \u03f5 there is \u03c6>1. Counterintuitively, higher \u03c6 values are observed for small \u2209 for C\u2209{10, 20} due to an increased test accuracy. Here, LDP achieves a regularization effect. In contrast, increased target model test accuracies for DP-SGD on the same data were not observed. Finally, diagram 500C of FIG. 5 points out that for C\u2209{10, 20} and \u03f5=0.1 LDP can lead to even stronger protections for targettrain. MI precision close to \u03c6 leading to large (o values is observed. However, to achieve this LDP has to be calibrated carefully. The difference in values for \u03c6 in diagram 500B of FIG. 5 is mostly due to a different baseline line MI precision. Instead of performing random guessing, leading to a baseline MI precision of 0.5, 's attack model will label records \u201cin\u201d only when they are similar to the LDP data that has been used for training of the attack model. In the extreme case where LDP records are very different to the original records MI precision close to 0 was observed.",
                        "Furthermore, diagram 500 of FIG. 5 illustrates that a sole comparison of privacy parameters (\u03f5, \u03b4) is not sufficient to evaluate potential privacy risks, e.g., due to MI attacks. While utilizing larger privacy guarantees \u2209, LDP is able to achieve better \u03c6, i.e., a better ratio between privacy and model utility. This stresses 's need for key figures like \u03c6 to support the decision making process Differential Privacy protects training data by anonymization and allows quantification of the resulting privacy loss. However, a direct comparison of the DP guarantees (\u03f5, \u03b4) falls short of measuring factual privacy risks under sophisticated attacks like MI. Furthermore, the parameters (\u03f5, \u03b4) do not have the same meaning between different DP mechanisms. Extending the DS process with steps for defining acceptable MI risk, enforcing DP and interpreting the resulting efficiency of various (\u03f5, \u03b4) parameters with \u03c6 eases this constraint and gives data scientists guidance in their decision making.",
                        "As can be appreciated above, the data science process of FIG. 1 covers two machine learning development cases that are relevant for many model providers and data scientists. First, the process of FIG. 1 allows data scientists to design and interpret machine learning models that protect the training data and to communicate risks towards third-parties who are participating in the training data. These trained models can then be deployed to third parties, either as part of an application or as a prediction service, while the trade-off between privacy and utility due to the enforced mechanism is quantified by \u03c6. Second, it enables third parties to train models that are shipped to them and interpret the respective risk that their training data is facing under MI.",
