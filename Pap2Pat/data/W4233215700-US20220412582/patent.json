    "abstract": "In most buildings energy for space heating and cooling can be used to maintain the thermal comfort of the building's human occupants by maintaining the interior air temperature at a set point. If one could maintain the human occupant's thermal comfort while decreasing the heating or increasing the cooling set point, energy savings are possible.

                        "Turning now to the drawings, methods and systems for tuning radiative heat flows between interior surfaces and human occupants are described. Many embodiments implement tunability of interior surfaces for maximal year-round energy efficiency. In many embodiments, the tuning can be accomplished by dynamically tuning the thermal emissivity of interior building surfaces at long-wave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths to maintain thermal comfort. A number of embodiments implement materials that have tunable emissivity in the LWIR spectrum. Some embodiments implement materials with electrochromic properties to tune emissivity over LWIR wavelengths. Examples of tunable emissivity materials include (but are not limited to): conducting polymers, inorganic oxides, and lithium titanate. Examples of conducting polymers with tunable emissivity in the LWIR spectrum include (but are not limited to): poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) tosylate (PEDOT), poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) tosylate (PEDOT:Tos), poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polyaniline. In some embodiments, the doping concentration of conducting polymers can affect emissivity in LWIR wavelengths. Several embodiments show that doped conducting polymer can have a relatively low emissivity in LWIR ranges while undoped conducting polymer may have a relatively high emissivity. Examples of inorganic oxides with tunable emissivity in the LWIR spectrum include (but are not limited to): tungsten trioxide (WO3), hydrogen tungsten bronzes (HxWO3), and vanadium dioxide. Some embodiments implement ion-irradiated vanadium dioxide for tuning emissivity in interior spaces. In many embodiments, emissivity of the tunable materials in LWIR wavelengths can be tuned electrically including (but not limited to) by applying a voltage. Applied voltage may change the doping concentrations of conducting polymer and hence tune the emissivity in accordance with some embodiments. In several embodiments, tunable emissivity materials can be incorporated in mechanical devices. Emissivity in LWIR ranges can be tuned mechanically in accordance with certain embodiments. In a number of embodiments, low emissivity and high emissivity materials can be applied to different sides of mechanical blinds, and different sides can be switched in response to the weather.",
                        "Several embodiments implement that in cold weather conditions, tuning the emissivity of interior surfaces including (but not limited to) walls, floors, windows, and ceilings to a low value can decrease set point temperatures of heating systems. In many embodiments, tunable emissivity materials in LWIR wavelength are transparent over visible wavelengths such that they can be applied to transparent substrates including (but not limited to) windows. In some embodiments, tuning the emissivity of interior surfaces to a relatively low emissivity at about 0.1 can decrease the set point temperature up to about 7\u00b0 C. The decrease of the set point temperature can correspond to energy saving in accordance to various embodiments. In certain embodiments, low emissivity interior surfaces can achieve an energy saving of approximately 67.7% relative to high emissivity materials, which may have an emissivity of about 0.9. Many embodiments exhibit that in warm weather, tuning interior surfaces including (but not limited to) walls, floors, and ceilings to a high emissivity can result in energy savings relative to low emissivity surfaces of cooling systems. In several embodiments, high emissivity interior surfaces can have achieve about 38.5% energy savings relative to low emissivity surfaces.",
                        "Many embodiments reveal energy savings potential by better controlling the flows of heat that surround human occupants in the form of thermal radiation. Several embodiments demonstrate incorporating materials choices and/or structural parameters that enable emissivity tuning in the LWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum.",
                        "With energy consumption for heating and cooling expected to grow dramatically worldwide, improving the efficiency of these systems may be an important part of mitigating climate change. One goal of heating and cooling in buildings with human occupants is to maintain their thermal comfort (See, e.g. Fanger, P. O., Copenhagen: Danish Technical Press., 1970, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Thermal comfort is both a quantitative and qualitative judgment that connects an individual's physiological and emotional perceptions of being in a thermally comfortable state (See, e.g. Fanger, P. O., Copenhagen: Danish Technical Press., 1970; and Hansen, J., Build Env., 1990, 24, 309-316, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference).",
                        "While thermal comfort can be linked to the air temperature set point in a conditioned space, a human occupant's perception of comfort is subject to a range of other factors. These can include light intensity, material properties, metabolic heat production, heat transfer coefficients and radiative heat losses to external surfaces (See, e.g. Moon, J. H., et al., Int. J. Therm. Sci., 2016, 107, 77-88; and Cheng, Y., et al., Energy Build, 2013, 64, 154-161, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). Human skin temperature is about 33\u00b0 C. in comfortable conditions, while the average heat generation rate of a standing adult is about 70 W/m2 (See, e.g. American Society of Heating, 2013 Ashrae Handbook: Fundamentals, 2013; and Okamoto, T., et al., Sci. Rep., 2017, 7, 11519, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference). Previous work has examined how temperature, air velocity and humidity may affect thermal comfort (See, e.g. Coutts, A. M., et al., Theor. Appl. Climatol., 2016, 124, 55-68; Yang, L., et al., Appl. Energy, 2014, 115, 164-173; and Rupp, R. F., Energy Build., 2015, 105, 178-205, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). Given the complex array of factors that influence the perception of comfort, and the need for reducing energy use for heating and cooling, it is to be noted that an increase in the set point temperature for cooling, or a decrease in the set point for heating, by about 4\u00b0 C. can reduce energy use by up to 45% and 35% respectively (See, e.g. Hoyt, T., et al., In International Conference on Environmental Ergonomics, 2009, 608-612, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).",
                        "In an indoor environment, where most people stay in a sedentary state, more than 50% of the heat generated by the human body is released through thermal radiation in the LWIR part of the spectrum (See, e.g. Cai, L., et al., Nat. Comm., 2017, 8, 496; and Winslow, C.-E., et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1939, 127, 505-518, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). The effect of radiative heat transfer on thermal comfort has been explored (See, e.g. Marino, C., et al., Sol. Energy, 2017, 144, 295-309; and Arslanoglu, N., et al., Energy Build., 2016, 113, 23-29, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference) but remains a comparatively untapped mechanism for efficiency gains. One approach can be tuning the radiative properties of clothing through optical approaches, making the clothing fabric more or less transparent to thermal radiation emitted from the human wearer, depending on weather conditions (See, e.g. Qiu, Q., et al., Nano Energy, 2019, 58, 750-758; Cai, L., et al., Joule, 2019; Zhou, H., et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2019; Yue, X., et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci., 2019, 535, 363-370; Hsu, P. C., et al., Science, 2016, 353, 1019-1023; Guo, Y., et al., ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2016, 8, 4676-4683; Hsu, P.-C., et al., Nano Lett., 2015, 15, 365-371; and Tong, J. K., et al., ACS Photonics, 2015, 2, 769-778, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). While conceptually attractive, this approach poses practical challenges, as it requires the human occupants of a conditioned space to wear specialized clothing depending on weather conditions. On the other hand, materials whose emissivity can be tuned in the LWIR part of the spectrum relevant to room temperature blackbody radiation, including by electrochromic control have been reported (See, e.g. Mulford, R. B., et al., J. Heat Transfer, 2019, 141, 32702; and Zhang, X., et al., Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells, 2019, 200, 109916, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference).",
                        "Many embodiments implement methods to make the environment surrounding the human occupants responsive to their radiative heat flows, and enable improved heating and cooling efficiency. In cold weather conditions, lower radiative heat loss from human occupants may be desirable, as the air temperature could then be maintained at a lower temperature for the same level of thermal comfort. In these conditions it would be preferable to have low emissivity (high reflectivity) materials in the interior surfaces including (but not limited to) floor, ceiling, windows and walls, surrounding an occupant. Low emissivity materials may have emissivity between about 0.1 to about 0.5 in LWIR wavelength in accordance with some embodiments. By contrast, in summer or warm weather conditions, the heat generated by a human should be dissipated to interior surfaces, as these surfaces are typically colder than skin temperature. Thus, high emissivity (and low reflectivity) materials of the surroundings would be desirable. High emissivity materials may have emissivity between about 0.5 to about 1 in LWIR wavelength in accordance with some embodiments. In winter, having low emissivity interior surfaces could reduce the heat loss of a radiator in a room with no human occupant (See, e.g. Robinson, A. J., et al., Energy Build, 2016, 127, 370-381, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). However, one main purpose of space heating and cooling is to ensure the thermal comfort of the human occupants inside. Previous studies lack the understanding of how much energy use can be reduced by controlling the thermal emissivity of interior surfaces, while maintaining the same thermal comfort level for human occupants of a conditioned space. Many embodiments show that the desired radiative properties can change from low emissivity to high emissivity depending on weather conditions and the heat load, enabling maximal heating and cooling efficiency year-round.",
                        "Many embodiments implement tunable emissivity surfaces for interior spaces in built environment. To evaluate the possible set point change and thus energy savings, several embodiments implement computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of an office environment with a human occupant. In some embodiments, the emissivity of the inner walls can be tuned from that of a near blackbody to a very low value. Several embodiments exhibit that in cold weather conditions a decrease in the set point of up to about 7\u00b0 C. relative to conventional materials if a low emissivity surface is used. Certain embodiments show that a decrease of up to about 10\u00b0 C. in the set point when multiple occupants are in the conditioned space. Conversely, in warm weather conditions, a number of embodiments show that an increase in the set point of up to about 4\u00b0 C. can be achieved when the emissivity of the interior surfaces increases to a high value.",
                        "Many embodiments analyze the building scale to evaluate the impact of heating and cooling energy use on a typical summer and winter day in a temperate climate. Building scale analysis can be done using EnergyPlus\u2122 (See, e.g. Kant, K., et al., Sustain. Through Energy-Efficient Build., 2018, 209-223; Yu, Y., et al., Building Simulation, 2019, 12, 347-363; and Shen, P., et al., Energy, 2019, 173, 75-91, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). In some embodiments, a low-emissivity interior surface can result in up to about 67.7% energy savings relative to conventional materials, when heating is needed. Several embodiments show that in warm weather conditions however low emissivity interior surfaces are no longer appropriate and would result in about 38.5% energy penalty relative to high emissivity interior surfaces. Thus, tuning the interior surface's thermal emissivity can enable maximal energy efficiency throughout the year, and in response to varying heat loads and conditions in accordance with a number of embodiments."

                                "Many embodiments implement reducing radiative heat loss in interior spaces to keep occupants comfortable at lower air temperatures. In cold weather conditions, the human body can lose a significant amount of heat through both convective and radiative heat transfer to its surroundings. Since more than half this heat loss is from thermal radiation (See, e.g. Marino, C., et al., Sol. Energy, 2017, 144, 295-309, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference), embodiments according to the instant disclosure show reducing radiative heat loss in interior spaces can be an effective way to keep occupants comfortable at lower air temperatures. Most building materials including (but not limited to) paints have high emissivity (and absorptivity) in the LWIR wavelength. Thus interior surfaces can absorb the thermal radiation from the human occupant and emit back a smaller amount of thermal radiation corresponding to the lower temperature of the walls, ceilings and floors. An example of having low emissivity, high reflectivity, interior surfaces in cold-weather conditions in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is schematically illustrated in FIG. 1A. The interior surfaces can send back a large fraction of the radiative heat lost by the human occupant back to them, allowing lower air temperature setting, thereby reducing the need for heating energy while maintaining the same level of thermal comfort. Many embodiments assess the level of thermal comfort by the maintenance of constant skin temperature and fixed amount of body heat released by the human occupant.",
                                "By contrast, in summer and warm-weather conditions more generally, it is desirable to maximize the net heat rejected by the human occupant to their environment. An example of having high emissivity, high absorptivity, interior surfaces in warm-weather conditions in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is schematically illustrated in FIG. 1B. High emissivity (high absorptivity) materials in the interior of the building can be used to absorb the heat radiated by the occupant. By doing so one can maintain the same level of thermal comfort while using less cooling energy than it would be needed if the walls were low emissivity or high reflectivity. In many embodiments, tunability in the emissivity of the surfaces surrounding human occupants can optimize heat losses and/or heat savings depending on weather conditions and overall heat loads."

In winter, the heating air comes through the inlet, heats the room, and then comes out the room through the outlets. In summer, the cooling air comes from the inlet, cools the room, and then exits through outlets. Multiple human occupants (503) are placed inside the room. The multiple occupants scenario is implemented numerically in both cold weather and warm weather conditions. When there is more than one occupant in the same room, the heat source can be effectively multiplied and there is not only heat transfer between occupant and surroundings, but also between occupants in accordance with many embodiments. In typical cases, such as a classroom or movie theater, the space between different occupants is quite narrow. If the multiple occupants are treated as one and larger heat source, the emissivity effect will be enhanced according to equation (2) because of the area of the hot object increases. Extending this analysis when multiple occupants are in a same room, the low emissivity walls will not only reflect the radiative heat back but also the occupants' heat to them, which makes the occupants feel warmer than single occupant case. On the other hand, in summer, if the walls reflect most of the radiative heat back, the multiple occupants can result in a significant cooling load for the air conditioner. However, if the walls can absorb most of the heat, the energy used in cooling can be substantially decreased.",
