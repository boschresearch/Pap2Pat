    "title": "Development of novel antibodies for detection of mobile colistin-resistant bacteria contaminated in meats",
    "date": "2018-11-13",
    "abstract": "The recent discovery and rapid spread of mobile colistin-resistant gene, mcr -1, among bacteria isolated from a broad range of sources is undermining our ability to treat bacterial infections and threatening human health and safety. To prevent further transfer of colistin resistance, practical and reliable methods for mcr -1-containing bacteria are need. In this study, standards and novel polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MCR-1 were developed. Among nine mAbs, three were MCR-1 specific and six cross-reacted with both MCR-1 and MCR-2. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established using the polyclonal antibody as a capturer and the mAb MCR-1-7 as a detector. The assay had a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL for MCR-1 and 0.1 ng/mL for MCR-2 in buffer with coefficients of variation (CV) less than 15%. When applied to ground beef, chicken and pork, this ELISA identified samples inoculated with less than 0.4 cfu/g of meat, demonstrating its strong tolerance to complex food matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first immunoassay developed for MCR-1 and MCR-2. It should be useful for prompt and reliable screening of meat samples contaminated with plasmid-borne colistin-resistant bacteria, thus reducing human risk of foodborne infections with possibly no antibiotic treatment options.",

                "Colistin, also known as polymyxin E, is a bactericidal antibiotic with a broad Gram-negative spectrum. It acts by binding to the anionic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phospholipids in the outer cell membrane of bacteria, displacing divalent cations from the phosphate groups of membrane lipids. Bacteria are killed by the ensuring disruption of the outer cell membrane and leakage of intracellular contents1. Formerly, colistin resistance was thought to be solely caused by chromosomal mutations in genes involved in synthesis or modification of the lipid A, resulting in inefficient binding of polymyxins to the lipid A on the LPS2. Chromosomal colistin resistance may cause clonal spread in clinical settings3, but usually does not spread via horizontal gene transfer, thus has limited impact to outbreaks. However, in November 2015, a Chinese group discovered several colistin-resistant bacterial strains isolated from food animals and humans harboring a plasmid-borne colistin-resistant gene, mcr-1. This gene can spread from one type of bacteria to another4. It encodes a phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferase that catalyzes the addition of cationic PEA to lipid A component of LPS, reducing the negative charge of the cell surface such that the cationic colistin is unable to bind and initiate membrane lysis5. This was the first report for a transmissible colistin resistance determinant. Since then, plasmid-borne mcr-1 has been found in bacteria isolated from various food animals, the environment, vegetables and patients and spread onto at least five continents and more than 40 countries6\u20138. This resistance mechanism has even extended to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics, considered the drugs of last resort for such infections9. These discoveries are of great concern. Although colistin is an old drug that was discontinued for routine use in humans due to its kidney toxicity1, increased antimicrobial resistance, particularly the emergence of carbapenem resistance in clinically important Gram-negative bacteria, has renewed interest in colistin as a therapeutic option10,11. Recently, new plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant genes, mcr-2 to mcr-8 were identified12\u201318 and PCR-based screening found an even higher prevalence of mcr-2 than mcr-1 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains isolated from porcine and bovine12. It was found that mcr-2 to mcr-8 genes have 44 to 77% nucleotide identity to mcr-1 and their gene products have 32 to 83% amino acid sequence identity to MCR-1. The identity levels of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain are 72% and 87.4% between MCR-1 and MCR-2. Both MCR-1 and MCR-2 account for bacterial resistance to colistin through catalyzing chemical modification of the LPS-lipid A moiety with addition of phosphoethanolamine to the phosphate group at the 4\u2032 position of the sugar19.",
                "To prevent further spread of mobile colistin resistance to hospitals and other healthcare settings, which has already been observed4, timely screening for mcr-positive bacteria is critical. Currently, the main detection methods for MCR-producing bacteria can be classified into phenotypic and genotypic methods. Phenotypic methods are mainly culture-based antibiotic sensitivity testing by estimation of MIC using broth microdilution (BMD). These methods are cheap and easy to use, but have a long turnaround time and high discrepancies in MICs due to the polycationic nature of colistin that results in loss under experimental conditions20\u201322. Genotypic methods include conventional PCR, real-time PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PCR methods were used to amplify mcr genes mediating resistance to colistin23\u201325. These methods are faster than the phenotypic tests without an initial culturing step. However, PCR provides only indirect evidence for the presence of the mcr gene product, MCR protein, as it only targets the encoding nucleic acid. It often has a high frequency of false-negative or unclear results due to the small sample volume and inhibitors present in biological samples26, and a high frequency of false-positive results due to cryptic target sequences27,28, or dysfunction of promoters and operons responsible for colistin expression. It has been reported that a mcr-1 fragment was amplified by PCR from a colistin-susceptible E. coli strain from the fecal sample of a healthy pig29. WGS was used to understand the genetic determinants of resistance to colistin beyond the confines of the identified genes, followed by comparative mapping to a susceptible reference strain\u2019s genome to identify new resistance determinants4. However, this method requires skills and expensive equipment and reagents that are not commonly available in most laboratories in developing countries. To increase the current capability of detecting colistin-resistant bacteria, we sought to develop immunoassays that directly detect the presence or absence of the MCR protein, which is the functional enzyme responsible for colistin-resistance.",
                "Here we report the development of MCR-1 and MCR-2 standards, novel polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the MCR-1 and MCR-2 proteins and demonstrate the performance of these antibodies in various applications. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established and comprehensively evaluated with MCR-1 and MCR-2 standards, bacterial cultures, and simulated cross-contamination of meat samples. Our results indicate that the ELISA was highly sensitive, specific and has strong tolerance to complex food matrices, such as ground beef, chicken and pork, which is extremely valuable because colistin is widely used for controlling diarrheal diseases in cow, pig and poultry production30, and high prevalence of colistin-resistant bacteria has already been found in these food animals6,31,32."

                        "Full-length recombinant MCR-1 and MCR-2 proteins with an N-terminal His6-tag sequence were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells and purified using a HisTrap FF column (see Methods). The predicted size of the His6-MCR-1 and His6-MCR-2 is ~61\u2009kDa based on GenBank sequences (AKF16168.1 and SBV31106.1), but the size revealed on SDS-PAGE and western blots looked smaller than 61\u2009kDa (Fig.\u00a01a,b, lanes 4 and 5). These proteins are highly insoluble because they consist of five transmembrane domains in their N-terminal 200 amino acids and very difficult to purify. To confirm the intactness of the proteins we produced, mass spectrometry (MS) was performed. The N-terminal His-tagged full-length MCR-1 was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The peptides obtained from two proteases covered 60.6% of the MCR-1 sequence (Fig.\u00a01c). This suggests that the intact MCR-1 was recovered from E. coli. The failure to identify the N-terminal 100 amino acids by MS might be due to intrinsic hydrophobicity. Liu et al. (2016) reported that MCR consists of one membrane-spanning domain (residues 1\u2013214), one soluble catalytic domain (residues 215\u2013541)4, and sufficient amounts of soluble catalytic domain have been produced in E. coli33. Therefore, the C-terminal periplasmic catalytic domains of MCR-1 (cMCR-1, residues 214\u2013541) and MCR-2 (cMCR-2, residues 212\u2013538) were produced in E. coli and purified by HisTrap FF chromatography followed by gel filtration. The resulting protein preparations yielded a major band with molecular weight close to the expected size of His-cMCR, 38.4\u2009kDa (Fig.\u00a01a,b, lanes 2 and 3). Several minor proteins with MW larger than 62\u2009kDa were found in these partially purified protein preparations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), the identities of these proteins were unknown. These preparations were used as immunogens and standards for antibody production and immunoassays of MCR-1 and MCR-2 described below.Figure 1Analysis of His-tagged recombinant MCR-1 and MCR-2 proteins.

                        "Antibodies are key to immunoassays and provides the basis for the specificity and sensitivity of the assays. To develop polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to MCR-1 proteins, the recombinant catalytic domain, cMCR-1 (residues 214\u2013541) with His-tag removed, was used as an immunogen for antibody production (see Methods). Figure\u00a02a shows the ELISA results obtained using one of the immunized rabbit sera. Since the polyclonal antibodies (pAb) made in both rabbits had similar high antibody titers (\u22651:8,000) in their sera, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th bleed from two rabbits were pooled and used to purify IgG for further experimentation. The IgG purified from the pooled pAb bound to the recombinant cMCR-1 (with His-tag removed) very well. It also bound to a protein with a size close to the full-length recombinant MCR-1 in cell lysates of mcr-1 positive strains, AR-Bank #346 and AR-Bank #349, but did not bind anything in cell lysate of mcr-1 negative strain, ATCC25922, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a02b). These results suggest that the pAb is specific for the MCR-1. For mAb production and identification, we screened 1000 culture wells following splenocyte-myeloma cell fusion. Nine cell lines were selected for further investigation based on their antibody yields and ELISA titers. The mAbs produced by these cell lines were designated as mAb MCR-1-1 through mAb MCR-1-9. ELISA isotyping study indicated that the mAbs were predominantly IgG1, except for mAb MCR-1-7, which has an IgG2b type heavy chain. All nine mAbs possess kappa light-chains (Table\u00a01). To determine the reactivity of each mAb to MCR-1 and MCR-2, recombinant MCR-1 and MCR-2 catalytic domains and full-length proteins were analyzed by Western blot analyses following SDS-PAGE. Figure\u00a03 demonstrates that mAb MCR-1-7 binds to both MCR-1 and MCR-2, while mAb MCR-1-9 binds only to MCR-1, suggesting that mAb MCR-1-7 recognizes an epitope that is highly homologous in MCR-1 and MCR-2. In contrast, the epitope recognized by mAb MCR-1-9 resides in a region of structural difference between MCR-1 and MCR-2. The specificity of all nine mAbs for MCR-1 and MCR-2 is summarized in Table\u00a01. These antibodies could prove valuable in a variety of applications. The six mAbs cross-reacting with MCR-1 and MCR-2 are important resources for surveillance programs targeting a broad range of colistin-resistant bacteria from human and animals. The three MCR-1 specific mAbs could be useful for source-tracking purposes. The binding affinity of nine mAbs was evaluated by a direct ELISA, in which each mAb was allowed to react with the purified cMCR-1 directly coated onto microplates in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Figure\u00a04 demonstrates that the ELISA value for mAb MCR-1-7 is significantly higher than those for the other mAbs (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01).Figure 2Activity of immunized rabbit serum to MCR-1.

                        "To develop a sensitive sandwich ELISA for MCR proteins, each mAb was evaluated for its performance as a detection antibody by using the pAb as capture antibody (data not shown). In agreement with results obtained from the direct ELISA and Western blot analysis, mAb MCR-1-7 not only detected both cMCR-1 and cMCR-2, but also generated the highest ELISA signal among all mAbs tested in the sandwich ELISA, therefore, it was selected. Figure\u00a05 depicts the detection of the cMCR-1 and cMCR-2 in PBS within the range of 0\u201350\u2009ng/mL using the sandwich ELISA based on the pAb-MCR-mAb configuration. Good linearity was observed for cMCR-1 quantitation from 0.01\u20134\u2009ng/mL (R2\u2009=\u20090.98, Fig.\u00a05a inset); for cMCR-2 quantitation from 0.1\u20136\u2009ng/mL (R2\u2009=\u20090.99, Fig.\u00a05b inset). The average background signal was 563 counts per second (cps) with a standard deviation (SD) of 86.2 for the cMCR-1 ELISA and 833\u2009cps, SD 51.32 for the cMCR-2 ELISA. The limit of detection (LOD) for the cMCR-1 was 0.01\u2009ng/mL and 0.1\u2009ng/mL for the cMCR-2. The ELISA LOD for the cMCR-1 was 10-fold lower than that for the cMCR-2, but the signal to noise ratio for the cMCR-1 was significantly higher than that for the cMCR-2 at all concentrations tested, indicating that this ELISA is more sensitive for detecting the cMCR-1 than the cMCR-2. This is not surprising because both the pAb and the mAb were developed using the cMCR-1 as an antigen. This ELISA was built as one of the most common and affordable sandwich ELISAs, it has a great potential to be improved to meet the requirement needed for various applications by incorporating different signal generation mechanisms or assay platforms34\u201336. To evaluate the precision of the sandwich ELISA, the repeatability (intra-day) and reproducibility (inter-day) of the assay for cMCR-1 and cMCR-2 were evaluated. The intra-assay precision expressed as % coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 5% and the inter-assay precision (% CV) was less than 15% at concentrations within the linear ranges. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) recommends the intra-assay precision determined at each concentration level should not exceed 10% of the CV and the inter-assay precision should not exceed 15% of the CV37. The data obtained in this study indicate that the MCR-ELISA is a reliable assay.Figure 5Standard curves for ELISA detection of cMCR-1 (a) and cMCR-2 (b) in PBS. Luminescence counts (cps) were plotted against the concentration of MCR-1 and MCR-2 proteins (ng/mL). Data represent means of triplicate samples\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.

                        "Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance originated in bacteria associated with food animals4 and has been found in bacteria isolated from various types of meat worldwide6, threatening human health and safety. Rapid methods for identifying mcr-containing strains in food animals are essential. We estimated the sensitivity of the ELISA for detection of MCR-1 produced by bacteria using bacterial culture. Table\u00a02 demonstrates that the ELISA results were positive (above LOD: 227\u2009+\u200923\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009=\u2009296) when cell density was \u22650.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 for the AR-Bank #346 strain, and \u22654\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cfu/mL for the AR-Bank #349 strain. ELISA results for the mcr-1 negative strain, ATCC25922, were negative (below the LOD), at all cell densities tested, even at 8\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 cfu/mL, suggesting this ELISA is specific, and does not give false positive results. To validate the ELISA developed in this study for detection of food contamination with the plasmid-borne colistin-resistant bacteria using MCR-1 as a marker, food samples including ground beef, chicken, and pork were spiked with mcr-1 positive and negative strains (10 cfu/25 g). The average luminescence counts (cps) obtained from the negative control, Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (B-PER), was 667\u2009\u00b1\u200980 (n\u2009=\u20099). The average counts from the positive control (50\u2009ng/mL cMCR-1 in B-PER) was 751117\u2009\u00b1\u200915494 (n\u2009=\u20099). As shown in Fig.\u00a06, the ELISA counts for beef, chicken, and pork samples inoculated with Bacto Peptone Water (BPW, Becton Dickinson Company, Sparks, MD), ATCC25922, and ATCC29425 were all below the LOD (907\u2009cps). However, significant amounts of MCR-1 were detected in samples inoculated with the mcr-1 positive strains. The luminescence counts measured from the chicken were 106983\u2009\u00b1\u20092403 and 48447\u2009\u00b1\u20097981 for strains AR-Bank #346 and AR-Bank #349, respectively; 89230\u2009\u00b1\u20091784 and 88727\u2009\u00b1\u20091036 from the pork; 35940\u2009\u00b1\u2009897 and 76263\u2009\u00b1\u20091628 from the beef. Compared with ELISA signals obtained for water samples inoculated with AR-Bank #346 (805543\u2009\u00b1\u20096315) and AR-Bank #349 (679970\u2009\u00b1\u20096163), the signals obtained from the meat samples were relatively low (7.12 to 13.28% of the signals from the water samples), suggesting there were matrix effects associated with these samples. However, this ELISA was still sufficiently sensitive to identify colistin-resistant bacteria inoculated in these complex meat samples, unambiguously. It is worth to note that the results demonstrated in this study was obtained from mcr-1 positive strains, as other mcr-gene positive strains become available, similar validation assays should be performed.Table 2LOD for MCR-1 produced by E. coli using the MCR-1 ELISA.Bacterial strainmcr-1 genecfu/mLAverage countsSDAR-Bank #0346+4\u2009\u00d7\u200910540764+4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106887107+4\u2009\u00d7\u2009107109801164+4\u2009\u00d7\u20091081075033039+8\u2009\u00d7\u20091085558674447AR-Bank #0349+4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105283121+4\u2009\u00d7\u200910649051+4\u2009\u00d7\u20091076693387+4\u2009\u00d7\u200910871373679+8\u2009\u00d7\u200910845770323821ATCC25922\u22124\u2009\u00d7\u200910517017\u22124\u2009\u00d7\u200910624723\u22124\u2009\u00d7\u200910718340\u22124\u2009\u00d7\u20091082636\u22128\u2009\u00d7\u200910826755(\u2212) control (LB:B-PER 1:1)\u2212022723Figure 6Detection of MCR-1 in ground beef, chicken, and pork samples spiked with bacteria.

                "The recent emergence of mobile colistin-resistance in bacteria is of extreme concern as colistin is one of the last line antibiotics effective for severe infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. Current methods for colistin susceptibility testing are still fraught with pitfalls. In this study, standards, high affinity polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against MCR-1 and MCR-2 were developed for the first time. These reagents should be valuable for building various assay platforms for MCR-1 and MCR-2. A sandwich ELISA established using selected antibodies was shown to offer a unique combination of sensitivity and specificity that allowed detection of MCR-1, 0.01\u2009ng/mL in PBS and 0.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cfu/mL in cell culture. To simulate real-life assay performance, the ELISA was validated with food spiked with bacteria before culture enrichment and sample preparation. The assay displays great sample tolerance to various meats and the LOD for mcr-1-containing bacteria was less than 0.4 cfu/g of ground beef, chicken and pork. The simplicity and reliability of this ELISA makes it a good addition to the current protocols for unambiguous identification of colistin-resistant bacteria in real life samples and it\u2019s feasible to use MCR-1 as an indicator for the presence of viable mcr-1-containing bacteria."

PCR products were inserted into the pET His6 TEV LIC cloning vector (1B) (Addgene plasmid #29653). All four MCR-1 and MCR-2 constructs included an N terminal His-tag and were expressed in E. coli BL21DE3 cells. An overnight culture (20\u2009mL) was used to inoculate 1\u2009L of LB medium supplemented with 50\u2009\u00b5g/mL of kanamycin. The cell culture was then incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C with shaking until it reached an OD600 of 0.6; at this point, protein production was induced by addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 1\u2009mM. The culture was then incubated at 16\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009hours. Afterwards, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000\u2009rpm for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20\u2009mL buffer A (300\u2009mM NaCl, 20\u2009mM Tris, 20\u2009mM imidazole, pH8, 10% glycerol), supplemented with protease inhibitors (P8849, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO63178) and DNase (10\u2009ng/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Product: 4716728001). For cells carrying the full-length MCR-1 and MCR-2 proteins, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A plus 1% Triton-100. Cells were ruptured by sonication and the cell lysate was centrifuged for 1\u2009hour at 15,000 \u00d7 g. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22\u2009\u00b5m filter and loaded onto a 5-mL HisTrap FF Crude column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). The proteins were eluted with buffer A supplemented with 500\u2009mM imidazole, pH8, after the column was washed with five bed volumes of buffer A. cMCR-1 and cMCR-2 were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superdex 200 - XK 26/70 column (GE Healthcare). For cMCR-1, the N-terminal His-tag was removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease before gel filtration. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 280\u2009nm using an absorbance coefficient (0.1%) of 1.03 for cMCR-1 and 1.12 for cMCR-2 (ProtParam tool: http://www.expasy.org/tools/). Mass spectrometry for verification of the full-length recombinant MCR-1 protein was performed by UC Berkeley, Vincent J.

Following the third injection, sera were obtained (50\u2009\u00b5L/mouse) and evaluated for anti-MCR-1 titers. Mice with a strong antibody titer were boosted with a fourth IP injection two week after the third injection with a single dose of cMCR-1 (100\u2009\u00b5L at 10\u2009\u00b5g/mL in PBS without adjuvant). Three days later, mice were euthanized and their splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol as previously described41. The culture media of hybridomas were screened with a direct ELISA using 0.1\u2009\u00b5g/mL of cMCR-1 in PBS as the plate-coating antigen. The positive cell cultures were cloned 3\u20134 times by limiting dilution until selected hybridomas are clonal. Selected hybridomas were then expanded and antibodies were purified from culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using a Protein-G conjugated Sepharose column (Sigma, #P-32196) and bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1\u2009M glycine-HCl, pH 2.7. Purified IgG concentration was determined by absorbance measurement at 280\u2009nm using the Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) and absorbance coefficient (0.1%) of 1.36.

Different mAbs (1\u2009\u00b5g/mL in BB) were added to the plates and incubated for 1\u2009hour at RT after washing two times with TBST. After washing six times with TBST, the plates were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP (GAM-IgG-HRP, Promega, Madison, WI, 200\u2009ng/mL in BB) for 1\u2009hour at RT. Finally, SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was added and luminescence counts were measured in counts per second (cps) using the Victor-3 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Shelton, CT). The procedures and reagents used for the sandwich ELISAs were similar to the direct ELISA described except that the plates were first coated with the rabbit pAb against the cMCR-1 (1\u2009\u00b5g/mL in PBS), and then the MCR-1 proteins were added. The detection antibody was mAb MCR-1-7 (100\u2009ng/mL in BB). ELISA limit of detection (LOD) was determined using the lowest concentration of analyte that generated a response greater than the background plus three times the standard deviation. For each ELISA test, three independent experiments in triplicate were performed and one representative data set is presented. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant). ELISA standard curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). ELISA intra-day precision was determined based on results obtained from two independent assay runs within a day. Three replicates were analyzed for each concentration at each run. The % CV for each concentration was calculated by dividing the standard deviation (SD) by mean ELISA readings calculated from two runs (total 6 replicates) and multiplying by 100. The inter-day precision (% CV) was determined by dividing the SD of 3 day means by mean of 3 day means, and multiplying by 100."
