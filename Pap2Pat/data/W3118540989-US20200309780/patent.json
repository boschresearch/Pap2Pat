                        "Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies and each year it is responsible for around 120,000 deaths worldwide. Indeed, it is the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in women. For example, it has been estimated that in the United States one woman in 72 will develop ovarian cancer in her lifetime, and that one woman in 96 will die of the disease. However, despite advances in surgery and chemotherapies, no substantial improvement in ovarian cancer survival has been observed over the last two decades.",
                        "The most widely recognised risk factors for ovarian cancer are menstrual, reproductive and hormonal factors. However, a number of other factors have also been linked to the development of ovarian cancer and these include diet, adult height, weight, and smoking. Furthermore, there have been clinical observations suggesting a genetic component to ovarian cancer risk due to familial aggregations of ovarian cancer. Indeed, women carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been seen to be at higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.",
                        "The high mortality rate of ovarian cancer arises due to the asymptomatic progression of the disease resulting in over 70% of cases being diagnosed in advanced stages (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III and IV) when the cancer has spread to the abdominal cavity or to other organs. Detection of ovarian cancer when it is still confined to the ovary (FIGO stage I) is associated with a 5-year survival rate of about 90% compared to less than 30% for women presenting with advanced ovarian disease (FIGO stage III/IV). Therefore, the detection of ovarian cancer at an early stage is the best way to improve overall survival from the disease. However, at present there are no clinically applicable tests and biological markers available for the early detection and screening of ovarian cancer.",
                        "To date, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and HE4 are the only two protein-based biomarkers that have been clinically approved to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian lesions, to measure disease burden, and to evaluate ovarian cancer treatment. However, these markers are not elevated in all patients with ovarian cancer and may be increased in healthy women or women with benign diseases. Consequently, they do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for population-based risk assessment or early detection. For example, serum levels of CA125 greater than 35 U/mL in women presenting with an adnexal mass is the current gold standard for cancer diagnosis. However, elevated levels of CA125 are only observed in less than 50% of early stage patients and 70% of advanced stage patients. Consequently, CA125 is not a useful tumour marker alone for screening and early detection of ovarian cancer. The main utility of CA125 is for the differential diagnosis of ovarian masses and in cancer follow up.",
                        "There are several profound obstacles associated with traditional biomarker discovery focused on tumour-associated antigens. For example, there are quantitative obstacles in early-stage disease when the tumour is very small and therefore only very small quantities of the target antigen are produced (which might remain undetectable with currently available technology). There are also qualitative issues as the markers in many cases are incidental to the disease process and are often masked by the complexity of the examined biospecimens. The problem is further compounded by the genetic diversity of human populations and the influence of uncontrollable environmental factors meaning that potential biomarkers can be overshadowed by the high degree of natural variation in biomarker expression. Finally, obtaining a significant number of human samples of early-stage ovarian cancer for research is difficult due to the rarity of the disease diagnosed at this stage.",
                        "Given the lack of early detection tests and limitations of current approaches, there is an urgent need to identify new biomarkers for early stage ovarian cancer.",

A biomarker is differentially present between different phenotypic status groups if the mean or median expression level or amount of the biomarker is calculated to be different (e.g. higher or lower) between the groups. Therefore, biomarkers, alone or in combination, provide an indication that a subject belongs to one phenotypic status or another. With respect to biomarkers that are specific for a particular type of cancer, generally these would only be expected to be present in a subject having that cancer, but not present in a \u201cnormal\u201d subject not having that cancer. However, it is to be made clear that the biomarker of the present invention (Annexin A2) is differentially expressed at the earliest stages of ovarian cancer development and therefore is present in higher amounts in affected subjects who considered themselves \u201cnormal\u201d due to lack of phenotypic expression of the ovarian cancer.",

More than 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin given that they originate from the surface of the ovary. However, it is believed that the fallopian tubes and the peritoneum may also be the source of some ovarian cancers. Ovarian cancers are also categorised as gynaecological cancers.",

Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated CDRI, CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. The CDRs are held in place by more conserved framework regions (FRs). Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4, respectively.

The F(ab)\u20322 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u20322 dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region. While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, a person skilled in the art would appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de nova either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Therefore, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies, or those synthesized de nova using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g. single chain Fv) or those identified using phage display libraries (see for example McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348: 552-554).",

The chimeric antibodies may be monovalent, divalent, or polyvalent immunoglobulins. For example, a monovalent chimeric antibody is a dimer (HL) formed by a chimeric H chain associated through disulfide bridges with a chimeric L chain, as noted above. A divalent chimeric antibody is a tetramer (H2 L2) formed by two HL dimers associated through at least one disulfide bridge. A polyvalent chimeric antibody is based on an aggregation of chains.",

In another method (Lonberg N, 2008, Handb. Exp. Pharmacol., 69-97), first generation human antibodies to Annexin A2 may be produced by utilising transgenic animals that produce antibodies from human genes. When challenged with an antigen (i.e. Annexin A2 or an oligopeptide, peptide, or fragment thereof), these animals produce human antibodies avoiding the humanisation steps.

                        "A further technique for measuring the level of Annexin A2 protein using an antibody-based platform involves the versatile fibre-based surface plasmon resonance (VeSPR) biosensor, as described in PCT International Publication No. WO 2011/113085. Traditional SPR is a well-established method for label-free bio-sensing that relies on the excitation of free electrons at the interface between a dielectric substrate and a thin metal coating. The condition under which the incoming light couples into the plasmonic wave depends on the incidence angle and the wavelength of the incoming light as well as the physical properties (dielectric constant/refractive index) of the sensor itself and the surrounding environment. For this reason, SPR is sensitive to even small variations in the density (refractive index) in the close vicinity of the sensor, and does not require the use of fluorescent labels. The small variation of refractive index induced by the binding biomolecules such as proteins onto the sensor surface, can be measured by monitoring the coupling conditions via either the incidence angle or the wavelength of the incoming light. Existing SPR systems use the bulky and expensive Krestchmann prism configuration where one side of the prism is coated with a metal such as gold or silver that can support a plasmonic wave. Alternative SPR architectures have been developed based on optical fibres with the metallic coating deposited around a short section of the fibre. This approach reduces the complexity and cost of such sensors, opening a pathway to distinctive applications such as dip sensing. The material at the sensor surface is probed by monitoring the wavelength within a broad spectrum that is absorbed due to coupling to the surface plasmon. These techniques suffer from practical limitations associated with the need for careful temperature calibration, causing difficulty in analysing large numbers of samples consistently. VeSPR is a powerful variant of an optical-fibre based SPR sensor. VeSPR has a number of demonstrated advantages over existing SPR techniques including: (i) higher signal-to-noise ratio thus higher sensitivity; (ii) self-referencing of the transducing signal thus avoiding expensive/bulky temperature control; and (iii) the ability to perform multiplexed detection of different analytes using a single fibre.",

In laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, a sample containing the Annexin A2 protein is placed on the surface of a mass spectrometry probe, a device adapted to engage a probe interface of the mass spectrometer and to present the protein to ionizing energy for ionization and introduction into a mass spectrometer. A laser desorption mass spectrometer employs laser energy, typically from an ultraviolet laser, but also from an infrared laser, to desorb analytes from a surface, to volatilize and ionize them and make them available to the ion optics of the mass spectrometer. The analysis of Annexin A2 protein by LOI can take the form of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI\u2014as described for example in Karas M and Hillenkamp F, 1988, Anal. Chem., 60: 2299-2301; Tanaka K et al., 1988, Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 2: 151-153; and Norris J L and Caprioli R M, 2013, Chem Rev., 113: 2309-2342) or of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI\u2014as described for example in Hutchens T and Yip T, 1993, Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 7: 576-580; Tang N et al., 2004, Mass Spec. Reviews, 23: 34-44; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,719,060 and 6,225,047).",
                        "Other laser desorption mass spectrometry methods which may be employed include surface-enhanced neat desorption (SEND\u2014as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,137 and PCT International Publication No. WO 03/64594), SEAC/SEND (a version of laser desorption mass spectrometry in which both a capture reagent and an energy absorbing molecule are attached to the sample presenting surface), and surface-enhanced photolabile attachment and release (SEPAR\u2014which involves the use of probes having moieties attached to the surface that can covalently bind Annexin A2 protein, and then release the protein through breaking a photolabile bond in the moiety after exposure to light, e.g. to laser light).",
                        "With respect to measuring the level of activity of Annexin A2 protein, assays which exploit the known activity of Annexin A2 may be employed. For example, Annexin A2 is known to bind with tissue plasminogen activator on the cell surface to mediate the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Therefore, assays which measure the level of plasmin production by Annexin A2 in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator will be a reflection of the level and/or activity of Annexin A2. Annexin A2 has also been shown to interact with tenascin C and this interaction regulates cell migration and enhances cell proliferation of endothelial cells. Accordingly, assays which measure endothelial cell proliferation in the presence of Annexin A2 and tenascin C will be a reflection of the level and/or activity of Annexin A2 in a particular sample. Annexin A2 has also been shown to complex with S100A10 on the surface of cells potentially facilitating cell-cell interactions. Accordingly, methods which assay for cell-cell interactions in the presence of Annexin A2 and S100A10 will be a reflection of the level and/or activity of Annexin A2 in a particular sample. These are non-limiting examples and any other method which exploits the activity of Annexin A2 may be employed.",
                        "Methods for measuring the level of transcription of the Annexin A2 gene into mRNA are also known in the art. For example, levels of mRNA may be measured by techniques which include, but are not limited to, Northern blotting, RNA in situ hybridisation, reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), real-time (quantitative) RT-PCR, microarrays, or \u201ctag based\u201d technologies such as SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression). Microarrays and SAGE may be used to simultaneously quantitate the expression of more than one gene. Primers or probes may be designed based on nucleotide sequences of the genes or transcripts thereof. Methodology similar to that disclosed in Paik et al., 2004 (NEJM, 351(27): 2817-2826), or Anderson et al., 2010 (Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, 12(5): 566-575) may be used to measure the expression of Annexin A2 and one or more other genes of interest. Many methods are also disclosed in standard molecular biology text books such as Green M R and Sambrook J, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (4th edition), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2012.",
                        "With respect to RT-PCR, the first step is typically the isolation of total RNA from a sample obtained from the subject under investigation. A typical sample in this instance would be a tissue biopsy from an ovary or an ovarian tumour sample (and corresponding normal tissue if possible), although other sample sources are contemplated as described below. If the source of RNA is from a tumour, RNA can also be extracted, for example, from frozen or archived paraffin-embedded and fixed (e.g. formalin-fixed) tissue samples previously obtained from the subject. Messenger RNA (mRNA) may be subsequently purified from the total RNA sample. The total RNA sample (or purified mRNA) is then reverse transcribed into cDNA using a suitable reverse transcriptase. The reverse transcription step is typically primed using oligo-dT primers, random hexamers, or primers specific for the Annexin A2 gene, depending on the RNA template. The cDNA derived from the reverse transcription reaction then serves as a template for a typical PCR reaction. In this regard, two oligonucleotide PCR primers specific for the Annexin A2 gene are used to generate a PCR product. A third oligonucleotide, or probe, designed to detect a nucleotide sequence located between the other two PCR primers is also used in the PCR reaction. The probe is non-extendible by the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme used in the PCR reaction, and is labelled with a reporter fluorescent dye and a quencher fluorescent dye. Any laser-induced emission from the reporter dye is quenched by the quenching dye when the two dyes are located close together, as they are on the probe. During the PCR amplification reaction, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme cleaves the probe in a template-dependent manner. The resultant probe fragments disassociate in solution, and signal from the released reporter dye is freed from the quenching effect of the second fluorophore. One molecule of reporter dye is liberated for each new molecule synthesized, and detection of the unquenched reporter dye provides the basis for quantitative interpretation of the data.",
                        "In real-time RT-PCR the amount of product formed, and the timing at which the product is formed, in the PCR reaction correlates with the amount of starting template. RT-PCR product will accumulate quicker in a sample having an increased level of mRNA compared to a standard or \u201cnormal\u201d sample. Real-time RT-PCR measures either the fluorescence of DNA intercalating dyes such as Sybr Green into the synthesized PCR product, or can measure PCR product accumulation through a dual-labelled fluorigenic probe (i.e. TaqMan probe). The progression of the RT-PCR reaction can be monitored using PCR machines such as the Applied Biosystems' Prism 7000 or the Roche LightCycler which measure product accumulation in real-time. Real-time RT-PCR is compatible both with quantitative competitive PCR and with quantitative comparative PCR. The former uses an internal competitor for each target sequence for normalization, while the latter uses a normalization gene contained within the sample, or a housekeeping gene for RT-PCR.",
                        "The production and application of microarrays for measuring the level of expression of a gene at the transcriptional level are well known in the art. In general, in a microarray, a nucleotide sequence (for example an oligonucleotide, a cDNA, or genomic DNA) representing a portion, or all, of the Annexin A2 gene would occupy a known location on a substrate. Typically, the substrate includes a multitude of nucleotide sequences such that Annexin A2 and one or more other relevant genes can be assayed simultaneously. A nucleic acid target sample (for example total RNA or mRNA) obtained from a subject of interest is then hybridized to the microarray and the amount of target nucleic acid hybridized to each probe on the array is quantified and compared to the hybridisation which occurs to a standard or \u201cnormal\u201d sample. One exemplary quantifying method is to use confocal microscope and fluorescent labels. The Affymetrix GeneChip\u2122 Array system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif., USA) and the Atlas\u2122 Human cDNA Expression Array system are particularly suitable for quantifying the hybridization; however, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that any similar systems or other effectively equivalent detection methods can also be used. Fluorescently labelled cDNA probes may also represent the nucleic acid target sample. Such probes can be generated through incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides during reverse transcription of total RNA or mRNA extracted from a sample of the subject to be tested. Labelled cDNA probes applied to the microarray will hybridize with specificity to the equivalent spot of DNA on the array. Quantitation of hybridization of each arrayed element allows for assessment of corresponding mRNA abundance in the sample compared to the abundance observed in a standard or \u201cnormal\u201d sample. With dual colour fluorescence, separately labelled cDNA probes generated from two sources of RNA are hybridized pairwise to the array. The relative abundance of the transcripts from the two sources corresponding to each specified gene is thus determined simultaneously. The miniaturized scale of the hybridization using microarray analysis affords a convenient and rapid evaluation of the expression pattern for large numbers of genes. Such methods have been shown to have the sensitivity required to detect rare transcripts, which are expressed at a few copies per cell, and to reproducibly detect at least approximately two-fold differences in the expression levels.",
                        "In the subject, the expression level of Annexin A2 may be measured directly in the subject, or in an alternative embodiment, the expression level of Annexin A2 may be measured in a sample obtained from a subject. It is to be made clear that the sample obtained from the subject that is analysed by the methods of the present invention may have previously been obtained from the subject, and, for example, may have been stored in an appropriate repository. In this instance, the sample would have been obtained from the subject in isolation of, and therefore separate to, the methods of the present invention. Accordingly, the methods of the aforementioned aspects of the invention can be practiced wholly in vitro.",
                        "The sample which is obtained from the subject may include, but is not limited to, a blood sample, or a sample derived from blood (for example a plasma or serum sample or a fraction of a blood, serum or plasma sample), cervical pap smears, ascites, bladder washing, uterine washing, and a tissue sample from one or both ovaries, one or both fallopian tubes, or metastatic tumour tissue of the subject. In certain circumstances, the sample may be manipulated in any way after procurement, such as by treatment with reagents, solubilization, or enrichment for certain components, such as the relevant protein or polynucleotide under investigation.",
                        "In one embodiment, the sample is a plasma sample obtained from blood of the subject. Blood plasma is the pale-yellow liquid component of blood, in which the blood cells in whole blood would normally be suspended. It makes up about 55% of the total blood volume. It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume) and contains dissolved proteins, glucose, clotting factors, mineral ions, hormones and carbon dioxide. Blood plasma is prepared by spinning a tube of fresh blood in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off. Blood plasma, preferably supplemented with a clotting inhibitor, e.g. heparin or EDTA, has a density of approximately 1.025 kg/l. Blood serum is blood plasma without fibrinogen or the other clotting factors (i.e., whole blood minus both the cells and the clotting factors).",

The inventors have found that the expression level of Annexin A2 is higher in subjects with early stage ovarian cancer compared with normal subjects and compared with subjects with advanced ovarian cancer. Accordingly, an expression level of Annexin A2 in a subject which is higher than a reference expression level for Annexin A2 is indicative of early stage ovarian cancer in the subject, or indicates that the subject is susceptible to developing ovarian cancer.

In this instance, a reference expression level for Annexin A2 may be derived from at least one normal subject and is preferably derived from an average of normal subjects (e.g. n=2 to 100 or more), wherein the subject or subjects have no prior history of ovarian cancer. A reference expression level for Annexin A2 can also be obtained from one or more normal samples from a subject suspected to have, or which has, ovarian cancer. For example, a reference expression level for Annexin A2 may be obtained from at least one normal sample and is preferably obtained from an average of normal samples (e.g. n=2 to 100 or more), wherein the subject is suspected of having, or which has, ovarian cancer. However, a reference expression level for Annexin A2 may also be a level that is associated with a particular advanced stage of ovarian cancer progression (i.e. stage Ill or IV). In this instance, the reference expression level for Annexin A2 would be derived from at least one subject having ovarian cancer at a defined advanced stage of progression, and would be preferably derived from an average of such subjects (e.g. n=2 to 100 or more).",

The CA125 protein is characterised by a large extracellular domain containing up to 60 tandem repeats of 156 amino acids, and harbours the epitope for the original OC125 monoclonal antibody, as well as a heavily glycosylated amino terminal region. The molecular function of the CA125 protein has yet to be determined but it has been shown to function as a calcium dependent protease, and its presence in embryonic memberanes as well as its heavily glycosylated extracellular domain may allow it to have a role in the motility and metastatic potential of ovarian carninoma.",

This strategy identified several proteins that were specifically modulated by ovarian cancer cells when they interact with the peritoneum to maximise tumour cell attachment and survival. One of these proteins was the phospholipid calcium binding protein Annexin A2. Annexin A2 forms a complex with S100A10 and together they play a critical role in the plasminogen activator system. Annexin A2 binds with plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator on the cell surface which leads to the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a key enzyme which facilitates essential cellular processes involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. The inventors have shown that Annexin A2 is highly expressed in 90% of serous ovarian cancers and is actively involved in the process of ovarian cancer metastasis. However, to date, no studies have investigated the potential of using Annexin A2 for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, there has been no indication or expectation in the art that Annexin A2 may act as a plasma biomarker for early stage ovarian cancer.",

                                "**Serum and Plasma Samples**",
                                "Serum samples were collected from subjects with normal ovaries undergoing surgery for benign gynaecological conditions (n=30), subjects with benign ovarian tumours (n=37), early stage ovarian cancer subjects (stage I and II) (n=14) and advanced stage ovarian cancer subjects (stage Ill and IV) (n=72). Blood samples were collected into vacutainer plain tubes, the blood was allowed to clot, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature and serum was stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until assayed.",
                                "Plasma samples were collected from subjects with normal ovaries undergoing surgery for benign gynaecological conditions (n=15), subjects with benign ovarian tumours (n=21), early stage ovarian cancer subjects (stage I and II) (n=11) and advanced stage ovarian cancer subjects (stage Ill and IV) (n=24). Blood samples were collected into vacutainer tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA, the blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature and plasma was stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until assayed.",
                                "**Annexin A2 ELISA Assay**",
                                "Annexin A2 expression levels were measured using a commercial human Annexin A2 ELISA kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China). Briefly, 100 \u03bcI of standards and 10-fold dilutions of serum or plasma samples in PBS (pH 7.0) were added into each 96 well in duplicates. A capture Annexin A2 antibody was added and the absorbance reading measured using a plate reader at 450 nm. A standard curve of a different range of Annexin A2 antigen concentrations was performed in each plate and Annexin A2 concentration was determined from the standard curve. Expression of Annexin A2 was quantitatively measured in ng/ml. The detection limit of this assay was 0.321 ng/ml and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient was 6.1% and 3.3%, respectively.",
                                "**Results**",
                                "Annexin A2 expression levels in serum were 30% lower than in plasma (FIG. 1). Serum Annexin A2 expression levels did not differ amongst ovarian cancer and control subject groups (FIG. 2). However, surprisingly, plasma Annexin A2 expression levels were significantly elevated in early stage serous cancers compared to normal and benign groups (FIG. 3). Furthermore, plasma Annexin A2 expression levels were significantly elevated in early stage serous cancers compared advanced stage disease groups (FIG. 3). This represented a further surprising and unexpected result given that an elevated plasma Annexin A2 expression level in the early stages of ovarian cancer would imply that the elevated plasma Annexin A2 expression level would be maintained in advanced stages of the disease. However, this was not found to be the case. Ninety percent of subjects with early stage disease had plasma Annexin A2 expression levels greater than 300 ng/ml, whilst the non-cancer controls and the advanced stage group all had levels less than 300 ng/ml. A ROC curve of the non-cancer controls and early ovarian cancers was generated to determine the optimal cut-off value for plasma Annexin A2 (FIG. 4, AUC=0.995, P=0.001, Cl 0.98-1.00, P<0.0001) and the best cut-off point, 276 ng/ml, had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 100%. This is a marked improvement on current ovarian cancer markers such as CA125."

                        "This is the first study showing that Annexin A2 can be used as a diagnostic marker for early stage ovarian cancer. Plasma expression levels of Annexin A2, but not serum expression levels, are increased in early stage ovarian cancer compared with healthy controls, subjects with benign ovarian tumours, and subjects with advanced stage disease. Using a cut-off point of 276 ng/ml, a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 100% was achieved for detecting early stage ovarian cancer.",
                        "Several studies have evaluated blood Annexin A2 levels in cancers of the liver, breast, and bowel, but results have been very inconsistent. Indeed, a recent study has found that serum Annexin A2 levels are reduced in patients with colon cancer. Most studies have measured Annexin A2 in serum and data on plasma Annexin A2 is very limited. Plasma is qualitatively different from serum in which fibrinogen is removed through clotting. During the clotting process many proteins including plasminogen are removed by adsorption to the fibrin clot. As Annexin A2 binds to plasminogen, its level is likely to be reduced by this process.",
                        "In conclusion, for the first time the surprising and unexpected utility of plasma Annexin A2 as a diagnostic marker in early stage ovarian cancer has been described.",
