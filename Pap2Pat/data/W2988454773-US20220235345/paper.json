    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation begins when the cysteine protease, separase, cleaves the Scc1 subunit of cohesin at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Separase is inhibited prior to metaphase by the tightly bound securin protein, which contains a pseudosubstrate motif that blocks the separase active site. To investigate separase substrate specificity and regulation, here we develop a system for producing recombinant, securin-free human separase. Using this enzyme, we identify an LPE motif on the Scc1 substrate that is distinct from the cleavage site and is required for rapid and specific substrate cleavage. Securin also contains a conserved LPE motif, and we provide evidence that this sequence blocks separase engagement of the Scc1 LPE motif. Our results suggest that rapid cohesin cleavage by separase requires a substrate docking interaction outside the active site. This interaction is blocked by securin, providing a second mechanism by which securin inhibits cohesin cleavage.",

                "The protease separase initiates chromosome segregation in anaphase by cleaving the kleisin subunit (Scc1/Rad21) of the cohesin protein complex, allowing the duplicated eukaryotic chromosomes to be segregated to opposite poles of the cell1\u20133. Tight regulation of separase function is critical, as premature cleavage of cohesin can lead to chromosome loss and genomic instability.",
                "Separase is a large caspase-family cysteine protease (the human protein is 2120 amino acids/233\u2009kDa). Approximately one quarter of human separase is comprised of the C-terminal protease domain, which is conserved across eukaryotes and of which it is possible to make a structural model based on homology to orthologous structures4\u20137. The large N-terminal region is poorly conserved and there is currently no detailed structural model of this region in the human protein, although it is likely composed of superhelical repeats like those seen in structures of separase from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)5 and Caenorhabditis elegans6. Between the helical N-terminal region and the C-terminal protease domain, human separase contains regions that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a).",
                "Separase cleavage sites have a minimal consensus motif of ExxR, with cleavage occurring after the arginine1,2,8. Additional local sequence preferences have been identified9, including an acidic or phosphorylated residue immediately upstream of the ExxR4,8,10,11. In the structure of the separase protease domain from the filamentous fungus Chaetomium thermophilum, basic and acidic binding pockets accommodate, respectively, the glutamate and arginine of the consensus motif4. Two ExxR sites are thought to be cleaved in the human Scc1 substrate8. Human separase contains four ExxR sites in its central disordered region, three of which are subjected to autocleavage upon separase activation12. After autocleavage, the N- and C-terminal domains of separase remain bound, with no apparent loss of protease activity12. C. elegans separase has shorter but similarly located intrinsically disordered regions, and its structure reveals that association of the N- and C-terminal domains does not depend on the disordered polypeptide chain between them6.",
                "In early mitosis, separase is inhibited by a high-affinity interaction with the protein securin. Securin is thought to be intrinsically disordered when free in solution13, and the structures of securin\u2013separase complexes from budding yeast5 and C. elegans6 reveal that securin binds as an extended polypeptide along the length of separase (Fig.\u00a01a). A pseudosubstrate motif on securin interacts with the separase active site4,14, presumably blocking substrate interactions. Securin inhibition is relieved when the N-terminal region of securin is ubiquitinated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in metaphase, targeting it for destruction by the proteasome. Other vertebrate-specific modes of separase regulation have been identified, including inhibition by cyclin B-Cdk1 binding to separase in a manner dependent on proline isomerization by Pin115, but the specific molecular mechanism for this inhibition remains unknown.Fig. 1Production of active separase. a Cartoon of the securin-separase complex. The vertical dashed line indicates an approximate delineation between the separase N-terminal helical domain (green) and C-terminal protease domain (blue) containing the active site (orange). The C-terminal region of securin (dark purple) binds in an antiparallel fashion along the length of separase, and begins with the pseudosubstrate motif (red) bound in the separase active site. The N-terminal region of securin (light purple) contains the APC/C degrons. b Diagram of the securin-separase fusion construct. Colors correspond to a. Also depicted are the flexible Gly-Ser linker separating securin and separase (light gray) and the regions of human separase predicted to be intrinsically disordered (IDR, dark gray). See Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a for amino acid sequence. c Purified securin-separase fusion protein was analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue, using molecular weight markers as indicated. d Purified securin-separase (top) and apo (active) separase (bottom) were analyzed by negative-stain EM, and five representative class averages of each preparation are shown. Scale bar: 40\u2009nM. e Securin-separase binding to fluorescein-labeled DNA was evaluated by fluorescence polarization. Two 50\u2009bp dsDNA molecules with the same base composition but different sequence were tested, as well as a 25\u2009bp molecule. Data points indicate means (\u00b1SD) of triplicate samples. Source data are provided in the Source Data file. f Separase activation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, whereby securin is tagged for degradation and removed, can be recapitulated using an N-terminal ClpXP degron and the bacterial protease ClpXP. g Securin-separase fusion protein was incubated with TEV protease, ATP, and/or the ClpXP ATPase as indicated, and separase activity was measured by cleavage of an 35S-labeled Scc1 fragment (residues 142\u2013300) produced by translation in vitro. h Michaelis\u2013Menten analysis was performed with purified, active separase and the peptide DDREIMREGS, which includes cleavage site 1 in Scc1. The peptide sequence was flanked by the MCA fluorophore and DNP quencher, and cleavage was monitored by an increase in fluorescence. Initial velocity was normalized to enzyme concentration. Data points indicate means (\u00b1SD) of triplicate samples. Source data are provided in the Source Data file",
                "The ExxR separase cleavage motif is ubiquitous in the proteome, but very few of these motifs are known to be cleaved by separase. Human Scc1 contains six ExxR motifs, for example, but only two are cleaved in mitosis8. Local sequence context at the cleavage site9, as well as its accessibility, are expected to determine whether an ExxR motif is cleaved by separase. It also seems likely that there are other as yet unidentified mechanisms governing separase activity at the substrate level. Many proteases contain exosites: protease regions distinct from the active site that bind substrate sequences away from the cleavage site, thereby enhancing reaction efficiency16. The only evidence for separase regulation by substrate engagement outside of the cleavage site is that the securin-separase complex binds to DNA, helping to localize it to chromosomes17. While this binding results in increased cleavage of DNA-associated substrates, DNA does not enhance the enzyme\u2019s catalytic rate, and this interaction is too general to explain the observed specificity of separase.",
                "Separase was identified two decades ago1,2,18 and its central role in cell division is well established. However, many basic questions about its biochemical behavior and regulation remain unanswered, in part because of the difficulty of producing active protein amenable for biochemical and biophysical studies. It is well established that soluble separase can only be obtained in recombinant systems by co-expression with securin, as securin appears to be a co-translational separase-folding chaperone in addition to being an inhibitor19,20. Therefore, production of active separase typically begins with purification of the securin-separase complex, from which securin is removed using the APC/C-proteasome system (for human separase, an incubation with Xenopus egg extract serves this purpose)15,21\u201323. While this protocol is sufficient for certain experiments, it does not produce the quantities and purity of protein needed for detailed biophysical studies.",
                "In the present work, we used protein engineering to develop a method for the generation of active separase starting from a set of purified proteins. Using this active separase protein we discovered that rapid cleavage of Scc1 requires a sequence motif in Scc1 that is distinct from the cleavage motif, and which we predict interacts with a docking site (exosite) on separase. We also show that securin binding interferes with separase engagement of the substrate docking motif, identifying a second mechanism by which securin inhibits cohesin cleavage by separase."

                        "We sought to produce active human separase protein at a purity and scale sufficient for biophysical characterization. We focused on expression in Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses24. First, we optimized heterologous expression of the securin-separase complex by creating a gene fusion between the securin C-terminus and the separase N-terminus, separated by a Gly-Ser linker (Fig.\u00a01b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). This fusion was inspired by evidence that securin is a folding chaperone of separase19,20,25 and that these protein termini are co-localized24. Expression of the fusion construct led to protein levels that were significantly higher than those seen when securin and separase were co-expressed in Sf9 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Yield was improved further by N-terminal truncation of securin to remove its APC/C degrons and by elimination of the separase autocleavage sites by mutation (Supplementary Figs.\u00a01a, 2).",
                        "Purified securin-separase (Fig.\u00a01c) was characterized by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) (Fig.\u00a01d, top, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). The sample was monodisperse, and class averages were consistent with existing EM data for human securin-separase6,24.",
                        "Human securin-separase has been demonstrated to bind DNA in a non-sequence specific manner17. We evaluated whether our securin-separase complex showed similar behavior. Binding of securin-separase to a fluorescently-labeled 50 base-pair double-stranded DNA molecule was evaluated by monitoring fluorescence polarization as a function of protein concentration (Fig.\u00a01e). The data fit well to a one site specific-binding model with a KD of 300\u2009nM\u2009\u00b1\u2009100\u2009nM. A DNA molecule with the same base composition but different sequence yielded a similar KD (220\u2009nM\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u2009nM). Because the separase\u2013DNA interaction is not sequence-specific, we expected that the measured affinity would depend on length, with shorter DNA molecules exhibiting lower affinities. Indeed, a 25 base-pair DNA molecule bound with a lower affinity (KD\u2009=\u2009800\u2009nM\u2009\u00b1\u2009300\u2009nM).",
                        "Next, we sought to develop a method for activating separase using purified components, rather than the traditional method of using the APC/C-proteasome system in Xenopus egg extract. Analogous to the proteasome, the ClpXP protein complex consists of an unfoldase (the ATPase ClpX) and a peptidase (ClpP)26. However, whereas the proteasome interacts with ubiquitin to determine its targets, ClpXP recognizes specific amino acid sequence motifs (degrons) on its protein targets26 (Fig.\u00a01f). Additionally, E. coli ClpXP can be produced recombinantly much more readily than the proteasome. There is also precedent for the use of ClpXP to selectively remove a protein from a protein complex27. We added a ClpXP degron at the N-terminus of securin in our fusion construct, as well as a TEV protease cleavage site in the linker between securin and separase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Following purification and cleavage with TEV protease, incubation with a purified ClpXP variant with enhanced activity towards this degron28 removed securin and activated separase, as evaluated by cleavage of an Scc1 fragment in vitro (Fig.\u00a01g, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). Separase also cleaved a catalytically dead separase with intact autocleavage sites (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b), consistent with previous evidence that separase autocleavage can occur in trans29.",
                        "The ClpXP-activated separase was re-purified to remove TEV protease, ClpXP, and any separase still bound by securin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c-e). This purification yielded sufficient active separase to measure protein concentration spectroscopically and to perform basic biophysical characterization. First, we used Michaelis\u2013Menten analysis to analyze the kinetics of the interaction between the enzyme active site and a cleavage substrate. These experiments were performed with a 10-amino acid substrate peptide encompassing the best-characterized separase cleavage site in human Scc1 (169EIMR, or site 1) flanked by a FRET dye-quencher pair (Fig.\u00a01h). The results fit well to a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten curve, yielding a KM of 70\u2009\u00b1\u200930\u2009\u03bcM and a kcat of 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009s\u22121 (or 10\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009h\u22121). These results are consistent with a previous analysis of active separase reaction kinetics30.",
                        "A 50\u2009bp double-stranded DNA molecule did not have a significant impact on peptide cleavage reaction kinetics (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), consistent with previous evidence that DNA does not affect the proteolytic activity of separase17.",
                        "Finally, we evaluated the apo separase using negative-stain EM (Fig.\u00a01d, bottom, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). The sample was monodisperse and indistinguishable from the securin-separase complex at this resolution, indicating that separase does not undergo a large-scale conformational change upon securin removal. This result seems inconsistent with the previous suggestion that securin removal causes a major conformational change20. It should also be noted that the separase used here is the S1126A variant, which is unable to undergo (phospho)seryl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization15, so our results do not reflect any conformational change that may be associated with isomerization."

Though it is possible that DNA binding (Fig.\u00a01e) provides the extra affinity needed to boost function in vivo, this would be highly nonspecific if this were the only mechanism. We wanted to explore the possibility that separase has a more specific substrate docking site.",

To investigate whether local sequence context accelerates the cleavage of Scc1, we evaluated a series of Scc1 truncations with an in vitro cleavage assay (Fig.\u00a02a). Our starting point for this assay was an internal Scc1 fragment (amino acids 142\u2013400), which was chosen after we observed more robust cleavage of Scc1 by separase when the terminal regions that interact with Smc3 and Smc1 were removed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e compared to Fig.\u00a02b). This internal fragment does not contain site 2 (447EPSR), and so it is cleavage at site 1 (169EIMR) that is being evaluated here. However, even when site 2 is present, it does not appear to be cleaved in this assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e), perhaps because cleavage at site 2 requires other factors, such as adjacent phosphorylation by Plk111.Fig. 2Identification of a separase docking motif on Scc1. a Diagram of the Scc1 sequence, showing the locations of two separase cleavage sites, LPE motif, and boundaries of truncated constructs evaluated in panels b and c. b 35S-labeled Scc1 fragments were incubated with active or inactive separase as indicated, and reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Phosphorimaging. c Separase was incubated with an 35S-labeled Scc1 fragment (aa 142\u2013300) in which the indicated residues were changed to alanines. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Phosphorimaging. The sequence of the relevant region of Scc1 is shown",
                        "We observed an abrupt reduction in cleavage of the Scc1 fragment upon C-terminal truncation from residues 275 to 250 (Fig.\u00a02b), suggesting the presence of a separase-binding motif in this region of Scc1. Note that this assay has lower sensitivity than the above peptide cleavage assay, explaining why cleavage of the smallest fragments is not observed even though they contain the peptide sequence. Alanine scanning revealed that the most critical residues for enhanced activity were a Leu-Pro sequence at residues 255 and 256, with a contribution from Glu 257 (Fig.\u00a02c). We will refer to these residues as the LPE motif."

A biosensor containing a 10 amino acid deletion centered on 255Leu-Pro yielded identical results as the double alanine mutation, confirming that these two residues are key requirements for this interaction (Fig.\u00a03c, d).Fig. 3The LPE motif is important for cleavage of a separase biosensor in vivo. a Schematic of the separase biosensor used to evaluate cleavage in vivo, which includes histone H2B, red fluorescent protein (RFP), the indicated Scc1 fragment, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)33. b Time course of wild-type (WT) biosensor cleavage by separase, showing green fluorescence (left), red fluorescence (center), and merged images (right).

                        "Our results suggest that an exosite on separase interacts with the LPE motif in Scc1, resulting in higher substrate affinity and more efficient cleavage. An intriguing possibility is that securin binding prevents this interaction, providing an additional mechanism by which securin inhibits Scc1 cleavage. To address this possibility, we created securin-separase fusion proteins in which securin was truncated after the pseudosubstrate sequence that binds the separase active site (Fig.\u00a04a, Supplementary Figs.\u00a01b, 7). The likely pseudosubstrate sequence (113EIEKFFP) was identified previously based on homology between human and C. thermophilum securins4. We predicted that removal of the pseudosubstrate motif would relieve the inhibition caused by securin directly blocking the separase active site, but it would retain any effect of securin binding elsewhere on separase. The fusion approach also has the benefit of generating an extremely high local concentration of securin, compared to adding securin in trans. We tested three securin truncations. These constructs contain securin residues 127\u2013202, 138\u2013202 or 160\u2013202 covalently linked to separase via a flexible glycine-serine linker; they will be referred to as securin\u0394127-separase, securin\u0394138-separase, and securin\u0394160-separase, respectively (Fig.\u00a04b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).Fig. 4Securin inhibits binding to the LPE motif of Scc1. a Cartoon of the securin-separase fusion protein containing the full separase-binding region of securin (left) or with securin truncated on the C-terminal side of the pseudosubstrate motif (right).

                        "We first asked whether removal of the securin pseudosubstrate region from the active site is sufficient to yield a cleavage-competent active site. Michaelis-Menten analyses with the peptide assay described earlier (Fig.\u00a01g) showed that there are no significant differences between the peptide cleavage activities of the three securin\u0394-separase proteins and separase with no securin bound (Fig.\u00a04c). The securin (93\u2013202)-separase fusion protein containing the pseudosubstrate motif was inactive in this assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). These results confirm that the pseudosubstrate sequence blocks the active site, and they also suggest that securin binding outside the active site does not impair catalysis through some allosteric mechanism, at least for the portion of securin evaluated in these experiments.",
                        "We then tested whether the securin\u0394-separase constructs were able to cleave the Scc1 fragment in the gel-based assay, and whether this cleavage was sensitive to mutation of the LPE motif (Fig.\u00a04d). Securin\u0394138-separase and securin\u0394160-separase exhibited efficient cleavage of the Scc1 substrate, and in both cases activity was reduced by mutation of 255Leu-Pro. However, securin\u0394127-separase exhibited no cleavage activity in this assay. This result strongly suggests that securin interferes with separase binding to the LPE motif on Scc1, and that this interference is localized to a region of securin between residues 127 and 138. Intriguingly, this region of securin contains an LPE motif (residues 130\u2013132).",
                        "We developed an approach to investigate the importance of 130LPE for securin binding to separase. It is known that fungal securin can be converted to a separase substrate by making mutations that convert the pseudosubstrate site into a cleavage site4,14. We made the equivalent mutations in human securin (118FP to RE) and used this securinRE mutant to test the importance of 130LPE for securin engagement with separase. We also tested an LP sequence a few residues further downstream (139LP). In pilot experiments, a securinRE fragment containing residues 93\u2013202 was cleaved efficiently by separase, but mutation of either LP sequence had no effect, presumably because this fragment of securin makes too many contacts with separase for individual point mutations to significantly weaken affinity. We then tested a securinRE fragment containing residues 93\u2013150. This fragment was 50% cleaved by separase, and mutation of 130LP significantly impaired cleavage (Fig.\u00a04e). Mutation of 139LP had no effect, except when combined with mutation of 130LP. These results suggest that the 130LPE motif of securin interacts with separase.",
                        "Consistent with its importance in the regulation of separase, the LPE sequence immediately downstream of the pseudosubstrate motif is conserved in securin from vertebrates and in some lower eukaryotes (Fig.\u00a04f). Budding yeast securin carries a VPE sequence at this location, and the crystal structure of the yeast separase-securin complex indicates that the motif interacts with the surface of separase adjacent to the catalytic domain5 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). This region of separase is poorly conserved in human separase, precluding straightforward prediction of the LPE motif-binding site in the human protein."

                "Premature or partial cohesin cleavage can have disastrous consequences for a cell undergoing mitosis, and separase must therefore be tightly regulated. Several modes of separase regulation have been identified, most notably the inhibition of separase by the protein securin. Here, we identified a mechanism of separase regulation at the level of the separase substrate Scc1. Our evidence suggests that Scc1 contains a previously unknown separase-binding motif (the LPE motif), distant from the cleavage site, that enhances separase cleavage of Scc1.",
                "Our results also clarify the mechanism by which securin inhibits separase. The C-terminal separase-interacting segment of securin binds along the length of separase in an antiparallel fashion, starting with a pseudosubstrate motif bound in the separase active site. Securin sequences downstream of this motif are extended along the surface of the N-terminal domain of separase5\u20137. It had been predicted but not previously demonstrated that the presence of the securin pseudosubstrate motif in the separase active site was sufficient to inhibit separase catalytic activity. Our series of active separase constructs covalently bound by truncated securin (securin\u0394-separase) revealed that removal of the pseudosubstrate motif alone allowed wild-type rates of peptide substrate cleavage. Thus, the remaining regions of securin do not inhibit the separase active site through an allosteric mechanism. However, in the cleavage assay with longer fragments of Scc1, these constructs showed that securin binding interferes with separase engagement of the Scc1 LPE motif, revealing a mechanism by which securin inhibits separase activity toward cohesin (Fig.\u00a04g).",
                "We anticipate that cleavage of other separase substrates depends on LPE or other docking motifs. In meiotic cells, the Scc1-related protein Rec8 serves as the kleisin subunit of cohesin and is cleaved by separase. The major separase cleavage site in mouse Rec8, R45434, is followed by conserved LPE motifs about 50 amino acids downstream (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a), hinting that cleavage of Rec8 could depend on a downstream docking site like the one we describe here. It remains to be seen if LPE or other docking motifs are used to promote cleavage of cohesin across all species. Budding yeast securin contains a VPE sequence downstream of its pseudosubstrate motif (Fig.\u00a04f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), and yeast Scc1 contains an 376LPD sequence downstream of its major cleavage site (265EQGR) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010b), raising the possibility that docking is a deeply conserved feature of separase function.",
                "In vertebrate and yeast substrates, the LPE motif is located 50\u2013100 amino acids downstream of the separase cleavage site (Supplementary Figure\u00a010), whereas the motif is only 11\u201314 residues downstream of the pseudosubstrate motif in securin (Fig.\u00a04f; Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). Further studies will be required to assess the role, if any, of the large inter-motif region that exists in substrates but not in securin.",
                "The LPE motif expands our understanding of the local context that allows separase to preferentially cleave one ExxR sequence over another. However, the sequence requirements for a separase substrate remain poorly understood9. For example, in both our in vitro and in vivo assays we observed cleavage only at site 1 even when an intact site 2 was present, and despite the fact that there are conserved LPE motifs downstream of site 2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a). There is evidence that phosphorylation near site 2 (at serine 454) is required for cleavage11. However, when we moved site 2 to the local context of site 1 (i.e., changed the two residues between E and R from those present at site 1 to those present at site 2) we did not observe cleavage in our in vitro assay (unpublished results). Additionally, when we moved an extended sequence that encompasses site 1 into the context of site 2, no cleavage was observed in our in vitro assay (unpublished results). Further studies will therefore be required for a complete understanding of sequence requirements for separase cleavage.",
                "In the course of this work, we made significant advances in the production of active separase for studies in vitro. Previous studies of active human separase required the APC/C and proteasome in a crude cytoplasmic extract for removal and degradation of securin from the securin-separase complex. Here, we were able to produce active separase using simple, purified components by employing ClpXP to remove securin. Additionally, our securin\u0394-separase protein fusion constructs provide a way to easily produce constitutively active separase. We anticipate that these fusion proteins will be useful for certain types of separase studies, such as screens of small molecule separase inhibitors.",
                "Identification of a separase docking motif on Scc1 means that separase joins the growing list of proteases that are known to employ exosite-substrate interactions distinct from the active site-cleavage site interaction16. This additional interaction helps explain the discrepancy between the slow separase cleavage kinetics with the peptide substrate vs. the relatively fast kinetics observed in the cell33. Indeed, proteases often cleave substrates in vivo at rates that are orders of magnitude faster than those observed with short peptide substrates encompassing only the cleavage site16. It was previously demonstrated that DNA binding helps localize separase to its substrate, which is also likely to help explain the discrepancy between rates of cleavage in vitro and in vivo17. The separase docking motif identified in our work provides an additional, synergistic mechanism to enhance separase engagement with its specific substrate."

DNA encoding the N-terminal region of each protein (containing all or a subset of the following: LambdaO ClpX sequence, 2x StrepII tag, securin, Gly-Ser linker, TEV protease cleavage site, 3x FLAG tag) was codon optimized for insect cell expression and synthesized as a gBlocks gene fragment by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Separase was amplified from a human cDNA library, and mutations were made using either gBlocks gene fragments or fragment amplification and then assembled using Gibson assembly. All constructs contained the S1126A mutation to prevent (phospho)seryl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization and subsequent aggregation15. Catalytically-dead separase constructs contained the C2029S mutation. For all constructs with an intact active site, the autocleavage sites were mutated by reversing the E and R residues for each of the three sites12. All constructs were verified by full sequencing of the ~7000\u2009bp ORFs. The resulting plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac cells to generate bacmids through in vivo recombination. Purified bacmids were used to transfect Sf9 cells and generate P1 baculovirus. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were harvested 2\u20133 days after infection with P2 virus.
