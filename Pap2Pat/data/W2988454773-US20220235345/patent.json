                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The protease separase initiates chromosome segregation in anaphase by cleaving the kleisin subunit (Scc1/Rad21) of the cohesin protein complex, allowing the duplicated eukaryotic chromosomes to be segregated to opposite poles of the cell1-3. Tight regulation of separase function is critical, as premature cleavage of cohesin can lead to chromosome loss and genomic instability.",
                        "Separase is a large caspase-family cysteine protease (the human protein is 2,120 amino acids/233 kDa). Approximately one quarter of human separase is comprised of the C-terminal protease domain, which is conserved across eukaryotes and of which it is possible to make a structural model based on homology to orthologous structures4-7. The large N-terminal region is poorly conserved and there is currently no detailed structural model of this region in the human protein, although it is likely composed of superhelical repeats like those seen in structures of separase from budding yeast5 and C. elegans6. Between the helical N-terminal region and the C-terminal protease domain, human separase contains regions that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered.",
                        "Separase cleavage sites have a consensus motif of ExxR, with cleavage occurring after the arginine1,2,8. An acidic or phosphorylated residue immediately upstream of the ExxR promotes cleavage4,8-10. In the structure of the separase protease domain from C. thermophilum, basic and acidic binding pockets accommodate, respectively, the glutamate and arginine of the consensus motif4. Two ExxR sites are thought to be cleaved in the human Scc1 substrate8. Human separase contains four ExxR sites in its central disordered region, three of which are subjected to autocleavage upon separase activation\u201c. After autocleavage, the N- and C-terminal domains of separase remain bound, with no apparent loss of protease activity\u201d. C. elegans separase has shorter but similarly located intrinsically disordered regions, and its structure reveals that association of the N- and C-terminal domains does not depend on the disordered polypeptide chain between them6.",
                        "In early mitosis, separase is inhibited by a high-affinity interaction with the protein securin. Securin is thought to be intrinsically disordered when free in solution12, and the structures of securin-separase complexes from budding yeast5 and C. elegans6 reveal that securin binds as an extended polypeptide along the length of separase. A pseudosubstrate motif on securin interacts with the active site4, presumably blocking substrate interactions. Securin inhibition is relieved when the N-terminal region of securin is ubiquitinated by the APC/C in metaphase, targeting it for destruction by the proteasome. Other vertebrate-specific modes of separase regulation have been identified, including inhibition by cyclin B-Cdk1 binding to separase in a manner dependent on proline isomerization by Pin113, but the specific molecular mechanism for this inhibition remains unknown.",
                        "The ExxR separase cleavage motif is ubiquitous in the proteome, but very few of these motifs are known to be cleaved by separase. Human Scc1 contains six ExxR motifs, for example, but only two are cleaved in mitosis8. Therefore, it seems likely that there are other as yet unidentified mechanisms governing separase activity at the substrate level. Many proteases contain exosites: protease regions distinct from the active site that bind substrate sequences away from the cleavage site, thereby enhancing reaction efficiency14. The only evidence for separase regulation by substrate engagement outside of the cleavage site is that the securin-separase complex binds to DNA, helping to localize it to chromosomes15. While this binding results in increased cleavage of DNA-associated substrates, DNA does not enhance the enzyme's catalytic rate, and this interaction is too general to explain the observed specificity of separase.",
                        "Separase was identified two decades ago1,2,16 and its central role in cell division is well established. However, many basic questions about its biochemical behavior and regulation remain unanswered, in part because of the difficulty of producing active protein amenable for biochemical and biophysical studies. It is well established that soluble separase can only be obtained in recombinant systems by co-expression with securin, as securin appears to be a co-translational separase-folding chaperone in addition to being an inhibitory. Therefore, production of active separase typically begins with purification of the securin-separase complex, from which securin is removed using the APC/C-proteasome system (for human separase, an incubation with Xenopus egg extract serves this purpose)13,18-20. While this protocol is sufficient for certain experiments, it does not produce the quantities and purity of protein needed for detailed biophysical studies."

Using this active separase protein, it was discovered that rapid cleavage of Scc1 requires a sequence motif in Scc1 that is distinct from the cleavage motif, and which interacts with a docking site (exosite) on separase. It is demonstrated herein that securin binding interferes with separase engagement of the substrate docking motif, identifying a second mechanism by which securin inhibits cohesin cleavage by separase. The methods and polypeptide constructed provided herein allow for the production of large amounts of homogeneous, fully active enzyme for a variety of studies."

                                "Provided herein are polypeptide constructs comprising a securin fused to a separase. As noted above, separase is a cysteine protease containing a large superhelical N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal protease domain4, 5, 6, 21 The protease domain includes a substrate binding domain and a caspase-like catalytic domain. The substrate binding domain is characterized by a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 fold, having a four-helix bundle packed against an RNase H-like \u03b2-sheet. This five-stranded, mostly anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet also contains a two-helix hairpin extension between strands 3 and 4. The caspase-like catalytic domain contains a central six-stranded, mostly parallel \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices. Catalytic cysteine and histidine residues are located in the \u03b2-sheet in loops following strands 3 and 4, respectively. The large N-terminal region adopts an extended conformation in species such as H. sapiens (UniProt Q14674) and S. cerevisiae, while a closed conformation is adopted in species such as C. elegans. The N-terminal region contains multiple HEAT repeat units (26 in H. sapiens), with each HEAT having a pair of anti-parallel \u03b1-helices linked by a flexible loop, and a disordered region between the HEAT repeat units and the C-terminal protease domain. Securin binds in an extended conformation along the length of separase. For example, two short helices are the only secondary structural features observed by X-ray crystallography in the S. cerevisiae securin-separase complex. Residues 258-269 of the S. cerevisiae securin (corresponding to residues 113-224 of H. sapiens securin; UniProt O95997) lie in the separase active site upon formation of the securin-separase complex.",
                                "In some embodiments, the separase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 70% identity (e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity) to H. sapiens separase (SEQ ID NO:1), M. musculus separase (SEQ ID NO:7; UniProt P60330), C. elegans separase (SEQ IQ NO:8; UniProt G5ED39), S. cerevisiae separase (SEQ ID NO:9; UniProt Q03018), or S. pombe separase (SEQ ID NO:10; UniProt P18296). In some embodiments, the separase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 80% identity to H. sapiens separase, M. musculus separase, C. elegans separase, S. cerevisiae separase, or S. pombe separase. In some embodiments, the separase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 90% identity to H. sapiens separase, M. musculus separase, C. elegans separase, S. cerevisiae separase, or S. pombe separase. In some embodiments, the separase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 90% identity to SEQ ID NO:1.",
                                "Percentage of sequence identity can be determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the sequence (e.g., a peptide of the invention) in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence which does not comprise additions or deletions, for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage can be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",
                                "\u201cIdentical\u201d and \u201cidentity,\u201d in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences or nucleic acid sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Sequences are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to each other if they have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same (e.g., at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% identical over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection.",
                                "For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters. Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschul et al. (1977) Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits acts as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word size (W) of 28, an expectation (E) of 10, M=1, N=\u22122, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word size (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see, e.g., Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)).",

Filamentous fungi that are useful as expression hosts include, for example, Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Neurospora, Penicillium, Cephalosporium, Achlya, Podospora, Mucor, Cochliobolus, and Pyricularia. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,543 and Stahl and Tudzynski, Eds., Molecular Biology in Filamentous Fungi, John Wiley & Sons, 1992.",
                                "Commonly used prokaryotic control sequences, e.g., promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding site sequences, include such commonly used promoters as the beta-lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose (lac) promoter systems (Change et al., Nature (1977) 198: 1056), the tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Res. (1980) 8: 4057), the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1983) 80:21-25); and the lambda-derived PL promoter and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake et al., Nature (1981) 292: 128). The particular promoter system is not critical; any available promoter that functions in prokaryotes and provides the desired level of activity can be used. Standard bacterial expression vectors include plasmids such as pBR322-based plasmids, e.g., pBLUESCRIPT\u2122, pSKF, pET23D, lambda-phage derived vectors, and fusion expression systems such as GST and LacZ. Epitope tags can also be added to recombinant proteins to provide convenient methods of isolation, e.g., c-myc, HA-tag, 6-His tag (SEQ ID NO: 22), maltose binding protein, VSV-G tag, anti-DYKDDDDK tag (SEQ ID NO: 23), or any such tag, a large number of which are well known to those of skill in the art.",
                                "Either constitutive or regulated promoters can be used. Regulated promoters can be advantageous because the host cells can be grown to high densities before expression of the fusion polypeptides is induced. High level expression of heterologous proteins slows cell growth in some situations. An inducible promoter is a promoter that directs expression of a gene where the level of expression is alterable by environmental or developmental factors such as, for example, temperature, pH, anaerobic or aerobic conditions, light, transcription factors and chemicals. For E. coli and other bacterial host cells, inducible promoters are known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, the lac promoter, the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter, the hybrid trp-lac promoter (Amann et al. (1983) Gene 25: 167; de Boer et al. (1983) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 21), and the bacteriophage T7 promoter (Studier et al. (1986) J. Mol. Biol.; Tabor et al. (1985) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 82: 1074-8). These promoters and their use are also discussed in Sambrook et al., supra.",
                                "Translational coupling may be used to enhance expression. The strategy uses a short upstream open reading frame derived from a highly expressed gene native to the translational system, which is placed downstream of the promoter, and a ribosome binding site followed after a few amino acid codons by a termination codon. Just prior to the termination codon is a second ribosome binding site, and following the termination codon is a start codon for the initiation of translation. The system dissolves secondary structure in the RNA, allowing for the efficient initiation of translation. See Squires, et. al. (1988), J. Biol. Chem. 263: 16297-16302.",
                                "The construction of securin-separase fusion proteins generally requires the use of vectors able to replicate in bacteria. Such vectors are commonly used in the art. Kits are commercially available for the purification of plasmids from bacteria (for example, EasyPrep\u2122, FlexiPrep\u2122, from Pharmacia Biotech; StrataClean\u2122, from Stratagene; and, QIAexpress\u00ae Expression System, Qiagen). The isolated and purified plasmids can then be further manipulated to produce other plasmids, and used to transform cells.",
                                "The polypeptides described herein can be expressed intracellularly, or can be secreted from the cell. Intracellular expression often results in high yields. If necessary, the amount of soluble, active fusion polypeptide may be increased by performing refolding procedures (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra; Marston et al., Bio/Technology (1984) 2: 800; Schoner et al., Bio/Technology (1985) 3: 151",
                                "Once expressed, the polypeptides can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like (see, generally, R. Scopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, N.Y. (1982), Deutscher, Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182: Guide to Protein Purification., Academic Press, Inc. N.Y. (1990)). Substantially pure compositions of at least about 90 to 95% homogeneity (e.g., 98 to 99% or higher homogeneity) are provided in certain embodiments. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the polypeptides may then be used (e.g., in an inhibitor screen or mechanistic study).",
                                "To facilitate purification of the polypeptides, the nucleic acids that encode the polypeptides can also include a coding sequence for an epitope or \u201ctag\u201d for which an affinity binding reagent is available. Examples of suitable epitopes include the myc and V-5 reporter genes; expression vectors useful for recombinant production of fusion polypeptides having these epitopes are commercially available (e.g., Invitrogen (Carlsbad Calif.) vectors pcDNA3.1/Myc-His and pcDNA3.1/V5-His are suitable for expression in mammalian cells). Additional expression vectors suitable for attaching a tag to the fusion proteins of the invention, and corresponding detection systems are known to those of skill in the art, and several are commercially available (e.g., FLAG\u2033 (Kodak, Rochester N.Y.)). Another example of a suitable tag is a polyhistidine sequence, which is capable of binding to metal chelate affinity ligands. Typically, six adjacent histidines (SEQ ID NO: 22) are used, although one can use more or less than six. Suitable metal chelate affinity ligands that can serve as the binding moiety for a polyhistidine tag include nitrilo-tri-acetic acid (NTA) (Hochuli, E. (1990) \u201cPurification of recombinant proteins with metal chelating adsorbents\u201d In Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, J. K. Setlow, Ed., Plenum Press, N.Y.; commercially available from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, Calif.)).",
                                "One of skill in the art would recognize that after biological expression or purification, the polypeptide constructs may possess a conformation substantially different than the native conformations of the constituent polypeptides. In this case, it may be necessary or desirable to denature and reduce the polypeptide and then to cause the polypeptide to re-fold into the preferred conformation. Methods of reducing and denaturing proteins and inducing re-folding are well known to those of skill in the art (See, Debinski et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 14065-14070; Kreitman and Pastan (1993) Bioconjug. Chem. 4: 581-585; and Buchner et al. (1992) Anal. Biochem. 205: 263-270). Debinski et al., for example, describe the denaturation and reduction of inclusion body proteins in guanidine-DTE. The protein is then refolded in a redox buffer containing oxidized glutathione and L-arginine.",

Separase was amplified from a human cDNA library, and mutations were made using either gBlocks gene fragments or fragment amplification and then assembled using Gibson assembly. All constructs contained the S1126A mutation to prevent proline isomerization and subsequent aggregation13. Catalytically-dead separase constructs contained the C2029S mutation. For all constructs with an intact active site, the autocleavage sites were mutated by reversing the E and R residues for each of the three sites11. All constructs were verified by full sequencing of the \u02dc7000 bp ORFs. The resulting plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac cells to generate bacmids through in vivo recombination.

First, a gene fusion between the securin C-terminus and the separase N-terminus, separated by a Gly-Ser linker (FIG. 1B) was created. There is evidence that securin is a folding chaperone of separase17,22 and that these protein termini are co-localized21. Expression of the fusion construct led to protein levels that were significantly higher than those seen when securin and separase were co-expressed in Sf9 cells. Yield was improved further by N-terminal truncation of securin to remove its APC/C degrons and by elimination of the separase autocleavage sites by mutation.",
                                "Purified securin-separase (FIG. 1C) was characterized by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) (FIG. 1D, top). The sample was monodisperse, and class averages were consistent with existing EM data for human securin-separase6,21.",

The data fit well to a one site specific-binding model with a KD of 300 nM+/\u2212100 nM. A DNA molecule with the same base composition but different sequence yielded a similar KD (220 nM+/\u221260 nM). Because the separase-DNA interaction is not sequence-specific, it was expected that the measured affinity would depend on length, with shorter DNA molecules exhibiting lower affinities. Indeed, a 25 base-pair DNA molecule bound with a lower affinity (KD=800 nM+/\u2212300 nM).",
                                "Next, a method for activating separase using purified components was developed, rather than the traditional method of using the APC/C-proteasome system in Xenopus egg extract. Analogous to the proteasome, the ClpXP protein complex consists of an unfoldase (the ATPase ClpX) and a peptidase (ClpP)23. However, whereas the proteasome interacts with ubiquitin to determine its targets, ClpXP engages with specific short amino acid sequences23 (FIG. 1F). Additionally, E. coli ClpXP can be produced recombinantly much more readily than the proteasome. There is also precedent for the use of ClpXP to selectively remove a protein from a protein complex24. A ClpXP recognition site was added at the N-terminus of securin in the fusion construct, as well as a TEV protease cleavage site in the linker between securin and separase. Following purification and cleavage with TEV protease, incubation with purified ClpXP removed securin and activated separase, as evaluated by cleavage of an Scc1 fragment in vitro (FIG. 1G). Separase also cleaved a catalytically-dead separase with intact autocleavage sites, demonstrating that separase autocleavage can occur in trans.",

This purification yielded sufficient active separase to measure protein concentration spectroscopically and to perform basic biophysical characterization. First, Michaelis-Menten analysis was used to analyze the kinetics of the interaction between the enzyme active site and a cleavage substrate. These experiments were performed with a substrate peptide encompassing the best-characterized separase cleavage site in human Scc1 (169EIMR (SEQ ID NO: 27), or \u201csite 1\u201d) flanked by a FRET dye-quencher pair (FIG. 1H).

Though it is possible that DNA binding (FIG. 1E) provides the extra affinity needed to boost function in vivo, this would be highly nonspecific if this were the only mechanism. The possibility that separase has a more specific substrate docking site was therefore explored.",

To investigate whether local sequence context accelerates the cleavage of Scc1, a series of Scc1 truncations was evaluated with an in vitro cleavage assay (FIG. 2A). The starting point for this assay was an internal Scc1 fragment (amino acids 142-400), which was chosen after more robust cleavage of Scc1 by separase was observed when the terminal regions that interact with Smc3 and Smc1 were removed. This internal fragment does not contain site 2 (447EPSR (SEQ ID NO: 28)), and so it is cleavage at site 1 (169EIMR (SEQ ID NO: 27)) that was evaluated here. However, even when site 2 is present, it did not appear to be cleaved in this assay, perhaps because cleavage at site 2 requires other factors, such as adjacent phosphorylation by Plk110.",

Note that this assay has lower sensitivity than the above peptide cleavage assay, explaining why cleavage of the smallest fragments is not observed even though they contain the peptide sequence. Alanine scanning revealed that the most critical residues for enhanced activity were a Leu-Pro sequence at residues 255 and 256, with a contribution from Glu 257 (FIG. 2C).

A previously described separase biosensor in human U2OS cells (FIG. 3A)28 was recreated for this purpose. With wild-type Scc1 (aa 142-467), efficient biosensor cleavage was observed during anaphase (FIG. 3B). Strikingly, the double point mutation255Leu-Pro 4 Ala-Ala reduced cleavage efficiency by 50% (FIGS. 3C, D). A biosensor containing a 10 amino acid deletion centered on 255Leu-Pro yielded identical results as the double alanine mutation, confirming that these two residues are key requirements for this interaction (FIGS. 3C, D). Although separase cleavage site 2 is present in this biosensor, it was not cleaved in the assay, nor was it cleaved in a longer version of the biosensor that extended 123 amino acids beyond site 2. Therefore, the observation that 255Leu-Pro promotes biosensor cleavage is specific to site 1.",

                                "The results above suggest that an exosite on separase interacts with the LPE motif in Scc1, resulting in higher substrate affinity and more efficient cleavage. An intriguing possibility is that securin binding prevents this interaction, providing an additional mechanism by which securin inhibits Scc1 cleavage. To address this possibility, securin-separase fusion proteins were created in which securin was truncated after the pseudosubstrate sequence that binds the separase active site (FIG. 4A). The likely pseudosubstrate sequence (113EIEKFFP (SEQ ID NO: 26)) was identified previously based on homology between human and C. thermophilum securins4. It was hypothesized that removal of the pseudosubstrate motif would relieve the inhibition caused by securin directly blocking the separase active site, but that it would retain any effect of securin binding elsewhere on separase. It was also hypothesized that the fusion approach would have the benefit of generating an extremely high local concentration of securin, compared to adding securin in trans. Three securin truncations were tested, having securin residues 127-202, 138-202 or 160-202 covalently linked to separase via a flexible glycine-serine linker. The constructs are referred to hereinafter as securin\u0394127-separase, securin\u0394138-separase, and securin\u0394160-separase, respectively (FIG. 4B).",
                                "It was first asked whether removal of the securin pseudosubstrate region from the active site was sufficient to yield a cleavage-competent active site. Michaelis-Menten analyses with the peptide assay described above (FIG. 1G) showed that there were no significant differences between the peptide cleavage activities of the three securin\u0394-separase proteins and separase with no securin bound (FIG. 4C). These results confirmed that the pseudosubstrate sequence blocks the active site, and they also suggested that securin binding outside the active site does not impair catalysis through some allosteric mechanism.",
                                "Experiments were then conducted to test whether the securin\u0394-separase constructs were able to cleave the Scc1 fragment in the gel-based assay, and whether this cleavage was sensitive to mutation of the LPE motif (FIG. 4D). Securin\u0394138-separase and securin\u0394160-separase exhibited efficient cleavage of the Scc1 substrate, and in both cases activity was reduced by mutation of 255Leu-Pro. However, securin\u0394127-separase exhibited no cleavage activity in this assay. This result strongly suggests that securin interferes with separase binding to the LPE motif on Scc1, and that this interference is localized to a region of securin between residues 127 and 138. Intriguingly, this region of securin contains an LPE motif (residues 130-132).",
                                "An approach for investigating the importance of 130LPE for securin binding to separase was developed. It is known that fungal securin can be converted to a separase substrate by making mutations that convert the pseudosubstrate site into a cleavage site4. The equivalent mutations were made in human securin (118FP to RE) and this securinRE mutant was used to test the importance of 130LPE for securin engagement with separase. An LP sequence a few residues further downstream (139LP) was also tested. In initial experiments, a securinRE fragment containing residues 93-202 was cleaved efficiently by separase, but mutation of either LP sequence had no effect, presumably because this fragment of securin makes too many contacts with separase for individual point mutations to significantly weaken affinity. A securinRE fragment containing residues 93-150 was then tested. This fragment was 50% cleaved by separase, and mutation of 130LP significantly impaired cleavage (FIG. 4E). Mutation of 139LP had no effect, except when combined with mutation of 130LP. These results indicate that the 130LPE motif of securin interacts with separase.",
                                "Consistent with its importance in the regulation of separase, the LPE sequence immediately downstream of the pseudosubstrate motif is conserved in securin from vertebrates and in some lower eukaryotes (FIG. 4F). Budding yeast securin carries a VPE sequence at this location, and the crystal structure of the yeast separase-securin complex indicates that the valine and proline interact with the surface of separase adjacent to the catalytic domains. This region of the human separase differs from the yeast separase, precluding straightforward prediction of the precise LPE motif-binding site in the human protein.",
                                "The major current method for separase productions depends on removal of securin from small amounts of securin-separase complex using extracts of frog eggs. This generates very small amounts of impure enzyme and is not widely used. There are no currently-available commercial sources of separase, and no previous method could be scaled up to produce large amounts of homogeneous enzyme. As such, the biochemical behavior of the enzyme has remained largely unexplored in the 20 years since it was discovered. The separase constructs of the present disclosure allow for the new discovery of important enzyme characteristics such as the LPE motif described herein."
