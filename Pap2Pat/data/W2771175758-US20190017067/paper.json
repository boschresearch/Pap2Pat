    "abstract": "Effective weed control can protect yields of cassava (Manihot esculenta) storage roots. Farmers could benefit from using herbicide with a tolerant cultivar. We applied traditional transgenesis and gene editing to generate robust glyphosate tolerance in cassava. By comparing promoters regulating expression of transformed 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) genes with various paired amino acid substitutions, we found that strong constitutive expression is required to achieve glyphosate tolerance during in vitro selection and in whole cassava plants. Using strategies that exploit homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways, we precisely introduced the best-performing allele into the cassava genome, simultaneously creating a promoter swap and dual amino acid substitutions at the endogenous EPSPS locus. Primary EPSPS-edited plants were phenotypically normal, tolerant to high doses of glyphosate, with some free of detectable T-DNA integrations. Our methods demonstrate an editing strategy for creating glyphosate tolerance in crop plants and demonstrate the potential of gene editing for further improvement of cassava.",

                "Among chemical weed control agents, the broad\u2010spectrum herbicide glyphosate is favoured for its high efficacy, low cost, low environmental persistence, flexible application requirements and safety (Duke and Powles, 2008). Glyphosate competitively inhibits the EPSPS\u2010catalysed synthesis of aromatic amino acids and secondary metabolites in plant chloroplasts by mimicking a transition state of 5\u2010enolpyruvylshikimate\u20103\u2010phosphate from phosphoenol pyruvate and shikimate\u20103\u2010phosphate (Sch\u00f6nbrunn et\u00a0al., 2001). Amino acid substitutions that render plant EPSPS less sensitive to glyphosate are well characterized (Sammons and Gaines, 2014), and gene editing approaches have been used to introduce some of these mutations into crop plants. For example, the T102I/P106S (TIPS) and T102I/P106A (TIPA) double amino acid substitutions were introduced into rice (Li et\u00a0al., 2016) (Oryza sativa) and flax (Sauer et\u00a0al., 2016) (Linum usitatissimum), respectively. However, tests of glyphosate tolerance at the whole plant level were assessed with low concentrations of active ingredient (AI) (<0.5%), leaving uncertainty as to whether this approach can achieve robust tolerance in the field. In commercialized GA21 transgenic corn (Monsanto, 2002), the TIPS enzyme, expressed from the strong constitutive rice actin promoter and intron, was present in 3\u20135 functional copies, suggesting high expression is necessary to achieve agronomically relevant glyphosate tolerance. TIPS\u2010edited rice, as well as spontaneous TIPS mutations in wild goosegrass (Eleusine indica), reduced fitness in the absence of herbicide, presumably due to the lower catalytic efficiency of the mutated enzyme (Funke et\u00a0al., 2009; Yu et\u00a0al., 2015) without a compensatory increase in expression. Before editing the EPSPS allele to produce high levels of glyphosate tolerance in cassava, it was therefore necessary to assess herbicide tolerance and fitness of plants with EPSPS variants expressed from the native cassava EPSPS promoter versus plants with the same variants expressed from a strong constitutive promoter."

                "Two functional EPSPS genes exist in cassava, Manes.05G046900 and Manes.01G266800 (Bredeson et\u00a0al., 2016). Of these, Manes.05G046900 was chosen for this study because it is expressed more strongly in 11 different tissues, including 25\u2010fold greater expression in the shoot apical meristem (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2017). We generated a series of T\u2010DNAs with expression cassettes for three variants of EPSPS. These were expressed from either the cassava EPSPS promoter (2.2\u00a0kb of sequence upstream of the first codon), or by the tandemly repeated cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (2x35S) promoter, and are hereafter referred to as gene models (Figure\u00a0S1). The 2x35S promoter exhibits strong, constitutive expression in cassava (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2017). Each gene model was transformed into cassava cultivar TME 204 (Chauhan et\u00a0al., 2015), and leaf discs of plants derived from transgenic events were tested for shikimate accumulation in the presence of glyphosate (Shaner et\u00a0al., 2005). Leaf discs with enzymes expressed by the 2x35S promoter exhibited significantly higher EPSPS activity than discs with the same enzymes under control of the cassava EPSPS promoter, and double amino acid substitution variants were more tolerant to glyphosate than the wild\u2010type (WT) enzyme (Figures\u00a01a and S2). Clonal replicates from 10 independent transformation events with each gene model were verified by endpoint PCR, propagated, established in the glasshouse and assessed for damage after foliar application of glyphosate isopropylamine salt at a rate of 50\u00a0mg AI per plant. As predicted by the shikimate accumulation assay, plants harbouring EPSPS enzymes expressed from the 2x35S promoter exhibited significantly less injury over the 23\u2010day observation period compared to plants with enzymes expressed from the native cassava EPSPS promoter (Figures\u00a01b and S3). These observations indicate the importance of expression profile in glyphosate tolerance strategies based on plant EPSPS enzymes. The strongly expressed TIPA and G101A/A192T (GAAT) EPSPS variants supported more vigorous growth than the T102I/P106I (TIPI) enzyme (Figures\u00a01c,d and S4), suggesting these alleles are also best suited to support plant fitness when the WT locus is permanently replaced by gene editing.",
                "To assess which EPSPS expression cassettes enabled in\u00a0vitro selection of modified cells, transformations with the gene model constructs were repeated, and plants regenerated on media containing 2.5\u20135\u00a0mm glyphosate. Of 30 recovered events, 29 were obtained with cassettes containing the 2x35S promoter driving expression of EPSPS variants (Table\u00a0S1), demonstrating that strong expression is required for effective in\u00a0vitro glyphosate tolerance. In vitro rooting assays, comparing the ability of micropropagated stem cuttings to form roots in media containing glyphosate (Figure\u00a0S5), also indicated that the TIPA enzyme under control of the 2x35S promoter enabled growth of significantly more and longer roots compared to either the TIPA enzyme expressed from the native promoter or the WT enzyme under control of either promoter. Combined, these analyses show utility of the TIPA enzyme, when expressed under control of the strong constitutive 2x35S promoter, for providing tolerance to glyphosate in cassava.",
                "With knowledge acquired from production and characterization of the EPSPS transgene models, we sought to generate plants with EPSPS alleles precisely edited for best tolerance to glyphosate. A strategy was developed to replace the endogenous EPSPS promoter and first two exons with a strong constitutive promoter and the TIPA amino acid substitutions. To achieve this, we identified CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease (Jinek et\u00a0al., 2012) targets in the promoter and second intron of the EPSPS locus that caused a 3.2\u2010kb deletion when co\u2010expressed in cassava protoplasts (Figure\u00a0S6). Two repair templates were constructed to mediate correction of the disrupted locus by either homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end\u2010joining (NHEJ; Figure\u00a02a). Repair templates and expression cassettes for Cas9 and single\u2010guide RNAs (sgRNA) were combined in a standard cloning vector or incorporated in a vector as part of a geminivirus replicon (GVR) derived from the bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) (Baltes et\u00a0al., 2014). After verifying circularization of the BeYDV GVR in cassava callus cells (Figure\u00a0S7), we transformed protoplasts and harvested genomic DNA after 48\u00a0h. Using a selective PCR amplification strategy, with one primer directed to the genomic EPSPS locus and one primer directed to the repair template, EPSPS gene editing was confirmed at the left and right junctions of events derived from both repair templates (Figure\u00a0S8). Sanger sequencing of clones derived from editing events with the repair template configured for both NHEJ and HR repair indicated 14 of the 16 recovered junction sequences occurred by NHEJ\u2010mediated correction, while only two occurred by HR.",
                "Having verified functionality of the gene editing components in transient systems, we transferred the editing reagents to T\u2010DNA vectors, transformed cassava cultivar TME 419 and regenerated plants under glyphosate selection. Of six independent glyphosate\u2010resistant plant lines recovered from repair templates on standard T\u2010DNAs, precise EPSPS editing was confirmed in four lines by PCR and DNA sequencing of both the edited allele (Figures\u00a02b) and the left and right junctions (Figure\u00a0S9). The presence of a precise right\u2010junction without left\u2010junction or complete allele amplicons suggested the remaining two glyphosate\u2010resistant lines \u2013 event #3 from the H055 vector and event #8 from the H056 vector \u2013 were derived from one\u2010sided events, in which extra vector sequence may have integrated at the left junction, preventing amplification over that region. This is consistent with the herbicide tolerance of these lines, because precise right\u2010junction events would be expected to produce a functional EPSPS cassette. Precise editing frequency as high as 0.13 events per cm3 settled cell volume (SCV) of embryogenic callus was achieved with the standard T\u2010DNA configured for HR\u2010mediated DSB repair \u2013 the most efficient editing strategy among those tested (Table\u00a01). Compared to recovery of 16 transformation events per cm3 SCV obtained with the 2x35S\u2010driven TIPA gene model vector (Table\u00a0S1), this represents an editing efficiency of about 1% of the frequency of random integration events recovered using the same selection system.",
                "Unexpectedly, several events were recovered that appeared to be the result of both NHEJ\u2010 and HR\u2010mediated repair. Sequences derived from the CRISPR target sites in the H055 NHEJ repair template were identified at the endogenous EPSPS gene that could only have been copied into this locus by HR. Interestingly, these sites carry mutations indicating that imprecise NHEJ disrupted the nuclease target sequence either before or after genomic incorporation of the repair template by HR (Figure\u00a0S9). NHEJ may have resulted in excision of some HR\u2010mediated repair template integrations, which could explain the low recovery of events with this vector. That the two precise events in plants recovered from the H055 vector were derived from HR\u2010mediated repair contrasts with the dominant pattern of NHEJ repair by the same template in protoplasts.",
                "By increasing repair template abundance and inducing cell cycle phases that favour HR (Hanley\u2010Bowdoin et\u00a0al., 2013), GVRs enhance homologous recombination efficiency in tobacco (Baltes et\u00a0al., 2014), tomato (\u010cerm\u00e1k et\u00a0al., 2015) and wheat (Gil\u2010Humanes et\u00a0al., 2017). In this study, three of the four events derived with the BeYDV GVR appeared to contain precisely edited EPSPS; however, lines #3 and #5 also produced amplicons suggestive of imprecise EPSPS repair, with a large portion of the vector integrated at the target (data not shown). This, combined with the presence of the WT allele, suggests a complex genotype, or possibly mosaicism, in these lines. Furthermore, the edited lines \u2013 #1 (Figure\u00a03; H060\u20101), #3 (Figure\u00a03: H060\u20102, H060\u20103) and #5 (Figure\u00a0S9) from construct H060 \u2013 exhibited reduced vigour, stunting and leaf chlorosis. This possibly indicates an unfavourable match of the BeYDV GVR with cassava: pleiotropic effects of the replicase protein in cassava cells, presence of the replicon per se or provocation of a plant defence response may have inhibited regeneration of edited cells. A replicon derived from a cassava mosaic virus species, such as African cassava mosaic virus, may prove more effective for GVR\u2010based editing in cassava. The range of efficiencies observed from our various editing strategies highlights the importance of empirical testing within each system to identify the most effective approach for a particular species and transformation methodology.",
                "Selectable marker\u2010free gene editing studies in wheat (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2016) reported high frequency recovery of plants with targeted mutagenesis that did not contain detectable transgenic DNA. Our glyphosate selection strategy required high\u2010fidelity EPSPS editing to achieve herbicide tolerance, an outcome that could occur with or without concomitant integration of nuclease\u2010encoding T\u2010DNA sequences. A PCR screen for the presence of Cas9 indicated event #2, derived from the H056 vector, lacked detactable integration of the T\u2010DNA (Figure\u00a02), which may suggest transgene\u2010free gene editing. Multiplexed gene editing may be achieved by selecting cells that have been edited for herbicide tolerance and then subsequently screening them for precise gene editing at a nonselectable locus.",
                "To characterize functionality of the 2.3\u2010kb 2x35S TIPA sequence replacement and resulting glyphosate tolerance in regenerated plants, we assessed performance of one event derived from each of the standard T\u2010DNA vectors using the shikimate leaf disc assay (Figures\u00a03a and S10) and foliar herbicide application (Figure\u00a03b,c). The edited plants exhibited tolerance equivalent to the high\u2010performing plant line with the 2x35S\u2010driven TIPA gene model. This demonstrates the suitability of an EPSPS gene editing strategy to precisely introduce robust glyphosate tolerance in plants. As a new breeding tool for creating targeted genetic variation, gene editing enables efficient introduction of designed traits that are similar to what could occur in nature. With this in mind, our next objective is to introduce into the EPSPS allele a TIPA enzyme under control of a cassava strong constitutive promoter (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2017) to generate a robust glyphosate tolerance trait without genomic integration of transgenic sequences.",
                "We have applied precise gene editing to produce glyphosate tolerance in cassava at levels similar to conventional transgenic approaches. We found that direct selection for the EPSPS edit with repair template delivery on a standard T\u2010DNA configured to use only the HR repair pathway resulted in the highest recovery of edited events. One event may be lacking integration of the genome editing tool was indicated by PCR. In addition to the potential value of these specific lines for efficient weed control in cassava production, we anticipate this study will be used as a guide for the application of biotechnology to further improvements in cassava, as well as for the development of robust gene\u2010edited glyphosate traits in other crop species."

                        "A protoplast isolation and transformation protocol (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2012) was adapted for cassava with major alterations as follows: leaves of 6\u00a0weeks old in\u00a0vitro cassava plants of cultivar 60444 or TME 204 were sliced and incubated for 14\u00a0h in enzyme solution (1.0% cellulase R10, 0.25% macerozyme R10, 0.45\u00a0m mannitol, 20\u00a0mm MES, 1\u00d7 Murashige and Skoog salts and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 5.7\u20135.8) while shaking at 20\u00a0rpm. Cells were filtered through a 40\u2010\u03bcm strainer, transferred directly to the top of the sucrose solution and centrifuged without a deceleration brake. Cells were washed twice before quantification and diluted to 106 cells mL\u20101 in MMG solution (0.4\u00a0m mannitol, 15\u00a0mm MgCl2 and 4\u00a0mm MES, pH 5.7). Transformation was performed by mixing 200\u00a0\u03bcL of cells with 40\u00a0\u03bcL DNA before adding 240\u00a0\u03bcL polyethylene glycol transformation buffer (40% PEG, 0.2\u00a0m mannitol, 100\u00a0mm CaCl2) and incubating for 20\u00a0min. All steps were performed with W5 solution (2\u00a0mm MES pH 5.7, 154\u00a0mm NaCl, 125\u00a0mm CaCl2, 5\u00a0mm KCl), except where a different solution is described. Cells were moved to six\u2010well plates and incubated for 48\u00a0h in W5 solution before extracting DNA for analysis. Extractions were performed with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD, USA) by pelleting the cells at max speed and starting at step seven of the manufacturer's protocol.",
