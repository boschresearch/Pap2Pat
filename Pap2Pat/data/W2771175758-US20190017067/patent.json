Since then, agricultural land devoted to biotech crops has continued to increase, reaching a record 181.5 million hectares worldwide in 2014 (International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, \u201cBiotech Crops Show Continued Growth, Benefits in 2014, Global Plantings Increase by 6 Million Hectares,\u201d ISAAA Brief 49-2014: Press Release 28 Jan. 2015).",
                        "The use of glyphosate for chemical weed control in agricultural operations is one of the biggest advances in modern farming. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Its popularity is due largely to favorable properties such as high efficacy, low toxicity to animals, little persistence in the environment, flexible application timing, broad spectrum weed control, and low cost. Its use has increased further with the development of ROUNDUP READY\u00ae and similar traits in major crops."

                        "All glyphosate resistant traits commercialized to date have had to undergo deregulation in the markets in which they are traded. Deregulation presents a substantial barrier in new product development costs and time to market, preventing the development of glyphosate resistance traits in secondary crops. Regulatory approval costs and social acceptance continue to be major worldwide barriers to the development of new genetically modified crops (e.g., crops that carry transgenes such as DNA from a different species).",
                        "This document is based, at least in part, on the discovery that an altered expression profile of a 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene (e.g., an EPSPS gene having a modified coding sequence) in plants can confer glyphosate tolerance. Glyphosate resistant crops enable post-emergence weed control, benefiting farmers with increased flexibility and efficiency. This document also is based, at least in part, on the discovery that gene editing techniques can be used to produce nontransgenic plants having an altered expression profile of one or more EPSPS genes. Nontransgenic strategies, such as gene editing, can be used to produce glyphosate tolerant plants (e.g., in secondary crops and additional plant varieties) with less cost associated with regulatory approval, as well as increased public confidence in the safety of the products.",

                        "In some aspects, this document provides methods for generating a glyphosate tolerant plant. The methods can include site-specific editing of a plant genome in order to modify EPSPS gene regulation, such that a modification to EPSPS gene regulation is effective to cause an altered EPSPS gene expression profile compared to an EPSPS gene expression profile of a non-edited plant genome, and such that the altered EPSPS expression profile confers glyphosate tolerance. The site-specific editing can include operably linking an EPSPS gene to an alternative promoter (e.g., an actin promoter, a ubiquitin promoter, a promoter that drives expression of Manes.17G101400 gene, a promoter that drives expression of Manes.09G138100, or a promoter that drives expression of Manes.11G090400) at a native genomic location of the alternative promoter.

The site-specific editing can include operably linking an EPSPS gene to a recombinant promoter at a native genomic location of the EPSPS gene. A recombinant promoter can be a constitutive promoter and the altered EPSPS gene expression profile can be increased EPSPS expression.

A recombinant promoter can be an inducible promoter (e.g., Es or PR-1). The site-specific editing can include introducing an enhancer (e.g., a 35s enhancer, a translational enhancer from the tobacco etch virus, or a pea PetE enhancer) into an endogenous EPSPS regulatory sequence and the altered EPSPS gene expression profile can be an increase in EPSPS expression. The EPSPS gene can include a modified EPSPS coding sequence. A modified EPSPS coding sequence can include a substitution of the glycine at amino acid 101 (G101), a substitution of the threonine at amino acid 102 (T102), a substitution of the proline at amino acid 106 (P106), a substitution of the glycine at amino acid 144 (G144), a substitution of the alanine at amino acid 192 (A192), or any combination thereof.

Nontransgenic plants and some transgenic plants may achieve nonregulated status under regulatory systems with product-based assessments (e.g., the U.S. regulatory systems). Nontransgenic plants can be made using gene editing strategies as described herein, and can include, for example, site-specific editing of a regulatory sequence and/or a coding sequence, and/or a genomic rearrangement to place a gene under the control of a promoter different from the one by which it is normally controlled.",
                        "The term \u201cglyphosate tolerant\u201d as used herein refers to the ability of a plant to survive and/or grow in the presence of one or more glyphosate-based herbicides without exhibiting death, developmental setback, substantial physiological or physical deterioration, or any symptom of herbicide injury. A glyphosate tolerant plant may also be referred to herein as a glyphosate resistant plant.",

Plant cells include, without limitation, cells from seeds, suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores.",
                        "The glyphosate tolerant plants described herein can be derived from any species of plant that is susceptible to glyphosate. In some cases, a plant can be a monocotyledonous plant. In some cases, a plant can be a dicotyledonous plant.",
                        "In some cases, a glyphosate tolerant plant as described herein can be a crop plant. Crop plants can include, for example, food crops for human consumption, feed crops for livestock consumption, fiber crops for cordage and textiles, oil crops for consumption or industrial uses, energy crops used to make biofuels, and industrial crops. Non-limiting examples of monocotyledonous crops include maize, rice, wheat, barley, sugarcane, oat, rye, millet, sorghum, switchgrass, turfgrass, and bamboo. Non-limiting examples of dicotyledonous crops include bean, soybean, cotton, pea, cowpea, peanut, almond, walnut, apple, plum, peach, pear, citrus, poplar, pine, sugar beet, squash, melon, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, cassava, tomato, pepper, canola, banana, flax, and sunflower. In some cases, a glyphosate tolerant plant having an altered expression profile of an EPSPS gene (e.g., a modified EPSPS gene) described herein can be an ornamental plant. Ornamental plants can include, for example, plants grown for decorative purposes in gardens and landscape design projects, as houseplants, for cut flowers, and for specimen display.",
                        "A glyphosate tolerant plant having an altered expression profile of an EPSPS gene (e.g., a modified EPSPS gene) as described herein can have increased expression levels of the modified EPSPS gene in one or more tissues.",
                        "An altered expression profile of an EPSPS gene can be achieved by modifying a sequence that regulates EPSPS gene expression. In some cases, site-specific gene editing can be used to modify an EPSPS gene regulatory sequence. In some cases, site-specific editing can be used to cause a rearrangement of the plant genome to place an EPSPS gene under the control of an alternative promoter. The one or more modifications to EPSPS gene regulation can be effective to alter the balance of expression (e.g., such that EPSPS is expressed in different tissues of the plant) relative to an unmodified EPSPS gene regulation. The altered expression profile of one or more EPSPS genes can be effective to confer glyphosate tolerance to the plant. Examples of regulatory regions that can be modified or added include, without limitation, promoters, enhancers, suppressors, terminators, 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions, intronic sequences, translation initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, and transcription factor recognition sites. Regulatory regions can be cis- or trans-regulatory regions, and can affect the primary structure, the secondary structure, and/or the stability of the RNA transcript. A promoter can be a constitutive promoter or a regulated promoter. A constitutive promoter may also be referred to as a ubiquitous promoter and can drive transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an EPSPS gene) in most cell types at most times. A regulated promoter may also be referred to as a restricted promoter and can drive transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an EPSPS gene) in response to specific stimuli. A promoter can be a minimal promoter or a composite promoter. A minimal promoter is a promoter having a single genomic promoter fragment derived from a single gene, while a composite promoter is an engineered promoter and can be a synthetic promoter containing a combination of elements from different promoters and/or different origins.",
                        "In some cases, a glyphosate tolerant plant having modified EPSPS gene regulation described herein can include one or more modifications to a native promoter region of an EPSPS gene. For example, a glyphosate tolerant plant described herein can include an EPSPS gene having one or more enhancers introduced in any appropriate location such that expression of the EPSPS gene is increased. An enhancer can be a transcriptional enhancer or a translational enhancer. Non-limiting examples of enhancers include the 35s enhancer, the translational enhancer from the tobacco etch virus, and the pea PetE enhancer. Appropriate locations into which an enhancer can be introduced include, for example, an EPSPS promoter, an EPSPS intron, upstream of an EPSPS promoter, downstream of an EPSPS terminator, and/or at another location that enables cis- or trans-activation of the EPSPS gene expression to confer glyphosate resistance.",
                        "In some cases, a glyphosate tolerant plant having modified EPSPS gene regulation as described herein can include an EPSPS gene that is under the control of an alternative endogenous promoter. An \u201calternative\u201d promoter as used herein is a promoter that is native to the plant being modified, but that does not normally control expression of an EPSPS gene. In some cases, an EPSPS gene can be inserted into a plant genome at the native genomic location of the alternative promoter. Alternatively, a genomic rearrangement can result in an EPSPS gene becoming operably linked to an alternative promoter at the native genomic location of the alternative promoter. An alternative promoter can be a constitutive promoter or a regulated promoter. Non-limiting examples of alternative constitutive promoters that can be used to drive expression of a modified EPSPS gene are actin family promoters, ubiquitin family promoters, and promoters driving expression of housekeeping genes.

Additional alternative promoters that can be used to drive expression of a modified EPSPS gene as described herein can be identified using, for example, tissue-specific RNA-seq experiments as described in Example 7.",
                        "In some cases, a glyphosate tolerant plant having modified EPSPS gene regulation described herein can include a modified EPSPS gene under the control of a recombinant promoter. A \u201crecombinant promoter\u201d as used herein refers to any promoter that does not natively drive expression of an EPSPS gene. For example, a native EPSPS promoter can be replaced by a recombinant promoter at the native genomic location of the endogenous EPSPS gene. The choice of promoters to be included depends upon several factors, including, but not limited to, efficiency, selectability, inducibility, desired expression level, and desired cell or tissue specificity or non-specificity. For example, expressing an EPSPS gene in plant tissues sensitive to glyphosate can be effective to confer glyphosate tolerance to a plant.",

Examples of regulated promoters include, without limitation, cell and/or tissue specific promoters (e.g., promoters that drive transcription predominantly, but not necessarily exclusively, in one cell type or one tissue type), developmentally specific promoters (e.g., promoters that drive transcription based on developmental events), and inducible promoters (e.g., promoters that drive transcription in response to presence of a specific stimulus). It should be understood that some promoters may belong to more than one category of promoter. For example, a promoter that drives transcription in floral meristems can be considered as both a tissue-specific promoter and a developmentally-specific promoter. Non-limiting examples of cell specific and/or tissue specific promoters include promoters that can drive transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an EPSPS gene) in leaf blade, leaf midvein, petiole, stem, lateral bud, shoot apical meristem (SAM), root apical meristem (RAM), immature pollen and other reproductive tissue types, fibrous roots, storage root, friable embryogenic callus (FEC), and/or organized embryogenic structures (OES) of a plant.",

In some cases, an inducible promoter can be responsive to a chemical compound that can be applied to a crop in a field. Examples of regulated promoters that can drive transcription of a modified EPSPS gene in response to specific stimuli include, without limitation, Es (which drives transcription in response to estradiol), and PR-la (which drives transcription in response to salicylic acid, 2,6, dichloroiso-nicotinic acid, and in response to 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester).",

For example, genome editing can be used to produce a glyphosate tolerant plant (e.g., a nontransgenic glyphosate tolerant plant). Genome editing, or genome editing with engineered nucleases (GEEN) inserts, replaces, or removes DNA from a genome using one or more site-specific nucleases (SSN) and, in some cases, a repair template (RT). Nucleases can be targeted to a specific position in the genome, where their action can introduce a particular modification to the endogenous sequences. For example, a SSN can introduce a targeted double-strand break (DSB) in the genome, such that cellular DSB repair mechanisms incorporate a RT into the genome in a configuration that produces heritable glyphosate resistance in the cell, in a plant regenerated from the cell, and in any progeny of the regenerated plant. Nucleases useful for genome editing include, for example, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALE nucleases), CRISPR CRISPR-associated nucleases such as Cas9 or Cpf1, and homing endonucleases (HE; also referred to as meganucleases).",

A RT can be designed to include one or more modifications to an EPSPS regulatory sequence and/or coding sequence of an EPSPS gene as described herein. A RT can include an EPSPS gene or a fragment of an EPSPS gene. In embodiments where a RT includes a fragment of an EPSPS gene, incorporation of the RT into the genome results in an edited genome that can encode an EPSPS polypeptide. In some embodiments, for example, a RT can be designed to include one or more modifications to an EPSPS regulatory sequence as described herein, as well as one or more modifications in the coding sequence of an EPSPS gene, or a fragment thereof, as described herein.",

For example, one or more modifications can be made to an EPSPS gene regulatory sequence and/or to an EPSPS coding sequence without an SSN, by providing a RT that will modify the appropriate chromosomal target without the introduction of a DSB. Alternatively, one or more modifications can be made to an EPSPS gene regulatory sequence and/or to an EPSPS coding sequence without a RT, by introducing one or more SSNs that cut the plant genome in such a way as to cause a rearrangement of the endogenous sequence. Such modification can result in EPSPS gene expression being driven by a different promoter than that which was driving its expression before the modification.",

A small number of lines transformed with the H009, H010, H013, and H014 gene models showed no resistance to glyphosate. However, these lines were not extensively characterized prior to herbicide challenge, so they likely do not contain a functional copy of the EPSPS cassettes, or exhibit low expression of the enzyme.
