                        "S. aureus is a susceptible pathogen that can cause body inflammation and even systemic infection. Spoilage of fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and meat are all potential sources of foodborne illness caused by S. aureus. S. aureus D48 is a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, is a foodborne pathogenic microorganism, and produces toxins that cause food poisoning. S. aureus survives a wide temperature range (7-48\u00b0 C.) and pH (pH 4-10), and tolerates low water activity (aw 0.83-0.86) and very high salt concentration (15-20%). To prevent contamination and reproduction of S. aureus in food, food preservatives are commonly added, but excessive or long-term intake of chemical preservatives is prone to cause accumulation of toxicity and damage to the body. Hence, it is extremely urgent to develop new safe natural biological preservatives against resistant pathogenic microorganisms.",
                        "Lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin is a protein or polypeptide with a bacteriostatic effect produced by lactic acid bacteria, and can be used as a biological preservative for reducing pollution of foodborne pathogens, reducing economic loss caused by food spoilage, and improving the safety of food without changing the quality and flavor of the food. So far, lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin has been rarely developed in the food industry, and only nisin is widely used. Lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin products for inhibiting methicillin-resistant S. aureus have never been used commercially in the food industry. Therefore, it is of great significance to human health and socioeconomics to develop new lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin as a natural food bacteriostatic additive to control S. aureus contamination in food."
