Respiratory coronaviruses are being extensively studied in the research community, due to the high seasonal fatalities globally caused by the common influenza, but the danger of new emergent coronaviruses has become apparent with the current wide-spread nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus, which started a global pandemic in the early half of 2020, has caused more than 2.2 million total Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and infected more than 100 million humans.",
                        "With the large-scale infection of this virus, the use of respiratory face masks (N95, surgical, home-made) has become vital to prevent the continuation of the pandemic, as it has been proven to prevent both the infection of the individual and the virus transmittance from the host via the capture of respiratory droplets. Unfortunately, in non-health care and health care workers, the use of respiratory face masks reduced the rate of infection by a respiratory virus by only about 50% and 80%, respectively, thus showing the immense need for novel technological improvements in the field of mask research and development. The development of smart filtration materials with lower air flow resistance to remove airborne nanoparticles and virus particles will provide immense human health and industrial work-place benefits."

                                "The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a single strand RNA-enveloped \u03b2-coronavirus and is transmittable via close contact with an infected subject, primarily through the emission of hydrated aerosol particles. This virus, with an average size of 29.9 kb (2.99\u00d710\u22126 nm2), contains several primary structural proteins, consisting of the small envelope glycoprotein (E), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike glycoprotein (S) and the membrane glycoprotein (M). The spike glycoprotein (SGP), with a molecular weight of roughly 150 kDa, has become the focus of SARS-CoV-2 research, as it facilitates the infection of the host cells via this transmembrane protein's proteolytic cleavage. After cleavage, the two primary subunits of the SGP facilitate viral host entry by attaching to the ACE2 receptor (S1 subunit) and initiating membrane fusion by uncovering the hydrophobic amino acid side chains for membrane fusion (S2 subunit). Based on this process, it could be hypothesized that the disruption/denaturing of the SGP would lead to the loss of the virus' transmissibility.",
                                "Proteins denaturation is a process that often consists of the unraveling or change in conformation of the protein's secondary and tertiary structure. This process results in the loss of the native protein configuration and functionality, which often exposes the protected hydrophobic regions of the protein as well. There are several methods for protein denaturation, such as heat treatment, urea treatment, acidic or basic pH treatment, and alcohol treatment, that denature mainly via the disruption of the protein's hydrogen or/and disulfide bonds. However, proteins' functionality is very sensitive to the conformation of the protein itself, thus indicating that other milder protein denaturation options could be available to result in protein function loss. Studies have indicated that enzyme treatment could be one such method, as it can possibly denature proteins by causing a small conformation change, such as a minute change in the dihedral angles of the amino acid residues. A serine protease enzyme with high stability, such as Subtilisin Carlsberg (used in laundry detergent industry), could be ideal for process, as the enzyme is stable under non-ideal conditions, the enzyme's functionality is well understood, and substrate-binding modifications are highly studied. Additionally, Subtilisin's flexible enzymatic process has been proven to be independent of the primary structure of the substrate's cleavage site, thus indicating that the enzyme should interact with a wide range of substrates, such as the SGP of SARS-CoV-2.",
                                "The efficacy of respiratory masks has been extensively investigated in recent years, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The N95 mask, which primarily consist of multi-layered non-woven polypropylene (PP), is the most commonly-used mask in the healthcare industry, yet it does not offer consistent prevention of virus transmission. Lee et al. found that only 70% of the 45 tested N95 masks (4 different models) offered greater than 90% rejection of NaCl aerosol particles of coronavirus-like size (40-200 nm), thus showing a large potential danger for virus transmission. Polymeric membranes, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), could be appropriate to mitigate this danger and offer greater aerosol particle capture than N95 masks, due to the ability to precisely control the membrane pore size and structure. PVDF membranes with exact variables (thickness, porosity, pore size) could be developed for appropriate air permeability and pressure drop, as well as consistently high capture of SARS-CoV-2 virus-size particles (60-140 nm). Additionally, further transmission protection could be incorporated via enzyme functionalization of membrane surface and pores. This functionalization process could allow for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 droplets that reach the membrane filter surface via SGP denaturation.",
                                "The enzyme immobilization limit and strength can be further enhanced with the addition of a non-toxic polymer, such as poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) with a pKa of \u02dc5, via surface and pore functionalization. Due to this polymer's negative charge above its pKa for the carboxylic acid groups, PMAA is able to electrostatically attract Subtilisin A enzymes, which are positively charged below their isoelectric point (pI) of 9.4. A similar method has been used in the past to incorporate negatively-charged enzymes into membranes after the addition of positively-charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) into a membrane domain containing carboxylic acid groups. Furthermore, the presence of water has been proven to be necessary for enzyme structure and function, thus functionalization with PMAA, which has the ability to retain water, could enhance the stability and function longevity of the immobilized enzymes.",
                                "This Experimental section relates to the development of a membrane mask and air filter with enhanced aerosol particle capture, as well as the ability to inactivate coronaviruses (specifically, SARS-CoV-2) through enzyme functionalization, greatly reducing both individual transmissibility of the virus and the disease spread. Specific membrane variables (thickness, porosity, pore size) appropriate for mask and air filtration applications were developed and compared to commercially available respiratory masks. The immobilization of various enzymes (Subtilisin, Trypsin) onto PVDF and PMAA-PVDF surfaces was analyzed with different functionalization methods (batch, convective flow). The membrane's enhanced particle filtration and capture (based on particle size) abilities were tested and compared to commercial N95 masks. The denaturation of the SGP of SARS-CoV-2 (wild type) by enzyme-functionalized membranes was tested at low hydration.",

PVDF 400 membranes were weighed before this process. A polymerization solution in deoxygenated water (pH of 5.3-6.5) was then created from methacrylic acid (MAA; monomer), N,N\u2032-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA; crosslinker), and potassium persulfate (KPS; initiator). To limit polymerization before the introduction of the solution into the membrane pores, MAA and MBA were dissolved initially in a separate solution from the initiator; the two solutions were combined prior to being exposed to the membranes. The weight fraction of MAA in the final solution varied from 0.06-0.15 and the amount of MBA and initiator were each equivalent to 1 mol % relative to MAA. Using vacuum filtration, solutions were drawn through the pores of the membrane multiple times through the top of the membrane and a few through the back. As a result, PMAA was polymerized into the walls of the pores where it could subsequently immobilize Subtilisin Carlsberg within the pores. To limit the polymerization on the surface, residual solution was wiped away from the membrane. Membranes were then wrapped in a plastic wrapping, clamped between Teflon plates, and heated under a vacuum (P\u02dc0.6-0.7 bar vacuum) for 1.5-1.7 hours. After this time, the wrapped membranes were removed from between the plates and heated again under vacuum or at atmospheric pressure for \u02dc30 minutes. Lastly, membranes were removed from the plastic wrappings and placed in the oven under vacuum or at atmospheric pressure for 15-30 min. During the time in the oven, membranes were heated to \u02dc80\u00b0-90\u00b0 C. After these reaction steps, membranes were cooled, rinsed with DI water, and dried. A final mass value was recorded to determine the amount of PMAA added to each membrane.",

For commercial masks, air flow rate experiments were conducted in a normal orientation as well, meaning that the side of the mask that would be exposed to the ambient environment was the air inlet side, while the side of the mask that would be exposed to the human's mouth and nose was the air outlet side.

To prevent the quenching interaction of Sypro Orange with hydrophobic segments of Subtilisin, membrane bound subtilisin was used such that SGP could be introduced in a liquid drop onto the surface of the membrane and interact with the enzyme without allowing the Subtilisin to enter the solution. As Subtilisin is held to the membrane with hydrogen bonding (not covalently bound), it is expected that there will be minor diffusion of Subtilisin into a water droplet on the membrane surface. To investigate the denaturation event while controlling for the diffusion of subtilisin into the water droplet, four different samples were made.

These different types of water filtration membranes are utilized for varying purposes, due to their unique flow profiles, transfer mechanisms, and pore size range. Each membrane type has a flow profile that is controlled by its respective membrane properties (porosity, pore diameter, thickness), which were experimentally quantified for the commercial membranes of this research to better understand the fluid/air flow regime through these membranes (Table 1).",
                                "Many water filtration membranes are composed of two layers: a thin selective layer that is utilized for the separation/filtration process and an open support structure with a higher thickness. This design allows for (1) reduction of applied pressure needed for flow and (2) a support layer to reduce the probability of pore structure disruption during high-pressure filtration. The commercial MF membrane, PVDF400, follows this structure and is composed of a PVDF separating layer (thickness\u02dc40 \u03bcm) and a polyester support layer (thickness-125 \u03bcm), which was confirmed with SEM imaging (FIG. 3).",

Mask material should have a relatively high hydrophobicity to allow a high rate of material drying, which is directly correlated to a lower virus transmission rate. The contact angle of blank PVDF400 was relatively high, starting at 86.2\u00b0\u00b10.5\u00b0 (t=2 seconds) and staying over 80\u00b0, indicating hydrophobic behavior (FIG. S1). Upon PMAA functionalization, though, the membrane exhibits a high contact angle initially (72.2\u00b0\u00b13.2\u00b0), but dissipates to 27.6\u00b0\u00b111.8\u00b0 within 38 seconds of drop deposition, indicating that PMAA functionalization introduces hydrophilic behavior into the membrane system.

Due to this membrane structure, the effect of membrane variables (thickness, porosity, pore size) on flow can be predicted more accurately than that of mask materials. Convective flow of an incompressible fluid through a porous membrane, due to a differential pressure driving force, can be expressed by the Hagan Poiseuille equation, applied to a pressure-driven pore flow membrane model:",

The density of air, as a compressible fluid, is affected by different variables, such as temperature, pressure, and relative humidity, which can vary significantly in pressure-drive flow systems. Air flow through porous membranes must take density into account, similarly to Kumar and Lee's momentum balance, thus one can use Ergun-type equations (commonly used for packed bed column pressure drop calculations) could be applied to membrane air permeation situations.",
                                "The creation of a membrane-based air filter is highly dependent on the breathability and air flow through that material and must be comparable to the respective values of commercially-available face masks. To reach these values, the control of certain membrane variables can be utilized to obtain predictable flux changes, such as a change in membrane thickness resulting in a proportionate change in volumetric/mass flow rate through the membrane (Eqn. 1 and 2). To test the permeability control by membrane variables, as well as the validity of the Ergun equation, the linear relationship between membrane permeability and certain variables (thickness, pore radius) were tested experimentally for commercial water filtration membranes. The relationship of thickness was tested by only changing the thickness of PVDF400 membranes (via membrane stacking) while retaining consistent porosity and mean pore size (FIG. 5A), while the relationship of pore size was tested by testing two different commercial PVDF Durapore membranes of varying pore size, but same porosity and thickness (FIG. 5B). The obtained R2 value of 0.9995 and 0.9088 for inverse thickness and pore radius squared, respectively, indicate a strong linear relationship between these variables and air permeability, thus confirming the ability to control the air permeability of water filtration membranes with changes in membrane parameters.",

The relationship (resulting in precise control of air permeability) can be utilized to predict the air flow through almost any porous membrane material with the availability of accurate values for porosity, pore radius, and thickness. The tortuosity of membranes will have an effect on the air permeability, but, due to the complexity of obtaining values for tortuosity, its effect will not be considered.

Based on a linear relationship between air permeability (kg/m2/hour) and a correlation factor for membrane variables (porosity, pore radius, thickness), the Isopore membrane was estimated to have an air permeability of 1921 kg/m2/hour. This, compared to the experimental Isopore permeability of 2206\u00b145 kg/m2/hour, indicates that the air permeability of a porous water filtration membrane can be accurately estimated using membrane variable of porosity, pore radius, and membrane thickness.",

Similar trends were observed in the dry air flux to that of the water flux, such as MF membranes having the highest permeability and a linear correlation between applied pressure and air flux, thus indicating that these water filtration membranes could be appropriate for transition from water to air flow and aerosol capture applications.",

The dry air permeability of this MF membrane, along with only the polyester support, was experimentally compared to commercial respiratory facemasks (surgical mask, N95) (FIG. 8). These experiments were done with dry air and it was proven that the change of air permeability of PVDF membranes using air of different RH values was proven to be negligible (within standard deviation) (FIG. 19).

Using previously-determined relationships (FIG. 5 & FIG. 6) and membrane variables from existing commercial membranes (Table S1), mathematical modelling was conducted in order to determine values for the membrane variables of a PVDF membrane that can match the air flux of commercial N95 masks at the average human breathing pressure of 0.08 bar. Two different membrane designs are proposed: one with no pore size change (optimal for SARS-CoV-2 virus capture) and one including pore size change (Table 2).

The mechanism that occurs can vary greatly, as it is affected by the size of particle, type/composition of material, and, in the instances of membranes, which pore the particle is entering through. For respiratory face masks, aerosol filtration and capture are crucial for the protection of the wearer and has been highly research in recent years. For such testing, aerosolized polystyrene latex (PSL) and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles are commonly used.",

Prior to enzyme testing, PSL particles with a size similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (diameter-100 nm) were utilized to test the aerosol filtration efficiency of the membrane material. More specifically, the permeate size distribution of aerosolized PSL particles through PMAA-PVDF membranes were experimentally determined and compared to commercial N95 and surgical masks (FIG. 9). PMAA-PVDF membranes in normal orientation were observed to have a significantly lower particle size distribution than that of commercial N95 and surgical masks, while the same membrane in reverse orientation was observed to have similar permeate particle size distributions as that of N95 masks. This indicates that PMAA-PVDF membranes could offer greater protection to the individual from coronavirus (ex. SARS-CoV-2) particles than N95 and surgical masks, due to its more selective filtration in regard to particle size. The commercial surgical mask displayed a permeate particle size distribution similar to that of the feed, indicating that surgical masks offer little to no protection from SARS-CoV-2 particles, which has been observed in other studies. Material surface and cross-section characterization was conducted before and after aerosol testing using SEM (FIG. 20).",
                                "The SARS-CoV-2 virus particle has several surface proteins, which could negatively affect the filtration efficiency and mask performance by giving the particles a \u201csticky\u201d nature, thus fouling the membrane more easily. The permeate particle count of PSL particles with COOH groups was experimentally determined through a PVDF400 membrane and compared to the particle count of PSL particles functionalized with GFP (His-Tag attachment) (FIG. 10A). It was found that, even after processing approximately 150,000 100-nm PSL-COOH particles/L for 50 minutes, the permeate air was detected to contain virtually no 100 nm particles (less than 10). The particle counter is limited in that the lowest reported size is 300 nm particles, but the feed readings (150,000 100-nm particles/L) indicate that this level of measurement can be utilized to compare 100-nm particle concentrations. There was no statistically significant difference found between permeate particle count between PSL-COOH and PSL-GFP particles, indicating that, at these conditions, surface proteins do not negatively affect particle filtration efficiency (count-based) of PVDF-based filters or simply that there are not enough surface proteins to see an effect. The air flux of the membrane over time of processing aerosolized PSL-COOH and PSL-GFP particles was also investigated (FIG. 10B). The air flux drop of membranes that treated PSL-COOH particle air was found to be slightly greater than that of PSL-GFP-treated membranes. Both findings are strong indications that PVDF membranes can be utilized for respiratory face masks and closed-environment air filters for high-efficiency treatment of air with large concentrations of virus-based aerosol contaminants. Particles captured by the surface of the membrane were characterized by SEM (FIGS. 21-A and 21-B).",
                                "In realistic scenarios, the feed air will not contain PSL particles of similar size, but more complex particles of varying sizes and shape. To test the membrane's longevity of use as an aerosol filter material, an ambient air testing module with controlled air flow rate was utilized (FIG. 11-A). Using the critical flow controller with no breathing pattern, the flow rate though PMAA-PVDF and N95 material was set to an average breathing flow rate of humans (calculated from literature) and was monitored over time when passing ambient air using a vacuum pump (FIG. 11-B). Severe fouling of the N95 mask was observed with a 33.7% decrease in flow rate after 1273 L of ambient air filtration, while the PMAA-PVDF membrane showed minimal drop at normal and reverse orientation with 6.3% and 0.4% decrease in flow rate for normal and reverse orientation, respectively, after about 1200 L of ambient air filtration. This information can be utilized to estimate the longevity of use in a mask application with exhalation valve (inlet flow only). With an average breathing rate of 18 breaths/min, a 70-kg individual with an average tidal volume of 500 mL per breath could wear a PMAA-PVDF mask for multiple days (2 hours of daily use) without showing a significant drop in mask breathability, while the N95 mask could become difficult to use after a single day of use. This indicates that PMAA-PVDF masks could be used for longer periods before disposal, thus helping combat higher levels of plastic pollution that is present during periods of increased PPE usage. This equipment's critical flow controller can run for precise sinusoidal-like time frames to mimic inhalation breathing patterns, which was utilized to measure material air flux drop over time and compare to continuous flow mode (FIG. 11-C). PMAA-PVDF membranes displayed a slight flow rate drop during sinusoidal on/off cycles (30 second intervals), similar to continuous flow, while the separating layer of the N95 mask displayed a significantly lower flow drop during on/off cycles than that of continuous flow mode. Ambient particle fouling of membrane and mask material was characterized using SEM (FIG. 22).",

Spherical particles, such as the PSL particles, can pack in different orientations, such as hexagonal lattice or face-centered cubic (FCC). The void fraction of PVDF400 and PMAA-PVDF400 membranes were determined experimentally (Table S2, Eqn.

In a solution phase reaction, the KM and Vmax values for this enzyme was determined to be 0.186 mM and 0.0362 mM/min, respectively, which agrees with literature sources.",
                                "Enzymatic functionalization of membranes has been commonly researched, both with site-directed and random enzyme immobilization. PMAA has the capabilities to enhance this process, as it introduces a charge interaction between the system (membrane) and the enzyme during functionalization. PMAA has a deprotonated carboxylic acid group at a pH above its pKa value of 4.8 and Subtilisin A has an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.4 (provided by Sigma Aldrich), which allows PMAA to attract Subtilisin A via electrostatic interactions in a solution of 4.8<pH<9.4. PVDF400 membranes were first functionalized with PMAA, resulting in 1.5-3% weight gain functionalization of the total membrane. The resulting PMAA-PVDF membranes were further functionalized with Subtilisin A in a batch and convective immobilization method (FIG. 12). The presence of PMAA in batch and convective immobilization mode yielded 84% and 125% more enzymes immobilized, respectively, than unfunctionalized PVDF400 membranes (by mass). This confirms that PMAA can enhance the enzymatic load immobilized on the membrane, which can allow for membrane masks and filters to treat higher concentrations of virus-contaminated air more effectively. PMAA and Subtilisin A functionalization was confirmed using FTIR (FIG. 23).",
                                "The stability of functionalized enzymes is vital to the long-term performance of the membrane system, especially with only random immobilization, which can be less stable than site-specific immobilization. To desorb any non-stable enzyme molecules in the system, convective water filtration through Subtilisin-PMAA-PVDF membranes was utilized. About 0-10% of Subtilisin A was observed to desorb from the functionalized membrane system for batch mode. This indicates that the majority of enzymes functionalized on the membrane system are stable and will not further desorb via membrane usage.",
                                "For the development of a mask or filter material, any functionalization, ideally, would not significantly affect the permeability of the material, as this can decrease how fast the material can treat a certain volume, negatively affect the breathability of a mask, and increase the costs associated with the generation of applied pressure for flow through the material. The effect of PMAA and Subtilisin functionalization on the air permeability of PVDF400 membranes were investigated upon surface/pore functionalization (FIG. 13). The amount of PMAA and enzyme functionalized can affect the drop in membrane permeability, but, in most cases, PMAA functionalization decreased the air permeability by roughly 13.41% on average. The enzyme immobilization in convective mode decreased the air permeability of the PMAA-PVDF membrane by about 8.82%, while the batch mode immobilization showed a more severe decrease of 29.73%. This shows that there is a minor permeability drop with PMAA and enzyme functionalization, and that convective immobilization may be optimal for reduction of permeability drop. The effect of this minor permeability drop, though, could be mitigated with fabrication of PVDF membrane with specific variables for higher air flow than PVDF400, as previously mentioned.",

As previously mentioned, the SGP of the SARS-CoV-2 facilities host cell infection, thus the denaturation of this protein would most likely render the virus inactive. DSC has been used to detect protein denaturation in previous studies, as the energy involved in the denaturation process is measured and displayed as a peak in the equipment's generated thermographs. DSC was utilized in this research to determine if Subtilisin A is appropriate to denature the SGP by comparing the thermograph of SGP and Subtilisin to that of native SGP and thermally-denatured SGP (FIG. 14). A known protein, BSA, was utilized as a standard to ensure proper DSC usage and results that match with previous literature reports. The native SGP thermograph displayed a distinct peak at approximately 40\u00b0 C., indicating that SGP is denatured in an environment of that temperature. The heat-treated SGP displayed no thermograph peak, indicating that the heat treatment already denatured the protein prior to DSC analysis. The enzyme-treated SGP showed no peak, similar to the heat-treatment signal, thus indicating that Subtilisin A denatured SGP similarly to high temperature-treatment, proving Subtilisin has the ability to denature native SGP.",
                                "Upon denaturation, the cleavage and/or unraveling of the protein has been proven to expose the hydrophobic domains that would otherwise be protected on the inside of the native protein. Sypro Orange, a hydrophobic-binding fluorescent dye, has been proven for protein denaturation studies, and was investigated to determine if the fluorescent intensity change was significant to identify SGP denaturation. After SGP thermal denaturation (70\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes), the Sypro Orange compound showed a 25% increase in fluorescent intensity, showing RFU of 333 and 417 with standard deviations of 32 and 26 for native and thermally denatured, respectively. This increase in fluorescent intensity indicates that the hydrophobic regions of the SGP were exposed to Sypro Orange via heat denaturation and can be identified utilizing this compound.",

An increase in fluorescent intensity of SGP with the presence of membrane-immobilized enzyme (compared to SGP with no enzyme presence) was observed, showing that Subt-PMAA-PVDF400 membranes can denature SGP with minimal hydration. This indicates that the immobilized enzymes in the membrane system will maintain SGP denaturation activity in low-humidity respiratory face mask or indoor filter applications.",

Prior to measurements, membranes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in a convection oven. Dried samples were taped onto glass slides and placed into a DSA 100 (KR\u00dcSS Scientific Instruments, Inc.). The sessile-drop method was selected for contact angle measurements. This method was carried out by manually drawing and dosing a 3 \u03bcL DI water droplet (pH\u02dc6) and using the instrument to deposit the drop onto the membrane surface. Data collection was started (time=0) immediately after the deposition of the drop. Data were collected every 2 seconds for up to 84 seconds following the drop deposition. Three runs were done for each type of membrane. Drops with contact angles above 20\u00b0 were fitted using the Young Laplace method while drops with contact angles below 20\u00b0 were fitted as circles. These contact angles are shown over time in FIG. 18.",
                                "The average contact angle of PVDF 400 stayed nearly constant, only dropping from 86.2\u00b0\u00b10.5\u00b0 at a time of 2 seconds to 84.0\u00b0\u00b10.5\u00b0 at 38 seconds. In contrast, the average contact angle of the PMAA-PVDF membrane samples sharply decreased from 72.2\u00b0\u00b13.2\u00b0 to 27.6\u00b0\u00b111.8\u00b0 over the same time span. This decrease is due to the intake of water from the PMAA hydrogel present in the membrane. The ability of the PVDF-PMAA membranes to soak in water could potentially translate to enhanced enzyme performance under air conditions where humidity is present. Further work could be pursued to determine the ability of these functionalized membranes to retain water from humid air.",

The air permeability of water-filtration PVDF400 membranes were compared to commercial N95 and surgical masks, and theoretical modelling of a PVDF membrane (by varying porosity, pore size, and thickness) proved that this material can be fabricated into a membrane of comparable air permeability to that of commercial masks. The air permeability of a commercial Isopore MF water-filtration membrane was accurately estimated, based on its porosity, thickness, and pore size, as well as air permeability data of other water-filtration MF membranes.",

PVDF400 membranes were determined to offer extremely high particle capture and rejection of both PSL-COOH and PSL-GFP particles (permeate-8 PSL-GFP particles/L compared to the feed concentration of 37,175 particles/L after 50 minutes of filtration), indicating that this is a suitable material for mask and air filter. PVDF400 membranes were successfully functionalized with PMAA (1.5-3% weight gain after polymerization) to increase the enzyme functionalization capacity of the membrane system. The average permeate aerosol size of unfunctionalized nano-sized PSL particles through PMAA-PVDF membranes was significantly smaller than that of N95 and surgical masks, indicating that PMAA-PVDF membranes can offer better protection from coronavirus aerosolized particles than commercial respiratory face masks.",

In sinusoidal flow mode, PMAA-PV and N95's separating layer displayed similar minute decreases of air flow after 10 minutes of ambient air filtration. This result indicates that PMAA-PVDF membranes could possibly last longer than commercial N95 masks before needing to be replaced, but further testing (inlet-forward and outlet-backwards flow cycles) should be done.",
