                        "Influenza A virus still is a major cause of disease in humans, accounting for three to five million cases of severe illness and 250,000-500,000 deaths each year. Efficient influenza A vaccines are available, which act by inducing neutralizing antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA). Since HA undergoes continuous change due to mutations (antigenic drift), new antigenic variants of influenza A arise every year requiring constant update of the vaccines. Effective vaccination is further complicated by the occasional re-assortment of the segmented viral genome leading to the replacement of HA or neuraminidase (NA) from one subtype by another subtype, a process called antigenic shift. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HA is very efficient, however, suffers the same disadvantages as the current vaccines due to antigenic shift and drift.",
                        "An ideal target for active and passive immunization strategies would therefore be a conserved viral protein. The matrix protein 2 (M2) fits the bill and has received considerable attention as a potential target against influenza infection over the past decades (Zebedee S L, Lamb R A: Influenza A virus M2 protein: monoclonal antibody restriction of virus growth and detection of M2 in virions. J Virol 1988, 62:2762-2772). M2 is a tetrameric ion channel which is involved in virus uncoating in the endosome and in virus maturation in the trans-Golgi network. Its 23 amino acid extracellular domain has remained remarkably conserved in human influenza A virus isolates over the last hundred years, at least in part due to the fact that the M2 protein is co-transcribed with the matrix protein 1 (M1). Whereas M2 is abundantly expressed on infected cells, only very few M2 molecules are present in Influenza A virus membranes. In accordance with these observations M2 specific antibodies were shown to protect by the elimination of infected cells by ADCC rather than by preventing infection through neutralization of the virus (Jegerlehner A, Schmitz N, Storni T, Bachmann M F: Influenza A vaccine based on the extracellular domain of M2: weak protection mediated via antibody-dependent NK cell activity. J. Immunol. 2004, 172:5598-5605).",
                        "Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies has several advantages over vaccination. In particular, it allows treating people which poorly respond to vaccines, such as the elderly, young children or immune compromised individuals. In addition, passive immunization is the treatment option of choice in situations where rapid protection is crucial, such as for post-exposure treatment or prophylaxis for the acutely exposed. A number of M2 ectodomain (M2e)-specific mAbs have been reported to protect mice from a lethal challenge in a prophylactic setting. While these mAbs include fully human antibodies derived from transchromosomic mice (Wang R et al., Antiviral Res. 2008, 80:168-177; WO2006/061723A2; and WO03/078600A2), no natural human M2e-specific antibodies have been reported to date. However, for application in human subjects, natural human antibodies are the preferred choice. In contrast to humanized and fully human antibodies derived from phage display or transchromosomic mice, natural human antibodies combine the advantage of minimal immunogenicity with the smallest possible off-target reactivity and toxicity. Furthermore, human derived antibodies have the advantage of having gone through the affinity maturation process, resulting in high affinity antibodies."

                        "A library-based screening led to the identification, isolation and cloning of 53 human scFv which showed high affinity to the extracellular domain of the influenza A M2 protein. Fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies have been generated from representative scFv clones. Human, and in particular fully human antibodies, are advantageous because they show less severe side effects when administered to a human subject. Without being bound to any theory this is because human, and in particular fully human, antibodies are typically and preferably not recognized by the human immune system. It has surprisingly been found that the selected antibody clones show different combinations of identical and/or highly similar CDR sequences in their light chain variable regions (LCVR) and in their heavy chain variable regions (HCVR). Based on the particular combination of CDRs, different types of LCVRs and HCVRs can be distinguished (cf. Tables 1 and 2). However, the LCVRs and HCVRs of all clones are highly similar as can be deduced from the sequence information which is provided in Tables 1 and 2. It was therefore concluded that the antibodies of the invention are clonally related. Table 3 provides an overview of the different combinations of LCVR and HCVR types as defined by their CDRs which were found in the selected clones. The table also indicates the abundance of each of these combinations among the 53 clones. Further surprisingly it has been found that the antibodies of the invention show a very high affinity towards influenza M2e antigen, and in particular towards the extracellular domain of the influenza A M2 protein. The dissociation constants (Kd) between the antibodies and RNAse-influenza A M2e antigen conjugate was found to be in the low picomolar range. An epitope mapping revealed that the minimal epitope which is recognized by antibody clone D005 is comprised in the amino acid sequence LLTEVETP (SEQ ID NO:93). This epitope is comprised by the M2 protein of most known influenza A strains. Consequently, it has been found, that the antibodies of the invention show a similarly high affinity to different variants of the extracellular domain of influenza A M2 protein which are derived from different strains of influenza A virus. It has also been demonstrated that the antibodies of the invention are specifically binding to cells which are expressing recombinant influenza A M2 protein on their surface. Moreover, antibodies of the invention were found to exhibit a preferential binding to cell-associated influenza A M2 protein. Furthermore it was found that antibodies of the invention are capable of specifically binding influenza A M2 protein in the context of influenza A virus particles. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated in a mouse model for influenza A virus infection that the antibodies of the invention are highly effective in the treatment and/or prevention of influenza A virus infection. Contrary to other influenza A M2 specific human antibodies which are known in the art, the antibodies of the invention have therapeutic activity when administered as a single dose on day one or day two after infection. The antibodies disclosed herein are therefore useful as a medicament against influenza A virus infection in a therapeutic as well as in a prophylactic setting.",

Thus, ELISA plates were coated with M2e conjugated to RNAse A at a concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), over night at 4\u00b0 C. The plates were then washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween) and blocked for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 3% BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with purified scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c and scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c at a concentration of 100 ng/ml in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of M2e, an M2 extracellular domain peptide derived from H5N1 Influenza A VN1203 (M2e-VN; SEQ ID NO:50), or a shortened M2e peptide (M2e-short; SEQ ID NO:49) (Table 7). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then extensively washed with wash buffer. Bound scFv-Fc fusion proteins were then detected by a 1 h incubation with a HRPO-labeled, Fc\u03b3-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 115-035-071). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed with OPD solution and read on an ELISA reader as described above. Binding of each of the antibodies to immobilized M2e was inhibited by all three peptides to a similar extent, indicating that all three peptides were recognized equally well (Table 6)."

This model reflects most of the immunological and histological aspects of Influenza infection in humans and is therefore routinely used to assess the efficacy of anti-viral agents. Thus, six week old female C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 \u03bcg of scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c or mouse IgG in PBS (6 mice per group). One day later, mice were bled in order to verify the presence of the antibodies in the blood by ELISA. Antibodies were readily detectable in the sera of all mice, except for one mouse receiving clone D005, which was subsequently removed from the analysis (not shown). Another day later (day 0), mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted Influenza A virus PR8 (4\u00d7LD50) followed by monitoring of weight-loss and fever (temperature drop) for 12 days. Control mice treated with mouse IgG developed severe signs of morbidity, characterized by dramatic temperature drop and weight loss, within 5 to 6 days and invariably died on days 7 or 8 (FIG. 3C). In contrast, animals treated with M2-specific antibodies were almost completely protected from any signs of morbidity, developed hardly any signs of fever and lost weight only temporarily (FIG. 3A and B).",
                                "To determine the minimal amount of antibody required to achieve full protection of mice in a prophylactic setting, scFv-msFc-\u03b32c D005 was titrated. To this end, six week old female C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with decreasing amounts of the antibody (200, 60, 20, or 6 \u03bcg per mouse) or, as a control, with 200 \u03bcg of mouse IgG (6 mice per group). One day later, mice were bled in order to verify the presence of the antibodies in the blood by ELISA. Antibodies were readily detectable in the sera of all mice, except for one mouse receiving the 60 \u03bcg dose, which was subsequently removed from the analysis (not shown). Another day later (day 0), animals were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of influenza A virus strain PR/8/34 (4\u00d7LD50) and monitored for 21 days (FIG. 4A). As expected, control mice quickly succumbed to the disease and were dead in less than two weeks. In contrast, antibody D005 showed protective activity at all doses tested. In groups of mice receiving 200, 60 or 20 \u03bcg antibody, all animals survived the lethal challenge. Even at the lowest dose of 6 \u03bcg D005, half of the mice recovered and survived infection, indicating that the M2-specific antibody is a potent prophylactic agent."

On the other hand, the involvement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was investigated, by using a scFv-D005 antibody fused to a mutated human Fc\u03b3l incapable of binding to Fc receptors (scFv-D005-hFcm).

Thus, Fc receptor interaction is required for protection, suggesting that ADCC is a major component of the prophylactic activity.",

                                "The dissociation constants (Kd) of antibody binding to M2e in solution were determined using an ELISA-based method essentially as described (Friguet B. et al., 1985, J. Immunol. Meth. 77, 305-319). Briefly, a 10 ng/ml solution of, respectively, scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c or scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c, was incubated in the presence of different concentrations of RNAse conjugated to influenza A M2e (SEQ ID NO:48) (3-fold serial dilutions ranging from 10 nM to 0.17 with respect to the content of influenza A M2e) in PBS/1% BSA. After 2 h at room temperature, free antibody was detected by a classical ELISA similar to the one described in Example 4. For this, ELISA plates that had been coated with RNAse-M2e conjugate at a concentration of 20 ng/ml at 4\u00b0 C. overnight were washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween) and blocked for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 3% BSA in wash buffer. The plates were then washed again and incubated with the solution binding reactions for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive washing with wash buffer, bound scFv-Fc\u03b32c fusion proteins were detected by a 1 h incubation at room temperature with a HRPO-labeled, Fc\u03b3-specific, goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 115-035-071). After extensive washing with wash buffer, plates were developed with OPD solution (1 OPD tablet, 25 ml OPD buffer and 8 \u03bcl 30% H2O2) for 15 min and the reaction was stopped with 5% H2SO4 solution. Plates were then read at OD 450 nm on an ELISA reader (Biorad Benchmark). The Kd values were determined as the EC50 of the ELISA signal as a function of the RNAse-M2e concentration present in the solution binding reaction. The antibodies scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c and scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c were found to bind soluble RNase-M2e with a high affinity. Kd values were found to be 4 pM (D005), 13 pM (E040) and 6 pM (F052).",
                                "The same assay was repeated under otherwise identical conditions using free M2e peptide (SEQ ID NO:48) instead of the RNAse-M2e conjugate. The antibodies scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c and scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c were found to bind soluble M2e peptide with a high affinity. Kd values were found to be 4 nM (D005, E040) and 5 nM (F052).",

                                "The ability of antibody D005 to distinguish between native, cell-associated M2 and an unstructured, soluble M2e peptide was assessed by flow cytometry. For comparison, mouse monoclonal antibody 14C2 was also analyzed (Zebedee et al., 1988, J. Virol. 62(8): 2762-2772). Thus, scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c and mAb 14C2 were incubated in FACS buffer at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/m1 in the presence or absence of 12 nM soluble M2e peptide for 1 hour on ice. The prebound antibodies were then used for staining of L929-M2#E9 cells. Thus, L929-M2#E9 cells were brought to a single-cell suspension and incubated with the prebound antibodies or, as a control, with FACS buffer. After a 50 min incubation on ice, cells were washed in FACS buffer and bound antibodies detected by a 20 min incubation on ice with Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immuno, Cat No 115-176-071) in FACS buffer. After a final wash, the fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur\u00ae (Becton Dickinson) (FIG. 6). Both antibodies were found to bind native, cell surface-expressed M2 with similar efficiency in the absence of peptide. However, in the presence of peptide, mouse mAb 14C2 did not efficiently recognize L292/M2#E9 cells. In contrast, antibody scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c efficiently stained the cells despite the presence of an excess of competing peptide. This indicates that antibody D005, but not mAb 14C2, may bind a conformational epitope only present in native, cell-surface M2.",

Thus, wells of an ELISA plate were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with HA-specific mouse mAb H37-80 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/m1 in coating buffer. The plate was then washed with wash buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween) and blocked for 3 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% BSA in wash buffer. The plate was then washed again and incubated with 108, 5\u00d7107, 2.5\u00d7107, or 1.25\u00d7107 pfu Influenza A PR8 per well in wash buffer/1% BSA. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed again and incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml fully-human IgG1k-D005 or an isotype-matched control antibody (human IgG1k, Sigma, Cat. No. 15154) in wash buffer/1% BSA. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed again and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of HRPO-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immuno, Cat No 109-035-098) in wash buffer/1% BSA. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed extensively with wash buffer, developed with OPD solution and read on an ELISA reader as described above. Whereas no detectable ELISA signal was obtained with the control antibody, hIgG1k-D005 readily detected captured Influenza A particles in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 7).",

                                "Crossreactivity of antibody D005 with M2 sequences derived from different Influenza A strains was analyzed by testing the binding of IgG1k-D005 to solid phase bound peptide variants (analysis performed by Pepscan Presto BV, Lelystad, the Netherlands). Since it was previously found that the epitope recognized by D005 is comprised within the 16 amino acid peptide M2e-short (SEQ ID NO:49) (Example 4), only peptides spanning this region were synthesized. In doing so, 35 of the 23-mer peptides listed in Table 4 (SEQ IDs NO:48, 50-59, 61-83, and 90-92) were covered by 28 different 16-mer peptides. Binding was assayed at two antibody concentrations, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml and 0.05 \u03bcg/ml, revealing that antibody D005 is broadly cross-reactive. Significantly, all peptides tested were recognized, and 19 of the peptides were recognized as well as the one corresponding to the M2e consensus sequence (FIG. 8A).",
                                "The minimal epitope was determined in a similar manner, by testing the binding of IgG1k-D005 to solid phase bound variants of a peptide corresponding to peptide M2e-short (SEQ ID NO:49) (analysis performed by Pepscan Presto BV, Lelystad, the Netherlands). Three types of analyses were done: first, N- and C-terminal deletions; second, epitope scanning by synthesizing all 105 different 3 to 16 mer variants; and third, point mutations by synthesiszing all 304 possible single positional variants. The 3 analyses yielded comparable results (FIG. 8B). N-/C-terminal deletion and epitope scanning analyses narrowed down the region recognized by D005 to the 8-mer peptide LLTEVETP."
