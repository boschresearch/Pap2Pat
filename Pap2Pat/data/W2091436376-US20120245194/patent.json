                        "\u03b14 integrins are prominent on mononuclear leukocytes. They mediate cell migration, which is dependent on binding of the intracellular adaptor protein paxillin to the cytoplasmic tail of \u03b14.",
                        "\u03b14 integrin antagonists are effective in inhibiting a wide variety of experimental models of inflammatory diseases(1-4) and autoimmunity because they inhibit the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes to sites of inflammation. Furthermore, anti-\u03b14 antibodies are of proven therapeutic effectiveness in human autoimmune diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis(5). Anti-\u03b14 antibodies, such as natalizumab, and small molecule and peptidomimetic \u03b14 antagonists inhibit the integrin's interactions with ligands such as VCAM-1. At saturation, this form of inhibition causes complete loss of \u03b14 integrin function. Consequently, use of these agents recapitulates the null phenotype implying the potential for mechanism-based toxicities such as defects in placentation, heart development, and hematopoiesis(6). Furthermore, the blockade of T cell entry into the central nervous system accounts for the occurrence of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in humans treated with anti-\u03b14 integrin antibodies(7).",
                        "Integrin functions depend on their capacity to generate and respond to cellular signals. Blockade of integrin signaling can leave ligand binding function intact(8-10). Consequently, only partial inhibition of function may occur, even with full blockade of the target, potentially providing a more favorable therapeutic window. A quest for interactions important in \u03b14 integrin signaling uncovered a tight binding interaction of the \u03b14 cytoplasmic domain with paxillin, a signaling adaptor (11). Blocking the interaction by mutations of \u03b14 (e.g. \u03b14(Y991A)) that selectively block paxillin binding, reduces cell migration(10;11).",
                        "Furthermore, inhibition of paxillin binding to \u03b14 by a fragment of paxillin(12) or a small molecule antagonist(13) also impairs migration, suggesting that such agents could be used as therapeutic inhibitors of \u03b14 integrin function. Notably, blocking the interaction of \u03b14 with paxillin does not disrupt \u03b14-mediated static adhesion(8;11), suggesting that this form of antagonism might not interfere with functions such as anchorage of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Present inventors have previously confirmed this idea by generating mice homozygous for an \u03b14 mutation (\u03b14(Y991A)) that selectively(11) blocks paxillin binding. Similarly, inventors have previously reported that unlike \u03b14 null mice(6;14), these \u03b14(Y991A) mice are viable and fertile; however, they manifest a profound deficit in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to an inflammatory site with no defect in neutrophil recruitment(29). Furthermore, \u03b14 integrins are essential for definitive hematopoiesis(6;15;16); however, the \u03b14(Y991A) mice exhibited normal hemograms, normal abundance of hematopoietic precursors and unimpaired homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow, a surrogate marker of stem cell migration. Thus inventors have previously established the principle that blockade of \u03b14 integrin signaling can impair mononuclear leukocyte recruitment to an inflammatory site, while averting the adverse effects of \u03b14 integrin loss on development and hematopoiesis (29).",
                        "While existing antagonists of the \u03b14 integrin are useful as therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases, they are also associated with a number of serious toxic side effects. Specifically, known antagonists of the \u03b14 integrin can affect development and hematopoiesis, and are also associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.",
                        "The present invention describes novel compounds that are able to inhibit the interaction of paxillin or its paralogues with \u03b14 integrin or its binding partners that regulate signaling events downstream of the paxillin-\u03b14 interaction and methods for therapeutic use of such compounds. The compounds of the present invention are able to inhibit the interaction of paxillin or its paralogues with \u03b14 integrin or its binding partners without resulting in hematopoietic or developmental toxicities."

DNA backbone analogues provided by the invention include phosphodiester, phosphorothioate; phosphorodithioate, methylphosphonate, phosphoramidate, alkyl phosphotriester, sulfamate, 3\u2032-thioacetal, methylene(methylimino), 3\u2032-N-carbamate; morpholino carbamate, and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs); see Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, edited by F.

Chem. 36:1923-1937; Antisense Research and Applications (1993, CRC Press). PNAs contain non-ionic backbones, such as N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units. Phosphorothioate linkages are described; e.g., by U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,031,092; 6,001,982; 5,684,148; see also, WO 97/03211; WO 96/39154; Mata (1997) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 144:189-197.

No. 5,962,674; Strauss-Soukup (1997) Biochemistry 36:8692-8698), and benzylphosphonate linkages (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,532,226; Samstag (1996) Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev 6:153-156). Such analogues can be employed in the preparation and use of antisense nucleic acids as is well known in the art, such as for the purpose of inhibiting transcription. Additionally, the recitation of a nucleic acid sequence includes its complement unless the complement is specifically excluded or the context makes it clear that only one strand of the nucleic acid sequence is intended to be utilized. Additionally, the recitation of a nucleic acid sequence includes DNA, RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrids unless the context makes it clear that only one specific form of the nucleic acid sequence is intended to be utilized.",
                        "As used herein, the amino acids, which occur in the various amino acid sequences appearing herein, are identified according to their well-known, three-letter or one-letter abbreviations. The nucleotides, which occur in the various DNA fragments, are designated with the standard single-letter designations used routinely in the art.",
                        "In a peptide or protein, suitable conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the bioiogical activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essentiial regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g. J. D. Watson et al,. \u201cMolecular Biology of the Gene\u201d (4th Edition, 1987, Bejamin/Cummings, Palo Alto), p. 224). Specifically, in particular, the conservative amino acid substitutions can be any of the following: (1) any of isoleucine for leucine or valine, leucine for isoleucine, and valine for leucine or isoleucine; (2) aspartic acid for glutamic acid and glutamic acid for aspartic acid; (3) glutamine for asparagine and asparagine for glutamine; and (4) serine for threonine and threonine for serine. Other substitutions can also be considered conservative, depending upon the environment of the particular amino acid. For example, glycine (G) and alanine (A) can frequently be interchangeable, as can be alanine arid valine (V). Methionine (M), which is relatively hydrophobic, can frequently be interchanged with leucine and isoleucine, and sometimes with valine. Lysine (K) and arginine (R) are frequently interchangeable in locations in which the significant feature of the amino acid residue is its charge and the different pK's of these two amino acid residues or their different sizes are not significant. Still other changes can be considered \u201cconservative\u201d in particular environments. For example, if an amino acid on the surface of a protein is not involved in a hydrogen bond or salt bridge interaction with another molecule; such as another protein subunit or a ligand bound by the protein, negatively charged amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid can be substituted for by positively charged amino acids such as lysine or arginine and vice versa. Histidine (H), which is more weakly basic than arginine or lysine, and is partially charged at neutral pH, can sometimes be substituted for these more basic amino acids. Additionally, the amides glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) can sometimes be substituted for their carboxylic acid homologues, glutamic acid and aspartic acid.",
                        "As used herein, \u201cexpression vector\u201d refers to a plasmid, virus or other vehicle known in the art that has been manipulated by insertion or incorporation of heterologous DNA, such as nucleic acid encoding the fusion proteins herein or expression cassettes provided herein. Such expression vectors contain a promoter sequence for efficient transcription of the inserted nucleic acid in a cell. The expression vector typically contains an origin of replication, and a promoter, as well as specific genes that permit phenotypic selection of transformed cells.",
                        "As used herein, \u201chost cells\u201d are cells in which a vector can be propagated and its DNA expressed. The term also includes any progeny of the subject host cell. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical to the parental cell since there may be mutations that occur during replication.

Genes may include regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).",
                        "As used herein, \u201cisolated,\u201d with reference to a nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide or other biomolecule means that the nucleic acid or polypeptide has separated from the genetic environment from which the polypeptide or nucleic acid were obtained. It may also mean altered from the natural state. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present in a living animal is not \u201cisolated\u201d, but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is \u201cisolated\u201d, as the term is employed herein. Thus, a polypeptide or polynucleotide produced and/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated. Also intended as an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d or an \u201cisolated polynucleotide\u201d are polypeptides or polynucleotides that have been purified, partially or substantially, from a recombinant host cell or from a native source. For example, a recombinantly produced version of a compound can be substantially purified by the one-step method described in Smith et al. (1988) Gene 67:3140. The terms isolated and purified are sometimes used interchangeably.",
                        "Thus, by \u201cisolated\u201d the nucleic acid is free of the coding sequences of those genes that, in a naturally-occurring genome immediately flank the gene encoding the nucleic acid of interest. Isolated DNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and may be genomic DNA, cDNA, recombinant hybrid DNA, or synthetic DNA. It may be identical to a native DNA sequence, or may differ from such sequence by the deletion, addition, or substitution of one or more nucleotides.",
                        "Isolated or purified as it refers to preparations made from biological cells or hosts means any cell extract containing the indicated DNA or protein, including a crude extract of the DNA of protein of interest. For example, in the case of a protein, a purified preparation can be obtained following an individual technique or a series of preparative or biochemical techniques and the DNA or protein of interest can be present at various degrees of purity in these preparations. The procedures may include for example, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, density gradient centrifugatioh, electrophoresis, electrofocusing, chromatofocusihg, of other protein purification techniques known in the art.",
                        "A preparation of DNA or protein that is \u201csubstantially pure\u201d or \u201cisolated\u201d should be understood to mean a preparation free from naturally occurring materials with which such DNA or protein is normally associated in nature. \u201cEssentially pure\u201d should be understood to mean a \u201chighly\u201d purified preparation that contains at least 95% of the DNA or protein of interest.",

A total of40,000 compounds was screened at a concentration of 16 \u03bcg/ml using the Mixed Commercials 1,2 & 4, ChemDiv 1 & 2, Specplus, Maybridge 2 & 3, Peakdale2, Starr Foundation Extracts 1 & 2, Philippines Plant Extracts 2, DDS 2, Biomol ICCB known bioreactives, Bionet 2, Enamine 1, IF Lab 1 libraries (http;//iccb.med.harvard.edu/screening/compound_libraries/index.htm). As a positive control for inhibition we used compound A7B7C7 (13) at a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM. Compounds that showed inhibition of at least 60% were considered screening positives. A total of 194 compounds (approximately 0.5% of the compounds screened) met this criterion. 0.3% (=115 compounds) were then retested in the ELISA assay at different concentrations. 25 (0.06%) of the total compounds screened were confirmed as screening positives (FIG. 1C)."

Interestingly, an isomer (6-B234TTQ (ChemDiv, San Diego, Calif.)) that differed in the position of one methoxy group was completely inactive towards the leupaxin \u03b14 interaction (FIG. 2) establishing the exquisite structural specificity of this effect. The effect of compound 6-B345TTQ on other protein-protein interactions that are involved in \u03b14-mediated cell migration to assess its specificity in inhibiting the \u03b14\u2014leupaxin interaction was determined. Compared to A7B7C7 which inhibited the interaction of leupaxin with the focal adhesion targeting sequence of pp125FAK with an IC50 of 300 nM, 6-B345TTQ had no effect on the binding of FAT to leupaxin at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM (FIG. 3C). Interestingly, it did inhibit the interaction of FAT with paxillin. Comparing the effect of 6-B345TTQ on the interaction of \u03b14-integrin with different paxillin paralogues, it was found that leupaxin and paxillin binding were inhibited with IC50 of 18 \u03bcM and 10.8 \u03bcM, respectively (FIG. 3A). To further investigate the characteristics of the inhibitor its effect on the interaction of leupaxin or paxillin with the Arf-GAP Git-1, which binds to the LD4-motif of paxillin, was determined (37, 38). Compound 6-B345TTQ had a strong inhibitory effect on the interaction of GIT-1 with paxillin (IC50=2.4 \u03bcM) and a weaker effect on its interaction with leupaxin (IC50=25 \u03bcM) (FIG. 3B). In contrast, the inactive isomer 6-234TTQ did not inhibit the interaction of paxillin with either FAT or Git-1 (FIG. 3D). The previously identified peptide A7B7C7, inhibited the interaction of paxillin with both, FAT and Git-1 (IC50=1.8 or 1.7 \u03bcM, respectively) (FIG. 3D).",
                                "To investigate the nature of inhibition by 6-345TTQ, the \u03b14 tail, model protein was immobilized to ELISA plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of leupaxin in the presence or absence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. Inhibition was overcome by increasing concentrations of leupaxin indicating that 6-345TTQ acts as a competitive inhibitor. To confirm this hypothesis, data were fitted to equations of different models for inhibition using Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (FIG. 4). The model for competitive inhibition fit the data best with r2=0.9690. Furthermore, we used the mixed model to fit the data resulting in \u03b1-values of \u02dc2.958\u00d71012. When \u03b1 is very large, binding of the inhibitor prevents binding of the substrate and the mixed-model becomes identical to competitive inhibition. These results indicate that 6-345TTQ acts as a competitive inhibitor.",

In paxillin immunoprecipitates, \u03b14-integrin was present and the amount of co-immunoprecipitated \u03b14 decreased with increasing concentrations of 6-345TTQ. The control compound 6-234TTQ did not reduce the amount of precipitated \u03b14."

Directed \u03b14-mediated migration was assessed in a modified Boyden chamber using fibronectin CS-1 fragment (\u03b14 integrin-specific ligand) as a substrate. Cells were tested in the absence or presence of different concentrations of 6-B345TTQ. The compound inhibited monocyte and T-cell migration in a dose dependent manner with 52.6% and 56.4% inhibition of migration at 50 \u03bcM, respectively (FIG. 6B). In contrast, residual \u03b14-dependent migration of Jurkat T cells expressing a mutated \u03b14-integrin (\u03b14(Y991A)) which exhibits reduced paxillin binding; (8) was not further decreased by incubation with 6-B345TTQ (FIG. 8), indicating that the compound specifically inhibits \u03b14-mediated cell migration by blocking paxillin binding.",

Cell migration on ICAM-1 was not significantly reduced (FIG. 6B). The 6-B234TTQ isomer (n.c.) that did not inhibit the \u03b14-paxillin or -leupaxin interactions had no effect on Jurkat cell migration on CS-1 or ICAM-1. In contrast, compound A7B7C7 decreased Jurkat cell migration on both substrates, emphasizing its lack of specificity relative to 6-B345TTQ (FIG. 6B). The lack of effect on \u03b1L\u03b22-mediated migration indicates that compound 6-B345TTQ specifically inhibits \u03b14-mediated Jurkat T cell migration and does not impair the general migration machinery. As an additional test for toxicity of this compound, we examined its effects on cell viability; the compound was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM for 24 h. In sharp contrast, incubation with 50 \u03bcM A7B7C7 for 24 h led to 62% dead cells after 24 h of incubation (FIG. 7).",

In Contrast, CHO cells that express the non-phosphorylatable mutant (CHO-\u03b14S998A cells) have a spreading defect (30, 31) due to increased paxillin binding and the resulting recruitment of Arf-GAPs such as Git-1 (39). Therefore, the spreading defect of CHO-S998A cells was used as a convenient readout for biological consequences of inhibition of paxillin binding to \u03b14-integrin by 6-B345TTQ. CHO-S998A cells were plated oh CS-1 coated cover slips and were allowed to spread for 45 minutes in the presence of increasing concentrations of 6-B345TTQ. Incubation with the compound increased the spreading of CHO-S998A cells to a level comparable with CHO-S998D cells whereas the control compound 6-234TTQ had no effect (FIG. 9B). The same results were observed in Jurkat T cells when spreading was assessed 180 minutes after plating on CS-1 using JB4-Y991A cells as control. In presence of increasing concentrations of the compound a dose dependent increase of cell spreading was observed reaching a level comparable to that of JB4-Y991A cells (FIG. 9A). In contrast, when CHO wildtype cells that do not express \u03b14 were plated on fibronectin and treated with compound 6-B345TTQ cell spreading was not increased (data not shown)."

To explore the importance of integrin \u03b14\u03b21 signaling in LECs, we isolated LECs from mice with an integrin \u03b14Y991A knock-in mutation (29). This mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of integrin \u03b14\u03b21 disrupts integrin \u03b14\u03b21-mediated association with paxillin and talin (12, 41, 42) and blocks \u03b14\u03b21-mediated leukocyte adhesion (42). Although LECs isolated from WT and integrin \u03b14Y991 A mice expressed similar levels of integrin \u03b14\u03b21 (40), LECs from \u03b14Y991A mice did not polarize or develop mature paxillin-containing focal adhesions when adhering to CS-1 fibronectin (FIG. 4B, left). Importantly, \u03b14Y991A LECs failed to migrate in response to VEGF-C (FIG. 4B, right). Additionally, VEGF-C stimulated ex vivo lymphatic vessel sprouting from isolated thoracic ducts (large lymphatic vessels) when isolated from WT but not \u03b14Y991A animals (FIG. 4C). Finally, VEGF-C stimulated lymphangiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in vivo was completely inhibited in integrin \u03b14Y991A mice (FIG. 4D). In fact, integrin \u03b14\u03b21 association with paxillin was suppressed in VEGF-C containing Matrigel plugs from \u03b14Y991A mice, and few \u03b14+paxillin+vessels with well-formed lumen were observed in mutant mice (40). These results indicate that integrin \u03b1a4\u03b21 expression and signal transduction are required for LEC migration and invasive responses to lymphangiogenesis factors in vitro and during in vivo lymphangiogenesis."
