    "abstract": "Human biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (hBTSCs) are being used for cell therapies of patients with liver cirrhosis. A cryopreservation method was established to optimize sourcing of hBTSCs for these clinical programs and that comprises serum-free Kubota\u2019s Medium (KM) supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 15% human serum albumin (HSA) and 0.1% hyaluronans. Cryopreserved versus freshly isolated hBTSCs were similar in vitro with respect to self-replication, stemness traits, and multipotency. They were able to differentiate to functional hepatocytes,cholangiocytes or pancreatic islets, yielding similar levels of secretion of albumin or of glucose-inducible levels of insulin. Cryopreserved versus freshly isolated hBTSCs were equally able to engraft into immunocompromised mice yielding cells with human-specific gene expression and human albumin levels in murine serum that were higher for cryopreserved than for freshly isolated hBTSCs. The successful cryopreservation of hBTSCs facilitates establishment of hBTSCs cell banking offering logistical advantages for clinical programs for treatment of liver diseases.",

                "We have recently demonstrated the presence of cells expressing a constellation of endodermal markers in (peri)-biliary glands of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts1\u20134. These observations in situ in human biliary tree tissues have been complemented by ex vivo demonstrations that there are multiple subpopulations of biliary tree stem cells (BTSCs), all expressing PDX1, SOX17, SALL4, and CD44 and yet with distinctions in other phenotypic traits. The three most common subpopulations are ones with expression of [LGR5+/EpCAM+]; [LGR5/EpCAM-]; and a third [LGR5-/EpCAM-]. All can be isolated from the biliary epithelium and have long-term (in vitro) maintenance and self-renewal, and are able to proceed through different maturational lineages to adult fates that comprise hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and \u03b2-pancreatic cells1\u20134. The discovery of these cells, named human biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (hBTSCs), opens a new scenario with relevant implications in different fields including the embryology of liver, biliary epithelium and pancreas, pathophysiology of biliary tree, hepatobiliary and pancreatic carcinogenesis and, finally, regenerative medicine of liver and pancreas1\u20134. In this regard, the recent demonstration of one of subpopulations of hBTSCs found within the crypts of the gallbladders, and referred to as human gallbladder stem/progenitor cells (hGSCs)5, increases the possibility of a clinical use of these populations of endodermal stem/progenitor cells with multipotential and differentiative capacity (hBTSCs and hGSCs) for cell therapies of liver diseases. Importantly, these cells are easily isolatable and cultivatable and have a low or null immunogenic and oncogenic potential6. Given the various obstacles in cell sourcing for regenerative medicine7, the biliary tree could represent an ideal source of stem cells and progenitors for regenerative medicine. Indeed, we successfully transplanted freshly isolated hBTSCs in cirrhotic patients with benefits in terms of improvement of liver functions8.",
                "Human tissues are difficult to obtain, and the current requirement for clinical programs, that cells be freshly isolated, hampers sourcing of cells for treatments of patients. For this reason, cryopreservation represents an obligatory step for routine uses of cell products in clinical programs of cell therapies. A number of different cryopreservation techniques have been proposed including the use of cryopreservation agents9, 10, a cell coating technique11\u201313, pre-conditioning techniques14, and gradual freezing15, 16. Unfortunately, with regard to cell types isolated from solid organs, like hepatic cells, a large variability in terms of cell viability and engraftment efficiency after thawing has been reported14, 17, 18. Terry et al.14, for example, proposed the use of purified human serum albumin as an alternative to serum in order to preserve high viability and to achieve a defined cryopreservation condition. More recently, Turner et al.19 developed an efficient strategy to preserve adhesion molecule expression during human hepatic stem cell (hHpSC) cryopreservation by using either of two serum-free, wholly defined buffers that were supplemented with hyaluronans: Crystor-10 (CS10; Biolife Solutions, Bothell, WA, USA) or Kubota\u2019s Medium (Phoenix Songs Biologicals, Branford, CT). Kubota\u2019s Medium (KM) was designed for endodermal stem cells and is described in more detail in the methods section. It is distinctive in having no cytokines, growth factors or hormones other than insulin and transferrin. Even though it is not isotonic, its ability as a cryopreservation buffer has proved similar to that of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) approved Cryostor-1020. We utilized serum-free KM that was supplemented with different concentrations of human serum-derived albumin (HSA) and/or hyaluronic acid (HA) to generate conditions effective in cryopreservation of hBTSCs from adult donors under GMP like conditions."

Figure\u00a01 and Supplementary Figure\u00a01 show the cell viability and morphology of hBTSC cultures after 4 weeks of cryopreservation in the basal control solution. After thawing, cells were grown for a period of 30 days in Kubota\u2019s Medium (KM). The hBTSCs were able to form cell colonies that were morphologically similar to those generated by freshly isolated cells (Supplementary Figure\u00a01). We tested various cryopreservation buffers. All of them were comprised of serum-free KM supplemented with 10% dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) and with distinctions in containing different concentrations of HSA and HA. The percent of viable cells was assessed after 4 weeks of cryopreservation and immediately after thawing (N\u2009=\u20099). Cells in Solution 1 (Sol1: supplemented further with 0.1% HA\u2009+\u200915% HSA) had an average viability of 72.78\u2009\u00b1\u20095.65%.

We tested cultures of hBTSCs after cryopreservation in Sol1 (Figs\u00a03A and 4A), Sol3 (data not shown) versus freshly isolated cells (Figs\u00a03 B and 4B). For differentiation conditions, we used different hormonally defined media (HDM) specifically tailored to induce the differentiation of hBTSCs to mature hepatocytes (HM), cholangiocytes (CM) or pancreatic islets (PM). KM without hydrocortisone was used as a control since this medium is permissive for cell expansion and is neutral for differentiation towards both liver and for pancreas (glucocorticoids must be avoided for pancreatic differentiation).

When hBTSCs (Sol1 and freshly isolated) were transferred from KM to HM for 2 weeks, significant increases in expression of mature hepatocyte-specific genes were observed including (e.g. Albumin (Alb); N\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.01 vs KM; Transferrin (Transf); N\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs KM and Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); N\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009<\u20090.01 vs KM) (Fig.\u00a04).

The livers were then analysed 30 days after cell transplantation by immunohistochemistry with an antibody to human mitochondria as previously described5. As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, cryopreserved (Sol1) hBTSCs engrafted into liver parenchyma with the same efficiency as freshly isolated cells (N\u2009=\u20093; p\u2009>\u20090.05).

To confirm the effective engraftment and differentiation of transplanted cryopreserved hBTSCs into the murine livers, we measured human albumin mRNA in the liver and human albumin (protein) in the serum. The expression of human albumin mRNA in the liver was significantly higher (N\u2009=\u20093; p\u2009<\u20090.01) in mice transplanted with cryopreserved hBTSCs (5.19*10\u22127\u2009\u00b1\u20093.06*10\u22127) than mice transplanted with freshly isolated hBTSCs (1.90*10\u221210\u2009\u00b1\u20091.09*10\u221210) (Fig.\u00a06B).

                "We have established a successful cryopreservation protocol for hBTSCs comprised of serum-free Kubota\u2019s Medium (KM) supplemented with DMSO (10%), HA (0.1%) and high concentrations of HSA (15%). The key findings leading to this conclusion arethat: 1) hBTSCs can survive and have a high viability on thawing (~80%) after 120 days of cryopreservation if subjected to this cryopreservation buffer; 2) the in vitro proliferation rate (population doubling times) and colony formation capacity were improved by supplementation of cryopreservation buffers with HA (0.1%); 3) hBTSCs cryopreserved in buffers containing high albumin concentrations\u2009\u00b1\u2009HA, efficiently differentiated in vitro to mature fates (hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, or functional pancreatic \u03b2-cells); 4) hBTSCs cryopreserved in the buffer containing high albumin concentrations\u2009+\u2009HA effectively engrafted and differentiated in vivo after transplantation in SCID mice.",
                "KM was designed for endodermal stem cells, and it is distinctive in having no cytokines, growth factors or hormones other than insulin and transferrin. Even though it is not isotonic, its ability as a cryopreservation buffer has proved similar to that of the GMP Cryostor-1020. Here, we utilized serum-free KM that was supplemented with different concentrations of HSA and/or HA to generate conditions effective in cryopreservation of hBTSCs from adult donors under GMP like conditions. Notably, the translation to a clinical grade GMP protocol is a ready option based on the present and previous results from a companion study20.",
                "Strategies of cell cryopreservation aim to protect mechanisms of cell viability and proliferative capacity and are based on the use of isotonic buffers, antifreeze proteins (from Artic animals), antioxidants and freezing reagents such as DMSO or glycerol. The existing methods work well for hematopoietic cell subpopulations, since they inherently have extracellular matrix components that are missing cell binding domains and so the cells are able to float. Thus, their adhesion and other matrix-dependent functions are intact and not adversely affected by cryopreservation. By contrast, isolation of cells from solid organs requires enzymatic activity that dissolves the matrix enabling the cells to be dispersed into cell suspensions, making these cells vulnerable to adverse effects of cryopreservation on matrix-dependent activities20. Liver cells, including hepatocytes, are representative of cells from solid organs and demonstrating enormous difficulties encountered in cryopreservation14. In addition, cryopreservation of stem/progenitor cells has additional obstacles over those formature cells, since many additives of cryopreservation buffers, such as serum, can eliminate stemness traits and, in parallel, trigger differentiation20. We demonstrated previously that these obstacles can be overcome by using an isotonic medium such as Cryostor-10 or a wholly defined, serum-free stem cell medium, KM supplemented with hyaluronans, a dominant constituent of the matrix chemistry of stem cell niches21. In this study we were able to improve the conditions further by adding high levels of HSA (15%).We evaluated the maintenance, after cryopreservation, of key cell phenotypic properties such as viability, seeding, proliferation rate and differentiation potential1, 19. Firstly, we observed that cryopreservation in either serum-free buffer(Sol1 or Sol3) containing high levels of HSA (15%) resulted in a significantly better cell viability, after thawing, when compared to cells in the other buffers tested. Therefore, supplementation with high concentrations of HSA (15% compared to 1.5%) facilitates the maintenance of cell viability after thawing. Previously, Terry et al.14 had proposed that human serum albumin could represent an alternative to foetal serum assuming that the high levels of albumin contained in the serum is the major determinant of the serum cryo-protective effect; our results confirmed the role of albumin as a cryo-protective agent.",
                "We further demonstrated that cryopreservation in solutions containing high albumin concentration \u00b1HA protects hBTSCs from cell senescence. Cell senescence is correlated with telomere shortening during cell divisions, but, stem cells counteract senescence through high telomerase activity22, 23, and this has been demonstrated by Reid and associates in hepatic stem cells22, 23. Proliferation rates in vitro have been analysed by population doubling assays in which we demonstrated the preservation of the proliferation capabilities by cryopreserved hBTSCs with respect to freshly isolated cells. Seeding and proliferation are both correlated with colony formation capacity 20. In our study we tested whether the colony formation properties are influenced by any of the cryopreservation buffers. Expression of some adhesion molecules (e.g. ITGB4) was improved and that of CD44 unaffected, whereas others were reduced (ITGB1, CDH1). Still proliferation in cells cryopreserved in Sol1 versus Sol3 were similar, but with dramatic increases in colony formation in those in Sol1 containing both the high albumin levels and also HA. It is noteworthy that all subpopulations of stem cells and progenitors in the liver express CD44, the receptor for HA, and that apoptosis is increased in cells that are unable to regain adhesion proteins quickly following thawing20. HA represents the main constituent of the liver stem cell niche24. Turner et al.20 observed that the use of supplementation with hyaluronans constitutes a successful option for an optimal cryopreservation of human hepatic stem/progenitor cells (hHpSC). Here we demonstrated a positive role of HA as a preconditioning agent which could favour the engraftment of cells after cryopreservation. Indeed, data obtained by RT-qPCR demonstrated that in hBTSCs cryopreserved in Sol1, the expression of adhesion molecules is partially preserved, while genes of pluripotency and endodermal stem cells are entirely preserved, as compared to expression in freshly isolated cells. These data are in agreement with the previous results by Turner et al.20. Finally and most importantly, the differentiation potential of hBTSCs was unaffected and similar to that of freshly isolated cells when cryopreserved in Sol1 or Sol3 containing high albumin concentration \u00b1HA1\u20134, 25. Indeed, we showed in vitro, in media specifically tailored to induce the selective differentiation of hBTSCs to hepatocytes, cholangiocytes or pancreatic cells, that the differentiation capacities are also well preserved by our protocol of cryopreservation. They are not influenced by HA. This has also been demonstrated at a functional level by evaluating the albumin synthesis/secretion capacity of cells differentiated toward hepatocytes and insulin production, in both basal conditions and after glucose challenge, in cells differentiated toward pancreatic cells.",
                "Finally, and most importantly, we demonstrated that hBTSCs cryopreserved in buffers containing high albumin +HA (Sol1) and transplanted into SCID mice, displayed an engraftment and differentiation efficiency even better than freshly isolated cells. The percent of human cells hosting murine liver and the synthesis and secretion of human albumin were in fact better for cryopreserved than freshly isolated hBTSCs (Sol1 vs freshly isolated). This surprising result is in keeping with observations in vitro in which HA improves cell engraftment and with observations in vivo in which cells coated with HA showed higher rates of liver engraftment, after transplantation, than freshly isolated cells. In a recent paper26, we demonstrated that hyaluronan coating improves liver engraftment of transplanted human biliary tree stem/progenitor cells. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that HA used during the cryopreservation process could dictate a facilitation of engraftment of the cryopreserved hBTSCs after their thawing and infusion. Thus, HA supplementation during cryopreservation could act as a preconditioning method allowing a greater number of hBTSCs to engraft within the liver parenchyma, survive, proliferate, and enhance human albumin secretion."
