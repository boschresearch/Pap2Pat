    "title": "Bioconversion of Rebaudioside I from Rebaudioside A",
    "date": "2014-10-28",
    "abstract": "To supply the increasing demand of natural high potency sweeteners to reduce the calories in food and beverages, we have looked to steviol glycosides. In this work we report the bioconversion of rebaudioside A to rebaudioside I using a glucosyltransferase enzyme. This bioconversion reaction adds one sugar unit with a 1\u21923 linkage. We utilized 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC-DEPT, HMBC, 1D TOCSY and NOESY) and mass spectral data to fully characterize rebaudioside I.",

                "In the past decade the food industry has dedicated concerted efforts to develop natural non-caloric high potency sweeteners. The demand for alternative sweeteners comes from the overwhelming consumer preference for taste of sugar, but without calories. The food industry has heavily invested in the discovery of novel natural steviol glycosides that have the ability to sweeten products and provide no caloric content. Steviol glycosides are most commonly isolated from Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, a perennial shrub of the Asteraceae (Compositae) family native to Paraguay and Brazil [1]. Isolation of steviol glycosides from S. rebaudiana leaves over the past thirty years have uncovered the wide variety of their molecular complexity [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Most recently, Ibrahim et al. isolated two novel diterpene glycosides and five known glycosides from a commercial extract of S. rebaudiana [12]. Steviolbioside, stevioside, rebaudioside A\u2013F, dulcoside A and rubusoside are the most abundant steviol glycosides found in the leaves of S. rebaudiana [13].",
                "Recently we reported the isolation, full characterization, and sensory properties of rebaudioside M (1) from S. rebaudiana Bertoni (Figure 1) [14,15]. Rebaudioside M is approximately 200\u2013350 times as potent as sucrose [15]. Sensory evaluations determined rebaudioside M\u2019s taste profile to be a clean, sweet taste, with a slightly bitter and licorice-like aftertaste. This work illustrated that the configuration of glycosylation (number of sugar units and the sugar linkages) influences the sweet taste profile of steviol glycoside molecules.",
                "Due to the relative low abundance of certain sweet steviol glycosides in plant material, numerous organizations have invested in biotechnology to produce larger quantities of desired steviol glycosides [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Most recently we have pursued the bioconversion reaction of rebaudioside A to rebaudioside D with UGT (UDP-glycosyltransferase) enzymes. This bioconversion reaction allowed for the isolation and characterization of two novel steviol glycosides, rebaudioside M2 (2) and rebaudioside D2 (3) (Figure 1) [24,25]. Both molecules contain a 1\u21926 sugar linkage, which is rarely found in the steviol glycoside family.",
                "Based on previous experiences with the bioconversion reactions we investigated the bioconversion of rebaudioside A (4) to rebaudioside I (5) (Figure 2). The bioconversion reaction was analyzed by HPLC with reference standards. Rebaudioside I, a natural non-claoric sweetener, was produced with a 22.5% yield (135 mg) (based on total area percent of HPLC-MS SIM chromatography) (Figure 3). We report herein the isolation and full characterization of rebaudioside I, determined by 1D and 2D NMR experiments together with mass spectral data. Ohta et al. first reported the isolation of rebaudioside I in S. rebaudiana Morita, although full spectral assignment was not reported [9,26]."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Rebaudioside I (5) was isolated as a white solid and accurate mass measurement using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) provided an exact mass m/z of 1127.4741, [M\u2212H]\u2212 in its negative ESI-TOF mass spectrum, corresponding to the molecular formula C50H79O28 (see Supplementary Information). The MS/MS spectrum of 5, selecting the [M\u2212H]\u2212 ion at m/z 1127.4 for fragmentation, indicated loss of two sugar units at m/z 803.5301, however it did not show additional fragmentations with a collision energy of 30 V. When a higher collision energy was applied (60 V), the parent ion was not observed, but sequential loss of three sugar units at m/z 641.4488, 479.3897, and 317.3023 were observed from m/z 803.5301.",
                "Having confirmed the molecular weight of compound 5, a series of 1D and 2D NMR experiments were performed to allow for the full assignment of rebaudioside I. Our initial 1H-NMR spectrum was acquired at 300 K, where one of the anomeric protons was completely obscured by the water resonance. Therefore, 1H-NMR spectrum of the sample was acquired at lower temperature (292 K), to shift out the water resonance, and at this temperature all anomeric protons were sufficiently resolved (Supplementary Information). Thus, all other NMR data of 5 was acquired at 292 K.",
                "The 1H-NMR spectrum and the HSQC-DEPT data of rebaudioside I (5) indicated the existence of two methyl singlets at \u03b4 1.22 (C-18) and 1.26 (C-20), two olefinic proton singlets corresponding to an exocyclic double bond at \u03b4H 5.02 and at 5.67 (C-17), nine methylene and two methine protons between \u03b4H 0.74\u20132.59 characteristic for the ent-kaurane diterpenoid isolated from other Stevia extracts [27,28]. The ent-kaurane diterpenoid aglycone central core was supported by 1H-1H COSY and 1H-13C HMBC correlations shown in Figure 4. The complete 1H and 13C assignments of the central diterpene core are provided in Table 1 (positions 1\u201320).",
                "Correlations observed in the NOESY spectrum were used to assign the relative stereochemistry of the central diterpene core. In the NOESY spectrum, NOE correlations were observed between H-14 and H-20 indicating that H-14 and H-20 are on the same face of the rings. Similarly, NOE correlations were observed between H-9 and H-5 as well as H-5 and H-18. NOE correlations between H-9 and H-14 were not observed. The NOESY data thus indicate that H-5, H-9 and H-18 were on the opposite face of the rings compared to H-14 and H-20. These data thus indicate that the relative stereochemistry in the central core was retained during the glycosylation step.",
                "The breakdown of the 1H-13C HSQC-DEPT data for 5 confirmed the presence of five anomeric protons. All five anomeric protons were resolved in the spectra acquired at 292 K at \u03b4H 6.14 (\u03b4C 95.3), 5.57 (\u03b4C 104.6), 5.38 (\u03b4C 104.7), 5.29 (\u03b4C 105.0), and 5.06 (\u03b4C 98.0) (Table 1). Additionally, all five anomeric protons had large couplings (7.7\u20138.2 Hz) indicating that they had \u03b2-configurations. The anomeric proton observed at \u03b4H 6.14 showed an HMBC correlation to C-19 (\u03b4C 176.9) which indicated that it corresponds to the anomeric proton of GlcI. Similarly, the anomeric proton observed at \u03b4H 5.06 showed an HMBC correlation to C-13 (\u03b4C 86.7) allowing it to be assigned as the anomeric proton of GlcII (Figure 4).",
                "Additional analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR data allowed the assignment of the remaining three sugars in 5. The relatively downfield chemical shift of C-3' (\u03b4C 89.4) in sugar I suggested the presence of a sugar substituent at C-3' of sugar I. Long range 1H-13C correlations observed in the HMBC experiment from the anomeric proton observed at \u03b4H 5.29 (H-1''''') to the carbon at \u03b4C 89.4 (C-3') and from H-3' at \u03b4H 4.27 to an anomeric carbon at \u03b4C 105.0 (C-1''''') confirmed the substitution at C-3' in sugar I.",
                "The remaining two glucose moieties were assigned in a similar manner. The relatively downfield chemical shift of C-2'' (\u03b4C 80.6) and C-3'' (\u03b4C 87.5) in sugar II suggested a 2,3-branched-d-glucotriosyl substituent at C-13. Long range 1H-13C correlations observed in the HMBC experiment from the anomeric proton observed at \u03b4H 5.57 (H-1''') to the carbon at \u03b4C 80.6 (C-2'') and from H-2'' at \u03b4H 4.35 to an anomeric carbon at \u03b4C 104.6 (C-1''') confirmed the presence of a 1\u21922 sugar linkage between sugar III and sugar II. Similarly, the sugar substituent at C-3'' in sugar II was also corroborated by HMBC correlations observed from the anomeric proton at \u03b4H 5.38 (H-1'''') to the carbon at \u03b4C 87.5 (C-3'') and from H-3'' at \u03b4H 4.20 to the anomeric carbon (\u03b4C 104.7) of sugar IV confirmed the presence of a 1\u21923 sugar linkage between sugar IV and sugar II.",
                "The complete 1H and 13C assignments for the glycoside at C-13 and C-19 were made on the basis of COSY, HSQC-DEPT, HMBC, and 1D-TOCSY data and are provided in Table 1. A summary of the key HMBC, COSY, and 1D-TOCSY correlations used to assign the glycoside are provided in Figure 5.Thus the structure of rebaudioside I (5), was confirmed as (13-[(2-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid-(3-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl) ester]."

With continued progress of isolation and characterization of novel steviol glycosides, further relationships between the amount of sugar units connected at C-13 and C-19 of the steviol aglycone core and degree of sweetness will be uncovered."
