                                "There consequently has arisen an almost equally diverse range of approaches to magnetic field sensor design in terms of foundational principles of operation. For example, super quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors operate based on the quantization of magnetic flux, optically pumped sensors operate based on atomic magneto-optic effects, induction sensors operate based on Faraday's law of induction, and magnetic tunnel junction sensors operate based on polarization dependent electron tunneling.",
                                "One defining characteristic of a magnetic field sensor is sensitivity\u2014the lowest field value that can be detected above the noise floor in a unit of output bandwidth. A higher sensitivity, or the ability to detect weaker fields, is crucial in modern applications where working with weak fields is the overwhelming norm. The sensitivity is strongly dependent on the principle of operation of a sensor; however, the fact that there are still so many sensor types used today clearly indicates that there are other important characteristics that must also be considered. Specifically, it tends to be the case that principles yielding higher sensitivity have tradeoffs with regards to sensor size or power consumption that limit practicality and cost of implementation.",
                                "The tradeoff between sensitivity and practicality may be better illustrated by examining various principles of operation. SQUID magnetic field sensors are widely recognized to be the most sensitive devices, able to achieve sensitivities better than 1 fT/Hz1/2; however, they require cryogenic cooling which leads to a system that is large and costly in terms of construction and power consumption. Optically pumped sensors can be competitive with SQUIDs in sensitivity, but are afflicted by the requirement of optically pumped, heated atomic vapor cells which contribute again to a large and costly system that is complex to design and manufacture.",
                                "Optically pumped sensors are capable of achieving sub-pT/Hz1/2 sensitivities in the kHz to MHz frequency range but require a sensor volume of approximately 57 cubic millimeters and power consumption on the order of Watts. Inductive sensors boast zero power consumption while also being able to attain sensitivities better than 1 fT/Hz1/2; however, reaching these sensitivities generally requires the device to be prohibitively large or heavy. The use of inductive sensors can achieve sub-fT/Hz1/2 sensitivity in the hundreds of Hz to hundreds of kHz frequency range but require a sensor area of more than 24 square meters.",
                                "Magnetic tunnel junctions can be made extremely small; however, they consume moderate amounts of power and achieve moderate sensitivities. The use of an MgO based magnetic tunnel junction sensor was constructed with a sensor area of just 626 \u03bcm2, but there is only 97 pT/Hz1/2 sensitivity below 500 kHz as well as a power consumption of around \u22127 dBm (\u02dc0.1995 mW).",
                                "In contrast, the present disclosure introduces a novel approach that allows for the realization of sensitive magnetic field sensors operating in the low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) bands that also maintain a high degree of practicality. A preliminary design exhibits a sensitivity threshold of less than 27 pT/Hz1/2 flat in these bands. While this design has only a moderately high sensitivity, it boasts a sensor volume of only 0.053 cubic millimeters (mm3) and a very low power consumption of just \u221240 dBm (\u02dc1e\u22127 Watts).",

Perhaps foremost among these changes involves the medium from which the spins are sourced. Optical magnetometers use spins sourced from atomic vapors, the glass containers of which are the bottleneck preventing reductions in cost and device size. In contrast, the present disclosure focuses instead on spins sourced from insulating ferrimagnetic materials, or ferrites. The insulating nature, low magnetic loss at high frequencies, and significant saturation magnetization values of ferrites are all imperative toward achieving high performance magnetic field sensors. Some of these attributes motivated inductive coil antennas using ferrites, although of course these never employed the use of nonlinear spin precession dynamics or other aspects of the operating principles of the present disclosure. Ferrites additionally have an extensive history of incorporation in general high frequency electronics resulting in now well-established processing methods that allow the material to be produced relatively inexpensively, which can be leveraged when implementing the teachings of the present disclosure.",

This theory is able to practically describe the average behavior of the large ensemble of spins of a macroscopic ferrite material and is formulated classically in terms of the spatially and temporally dependent material magnetization M(r,t) based on a continuum approximation. References to magnetization as opposed to spin will consequently be made for all following analyses for the purposes of consistency, where it is recognized that either may be immediately determined based on knowledge of the other. From micromagnetic theory, the magnetization dynamics of a ferrite material are governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation:",

For purposes of simplicity, the assumption will be made initially that He(r,t) is spatially uniform with the dominant contributor to its value being some constant magnetic field H0. It will further be assumed that the magnitude |He(r,t)|=He(r,t) is sufficiently large such that M(r,t) is also spatially uniform, and that magnetic loss is neglected.",

The equation indicates the equilibrium state of M(t) to be aligned with He, where it is noted that spatial and temporal dependencies of these and all following variables will be omitted as appropriate. Any perturbation from the equilibrium state will result in a continuous precession of M(t) about He, as visualized in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, at the resonance frequency f0 given by:",

Equation (2) contains the essence of optical magnetometry operations in which it may be seen that, by determining f0 through some means, an unknown He can be directly computed. While such an approach is not readily extended suitably for receiving antenna operation, equation (2) also allows the correct presumption to be made that a time varying effective field magnitude, say due to an additional magnetic field hs(t) contributing to the effective field such that He (t)=H0+hs(t), will result in a time varying precession frequency.",

Framed in more practical terms, consider the precession of M(t) for a ferrite biased with a sufficiently large magnetic field H0. A dynamic, spatially uniform magnetic field hs(t) is imposed on the ferrite and is polarized such that hs(t) is parallel to H0, and will result in a time varying He (t). This magnetic field thus manifests as a frequency modulation of the precession, a detection of which then allows for ensuing extraction of all the information that can be known about both the magnitude and phase of the dynamic field."

                                "Intimately related to the amplification advantage of magnetic field sensors based on RPM is their advantage of a physically compact size, where size may be characterized by the size of the inductive detection coil. Simply put, equation (5) indicates that the area A of the inductive detection coil may be reduced by at most the value of equation (7) while still maintaining a transduced signal strength larger than or equal to that of a conventional inductive coil of the original size A.",
                                "Also closely related to the amplification advantage is the sensitivity advantage of magnetic field sensors based on RPM. Again, the sources of amplification originate directly from the magnetic material and its intrinsic nonlinear magnetization dynamics. Distinct from conventional cases where amplification is achieved by external circuitry after the antenna which raises not only the signal amplitude but also the noise level, the amplification offered by the RPM scheme occurs in the material before the inductive detection coil where Johnson thermal noise and ferrite damping noise are generated, similar to the case of how a low noise amplifier is added before the antenna. Thus, transduced signal amplification is achieved without raising the noise generated by the inductive detection coil, immediately indicating a much-improved sensitivity as compared to inductive antennas operating under conventional principles.",
                                "As mentioned previously, the limit to sensitivity is ultimately determined by thermal noise generated by the ferrite loaded inductive detection coil. For an approximate quantification of achievable sensitivities, a thin film YIG ferrite material with a linewidth of 0.2 Oe, supposing a bias field of 70 Oe, corresponding to a thin film resonance frequency of 1 GHz, then equation (10) indicates that a power consumption of just \u221224 dBm will allow for sub-pT/Hz1/2 sensitivity.",
                                "Of some merit is an explicit distinction between the advantages of RPM based magnetic field sensors and those of the previously mentioned conventional antennas incorporating ferrites. Among these previous antennas, the ferrite rod antenna is of particular interest due to its relative success and widespread usage as well as its architecture, which has some initial resemblance to that of the RPM based magnetic field sensors. The ferrite rod antenna consists of a conducting coil wrapped around a ferrite core, as illustrated in FIG. 2C, and operates entirely based upon conventional direct voltage induction. The ferrite core serves solely as a source of magnetization to magnify the magnetic flux that an incident magnetic field couples to the coil, likewise magnifying the transduced signal strength. In this regard, the ferrite rod antenna possesses the same advantages of amplification, size, and sensitivity compared to a conventional inductive coil as does the RPM based magnetic field sensors.",
                                "However, not only is the typical amplification achieved by a ferrite rod inductive coil quite low, falling in the range of approximately a factor of 50, but also the antenna is associated with significant magnetic losses that do not affect the RPM based magnetic field sensors. These losses arise from the fact that ferrite core of the ferrite rod inductive coil is unbiased and includes hysteresis loss, loss due to domain wall resonance, and loss due to thermally activated domain wall movements. The magnetic losses in the ferrite core become additional sources of thermal noise for conventional ferrite rod antennas while they are absent in the RPM based sensors as the ferrite is biased into saturation and free of domain wall movements. Furthermore, the lower amplification of the ferrite rod antenna immediately indicates lower sensitivity as well as lower potential size reduction as compared to the RPM based magnetic field sensors."

                                "For the purposes of tractability, a simplified scenario was maintained throughout much of the prior analyses and developments by making various assumptions. While most of these assumptions are easily maintained in practice, a particular few necessitate a thoughtful approach to implementation and consideration of phenomena previously neglected in order to hold to them. Perhaps chief amongst these phenomena is demagnetization. Demagnetization is an equivalent description of the dipole-dipole interaction between subatomic magnetic moments of the ferrite material and is in general dependent on the material shape, size, and magnetization orientation. Accounting for its effects on magnetization dynamics may be accomplished with an additive term Hd(r,t) in the effective field of equation (1), written now as:",

                                "where Hd (r,t) is known as the demagnetization field and both H0 and hs(t) are the familiar magnetic fields from prior analyses. Most notable about the demagnetization field in this context is the fact that it is in general spatially nonuniform, thus clearly invalidating the original assumption of a uniform He (r,t) and giving rise to complications in the practical implementation of RPM. The ramifications of this nonuniformity can be approximately understood as a spatially nonuniform magnetization precession resonance frequency which not only destroys the phase coherence of M(r,t) precession throughout the ferrite, but also introduces additional complicating phenomena such as exchange coupling. The resulting information that may be extracted from a detection of precession during RPM operation is thus significantly degraded in quality if not completely unusable.",
                                "The implementation approach taken to address the effects of demagnetization and maintain a uniform effective field involves an appropriate choice of ferrite shape. Specifically, the shape is selected such that, for all orientations of a uniform M(t) occurring throughout normal RPM operation, Hd (r,t) is either negligible in magnitude or approximately uniform in space. With several viable options that may satisfy these conditions, in at least one example embodiment it has been chosen to use ferrites with a thin film geometry for which in-plane orientations of M(t) will yield a negligible demagnetization field whereas out of plane orientations will yield an approximately uniform demagnetization field. Any arbitrary orientation of M(t) is effectively a superposition of an in-plane and an out of plane component and thus it is clear that the uniformity of He (r,t) can always be maintained. Ferrites of a thin-film geometry, as compared to those of other potentially suitable shapes, have the additional benefit that associated processing methods such as pulsed laser deposition, spin spray plating, or liquid phase epitaxy are mature enough to produce films of extremely high quality.",
                                "With the complications accompanying demagnetization accounted for, all other details of practical implementation follow in a fairly straightforward manner. In this work, the bias field H0, required to establish uniformity of M(t) as well as a precession center frequency about which the modulation of RPM occurs, is applied with permanent magnets. The perturbation field Hp(t), required to maintain M(t) precession amid a finite magnetic loss, is applied using a conducting coil driven continuously at f0 of equation (2). Lastly, inductive detection of magnetization dynamics, required to obtain an electrical signal from which information may be extracted, is performed with another conducting coil. With regards to this detection, it of interest to recognize that, since Hd(r,t) is not always negligible throughout operation of RPM using a thin film ferrite, equation (13) indicates that it still has some effect on the magnetization precession dynamics. This effect is a modification of the precession such that it approximately resembles a pendulum oscillation as visualized in FIG. 1D. While this has no significant bearing on operation, it is of importance in deciding upon orientation of the inductive detector to achieve the largest transduced signal.",

Lastly, a perturbing magnetic field Hp(t) is applied as a sinusoid with amplitude 0.025 Oe at a frequency of 848 MHz.

Lastly, the perturbation field Hp(t) is applied with a single turn loop of area 95 mm2 fabricated on a Rogers 4003C board and driven by a function generator for the sake of this testing. For all results from this setup, the perturbation loop was driven sinusoidally at the precession resonance frequency to deliver \u221255 dBm of power to the sensor whereas the coil generating hs(t) was driven sinusoidally with varied voltages and frequencies to evaluate trends in the behavior of the system.

In both cases, the expected sum and difference frequency terms f0\u00b1fs as well as the unmodulated frequency term f0 are clearly evident, demonstrating that RPM operation is achieved. Comparing between the two cases then it is seen that doubling the driving voltage effectively doubles the amplitude ratio of equation (8). Recognizing that the driving voltage is directly proportional to the hs(t) field amplitude Hs by antenna theory, then the linear relationship between the amplitude ratios and Hs is thus confirmed.",

This setup essentially involves the same incident magnetic field as in the first experimental setup now directly inducing voltages in the inductive detection loop in order to achieve transduction into electrical signals. This field is generated by the same coil driven sinusoidally by a function generator with the same voltages and frequencies as previously exemplified. The same 9.9 cm distance separates the inductive detection loop from the coil. Based on a comparison of the received signals observed to those of the first setup, an amplification metric is computed and presented in Table 2. From this table, it is seen that significant amplification is achieved for all cases under consideration, demonstrating promise for RPM based magnetic field sensor applications in the very low frequency (VLF) and low frequency (LF) bands. It is also possible to conclude from Table 2 that amplification grows as the coil driving frequency decreases, as expected from equation (7). It is further noted that the amplification can easily be increased with an increase in pumping power.",

However, the setup of FIG. 4 as it stood was not suitable for measurements of sensitivity, since the noise floor would be limited by phase noise of the function generator producing the perturbation field. Consequently, the received signals at the sum and difference frequencies f0\u00b1fs were coherently demodulated down to baseband fs using an Analog Devices ADL5380 evaluation board 232, shown with internal mixers 234a, 234b and quadrature phase splitter 236.",

This yielded a demodulated signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 41.5 dB, from which sensitivity may be computed to be 27.1 pT/Hz1/2. It is noted that this sensitivity was found to be fairly constant with varying frequency, as expected based on equation (20). Comparing conventional ferrite rod antennas operating at similar frequencies, the ferrite rod antennas can achieve a sensitivity about two to three orders of magnitude better than the disclosed RPM based sensor, but they require a volume six orders of magnitude greater. The theoretical sensitivity was calculated using a modified version of equation (20) that accounts for the hardware and electronics of the setup, yielding a value of 15.7 pT/Hz1/2.

The general concept of RPM operation has proven to be viable through both simulation and experiment. With the RPM based magnetic field sensor implementation in this disclosure being of a rather simple makeshift nature, it is expected that further refinements will only establish the practical capabilities of these antennas more substantially. For example, an inductive detector design that mitigates shielding effects on the ferrite material will result in a larger transduced signal as would alternatively or additionally provide an increase in the ferrite material volume. Most promising about RPM based magnetic field sensor operation is the fact that it is fundamentally different from conventional antenna operation, possessing the potential to contribute a completely new paradigm to low frequency antenna design and overcome longstanding barriers in performance.",
