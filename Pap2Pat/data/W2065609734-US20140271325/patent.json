It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.",
                        "Introduction",
                        "Desirable properties, such as high strength and increased resistance, have spurred considerable research in nanocrystalline metals with an average grain size generally smaller than 100 nm. These properties may arise from a high number of grain boundaries and may vary greatly even with small variations in grain size. FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b) present mechanical test data on nanocrystalline Ni\u2014W alloys. A grain size change from 10 to 100 nm may produce a hardness decrease of about 50% and an increase of more than four times in activation volume (rate sensitivity may be denoted as the inverse of the activation volume). Therefore, controlling grain size may be important to tailor the material properties of nanocrystalline metals.",
                        "Additionally, specific grain size (or size range) may correspond to the desired mechanical properties. As shown in FIG. 1(a), hardness may peak at a grain size of about 10 nm, and then decrease with further grain refinement. The activation volume may also decrease and then increase as grain size becomes smaller, as shown in FIG. 1(b). A shear band may become noticeable in a Ni\u2014W alloy with a grain size below 12 nm, as shown in FIGS. 2(a)-2(d). As a result, a finite grain size may exist which results in a desired value for a property. Thus, scalable control over grain size may be an important feature of manufacturing nanocrystalline metal materials with desired properties.",
                        "Nanocrystalline Materials",
                        "Nanocrystalline materials may generally refer to materials that comprise grains with a size in the nanometer range\u2014i.e., smaller than about 1000 nm: e.g., smaller than or equal to about 900 nm, about 800 nm, about 700 nm, about 600 nm, about 500 nm, about 400 nm, about 300 nm, about 200 nm, about 150 nm, about 100 nm, about 50 nm, about 30 nm, about 20 nm, about 10 nm, about 5 nm, about 2 nm, or smaller. In some embodiments herein, to further distinguish the different grain size regimes, the term \u201cultra-fine grain\u201d is used to denote a grain size of greater than about 100 nm and less than about 1000 nm and the term \u201cnanocrystalline grain\u201d is used to denote a grain size of less than or equal to about 100 nm. In one embodiment, the nanocrystalline material may be a polycrystalline material. In another embodiment the nanocrystalline material may be a single crystalline material.",
                        "In one embodiment, the grain size may refer to the largest dimension of a grain. The dimension may refer to the diameter, length, width, or height of a grain, depending on the geometry thereof. In one embodiment, the grains may be spherical, cubic, conical, cylindrical, needle-like, or any other suitable geometry.",
                        "In one embodiment, the nanocrystalline material may be in the form of particulates. The shape of the particulates may be spherical, cubical, conical, cylindrical, needle-like, irregular, or any other suitable geometry.",
                        "In one embodiment, the nanocrystalline material may be a nanocrystalline alloy that may comprise a first metal material and a second metal material. The first and/or second metal material may comprise a first and/or second metal element, respectively. The term \u201celement\u201d herein refers to the chemical symbol that may be found in the Periodic Table. The first metal material may be a metal element. A metal element may include any of the elements in Groups 3-14 of the Periodic Table. In one embodiment, the metal element may be a refractory metal element. In another embodiment, the metal element is a transition metal (any of those in Groups 3-12 of the periodic table). While tungsten is employed to provide the description of several embodiments below, any suitable first metal material may be utilized in the place of tungsten. According to another embodiment, the first metal material may comprise chromium. In another embodiment, the first metal material may comprise at least one of tungsten and chromium.",
                        "In one embodiment, the second metal material element may comprise, or be, an activator material, relative to the first metal material. In another embodiment, the second metal material may comprise, or be, a stabilizer material, relative to the first metal material. In one embodiment, the second metal material may comprise a metal element that is the same as, or different from, the first metal material. For example, the metal element of the second metal material may be a transition metal. In one embodiment, the second metal material may comprise Cr, Ti, or both. According to another embodiment, the second metal material may comprise Ni.",
                        "The nanocrystalline material may have any value of relative density, depending on the material. Relative density may refer to the ratio between the experimentally measured density of the nanocrystalline material and the theoretical density of the nanocrystalline material.",
                        "In one embodiment, the nanocrystalline material may be a bulk nanocrystalline alloy. A bulk nanocrystalline alloy may be a material that is not in the form of a thin film. For example, a bulk nanocrystalline alloy in one embodiment may refer to a material with a smallest dimension of at least about 1 micron\u2014e.g., at least about 10 microns, about 25 microns, about 50 microns, about 75 microns, about 100 microns, about 250 microns, about 500 microns, about 1 mm, about 5 mm, about 10 mm, or larger. In another embodiment, the nanocrystalline alloy is not in the form of a coating.",
                        "Stabilization Of Nanocrystalline Structure",
                        "A nanocrystalline microstructure with a high surface-to-volume ratio may have a large number of interfacial regions or grain boundaries, which may make it unstable. In one embodiment, instability may indicate a high amount of excess energy in the system, and significant grain growth may be observed in pure nanostructured materials even at room temperature. Not to be bound by any particular theory, but this phenomenon may be understood from a thermodynamic viewpoint. The Gibbs free energy, G, is proportional to the grain boundary energy, \u03b3, multiplied by grain boundary area, A. Therefore, the decrease in grain boundary area that occurs as a result of grain growth may bring the system into a lower energy state. This phenomenon, in one embodiment, is illustrated in FIG. 3(a).",
                        "dG\u221d\u03b3dA\u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "The high driving force for grain growth may limit further technological applications of pure nanostructured materials because even a small change in grain size over the service lifetime of the material may lead to a dramatic change in the material properties. Additionally, the propensity for grain growth may limit the amount of post-processing a nanostructured material may be subjected to, including consolidation and shape forming.",
                        "In one embodiment, two basic approaches may be used to stabilize nanocrystalline materials: a kinetic approach and a thermodynamic approach. The kinetic approach attempts to diminish grain boundary mobility to reduce grain growth. For example, grain boundary mobility may be limited by methods including second phase drag, solute drag, and chemical ordering. These strategies may postpone the time at which grain growth occurs. However, these methods may not reduce the driving force for grain growth. Thus, kinetically stabilized products may experience grain growth and may not provide constant performance throughout a service lifetime.",
                        "In contrast, the thermodynamic approach attempts to reduce the grain boundary energy by segregating solute atoms, thus reducing the driving force for grain growth. Not to be bound by any particular theory, but in alloy systems the grain boundary energy, \u03b3, may be described in terms of the solute concentration, cs, by the Gibbs adsorption equation:",

                        "where T is temperature, R is the gas constant, and \u0393s is the interfacial excess of the solute atoms. In the case of segregation, \u0393s>0, and thus \u03b3 will decrease with increasing solute concentration, cs. A nanocrystalline alloy may be in a metastable state if \u03b3 is close to zero at a specific solute concentration. From Equation (2), the total grain boundary energy is given by:",

                        "where \u03b30 is the specific grain boundary energy of the pure element, \u0394Hseg is the segregation enthalpy of solute atoms, k is the Boltzmann constant, and X is the solute concentration in the grain boundary. Stabilization of nanocrystalline material grain size by solute segregation may be conducted for Ni\u2014P alloys, Y\u2014Fe alloys, Nb\u2014Cu alloys, Pd\u2014Zr alloys, and Fe\u2014Zr alloys, among many others.",
                        "The new degree of freedom to Gibbs free energy produced by solute segregation is plotted in FIG. 3(a), showing a countertrend to classical grain boundary energy. The classical grain boundary energy modified by the solute segregation effect is depicted in FIG. 3(b). In one embodiment, this curve is different from the classical grain boundary energy curve, because it does not simply decrease but rather exhibits a minimum at a specific grain size. Thus, stabilized nanostructured materials with fine grain size may be produced by reducing the driving force for grain growth with solute segregation.",
                        "Nanocrystalline Tungsten",
                        "In one embodiment, nanocrystalline body-centered cubic metals may be desirable because these metals exhibit desirable properties, including localized shearing under high rate loading. The formation of shear bands under high rate loading may be beneficial for a material utilized in a kinetic energy penetrator device because it may allow more energy to be conveyed to the object to be penetrated by reducing the energy that is dissipated as a result of plastic deformation of the penetrator. In one embodiment, tungsten may be desirable as a prospective replacement for depleted uranium in kinetic energy penetrator applications because of its high density and strength. In addition, unlike tungsten with larger grain sizes, nanocrystalline tungsten may exhibit shear bands under high rate loading.",
                        "Two methodologies may be employed to manufacture nanocrystalline materials: bottom-up and top-down. The top-down strategy may refine a bulk coarse grain material into the nanoscale regime. The bottom-up method may employ nanosize particles followed by consolidation at high temperature.",
                        "One exemplary top-down method for refining the grain size of tungsten is severe plastic deformation (SPD). There are at least two typical SPD techniques: equal-channel-angular-pressing (ECAP) and high-pressure torsion (HPT). An ECAP process may result in a tungsten grain size of a few microns by initiating dynamic recrystallization and grain growth as a result of the high processing temperature of around 1000\u00b0 C. Therefore, a warm rolling process may follow an ECAP process to obtain a grain size in the ultra-fine grain regime. Another SPD processing method, HPT, applies high pressure and torsion to a disk of tungsten. The resulting plastic strain may yield a material with a grain size of about 100 nm. These SPD techniques may produce an ultra-fine grain size tungsten that may be perfectly plastic with no strain hardening, may exhibit a reduced strain rate sensitivity, and/or may exhibit localized shearing under high rate loading.",
                        "In some instances, problems may exist with the use of the SPD technique to produce ultra-fine grain size tungsten (or even finer grains). First, a large scale product is not produced through the SPD technique. In one embodiment, the SPD technique utilizes large amounts of energy per unit volume of material processed. Also, the fine grain size of the produced material may be lost if the material is subjected to subsequent processing (e.g., shape forming). Additionally, the SPD technique may not provide a scalable way to precisely control grain size, and thus may not produce a material with the specific grain size needed for a specific application. In one embodiment, the SPD technique does not reduce the driving force for grain growth.",
                        "In one embodiment of the bottom-up method, particles containing nanosize grains of the material may be synthesized, and then the particles may be consolidated. Thus, in one embodiment, this method herein may be referred to as a \u201ctwo-step\u201d process. The consolidation may be achieved by a sintering process. However, materials produced through the bottom-up method may exhibit poor ductility as a result of volume defects that are not removed during the consolidation step. These volume defects may include residual porosity, poor inter-particle bonding, and impurity contamination.",
                        "Bottom-up processes may be utilized to produce nanocrystalline tungsten. These processes may include the production of nanocrystalline tungsten powders synthesized through mechanical working, including ball milling and/or high energy milling. In some instances, although tungsten with nanosized grains of about 5 nm to about 15 nm may be produced, the resulting nanostructure may become unstable and may be susceptible to thermally activated grain growth. In one embodiment, to produce a tungsten material with a stable nanostructure, additive elements may be employed to reduce susceptibility to thermally activated grain growth. As described elsewhere herein, additive elements in one embodiment may be a stabilizer, an activator, or both, with respect to tungsten in the nanocrystalline alloy.",
                        "Elements for Stabilizing Nanocrystalline Tungsten",
                        "In selecting elements for stabilizing a tungsten material with nanosized grains, \u0394Hseg may be important. As shown in Eq. (3), elements with a large value of \u0394Hseg may reduce grain boundary energy. The \u0394Hseg of a solution may be directly related to the elastic strain energy of the solution, and the elastic strain energy of a solution may scale with atomic radius mismatch. Therefore, in one embodiment, as atomic radius mismatch increases, the grain boundary energy may be reduced.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 4, the slope of excess enthalpy may become more negative as the ratio of the atomic radius of the solute to that of the host atom increases, indicating an increased potential for grain boundary energy reduction with increasing atomic radius mismatch. Other factors that may be considered in selecting an element for the stabilization of tungsten include chemical interaction and grain boundary energy difference. In the case of elements with a positive heat of mixing, solubility may be directly related to chemical interaction, and solutes with high immiscibility with host atoms may be more likely to segregate to grain boundaries.",
                        "In considering the segregation strength of tungsten alloys with positive heats of mixing, the elements Ti, V, Sc, and Cr may have good segregation strength with respect to their enthalpies of mixing. In one embodiment, vanadium exhibits a low heat of mixing, and thus may not be desirable for certain applications.",
                        "The thermal stability of an alloy may be determined and/or confirmed by any suitable techniques. For example, in one embodiment, the thermal stability of a W\u2014Ti alloy may be confirmed with x-ray diffraction (XRD) data collected in-situ at different temperatures. The alloy sample may already have been annealed at various temperatures, for various predetermined periods of time. FIG. 5 shows the XRD data of a W\u2014Ti alloy after being annealed for 1.5 hours at various temperatures. As shown in FIG. 5, while the grain size of pure tungsten may increase at 1000\u00b0 C., the grain size increase in a W-17.5 at % Ti alloy may be suppressed. Therefore, not to be bound by any theory, but at least in this embodiment Ti may play a role in inhibiting grain growth by reducing the grain boundary energy.",
                        "Activated Sintering of Tungsten",
                        "Because tungsten has a high melting point of 3422\u00b0 C., tungsten may be employed as a refractory metal material. In one embodiment, even with sintering techniques, high temperatures of about 2400\u00b0 C. to about 2800\u00b0 C. may be needed to obtain a full density sintered tungsten material. Small amounts of additional elements may be added to tungsten to enhance the sintering kinetics, and in turn lower the sintering temperature. The additive elements may be metal elements, including any of those aforedescribed. In one embodiment, the additive elements may be at least one of Pd, Pt, Ni, Co and Fe. These additive metal elements may surround the tungsten particles and provide a relatively high transport diffusion path for the tungsten, thereby reducing the activation energy of tungsten diffusion. In one embodiment, this technique is referred to as activated sintering.",
                        "Activated sintering may be explained by different mechanisms. It may be ascribed to dislocation climb, the transfer of electrons from the additive element to the d-orbital of tungsten, and an enhancement of the grain boundary diffusion rate. The effect of additive elements that are transition metal elements on the sintering kinetics of tungsten are shown in FIGS. 6(a) and 6(b). In these figures, the degree of sintering may be reflected by the degree of shrinkage of the tungsten compacts under a constant force at an elevated temperature, with shrinkage correlating to the amount of sintering that has occurred. FIG. 6(a) depicts the amount of shrinkage for various monolayers of the additive elements on the tungsten particles, and FIG. 6(b) depicts the shrinkage of tungsten particles with four monolayers of different additive elements at different temperatures. In one embodiment, the use of Pd and Ni as additional elements may result in the activated sintering of tungsten. In another embodiment, the additive element Cu may have a minimal impact on the sintering kinetics and may result in the same linear shrinkage as pure tungsten, as shown in FIG. 6(b). Not to be bound by any theory, but this may be a result of the low solubility of tungsten in Cu, which low solubility may prevent Cu from providing a fast transport path to tungsten atoms during sintering.",
                        "Sintering Kinetics",
                        "While additive elements may be desirable in some instances, too much of an additive element may hinder the densification of tungsten. Not to be bound by any particular theory, but this may suggest that activated sintering of tungsten may be a diffusion controlled process. The activation energies of the additive elements Fe, Co, Ni, and Pd, are 480 kJ/mol, 370 kJ/mol, 280 kJ/mol, and 200 kJ/mol, respectively.",
                        "The activation energy of pure tungsten sintering is about 380-460 kJ/mol. Not to be bound by any theory, but the value suggests that the mechanism of sintering of pure tungsten in the initial stage may be grain boundary diffusion because the activation energy of pure tungsten sintering is comparable to that of grain boundary diffusion of tungsten as shown in Table 1.",
                        "Activation Energy for Densification",
                        "Sintering may be a complex process that includes the change of microstructure as a result of several different diffusion mechanisms. In one embodiment, this complex sintering process may be distinguished into three stages based on the evolution of the microstructure: initial, intermediate and final stage. The initial stage may begin at a low temperature when necks are created between particles. The necks may be created through surface diffusion and may result in a small increase in density. The initial stage may correlate to less than 3% linear shrinkage. The intermediate stage may produce considerable densification. The densification in the intermediate stage may be up to a relative density of 93%. During the final stage, isolated pores may be formed and then removed. In the final stage, volume diffusion may be predominant.",
                        "The sintering behavior may be explained by geometric models. While these models may be in line with experimental results in some cases, slight deviations from the geometric models, such as the use of non-spherical particles or a variety of particle sizes, may make the results of the geometric models unreliable. Moreover, geometric models based on the initial sintering process may not be accurate beyond the first 5% of linear shrinkage. In addition, the actual evolution of the microstructure of powder compacts may be different from the predictions of geometric models. As a result, it may be difficult to quantitatively predict sintering kinetics.",
                        "The entire sintering process may be described in an approach that focuses on more than the three sintering stages. To evaluate the precise activation energy of the sintering process, a generalized sintering equation may be utilized.

This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase \u201cat least one\u201d refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.
