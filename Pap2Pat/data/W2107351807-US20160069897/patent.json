                        "Antibody fragments offer many advantages over full immunoglobulin molecules when used as an active agent in a therapeutic regimen. For example, being of smaller size than their full size immunoglobulin counterparts, antibody fragments can achieve higher levels of tissue penetration when administered to a patient in need thereof, and therefore higher therapeutic efficacy than a larger immunoglobulin molecule of comparable antigen specificity. Further, due to this smaller size, antibody fragments are often more easily and economically producible than their full immunoglobulin counterparts of comparable antigen specificity.",
                        "Techniques for selecting and identifying antibody fragments such as heterodimeric Fab fragments include a number of display technologies. Ribosomal display is a cell-free system using the principle of coupling phenotype (protein) to genotype (encoding nucleic acid such a DNA or RNA) for the in vitro selection of proteins from large libraries (Mattheakis et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:9022-9026 (1994); Hanes et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94:4937-4942 (1997); He et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 25(24):5132-4 (1997)). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal display systems have been used for the selection of peptides, single-chain antibodies (e.g., scFvs), enzymes, stable protein scaffolds and other ligand-binding domains (He et al., Brief Funct. Genomic Proteomic, 1(2):204-12 (2002)). Efficient display methods for producing and selecting Fab fragment antibodies from very large libraries (e.g., between about 103 to 105 members, preferably 105 to 1016 members) are needed.",
                        "Despite the expressed suggestions in the prior art to avoid multichain assembly using ribosomal display systems (see, e.g., Simuda et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 37(22):e147 (2009); Ponsel et al., Molecules, 16:3675-3700 (2011)), it has been surprisingly found to work efficiently. Prior to our work, it was thought that the kinetics of chain association were too slow, relative to that of mRNA degradation, to permit selection of multichain proteins such as Fab fragments."

The method involves construction of nucleic acid libraries, formation of Fab fragment complexes from variable chain libraries (e.g., VH and VL libraries), and selection of Fab fragment complex that specifically binds a target antigen. The nucleic acid library (first library) can be made by synthesizing a DNA library of diverse sequences (of at least 102 members, e.g., from about 103 to about 105, from about 105 to about 1016) that are then transcribed to produce a pool of mRNAs. Ribosomal display in a cell-free protein synthesis system can be used to generate the encoded proteins, which can form Fab fragment complexes with a second library of variable chain domains. The Fab fragment complexes can be selected for binding to an immobilized target antigen. mRNA encoding the selected complexes can be used to make cDNA, which can then be amplified and the process may be repeated to enrich the population of coding sequences for Fab fragments of interest.",
                        "The open nature of completely in vitro selection technologies has been thought to preclude the direct selection of multimeric proteins such as Fabs (Sumida et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 37:e147 (2009); Ponsel et al., Molecules, 16:3675-3700 (2011)), which more closely resemble IgGs than scFvs, presumably because it has been thought that each protein chain must always maintain association with its own transcript. Provided herein is a novel approach for selecting large libraries of multimeric proteins such as Fabs that should apply to all completely in vitro selection technologies. This is achieved by simply maintaining the genotype-phenotype linkage for only one of the chains in a multi-chain protein."

The Fab fragment contains the antigen binding portion of the antibody called the paratope at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer. It is made up of a variable heavy (VH) chain and a dimer association with a variable light (VL) chain. It is composed of one or a portion of the constant domain and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of an antibody. The variable domain is also referred to as the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. More specifically, variable loops of \u03b2-strands, three each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 273 (4): 927-948 (1997), and more recently by North et al., J. Mol. Biol., 406(2): 228-256 (2010). In between the CDRs are the framework regions (FRs) which are relatively non-variable regions. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs in three dimensional space."

Ribosomal display is a well-known technology useful for generating libraries. This entirely in vitro method allows for libraries with a diversity of 1016 members. The process results in translated proteins that are associated with their RNA progenitor which can be used, as a complex, to bind to an immobilized target molecule in a selection step. The RNA-protein complex that shows high binding affinity can then be reverse transcribed to cDNA and their sequence amplified via PCR. The process also provides for repeated cycles of iteration or protein expression. In addition, nucleic acid mutations can be introduced efficiently into the selected nucleic acid library in subsequent cycles, leading to continuous DNA diversification and thus, protein evolution. The end result is a nucleic acid sequence that can be used to create tightly binding proteins (e.g., Fab fragments that specifically bind to the target antigen.",

                                "In some embodiments, the CFPS reaction mixture comprises the following associated cofactors: a template nucleic acid, such as DNA, that comprises a coding sequence (gene) of interest operably linked to at least one promoter and, optionally, one or more other regulatory sequences (e.g., a cloning or expression vector containing the gene of interest) or a PCR fragment; an RNA polymerase that recognizes the promoter(s) to which the gene of interest is operably linked and, optionally, one or more transcription factors directed to an optional regulatory sequence to which the template nucleic acid is operably linked; ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs); optionally, other transcription factors and co-factors thereof; ribosomes; transfer RNA (tRNA); other or optional translation factors (e.g., translation initiation, elongation and termination factors) and co-factors therefore; one or more energy sources, (e.g., ATP, GTP); optionally, one or more energy regenerating components (e.g., PEP/pyruvate kinase, AP/acetate kinase or creatine phosphate/creatine kinase); optionally factors that enhance yield and/or efficiency (e.g., nucleases, nuclease inhibitors, protein stabilizers, chaperones) and co-factors thereof; and; optionally, solubilizing agents. The reaction mix can further comprises amino acids and other materials specifically required for protein synthesis, including salts (e.g., potassium, magnesium, ammonium, and manganese salts of acetic acid, glutamic acid, or sulfuric acids), polymeric compounds (e.g., polyethylene glycol, dextran, diethyl aminoethyl dextran, quaternary aminoethyl and aminoethyl dextran, etc.), cyclic AMP, inhibitors of protein or nucleic acid degrading enzymes, inhibitors or regulators of protein synthesis, oxidation/reduction adjuster (e.g., DTT, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and/or their oxides), non-denaturing surfactants (e.g., Triton X-100), buffer components, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, etc. Components of CFPS reactions are discussed in more detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,338,789 and 7,351,563, and U.S. App. Pub. No. 2010/0184135, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.",
                                "Depending on the specific enzymes present in the bacterial extract, for example, one or more of the many known nuclease, polymerase or phosphatase inhibitors can be selected and advantageously used to improve synthesis efficiency.",
                                "Protein and nucleic acid synthesis typically requires an energy source. Energy is required for initiation of transcription to produce mRNA (e.g., when a DNA template is used and for initiation of translation high energy phosphate for example in the form of GTP is used). Each subsequent step of one codon by the ribosome (three nucleotides; one amino acid) requires hydrolysis of an additional GTP to GDP. ATP is also typically required. For an amino acid to be polymerized during protein synthesis, it must first be activated. Significant quantities of energy from high energy phosphate bonds are thus required for protein and/or nucleic acid synthesis to proceed.",
                                "An energy source is a chemical substrate that can be enzymatically processed to provide energy to achieve desired chemical reactions. Energy sources that allow release of energy for synthesis by cleavage of high-energy phosphate bonds such as those found in nucleoside triphosphates, e.g., ATP, are commonly used. Any source convertible to high energy phosphate bonds is especially suitable. ATP, GTP, and other triphosphates can normally be considered as equivalent energy sources for supporting protein synthesis.",
                                "To provide energy for the synthesis reaction, the system preferably includes added energy sources, such as glucose, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), carbamoyl phosphate, acetyl phosphate, creatine phosphate, phosphopyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-Phosphoglycerate and glucose-6-phosphate, that can generate or regenerate high-energy triphosphate compounds such as ATP, GTP, other NTPs, etc.",
                                "When sufficient energy is not initially present in the synthesis system, an additional source of energy is preferably supplemented. Energy sources can also be added or supplemented during the in vitro synthesis reaction.",

In some instances, CFPS is performed in a reaction such as the Cytomim\u2122 (cytoplasm mimic) system. The Cytomim\u2122 system is defined as a reaction condition performed in the absence of polyethylene glycol with optimized magnesium concentration. This system does not accumulate phosphate, which is known to inhibit protein system.",

In some embodiments, the energy substrate for the Cytomim system is pyruvate, glutamic acid, and/or glucose. In some embodiments of the system, the nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are replaced with nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs).",

The cell extract can be treated with DsbC in addition to FkpA and peptidyl peolyl isomerase. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and glutathione (GSH) can also be added to the extract at a ratio that promotes proper protein folding and prevents the formation of aberrant protein disulfides. In some embodiments, molecular chaperones such as DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL or GroES can be added to the CFPS reaction.",

A bacterial lysate derived from any strain of bacteria can be used in the methods of the invention. The bacterial lysate can be obtained as follows. The bacteria of choice are grown up to log phase in any of a number of growth media and under growth conditions that are well known in the art and easily optimized by a practitioner for growth of the particular bacteria. For example, a natural environment for synthesis utilizes cell lysates derived from bacterial cells grown in medium containing glucose and phosphate, where the glucose is present at a concentration of at least about 0.25% (weight/volume), more usually at least about 1%; and usually not more than about 4%, more usually not more than about 2%. An example of such media is 2YTPG medium, however one of skill in the art will appreciate that many culture media can be adapted for this purpose, as there are many published media suitable for the growth of bacteria such as E. coli, using both defined and undefined sources of nutrients. Cells that have been harvested overnight can be lysed by suspending the cell pellet in a suitable cell suspension buffer, and disrupting the suspended cells by sonication, breaking the suspended cells in a French press, continuous flow high pressure homogenization, or any other method known in the art useful for efficient cell lysis. The cell lysate is then centrifuged or filtered to remove large DNA fragments and cell debris.",

For example, the bacterial strain used to make the cell free extract can have mutations in the genes encoding the nucleases RNase E and RNase A. The strain may also have mutations to stabilize components of the cell synthesis reaction such as deletions in genes such as tnaA, speA, sdaA or gshA, which prevent degradation of the amino acids tryptophan, arginine, serine and cysteine, respectively, in a cell-free synthesis reaction. Additionally, the strain may have mutations to stabilize the protein products of cell-free synthesis such as knockouts in the proteases ompT or lonP.",

                                "This example illustrates a method for selecting a heterodimeric Fab domain by ribosome display using two templates: (1) a display template containing the Fab heavy chain (HC) fused to a TolA spacer without a stop codon, and (2) a complementary expression template containing the Fab light chain (LC) with a stop codon (FIG. 1A). The lack of a stop codon at the end of the display template forces stalling of the ribosome at the end of the HC mRNA transcript enabling formation of the ternary protein-ribosome-mRNA complex. The TolA spacer is a standard unstructured domain used in ribosome display which allows the nascent Fab HC to project from the exit tunnel and fold outside of the ribosome. The LC expression template contains a stop codon at the end of the transcript and lacks the TolA spacer since it is not intended to be displayed directly from the ribosome nor linked to its own mRNA transcript. Instead, co-expression of the LC enables heterodimerization with the displayed HC on the ribosome to yield the complete Fab-ribosome-HC mRNA ternary complex (FIG. 1B). Alternatively, the Fab can be linked to the LC mRNA by expressing the LC from the display template and its complementary HC from an expression template. In this manner, libraries of either the HC or LC can be screened in turn.",
                                "The HC display and expression templates were made by PCR of the Herceptin HC Fab plasmid using either the T7B/TolAk primers or T7B/HER2_FAB_HC_STOP! RP (Table 1), respectively. The LC display and expression templates were made by PCR of the Herceptin Fab LC plasmid using either the T7B/TolAk primers, or the T7B/Her2_FAB_LC_STOP! RP, respectively. All DNA templates were then purified with a Qiagen PCR purification kit. A total of 5 \u03bcL of a 3:1 mixture (based on mass) of the appropriate expression and display templates were added to 20 \u03bcL of pre-mixed PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit (NEB) containing 10 \u03bcL solution A, 7.5 \u03bcL solution B, 1 \u03bcL disulfide enhancer 1, 1 \u03bcL disulfide enhancer 2, 0.5 \u03bcL nuclease-free water (Ambion). The final concentration of the expression and display DNA templates were 300 ng/\u03bcL and 100 ng/\u03bcL, respectively. The coupled transcription/translation reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30\u00b0 C. The remaining selection was performed using standard protocols (Dreier and Pl\u00fcckthun, Methods Mol. Biol. 2011 687, 283-306) with 14 nM HER2/ErbB2 ECD (Creative Biomart) previously biotinylated. RT-PCR was performed using a 1-step Transcriptor RT-PCR kit (Roche) with T7B/TolAk primers (FIG. 1C). The RT-PCR product was sequenced using the TolA Internal RP which verified recovery of the displayed HC or LC protein fragment. These experiments suggest functional heterodimeric Fab domains can be displayed from the ribosome with either the HC or LC mRNA connected to its respective HC or LC protein.",
                                "In summary, this example illustrates that the formation of a ternary complex of the functional Fab, ribosome, mRNA complex using a mixture of a display template and its complementary expression template co-expressed in a cell-free translation mixture. For HC display, the HC display template was co-expressed with the LC expression template which enables selection of a HC library. Alternatively, co-expression of the LC display template with the HC expression template enabled LC display. In particular, the example shows that co-expression of both the Herceptin Fab HC and LC display and expression templates in either the HC or LC display format is required for significant recovery of the template following selection with HER2/ErbB2 extra-cellular domain (ECD). These results are consistent with the notion that functional heterodimeric Fabs can be assembled on stalled ribosomes.",

The Fab HC only library design was based on the published library (Lee et al., JMB, 340:1073-1093 (2004)) using the same limited diversity in CDRs H1 and H2. CDR H3 was restricted to a single loop length of 11 amino acids and 8 residues were randomized using NNK codons. The library was constructed using overlapping PCR as described below.",

T7B and TolAk primers have been previously reported (Dreier and Pl\u00fcckthun, Methods Mol. Biol., 687: 283-306 (2011)). Primer sets were mixed to give similar degeneracy as Lee et al. H1a For and H1b For primers were mixed at a 2:1 ratio to make a H1 For primer mix. H2a For, H2b For, and H2c For primers were mixed at a ratio of 1:2:0.1 to give a H2 For primer mix. H3a For and H3a For primers were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 to give H3 For primer mix. The complementary reverse primer sets were mixed separately at the same ratios. Four sets of PCR reactions were performed using (1) T7B/H1 Rev mix, (2) H1 For mix/H2 Rev mix, (3) H2 For mix/H3 Rev mix, and (4) H3F mix and Univ TolA RP. PCR was performed using 10 ng of the wild-type Fab HC ribosome display template and 0.5 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM primer stocks (about 3\u00d71013 molecules) using 2\u00d7HF Phusion polymerase master mix (NEB). The fragments were gel purified and mixed at equimolar ratios (about 3.7\u00d71012 molecules each) for overlapping PCR (18\u00d750 \u03bcL reactions). The assembled library was then amplified using T7B/TolAk primers (48\u00d750 \u03bcL reactions) which was then purified and concentrated using Zymo Research DNA Clean and Concentrator spin columns.",

It was determined that a bivalent binding model which is expected for a bivalent IgG fit the data better than simple 1:1 binding.
