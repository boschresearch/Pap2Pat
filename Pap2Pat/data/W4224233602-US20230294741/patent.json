For example, in some cases, each encoder 484 in the encoder stack may generate an encoding that contains information about which parts of the input 483 are relevant to each other. Moreover, the output of one encoder 484 may be passed on as an input to the next encoder 484 in the encoder stack. Accordingly, in some cases, the first encoder 484 in the encoder stack may generate a first encoding of the input 483 (e.g., the embedding of each individual portion of the input 483) while the next encoder 484 in the encoder stack may generate a second encoding of the first encoding.",

In doing so, the self-attention layer 485 enables the encoder 484 to generate a context-aware encoding of the input 483 where the encoding for each individual portion of the input 483 incorporates weighted values corresponding to the other portions of the input 483.
