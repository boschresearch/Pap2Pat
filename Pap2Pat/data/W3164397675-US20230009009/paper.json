    "abstract": "Glycogen Storage Disease 1a (GSD1a) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase-\u03b1). G6Pase-\u03b1 is critical for maintaining interprandial euglycemia. GSD1a patients exhibit life-threatening hypoglycemia and long-term liver complications including hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) and carcinomas (HCCs). There is no treatment for GSD1a and the current standard-of-care for managing hypoglycemia (Glycosade \u00ae /modified cornstarch) fails to prevent HCA/HCC risk. Therapeutic modalities such as enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy are not ideal options for patients due to challenges in drug-delivery, efficacy, and safety. To develop a new treatment for GSD1a capable of addressing both the life-threatening hypoglycemia and HCA/HCC risk, we encapsulated engineered mRNAs encoding human G6Pase-\u03b1 in lipid nanoparticles. We demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our approach in a preclinical murine model that phenotypically resembles the human condition, thus presenting a potential therapy that could have a significant therapeutic impact on the treatment of GSD1a.",

                "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are a class of rare genetic disorders characterized by failure to synthesize or breakdown glycogen due to enzyme abnormalities in glycogen metabolism1,2. Among them, glycogen storage disease type1a (GSD1a) (OMIM: 232200) is caused by the deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-\u03b1, encoded by the G6PC gene), a key enzyme that catalyzes the last step in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis3,4. G6Pase-\u03b1 is expressed in gluconeogenic organs, primarily in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine5. GSD1a is characterized by severe hypoglycemia, since G6Pase-\u03b1 plays a pivotal role at the junction between glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis6. The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to free glucose catalyzed by G6Pase-\u03b1 is a key step in releasing glucose from the liver into the bloodstream; consequently, the absence of G6Pase-\u03b1 causes GSD1a patients to suffer from life-threatening hypoglycemia during fasting7. As G6P is a metabolite at the crossroads of multiple metabolic pathways, accumulation of G6P leads to other metabolic imbalances such as lactic acidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, hypercholesterolemia, and steatosis8. Furthermore, glycogen buildup in liver and kidneys leads to hepatomegaly and nephromegaly, which are hallmarks of GSD1a7.",
                "The current standard-of-care for GSD1a relies on vigilant dietary management9: frequent feedings (every 4\u20136\u2009h) of uncooked or modified cornstarch10 and gastric drip feeding of glucose through the night (mainly used in young patients)11. However, any feeding/cornstarch interruptions or delays can result in serious complications leading to death and dietary management alone is only partially effective at preventing the accumulation of glycogen and other underlying metabolic abnormalities that lead to long-term hepatic and renal complications12. Long-term hepatic complications include hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) which, are observed in 75% of adult patients of which 10% are at risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)13\u201315. The only curative treatment option for these patients is liver/kidney transplantation16, which remains high-risk with long-term complications associated with chronic immunosuppression.",
                "To circumvent the high-risk associated with liver transplantation for GSD1a patients, not to mention the challenges associated with finding matched donors, several less-invasive alternatives are being pursued. Liver stem cell infusion restores metabolic parameters without complications, but its therapeutic effects are transient (lasting only for a few months)17,18. Several somatic gene therapies that use an array of viral vectors have shown some promise in correcting hypoglycemia and prevention of HCA in GSD1a animal models19\u201322 and one of these is currently being evaluated in humans23. However, the clinical application of these approaches is likely to be limited by the gradual loss of transgene expression over time, the potential risk of genotoxicity, and preexisting neutralizing antibodies24. In addition, due to its highly hydrophobic nature and localization in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, G6Pase-\u03b1 poses considerable challenges for protein purification and drug delivery, thereby impeding enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) as an option for GSD1a25.",
                "Restoration of protein function via delivery of mRNA to tissues offers considerable advantages over conventional methods. This platform can encode for any protein sequence of choice and utilizes the intracellular machinery for the production and proper cellular localization of the target protein for therapeutic or preventative benefit26\u201330 (Fig.\u00a01a, example provided for G6Pase-\u03b1 enzyme). Unlike viral vector-mediated gene delivery approaches, mRNA therapy corrects for protein function without modifying the genomic DNA31,32. Furthermore, the mRNA-dependent transient protein expression mitigates the risk of unintentional overdose due to constitutive and/or prolonged activation of protein function and the linear dose response observed with mRNA therapy may allow titrating an ideal dose for each patient, something not easily feasible with viral vector-mediated gene therapy29,30. Despite numerous benefits, the advancement of mRNA-based therapeutics in the clinic has been hampered by lack of efficient and safe delivery methods that can transport long chains of negatively charged nucleotides across the cellular membrane. Recent developments in the encapsulation of mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as delivery vehicles have enabled several proof-of-concept preclinical and clinical studies33,34. Furthermore, advances in mRNA chemistries have greatly improved safety profiles for non-immunostimulatory mRNA-based therapies35\u201337. The therapeutic potential of safe and efficacious re-dosing of our LNP technology has been demonstrated, in mouse models, for other liver metabolic diseases such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)38,39, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)40,41, Fabry disease42, and others43\u201345. These preclinical findings are particularly encouraging as they suggest that the mRNA therapeutic modality can restore intracellular or transmembrane proteins, which are considered undruggable by current ERTs.Fig. 1In vitro characterization of modified mRNA encoding hG6Pase-\u03b1.a Hypothetical model of hG6PC mRNA therapy. hG6PC mRNAs are delivered to liver via lipid nanoparticles. Once the mRNA is in the cell (hepatocytes) it is translated by the cellular machinery into a functional protein that is localized to the ER membrane (likely following a co-translational translocation model), resulting in an active G6Pase-\u03b1 enzyme. b Protein consensus screening by ortholog residue analysis.

                "In this report we evaluate the efficacy and safety of mRNA therapy for GSD1a following repeat dosing. Previous efforts centered on developing an mRNA-based treatment for GSD1a were limited to single-dose, proof-of-concept studies performed in mouse models of the disease, to assess the effects of the exogenously delivered mRNA on fasting blood glucose levels46. Importantly, given the need for chronic therapy for the treatment of this disease, herein we show that mRNA therapy can address both the life-threatening hypoglycemia, as well as the long-term high risk of HCA/HCC associated with this disease. Together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of LNP encapsulated mRNAs for GSD1a."

                        "To ensure effective mRNA performance in vivo, we optimized protein sequences as well as codon choices in the mRNA sequence (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We first performed a computer-aided bioinformatics search for consensus protein sequence and identified amino acid residues that are highly conserved among >100 mammalian orthologs (Fig.\u00a01b). The top ten out of a total of 20 G6Pase-\u03b1 protein variants derived from the bioinformatics analysis were individually evaluated for expression and enzymatic activity in HeLa cells. The G6Pase-\u03b1 protein variant, bearing the serine (S) to cysteine (C) substitution at position 298 (S298C), showed an improvement in expression levels and activity by >2-folds compared to wild type human G6Pase-\u03b1 (hG6Pase-\u03b1_WT) (Fig.1c). Therefore, we selected the S298C protein variant for further analysis. This finding is consistent with and supports previous studies by Zhang et al., which reported similar improvements in protein expression with the S298C variant47,48. Based on predicted topology analysis49, the S298C substitution falls within the eighth transmembrane domain of hG6Pase-\u03b1, downstream of residues R83, H119, and H17650, that are directly involved in hG6Pase-\u03b1 activity (see predicted topology, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01).",
                        "Next, we evaluated the subcellular localization of the exogenous hG6Pase-\u03b1_S298C variant protein. Co-localization of hG6Pase-\u03b1_S298C protein with calnexin (an ER marker) confirmed the proper ER subcellular localization of the variant (Fig.\u00a01d, top panels) and matched the co-localization pattern of the G6Pase-\u03b1_WT protein indicating that the S to C substitution at position 298 does not interfere with localization to the ER membrane. Also, using Mander\u2019s colocalization coefficient analysis, we confirmed that the hG6Pase-\u03b1 signals were significantly more overlapped with the ER marker (Calnexin) signals than that of the mitochondrial maker (Tom20), which was used as a negative control (Fig.\u00a01d, bottom panels). Together these data suggest that the modified hG6PC S298C mRNA expresses robust levels of hG6Pase-\u03b1 S298C protein within the appropriate subcellular compartment (i.e., ER).",
                        "In previous work, we have demonstrated the benefit of codon optimization for maximizing protein expression and activity38,40,51. We have employed a similar approach to further enhance protein expression of hG6PC mRNA sequence. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, codon-optimized (CO) hG6PC WT and S298C mRNAs resulted in overall higher expression and enzymatic activity both in Hep3B cells (Fig.\u00a02a) and in livers of WT (CD-1) mice (Fig.\u00a02b). Of note, in CD-1 mice, the combination of protein variant S298C and codon optimization (S298C_CO mRNA) resulted in a more significant improvement in both hepatic protein expression and enzymatic activity (Fig.\u00a02b).Fig. 2Effect of codon optimization on expression and activity of hG6PC mRNAs.a hG6Pase-\u03b1 protein expression (left panel) and enzymatic activity (right panel) of wild-type hG6PC (WT), codon optimized wild-type hG6PC (WT_CO), hG6PC_S298C (S298C), and codon optimized hG6PC_S298C (S298C_CO) mRNAs evaluated in Hep3B cells.

WT (CD-1) mice were i.v. administered with 1.0\u2009mg/kg of eGFP, hG6PC-WT or -S298C mRNA-LNP and sacrificed at 6, 24, 72, 168, or 336\u2009h (n\u2009=\u20094). Although the hG6PC S298C mRNA (transcripts, T1/2: 20\u2009h) was cleared rapidly from the liver (Fig.\u00a03a), hG6Pase-\u03b1 S298C protein expression (T1/2: 79\u2009h) peaked at 24\u2009h and was detectable up to 168\u2009h (7 days) (Fig.\u00a03b). Similarly, enzyme activity (T1/2: 74\u2009h) was maximum at 24\u2009h and continued for the lifetime of the protein (Fig.\u00a03c). Thus, the CO and protein engineered hG6PC mRNA sequence (S298C) resulted in higher hepatic hG6Pase-\u03b1 protein levels and enzymatic activity compared to the WT mRNA. Despite the increase in hG6Pase-\u03b1 hepatic protein levels and enzymatic activity, we did not observe any significant difference in the overall rate of clearance of the WT and S298C proteins (Fig.\u00a03b, c).Fig. 3Hepatic hG6PC mRNA and hG6Pase-\u03b1 protein and activity half-lives in wild-type mice.Wild-type (CD-1) male mice were i.v. administered with 1.0\u2009mg/kg of eGFP, hG6PC-wild type (WT), or codon-optimized hG6PC-S298C (hG6PC_S298C_CO) mRNA-LNP and sacrificed at 6, 24, 72, 168, 336\u2009h (n\u2009=\u20094/group/sacrifice time point). a hG6PC mRNA levels (hG6PC-WT and S298C mRNAs). b Hepatic protein levels in mice treated with eGFP mRNA, mRNA encoding hG6Pase-\u03b1 WT, or codon-optimized mRNA encoding hG6PC-S298C protein variant. c Hepatic enzymatic activity levels in mice treated with eGFP mRNA, mRNA encoding hG6Pase-\u03b1 WT, or codon-optimized mRNA encoding hG6PC-S298C protein variant.

Like GSD1a patients, the L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice are unable to convert glycogen into glucose, leading to severe hypoglycemia upon fasting52. These mice also present with other hallmarks of GSD1a including, hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and as they grow older, HCAs and HCCs53,54. Additional details pertaining to the background and the genotype of the strain can be found in the methods section.",
                        "Initially, in a dose-ranging study, four groups of L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u2009=5\u2009\u201310 per group) were injected i.v. with a single dose of either 1.0\u2009mg/kg of eGFP mRNA, or 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0\u2009mg/kg of hG6PC S298C mRNA. In addition, one control group of wild-type C57BL/6\u2009J mice (WT) received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fasting was initiated immediately after administration of the mRNAs, and blood glucose levels were monitored prior to mRNA administration/initiation of fast (0\u2009h) and at 2.5-, 6-, and 24-h post-mRNA administration/initiation of fast. As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, in contrast to eGFP mRNA treated mice, mice treated with hG6PC S298C mRNA showed significant improvement in fasting glycemia at all doses tested. Of note, blood glucose was above 60\u2009mg/dL (therapeutic threshold based on clinical observations) in mice that received hG6PC S298C mRNA at all doses tested. While the increase in fasting blood glucose was dose-dependent at 2.5-h post-fasting, the fasting glucose levels observed at 6- or 24-h post-mRNA administration/initiation of fast did not increase with increasing doses, suggesting an adequate physiological regulation of blood glucose during fasting to maintain blood glucose around 100\u2009mg/dL as in the WT mice (Fig.\u00a04a). Mice were euthanized at 24-h post-mRNA administration to evaluate liver morphology (Fig.\u00a04b, left panel), liver weight (Fig.\u00a04b, right panel), hG6Pase-\u03b1 protein (Fig.\u00a04c, left panel and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02, left panel) and enzymatic activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right panel), and hepatic biomarkers including glucose-6 phosphate (G6P) (Fig.\u00a04d, left panel), glycogen (Fig.\u00a04d, middle panel and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, top panel), and triglycerides (Fig.\u00a04d, right panel). As shown in representative liver images in (Fig.\u00a04b), livers of eGFP mRNA-treated L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice were enlarged, pale, and steatotic in appearance as compared to livers from WT mice. In contrast, livers of hG6PC S298C mRNA treated L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice more closely resembled livers of WT mice. In addition, total liver weight was reduced for all three dose levels (Fig.\u00a04b, right panel) which, as expected, correlated to a dose-dependent increase in hG6Pase-\u03b1 protein levels (Fig.\u00a04c, left panel and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02, left panel) and enzymatic activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right panel) as well as, an increase in hG6PC S298C mRNA in hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, bottom panel). Consistent with the above observations, treatment with hG6PC S298C mRNA at all three dose levels resulted in significant reduction in GSD1a hepatic biomarkers (glycogen, G6P, and triglycerides) compared to the eGFP-treated group (Fig.\u00a04d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, top panel). Treatment with hG6PC S298C mRNA also resulted in a robust decrease in serum triglycerides at all three dose levels tested, correlating with the reduction in hepatic triglycerides levels observed (Fig.\u00a04e).Fig. 4Single i.v. dose of hG6PC S298C mRNA-LNP restores euglycemia, as well as serum and hepatic biomarkers in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice.a Blood glucose levels following administration of hG6PC S298C mRNA-LNP in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice.

While the dosing regimen (weekly dosing) for maintaining euglycemia in the mouse model (Fig.\u00a05a; as indicated by therapeutic threshold of 60\u2009mg/dL or above) may seem impractical for clinical application, our expectation is that the necessary dosing frequency will be substantially lower, likely at 3-week intervals or longer, due to slower drug metabolism in humans vs. mice as determined by allometric scaling55\u201357.Fig. 5Repeat i.v. dose of hG6PC mRNA-LNP results in safe and effective restoration of euglycemia in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice.a Single-dose duration of action of hG6PC S298C mRNA-LNP (0.5 or 1.0\u2009mg/kg) administered i.v. in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice.

                        "Given the need of chronic administration of therapeutic hG6PC S298C mRNA to treat GSD1a patients, repeat dose studies were conducted to evaluate efficacy in the L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a05b). L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u2009=\u20097\u20139 per group) received five consecutive injections of either eGFP mRNA or hG6PC S298C mRNA administered every 10 (second dose) to 14 days (all other doses) for over a period of 8 weeks. The mRNA was dosed at 0.25\u2009mg/kg (Fig.\u00a05b). Based on the single-dose efficacy studies (Figs.\u00a04a and 5a), the 2.5-h post-fasting blood glucose level was determined to be equally predictive of efficacy as the longer 6-h post-fasting glucose level. Indeed, it has been suggested that a 5\u20136-h fast in mice may be comparable to an overnight fast in humans58. In the multidose study (Fig.\u00a05b), we have chosen to monitor blood glucose at 2.5-h post-fasting on days 0, 1, 4, 7, and 10 following administration of the mRNA. Consistent with observations from single dose studies (Figs.\u00a04a and 5a), hG6PC S298C mRNA-treated L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice had a pronounced improvement in fasting glycemia, in comparison with control mice receiving eGFP mRNA treatment (Fig.\u00a05b). Importantly, the improvement in fasting glycemia with hG6PC S298C mRNA was sustained over the course of the treatment and did not diminish with repeat dosing (Fig.\u00a05b)."

Initially, in order to demonstrate the abrogation of immune stimulation by mRNA through the use of modified nucleotides35\u201337, we assessed serum cytokine levels for interferon gamma (IFN\u0263), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Fig.\u00a05c, left to right) in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice that were euthanized 24\u2009h post-mRNA treatment from our dose-ranging study (Fig.\u00a05c). No increase in measured serum cytokines was observed at any dose level of hG6PC S298C mRNA tested. In addition to a lack of increase in cytokine levels, we also observed a tendency of improvement in liver enzymes (e.g., ALT) in the mRNA treated mice (Fig.\u00a05d). Of note, in the repeat dose study (Fig.\u00a05b) no significant increase in serum IFN\u0263, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 levels was observed in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with five consecutive doses of 0.5\u2009mg/kg of hG6PC S298C mRNA (Fig.\u00a05e). In the same study, we also measured antidrug antibodies (ADA). Importantly, no appreciable ADA response was observed in the serum of mice treated with hG6PC S298C mRNA (Fig.\u00a05f). Finally, no observed hypersensitivity (changes in body temperature, altered breathing and ruffled fir), mortality, body weight, and changes in behavior (i.e., loss of appetite and distress) was observed in treated mice (data shown for body weight) (Fig.\u00a05g). While additional safety studies performed in larger animal models (i.e., rats and nonhuman primates) are warranted for future clinical development, the above data suggest that hG6PC S298C mRNA may be well-tolerated under the conditions of these studies."

                        "Due to deregulated glucose homeostasis, over 75% of GSD1a patients develop long-term liver complications, such as HCAs13\u201315. HCA presents in patients over 25 years of age and in 10% of cases, HCA undergoes malignant transformation to HCC15. Unfortunately, while strict compliance to dietary therapy can address the life-threatening symptoms of GSD1a, it is often only marginally effective at preventing HCA/HCC. To evaluate the effect of hG6PC S298C mRNA on prevention of HCA/HCC, we induced HCC in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice by feeding them a high fat/high sucrose (HF/HS) diet using the protocol we have previously published54. We then treated the L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice, with ten doses (dosed at 0.25\u20130.5\u2009mg/kg) of hG6PC S298C mRNA or control eGFP mRNA administered every 1\u20132 weeks. While only one WT mouse (out of a total of 21 WT mice) developed a lesion, ~58% of the control L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice (16 out of 26) fed a HF/HS diet developed visible (macroscopic) HCA/HCC lesions (Fig.\u00a06a, left panel). Of note, several mice within this cohort developed more than one lesion per liver (Fig.\u00a06a, middle panel). In contrast, treatment with hG6PC S298C mRNA resulted in significantly fewer mice with visible lesions (8 out of 34 or ~23%) (Fig.\u00a06a, left panel) and significantly fewer visible hepatic lesions per mouse (Fig.\u00a06a, middle panel). Finally, overall tumor burden (determined by summing the area of each HCA/HCC lesion per liver sample) was reduced in the hG6PC S298C mRNA treated group vs. the eGFP mRNA treated group (Fig.\u00a06a, right panel). These observations were further confirmed by morphological (Fig.\u00a06b, top panels) and histological analysis of the representative liver sections from each cohort (Fig.\u00a06b, bottom panels). Moreover, HCA/HCC-related biomarkers (i.e., PKM2, \u03b2-catenin, and p62)54 (Fig.\u00a06c); and genes associated with cellular proliferation and HCA/HCC development (i.e., Tgfb1, Glul, and Ctnnb1)54 were also partially reversed with hG6PC S298C mRNA treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). In addition, alpha fetoprotein (AFP)\u2014a serum biomarker associated with GSD1a-related HCA/HCC development54\u2014was also partially reduced upon treatment with hG6PC S298C mRNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). Finally, as observed in the chronic dose study (Fig.\u00a05b), treatment with hG6PC S298C mRNA showed a significant positive effect on fasting glycemia throughout the course of the treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c, bottom panel). Collectively, these data suggest that chronic treatment of hG6PC S298C mRNA reduces the risk of HCA/HCC, a long-term complication with GSD1a by functional restoration of hepatic G6Pase.Fig. 6Effect of hG6PC S298C mRNA-LNP on prevention of hepatic adenomas in L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice.a Number of mice with tumors (left), number of tumors per mouse (middle), and tumor burden/area (right).

                "This is the first evidence that repeat administration in model mice of an mRNA-based therapy for GSD1a that appears to be well-tolerated and efficacious at improving both fasting-tolerance and hepatic lesions. In this study, we engineered chemically-modified, CO mRNAs encoding hG6Pase-\u03b1 and encapsulated them in LNPs to enable delivery to the liver. We show that the engineered mRNAs resulted in a hG6Pase-\u03b1 enzyme with increased expression and enzymatic activity compared to non-optimized mRNA sequences (Fig.\u00a01c). The protein translated from the engineered mRNAs was also directed to the proper subcellular compartment (endoplasmic reticulum) (Fig.\u00a01d). When injected in a liver-specific mouse model of GSD1a that recapitulates the hepatic phenotypes in patients, the optimized mRNAs resulted in restoration of fasting blood glucose levels (Fig.\u00a04a), normalization of several hepatic and serum biomarkers associated with GSD1a (Fig.\u00a04b, d, e). Importantly, repeat administration of the mRNAs was well-tolerated (Fig.\u00a05e\u2013g), resulted in the management of life-threatening hypoglycemia (Fig.\u00a05b), may reduce the risk of long-term hepatic complications (e.g., HCA/HCC) (Fig.\u00a06).",
                "A key consideration when developing a drug for GSD1a is that the drug must have a sustained therapeutic effect. This can be achieved by (1) permanent gene correction (e.g., via gene editing), (2) gene insertion (e.g., vectored gene therapy), or (3) repeat administration of a transient therapeutic over the course of the patient\u2019s life. While gene editing approaches remain the holy grail for treating monogenic diseases, they are still in the early stages of development and several recent studies have raised concern about unintended consequences59,60. Notably, early versions of gene editing technology seem prone to hundreds (or even thousands) of unintended, off-target mutations throughout the genome61. Many of these mutations are likely to be silent and pose minimal risk to the patient, however, the risk of deleterious edits cannot be discarded offhand, especially germ line changes.",
                "Gene therapy approaches have gained considerable momentum over the last 5 years62,63, with several approvals granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating various diseases, such as retinal dystrophy (LUXTURNA, Spark Therapeutics, Inc.), spinal muscular atrophy (ZOLGENSMA, AveXis, Inc.), and others64. Gene therapy has been successfully used to correct the pathologies associated with GSD1a in both mouse19\u201322 and dog models65, and is currently being evaluated in GSD1a adult patients23. However, clinical feasibility remains elusive primarily due to efficacy hurdles and the inherent risks associated with viral-based gene therapy. One limitation of gene therapy is known as the \u201cdilution effect\u201d, where the therapy becomes less effective over time due to the natural process of liver cell growth and regeneration66. The dilution effect is the reason why young patients (<5 years old) are, generally, not eligible for gene therapy applications. Moreover, in GSD1a, hepatocyte proliferation is elevated, further compounding the issue66. In addition, the efficiency of AAV transduction is low (~5\u201310% of hepatocytes can be transduced) limiting transgene expression and correction. Thus, more than 90% of hepatocytes are not corrected and are prone to tumorigenesis. Finally, due to preexisting neutralizing antibodies against viral vectors, which are present in >50% of the population (and likely higher in previously treated patients), repeat administration of AVV-based gene therapy is not ideal67. Thus, once treated, the patient may require a new vector serotype, eventually exhausting available options.",
                "Systemic mRNA therapy offers several advantages as a therapeutic alternative to gene therapy, including (1) efficient protein expression without the need to first enter the nucleus, (2) essentially no integration risk, and (3) amenability to repeat dose. This third advantage is key, since, unlike the reported sustained, long-term expression associated with gene therapy, protein expression via mRNA-mediated delivery is transient and, like protein-based therapeutics (e.g., ERT), requires long-term chronic dosing. Here we show that our GSD1a mRNA therapy was well-tolerated and effective when dosed repeatedly, with little-to-no evidence of an immune response against the human protein in the GSD1a mouse model (Fig.\u00a05e\u2013g).",
                "As discussed above, HCA/HCC is a long-term complication of GSD1a. The ability to restore G6Pase-\u03b1 activity is expected to significantly reduce the risk of developing HCA/HCC overtime. Towards this end, previous studies performed in mouse models of GSD1a have shown that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated G6PC gene transfer to either 2-week-old global G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice or adult L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice prevented HCA development68,69. While encouraging, the gene therapy approach was not able to abrogate preexisting tumors due to lack of expression of the virus in the adenoma lesions69. The authors went on to show that the viral transgene was under the control of glucocorticoid signaling which is impaired in the adenoma lesions, resulting in suppressed gene therapy mediated G6Pase-\u03b1 restoration. Because mRNA therapy is not regulated at the level of transcription, this mechanism is not at play here. While purely speculative, the expectation is that GSD1a mRNA therapy may, not only prevent de novo HCA/HCC development at the tumor developing stage, but also potentially reduce any preexisting tumor burden. Given the potential of GSD1a mRNA therapy to impact preexisting tumors, further studies in older mice with preexisting adenomas are warranted.",
                "In summary, we describe a potential treatment for GSD1a which may address both the life-threatening hypoglycemia and HCA/HCC risk, that appears both well-tolerated and effective with repeat dosing under the conditions of these studies. mRNA therapy may overcome many of the limitations of the current standard-of-care for GSD1a (uncooked cornstarch and modified cornstarch\u2014Glycosade\u00ae), as well as other treatment modalities. These data generated to date provide justification to continue developing mRNA therapy for the treatment of GSD1a. Finally, mRNA therapy has the potential to extend benefit to patients suffering from other metabolic enzyme deficiencies of the liver that are not amenable to current treatment modalities."

Briefly, a mouse line in the C57BL/6\u2009J background with two loxP sites flanking the G6PC exon 3 (B6.G6PC lox/lox) was generated and crossed with transgenic mice with liver-specific expression of CRE recombinase under the control of the serum albumin promoter fused to a ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (B6.SA CREERT2/w). To induce the excision of G6PC exon 3, the resulting B6.G6PC lox/lox.SAcreERT2/w male adult (6\u20138 weeks old) mice were injected intraperitoneally once daily with 100\u2009\u00b5l of tamoxifen (1\u2009mg/ml, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) for 5 consecutive days, to obtain L.G6pc\u2212/\u2212 mice. Male mice were housed for a minimum of 4 weeks following the tamoxifen treatment prior to enrolling in the studies. As previously reported, the 4-week period is sufficient to ensure that all mice harbor the gene deletion53. Control C57BL/6\u2009J male mice were also treated with similar tamoxifen injections to rule out any potential effect of tamoxifen in treatment outcome. Male mice were housed in the animal facility of Lyon 1 University under temperature controlled (22\u2009\u00b0C) conditions and with a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice had free access to water and standard chow diet. Fasted mice were provided with continuous access to water. All the procedures were performed in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the European Convention for the Protection of Laboratory Animals.

For the duration-of-action study, a two-sample t-test (two-sided) was used to compare the blood glucose level of eGFP mRNA treated group to that of hG6PC S298C mRNA treated groups over 14 days. The multiple testing was corrected by Bonferroni adjusted level of 0.005. Repeat dose study was also analyzed with a two-sample t-test (two-sided), comparing the blood glucose level of eGFP mRNA treated group to that of hG6PC S298C mRNA treated groups over 52 days.
