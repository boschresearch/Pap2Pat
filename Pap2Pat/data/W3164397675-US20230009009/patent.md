# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

Glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD-I), also known as von Gierke disease, is caused by an accumulation of glycogen in organs and tissues of the body. GSD-I can be divided into two major subtypes, including glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD-Ia, MIM232200) and type Ib (GSD-Ib, MIM232220). Chou et al., Liver Research, 2017, 1:174-180. GSD-I has an incidence of about 1 in 100,000. GSD-Ia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase or G6PC; EC 3.1.3.9), and accounts for about 80% of GSD-I cases. G6PC is a key enzyme that is necessary for glucose production that is expressed mostly in the liver, kidney, and intestine, and functions inside of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of cells. G6PC catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate late during gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Normally, as blood glucose levels fall in between meals, G6P is produced during the terminal step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the gluconeogenic organs (primarily liver, and also the kidneys and intestine) and it is hydrolyzed by G6PC to glucose and then released back into the blood. GSD-Ia is caused by mutation of the gene encoding G6PC that impairs the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze G6P. After a short fast of a few hours, individuals with GSD-Ia become hypoglycemic. G6P becomes elevated in cellular cytoplasm, which leads to an accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys, and impaired blood glucose homeostasis. The accumulation of glycogen promotes progressive hepatomegaly and nephromegaly. GSD-Ia patients can also develop other metabolic complications, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and lactic academia. Individuals with GSD-Ia can also develop longer term problems, including growth retardation, osteoporosis, gout, pulmonary hypertension, and renal disease. One long-term complication is the development of hepatic tumors in 75% of GSD-Ia patients over the age of 25 years old, of which, approximately 10% transform into malignant tumors.

GSD-1a is lethal during childhood if left untreated. The standard of care for GSD-Ia is strict diet control that involves the frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch, which often results in poor compliance with the dietary restrictions. Furthermore, dietary control fails to prevent the long-term metabolic complications associated with G6PC deficiency, and cannot prevent the long-term consequences of hepatocellular adenoma. Enzyme replacement therapy is not an option for subjects with GSD-Ia because of drug delivery challenges, and current virus-based gene therapy approaches to correct G6PC deficiency have yet to be successful. Currently, only a liver transplant is curative for GSD-Ia patients. As a result, new therapies to prevent or treat GSD-Ia are needed. In view of the significant problems associated with existing approaches for preventing or treating GSD-Ia, there is an unmet need in the art for improved GSD-Ia therapies.

## SUMMARY

The present disclosure provides messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD-Ia). The mRNA therapeutics of the invention are particularly well-suited for the treatment of GSD-Ia as the technology provides for the intracellular delivery of mRNA encoding glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase or G6PC) followed by de novo synthesis of functional G6PC protein within target cells. The instant invention features the incorporation of modified nucleotides within therapeutic mRNAs to (1) minimize unwanted immune activation (e.g., the innate immune response associated with the in vivo introduction of foreign nucleic acids) and (2) optimize the translation efficiency of mRNA to protein. Exemplary aspects of the disclosure feature a combination of nucleotide modification to reduce the innate immune response and sequence optimization, in particular, within the open reading frame (ORF) of therapeutic mRNAs encoding G6PC to enhance protein expression.

In further embodiments, the mRNA therapeutic technology of the instant disclosure also features delivery of mRNA encoding G6PC via a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system. The instant disclosure features ionizable lipid-based LNPs, which have improved properties when combined with mRNA encoding G6PC and administered in vivo, for example, cellular uptake, intracellular transport and/or endosomal release or endosomal escape. The LNP formulations of the disclosure also demonstrate reduced immunogenicity associated with the in vivo administration of LNPs.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The present disclosure provides mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD-Ia). GSD-Ia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting the ability to produce glucose, and individuals with GSD-Ia are typically hypoglycemic. GSD-Ia is caused by mutations in the G6PC gene, which codes for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase or G6PC). G6PC hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate late during gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Without G6PC, G6P and glycogen abnormally accumulate in the liver and kidneys, and glucose production is impaired, particularly after the individual with GSD-Ia has fasted for a few hours. mRNA therapeutics are particularly well-suited for the treatment of GSD-Ia as the technology provides for the intracellular delivery of mRNA encoding G6PC followed by de novo synthesis of functional G6PC protein within target cells. After delivery of mRNA to the target cells, the desired G6PC protein is expressed by the cells' own translational machinery, and hence, fully functional G6PC protein replaces the defective or missing protein.

One challenge associated with delivering nucleic acid-based therapeutics (e.g., mRNA therapeutics) in vivo stems from the innate immune response which can occur when the body's immune system encounters foreign nucleic acids. Foreign mRNAs can activate the immune system via recognition through toll-like receptors (TLRs), in particular TLR7/8, which is activated by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). In nonimmune cells, the recognition of foreign mRNA can occur through the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Immune recognition of foreign mRNAs can result in unwanted cytokine effects including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) distribution and a strong type I interferon (type I IFN) response. This disclosure features the incorporation of different modified nucleotides within therapeutic mRNAs to minimize the immune activation and optimize the translation efficiency of mRNA to protein. Particular aspects feature a combination of nucleotide modification to reduce the innate immune response and sequence optimization, in particular, within the open reading frame (ORF) of therapeutic mRNAs encoding G6PC to enhance protein expression.

Certain embodiments of the mRNA therapeutic technology of the instant disclosure also feature delivery of mRNA encoding G6PC via a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are an ideal platform for the safe and effective delivery of mRNAs to target cells. LNPs have the unique ability to deliver nucleic acids by a mechanism involving cellular uptake, intracellular transport and endosomal release or endosomal escape. The instant invention features ionizable lipid-based LNPs combined with mRNA encoding G6PC which have improved properties when administered in vivo. Without being bound in theory, it is believed that the ionizable lipid-based LNP formulations of the invention have improved properties, for example, cellular uptake, intracellular transport and/or endosomal release or endosomal escape. LNPs administered by systemic route (e.g., intravenous (IV) administration), for example, in a first administration, can accelerate the clearance of subsequently injected LNPs, for example, in further administrations. This phenomenon is known as accelerated blood clearance (ABC) and is a key challenge when replacing deficient enzymes (e.g., G6PC) in a therapeutic context. This is because repeat administration of mRNA therapeutics is in most instances essential to maintain necessary levels of enzyme in target tissues in subjects (e.g., subjects suffering from GSD-Ia.) Repeat dosing challenges can be addressed on multiple levels. mRNA engineering and/or efficient delivery by LNPs can result in increased levels and or enhanced duration of protein (e.g., G6PC) being expressed following a first dose of administration, which in turn, can lengthen the time between first dose and subsequent dosing. It is known that the ABC phenomenon is, at least in part, transient in nature, with the immune responses underlying ABC resolving after sufficient time following systemic administration. As such, increasing the duration of protein expression and/or activity following systemic delivery of an mRNA therapeutic of the disclosure in one aspect, combats the ABC phenomenon. Moreover, LNPs can be engineered to avoid immune sensing and/or recognition and can thus further avoid ABC upon subsequent or repeat dosing. An exemplary aspect of the disclosure features LNPs which have been engineered to have reduced ABC.

### 1. Glucose-6-Phosphatase (G6PC)

Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase or G6PC, EC 3.1.3.9) catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate (Pi) in the terminal step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. G6PC is primarily present in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and intestine. G6PC, encoded by the G6PC gene, is a multi-subunit integral membrane protein that resides on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and it hydrolyzes G6P to glucose and Pi in the ER lumen. The G6PC protein is 357 amino acids in length, with a molecular mass of about 40.5 kDa. It is composed of a catalytic subunit, and transporters for G6P, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and glucose. The amino acid sequence of human G6PC is provided in SEQ ID NO:199.

Normally, as blood glucose levels fall in between meals (fasting), G6P is produced during the terminal step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the gluconeogenic organs (primarily liver, and also the kidneys and intestine) and it is hydrolyzed by G6PC to glucose and then released back into the blood. More than 80 mutations in G6PC have been identified, and several mutations are known in GSD-Ia patients to impair the phosphohydrolase activity of the enzyme, thereby impairing glucose production. See, Chou et al., Liver Research, 2017, 1:174-180, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. After a short fast of a few hours, individuals with GSD-Ia become hypoglycemic. G6P becomes elevated in cellular cytoplasm, which leads to an accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys, and impaired blood glucose homeostasis. The accumulation of glycogen promotes progressive hepatomegaly and nephromegaly. GSD-Ia patients can also develop other metabolic complications, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and lactic academia. Individuals with GSD-Ia can also develop longer term problems, including growth retardation, osteoporosis, gout, pulmonary hypertension, and renal disease. One long-term complication is the development of hepatic tumors in 75% of GSD-Ia patients over the age of 25 years old, of which, approximately 10% transform into malignant tumors.

GSD-1a is lethal if left untreated. The standard of care for GSD-1a is strict diet control that involves the frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch. Currently, only a liver transplant is curative for GSD-Ia patients.

In certain aspects, the disclosure provides a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., a mRNA) comprising a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an open reading frame (ORF)) encoding a G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the G6PC polypeptide of the invention is a wild type full length human G6PC protein. In some embodiments, the G6PC polypeptide of the invention is a variant, a peptide or a polypeptide containing a substitution, and insertion and/or an addition, a deletion and/or a covalent modification with respect to a wild-type G6PC sequence. In some embodiments, the G6PC polypeptide of the invention is a truncated human G6PC protein. In some embodiments, sequence tags or amino acids, can be added to the sequences encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., at the N-terminal or C-terminal ends), e.g., for localization. In some embodiments, amino acid residues located at the carboxy, amino terminal, or internal regions of a polypeptide of the invention can optionally be deleted providing for fragments.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) comprising a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) of the invention encodes a substitutional variant of a human G6PC sequence, which can comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, tenor more than ten substitutions. In some embodiments, the substitutional variant can comprise one or more conservative amino acids substitutions. In other embodiments, the variant is an insertional variant. In other embodiments, the variant is a deletional variant.

G6PC protein fragments, functional protein domains, variants, and homologous proteins (orthologs) are also within the scope of the G6PC polypeptides of the disclosure. Nonlimiting examples of polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention are shown in SEQ ID NO:83, SEQ ID NO:84, SEQ ID NO:194-206, 208, and 209.

In some embodiments, the open reading frame is sequence-optimized. In particular embodiments, the invention provides sequence-optimized polynucleotides comprising nucleotides encoding the polypeptide sequence of human G6PC, or sequence having high sequence identity with those sequence optimized polynucleotides.

In certain aspects, the invention provides polynucleotides (e.g., a RNA such as an mRNA) that comprise a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding one or more G6PC polypeptides. In some embodiments, the encoded G6PC polypeptide of the invention can be selected from:

(i) a full length G6PC polypeptide (e.g., having the same or essentially the same length as wild-type G6PC; e.g., wild type human G6PC);

(ii) a functional fragment of G6PC described herein (e.g., a truncated (e.g., deletion of carboxy, amino terminal, or internal regions) sequence shorter than G6PC; but still retaining G6PC enzymatic activity);

(iii) a variant thereof (e.g., full length or truncated G6PC proteins in which one or more amino acids (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more amino acids) have been replaced, e.g., variants that retain all or most of the G6PC activity of the polypeptide with respect to a reference protein (such as any natural or artificial variants known in the art)); or

(iv) a fusion protein comprising (i) a full length G6PC protein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:199), a functional fragment or a variant thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:194-198, 200-206, 208, and 209), and (ii) a heterologous protein.

In certain embodiments, the encoded G6PC polypeptide is a mammalian G6PC polypeptide, such as a human G6PC polypeptide, a functional fragment or a variant thereof.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention increases G6PC protein expression levels and/or detectable G6PC enzymatic activity levels in cells when introduced in those cells, e.g., by at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100%, compared to G6PC protein expression levels and/or detectable G6PC enzymatic activity levels in the cells prior to the administration of the polynucleotide of the invention. G6PC protein expression levels and/or G6PC enzymatic activity can be measured according to methods know in the art. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is introduced to the cells in vitro. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is introduced to the cells in vivo.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprise a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) that encodes a wild-type human G6PC, e.g., (SEQ ID NO:199) or a variant thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:194-198, 200-206, 208, and 209).

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprises a codon optimized nucleic acid sequence, wherein the open reading frame (ORF) of the codon optimized nucleic acid sequence is derived from a wild-type G6PC sequence (e.g., wild-type human G6PC). For example, for polynucleotides of invention comprising a sequence optimized ORF encoding G6PC, the corresponding wild type sequence is the native human G6PC. Similarly, for a sequence optimized mRNA encoding a functional variant or fragment of human G6PC, the corresponding wild type sequence is the corresponding variant or fragment from human G6PC.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding G6PC having the full-length sequence of human G6PC (i.e., including the initiator methionine).

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprise a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding a mutant G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention comprise an ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide that comprises at least one-point mutation (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more point mutations) in the G6PC amino acid sequence and retains G6PC enzymatic activity. In some embodiments, the mutant G6PC polypeptide has a G6PC activity which is at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% of the G6PC activity of the corresponding wild-type G6PC (i.e., the same G6PC polypeptide but without the mutation(s)). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprising an ORF encoding a mutant G6PC polypeptide is sequence optimized.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) that encodes a G6PC polypeptide with mutations that do not alter G6PC enzymatic activity. Such mutant G6PC polypeptides can be referred to as function-neutral. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises an ORF that encodes a mutant G6PC polypeptide comprising one or more function-neutral point mutations.

In some embodiments, the mutant G6PC polypeptide has higher G6PC enzymatic activity than the corresponding wild-type G6PC. In some embodiments, the mutant G6PC polypeptide has a G6PC activity that is at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% higher than the activity of the corresponding wild-type G6PC (i.e., the same G6PC protein but without the mutation(s)).

In some embodiments, the G6PC fragment has a G6PC activity which is at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% of the G6PC activity of the corresponding full length G6PC.

One such feature that aids in protein trafficking is the signal sequence, or targeting sequence. The peptides encoded by these signal sequences are known by a variety of names, including targeting peptides, transit peptides, and signal peptides. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) comprises a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) that encodes a signal peptide operably linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes a G6PC polypeptide described herein.

In some embodiments, the “signal sequence” or “signal peptide” is a polynucleotide or polypeptide, respectively, which is from about 30-210, e.g., about 45-80 or 15-60 nucleotides (e.g., about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 amino acids) in length that, optionally, is incorporated at the 5′ (or N-terminus) of the coding region or the polypeptide, respectively.

In certain embodiments, the linker is selected from the group consisting of F2A linker, P2A linker, T2A linker, E2A linker, and combinations thereof. This family of self-cleaving peptide linkers, referred to as 2A peptides, has been described in the art (see for example, Kim, J. H. et al. (2011) PLoS ONE 6:e18556). In certain embodiments, the linker is an F2A linker. In certain embodiments, the linker is a GGGS (SEQ ID NO: 216) linker. In certain embodiments, the linker is a (GGGS)n (SEQ ID NO: 190) linker, wherein n=2, 3,4, or 5. In certain embodiments, the multimer construct contains three domains with intervening linkers, having the structure: domain-linker-domain-linker-domain e.g., G6PC domain-linker-G6PC domain-linker-G6PC domain.

In one embodiment, the cleavable linker is an F2A linker (e.g., having the amino acid sequence GSGVKQTLNFDLLKLAGDVESNPGP (SEQ ID NO:186)). In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is a T2A linker (e.g., having the amino acid sequence GSGEGRGSLLTCGDVEENPGP (SEQ ID NO:187)), a P2A linker (e.g., having the amino acid sequence GSGATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP (SEQ ID NO:188)) or an E2A linker (e.g., having the amino acid sequence GSGQCTNYALLKLAGDVESNPGP (SEQ ID NO:189)). The skilled artisan will appreciate that other art-recognized linkers may be suitable for use in the constructs of the invention (e.g., encoded by the polynucleotides of the invention). The skilled artisan will likewise appreciate that other multi-cistronic constructs may be suitable for use in the invention. In exemplary embodiments, the construct design yields approximately equimolar amounts of intrabody and/or domain thereof encoded by the constructs of the invention.

In one embodiment, the self-cleaving peptide may be, but is not limited to, a 2A peptide. A variety of 2A peptides are known and available in the art and may be used, including e.g., the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide, the equine rhinitis A virus 2A peptide, the Thosea asigna virus 2A peptide, and the porcine teschovirus-1 2A peptide. 2A peptides are used by several viruses to generate two proteins from one transcript by ribosome-skipping, such that a normal peptide bond is impaired at the 2A peptide sequence, resulting in two discontinuous proteins being produced from one translation event. As a non-limiting example, the 2A peptide may have the protein sequence of SEQ ID NO: 188, fragments or variants thereof. In one embodiment, the 2A peptide cleaves between the last glycine and last proline. As another non-limiting example, the polynucleotides of the present invention may include a polynucleotide sequence encoding the 2A peptide having the protein sequence of fragments or variants of SEQ ID NO: 188. One example of a polynucleotide sequence encoding the 2A peptide is: GGAAGCGGAGCUACUAACUUCAGCCUGCUGAAGCAGGCUGGAGACGU GGAGGAGAACCCUGGACCU (SEQ ID NO:191). In one illustrative embodiment, a 2A peptide is encoded by the following sequence: 5′-UCCGGACUCAGAUCCGGGGAUCUCAAAAUUGUCGCUCCUGUCAAACAA ACUCUUAACUUUGAUUUACUCAAACUGGCTGGGGAUGUAGAAAGCAAU CCAGGTCCACUC-3′(SEQ ID NO: 192). The polynucleotide sequence of the 2A peptide may be modified or codon optimized by the methods described herein and/or are known in the art.

In one embodiment, this sequence may be used to separate the coding regions of two or more polypeptides of interest. As a non-limiting example, the sequence encoding the F2A peptide may be between a first coding region A and a second coding region B (A-F2Apep-B). The presence of the F2A peptide results in the cleavage of the one long protein between the glycine and the proline at the end of the F2A peptide sequence (NPGP (SEQ ID NO:224) is cleaved to result in NPG and P) thus creating separate protein A (with 21 amino acids of the F2A peptide attached, ending with NPG) and separate protein B (with 1 amino acid, P, of the F2A peptide attached). Likewise, for other 2A peptides (P2A, T2A and E2A), the presence of the peptide in a long protein results in cleavage between the glycine and proline at the end of the 2A peptide sequence (NPGP (SEQ ID NO:224) is cleaved to result in NPG and P). Protein A and protein B may be the same or different peptides or polypeptides of interest (e.g., a G6PC polypeptide such as full length human G6PCor a truncated version thereof).

### 5. Sequence Optimization of Nucleotide Sequence Encoding a G6PC Polypeptide

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention is sequence optimized. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding a G6PC polypeptide, optionally, a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding another polypeptide of interest, a 5′-UTR, a 3′-UTR, the 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR optionally comprising at least one microRNA binding site, optionally a nucleotide sequence encoding a linker, a polyA tail, or any combination thereof), in which the ORF(s) are sequence optimized.

A sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence, e.g., a codon-optimized mRNA sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide, is a sequence comprising at least one synonymous nucleobase substitution with respect to a reference sequence (e.g., a wild type nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide).

A sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence can be partially or completely different in sequence from the reference sequence. For example, a reference sequence encoding polyserine uniformly encoded by UCU codons can be sequence-optimized by having 100% of its nucleobases substituted (for each codon, U in position 1 replaced by A, C in position 2 replaced by G, and U in position 3 replaced by C) to yield a sequence encoding polyserine which would be uniformly encoded by AGC codons. The percentage of sequence identity obtained from a global pairwise alignment between the reference polyserine nucleic acid sequence and the sequence-optimized polyserine nucleic acid sequence would be 0%. However, the protein products from both sequences would be 100% identical.

Some sequence optimization (also sometimes referred to codon optimization) methods are known in the art (and discussed in more detail below) and can be useful to achieve one or more desired results. These results can include, e.g., matching codon frequencies in certain tissue targets and/or host organisms to ensure proper folding; biasing G/C content to increase mRNA stability or reduce secondary structures; minimizing tandem repeat codons or base runs that can impair gene construction or expression; customizing transcriptional and translational control regions; inserting or removing protein trafficking sequences; removing/adding post translation modification sites in an encoded protein (e.g., glycosylation sites); adding, removing or shuffling protein domains; inserting or deleting restriction sites; modifying ribosome binding sites and mRNA degradation sites; adjusting translational rates to allow the various domains of the protein to fold properly; and/or reducing or eliminating problem secondary structures within the polynucleotide. Sequence optimization tools, algorithms and services are known in the art, non-limiting examples include services from GeneArt (Life Technologies), DNA2.0 (Menlo Park Calif.) and/or proprietary methods.

Codon options for each amino acid are given in TABLE 1.

Such properties include, but are not limited to, improving nucleic acid stability (e.g., mRNA stability), increasing translation efficacy in the target tissue, reducing the number of truncated proteins expressed, improving the folding or prevent misfolding of the expressed proteins, reducing toxicity of the expressed products, reducing cell death caused by the expressed products, increasing and/or decreasing protein aggregation.

In some embodiments, the sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) is codon optimized for expression in human subjects, having structural and/or chemical features that avoid one or more of the problems in the art, for example, features which are useful for optimizing formulation and delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics while retaining structural and functional integrity; overcoming a threshold of expression; improving expression rates; half-life and/or protein concentrations; optimizing protein localization; and avoiding deleterious bio-responses such as the immune response and/or degradation pathways.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention comprise a nucleotide sequence (e.g., a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding a G6PC polypeptide, a nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF) encoding another polypeptide of interest, a 5′-UTR, a 3′-UTR, a microRNA binding site, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a linker, or any combination thereof) that is sequence-optimized according to a method comprising:

(i) substituting at least one codon in a reference nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide) with an alternative codon to increase or decrease uridine content to generate a uridine-modified sequence;

(ii) substituting at least one codon in a reference nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide) with an alternative codon having a higher codon frequency in the synonymous codon set;

(iii) substituting at least one codon in a reference nucleotide sequence (e.g., an ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide) with an alternative codon to increase G/C content; or

Features, which can be considered beneficial in some embodiments of the invention, can be encoded by or within regions of the polynucleotide and such regions can be upstream (5′) to, downstream (3′) to, or within the region that encodes the G6PC polypeptide. These regions can be incorporated into the polynucleotide before and/or after sequence-optimization of the protein encoding region or open reading frame (ORF). Examples of such features include, but are not limited to, untranslated regions (UTRs), microRNA sequences, Kozak sequences, oligo(dT) sequences, poly-A tail, and detectable tags and can include multiple cloning sites that can have XbaI recognition.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention comprises a 5′ UTR, a 3′ UTR and/or a microRNA binding site. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises two or more 5′ UTRs and/or 3′ UTRs, which can be the same or different sequences. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises two or more microRNA binding sites, which can be the same or different sequences. Any portion of the 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR, and/or microRNA binding site, including none, can be sequence-optimized and can independently contain one or more different structural or chemical modifications, before and/or after sequence optimization.

In some embodiments, after optimization, the polynucleotide is reconstituted and transformed into a vector such as, but not limited to, plasmids, viruses, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. For example, the optimized polynucleotide can be reconstituted and transformed into chemically competent E. coli, yeast, neurospora, maize, drosophila, etc. where high copy plasmid-like or chromosome structures occur by methods described herein.

### 6. Sequence-Optimized Nucleotide Sequences Encoding G6PC Polypeptides

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention comprises a sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention comprises an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a G6PC polypeptide, wherein the ORF has been sequence optimized.

The sequence-optimized nucleotide sequences disclosed herein are distinct from the corresponding wild type nucleotide acid sequences and from other known sequence-optimized nucleotide sequences, e.g., these sequence-optimized nucleic acids have unique compositional characteristics.

In some embodiments, the percentage of uracil or thymine nucleobases in a sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence (e.g., encoding a G6PC polypeptide, a functional fragment, or a variant thereof) is modified (e.g., reduced) with respect to the percentage of uracil or thymine nucleobases in the reference wild-type nucleotide sequence. Such a sequence is referred to as a uracil-modified or thymine-modified sequence. The percentage of uracil or thymine content in a nucleotide sequence can be determined by dividing the number of uracils or thymines in a sequence by the total number of nucleotides and multiplying by 100.

Codon optimization, in some embodiments, may be used to match codon frequencies in target and host organisms to ensure proper folding; bias GC content to increase mRNA stability or reduce secondary structures; minimize tandem repeat codons or base runs that may impair gene construction or expression; customize transcriptional and translational control regions; insert or remove protein trafficking sequences; remove/add post translation modification sites in encoded protein (e.g., glycosylation sites); add, remove or shuffle protein domains; insert or delete restriction sites; modify ribosome binding sites and mRNA degradation sites; adjust translational rates to allow the various domains of the protein to fold properly; or reduce or eliminate problem secondary structures within the polynucleotide. Codon optimization tools, algorithms and services are known in the art—non-limiting examples include services from GeneArt (Life Technologies), DNA2.0 (Menlo Park Calif.) and/or proprietary methods. In some embodiments, the open reading frame (ORF) sequence is optimized using optimization algorithms.

### 7. Characterization of Sequence Optimized Nucleic Acids

In some embodiments of the invention, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) comprising a sequence optimized nucleic acid disclosed herein encoding a G6PC polypeptide can be tested to determine whether at least one nucleic acid sequence property (e.g., stability when exposed to nucleases) or expression property has been improved with respect to the non-sequence optimized nucleic acid.

As used herein, “expression property” refers to a property of a nucleic acid sequence either in vivo (e.g., translation efficacy of a synthetic mRNA after administration to a subject in need thereof) or in vitro (e.g., translation efficacy of a synthetic mRNA tested in an in vitro model system). Expression properties include but are not limited to the amount of protein produced by an mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide after administration, and the amount of soluble or otherwise functional protein produced. In some embodiments, sequence optimized nucleic acids disclosed herein can be evaluated according to the viability of the cells expressing a protein encoded by a sequence optimized nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) encoding a G6PC polypeptide disclosed herein.

In a particular embodiment, a plurality of sequence optimized nucleic acids disclosed herein (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) containing codon substitutions with respect to the non-optimized reference nucleic acid sequence can be characterized functionally to measure a property of interest, for example an expression property in an in vitro model system, or in vivo in a target tissue or cell.

a. Optimization of Nucleic Acid Sequence Intrinsic Properties

In some embodiments of the invention, the desired property of the polynucleotide is an intrinsic property of the nucleic acid sequence. For example, the nucleotide sequence (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) can be sequence optimized for in vivo or in vitro stability. In some embodiments, the nucleotide sequence can be sequence optimized for expression in a particular target tissue or cell. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence is sequence optimized to increase its plasma half-life by preventing its degradation by endo and exonucleases.

In other embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence is sequence optimized to increase its resistance to hydrolysis in solution, for example, to lengthen the time that the sequence optimized nucleic acid or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the sequence optimized nucleic acid can be stored under aqueous conditions with minimal degradation.

In other embodiments, the sequence optimized nucleic acid can be optimized to increase its resistance to hydrolysis in dry storage conditions, for example, to lengthen the time that the sequence optimized nucleic acid can be stored after lyophilization with minimal degradation.

b. Nucleic Acids Sequence Optimized for Protein Expression

In some embodiments of the invention, the desired property of the polynucleotide is the level of expression of a G6PC polypeptide encoded by a sequence optimized sequence disclosed herein. Protein expression levels can be measured using one or more expression systems. In some embodiments, expression can be measured in cell culture systems, e.g., CHO cells or HEK293 cells. In some embodiments, expression can be measured using in vitro expression systems prepared from extracts of living cells, e.g., rabbit reticulocyte lysates, or in vitro expression systems prepared by assembly of purified individual components. In other embodiments, the protein expression is measured in an in vivo system, e.g., mouse, rabbit, monkey, etc.

In some embodiments, protein expression in solution form can be desirable. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a reference sequence can be sequence optimized to yield a sequence optimized nucleic acid sequence having optimized levels of expressed proteins in soluble form. Levels of protein expression and other properties such as solubility, levels of aggregation, and the presence of truncation products (i.e., fragments due to proteolysis, hydrolysis, or defective translation) can be measured according to methods known in the art, for example, using electrophoresis (e.g., native or SDS-PAGE) or chromatographic methods (e.g., HPLC, size exclusion chromatography, etc.).

c. Optimization of Target Tissue or Target Cell Viability

In some embodiments, the expression of heterologous therapeutic proteins encoded by a nucleic acid sequence can have deleterious effects in the target tissue or cell, reducing protein yield, or reducing the quality of the expressed product (e.g., due to the presence of protein fragments or precipitation of the expressed protein in inclusion bodies), or causing toxicity.

Accordingly, in some embodiments of the invention, the sequence optimization of a nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein, e.g., a nucleic acid sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide, can be used to increase the viability of target cells expressing the protein encoded by the sequence optimized nucleic acid.

Heterologous protein expression can also be deleterious to cells transfected with a nucleic acid sequence for autologous or heterologous transplantation. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present disclosure the sequence optimization of a nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein can be used to increase the viability of target cells expressing the protein encoded by the sequence optimized nucleic acid sequence. Changes in cell or tissue viability, toxicity, and other physiological reaction can be measured according to methods known in the art.

d. Reduction of Immune and/or Inflammatory Response

In some cases, the administration of a sequence optimized nucleic acid encoding G6PC polypeptide or a functional fragment thereof can trigger an immune response, which could be caused by (i) the therapeutic agent (e.g., an mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide), or (ii) the expression product of such therapeutic agent (e.g., the G6PC polypeptide encoded by the mRNA), or (iv) a combination thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present disclosure the sequence optimization of nucleic acid sequence (e.g., an mRNA) disclosed herein can be used to decrease an immune or inflammatory response triggered by the administration of a nucleic acid encoding a G6PC polypeptide or by the expression product of G6PC encoded by such nucleic acid.

In some aspects, an inflammatory response can be measured by detecting increased levels of one or more inflammatory cytokines using methods known in the art, e.g., ELISA. The term “inflammatory cytokine” refers to cytokines that are elevated in an inflammatory response. Examples of inflammatory cytokines include interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; also known as GROα, interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The term inflammatory cytokines includes also other cytokines associated with inflammatory responses known in the art, e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-13 (Il-13), interferon α (IFN-α), etc.

### 8. Modified Nucleotide Sequences Encoding G6PC Polypeptides

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) of the invention comprises a chemically modified nucleobase, for example, a chemically modified uracil, e.g., pseudouracil, N1-methylpseudouracil, 5-methoxyuracil, or the like. In some embodiments, the mRNA is a uracil-modified sequence comprising an ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide, wherein the mRNA comprises a chemically modified nucleobase, for example, a chemically modified uracil, e.g., pseudouracil, N1-methylpseudouracil, or 5-methoxyuracil.

In certain aspects of the invention, when the modified uracil base is connected to a ribose sugar, as it is in polynucleotides, the resulting modified nucleoside or nucleotide is referred to as modified uridine. In some embodiments, uracil in the polynucleotide is at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or about 100% modified uracil. In one embodiment, uracil in the polynucleotide is at least 95% modified uracil. In another embodiment, uracil in the polynucleotide is 100% modified uracil.

In embodiments where uracil in the polynucleotide is at least 95% modified uracil overall uracil content can be adjusted such that an mRNA provides suitable protein expression levels while inducing little to no immune response. In some embodiments, the uracil content of the ORF is between about 100% and about 150%, between about 100% and about 110%, between about 105% and about 115%, between about 110% and about 120%, between about 115% and about 125%, between about 120% and about 130%, between about 125% and about 135%, between about 130% and about 140%, between about 135% and about 145%, between about 140% and about 150% of the theoretical minimum uracil content in the corresponding wild-type ORF (% UTM). In other embodiments, the uracil content of the ORF is between about 121% and about 136% or between 123% and 134% of the % UTM. In some embodiments, the uracil content of the ORF encoding a G6PC polypeptide is about 115%, about 120%, about 125%, about 130%, about 135%, about 140%, about 145%, or about 150% of the % UTM. In this context, the term “uracil” can refer to modified uracil and/or naturally occurring uracil.

In some embodiments, the uracil content in the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide of the invention is less than about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, or about 10% of the total nucleobase content in the ORF. In some embodiments, the uracil content in the ORF is between about 10% and about 20% of the total nucleobase content in the ORF. In other embodiments, the uracil content in the ORF is between about 10% and about 25% of the total nucleobase content in the ORF. In one embodiment, the uracil content in the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide is less than about 20% of the total nucleobase content in the open reading frame. In this context, the term “uracil” can refer to modified uracil and/or naturally occurring uracil.

In further embodiments, the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide having modified uracil and adjusted uracil content has increased Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), or Guanine/Cytosine (G/C) content (absolute or relative). In some embodiments, the overall increase in C, G, or G/C content (absolute or relative) of the ORF is at least about 2%, at least about 3%, at least about 4%, at least about 5%, at least about 6%, at least about 7%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 100% relative to the G/C content (absolute or relative) of the wild-type ORF. In some embodiments, the G, the C, or the G/C content in the ORF is less than about 100%, less than about 90%, less than about 85%, or less than about 80% of the theoretical maximum G, C, or G/C content of the corresponding wild type nucleotide sequence encoding the G6PC polypeptide (% GTMX; % CTMX, or % G/GTMX). In some embodiments, the increases in G and/or C content (absolute or relative) described herein can be conducted by replacing synonymous codons with low G, C, or G/C content with synonymous codons having higher G, C, or G/C content. In other embodiments, the increase in G and/or C content (absolute or relative) is conducted by replacing a codon ending with U with a synonymous codon ending with G or C.

In further embodiments, the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide of the invention comprises modified uracil and has an adjusted uracil content containing less uracil pairs (UU) and/or uracil triplets (UUU) and/or uracil quadruplets (UUUU) than the corresponding wild-type nucleotide sequence encoding the G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide of the invention contains no uracil pairs and/or uracil triplets and/or uracil quadruplets. In some embodiments, uracil pairs and/or uracil triplets and/or uracil quadruplets are reduced below a certain threshold, e.g., no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 occurrences in the ORF of the mRNA encoding the G6PC polypeptide. In a particular embodiment, the ORF of the mRNA encoding the G6PC polypeptide of the invention contains less than 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 non-phenylalanine uracil pairs and/or triplets. In another embodiment, the ORF of the mRNA encoding the G6PC polypeptide contains no non-phenylalanine uracil pairs and/or triplets.

In further embodiments, the ORF of the mRNA encoding a G6PC polypeptide of the invention comprises modified uracil and has an adjusted uracil content containing less uracil-rich clusters than the corresponding wild-type nucleotide sequence encoding the G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the ORF of the mRNA encoding the G6PC polypeptide of the invention contains uracil-rich clusters that are shorter in length than corresponding uracil-rich clusters in the corresponding wild-type nucleotide sequence encoding the G6PC polypeptide.

In further embodiments, alternative lower frequency codons are employed. At least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 99%, or 100% of the codons in the G6PC polypeptide-encoding ORF of the modified uracil-comprising mRNA are substituted with alternative codons, each alternative codon having a codon frequency lower than the codon frequency of the substituted codon in the synonymous codon set. The ORF also has adjusted uracil content, as described above. In some embodiments, at least one codon in the ORF of the mRNA encoding the G6PC polypeptide is substituted with an alternative codon having a codon frequency lower than the codon frequency of the substituted codon in the synonymous codon set.

In some embodiments, the adjusted uracil content, G6PC polypeptide-encoding ORF of the modified uracil-comprising mRNA exhibits expression levels of G6PC when administered to a mammalian cell that are higher than expression levels of G6PC from the corresponding wild-type mRNA. In some embodiments, the mammalian cell is a mouse cell, a rat cell, or a rabbit cell. In other embodiments, the mammalian cell is a monkey cell or a human cell. In some embodiments, the human cell is a HeLa cell, a BJ fibroblast cell, or a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). In some embodiments, G6PC is expressed a level higher than expression levels of G6PC from the corresponding wild-type mRNA when the mRNA is administered to a mammalian cell in vivo. In some embodiments, the mRNA is administered to mice, rabbits, rats, monkeys, or humans. In one embodiment, mice are null mice. In some embodiments, the mRNA is administered to mice in an amount of about 0.01 mg/kg, about 0.05 mg/kg, about 0.1 mg/kg, or 0.2 mg/kg or about 0.5 mg/kg. In some embodiments, the mRNA is administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In other embodiments, the G6PC polypeptide is expressed when the mRNA is administered to a mammalian cell in vitro. In some embodiments, the expression is increased by at least about 2-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 10-fold, at least about 50-fold, at least about 500-fold, at least about 1500-fold, or at least about 3000-fold. In other embodiments, the expression is increased by at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 100%.

In some embodiments, adjusted uracil content, G6PC polypeptide-encoding ORF of the modified uracil-comprising mRNA exhibits increased stability. In some embodiments, the mRNA exhibits increased stability in a cell relative to the stability of a corresponding wild-type mRNA under the same conditions. In some embodiments, the mRNA exhibits increased stability including resistance to nucleases, thermal stability, and/or increased stabilization of secondary structure. In some embodiments, increased stability exhibited by the mRNA is measured by determining the half-life of the mRNA (e.g., in a plasma, serum, cell, or tissue sample) and/or determining the area under the curve (AUC) of the protein expression by the mRNA over time (e.g., in vitro or in vivo). An mRNA is identified as having increased stability if the half-life and/or the AUC is greater than the half-life and/or the AUC of a corresponding wild-type mRNA under the same conditions.

In some embodiments, the mRNA of the present invention induces a detectably lower immune response (e.g., innate or acquired) relative to the immune response induced by a corresponding wild-type mRNA under the same conditions. In other embodiments, the mRNA of the present disclosure induces a detectably lower immune response (e.g., innate or acquired) relative to the immune response induced by an mRNA that encodes for a G6PC polypeptide but does not comprise modified uracil under the same conditions, or relative to the immune response induced by an mRNA that encodes for a G6PC polypeptide and that comprises modified uracil but that does not have adjusted uracil content under the same conditions. The innate immune response can be manifested by increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of intracellular PRRs (RIG-I, MDAS, etc.), cell death, and/or termination or reduction in protein translation. In some embodiments, a reduction in the innate immune response can be measured by expression or activity level of Type 1 interferons (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-κ, IFN-δ, IFN-ε, IFN-τ, IFN-ω,and IFN-ζ) or the expression of interferon-regulated genes such as the toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR7 and TLR8), and/or by decreased cell death following one or more administrations of the mRNA of the invention into a cell.

In some embodiments, the expression of Type-1 interferons by a mammalian cell in response to the mRNA of the present disclosure is reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, or greater than 99.9% relative to a corresponding wild-type mRNA, to an mRNA that encodes a G6PC polypeptide but does not comprise modified uracil, or to an mRNA that encodes a G6PC polypeptide and that comprises modified uracil but that does not have adjusted uracil content. In some embodiments, the interferon is IFN-0. In some embodiments, cell death frequency caused by administration of mRNA of the present disclosure to a mammalian cell is 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or over 95% less than the cell death frequency observed with a corresponding wild-type mRNA, an mRNA that encodes for a G6PC polypeptide but does not comprise modified uracil, or an mRNA that encodes for a G6PC polypeptide and that comprises modified uracil but that does not have adjusted uracil content. In some embodiments, the mammalian cell is a BJ fibroblast cell. In other embodiments, the mammalian cell is a splenocyte. In some embodiments, the mammalian cell is that of a mouse or a rat. In other embodiments, the mammalian cell is that of a human. In one embodiment, the mRNA of the present disclosure does not substantially induce an innate immune response of a mammalian cell into which the mRNA is introduced.

**9. Methods for Modifying Polynucleotides**

The disclosure includes modified polynucleotides comprising a polynucleotide described herein (e.g., a polynucleotide, e.g. mRNA, comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide). The modified polynucleotides can be chemically modified and/or structurally modified. When the polynucleotides of the present invention are chemically and/or structurally modified the polynucleotides can be referred to as “modified polynucleotides.”

The present disclosure provides for modified nucleosides and nucleotides of a polynucleotide (e.g., RNA polynucleotides, such as mRNA polynucleotides) encoding a G6PC polypeptide. A “nucleoside” refers to a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a pentose or ribose) or a derivative thereof in combination with an organic base (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine) or a derivative thereof (also referred to herein as “nucleobase”). A “nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside including a phosphate group. Modified nucleotides can be synthesized by any useful method, such as, for example, chemically, enzymatically, or recombinantly, to include one or more modified or non-natural nucleosides. Polynucleotides can comprise a region or regions of linked nucleosides. Such regions can have variable backbone linkages. The linkages can be standard phosphodiester linkages, in which case the polynucleotides would comprise regions of nucleotides.

The modified polynucleotides disclosed herein can comprise various distinct modifications. In some embodiments, the modified polynucleotides contain one, two, or more (optionally different) nucleoside or nucleotide modifications. In some embodiments, a modified polynucleotide, introduced to a cell can exhibit one or more desirable properties, e.g., improved protein expression, reduced immunogenicity, or reduced degradation in the cell, as compared to an unmodified polynucleotide.

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) is structurally modified. As used herein, a “structural” modification is one in which two or more linked nucleosides are inserted, deleted, duplicated, inverted or randomized in a polynucleotide without significant chemical modification to the nucleotides themselves. Because chemical bonds will necessarily be broken and reformed to affect a structural modification, structural modifications are of a chemical nature and hence are chemical modifications. However, structural modifications will result in a different sequence of nucleotides. For example, the polynucleotide “ATCG” can be chemically modified to “AT-5meC-G”. The same polynucleotide can be structurally modified from “ATCG” to “ATCCCG”. Here, the dinucleotide “CC” has been inserted, resulting in a structural modification to the polynucleotide.

Therapeutic compositions of the present disclosure comprise, in some embodiments, at least one nucleic acid (e.g., RNA) having an open reading frame encoding G6PC (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:8, 11-20, 22-38, or 207), wherein the nucleic acid comprises nucleotides and/or nucleosides that can be standard (unmodified) or modified as is known in the art. In some embodiments, nucleotides and nucleosides of the present disclosure comprise modified nucleotides or nucleosides. Such modified nucleotides and nucleosides can be naturally-occurring modified nucleotides and nucleosides or non-naturally occurring modified nucleotides and nucleosides. Such modifications can include those at the sugar, backbone, or nucleobase portion of the nucleotide and/or nucleoside as are recognized in the art.

In some embodiments, a naturally-occurring modified nucleotide or nucleotide of the disclosure is one as is generally known or recognized in the art. Non-limiting examples of such naturally occurring modified nucleotides and nucleotides can be found, inter alia, in the widely recognized MODOMICS database.

Nucleic acids (e.g., RNA nucleic acids, such as mRNA nucleic acids), in some embodiments, comprise non-natural modified nucleotides that are introduced during synthesis or post-synthesis of the nucleic acids to achieve desired functions or properties. The modifications may be present on internucleotide linkages, purine or pyrimidine bases, or sugars. The modification may be introduced with chemical synthesis or with a polymerase enzyme at the terminal of a chain or anywhere else in the chain. Any of the regions of a nucleic acid may be chemically modified.

The present disclosure provides for modified nucleosides and nucleotides of a nucleic acid (e.g., RNA nucleic acids, such as mRNA nucleic acids). A “nucleoside” refers to a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a pentose or ribose) or a derivative thereof in combination with an organic base (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine) or a derivative thereof (also referred to herein as “nucleobase”). A “nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside, including a phosphate group. Modified nucleotides may by synthesized by any useful method, such as, for example, chemically, enzymatically, or recombinantly, to include one or more modified or non-natural nucleosides. Nucleic acids can comprise a region or regions of linked nucleosides. Such regions may have variable backbone linkages. The linkages can be standard phosphodiester linkages, in which case the nucleic acids would comprise regions of nucleotides.

Modified nucleotide base pairing encompasses not only the standard adenosine-thymine, adenosine-uracil, or guanosine-cytosine base pairs, but also base pairs formed between nucleotides and/or modified nucleotides comprising non-standard or modified bases, wherein the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors permits hydrogen bonding between a non-standard base and a standard base or between two complementary non-standard base structures, such as, for example, in those nucleic acids having at least one chemical modification. One example of such non-standard base pairing is the base pairing between the modified nucleotide inosine and adenine, cytosine or uracil. Any combination of base/sugar or linker may be incorporated into nucleic acids of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, modified nucleobases in nucleic acids (e.g., RNA nucleic acids, such as mRNA nucleic acids) comprise N1-methyl-pseudouridine (m1ψ), 1-ethyl-pseudouridine (e1ψ), 5-methoxy-uridine (mo5U), 5-methyl-cytidine (m5C), and/or pseudouridine (w). In some embodiments, modified nucleobases in nucleic acids (e.g., RNA nucleic acids, such as mRNA nucleic acids) comprise 5-methoxymethyl uridine, 5-methylthio uridine, 1-methoxymethyl pseudouridine, 5-methyl cytidine, and/or 5-methoxy cytidine.

In some embodiments, nucleic acids (e.g., RNA nucleic acids, such as mRNA nucleic acids) are uniformly modified (e.g., fully modified, modified throughout the entire sequence) for a particular modification. For example, a nucleic acid can be uniformly modified with N1-methyl-pseudouridine, meaning that all uridine residues in the mRNA sequence are replaced with N1-methyl-pseudouridine. Similarly, a nucleic acid can be uniformly modified for any type of nucleoside residue present in the sequence by replacement with a modified residue such as those set forth above.

The nucleic acids of the present disclosure may be partially or fully modified along the entire length of the molecule. For example, one or more or all or a given type of nucleotide (e.g., purine or pyrimidine, or any one or more or all of A, G, U, C) may be uniformly modified in a nucleic acid of the disclosure, or in a predetermined sequence region thereof (e.g., in the mRNA including or excluding the polyA tail). In some embodiments, all nucleotides X in a nucleic acid of the present disclosure (or in a sequence region thereof) are modified nucleotides, wherein X may be any one of nucleotides A, G, U, C, or any one of the combinations A+G, A+U, A+C, G+U, G+C, U+C, A+G+U, A+G+C, G+U+C or A+G+C.

The nucleic acid may contain from about 1% to about 100% modified nucleotides (either in relation to overall nucleotide content, or in relation to one or more types of nucleotide, i.e., any one or more of A, G, U or C) or any intervening percentage (e.g., from 1% to 20%, from 1% to 25%, from 1% to 50%, from 1% to 60%, from 1% to 70%, from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 90%, from 1% to 95%, from 10% to 20%, from 10% to 25%, from 10% to 50%, from 10% to 60%, from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 80%, from 10% to 90%, from 10% to 95%, from 10% to 100%, from 20% to 25%, from 20% to 50%, from 20% to 60%, from 20% to 70%, from 20% to 80%, from 20% to 90%, from 20% to 95%, from 20% to 100%, from 50% to 60%, from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 80%, from 50% to 90%, from 50% to 95%, from 50% to 100%, from 70% to 80%, from 70% to 90%, from 70% to 95%, from 70% to 100%, from 80% to 90%, from 80% to 95%, from 80% to 100%, from 90% to 95%, from 90% to 100%, and from 95% to 100%).

The modified uracil can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures). In some embodiments, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or 100% of the cytosine in the nucleic acid is replaced with a modified cytosine (e.g., a 5-substituted cytosine). The modified cytosine can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures).

**10. Untranslated Regions (UTRs)**

Translation of a polynucleotide comprising an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide can be controlled and regulated by a variety of mechanisms that are provided by various cis-acting nucleic acid structures. For example, naturally-occurring, cis-acting RNA elements that form hairpins or other higher-order (e.g., pseudoknot) intramolecular mRNA secondary structures can provide a translational regulatory activity to a polynucleotide, wherein the RNA element influences or modulates the initiation of polynucleotide translation, particularly when the RNA element is positioned in the 5′ UTR close to the 5′-cap structure (Pelletier and Sonenberg (1985) Cell 40(3):515-526; Kozak (1986) Proc Natl Acad Sci 83:2850-2854).

Untranslated regions (UTRs) are nucleic acid sections of a polynucleotide before a start codon (5′ UTR) and after a stop codon (3′ UTR) that are not translated. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide (e.g., a ribonucleic acid (RNA), e.g., a messenger RNA (mRNA)) of the invention comprising an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a G6PC polypeptide further comprises UTR (e.g., a 5′ UTR or functional fragment thereof, a 3′ UTR or functional fragment thereof, or a combination thereof).

Cis-acting RNA elements can also affect translation elongation, being involved in numerous frameshifting events (Namy et al., (2004) Mol Cell 13(2):157-168). Internal ribosome entry sequences (IRES) represent another type of cis-acting RNA element that are typically located in 5′ UTRs, but have also been reported to be found within the coding region of naturally-occurring mRNAs (Holcik et al. (2000) Trends Genet 16(10):469-473). In cellular mRNAs, IRES often coexist with the 5′-cap structure and provide mRNAs with the functional capacity to be translated under conditions in which cap-dependent translation is compromised (Gebauer et al., (2012) Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 4(7):a012245). Another type of naturally-occurring cis-acting RNA element comprises upstream open reading frames (uORFs).

Naturally-occurring uORFs occur singularly or multiply within the 5′ UTRs of numerous mRNAs and influence the translation of the downstream major ORF, usually negatively (with the notable exception of GCN4 mRNA in yeast and ATF4 mRNA in mammals, where uORFs serve to promote the translation of the downstream major ORF under conditions of increased eIF2 phosphorylation (Hinnebusch (2005) Annu Rev Microbiol 59:407-450)). Additional exemplary translational regulatory activities provided by components, structures, elements, motifs, and/or specific sequences comprising polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) include, but are not limited to, mRNA stabilization or destabilization (Baker & Parker (2004) Curr Opin Cell Biol 16(3):293-299), translational activation (Villalba et al., (2011) Curr Opin Genet Dev 21(4):452-457), and translational repression (Blumer et al., (2002) Mech Dev 110(1-2):97-112). Studies have shown that naturally-occurring, cis-acting RNA elements can confer their respective functions when used to modify, by incorporation into, heterologous polynucleotides (Goldberg-Cohen et al., (2002) J Biol Chem 277(16):13635-13640).

In another embodiment, the stable RNA secondary structure has a deltaG of about −30 kcal/mol, about −20 to −30 kcal/mol, about −20 kcal/mol, about −10 to −20 kcal/mol, about −10 kcal/mol, about −5 to ˜10 kcal/mol.

In another embodiment, the modification is operably linked to an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide and wherein the modification and the open reading frame are heterologous.

In another embodiment, the sequence of the GC-rich RNA element is comprised exclusively of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleobases.

RNA elements that provide a desired translational regulatory activity as described herein can be identified and characterized using known techniques, such as ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling is a technique that allows the determination of the positions of PICs and/or ribosomes bound to mRNAs (see e.g., Ingolia et al., (2009) Science 324(5924):218-23, incorporated herein by reference). The technique is based on protecting a region or segment of mRNA, by the PIC and/or ribosome, from nuclease digestion. Protection results in the generation of a 30-bp fragment of RNA termed a ‘footprint’. The sequence and frequency of RNA footprints can be analyzed by methods known in the art (e.g., RNA-seq). The footprint is roughly centered on the A-site of the ribosome. If the PIC or ribosome dwells at a particular position or location along an mRNA, footprints generated at these positions would be relatively common. Studies have shown that more footprints are generated at positions where the PIC and/or ribosome exhibits decreased processivity and fewer footprints where the PIC and/or ribosome exhibits increased processivity (Gardin et al., (2014) eLife 3:e03735). In some embodiments, residence time or the time of occupancy of the PIC or ribosome at a discrete position or location along a polynucleotide comprising any one or more of the RNA elements described herein is determined by ribosome profiling.

A UTR can be homologous or heterologous to the coding region in a polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the UTR is homologous to the ORF encoding the G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the UTR is heterologous to the ORF encoding the G6PC polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises two or more 5′ UTRs or functional fragments thereof, each of which has the same or different nucleotide sequences. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises two or more 3′ UTRs or functional fragments thereof, each of which has the same or different nucleotide sequences.

In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR or functional fragment thereof, 3′ UTR or functional fragment thereof, or any combination thereof is sequence optimized.

In some embodiments, the 5′UTR or functional fragment thereof, 3′ UTR or functional fragment thereof, or any combination thereof comprises at least one chemically modified nucleobase, e.g., N1-methylpseudouracil or 5-methoxyuracil.

UTRs can have features that provide a regulatory role, e.g., increased or decreased stability, localization and/or translation efficiency. A polynucleotide comprising a UTR can be administered to a cell, tissue, or organism, and one or more regulatory features can be measured using routine methods. In some embodiments, a functional fragment of a 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR comprises one or more regulatory features of a full length 5′ or 3′ UTR, respectively.

Natural 5′UTRs bear features that play roles in translation initiation. They harbor signatures like Kozak sequences that are commonly known to be involved in the process by which the ribosome initiates translation of many genes. Kozak sequences have the consensus CCR(A/G)CCAUGG (SEQ ID NO:87), where R is a purine (adenine or guanine) three bases upstream of the start codon (AUG), which is followed by another ‘G’. 5′ UTRs also have been known to form secondary structures that are involved in elongation factor binding.

By engineering the features typically found in abundantly expressed genes of specific target organs, one can enhance the stability and protein production of a polynucleotide. For example, introduction of 5′ UTR of liver-expressed mRNA, such as albumin, serum amyloid A, Apolipoprotein A/B/E, transferrin, alpha fetoprotein, erythropoietin, or Factor VIII, can enhance expression of polynucleotides in hepatic cell lines or liver. Likewise, use of 5′UTR from other tissue-specific mRNA to improve expression in that tissue is possible for muscle (e.g., MyoD, Myosin, Myoglobin, Myogenin, Herculin), for endothelial cells (e.g., Tie-1, CD36), for myeloid cells (e.g., C/EBP, AML1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CD11b, MSR, Fr-1, i-NOS), for leukocytes (e.g., CD45, CD18), for adipose tissue (e.g., CD36, GLUT4, ACRP30, adiponectin) and for lung epithelial cells (e.g., SP-A/B/C/D).

In some embodiments, UTRs are selected from a family of transcripts whose proteins share a common function, structure, feature or property. For example, an encoded polypeptide can belong to a family of proteins (i.e., that share at least one function, structure, feature, localization, origin, or expression pattern), which are expressed in a particular cell, tissue or at some time during development. The UTRs from any of the genes or mRNA can be swapped for any other UTR of the same or different family of proteins to create a new polynucleotide.

In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR and the 3′ UTR can be heterologous. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR can be derived from a different species than the 3′ UTR. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR can be derived from a different species than the 5′ UTR.

Wild-type UTRs derived from any gene or mRNA can be incorporated into the polynucleotides of the invention. In some embodiments, a UTR can be altered relative to a wild type or native UTR to produce a variant UTR, e.g., by changing the orientation or location of the UTR relative to the ORF; or by inclusion of additional nucleotides, deletion of nucleotides, swapping or transposition of nucleotides. In some embodiments, variants of 5′ or 3′ UTRs can be utilized, for example, mutants of wild type UTRs, or variants wherein one or more nucleotides are added to or removed from a terminus of the UTR.

Additionally, one or more synthetic UTRs can be used in combination with one or more non-synthetic UTRs. See, e.g., Mandal and Rossi, Nat. Protoc. 2013 8(3):568-82, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

UTRs or portions thereof can be placed in the same orientation as in the transcript from which they were selected or can be altered in orientation or location. Hence, a 5′ and/or 3′ UTR can be inverted, shortened, lengthened, or combined with one or more other 5′ UTRs or 3′ UTRs.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises multiple UTRs, e.g., a double, a triple or a quadruple 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR. For example, a double UTR comprises two copies of the same UTR either in series or substantially in series. For example, a double beta-globin 3′UTR can be used (see US2010/0129877, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention comprise a 5′ UTR and/or a 3′ UTR selected from any of the UTRs disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR comprises:

In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises:

In certain embodiments, the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR sequence of the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or about 100% identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of 5′ UTR sequences comprising any of SEQ ID NOs: 3, 88-102, or 165-167 and/or 3′ UTR sequences comprises any of SEQ ID NOs:4, 104-112, 150, or 175, and any combination thereof.

In certain embodiments, the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR sequence of the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or about 100% identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of 5′ UTR sequences comprising any of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:210, or SEQ ID NO:211 and/or 3′ UTR sequences comprises any of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:111, SEQ ID NO:150, SEQ ID NO:175, SEQ ID NO:177, SEQ ID NO:178, SEQ ID NO:212, or SEQ ID NO:213, and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in Table 4B (SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:210, or SEQ ID NO:211). In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in Table 4B (SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:111, SEQ ID NO:150, SEQ ID NO:175, SEQ ID NO:177, SEQ ID NO:178, SEQ ID NO:212, or SEQ ID NO:213).

The polynucleotides of the invention can comprise combinations of features. For example, the ORF can be flanked by a 5′UTR that comprises a strong Kozak translational initiation signal and/or a 3′UTR comprising an oligo(dT) sequence for templated addition of a poly-A tail. A 5′UTR can comprise a first polynucleotide fragment and a second polynucleotide fragment from the same and/or different UTRs (see, e.g., US2010/0293625, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

Other non-UTR sequences can be used as regions or subregions within the polynucleotides of the invention. For example, introns or portions of intron sequences can be incorporated into the polynucleotides of the invention. Incorporation of intronic sequences can increase protein production as well as polynucleotide expression levels. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention comprises an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) instead of or in addition to a UTR (see, e.g., Yakubov et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010 394(1):189-193, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises an IRES instead of a 5′ UTR sequence. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises an ORF and a viral capsid sequence. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a synthetic 5′ UTR in combination with a non-synthetic 3′ UTR.

In some embodiments, the UTR can also include at least one translation enhancer polynucleotide, translation enhancer element, or translational enhancer elements (collectively, “TEE,” which refers to nucleic acid sequences that increase the amount of polypeptide or protein produced from a polynucleotide. As a non-limiting example, the TEE can be located between the transcription promoter and the start codon. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR comprises a TEE.

In one aspect, a TEE is a conserved element in a UTR that can promote translational activity of a nucleic acid such as, but not limited to, cap-dependent or cap-independent translation.

**11. MicroRNA (miRNA) Binding Sites**

Polynucleotides of the invention can include regulatory elements, for example, microRNA (miRNA) binding sites, transcription factor binding sites, structured mRNA sequences and/or motifs, artificial binding sites engineered to act as pseudo-receptors for endogenous nucleic acid binding molecules, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, polynucleotides including such regulatory elements are referred to as including “sensor sequences”.

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide (e.g., a ribonucleic acid (RNA), e.g., a messenger RNA (mRNA)) of the invention comprises an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of interest and further comprises one or more miRNA binding site(s). Inclusion or incorporation of miRNA binding site(s) provides for regulation of polynucleotides of the invention, and in turn, of the polypeptides encoded therefrom, based on tissue-specific and/or cell-type specific expression of naturally-occurring miRNAs.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions and formulations that comprise any of the polynucleotides described above. In some embodiments, the composition or formulation further comprises a delivery agent.

In some embodiments, the composition or formulation can contain a polynucleotide comprising a sequence optimized nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein which encodes a polypeptide. In some embodiments, the composition or formulation can contain a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) comprising a polynucleotide (e.g., an ORF) having significant sequence identity to a sequence optimized nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein which encodes a polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide further comprises a miRNA binding site, e.g., a miRNA binding site that binds

A miRNA, e.g., a natural-occurring miRNA, is a 19-25 nucleotide long noncoding RNA that binds to a polynucleotide and down-regulates gene expression either by reducing stability or by inhibiting translation of the polynucleotide. A miRNA sequence comprises a “seed” region, i.e., a sequence in the region of positions 2-8 of the mature miRNA. A miRNA seed can comprise positions 2-8 or 2-7 of the mature miRNA.

microRNAs derive enzymatically from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short hairpin structures often termed a pre-miRNA (precursor-miRNA). A pre-miRNA typically has a two-nucleotide overhang at its 3′ end, and has 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ phosphate groups. This precursor-mRNA is processed in the nucleus and subsequently transported to the cytoplasm where it is further processed by DICER (a RNase III enzyme), to form a mature microRNA of approximately 22 nucleotides. The mature microRNA is then incorporated into a ribonuclear particle to form the RNA-induced silencing complex, RISC, which mediates gene silencing. Art-recognized nomenclature for mature miRNAs typically designates the arm of the pre-miRNA from which the mature miRNA derives; “5p” means the microRNA is from the 5-prime arm of the pre-miRNA hairpin and “3p” means the microRNA is from the 3-prime end of the pre-miRNA hairpin. A miR referred to by number herein can refer to either of the two mature microRNAs originating from opposite arms of the same pre-miRNA (e.g., either the 3p or 5p microRNA). All miRs referred to herein are intended to include both the 3p and 5p arms/sequences, unless particularly specified by the 3p or 5p designation.

As used herein, the term “microRNA (miRNA or miR) binding site” refers to a sequence within a polynucleotide, e.g., within a DNA or within an RNA transcript, including in the 5′UTR and/or 3′UTR, that has sufficient complementarity to all or a region of a miRNA to interact with, associate with or bind to the miRNA. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the invention comprising an ORF encoding a polypeptide of interest and further comprises one or more miRNA binding site(s). In exemplary embodiments, a 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR of the polynucleotide (e.g., a ribonucleic acid (RNA), e.g., a messenger RNA (mRNA)) comprises the one or more miRNA binding site(s).

A miRNA binding site having sufficient complementarity to a miRNA refers to a degree of complementarity sufficient to facilitate miRNA-mediated regulation of a polynucleotide, e.g., miRNA-mediated translational repression or degradation of the polynucleotide. In exemplary aspects of the invention, a miRNA binding site having sufficient complementarity to the miRNA refers to a degree of complementarity sufficient to facilitate miRNA-mediated degradation of the polynucleotide, e.g., miRNA-guided RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of mRNA. The miRNA binding site can have complementarity to, for example, a 19-25 nucleotide long miRNA sequence, to a 19-23 nucleotide long miRNA sequence, or to a 22-nucleotide long miRNA sequence. A miRNA binding site can be complementary to only a portion of a miRNA, e.g., to a portion less than 1, 2, 3, or 4 nucleotides of the full length of a naturally-occurring miRNA sequence, or to a portion less than 1, 2, 3, or 4 nucleotides shorter than a naturally-occurring miRNA sequence. Full or complete complementarity (e.g., full complementarity or complete complementarity over all or a significant portion of the length of a naturally-occurring miRNA) is preferred when the desired regulation is mRNA degradation.

In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site includes a sequence that has complementarity (e.g., partial or complete complementarity) with a miRNA seed sequence. In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site includes a sequence that has complete complementarity with a miRNA seed sequence. In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site includes a sequence that has complementarity (e.g., partial or complete complementarity) with a miRNA sequence. In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site includes a sequence that has complete complementarity with a miRNA sequence. In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site has complete complementarity with a miRNA sequence but for 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide substitutions, terminal additions, and/or truncations.

In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site is the same length as the corresponding miRNA. In other embodiments, the miRNA binding site is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve nucleotide(s) shorter than the corresponding miRNA at the 5′ terminus, the 3′ terminus, or both. In still other embodiments, the microRNA binding site is two nucleotides shorter than the corresponding microRNA at the 5′ terminus, the 3′ terminus, or both. The miRNA binding sites that are shorter than the corresponding miRNAs are still capable of degrading the mRNA incorporating one or more of the miRNA binding sites or preventing the mRNA from translation.

In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site binds the corresponding mature miRNA that is part of an active RISC containing Dicer. In another embodiment, binding of the miRNA binding site to the corresponding miRNA in RISC degrades the mRNA containing the miRNA binding site or prevents the mRNA from being translated. In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site has sufficient complementarity to miRNA so that a RISC complex comprising the miRNA cleaves the polynucleotide comprising the miRNA binding site. In other embodiments, the miRNA binding site has imperfect complementarity so that a RISC complex comprising the miRNA induces instability in the polynucleotide comprising the miRNA binding site. In another embodiment, the miRNA binding site has imperfect complementarity so that a RISC complex comprising the miRNA represses transcription of the polynucleotide comprising the miRNA binding site.

In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve mismatch(es) from the corresponding miRNA.

In some embodiments, the miRNA binding site has at least about ten, at least about eleven, at least about twelve, at least about thirteen, at least about fourteen, at least about fifteen, at least about sixteen, at least about seventeen, at least about eighteen, at least about nineteen, at least about twenty, or at least about twenty-one contiguous nucleotides complementary to at least about ten, at least about eleven, at least about twelve, at least about thirteen, at least about fourteen, at least about fifteen, at least about sixteen, at least about seventeen, at least about eighteen, at least about nineteen, at least about twenty, or at least about twenty-one, respectively, contiguous nucleotides of the corresponding miRNA.

By engineering one or more miRNA binding sites into a polynucleotide of the invention, the polynucleotide can be targeted for degradation or reduced translation, provided the miRNA in question is available. This can reduce off-target effects upon delivery of the polynucleotide. For example, if a polynucleotide of the invention is not intended to be delivered to a tissue or cell but ends up is said tissue or cell, then a miRNA abundant in the tissue or cell can inhibit the expression of the gene of interest if one or multiple binding sites of the miRNA are engineered into the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR of the polynucleotide. Thus, in some embodiments, incorporation of one or more miRNA binding sites into an mRNA of the disclosure may reduce the hazard of off-target effects upon nucleic acid molecule delivery and/or enable tissue-specific regulation of expression of a polypeptide encoded by the mRNA. In yet other embodiments, incorporation of one or more miRNA binding sites into an mRNA of the disclosure can modulate immune responses upon nucleic acid delivery in vivo. In further embodiments, incorporation of one or more miRNA binding sites into an mRNA of the disclosure can modulate accelerated blood clearance (ABC) of lipid-comprising compounds and compositions described herein.

Conversely, miRNA binding sites can be removed from polynucleotide sequences in which they naturally occur to increase protein expression in specific tissues. For example, a binding site for a specific miRNA can be removed from a polynucleotide to improve protein expression in tissues or cells containing the miRNA.

Regulation of expression in multiple tissues can be accomplished through introduction or removal of one or more miRNA binding sites, e.g., one or more distinct miRNA binding sites. The decision whether to remove or insert a miRNA binding site can be made based on miRNA expression patterns and/or their profiling in tissues and/or cells in development and/or disease. Identification of miRNAs, miRNA binding sites, and their expression patterns and role in biology have been reported (e.g., Bonauer et al., Curr Drug Targets 2010 11:943-949; Anand and Cheresh Curr Opin Hematol 2011 18:171-176; Contreras and Rao Leukemia 2012 26:404-413 (2011 Dec. 20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.356); Bartel Cell 2009 136:215-233; Landgraf et al, Cell, 2007 129:1401-1414; Gentner and Naldini, Tissue Antigens. 2012 80:393-403 and all references therein; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

Examples of tissues where miRNA are known to regulate mRNA, and thereby protein expression, include, but are not limited to, liver (miR-122), muscle (miR-133, miR-206, miR-208), endothelial cells (miR-17-92, miR-126), myeloid cells (miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-16, miR-21, miR-223, miR-24, miR-27), adipose tissue (let-7, miR-30c), heart (miR-id, miR-149), kidney (miR-192, miR-194, miR-204), and lung epithelial cells (let-7, miR-133, miR-126).

Specifically, miRNAs are known to be differentially expressed in immune cells (also called hematopoietic cells), such as antigen presenting cells (APCs) (e.g., dendritic cells and macrophages), macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, etc. Immune cell specific miRNAs are involved in immunogenicity, autoimmunity, the immune-response to infection, inflammation, as well as unwanted immune response after gene therapy and tissue/organ transplantation. Immune cells specific miRNAs also regulate many aspects of development, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells (immune cells). For example, miR-142 and miR-146 are exclusively expressed in immune cells, particularly abundant in myeloid dendritic cells. It has been demonstrated that the immune response to a polynucleotide can be shut-off by adding miR-142 binding sites to the 3′-UTR of the polynucleotide, enabling more stable gene transfer in tissues and cells. miR-142 efficiently degrades exogenous polynucleotides in antigen presenting cells and suppresses cytotoxic elimination of transduced cells (e.g., Annoni A et al., blood, 2009, 114, 5152-5161; Brown B D, et al., Nat med. 2006, 12(5), 585-591; Brown B D, et al., blood, 2007, 110(13): 4144-4152, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

An antigen-mediated immune response can refer to an immune response triggered by foreign antigens, which, when entering an organism, are processed by the antigen presenting cells and displayed on the surface of the antigen presenting cells. T cells can recognize the presented antigen and induce a cytotoxic elimination of cells that express the antigen.

Introducing a miR-142 binding site into the 5′ UTR and/or 3′UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention can selectively repress gene expression in antigen presenting cells through miR-142 mediated degradation, limiting antigen presentation in antigen presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) and thereby preventing antigen-mediated immune response after the delivery of the polynucleotide. The polynucleotide is then stably expressed in target tissues or cells without triggering cytotoxic elimination.

In one embodiment, binding sites for miRNAs that are known to be expressed in immune cells, in particular, antigen presenting cells, can be engineered into a polynucleotide of the invention to suppress the expression of the polynucleotide in antigen presenting cells through miRNA mediated RNA degradation, subduing the antigen-mediated immune response. Expression of the polynucleotide is maintained in non-immune cells where the immune cell specific miRNAs are not expressed. For example, in some embodiments, to prevent an immunogenic reaction against a liver specific protein, any miR-122 binding site can be removed and a miR-142 (and/or mirR-146) binding site can be engineered into the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention.

To further drive the selective degradation and suppression in APCs and macrophage, a polynucleotide of the invention can include a further negative regulatory element in the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR, either alone or in combination with miR-142 and/or miR-146 binding sites. As a non-limiting example, the further negative regulatory element is a Constitutive Decay Element (CDE).

In addition, a large group of miRNAs are enriched in embryonic stem cells, controlling stem cell self-renewal as well as the development and/or differentiation of various cell lineages, such as neural cells, cardiac, hematopoietic cells, skin cells, osteogenic cells and muscle cells (e.g., Kuppusamy K T et al., Curr. Mol Med, 2013, 13(5), 757-764; Vidigal J A and Ventura A, Semin Cancer Biol. 2012, 22(5-6), 428-436; Goff L A et al., PLoS One, 2009, 4:e7192; Morin R D et al., Genome Res, 2008,18, 610-621; Yoo J K et al., Stem Cells Dev. 2012, 21(11), 2049-2057, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). miRNAs abundant in embryonic stem cells include, but are not limited to, let-7a-2-3p, let-a-3p, let-7a-5p, let7d-3p, let-7d-5p, miR-103a-2-3p, miR-103a-5p, miR-106b-3p, miR-106b-5p, miR-1246, miR-1275, miR-138-1-3p, miR-138-2-3p, miR-138-5p, miR-154-3p, miR-154-5p, miR-200c-3p, miR-200c-5p, miR-290, miR-301a-3p, miR-301a-5p, miR-302a-3p, miR-302a-5p, miR-302b-3p, miR-302b-5p, miR-302c-3p, miR-302c-5p, miR-302d-3p, miR-302d-5p, miR-302e, miR-367-3p, miR-367-5p, miR-369-3p, miR-369-5p, miR-370, miR-371, miR-373, miR-380-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-423-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-520c-3p, miR-548e, miR-548f, miR-548g-3p, miR-548g-5p, miR-548i, miR-548k, miR-5481, miR-548m, miR-548n, miR-5480-3p, miR-5480-5p, miR-548p, miR-664a-3p, miR-664a-5p, miR-664b-3p, miR-664b-5p, miR-766-3p, miR-766-5p, miR-885-3p, miR-885-5p, miR-93-3p, miR-93-5p, miR-941, miR-96-3p, miR-96-5p, miR-99b-3p and miR-99b-5p. Many predicted novel miRNAs are discovered by deep sequencing in human embryonic stem cells (e.g., Morin R D et al., Genome Res, 2008,18, 610-621; Goff L A et al., PLoS One, 2009, 4:e7192; Bar M et al., Stem cells, 2008, 26, 2496-2505, the content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

In some embodiments, miRNAs are selected based on expression and abundance in immune cells of the hematopoietic lineage, such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cells that are known to express TLR7/TLR8 and/or able to secrete cytokines such as endothelial cells and platelets. In some embodiments, the miRNA set thus includes miRs that may be responsible in part for the immunogenicity of these cells, and such that a corresponding miR-site incorporation in polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., mRNAs) could lead to destabilization of the mRNA and/or suppression of translation from these mRNAs in the specific cell type. Non-limiting representative examples include miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155 and miR-223, which are specific for many of the hematopoietic cells; miR-142, miR150, miR-16 and miR-223, which are expressed in B cells; miR-223, miR-451, miR-26a, miR-16, which are expressed in progenitor hematopoietic cells; and miR-126, which is expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, platelets and endothelial cells. For further discussion of tissue expression of miRs see e.g., Teruel-Montoya, R. et al. (2014) PLoS One 9:e102259; Landgraf, P. et al. (2007) Cell 129:1401-1414; Bissels, U. et al. (2009) RNA 15:2375-2384. Any one miR-site incorporation in the 3′ UTR and/or 5′ UTR may mediate such effects in multiple cell types of interest (e.g., miR-142 is abundant in both B cells and dendritic cells).

In some embodiments, it may be beneficial to target the same cell type with multiple miRs and to incorporate binding sites to each of the 3p and 5p arm if both are abundant (e.g., both miR-142-3p and miR142-5p are abundant in hematopoietic stem cells). Thus, in certain embodiments, polynucleotides of the invention contain two or more (e.g., two, three, four or more) miR bindings sites from: (i) the group consisting of miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155 and miR-223 (which are expressed in many hematopoietic cells); or (ii) the group consisting of miR-142, miR150, miR-16 and miR-223 (which are expressed in B cells); or the group consisting of miR-223, miR-451, miR-26a, miR-16 (which are expressed in progenitor hematopoietic cells).

In some embodiments, it may also be beneficial to combine various miRs such that multiple cell types of interest are targeted at the same time (e.g., miR-142 and miR-126 to target many cells of the hematopoietic lineage and endothelial cells). Thus, for example, in certain embodiments, polynucleotides of the invention comprise two or more (e.g., two, three, four or more) miRNA bindings sites, wherein: (i) at least one of the miRs targets cells of the hematopoietic lineage (e.g., miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155 or miR-223) and at least one of the miRs targets plasmacytoid dendritic cells, platelets or endothelial cells (e.g., miR-126); or (ii) at least one of the miRs targets B cells (e.g., miR-142, miR150, miR-16 or miR-223) and at least one of the miRs targets plasmacytoid dendritic cells, platelets or endothelial cells (e.g., miR-126); or (iii) at least one of the miRs targets progenitor hematopoietic cells (e.g., miR-223, miR-451, miR-26a or miR-16) and at least one of the miRs targets plasmacytoid dendritic cells, platelets or endothelial cells (e.g., miR-126); or (iv) at least one of the miRs targets cells of the hematopoietic lineage (e.g., miR-142, miR-144, miR-150, miR-155 or miR-223), at least one of the miRs targets B cells (e.g., miR-142, miR150, miR-16 or miR-223) and at least one of the miRs targets plasmacytoid dendritic cells, platelets or endothelial cells (e.g., miR-126); or any other possible combination of the foregoing four classes of miR binding sites (i.e., those targeting the hematopoietic lineage, those targeting B cells, those targeting progenitor hematopoietic cells and/or those targeting plasmacytoid dendritic cells/platelets/endothelial cells).

In one embodiment, to modulate immune responses, polynucleotides of the present invention can comprise one or more miRNA binding sequences that bind to one or more miRs that are expressed in conventional immune cells or any cell that expresses TLR7 and/or TLR8 and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines (e.g., in immune cells of peripheral lymphoid organs and/or splenocytes and/or endothelial cells). It has now been discovered that incorporation into an mRNA of one or more miRs that are expressed in conventional immune cells or any cell that expresses TLR7 and/or TLR8 and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines (e.g., in immune cells of peripheral lymphoid organs and/or splenocytes and/or endothelial cells) reduces or inhibits immune cell activation (e.g., B cell activation, as measured by frequency of activated B cells) and/or cytokine production (e.g., production of IL-6, IFN-γ and/or TNFα). Furthermore, it has now been discovered that incorporation into an mRNA of one or more miRs that are expressed in conventional immune cells or any cell that expresses TLR7 and/or TLR8 and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines (e.g., in immune cells of peripheral lymphoid organs and/or splenocytes and/or endothelial cells) can reduce or inhibit an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response against a protein of interest encoded by the mRNA.

In another embodiment, to modulate accelerated blood clearance of a polynucleotide delivered in a lipid-comprising compound or composition, polynucleotides of the invention can comprise one or more miR binding sequences that bind to one or more miRNAs expressed in conventional immune cells or any cell that expresses TLR7 and/or TLR8 and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines (e.g., in immune cells of peripheral lymphoid organs and/or splenocytes and/or endothelial cells). It has now been discovered that incorporation into an mRNA of one or more miR binding sites reduces or inhibits accelerated blood clearance (ABC) of the lipid-comprising compound or composition for use in delivering the mRNA. Furthermore, it has now been discovered that incorporation of one or more miR binding sites into an mRNA reduces serum levels of anti-PEG anti-IgM (e.g., reduces or inhibits the acute production of IgMs that recognize polyethylene glycol (PEG) by B cells) and/or reduces or inhibits proliferation and/or activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells following administration of a lipid-comprising compound or composition comprising the mRNA.

In some embodiments, miR sequences may correspond to any known microRNA expressed in immune cells, including but not limited to those taught in US Publication US2005/0261218 and US Publication US2005/0059005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In the polynucleotides of the invention, miRNA binding sites that are involved in such processes can be removed or introduced, to tailor the expression of the polynucleotides to biologically relevant cell types or relevant biological processes. In this context, the polynucleotides of the invention are defined as auxotrophic polynucleotides.

In one embodiment, the 3′ UTR comprises two miRNA binding sites, wherein a first miRNA binding site binds to miR-142 and a second miRNA binding site binds to miR-126. In a specific embodiment, the 3′ UTR binding to miR-142 and miR-126 comprises, consists, or consists essentially of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 163.

In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site is inserted in the polynucleotide of the invention in any position of the polynucleotide (e.g., the 5′ UTR and/or 3′ UTR). In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR comprises a miRNA binding site. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a miRNA binding site. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR and the 3′ UTR comprise a miRNA binding site. The insertion site in the polynucleotide can be anywhere in the polynucleotide as long as the insertion of the miRNA binding site in the polynucleotide does not interfere with the translation of a functional polypeptide in the absence of the corresponding miRNA; and in the presence of the miRNA, the insertion of the miRNA binding site in the polynucleotide and the binding of the miRNA binding site to the corresponding miRNA are capable of degrading the polynucleotide or preventing the translation of the polynucleotide.

In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site is inserted in at least about 30 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon of an ORF in a polynucleotide of the invention comprising the ORF.

In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site is inserted within the 3′ UTR immediately following the stop codon of the coding region within the polynucleotide of the invention, e.g., mRNA. In some embodiments, if there are multiple copies of a stop codon in the construct, a miRNA binding site is inserted immediately following the final stop codon. In some embodiments, a miRNA binding site is inserted further downstream of the stop codon, in which case there are 3′ UTR bases between the stop codon and the miR binding site(s). In some embodiments, three non-limiting examples of possible insertion sites for a miR in a 3′ UTR are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 162, 163, and 164, which show a 3′ UTR sequence with a miR-142-3p site inserted in one of three different possible insertion sites, respectively, within the 3′ UTR.

In another embodiment, the codon optimized open reading frame encoding the polypeptide of interest comprises a stop codon and the at least one microRNA binding site for a miR expressed in immune cells is located within the 3′ UTR at least 50 nucleotides after the stop codon. In other embodiments, the codon optimized open reading frame encoding the polypeptide of interest comprises a stop codon and the at least one microRNA binding site for a miR expressed in immune cells is located within the 3′ UTR immediately after the stop codon, or within the 3′ UTR 15-20 nucleotides after the stop codon or within the 3′ UTR 70-80 nucleotides after the stop codon. In other embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises more than one miRNA binding site (e.g., 2-4 miRNA binding sites), wherein there can be a spacer region (e.g., of 10-100, 20-70 or 30-50 nucleotides in length) between each miRNA binding site. In another embodiment, the 3′ UTR comprises a spacer region between the end of the miRNA binding site(s) and the poly A tail nucleotides. For example, a spacer region of 10-100, 20-70 or 30-50 nucleotides in length can be situated between the end of the miRNA binding site(s) and the beginning of the poly A tail.

In one embodiment, a codon optimized open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of interest comprises a start codon and the at least one microRNA binding site is located within the 5′ UTR 1-100 nucleotides before (upstream of) the start codon.

In other embodiments, the codon optimized open reading frame encoding the polypeptide of interest comprises a start codon and the at least one microRNA binding site for a miR expressed in immune cells is located within the 5′ UTR immediately before the start codon, or within the 5′ UTR 15-20 nucleotides before the start codon or within the 5′ UTR 70-80 nucleotides before the start codon. In other embodiments, the 5′ UTR comprises more than one miRNA binding site (e.g., 2-4 miRNA binding sites), wherein there can be a spacer region (e.g., of 10-100, 20-70 or 30-50 nucleotides in length) between each miRNA binding site.

In one embodiment, the 3′ UTR comprises more than one stop codon, wherein at least one miRNA binding site is positioned downstream of the stop codons. For example, a 3′ UTR can comprise 1, 2 or 3 stop codons. Non-limiting examples of triple stop codons that can be used include: UGAUAAUAG (SEQ ID NO:124), UGAUAGUAA (SEQ ID NO:125), UAAUGAUAG (SEQ ID NO:126), UGAUAAUAA (SEQ ID NO:127), UGAUAGUAG (SEQ ID NO:128), UAAUGAUGA (SEQ ID NO:129), UAAUAGUAG (SEQ ID NO:130), UGAUGAUGA (SEQ ID NO:131), UAAUAAUAA (SEQ ID NO:132), and UAGUAGUAG (SEQ ID NO:133).

When the 3′ UTR comprises multiple miRNA binding sites, these binding sites can be positioned directly next to each other in the construct (i.e., one after the other) or, alternatively, spacer nucleotides can be positioned between each binding site.

In one embodiment, the 3′ UTR comprises three stop codons with a single miR-142-3p binding site located downstream of the 3rd stop codon. Non-limiting examples of sequences of 3′ UTR having three stop codons and a single miR-142-3p binding site located at different positions downstream of the final stop codon are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 151, 162, 163, and 164.

In one embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention comprises a 5′ UTR, a codon optimized open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of interest, a 3′ UTR comprising the at least one miRNA binding site for a miR expressed in immune cells, and a 3′ tailing region of linked nucleosides. In various embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises 1-4, at least two, one, two, three or four miRNA binding sites for miRs expressed in immune cells, preferably abundantly or preferentially expressed in immune cells.

In one embodiment, the at least one miRNA expressed in immune cells is a miR-142-3p microRNA binding site.

Non-limiting exemplary sequences for miRs to which a microRNA binding site(s) of the disclosure can bind include the following: miR-142-3p (SEQ ID NO: 115), miR-142-5p (SEQ ID NO: 117), miR-146-3p (SEQ ID NO: 135), miR-146-5p (SEQ ID NO: 136), miR-155-3p (SEQ ID NO: 137), miR-155-5p (SEQ ID NO: 138), miR-126-3p (SEQ ID NO: 120), miR-126-5p (SEQ ID NO: 122), miR-16-3p (SEQ ID NO: 139), miR-16-5p (SEQ ID NO: 140), miR-21-3p (SEQ ID NO: 141), miR-21-5p (SEQ ID NO: 142), miR-223-3p (SEQ ID NO: 143), miR-223-5p (SEQ ID NO: 144), miR-24-3p (SEQ ID NO: 145), miR-24-5p (SEQ ID NO: 146), miR-27-3p (SEQ ID NO: 147) and miR-27-5p (SEQ ID NO: 148). Other suitable miR sequences expressed in immune cells (e.g., abundantly or preferentially expressed in immune cells) are known and available in the art, for example at the University of Manchester's microRNA database, miRBase. Sites that bind any of the aforementioned miRs can be designed based on Watson-Crick complementarity to the miR, typically 100% complementarity to the miR, and inserted into an mRNA construct of the disclosure as described herein.

In another embodiment, a polynucleotide of the present invention (e.g., and mRNA, e.g., the 3′ UTR thereof) can comprise at least one miRNA binding site to thereby reduce or inhibit accelerated blood clearance, for example by reducing or inhibiting production of IgMs, e.g., against PEG, by B cells and/or reducing or inhibiting proliferation and/or activation of pDCs, and can comprise at least one miRNA binding site for modulating tissue expression of an encoded protein of interest.

miRNA gene regulation can be influenced by the sequence surrounding the miRNA such as, but not limited to, the species of the surrounding sequence, the type of sequence (e.g., heterologous, homologous, exogenous, endogenous, or artificial), regulatory elements in the surrounding sequence and/or structural elements in the surrounding sequence. The miRNA can be influenced by the 5′UTR and/or 3′UTR. As a non-limiting example, a non-human 3′UTR can increase the regulatory effect of the miRNA sequence on the expression of a polypeptide of interest compared to a human 3′ UTR of the same sequence type.

In one embodiment, other regulatory elements and/or structural elements of the 5′ UTR can influence miRNA mediated gene regulation. One example of a regulatory element and/or structural element is a structured IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) in the 5′ UTR, which is necessary for the binding of translational elongation factors to initiate protein translation. EIF4A2 binding to this secondarily structured element in the 5′-UTR is necessary for miRNA mediated gene expression (Meijer H A et al., Science, 2013, 340, 82-85, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The polynucleotides of the invention can further include this structured 5′ UTR to enhance microRNA mediated gene regulation.

At least one miRNA binding site can be engineered into the 3′ UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention. In this context, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, at least ten, or more miRNA binding sites can be engineered into a 3′ UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention. For example, 1 to 10, 1 to 9, 1 to 8, 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 2, or 1 miRNA binding sites can be engineered into the 3′UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention. In one embodiment, miRNA binding sites incorporated into a polynucleotide of the invention can be the same or can be different miRNA sites. A combination of different miRNA binding sites incorporated into a polynucleotide of the invention can include combinations in which more than one copy of any of the different miRNA sites are incorporated. In another embodiment, miRNA binding sites incorporated into a polynucleotide of the invention can target the same or different tissues in the body. As a non-limiting example, through the introduction of tissue-, cell-type-, or disease-specific miRNA binding sites in the 3′-UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention, the degree of expression in specific cell types (e.g., myeloid cells, endothelial cells, etc.) can be reduced.

In one embodiment, a miRNA binding site can be engineered near the 5′ terminus of the 3′UTR, about halfway between the 5′ terminus and 3′ terminus of the 3′UTR and/or near the 3′ terminus of the 3′ UTR in a polynucleotide of the invention. As a non-limiting example, a miRNA binding site can be engineered near the 5′ terminus of the 3′UTR and about halfway between the 5′ terminus and 3′ terminus of the 3′UTR. As another non-limiting example, a miRNA binding site can be engineered near the 3′ terminus of the 3′UTR and about halfway between the 5′ terminus and 3′ terminus of the 3′ UTR. In another non-limiting example, a miRNA binding site can be engineered near the 5′ terminus of the 3′ UTR and near the 3′ terminus of the 3′ UTR.

In another embodiment, a 3′UTR can comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 miRNA binding sites. The miRNA binding sites can be complementary to a miRNA, miRNA seed sequence, and/or miRNA sequences flanking the seed sequence.

In some embodiments, the expression of a polynucleotide of the invention can be controlled by incorporating at least one sensor sequence in the polynucleotide and formulating the polynucleotide for administration. As a non-limiting example, a polynucleotide of the invention can be targeted to a tissue or cell by incorporating a miRNA binding site and formulating the polynucleotide in a lipid nanoparticle comprising a ionizable lipid, including any of the lipids described herein.

A polynucleotide of the invention can be engineered for more targeted expression in specific tissues, cell types, or biological conditions based on the expression patterns of miRNAs in the different tissues, cell types, or biological conditions. Through introduction of tissue-specific miRNA binding sites, a polynucleotide of the invention can be designed for optimal protein expression in a tissue or cell, or in the context of a biological condition.

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the invention can be designed to incorporate miRNA binding sites that either have 100% identity to known miRNA seed sequences or have less than 100% identity to miRNA seed sequences. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the invention can be designed to incorporate miRNA binding sites that have at least: 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity to known miRNA seed sequences. The miRNA seed sequence can be partially mutated to decrease miRNA binding affinity and as such result in reduced down modulation of the polynucleotide. In essence, the degree of match or mis-match between the miRNA binding site and the miRNA seed can act as a rheostat to more finely tune the ability of the miRNA to modulate protein expression. In addition, mutation in the non-seed region of a miRNA binding site can also impact the ability of a miRNA to modulate protein expression.

In one embodiment, a miRNA sequence can be incorporated into the loop of a stem loop.

In another embodiment, a miRNA seed sequence can be incorporated in the loop of a stem loop and a miRNA binding site can be incorporated into the 5′ or 3′ stem of the stem loop.

In one embodiment the miRNA sequence in the 5′ UTR can be used to stabilize a polynucleotide of the invention described herein.

In another embodiment, a miRNA sequence in the 5′ UTR of a polynucleotide of the invention can be used to decrease the accessibility of the site of translation initiation such as, but not limited to a start codon. See, e.g., Matsuda et al., PLoS One. 2010 11(5):e15057; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which used antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides and exon junction complexes (EJCs) around a start codon (−4 to +37 where the A of the AUG codons is +1) to decrease the accessibility to the first start codon (AUG). Matsuda showed that altering the sequence around the start codon with an LNA or EJC affected the efficiency, length and structural stability of a polynucleotide. A polynucleotide of the invention can comprise a miRNA sequence, instead of the LNA or EJC sequence described by Matsuda et al, near the site of translation initiation to decrease the accessibility to the site of translation initiation. The site of translation initiation can be prior to, after or within the miRNA sequence. As a non-limiting example, the site of translation initiation can be located within a miRNA sequence such as a seed sequence or binding site.

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the invention can include at least one miRNA to dampen the antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells. The miRNA can be the complete miRNA sequence, the miRNA seed sequence, the miRNA sequence without the seed, or a combination thereof. As a non-limiting example, a miRNA incorporated into a polynucleotide of the invention can be specific to the hematopoietic system.

**12. 3′ UTRs**

In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide of the invention) further comprises a 3′ UTR.

3′-UTR is the section of mRNA that immediately follows the translation termination codon and often contains regulatory regions that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression. Regulatory regions within the 3′-UTR can influence polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, and stability of the mRNA. In one embodiment, the 3′-UTR useful for the invention comprises a binding site for regulatory proteins or microRNAs.

In certain embodiments, the 3′ UTR useful for the polynucleotides of the invention comprises a 3′ UTR selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 4, 104 to 113, 150, and 175, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 111, 112, or 113 or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 111. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 112. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 113. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 150. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 175. In some embodiments, the 3′ UTR comprises a nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:212.

In certain embodiments, the 3′ UTR sequence useful for the invention comprises a nucleotide sequence at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or about 100% identical to a sequence selected from the group consisting of 3′ UTR sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:111, SEQ ID NO:150, SEQ ID NO:175, SEQ ID NO:177, SEQ ID NO:178, SEQ ID NO:212, or SEQ ID NO:213, or any combination thereof

**13. Regions Having a 5′ Cap**

The disclosure also includes a polynucleotide that comprises both a 5′ Cap and a polynucleotide of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide).

The 5′ cap structure of a natural mRNA is involved in nuclear export, increasing mRNA stability and binds the mRNA Cap Binding Protein (CBP), which is responsible for mRNA stability in the cell and translation competency through the association of CBP with poly(A) binding protein to form the mature cyclic mRNA species. The cap further assists the removal of 5′ proximal introns during mRNA splicing.

Endogenous mRNA molecules can be 5′-end capped generating a 5′-ppp-5′-triphosphate linkage between a terminal guanosine cap residue and the 5′-terminal transcribed sense nucleotide of the mRNA molecule. This 5′-guanylate cap can then be methylated to generate an N7-methyl-guanylate residue. The ribose sugars of the terminal and/or ante-terminal transcribed nucleotides of the 5′ end of the mRNA can optionally also be 2′-O-methylated. 5′-decapping through hydrolysis and cleavage of the guanylate cap structure can target a nucleic acid molecule, such as an mRNA molecule, for degradation.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) incorporate a cap moiety.

In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) comprise a non-hydrolyzable cap structure preventing decapping and thus increasing mRNA half-life. Because cap structure hydrolysis requires cleavage of 5′-ppp-5′ phosphorodiester linkages, modified nucleotides can be used during the capping reaction. For example, a Vaccinia Capping Enzyme from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.) can be used with α-thio-guanosine nucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions to create a phosphorothioate linkage in the 5′-ppp-5′ cap. Additional modified guanosine nucleotides can be used such as α-methyl-phosphonate and seleno-phosphate nucleotides.

Additional modifications include, but are not limited to, 2′-O-methylation of the ribose sugars of 5′-terminal and/or 5′-anteterminal nucleotides of the polynucleotide (as mentioned above) on the 2′-hydroxyl group of the sugar ring. Multiple distinct 5′-cap structures can be used to generate the 5′-cap of a nucleic acid molecule, such as a polynucleotide that functions as an mRNA molecule. Cap analogs, which herein are also referred to as synthetic cap analogs, chemical caps, chemical cap analogs, or structural or functional cap analogs, differ from natural (i.e., endogenous, wild-type or physiological) 5′-caps in their chemical structure, while retaining cap function. Cap analogs can be chemically (i.e., non-enzymatically) or enzymatically synthesized and/or linked to the polynucleotides of the invention.

For example, the Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (ARCA) cap contains two guanines linked by a 5′-5′-triphosphate group, wherein one guanine contains an N7 methyl group as well as a 3′-O-methyl group (i.e., N7,3′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine (m7G-3′mppp-G; which can equivalently be designated 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G). The 3′-O atom of the other, unmodified, guanine becomes linked to the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the capped polynucleotide. The N7- and 3′-O-methylated guanine provides the terminal moiety of the capped polynucleotide.

Another exemplary cap is mCAP, which is similar to ARCA but has a 2′-O-methyl group on guanosine (i.e., N7,2′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine, m7Gm-ppp-G).

In some embodiments, the cap is a dinucleotide cap analog. As a non-limiting example, the dinucleotide cap analog can be modified at different phosphate positions with a boranophosphate group or a phosphoroselenoate group such as the dinucleotide cap analogs described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,519,110, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In another embodiment, the cap is a cap analog is a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl) substituted dinucleotide form of a cap analog known in the art and/or described herein. Non-limiting examples of a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl) substituted dinucleotide form of a cap analog include a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl)-G(5′)ppp(5′)G and a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl)-m3′-OG(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analog (See, e.g., the various cap analogs and the methods of synthesizing cap analogs described in Kore et al. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2013 21:4570-4574; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, a cap analog of the present invention is a 4-chloro/bromophenoxyethyl analog.

While cap analogs allow for the concomitant capping of a polynucleotide or a region thereof, in an in vitro transcription reaction, up to 20% of transcripts can remain uncapped. This, as well as the structural differences of a cap analog from an endogenous 5′-cap structures of nucleic acids produced by the endogenous, cellular transcription machinery, can lead to reduced translational competency and reduced cellular stability.

Polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) can also be capped post-manufacture (whether IVT or chemical synthesis), using enzymes, to generate more authentic 5′-cap structures. As used herein, the phrase “more authentic” refers to a feature that closely mirrors or mimics, either structurally or functionally, an endogenous or wild type feature. That is, a “more authentic” feature is better representative of an endogenous, wild-type, natural or physiological cellular function and/or structure as compared to synthetic features or analogs, etc., of the prior art, or which outperforms the corresponding endogenous, wild-type, natural or physiological feature in one or more respects. Non-limiting examples of more authentic 5′cap structures of the present invention are those that, among other things, have enhanced binding of cap binding proteins, increased half-life, reduced susceptibility to 5′ endonucleases and/or reduced 5′decapping, as compared to synthetic 5′cap structures known in the art (or to a wild-type, natural or physiological 5′cap structure). For example, recombinant Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and recombinant 2′-O-methyltransferase enzyme can create a canonical 5′-5′-triphosphate linkage between the 5′-terminal nucleotide of a polynucleotide and a guanine cap nucleotide wherein the cap guanine contains an N7 methylation and the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the mRNA contains a 2′-O-methyl. Such a structure is termed the Cap1 structure. This cap results in a higher translational-competency and cellular stability and a reduced activation of cellular pro-inflammatory cytokines, as compared, e.g., to other 5′cap analog structures known in the art. Cap structures include, but are not limited to, 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)N, pN2p (cap 0), 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)NlmpNp (cap 1), and 7mG(5′)-ppp(5′)NlmpN2mp (cap 2).

As a non-limiting example, capping chimeric polynucleotides post-manufacture can be more efficient as nearly 100% of the chimeric polynucleotides can be capped. This is in contrast to ˜80% efficiency when a cap analog is linked to a chimeric polynucleotide during an in vitro transcription reaction.

According to the present invention, 5′ terminal caps can include endogenous caps or cap analogs. According to the present invention, a 5′ terminal cap can comprise a guanine analog. Useful guanine analogs include, but are not limited to, inosine, N1-methyl-guanosine, 2′fluoro-guanosine, 7-deaza-guanosine, 8-oxo-guanosine, 2-amino-guanosine, LNA-guanosine, and 2-azido-guanosine.

**14. Poly-A Tails**

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present disclosure (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) further comprise a poly-A tail. In further embodiments, terminal groups on the poly-A tail can be incorporated for stabilization. In other embodiments, a poly-A tail comprises des-3′ hydroxyl tails.

During RNA processing, a long chain of adenine nucleotides (poly-A tail) can be added to a polynucleotide such as an mRNA molecule to increase stability. Immediately after transcription, the 3′ end of the transcript can be cleaved to free a 3′ hydroxyl. Then poly-A polymerase adds a chain of adenine nucleotides to the RNA. The process, called polyadenylation, adds a poly-A tail that can be between, for example, approximately 80 to approximately 250 residues long, including approximately 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240 or 250 residues long. In one embodiment, the poly-A tail is 100 nucleotides in length (SEQ ID NO:223).

PolyA tails can also be added after the construct is exported from the nucleus.

According to the present invention, terminal groups on the poly A tail can be incorporated for stabilization. Polynucleotides of the present invention can include des-3′ hydroxyl tails. They can also include structural moieties or 2′-Omethyl modifications as taught by Junjie Li, et al. (Current Biology, Vol. 15, 1501-1507, Aug. 23, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

The polynucleotides of the present invention can be designed to encode transcripts with alternative polyA tail structures including histone mRNA. According to Norbury, “Terminal uridylation has also been detected on human replication-dependent histone mRNAs. The turnover of these mRNAs is thought to be important for the prevention of potentially toxic histone accumulation following the completion or inhibition of chromosomal DNA replication. These mRNAs are distinguished by their lack of a 3′ poly(A) tail, the function of which is instead assumed by a stable stem-loop structure and its cognate stem-loop binding protein (SLBP); the latter carries out the same functions as those of PABP on polyadenylated mRNAs” (Norbury, “Cytoplasmic RNA: a case of the tail wagging the dog,” Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology; AOP, published online 29 Aug. 2013; doi:10.1038/nrm3645) the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Unique poly-A tail lengths provide certain advantages to the polynucleotides of the present invention. Generally, the length of a poly-A tail, when present, is greater than 30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the poly-A tail is greater than 35 nucleotides in length (e.g., at least or greater than about 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700, 1,800, 1,900, 2,000, 2,500, and 3,000 nucleotides).

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide or region thereof includes from about 30 to about 3,000 nucleotides (e.g., from 30 to 50, from 30 to 100, from 30 to 250, from 30 to 500, from 30 to 750, from 30 to 1,000, from 30 to 1,500, from 30 to 2,000, from 30 to 2,500, from 50 to 100, from 50 to 250, from 50 to 500, from 50 to 750, from 50 to 1,000, from 50 to 1,500, from 50 to 2,000, from 50 to 2,500, from 50 to 3,000, from 100 to 500, from 100 to 750, from 100 to 1,000, from 100 to 1,500, from 100 to 2,000, from 100 to 2,500, from 100 to 3,000, from 500 to 750, from 500 to 1,000, from 500 to 1,500, from 500 to 2,000, from 500 to 2,500, from 500 to 3,000, from 1,000 to 1,500, from 1,000 to 2,000, from 1,000 to 2,500, from 1,000 to 3,000, from 1,500 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 2,500, from 1,500 to 3,000, from 2,000 to 3,000, from 2,000 to 2,500, and from 2,500 to 3,000).

In some embodiments, the poly-A tail is designed relative to the length of the overall polynucleotide or the length of a particular region of the polynucleotide. This design can be based on the length of a coding region, the length of a particular feature or region or based on the length of the ultimate product expressed from the polynucleotides.

In this context, the poly-A tail can be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% greater in length than the polynucleotide or feature thereof. The poly-A tail can also be designed as a fraction of the polynucleotides to which it belongs. In this context, the poly-A tail can be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% or more of the total length of the construct, a construct region or the total length of the construct minus the poly-A tail. Further, engineered binding sites and conjugation of polynucleotides for Poly-A binding protein can enhance expression.

Additionally, multiple distinct polynucleotides can be linked together via the PABP (Poly-A binding protein) through the 3′-end using modified nucleotides at the 3′-terminus of the poly-A tail. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines at and protein production can be assayed by ELISA at 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and day 7 post-transfection.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention are designed to include a polyA-G Quartet region. The G-quartet is a cyclic hydrogen bonded array of four guanine nucleotides that can be formed by G-rich sequences in both DNA and RNA. In this embodiment, the G-quartet is incorporated at the end of the poly-A tail. The resultant polynucleotide is assayed for stability, protein production and other parameters including half-life at various time points. It has been discovered that the polyA-G quartet results in protein production from an mRNA equivalent to at least 75% of that seen using a poly-A tail of 120 nucleotides alone (SEQ ID NO:233).

**15. Start Codon Region**

The invention also includes a polynucleotide that comprises both a start codon region and the polynucleotide described herein (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide). In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention can have regions that are analogous to or function like a start codon region.

In some embodiments, the translation of a polynucleotide can initiate on a codon that is not the start codon AUG. Translation of the polynucleotide can initiate on an alternative start codon such as, but not limited to, ACG, AGG, AAG, CTG/CUG, GTG/GUG, ATA/AUA, ATT/AUU, TTG/UUG (see Touriol et al. Biology of the Cell 95 (2003) 169-178 and Matsuda and Mauro PLoS ONE, 2010 5:11; the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

As a non-limiting example, the translation of a polynucleotide begins on the alternative start codon ACG. As another non-limiting example, polynucleotide translation begins on the alternative start codon CTG or CUG. As another non-limiting example, the translation of a polynucleotide begins on the alternative start codon GTG or GUG.

Nucleotides flanking a codon that initiates translation such as, but not limited to, a start codon or an alternative start codon, are known to affect the translation efficiency, the length and/or the structure of the polynucleotide. (See, e.g., Matsuda and Mauro PLoS ONE, 2010 5:11; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Masking any of the nucleotides flanking a codon that initiates translation can be used to alter the position of translation initiation, translation efficiency, length and/or structure of a polynucleotide.

In some embodiments, a masking agent can be used near the start codon or alternative start codon to mask or hide the codon to reduce the probability of translation initiation at the masked start codon or alternative start codon. Non-limiting examples of masking agents include antisense locked nucleic acids (LNA) polynucleotides and exon junction complexes (EJCs) (See, e.g., Matsuda and Mauro describing masking agents LNA polynucleotides and EJCs (PLoS ONE, 2010 5:11); the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

In another embodiment, a masking agent can be used to mask a start codon of a polynucleotide to increase the likelihood that translation will initiate on an alternative start codon. In some embodiments, a masking agent can be used to mask a first start codon or alternative start codon to increase the chance that translation will initiate on a start codon or alternative start codon downstream to the masked start codon or alternative start codon.

In some embodiments, a start codon or alternative start codon can be located within a perfect complement for a miRNA binding site. The perfect complement of a miRNA binding site can help control the translation, length and/or structure of the polynucleotide similar to a masking agent. As a non-limiting example, the start codon or alternative start codon can be located in the middle of a perfect complement for a miRNA binding site. The start codon or alternative start codon can be located after the first nucleotide, second nucleotide, third nucleotide, fourth nucleotide, fifth nucleotide, sixth nucleotide, seventh nucleotide, eighth nucleotide, ninth nucleotide, tenth nucleotide, eleventh nucleotide, twelfth nucleotide, thirteenth nucleotide, fourteenth nucleotide, fifteenth nucleotide, sixteenth nucleotide, seventeenth nucleotide, eighteenth nucleotide, nineteenth nucleotide, twentieth nucleotide or twenty-first nucleotide.

In another embodiment, the start codon of a polynucleotide can be removed from the polynucleotide sequence to have the translation of the polynucleotide begin on a codon that is not the start codon. Translation of the polynucleotide can begin on the codon following the removed start codon or on a downstream start codon or an alternative start codon. In a non-limiting example, the start codon ATG or AUG is removed as the first 3 nucleotides of the polynucleotide sequence to have translation initiate on a downstream start codon or alternative start codon. The polynucleotide sequence where the start codon was removed can further comprise at least one masking agent for the downstream start codon and/or alternative start codons to control or attempt to control the initiation of translation, the length of the polynucleotide and/or the structure of the polynucleotide.

**16. Stop Codon Region**

The invention also includes a polynucleotide that comprises both a stop codon region and the polynucleotide described herein (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide). In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention can include at least two stop codons before the 3′ untranslated region (UTR). The stop codon can be selected from TGA, TAA and TAG in the case of DNA, or from UGA, UAA and UAG in the case of RNA. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention include the stop codon TGA in the case or DNA, or the stop codon UGA in the case of RNA, and one additional stop codon. In a further embodiment the addition stop codon can be TAA or UAA. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides of the present invention include three consecutive stop codons, four stop codons, or more.

**17. Polynucleotide Comprising an mRNA Encoding a G6PC Polypeptide**

In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present disclosure, for example a polynucleotide comprising an mRNA nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide, comprises from 5′ to 3′ end:

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present disclosure comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide sequence at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to the protein sequence of a wild type human G6PC (SEQ ID NO:199) or a variant thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:194-198, 200-206, 208, and 209).

In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present disclosure, for example a polynucleotide comprising an mRNA nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide, comprises (1) a 5′ cap provided above, for example, CAP1, (2) a 5′ UTR, (3) a nucleotide sequence ORF selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:8, 11-20, 22-38, and 207, (3) a stop codon, (4) a 3′UTR, and (5) a poly-A tail provided above, for example, a poly-A tail of about 100 residues.

**18. Methods of Making Polynucleotides**

The present disclosure also provides methods for making a polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) or a complement thereof.

In some aspects, a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) disclosed herein, and encoding a G6PC polypeptide, can be constructed using in vitro transcription (IVT). In other aspects, a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) disclosed herein, and encoding a G6PC polypeptide, can be constructed by chemical synthesis using an oligonucleotide synthesizer.

In other aspects, a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) disclosed herein, and encoding a G6PC polypeptide is made by using a host cell. In certain aspects, a polynucleotide (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) disclosed herein, and encoding a G6PC polypeptide is made by one or more combination of the IVT, chemical synthesis, host cell expression, or any other methods known in the art.

Naturally occurring nucleosides, non-naturally occurring nucleosides, or combinations thereof, can totally or partially naturally replace occurring nucleosides present in the candidate nucleotide sequence and can be incorporated into a sequence-optimized nucleotide sequence (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) encoding a G6PC polypeptide. The resultant polynucleotides, e.g., mRNAs, can then be examined for their ability to produce protein and/or produce a therapeutic outcome.

a. In Vitro Transcription/Enzymatic Synthesis

The polynucleotides of the present invention disclosed herein (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) can be transcribed using an in vitro transcription (IVT) system. The system typically comprises a transcription buffer, nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), an RNase inhibitor and a polymerase. The NTPs can be selected from, but are not limited to, those described herein including natural and unnatural (modified) NTPs. The polymerase can be selected from, but is not limited to, T7 RNA polymerase, T3 RNA polymerase and mutant polymerases such as, but not limited to, polymerases able to incorporate polynucleotides disclosed herein. See U.S. Publ. No. US20130259923, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Any number of RNA polymerases or variants can be used in the synthesis of the polynucleotides of the present invention. RNA polymerases can be modified by inserting or deleting amino acids of the RNA polymerase sequence. As a non-limiting example, the RNA polymerase can be modified to exhibit an increased ability to incorporate a 2′-modified nucleotide triphosphate compared to an unmodified RNA polymerase (see International Publication WO2008078180 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,101,385; herein incorporated by reference in their entireties).

Variants can be obtained by evolving an RNA polymerase, optimizing the RNA polymerase amino acid and/or nucleic acid sequence and/or by using other methods known in the art. As a non-limiting example, T7 RNA polymerase variants can be evolved using the continuous directed evolution system set out by Esvelt et al. (Nature 472:499-503 (2011); herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) where clones of T7 RNA polymerase can encode at least one mutation such as, but not limited to, lysine at position 93 substituted for threonine (K93T), I4M, A7T, E63V, V64D, A65E, D66Y, T76N, C125R, S128R, A136T, N165S, G175R, H176L, Y178H, F182L, L196F, G198V, D208Y, E222K, S228A, Q239R, T243N, G259D, M267I, G280C, H300R, D351A, A354S, E356D, L360P, A383V, Y385C, D388Y, S397R, M401T, N410S, K450R, P451T, G452V, E484A, H523L, H524N, G542V, E565K, K577E, K577M, N601S, S684Y, L699I, K713E, N748D, Q754R, E775K, A827V, D851N or L864F. As another non-limiting example, T7 RNA polymerase variants can encode at least mutation as described in U.S. Pub. Nos. 20100120024 and 20070117112; herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Variants of RNA polymerase can also include, but are not limited to, substitutional variants, conservative amino acid substitution, insertional variants, and/or deletional variants.

In one aspect, the polynucleotide can be designed to be recognized by the wild type or variant RNA polymerases. In doing so, the polynucleotide can be modified to contain sites or regions of sequence changes from the wild type or parent chimeric polynucleotide.

Polynucleotide or nucleic acid synthesis reactions can be carried out by enzymatic methods utilizing polymerases. Polymerases catalyze the creation of phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in a polynucleotide or nucleic acid chain. Currently known DNA polymerases can be divided into different families based on amino acid sequence comparison and crystal structure analysis. DNA polymerase I (pol I) or A polymerase family, including the Klenow fragments of E. coli, Bacillus DNA polymerase I, Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerases, and the T7 RNA and DNA polymerases, is among the best studied of these families. Another large family is DNA polymerase α (pol α) or B polymerase family, including all eukaryotic replicating DNA polymerases and polymerases from phages T4 and RB69. Although they employ similar catalytic mechanism, these families of polymerases differ in substrate specificity, substrate analog-incorporating efficiency, degree and rate for primer extension, mode of DNA synthesis, exonuclease activity, and sensitivity against inhibitors.

DNA polymerases are also selected based on the optimum reaction conditions they require, such as reaction temperature, pH, and template and primer concentrations. Sometimes a combination of more than one DNA polymerases is employed to achieve the desired DNA fragment size and synthesis efficiency. For example, Cheng et al. increase pH, add glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide, decrease denaturation times, increase extension times, and utilize a secondary thermostable DNA polymerase that possesses a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity to effectively amplify long targets from cloned inserts and human genomic DNA. (Cheng et al., PNAS 91:5695-5699 (1994), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). RNA polymerases from bacteriophage T3, T7, and SP6 have been widely used to prepare RNAs for biochemical and biophysical studies. RNA polymerases, capping enzymes, and poly-A polymerases are disclosed in the co-pending International Publication No. WO2014/028429, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In one aspect, the RNA polymerase which can be used in the synthesis of the polynucleotides of the present invention is a Syn5 RNA polymerase. (see Zhu et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2013, doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1193, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The Syn5 RNA polymerase was recently characterized from marine cyanophage Syn5 by Zhu et al. where they also identified the promoter sequence (see Zhu et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2013, the contents of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Zhu et al. found that Syn5 RNA polymerase catalyzed RNA synthesis over a wider range of temperatures and salinity as compared to T7 RNA polymerase. Additionally, the requirement for the initiating nucleotide at the promoter was found to be less stringent for Syn5 RNA polymerase as compared to the T7 RNA polymerase making Syn5 RNA polymerase promising for RNA synthesis.

In one aspect, a Syn5 RNA polymerase can be used in the synthesis of the polynucleotides described herein. As a non-limiting example, a Syn5 RNA polymerase can be used in the synthesis of the polynucleotide requiring a precise 3′-terminus.

In one aspect, a Syn5 promoter can be used in the synthesis of the polynucleotides. As a non-limiting example, the Syn5 promoter can be 5′-ATTGGGCACCCGTAAGGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 185 as described by Zhu et al. (Nucleic Acids Research 2013).

In one aspect, a Syn5 RNA polymerase can be used in the synthesis of polynucleotides comprising at least one chemical modification described herein and/or known in the art (see e.g., the incorporation of pseudo-UTP and 5Me-CTP described in Zhu et al. Nucleic Acids Research 2013).

In one aspect, the polynucleotides described herein can be synthesized using a Syn5 RNA polymerase which has been purified using modified and improved purification procedure described by Zhu et al. (Nucleic Acids Research 2013).

Various tools in genetic engineering are based on the enzymatic amplification of a target gene which acts as a template. For the study of sequences of individual genes or specific regions of interest and other research needs, it is necessary to generate multiple copies of a target gene from a small sample of polynucleotides or nucleic acids. Such methods can be applied in the manufacture of the polynucleotides of the invention.

For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), strand displacement amplification (SDA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), also called transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and/or rolling-circle amplification (RCA) can be utilized in the manufacture of one or more regions of the polynucleotides of the present invention. Assembling polynucleotides or nucleic acids by a ligase is also widely used.

b. Chemical Synthesis

Standard methods can be applied to synthesize an isolated polynucleotide sequence encoding an isolated polypeptide of interest, such as a polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide). For example, a single DNA or RNA oligomer containing a codon-optimized nucleotide sequence coding for the particular isolated polypeptide can be synthesized. In other aspects, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide can be synthesized and then ligated. In some aspects, the individual oligonucleotides typically contain 5′ or 3′ overhangs for complementary assembly.

A polynucleotide disclosed herein (e.g., a RNA, e.g., an mRNA) can be chemically synthesized using chemical synthesis methods and potential nucleobase substitutions known in the art. See, for example, International Publication Nos. WO2014093924, WO2013052523; WO2013039857, WO2012135805, WO2013151671; U.S. Publ. No. US20130115272; or U.S. Pat. No. 8,999,380 or 8,710,200, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

c. Purification of Polynucleotides Encoding G6PC

Purification of the polynucleotides described herein (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) can include, but is not limited to, polynucleotide clean-up, quality assurance and quality control. Clean-up can be performed by methods known in the arts such as, but not limited to, AGENCOURT® beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, Mass.), poly-T beads, LNA™ oligo-T capture probes (EXIQON® Inc., Vedbaek, Denmark) or HPLC based purification methods such as, but not limited to, strong anion exchange HPLC, weak anion exchange HPLC, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC).

The term “purified” when used in relation to a polynucleotide such as a “purified polynucleotide” refers to one that is separated from at least one contaminant. As used herein, a “contaminant” is any substance that makes another unfit, impure or inferior. Thus, a purified polynucleotide (e.g., DNA and RNA) is present in a form or setting different from that in which it is found in nature, or a form or setting different from that which existed prior to subjecting it to a treatment or purification method.

In some embodiments, purification of a polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) removes impurities that can reduce or remove an unwanted immune response, e.g., reducing cytokine activity.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) is purified prior to administration using column chromatography (e.g., strong anion exchange HPLC, weak anion exchange HPLC, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC), or (LCMS)).

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence a G6PC polypeptide) purified using column chromatography (e.g., strong anion exchange HPLC, weak anion exchange HPLC, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC, hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC), or (LCMS)) presents increased expression of the encoded G6PC protein compared to the expression level obtained with the same polynucleotide of the present disclosure purified by a different purification method.

In some embodiments, a column chromatography (e.g., strong anion exchange HPLC, weak anion exchange HPLC, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC), or (LCMS)) purified polynucleotide comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide comprising one or more of the point mutations known in the art.

In some embodiments, the use of RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide increases G6PC protein expression levels in cells when introduced into those cells, e.g., by 10-100%, i.e., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 100% with respect to the expression levels of G6PC protein in the cells before the RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells, or after a non-RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells.

In some embodiments, the use of RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide increases functional G6PC protein expression levels in cells when introduced into those cells, e.g., by 10-100%, i.e., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 100% with respect to the functional expression levels of G6PC protein in the cells before the RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells, or after a non-RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells.

In some embodiments, the use of RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide increases detectable G6PC activity in cells when introduced into those cells, e.g., by 10-100%, i.e., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 100% with respect to the activity levels of functional G6PC in the cells before the RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells, or after a non-RP-HPLC purified polynucleotide was introduced in the cells.

In some embodiments, the purified polynucleotide is at least about 80% pure, at least about 85% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, at least about 96% pure, at least about 97% pure, at least about 98% pure, at least about 99% pure, or about 100% pure.

A quality assurance and/or quality control check can be conducted using methods such as, but not limited to, gel electrophoresis, UV absorbance, or analytical HPLC. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide can be sequenced by methods including, but not limited to reverse-transcriptase-PCR.

d. Quantification of Expressed Polynucleotides Encoding G6PC

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide), their expression products, as well as degradation products and metabolites can be quantified according to methods known in the art.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotides of the present invention can be quantified in exosomes or when derived from one or more bodily fluid. As used herein “bodily fluids” include peripheral blood, serum, plasma, ascites, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sputum, saliva, bone marrow, synovial fluid, aqueous humor, amniotic fluid, cerumen, breast milk, broncheoalveolar lavage fluid, semen, prostatic fluid, cowper's fluid or pre-ejaculatory fluid, sweat, fecal matter, hair, tears, cyst fluid, pleural and peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, lymph, chyme, chyle, bile, interstitial fluid, menses, pus, sebum, vomit, vaginal secretions, mucosal secretion, stool water, pancreatic juice, lavage fluids from sinus cavities, bronchopulmonary aspirates, blastocyl cavity fluid, and umbilical cord blood. Alternatively, exosomes can be retrieved from an organ selected from the group consisting of lung, heart, pancreas, stomach, intestine, bladder, kidney, ovary, testis, skin, colon, breast, prostate, brain, esophagus, liver, and placenta.

In the exosome quantification method, a sample of not more than 2 mL is obtained from the subject and the exosomes isolated by size exclusion chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation, nanomembrane ultrafiltration, immunoabsorbent capture, affinity purification, microfluidic separation, or combinations thereof. In the analysis, the level or concentration of a polynucleotide can be an expression level, presence, absence, truncation or alteration of the administered construct. It is advantageous to correlate the level with one or more clinical phenotypes or with an assay for a human disease biomarker.

The assay can be performed using construct specific probes, cytometry, qRT-PCR, real-time PCR, PCR, flow cytometry, electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, or combinations thereof while the exosomes can be isolated using immunohistochemical methods such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Exosomes can also be isolated by size exclusion chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation, nanomembrane ultrafiltration, immunoabsorbent capture, affinity purification, microfluidic separation, or combinations thereof.

These methods afford the investigator the ability to monitor, in real time, the level of polynucleotides remaining or delivered. This is possible because the polynucleotides of the present invention differ from the endogenous forms due to the structural or chemical modifications.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide can be quantified using methods such as, but not limited to, ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis). A non-limiting example of a UV/Vis spectrometer is a NANODROP® spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass.). The quantified polynucleotide can be analyzed to determine if the polynucleotide can be of proper size, check that no degradation of the polynucleotide has occurred. Degradation of the polynucleotide can be checked by methods such as, but not limited to, agarose gel electrophoresis, HPLC based purification methods such as, but not limited to, strong anion exchange HPLC, weak anion exchange HPLC, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), capillary electrophoresis (CE) and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE).

**Phospholipids**

The lipid composition of the lipid nanoparticle composition disclosed herein can comprise one or more phospholipids, for example, one or more saturated or (poly)unsaturated phospholipids or a combination thereof. In general, phospholipids comprise a phospholipid moiety and one or more fatty acid moieties.

A phospholipid moiety can be selected, for example, from the non-limiting group consisting of phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidic acid, 2-lysophosphatidyl choline, and a sphingomyelin.

A fatty acid moiety can be selected, for example, from the non-limiting group consisting of lauric acid, myristic acid, myristoleic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, erucic acid, phytanoic acid, arachidic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, behenic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid.

Particular phospholipids can facilitate fusion to a membrane. For example, a cationic phospholipid can interact with one or more negatively charged phospholipids of a membrane (e.g., a cellular or intracellular membrane). Fusion of a phospholipid to a membrane can allow one or more elements (e.g., a therapeutic agent) of a lipid-containing composition (e.g., LNPs) to pass through the membrane permitting, e.g., delivery of the one or more elements to a target tissue.

Non-natural phospholipid species including natural species with modifications and substitutions including branching, oxidation, cyclization, and alkynes are also contemplated. For example, a phospholipid can be functionalized with or cross-linked to one or more alkynes (e.g., an alkenyl group in which one or more double bonds is replaced with a triple bond). Under appropriate reaction conditions, an alkyne group can undergo a copper-catalyzed cycloaddition upon exposure to an azide.

(vii) Nanoparticle Compositions

In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are formulated as lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Accordingly, the present disclosure also provides nanoparticle compositions comprising (i) a lipid composition comprising a delivery agent such as compound as described herein, and (ii) a polynucleotide encoding a G6PC polypeptide. In such nanoparticle composition, the lipid composition disclosed herein can encapsulate the polynucleotide encoding a G6PC polypeptide.

Nanoparticle compositions are typically sized on the order of micrometers or smaller and can include a lipid bilayer. Nanoparticle compositions encompass lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposomes (e.g., lipid vesicles), and lipoplexes. For example, a nanoparticle composition can be a liposome having a lipid bilayer with a diameter of 500 nm or less.

Nanoparticle compositions include, for example, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposomes, and lipoplexes. In some embodiments, nanoparticle compositions are vesicles including one or more lipid bilayers. In certain embodiments, a nanoparticle composition includes two or more concentric bilayers separated by aqueous compartments. Lipid bilayers can be functionalized and/or crosslinked to one another. Lipid bilayers can include one or more ligands, proteins, or channels.

In one embodiment, a lipid nanoparticle comprises an ionizable lipid, a structural lipid, a phospholipid, and mRNA. In some embodiments, the LNP comprises an ionizable lipid, a PEG-modified lipid, a sterol and a structural lipid. In some embodiments, the LNP has a molar ratio of about 20-60% ionizable lipid:about 5-25% structural lipid: about 25-55% sterol; and about 0.5-15% PEG-modified lipid.

In some embodiments, the LNP has a polydispersity value of less than 0.4. In some embodiments, the LNP has a net neutral charge at a neutral pH. In some embodiments, the LNP has a mean diameter of 50-150 nm. In some embodiments, the LNP has a mean diameter of 80-100 nm.

As generally defined herein, the term “lipid” refers to a small molecule that has hydrophobic or amphiphilic properties. Lipids may be naturally occurring or synthetic. Examples of classes of lipids include, but are not limited to, fats, waxes, sterol-containing metabolites, vitamins, fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides, and prenol lipids. In some instances, the amphiphilic properties of some lipids lead them to form liposomes, vesicles, or membranes in aqueous media.

In some embodiments, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) may comprise an ionizable lipid. As used herein, the term “ionizable lipid” has its ordinary meaning in the art and may refer to a lipid comprising one or more charged moieties. In some embodiments, an ionizable lipid may be positively charged or negatively charged. An ionizable lipid may be positively charged, in which case it can be referred to as “cationic lipid”. In certain embodiments, an ionizable lipid molecule may comprise an amine group, and can be referred to as an ionizable amino lipid. As used herein, a “charged moiety” is a chemical moiety that carries a formal electronic charge, e.g., monovalent (+1, or −1), divalent (+2, or −2), trivalent (+3, or −3), etc. The charged moiety may be anionic (i.e., negatively charged) or cationic (i.e., positively charged). Examples of positively-charged moieties include amine groups (e.g., primary, secondary, and/or tertiary amines), ammonium groups, pyridinium group, guanidine groups, and imidizolium groups. In a particular embodiment, the charged moieties comprise amine groups. Examples of negatively-charged groups or precursors thereof, include carboxylate groups, sulfonate groups, sulfate groups, phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, hydroxyl groups, and the like. The charge of the charged moiety may vary, in some cases, with the environmental conditions, for example, changes in pH may alter the charge of the moiety, and/or cause the moiety to become charged or uncharged. In general, the charge density of the molecule may be selected as desired.

It should be understood that the terms “charged” or “charged moiety” does not refer to a “partial negative charge” or “partial positive charge” on a molecule. The terms “partial negative charge” and “partial positive charge” are given its ordinary meaning in the art. A “partial negative charge” may result when a functional group comprises a bond that becomes polarized such that electron density is pulled toward one atom of the bond, creating a partial negative charge on the atom. Those of ordinary skill in the art will, in general, recognize bonds that can become polarized in this way.

In some embodiments, the ionizable lipid is an ionizable amino lipid, sometimes referred to in the art as an “ionizable cationic lipid”. In one embodiment, the ionizable amino lipid may have a positively charged hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail that are connected via a linker structure.

In addition to these, an ionizable lipid may also be a lipid including a cyclic amine group.

In one embodiment, the ionizable lipid may be selected from, but not limited to, a ionizable lipid described in International Publication Nos. WO2013086354 and WO2013116126; the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In yet another embodiment, the ionizable lipid may be selected from, but not limited to, formula CLI-CLXXXXII of U.S. Pat. No. 7,404,969; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment, the lipid may be a cleavable lipid such as those described in International Publication No. WO2012170889, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the lipid may be synthesized by methods known in the art and/or as described in International Publication Nos. WO2013086354; the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Nanoparticle compositions can be characterized by a variety of methods. For example, microscopy (e.g., transmission electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy) can be used to examine the morphology and size distribution of a nanoparticle composition. Dynamic light scattering or potentiometry (e.g., potentiometric titrations) can be used to measure zeta potentials. Dynamic light scattering can also be utilized to determine particle sizes. Instruments such as the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) can also be used to measure multiple characteristics of a nanoparticle composition, such as particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential.

The size of the nanoparticles can help counter biological reactions such as, but not limited to, inflammation, or can increase the biological effect of the polynucleotide.

As used herein, “size” or “mean size” in the context of nanoparticle compositions refers to the mean diameter of a nanoparticle composition.

In one embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding a G6PC polypeptide are formulated in lipid nanoparticles having a diameter from about 10 to about 100 nm such as, but not limited to, about 10 to about 20 nm, about 10 to about 30 nm, about 10 to about 40 nm, about 10 to about 50 nm, about 10 to about 60 nm, about 10 to about 70 nm, about 10 to about 80 nm, about 10 to about 90 nm, about 20 to about 30 nm, about 20 to about 40 nm, about 20 to about 50 nm, about 20 to about 60 nm, about 20 to about 70 nm, about 20 to about 80 nm, about 20 to about 90 nm, about 20 to about 100 nm, about 30 to about 40 nm, about 30 to about 50 nm, about 30 to about 60 nm, about 30 to about 70 nm, about 30 to about 80 nm, about 30 to about 90 nm, about 30 to about 100 nm, about 40 to about 50 nm, about 40 to about 60 nm, about 40 to about 70 nm, about 40 to about 80 nm, about 40 to about 90 nm, about 40 to about 100 nm, about 50 to about 60 nm, about 50 to about 70 nm, about 50 to about 80 nm, about 50 to about 90 nm, about 50 to about 100 nm, about 60 to about 70 nm, about 60 to about 80 nm, about 60 to about 90 nm, about 60 to about 100 nm, about 70 to about 80 nm, about 70 to about 90 nm, about 70 to about 100 nm, about 80 to about 90 nm, about 80 to about 100 nm and/or about 90 to about 100 nm.

In one embodiment, the nanoparticles have a diameter from about 10 to 500 nm. In one embodiment, the nanoparticle has a diameter greater than 100 nm, greater than 150 nm, greater than 200 nm, greater than 250 nm, greater than 300 nm, greater than 350 nm, greater than 400 nm, greater than 450 nm, greater than 500 nm, greater than 550 nm, greater than 600 nm, greater than 650 nm, greater than 700 nm, greater than 750 nm, greater than 800 nm, greater than 850 nm, greater than 900 nm, greater than 950 nm or greater than 1000 nm.

In some embodiments, the largest dimension of a nanoparticle composition is 1 μm or shorter (e.g., 1 μm, 900 nm, 800 nm, 700 nm, 600 nm, 500 nm, 400 nm, 300 nm, 200 nm, 175 nm, 150 nm, 125 nm, 100 nm, 75 nm, 50 nm, or shorter).

A nanoparticle composition can be relatively homogenous. A polydispersity index can be used to indicate the homogeneity of a nanoparticle composition, e.g., the particle size distribution of the nanoparticle composition. A small (e.g., less than 0.3) polydispersity index generally indicates a narrow particle size distribution. A nanoparticle composition can have a polydispersity index from about 0 to about 0.25, such as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, or 0.25. In some embodiments, the polydispersity index of a nanoparticle composition disclosed herein can be from about 0.10 to about 0.20.

The zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition can be used to indicate the electrokinetic potential of the composition. For example, the zeta potential can describe the surface charge of a nanoparticle composition. Nanoparticle compositions with relatively low charges, positive or negative, are generally desirable, as more highly charged species can interact undesirably with cells, tissues, and other elements in the body. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition disclosed herein can be from about −10 mV to about +20 mV, from about −10 mV to about +15 mV, from about 10 mV to about +10 mV, from about −10 mV to about +5 mV, from about −10 mV to about 0 mV, from about −10 mV to about −5 mV, from about −5 mV to about +20 mV, from about −5 mV to about +15 mV, from about −5 mV to about +10 mV, from about −5 mV to about +5 mV, from about −5 mV to about 0 mV, from about 0 mV to about +20 mV, from about 0 mV to about +15 mV, from about 0 mV to about +10 mV, from about 0 mV to about +5 mV, from about +5 mV to about +20 mV, from about +5 mV to about +15 mV, or from about +5 mV to about +10 mV.

In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the lipid nanoparticles can be from about 0 mV to about 100 mV, from about 0 mV to about 90 mV, from about 0 mV to about 80 mV, from about 0 mV to about 70 mV, from about 0 mV to about 60 mV, from about 0 mV to about 50 mV, from about 0 mV to about 40 mV, from about 0 mV to about 30 mV, from about 0 mV to about 20 mV, from about 0 mV to about 10 mV, from about 10 mV to about 100 mV, from about 10 mV to about 90 mV, from about 10 mV to about 80 mV, from about 10 mV to about 70 mV, from about 10 mV to about 60 mV, from about 10 mV to about 50 mV, from about 10 mV to about 40 mV, from about 10 mV to about 30 mV, from about 10 mV to about 20 mV, from about 20 mV to about 100 mV, from about 20 mV to about 90 mV, from about 20 mV to about 80 mV, from about 20 mV to about 70 mV, from about 20 mV to about 60 mV, from about 20 mV to about 50 mV, from about 20 mV to about 40 mV, from about 20 mV to about 30 mV, from about 30 mV to about 100 mV, from about 30 mV to about 90 mV, from about 30 mV to about 80 mV, from about 30 mV to about 70 mV, from about 30 mV to about 60 mV, from about 30 mV to about 50 mV, from about 30 mV to about 40 mV, from about 40 mV to about 100 mV, from about 40 mV to about 90 mV, from about 40 mV to about 80 mV, from about 40 mV to about 70 mV, from about 40 mV to about 60 mV, and from about 40 mV to about 50 mV. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the lipid nanoparticles can be from about 10 mV to about 50 mV, from about 15 mV to about 45 mV, from about 20 mV to about 40 mV, and from about 25 mV to about 35 mV. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the lipid nanoparticles can be about 10 mV, about 20 mV, about 30 mV, about 40 mV, about 50 mV, about 60 mV, about 70 mV, about 80 mV, about 90 mV, and about 100 mV.

The term “encapsulation efficiency” of a polynucleotide describes the amount of the polynucleotide that is encapsulated by or otherwise associated with a nanoparticle composition after preparation, relative to the initial amount provided. As used herein, “encapsulation” can refer to complete, substantial, or partial enclosure, confinement, surrounding, or encasement.

Encapsulation efficiency is desirably high (e.g., close to 100%). The encapsulation efficiency can be measured, for example, by comparing the amount of the polynucleotide in a solution containing the nanoparticle composition before and after breaking up the nanoparticle composition with one or more organic solvents or detergents.

Fluorescence can be used to measure the amount of free polynucleotide in a solution. For the nanoparticle compositions described herein, the encapsulation efficiency of a polynucleotide can be at least 50%, for example 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. In some embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency can be at least 80%. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency can be at least 90%.

The amount of a polynucleotide present in a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein can depend on multiple factors such as the size of the polynucleotide, desired target and/or application, or other properties of the nanoparticle composition as well as on the properties of the polynucleotide.

For example, the amount of an mRNA useful in a nanoparticle composition can depend on the size (expressed as length, or molecular mass), sequence, and other characteristics of the mRNA. The relative amounts of a polynucleotide in a nanoparticle composition can also vary.

The relative amounts of the lipid composition and the polynucleotide present in a lipid nanoparticle composition of the present disclosure can be optimized according to considerations of efficacy and tolerability. For compositions including an mRNA as a polynucleotide, the N:P ratio can serve as a useful metric.

As the N:P ratio of a nanoparticle composition controls both expression and tolerability, nanoparticle compositions with low N:P ratios and strong expression are desirable. N:P ratios vary according to the ratio of lipids to RNA in a nanoparticle composition.

In general, a lower N:P ratio is preferred. The one or more RNA, lipids, and amounts thereof can be selected to provide an N:P ratio from about 2:1 to about 30:1, such as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 12:1, 14:1, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1, 28:1, or 30:1. In certain embodiments, the N:P ratio can be from about 2:1 to about 8:1. In other embodiments, the N:P ratio is from about 5:1 to about 8:1. In certain embodiments, the N:P ratio is between 5:1 and 6:1. In one specific aspect, the N:P ratio is about is about 5.67:1.

In addition to providing nanoparticle compositions, the present disclosure also provides methods of producing lipid nanoparticles comprising encapsulating a polynucleotide. Such method comprises using any of the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein and producing lipid nanoparticles in accordance with methods of production of lipid nanoparticles known in the art. See, e.g., Wang et al. (2015) “Delivery of oligonucleotides with lipid nanoparticles” Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 87:68-80; Silva et al. (2015) “Delivery Systems for Biopharmaceuticals.

**21. Other Delivery Agents**

a. Liposomes, Lipoplexes, and Lipid Nanoparticles

In some embodiments, the compositions or formulations of the present disclosure comprise a delivery agent, e.g., a liposome, a lipolexes, a lipid nanoparticle, or any combination thereof. The polynucleotides described herein (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide) can be formulated using one or more liposomes, lipoplexes, or lipid nanoparticles. Liposomes, lipoplexes, or lipid nanoparticles can be used to improve the efficacy of the polynucleotides directed protein production as these formulations can increase cell transfection by the polynucleotide; and/or increase the translation of encoded protein. The liposomes, lipoplexes, or lipid nanoparticles can also be used to increase the stability of the polynucleotides.

Liposomes are artificially-prepared vesicles that can primarily be composed of a lipid bilayer and can be used as a delivery vehicle for the administration of pharmaceutical formulations. Liposomes can be of different sizes. A multilamellar vesicle (MLV) can be hundreds of nanometers in diameter, and can contain a series of concentric bilayers separated by narrow aqueous compartments. A small unicellular vesicle (SUV) can be smaller than 50 nm in diameter, and a large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) can be between 50 and 500 nm in diameter. Liposome design can include, but is not limited to, opsonins or ligands to improve the attachment of liposomes to unhealthy tissue or to activate events such as, but not limited to, endocytosis. Liposomes can contain a low or a high pH value to improve the delivery of the pharmaceutical formulations.

**22. Accelerated Blood Clearance**

The disclosure provides compounds, compositions and methods of use thereof for reducing the effect of ABC on a repeatedly administered active agent such as a biologically active agent. As will be readily apparent, reducing or eliminating altogether the effect of ABC on an administered active agent effectively increases its half-life and thus its efficacy.

ABC inducing LNPs cause a reduction in circulating levels of an active agent upon a second or subsequent administration within a given time frame. Thus, a reduction in ABC refers to less clearance of circulating agent upon a second or subsequent dose of agent, relative to a standard LNP. The reduction may be, for instance, at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 100%. In some embodiments the reduction is 10-100%, 10-50%, 20-100%, 20-50%, 30-100%, 30-50%, 40%-100%, 40-80%, 50-90%, or 50-100%. Alternatively, the reduction in ABC may be characterized as at least a detectable level of circulating agent following a second or subsequent administration or at least a 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold increase in circulating agent relative to circulating agent following administration of a standard LNP. In some embodiments the reduction is a 2-100 fold, 2-50 fold, 3-100 fold, 3-50 fold, 3-20 fold, 4-100 fold, 4-50 fold, 4-40 fold, 4-30 fold, 4-25 fold, 4-20 fold, 4-15 fold, 4-10 fold, 4-5 fold, 5-100 fold, 5-50 fold, 5-40 fold, 5-30 fold, 5-25 fold, 5-20 fold, 5-15 fold, 5-10 fold, 6-100 fold, 6-50 fold, 6-40 fold, 6-30 fold, 6-25 fold, 6-20 fold, 6-15 fold, 6-10 fold, 8-100 fold, 8-50 fold, 8-40 fold, 8-30 fold, 8-25 fold, 8-20 fold, 8-15 fold, 8-10 fold, 10-100 fold, 10-50 fold, 10-40 fold, 10-30 fold, 10-25 fold, 10-20 fold, 10-15 fold, 20-100 fold, 20-50 fold, 20-40 fold, 20-30 fold, or 20-25 fold.

The disclosure provides lipid-comprising compounds and compositions that are less susceptible to clearance and thus have a longer half-life in vivo. This is particularly the case where the compositions are intended for repeated including chronic administration, and even more particularly where such repeated administration occurs within days or weeks.

Significantly, these compositions are less susceptible or altogether circumvent the observed phenomenon of accelerated blood clearance (ABC). ABC is a phenomenon in which certain exogenously administered agents are rapidly cleared from the blood upon second and subsequent administrations. This phenomenon has been observed, in part, for a variety of lipid-containing compositions including but not limited to lipidated agents, liposomes or other lipid-based delivery vehicles, and lipid-encapsulated agents. Heretofore, the basis of ABC has been poorly understood and in some cases attributed to a humoral immune response and accordingly strategies for limiting its impact in vivo particularly in a clinical setting have remained elusive.

This disclosure provides compounds and compositions that are less susceptible, if at all susceptible, to ABC. In some important aspects, such compounds and compositions are lipid-comprising compounds or compositions. The lipid-containing compounds or compositions of this disclosure, surprisingly, do not experience ABC upon second and subsequent administration in vivo. This resistance to ABC renders these compounds and compositions particularly suitable for repeated use in vivo, including for repeated use within short periods of time, including days or 1-2 weeks. This enhanced stability and/or half-life is due, in part, to the inability of these compositions to activate B1a and/or B1b cells and/or conventional B cells, pDCs and/or platelets.

This disclosure therefore provides an elucidation of the mechanism underlying accelerated blood clearance (ABC). It has been found, in accordance with this disclosure and the inventions provided herein, that the ABC phenomenon at least as it relates to lipids and lipid nanoparticles is mediated, at least in part an innate immune response involving B1a and/or B1b cells, pDC and/or platelets. B1a cells are normally responsible for secreting natural antibody, in the form of circulating IgM. This IgM is poly-reactive, meaning that it can bind to a variety of antigens, albeit with a relatively low affinity for each.

It has been found in accordance with the invention that some lipidated agents or lipid-comprising formulations such as lipid nanoparticles administered in vivo trigger and are subject to ABC. It has now been found in accordance with the invention that upon administration of a first dose of the LNP, one or more cells involved in generating an innate immune response (referred to herein as sensors) bind such agent, are activated, and then initiate a cascade of immune factors (referred to herein as effectors) that promote ABC and toxicity. For instance, B1a and B1b cells may bind to LNP, become activated (alone or in the presence of other sensors such as pDC and/or effectors such as IL6) and secrete natural IgM that binds to the LNP. Pre-existing natural IgM in the subject may also recognize and bind to the LNP, thereby triggering complement fixation. After administration of the first dose, the production of natural IgM begins within 1-2 hours of administration of the LNP. Typically, by about 2-3 weeks the natural IgM is cleared from the system due to the natural half-life of IgM. Natural IgG is produced beginning around 96 hours after administration of the LNP. The agent, when administered in a naïve setting, can exert its biological effects relatively unencumbered by the natural IgM produced post-activation of the B1a cells or B1b cells or natural IgG. The natural IgM and natural IgG are non-specific and thus are distinct from anti-PEG IgM and anti-PEG IgG.

Although Applicant is not bound by mechanism, it is proposed that LNPs trigger ABC and/or toxicity through the following mechanisms. It is believed that when an LNP is administered to a subject the LNP is rapidly transported through the blood to the spleen. The LNPs may encounter immune cells in the blood and/or the spleen. A rapid innate immune response is triggered in response to the presence of the LNP within the blood and/or spleen. Applicant has shown herein that within hours of administration of an LNP several immune sensors have reacted to the presence of the LNP. These sensors include but are not limited to immune cells involved in generating an immune response, such as B cells, pDC, and platelets. The sensors may be present in the spleen, such as in the marginal zone of the spleen and/or in the blood. The LNP may physically interact with one or more sensors, which may interact with other sensors. In such a case the LNP is directly or indirectly interacting with the sensors. The sensors may interact directly with one another in response to recognition of the LNP. For instance, many sensors are located in the spleen and can easily interact with one another. Alternatively, one or more of the sensors may interact with LNP in the blood and become activated. The activated sensor may then interact directly with other sensors or indirectly (e.g., through the stimulation or production of a messenger such as a cytokine e.g., IL6).

In some embodiments the LNP may interact directly with and activate each of the following sensors: pDC, B1a cells, B1b cells, and platelets. These cells may then interact directly or indirectly with one another to initiate the production of effectors which ultimately lead to the ABC and/or toxicity associated with repeated doses of LNP. For instance, Applicant has shown that LNP administration leads to pDC activation, platelet aggregation and activation and B cell activation. In response to LNP platelets also aggregate and are activated and aggregate with B cells. pDC cells are activated. LNP has been found to interact with the surface of platelets and B cells relatively quickly. Blocking the activation of any one or combination of these sensors in response to LNP is useful for dampening the immune response that would ordinarily occur. This dampening of the immune response results in the avoidance of ABC and/or toxicity.

The sensors once activated produce effectors. An effector, as used herein, is an immune molecule produced by an immune cell, such as a B cell. Effectors include but are not limited to immunoglobulin such as natural IgM and natural IgG and cytokines such as IL6. B1a and B1b cells stimulate the production of natural IgMs within 2-6 hours following administration of an LNP. Natural IgG can be detected within 96 hours. IL6 levels are increased within several hours. The natural IgM and IgG circulate in the body for several days to several weeks. During this time the circulating effectors can interact with newly administered LNPs, triggering those LNPs for clearance by the body. For instance, an effector may recognize and bind to an LNP. The Fc region of the effector may be recognized by and trigger uptake of the decorated LNP by macrophage. The macrophage is then transported to the spleen. The production of effectors by immune sensors is a transient response that correlates with the timing observed for ABC.

If the administered dose is the second or subsequent administered dose, and if such second or subsequent dose is administered before the previously induced natural IgM and/or IgG is cleared from the system (e.g., before the 2-3 window time period), then such second or subsequent dose is targeted by the circulating natural IgM and/or natural IgG or Fc which trigger alternative complement pathway activation and is itself rapidly cleared. When LNP are administered after the effectors have cleared from the body or are reduced in number, ABC is not observed.

Thus, it is useful according to aspects of the invention to inhibit the interaction between LNP and one or more sensors, to inhibit the activation of one or more sensors by LNP (direct or indirect), to inhibit the production of one or more effectors, and/or to inhibit the activity of one or more effectors. In some embodiments the LNP is designed to limit or block interaction of the LNP with a sensor. For instance, the LNP may have an altered PC and/or PEG to prevent interactions with sensors. Alternatively or additionally, an agent that inhibits immune responses induced by LNPs may be used to achieve any one or more of these effects.

It has also been determined that conventional B cells are also implicated in ABC. Specifically, upon first administration of an agent, conventional B cells, referred to herein as CD19(+), bind to and react against the agent. Unlike B1a and B1b cells though, conventional B cells can mount first an IgM response (beginning around 96 hours after administration of the LNPs) followed by an IgG response (beginning around 14 days after administration of the LNPs) concomitant with a memory response. Thus, conventional B cells react against the administered agent and contribute to IgM (and eventually IgG) that mediates ABC. The IgM and IgG are typically anti-PEG IgM and anti-PEG IgG.

It is contemplated that in some instances, much of the ABC response is mediated through B1a cells and B1a-mediated immune responses. It is further contemplated that in some instances, the ABC response is mediated by both IgM and IgG, with both conventional B cells and B1a cells mediating such effects. In yet still other instances, the ABC response is mediated by natural IgM molecules, some of which are capable of binding to natural IgM, which may be produced by activated B1a cells. The natural IgMs may bind to one or more components of the LNPs, e.g., binding to a phospholipid component of the LNPs (such as binding to the PC moiety of the phospholipid) and/or binding to a PEG-lipid component of the LNPs (such as binding to PEG-DMG, in particular, binding to the PEG moiety of PEG-DMG). Since B1a expresses CD36, to which phosphatidylcholine is a ligand, it is contemplated that the CD36 receptor may mediate the activation of B1a cells and thus production of natural IgM. In yet still other instances, the ABC response is mediated primarily by conventional B cells.

It has been found in accordance with the invention that the ABC phenomenon can be reduced or abrogated, at least in part, through the use of compounds and compositions (such as agents, delivery vehicles, and formulations) that do not activate B1a cells. Compounds and compositions that do not activate B1a cells may be referred to herein as B1a inert compounds and compositions. It has been further found in accordance with the invention that the ABC phenomenon can be reduced or abrogated, at least in part, through the use of compounds and compositions that do not activate conventional B cells. Compounds and compositions that do not activate conventional B cells may in some embodiments be referred to herein as CD19-inert compounds and compositions. Thus, in some embodiments provided herein, the compounds and compositions do not activate B1a cells and they do not activate conventional B cells. Compounds and compositions that do not activate B1a cells and conventional B cells may in some embodiments be referred to herein as B1a/CD19-inert compounds and compositions.

These underlying mechanisms were not heretofore understood, and the role of B1a and B1b cells and their interplay with conventional B cells in this phenomenon was also not appreciated.

Accordingly, this disclosure provides compounds and compositions that do not promote ABC. These may be further characterized as not capable of activating B1a and/or B1b cells, platelets and/or pDC, and optionally conventional B cells also. These compounds (e.g., agents, including biologically active agents such as prophylactic agents, therapeutic agents and diagnostic agents, delivery vehicles, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and other lipid-based encapsulating structures, etc.) and compositions (e.g., formulations, etc.) are particularly desirable for applications requiring repeated administration, and in particular repeated administrations that occur within with short periods of time (e.g., within 1-2 weeks). This is the case, for example, if the agent is a nucleic acid based therapeutic that is provided to a subject at regular, closely-spaced intervals. The findings provided herein may be applied to these and other agents that are similarly administered and/or that are subject to ABC.

Of particular interest are lipid-comprising compounds, lipid-comprising particles, and lipid-comprising compositions as these are known to be susceptible to ABC. Such lipid-comprising compounds particles, and compositions have been used extensively as biologically active agents or as delivery vehicles for such agents. Thus, the ability to improve their efficacy of such agents, whether by reducing the effect of ABC on the agent itself or on its delivery vehicle, is beneficial for a wide variety of active agents.

Also provided herein are compositions that do not stimulate or boost an acute phase response (ARP) associated with repeat dose administration of one or more biologically active agents.

The composition, in some instances, may not bind to IgM, including but not limited to natural IgM.

The composition, in some instances, may not bind to an acute phase protein such as but not limited to C-reactive protein.

The composition, in some instances, may not trigger a CD5(+) mediated immune response. As used herein, a CD5(+) mediated immune response is an immune response that is mediated by B1a and/or B1b cells. Such a response may include an ABC response, an acute phase response, induction of natural IgM and/or IgG, and the like.

The composition, in some instances, may not trigger a CD19(+) mediated immune response. As used herein, a CD19(+) mediated immune response is an immune response that is mediated by conventional CD19(+), CD5(−) B cells. Such a response may include induction of IgM, induction of IgG, induction of memory B cells, an ABC response, an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response including an anti-protein response where the protein may be encapsulated within an LNP, and the like.

B1a cells are a subset of B cells involved in innate immunity. These cells are the source of circulating IgM, referred to as natural antibody or natural serum antibody. Natural IgM antibodies are characterized as having weak affinity for several antigens, and therefore they are referred to as “poly-specific” or “poly-reactive”, indicating their ability to bind to more than one antigen. B1a cells are not able to produce IgG. Additionally, they do not develop into memory cells and thus do not contribute to an adaptive immune response. However, they can secrete IgM upon activation. The secreted IgM is typically cleared within about 2-3 weeks, at which point the immune system is rendered relatively naïve to the previously administered antigen. If the same antigen is presented after this time period (e.g., at about 3 weeks after the initial exposure), the antigen is not rapidly cleared. However, significantly, if the antigen is presented within that time period (e.g., within 2 weeks, including within 1 week, or within days), then the antigen is rapidly cleared. This delay between consecutive doses has rendered certain lipid-containing therapeutic or diagnostic agents unsuitable for use.

In humans, B1a cells are CD19(+), CD20(+), CD27(+), CD43(+), CD70(−) and CD5(+). In mice, B1a cells are CD19(+), CD5(+), and CD45 B cell isoform B220(+). It is the expression of CD5 which typically distinguishes B1a cells from other convention B cells. B1a cells may express high levels of CD5, and on this basis, may be distinguished from other B-1 cells such as B-1b cells which express low or undetectable levels of CD5. CD5 is a pan-T cell surface glycoprotein. B1a cells also express CD36, also known as fatty acid translocase. CD36 is a member of the class B scavenger receptor family. CD36 can bind many ligands, including oxidized low-density lipoproteins, native lipoproteins, oxidized phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids.

B1b cells are another subset of B cells involved in innate immunity. These cells are another source of circulating natural IgM. Several antigens, including PS, are capable of inducing T cell independent immunity through B1b activation. CD27 is typically upregulated on B1b cells in response to antigen activation. Similar to B1a cells, the B1b cells are typically located in specific body locations such as the spleen and peritoneal cavity and are in very low abundance in the blood. The B1b secreted natural IgM is typically cleared within about 2-3 weeks, at which point the immune system is rendered relatively naïve to the previously administered antigen. If the same antigen is presented after this time period (e.g., at about 3 weeks after the initial exposure), the antigen is not rapidly cleared. However, significantly, if the antigen is presented within that time period (e.g., within 2 weeks, including within 1 week, or within days), then the antigen is rapidly cleared. This delay between consecutive doses has rendered certain lipid-containing therapeutic or diagnostic agents unsuitable for use.

In some embodiments it is desirable to block B1a and/or B1b cell activation. One strategy for blocking B1a and/or B1b cell activation involves determining which components of a lipid nanoparticle promote B cell activation and neutralizing those components. It has been discovered herein that at least PEG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) contribute to B1a and B1b cell interaction with other cells and/or activation. PEG may play a role in promoting aggregation between B1 cells and platelets, which may lead to activation. PC (a helper lipid in LNPs) is also involved in activating the B1 cells, likely through interaction with the CD36 receptor on the B cell surface. Numerous particles have PEG-lipid alternatives, PEG-less, and/or PC replacement lipids (e.g. oleic acid or analogs thereof) have been designed and tested. Applicant has established that replacement of one or more of these components within an LNP that otherwise would promote ABC upon repeat administration, is useful in preventing ABC by reducing the production of natural IgM and/or B cell activation. Thus, the invention encompasses LNPs that have reduced ABC as a result of a design which eliminates the inclusion of B cell triggers.

Another strategy for blocking B1a and/or B1b cell activation involves using an agent that inhibits immune responses induced by LNPs. These types of agents are discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments these agents block the interaction between B1a/B1b cells and the LNP or platelets or pDC. For instance, the agent may be an antibody or other binding agent that physically blocks the interaction. An example of this is an antibody that binds to CD36 or CD6. The agent may also be a compound that prevents or disables the B1a/B1b cell from signaling once activated or prior to activation. For instance, it is possible to block one or more components in the B1a/B1b signaling cascade the results from B cell interaction with LNP or other immune cells. In other embodiments the agent may act one or more effectors produced by the B1a/B1b cells following activation. These effectors include for instance, natural IgM and cytokines.

It has been demonstrated according to aspects of the invention that when activation of pDC cells is blocked, B cell activation in response to LNP is decreased. Thus, to avoid ABC and/or toxicity, it may be desirable to prevent pDC activation. Similar to the strategies discussed above, pDC cell activation may be blocked by agents that interfere with the interaction between pDC and LNP and/or B cells/platelets. Alternatively, agents that act on the pDC to block its ability to get activated or on its effectors can be used together with the LNP to avoid ABC.

Platelets may also play an important role in ABC and toxicity. Very quickly after a first dose of LNP is administered to a subject, platelets associate with the LNP, aggregate and are activated. In some embodiments it is desirable to block platelet aggregation and/or activation. One strategy for blocking platelet aggregation and/or activation involves determining which components of a lipid nanoparticle promote platelet aggregation and/or activation and neutralizing those components. It has been discovered herein that at least PEG contribute to platelet aggregation, activation and/or interaction with other cells. Numerous particles have PEG-lipid alternatives and PEG-less have been designed and tested. Applicant has established that replacement of one or more of these components within an LNP that otherwise would promote ABC upon repeat administration, is useful in preventing ABC by reducing the production of natural IgM and/or platelet aggregation. Thus, the invention encompasses LNPs that have reduced ABC as a result of a design which eliminates the inclusion of platelet triggers. Alternatively, agents that act on the platelets to block its activity once it is activated or on its effectors can be used together with the LNP to avoid ABC.

(i) Measuring ABC Activity and Related Activities

Various compounds and compositions provided herein, including LNPs, do not promote ABC activity upon administration in vivo. These LNPs may be characterized and/or identified through any of several assays, such as but not limited to those described below, as well as any of the assays disclosed in the Examples section, include the methods subsection of the Examples.

In some embodiments the methods involve administering an LNP without producing an immune response that promotes ABC. An immune response that promotes ABC involves activation of one or more sensors, such as B1 cells, pDC, or platelets, and one or more effectors, such as natural IgM, natural IgG or cytokines such as IL6. Thus administration of an LNP without producing an immune response that promotes ABC, at a minimum involves administration of an LNP without significant activation of one or more sensors and significant production of one or more effectors. Significant used in this context refers to an amount that would lead to the physiological consequence of accelerated blood clearance of all or part of a second dose with respect to the level of blood clearance expected for a second dose of an ABC triggering LNP. For instance, the immune response should be dampened such that the ABC observed after the second dose is lower than would have been expected for an ABC triggering LNP.

(ii) B1a or B1b Activation Assay

Certain compositions provided in this disclosure do not activate B cells, such as B1a or B1b cells (CD19+CD5+) and/or conventional B cells (CD19+CD5−). Activation of B1a cells, B1b cells, or conventional B cells may be determined in several ways, some of which are provided below. B cell population may be provided as fractionated B cell populations or unfractionated populations of splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). If the latter, the cell population may be incubated with the LNP of choice for a period of time, and then harvested for further analysis. Alternatively, the supernatant may be harvested and analyzed.

(iii) Upregulation of Activation Marker Cell Surface Expression

Activation of B1a cells, B1b cells, or conventional B cells may be demonstrated as increased expression of B cell activation markers including late activation markers such as CD86. In an exemplary non-limiting assay, unfractionated B cells are provided as a splenocyte population or as a PBMC population, incubated with an LNP of choice for a particular period of time, and then stained for a standard B cell marker such as CD19 and for an activation marker such as CD86, and analyzed using for example flow cytometry. A suitable negative control involves incubating the same population with medium, and then performing the same staining and visualization steps. An increase in CD86 expression in the test population compared to the negative control indicates B cell activation.

(iv) Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Release

B cell activation may also be assessed by cytokine release assay. For example, activation may be assessed through the production and/or secretion of cytokines such as IL-6 and/or TNF-alpha upon exposure with LNPs of interest.

Such assays may be performed using routine cytokine secretion assays well known in the art. An increase in cytokine secretion is indicative of B cell activation.

(v) LNP Binding/Association to and/or Uptake by B Cells

LNP association or binding to B cells may also be used to assess an LNP of interest and to further characterize such LNP. Association/binding and/or uptake/internalization may be assessed using a detectably labeled, such as fluorescently labeled, LNP and tracking the location of such LNP in or on B cells following various periods of incubation.

The invention further contemplates that the compositions provided herein may be capable of evading recognition or detection and optionally binding by downstream mediators of ABC such as circulating IgM and/or acute phase response mediators such as acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP).

(vi) Methods of Use for Reducing ABC

Also provided herein are methods for delivering LNPs, which may encapsulate an agent such as a therapeutic agent, to a subject without promoting ABC.

In some embodiments, the method comprises administering any of the LNPs described herein, which do not promote ABC, for example, do not induce production of natural IgM binding to the LNPs, do not activate B1a and/or B1b cells. As used herein, an LNP that “does not promote ABC” refers to an LNP that induces no immune responses that would lead to substantial ABC or a substantially low level of immune responses that is not sufficient to lead to substantial ABC. An LNP that does not induce the production of natural IgMs binding to the LNP refers to LNPs that induce either no natural IgM binding to the LNPs or a substantially low level of the natural IgM molecules, which is insufficient to lead to substantial ABC. An LNP that does not activate B1a and/or B1b cells refer to LNPs that induce no response of B1a and/or B1b cells to produce natural IgM binding to the LNPs or a substantially low level of B1a and/or B1b responses, which is insufficient to lead to substantial ABC.

In some embodiments the terms do not activate and do not induce production are a relative reduction to a reference value or condition. In some embodiments the reference value or condition is the amount of activation or induction of production of a molecule such as IgM by a standard LNP such as an MC3 LNP. In some embodiments the relative reduction is a reduction of at least 30%, for example at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. In other embodiments the terms do not activate cells such as B cells and do not induce production of a protein such as IgM may refer to an undetectable amount of the active cells or the specific protein.

(vii) Platelet Effects and Toxicity

The invention is further premised in part on the elucidation of the mechanism underlying dose-limiting toxicity associated with LNP administration. Such toxicity may involve coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, also referred to as consumptive coagulopathy), whether acute or chronic, and/or vascular thrombosis. In some instances, the dose-limiting toxicity associated with LNPs is acute phase response (APR) or complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA).

As used herein, coagulopathy refers to increased coagulation (blood clotting) in vivo. The findings reported in this disclosure are consistent with such increased coagulation and significantly provide insight on the underlying mechanism. Coagulation is a process that involves several different factors and cell types, and heretofore the relationship between and interaction of LNPs and platelets has not been understood in this regard. This disclosure provides evidence of such interaction and provides compounds and compositions that are modified to have reduced platelet effect, including reduced platelet association, reduced platelet aggregation, and/or reduced platelet aggregation. The ability to modulate, including preferably down-modulate, such platelet effects can reduce the incidence and/or severity of coagulopathy post-LNP administration. This in turn will reduce toxicity relating to such LNP, thereby allowing higher doses of LNPs and importantly their cargo to be administered to patients in need thereof.

CARPA is a class of acute immune toxicity manifested in hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), which may be triggered by nanomedicines and biologicals. Unlike allergic reactions, CARPA typically does not involve IgE but arises as a consequence of activation of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune system that enhances the body's abilities to clear pathogens. One or more of the following pathways, the classical complement pathway (CP), the alternative pathway (AP), and the lectin pathway (LP), may be involved in CARPA. Szebeni, Molecular Immunology, 61:163-173 (2014).

The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex, which contains. C1q, C1r, C1s, or C1qr2s2. Activation of the C1-complex occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens, or when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of C1r, which in turn, cleave C1s. The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b then binds the C3 convertase to from the C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex). The alternative pathway is continuously activated as a result of spontaneous C3 hydrolysis. Factor P (properdin) is a positive regulator of the alternative pathway. Oligomerization of properdin stabilizes the C3 convertase, which can then cleave much more C3. The C3 molecules can bind to surfaces and recruit more B, D, and P activity, leading to amplification of the complement activation.

Acute phase response (APR) is a complex, systemic innate immune response for preventing infection and clearing potential pathogens. Numerous proteins are involved in APR and C-reactive protein is a well-characterized one.

It has been found, in accordance with the invention, that certain LNP are able to associate physically with platelets almost immediately after administration in vivo, while other LNP do not associate with platelets at all or only at background levels. Significantly, those LNPs that associate with platelets also apparently stabilize the platelet aggregates that are formed thereafter. Physical contact of the platelets with certain LNPs correlates with the ability of such platelets to remain aggregated or to form aggregates continuously for an extended period of time after administration. Such aggregates comprise activated platelets and innate immune cells such as macrophages and B cells.

The skilled artisan will appreciate that the therapeutic effectiveness of a drug or a treatment of the instant invention can be characterized or determined by measuring the level of expression of an encoded protein (e.g., enzyme) in a sample or in samples taken from a subject (e.g., from a preclinical test subject (rodent, primate, etc.) or from a clinical subject (human). Likewise, the therapeutic effectiveness of a drug or a treatment of the instant invention can be characterized or determined by measuring the level of activity of an encoded protein (e.g., enzyme) in a sample or in samples taken from a subject (e.g., from a preclinical test subject (rodent, primate, etc.) or from a clinical subject (human). Furthermore, the therapeutic effectiveness of a drug or a treatment of the instant invention can be characterized or determined by measuring the level of an appropriate biomarker in sample(s) taken from a subject. Levels of protein and/or biomarkers can be determined post-administration with a single dose of an mRNA therapeutic of the invention or can be determined and/or monitored at several time points following administration with a single dose or can be determined and/or monitored throughout a course of treatment, e.g., a multi-dose treatment.

GSD-Ia is associated with the impaired ability of G6PC to hydrolyze glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate. Accordingly, subjects with GSD-Ia commonly show high levels of glycogen or and/or G6P in their cells and tissues, and low levels of glucose in their blood/plasma.

GSD-Ia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease characterized by an impaired ability to maintain glucose homeostasis. GSD-Ia patients typically present with fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, lactic academia, and/or growth retardation. GSD-Ia patients can be asymptomatic carriers of the disorder or suffer from the various symptoms associated with the disease. Subjects with GSD-Ia commonly show higher levels of glycogen and/or glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) in cells and tissues (e.g., in hepatic cells, in liver, in kidneys, in the intestine) when fasted. Subjects with GSD-Ia also often show higher levels of triglycerides and/or cholesterol in their blood, plasma, or serum, and/or higher levels of lactate, when fasted. Subjects with GSD-Ia also commonly present with lower levels of glucose, e.g., in blood, plasma or serum glucose, when fasted. Unless otherwise specified, the methods of treating GSD-Ia patients or human subjects disclosed herein include treatment of both asymptomatic carriers and those individuals with abnormal levels of biomarkers.

**G6PC Protein Expression Levels**

Certain aspects disclosed herein feature measurement, determination and/or monitoring of the expression level or levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase or G6PC) protein in a subject, for example, in an animal (e.g., rodents, primates, and the like) or in a human subject. Animals include normal, healthy or wildtype animals, as well as animal models for use in understanding GSD-Ia and treatments thereof. Exemplary animal models include rodent models, for example, G6PC deficient mice also referred to as G6PC mice, e.g., global G6pc knockout mice (G6pc(−/−)) or liver-specific knockout mice (L-G6pc(−/−)) (see Lei et al., Nat. Genet., 1996, 13:203-209; Mutel et al., J. Hepatol., 2011, 54:529-537).

G6PC protein expression levels can be measured or determined by any art-recognized method for determining protein levels in biological samples, e.g., from blood or tissue samples or a needle biopsy. The term “level” or “level of a protein” as used herein, preferably means the weight, mass or concentration of the protein within a sample or a subject. It will be understood by the skilled artisan that in certain embodiments the sample may be subjected, e.g., to any of the following: purification, precipitation, separation, e.g. centrifugation and/or HPLC, and subsequently subjected to determining the level of the protein, e.g., using mass and/or spectrometric analysis. In exemplary embodiments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to determine protein expression levels. In other exemplary embodiments, protein purification, separation and LC-MS can be used as a means for determining the level of a protein according to the invention. In some embodiments, an mRNA therapy disclosed herein (e.g., a single intravenous dose) results in increased G6PC protein expression levels in the liver tissue of the subject (e.g., 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold increase and/or increased to at least 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 100% of normal levels) for at least 6 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 24 hours, at least 36 hours, at least 48 hours, at least 60 hours, at least 72 hours, at least 84 hours, at least 96 hours, at least 108 hours, at least 120 hours, at least 132 hours, at least 144 hours, at least 156 hours, at least 168 hours, at least 192 hours, at least 216 hours, at least 240 hours, at least 264 hours, at least 288 hours, at least 312 hours, or at least 336 hours after administration of a single dose of the mRNA therapy.

In subjects with GSD-Ia, G6PC enzymatic activity is reduced compared to a normal physiological activity level. Further aspects disclosed herein feature measurement, determination and/or monitoring of the activity level(s) (i.e., enzymatic activity level(s)) of G6PC protein in a subject, for example, in an animal (e.g., rodent, primate, and the like) or in a human subject. Activity levels can be measured or determined by any art-recognized method for determining enzymatic activity levels in biological samples. The term “activity level” or “enzymatic activity level” as used herein, preferably means the activity of the enzyme per volume, mass or weight of sample or total protein within a sample. In exemplary embodiments, the “activity level” or “enzymatic activity level” is described in terms of units per milliliter of fluid (e.g., bodily fluid, e.g., serum, plasma, urine and the like) or is described in terms of units per weight of tissue or per weight of protein (e.g., total protein) within a sample. Units (“U”) of enzyme activity can be described in terms of weight or mass of substrate hydrolyzed per unit time. In certain embodiments of the invention feature G6PC activity described in terms of U/ml plasma or U/mg protein (tissue), where units (“U”) are described in terms of nmol substrate hydrolyzed per hour (or nmol/hr).

In certain embodiments, an mRNA therapy of the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a dose of mRNA effective to result in at least 5 U/mg, at least 10 U/mg, at least 20 U/mg, at least 30 U/mg, at least 40 U/mg, at least 50 U/mg, at least 60 U/mg, at least 70 U/mg, at least 80 U/mg, at least 90 U/mg, at least 100 U/mg, or at least 150 U/mg of G6PC activity in tissue (e.g., liver) between 2 and 6 hours, between 6 and 12 hours, or between 12 and 24, between 24 and 48, or between 48 and 72 hours post administration (e.g., at 48 or at 72 hours post administration).

In exemplary embodiments, an mRNA therapy described herein features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a single intravenous dose of mRNA that results in the above-described levels of activity. In another embodiment, an mRNA therapy of the invention features a pharmaceutical composition which can be administered in multiple single unit intravenous doses of mRNA that maintain the above-described levels of activity.

**GSD-Ia Biomarkers**

Further aspects of the invention feature determining the level (or levels) of a biomarker determined in a sample as compared to a level (e.g., a reference level) of the same or another biomarker in another sample, e.g., from the same subject, from another subject, from a control and/or from the same or different time points, and/or a physiologic level, and/or an elevated level, and/or a supraphysiologic level, and/or a level of a control. The skilled artisan will be familiar with physiologic levels of biomarkers, for example, levels in normal or wildtype animals, normal or healthy subjects, and the like, in particular, the level or levels characteristic of subjects who are healthy and/or normal functioning. As used herein, the phrase “elevated level” means amounts greater than normally found in a normal or wildtype preclinical animal or in a normal or healthy subject, e.g. a human subject. As used herein, the term “supraphysiologic” means amounts greater than normally found in a normal or wildtype preclinical animal or in a normal or healthy subject, e.g. a human subject, optionally producing a significantly enhanced physiologic response. As used herein, the term “comparing” or “compared to” preferably means the mathematical comparison of the two or more values, e.g., of the levels of the biomarker(s). It will thus be readily apparent to the skilled artisan whether one of the values is higher, lower or identical to another value or group of values if at least two of such values are compared with each other. Comparing or comparison to can be in the context, for example, of comparing to a control value, e.g., as compared to a reference blood, serum, plasma, and/or tissue (e.g., liver) biomarker level, in said subject prior to administration (e.g., in a person suffering from GSD-Ia) or in a normal or healthy subject. Comparing or comparison to can also be in the context, for example, of comparing to a control value, e.g., as compared to a reference blood, serum, plasma and/or tissue (e.g., liver) biomarker level in said subject prior to administration (e.g., in a person suffering from GSD-Ia) or in a normal or healthy subject. As used herein, a “control” is preferably a sample from a subject wherein the GSD-Ia status of said subject is known. In one embodiment, a control is a sample of a healthy patient. In another embodiment, the control is a sample from at least one subject having a known GSD-Ia status, for example, a severe, mild, or healthy GSD-Ia status, e.g. a control patient. In another embodiment, the control is a sample from a subject not being treated for GSD-Ia. In a still further embodiment, the control is a sample from a single subject or a pool of samples from different subjects and/or samples taken from the subject(s) at different time points.

The term “level” or “level of a biomarker” as used herein, preferably means the mass, weight or concentration of a biomarker of the invention within a sample or a subject. It will be understood by the skilled artisan that in certain embodiments the sample may be subjected to, e.g., one or more of the following: substance purification, precipitation, separation, e.g. centrifugation and/or HPLC and subsequently subjected to determining the level of the biomarker, e.g. using mass spectrometric analysis. In certain embodiments, LC-MS can be used as a means for determining the level of a biomarker according to the invention.

The term “determining the level” of a biomarker as used herein can mean methods which include quantifying an amount of at least one substance in a sample from a subject, for example, in a bodily fluid from the subject (e.g., serum, plasma, urine, lymph, etc.) or in a tissue of the subject (e.g., liver, etc.).

The term “reference level” as used herein can refer to levels (e.g., of a biomarker) in a subject prior to administration of an mRNA therapy of the invention (e.g., in a person suffering from GSD-Ia) or in a normal or healthy subject.

As used herein, the term “normal subject” or “healthy subject” refers to a subject not suffering from symptoms associated with GSD-Ia. Moreover, a subject will be considered to be normal (or healthy) if it has no mutation of the functional portions or domains of the G6PC gene and/or no mutation of the G6PC gene resulting in a reduction of or deficiency of the enzyme G6PC or the activity thereof, resulting in symptoms associated with GSD-Ia. Said mutations will be detected if a sample from the subject is subjected to a genetic testing for such G6PC mutations. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a sample from a healthy subject is used as a control sample, or the known or standardized value for the level of biomarker from samples of healthy or normal subjects is used as a control.

Since G6PC hydrolyzes G6P into glucose and phosphate during gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, low levels of glucose and/or phosphate, and high levels of glycogen and/or G6P, during fasting conditions is indicative that a subject has GSD-Ia or should be treated for GSD-Ia. Thus, glucose, phosphate, glycogen, and G6P can be used as biomarkers for GSD-Ia.

In some embodiments, comparing the level of the biomarker in a sample from a subject in need of treatment for GSD-Ia or in a subject being treated for GSD-Ia to a control level of the biomarker comprises comparing the level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) to a baseline or reference level, wherein if a level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) is elevated, increased or higher compared to the baseline or reference level, this is indicative that the subject is suffering from GSD-Ia and/or is in need of treatment; and/or wherein if a level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) is decreased or lower or the same compared to the baseline level this is indicative that the subject is not suffering from, is successfully being treated for GSD-Ia, or is not in need of treatment for GSD-Ia. The stronger the reduction (e.g., at least 1.5-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least-30 fold, at least 40-fold, at least 50-fold reduction and/or at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30% at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 100% reduction) of the level of a biomarker, within a certain time period, e.g., within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 6 hours, within 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 60 hours, or 72 hours, and/or for a certain duration of time, e.g., 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, etc. the more successful is a therapy, such as for example an mRNA therapy of the invention (e.g., a single dose or a multiple regimen). In some embodiments, the biomarker that is elevated, increased or higher compared to the baseline or reference level, and is indicative of GSD-Ia, is glycogen and/or glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In some embodiments, the biomarker that is elevated, increased or higher compared to the baseline or reference level, and is indicative of GSD-Ia, is lactate. In some embodiments, the biomarker that is elevated, increased or higher compared to the baseline or reference level, and is indicative of GSD-Ia, is triglycerides and/or cholesterol, e.g., in blood, plasma, or serum.

Exemplary time periods include 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours post administration, in particular 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours post administration.

A sustained reduction in some substrate levels (e.g., biomarkers, such as glycogen and/or G6P) is particularly indicative of mRNA therapeutic dosing and/or administration regimens successful for treatment of GSD-Ia. Such sustained reduction can be referred to herein as “duration” of effect. In exemplary embodiments, a reduction of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 100% or more of the level of biomarker, in particular, in a bodily fluid (e.g., plasma, serum, urine, e.g., urinary sediment) or in tissue(s) in a subject (e.g., liver), within 12 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more days following administration is indicative of a successful therapeutic approach. In exemplary embodiments, sustained reduction in substrate (e.g., biomarker) levels in one or more samples (e.g., fluids and/or tissues) is preferred. For example, mRNA therapies resulting in sustained reduction in a biomarker, optionally in combination with sustained reduction of said biomarker in at least one tissue, preferably two, three, four, five or more tissues, is indicative of successful treatment.

In other embodiments, comparing the level of the biomarker in a sample from a subject in need of treatment for GSD-Ia or in a subject being treated for GSD-Ia to a control level of the biomarker comprises comparing the level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) to a baseline or reference level, wherein if a level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) is reduced, decreased or lower compared to the baseline or reference level, this is indicative that the subject is suffering from GSD-Ia and/or is in need of treatment; and/or wherein if a level of the biomarker in the sample from the subject (in need of treatment or being treated for GSD-Ia) is increased or higher or the same compared to the baseline level this is indicative that the subject is not suffering from, is successfully being treated for GSD-Ia, or is not in need of treatment for GSD-Ia. The stronger the increase (e.g., at least 1.5-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least-30 fold, at least 40-fold, at least 50-fold increase and/or at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30% at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 100% increase) of the level of a biomarker, within a certain time period, e.g., within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 6 hours, within 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 60 hours, or 72 hours, and/or for a certain duration of time, e.g., 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, etc. the more successful is a therapy, such as for example an mRNA therapy of the invention (e.g., a single dose or a multiple regimen). In some embodiments, the biomarker that is reduced, decreased or lower compared to the baseline or reference level, and is indicative of GSD-Ia, is glucose, e.g., glucose in blood, plasma or serum. In some embodiments, the biomarker that is reduced, decreased or lower compared to the baseline or reference level, and is indicative of GSD-Ia, is phosphate.

An increase of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least 100% or more of the level of biomarker (e.g., glucose), in particular, in bodily fluid (e.g., plasma, serum, urine, e.g., urinary sediment) or in tissue(s) in a subject (e.g., liver), within 12 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more days following administration is indicative of a dose suitable for successful treatment GSD-Ia, wherein increase as used herein, preferably means that the level of biomarker determined at the end of a specified time period (e.g., post-administration, for example, of a single intravenous dose) is compared to the level of the same biomarker determined at the beginning of said time period (e.g., pre-administration of said dose). Exemplary time periods include 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 or 144 hours post administration, in particular 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours post administration.

A sustained increase in some substrate levels (e.g., biomarkers, e.g., glucose) is particularly indicative of mRNA therapeutic dosing and/or administration regimens successful for treatment of GSD-Ia. Such sustained increase can be referred to herein as “duration” of effect. In exemplary embodiments, an increase of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 100% or more of the level of biomarker, in particular, in a bodily fluid (e.g., plasma, serum, urine, e.g., urinary sediment) or in tissue(s) in a subject (e.g., liver), within 12 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more days following administration is indicative of a successful therapeutic approach. In exemplary embodiments, sustained increase in substrate (e.g., biomarker) levels in one or more samples (e.g., fluids and/or tissues) is preferred. For example, mRNA therapies resulting in sustained reduction in a biomarker, optionally in combination with sustained reduction of said biomarker in at least one tissue, preferably two, three, four, five or more tissues, is indicative of successful treatment.

In some embodiments, a single dose of an mRNA therapy described herein is about 0.2 to about 0.8 mpk. about 0.3 to about 0.7 mpk, about 0.4 to about 0.8 mpk, or about 0.5 mpk. In another embodiment, a single dose of an mRNA therapy of the invention is less than 1.5 mpk, less than 1.25 mpk, less than 1 mpk, or less than 0.75 mpk.

In some embodiments, a subject with GSD-Ia, at risk of developing GSD-Ia, or in need of treatment for GSD-Ia, has a larger liver compared to the size of a liver in a normal or healthy subject, i.e., a subject without GSD-Ia. In some embodiments, a larger liver in a subject indicates that the subject has GSD-Ia, is at risk of having GSD-Ia, or should be treated for GSD-Ia. In some embodiments, a subject having a liver that is 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, or 50% larger than the liver in a normal or healthy subject, or to a reference weight for a normal liver, indicates that the subject has GSD-Ia or should be treated for GSD-Ia.

In some embodiments, the biomarker or biomarkers are measured in a sample taken from a subject in need of treatment for GSD-Ia or in a subject being treated for GSD-Ia that has been fasting (e.g., a subject that has not eaten for some time, e.g., for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 or more hours). In some embodiments, the control sample is taken from a healthy or normal subject that has also been fasting, or the reference level of the biomarker or biomarkers are the levels in a healthy or normal subject that was fasting.

The polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide or a functional fragment or variant thereof) can be delivered to a cell naked. As used herein in, “naked” refers to delivering polynucleotides free from agents that promote transfection. The naked polynucleotides can be delivered to the cell using routes of administration known in the art and described herein.

The polynucleotides of the present invention (e.g., a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a G6PC polypeptide or a functional fragment or variant thereof) can be formulated, using the methods described herein. The formulations can contain polynucleotides that can be modified and/or unmodified. The formulations can further include, but are not limited to, cell penetration agents, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a delivery agent, a bioerodible or biocompatible polymer, a solvent, and a sustained-release delivery depot. The formulated polynucleotides can be delivered to the cell using routes of administration known in the art and described herein.

A pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration can comprise at least one inactive ingredient. Any or none of the inactive ingredients used can have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A non-exhaustive list of inactive ingredients for use in pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration includes hydrochloric acid, mannitol, nitrogen, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide.

Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparations can be sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, and/or emulsions in nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluents and/or solvents, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P., and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables. The sterile formulation can also comprise adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents.

Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.

Injectable formulations can be for direct injection into a region of a tissue, organ and/or subject. As a non-limiting example, a tissue, organ and/or subject can be directly injected a formulation by intramyocardial injection into the ischemic region. (See, e.g., Zangi et al. Nature Biotechnology 2013; the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

To prolong the effect of an active ingredient, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the active ingredient from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, can depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.

For example, the Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular Biology, Juo, Pei-Show, 2nd ed., 2002, CRC Press; The Dictionary of Cell and Molecular Biology, 3rd ed., 1999, Academic Press; and the Oxford Dictionary Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Revised, 2000, Oxford University Press, provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this disclosure.

Wherever aspects are described herein with the language “comprising,” otherwise analogous aspects described in terms of “consisting of” and/or “consisting essentially of” are also provided.

Units, prefixes, and symbols are denoted in their Systeme International de Unites (SI) accepted form. Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range. Where a range of values is recited, it is to be understood that each intervening integer value, and each fraction thereof, between the recited upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed, along with each subrange between such values. The upper and lower limits of any range can independently be included in or excluded from the range, and each range where either, neither or both limits are included is also encompassed within the invention. Where a value is explicitly recited, it is to be understood that values which are about the same quantity or amount as the recited value are also within the scope of the invention. Where a combination is disclosed, each subcombination of the elements of that combination is also specifically disclosed and is within the scope of the invention. Conversely, where different elements or groups of elements are individually disclosed, combinations thereof are also disclosed. Where any element of an invention is disclosed as having a plurality of alternatives, examples of that invention in which each alternative is excluded singly or in any combination with the other alternatives are also hereby disclosed; more than one element of an invention can have such exclusions, and all combinations of elements having such exclusions are hereby disclosed.

Nucleotides are referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes. Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5′ to 3′ orientation. Nucleobases are referred to herein by their commonly known one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Accordingly, A represents adenine, C represents cytosine, G represents guanine, T represents thymine, U represents uracil.

Amino acids are referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Unless otherwise indicated, amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation.

About: The term “about” as used in connection with a numerical value throughout the specification and the claims denotes an interval of accuracy, familiar and acceptable to a person skilled in the art, such interval of accuracy is ±10%.

Where ranges are given, endpoints are included. Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated or otherwise evident from the context and understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art, values that are expressed as ranges can assume any specific value or subrange within the stated ranges in different embodiments of the invention, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit of the range, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Administered in combination: As used herein, the term “administered in combination” or “combined administration” means that two or more agents are administered to a subject at the same time or within an interval such that there can be an overlap of an effect of each agent on the patient. In some embodiments, they are administered within about 60, 30, 15, 10, 5, or 1 minute of one another. In some embodiments, the administrations of the agents are spaced sufficiently closely together such that a combinatorial (e.g., a synergistic) effect is achieved.

Amino acid substitution: The term “amino acid substitution” refers to replacing an amino acid residue present in a parent or reference sequence (e.g., a wild type G6PC sequence) with another amino acid residue. An amino acid can be substituted in a parent or reference sequence (e.g., a wild type G6PC polypeptide sequence), for example, via chemical peptide synthesis or through recombinant methods known in the art. Accordingly, a reference to a “substitution at position X” refers to the substitution of an amino acid present at position X with an alternative amino acid residue. In some aspects, substitution patterns can be described according to the schema AnY, wherein A is the single letter code corresponding to the amino acid naturally or originally present at position n, and Y is the substituting amino acid residue. In other aspects, substitution patterns can be described according to the schema An(YZ), wherein A is the single letter code corresponding to the amino acid residue substituting the amino acid naturally or originally present at position X, and Y and Z are alternative substituting amino acid residue.

In the context of the present disclosure, substitutions (even when they referred to as amino acid substitution) are conducted at the nucleic acid level, i.e., substituting an amino acid residue with an alternative amino acid residue is conducted by substituting the codon encoding the first amino acid with a codon encoding the second amino acid.

Animal: As used herein, the term “animal” refers to any member of the animal kingdom. In some embodiments, “animal” refers to humans at any stage of development. In some embodiments, “animal” refers to non-human animals at any stage of development. In certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog, a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, or a pig). In some embodiments, animals include, but are not limited to, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and worms. In some embodiments, the animal is a transgenic animal, genetically-engineered animal, or a clone.

Approximately: As used herein, the term “approximately,” as applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar to a stated reference value. In certain embodiments, the term “approximately” refers to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value).

Associated with: As used herein with respect to a disease, the term “associated with” means that the symptom, measurement, characteristic, or status in question is linked to the diagnosis, development, presence, or progression of that disease. As association can, but need not, be causatively linked to the disease. For example, symptoms, sequelae, or any effects causing a decrease in the quality of life of a patient of GSD-IA are considered associated with GSD-Ia and in some embodiments of the present invention can be treated, ameliorated, or prevented by administering the polynucleotides of the present invention to a subject in need thereof.

When used with respect to two or more moieties, the terms “associated with,” “conjugated,” “linked,” “attached,” and “tethered,” when used with respect to two or more moieties, means that the moieties are physically associated or connected with one another, either directly or via one or more additional moieties that serves as a linking agent, to form a structure that is sufficiently stable so that the moieties remain physically associated under the conditions in which the structure is used, e.g., physiological conditions. An “association” need not be strictly through direct covalent chemical bonding. It can also suggest ionic or hydrogen bonding or a hybridization based connectivity sufficiently stable such that the “associated” entities remain physically associated.

Bifunctional: As used herein, the term “bifunctional” refers to any substance, molecule or moiety that is capable of or maintains at least two functions. The functions can affect the same outcome or a different outcome. The structure that produces the function can be the same or different. For example, bifunctional modified RNAs of the present invention can encode a G6PC peptide (a first function) while those nucleosides that comprise the encoding RNA are, in and of themselves, capable of extending the half-life of the RNA (second function). In this example, delivery of the bifunctional modified RNA to a subject suffering from a protein deficiency would produce not only a peptide or protein molecule that can ameliorate or treat a disease or conditions, but would also maintain a population modified RNA present in the subject for a prolonged period of time. In other aspects, a bifunction modified mRNA can be a chimeric or quimeric molecule comprising, for example, an RNA encoding a G6PC peptide (a first function) and a second protein either fused to first protein or co-expressed with the first protein.

Biocompatible: As used herein, the term “biocompatible” means compatible with living cells, tissues, organs or systems posing little to no risk of injury, toxicity or rejection by the immune system.

Biodegradable: As used herein, the term “biodegradable” means capable of being broken down into innocuous products by the action of living things.

Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase “biologically active” refers to a characteristic of any substance that has activity in a biological system and/or organism. For instance, a substance that, when administered to an organism, has a biological effect on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. In particular embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present invention can be considered biologically active if even a portion of the polynucleotide is biologically active or mimics an activity considered biologically relevant.

Chimera: As used herein, “chimera” is an entity having two or more incongruous or heterogeneous parts or regions. For example, a chimeric molecule can comprise a first part comprising a G6PC polypeptide, and a second part (e.g., genetically fused to the first part) comprising a second therapeutic protein (e.g., a protein with a distinct enzymatic activity, an antigen binding moiety, or a moiety capable of extending the plasma half-life of G6PC, for example, an Fc region of an antibody).

Sequence Optimization: The term “sequence optimization” refers to a process or series of processes by which nucleobases in a reference nucleic acid sequence are replaced with alternative nucleobases, resulting in a nucleic acid sequence with improved properties, e.g., improved protein expression or decreased immunogenicity.

In general, the goal in sequence optimization is to produce a synonymous nucleotide sequence than encodes the same polypeptide sequence encoded by the reference nucleotide sequence. Thus, there are no amino acid substitutions (as a result of codon optimization) in the polypeptide encoded by the codon optimized nucleotide sequence with respect to the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleotide sequence.

Codon substitution: The terms “codon substitution” or “codon replacement” in the context of sequence optimization refer to replacing a codon present in a reference nucleic acid sequence with another codon. A codon can be substituted in a reference nucleic acid sequence, for example, via chemical peptide synthesis or through recombinant methods known in the art. Accordingly, references to a “substitution” or “replacement” at a certain location in a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., an mRNA) or within a certain region or subsequence of a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., an mRNA) refer to the substitution of a codon at such location or region with an alternative codon.

As used herein, the terms “coding region” and “region encoding” and grammatical variants thereof, refer to an Open Reading Frame (ORF) in a polynucleotide that upon expression yields a polypeptide or protein.

Compound: As used herein, the term “compound,” is meant to include all stereoisomers and isotopes of the structure depicted. As used herein, the term “stereoisomer” means any geometric isomer (e.g., cis- and trans-isomer), enantiomer, or diastereomer of a compound. The present disclosure encompasses any and all stereoisomers of the compounds described herein, including stereomerically pure forms (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g., racemates. Enantiomeric and stereomeric mixtures of compounds and means of resolving them into their component enantiomers or stereoisomers are well-known. “Isotopes” refers to atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers resulting from a different number of neutrons in the nuclei. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Further, a compound, salt, or complex of the present disclosure can be prepared in combination with solvent or water molecules to form solvates and hydrates by routine methods.

Contacting: As used herein, the term “contacting” means establishing a physical connection between two or more entities. For example, contacting a mammalian cell with a nanoparticle composition means that the mammalian cell and a nanoparticle are made to share a physical connection. Methods of contacting cells with external entities both in vivo and ex vivo are well known in the biological arts. For example, contacting a nanoparticle composition and a mammalian cell disposed within a mammal can be performed by varied routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous) and can involve varied amounts of nanoparticle compositions. Moreover, more than one mammalian cell can be contacted by a nanoparticle composition.

Conservative amino acid substitution: A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue in a protein sequence is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, or histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, or cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, or tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, or histidine). Thus, if an amino acid in a polypeptide is replaced with another amino acid from the same side chain family, the amino acid substitution is considered to be conservative. In another aspect, a string of amino acids can be conservatively replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members.

Non-conservative amino acid substitution: Non-conservative amino acid substitutions include those in which (i) a residue having an electropositive side chain (e.g., Arg, His or Lys) is substituted for, or by, an electronegative residue (e.g., Glu or Asp), (ii) a hydrophilic residue (e.g., Ser or Thr) is substituted for, or by, a hydrophobic residue (e.g., Ala, Leu, Ile, Phe or Val), (iii) a cysteine or proline is substituted for, or by, any other residue, or (iv) a residue having a bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chain (e.g., Val, His, Ile or Trp) is substituted for, or by, one having a smaller side chain (e.g., Ala or Ser) or no side chain (e.g., Gly).

Other amino acid substitutions can be readily identified by workers of ordinary skill. For example, for the amino acid alanine, a substitution can be taken from any one of D-alanine, glycine, beta-alanine, L-cysteine and D-cysteine. For lysine, a replacement can be any one of D-lysine, arginine, D-arginine, homo-arginine, methionine, D-methionine, ornithine, or D-ornithine. Generally, substitutions in functionally important regions that can be expected to induce changes in the properties of isolated polypeptides are those in which (i) a polar residue, e.g., serine or threonine, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g., leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, or alanine; (ii) a cysteine residue is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (iii) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine, is substituted for (or by) a residue having an electronegative side chain, e.g., glutamic acid or aspartic acid; or (iv) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having such a side chain, e.g., glycine. The likelihood that one of the foregoing non-conservative substitutions can alter functional properties of the protein is also correlated to the position of the substitution with respect to functionally important regions of the protein: some non-conservative substitutions can accordingly have little or no effect on biological properties.

Conserved: As used herein, the term “conserved” refers to nucleotides or amino acid residues of a polynucleotide sequence or polypeptide sequence, respectively, that are those that occur unaltered in the same position of two or more sequences being compared. Nucleotides or amino acids that are relatively conserved are those that are conserved amongst more related sequences than nucleotides or amino acids appearing elsewhere in the sequences.

In some embodiments, two or more sequences are said to be “completely conserved” if they are 100% identical to one another. In some embodiments, two or more sequences are said to be “highly conserved” if they are at least 70% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 90% identical, or at least 95% identical to one another. In some embodiments, two or more sequences are said to be “highly conserved” if they are about 70% identical, about 80% identical, about 90% identical, about 95%, about 98%, or about 99% identical to one another. In some embodiments, two or more sequences are said to be “conserved” if they are at least 30% identical, at least 40% identical, at least 50% identical, at least 60% identical, at least 70% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 90% identical, or at least 95% identical to one another. In some embodiments, two or more sequences are said to be “conserved” if they are about 30% identical, about 40% identical, about 50% identical, about 60% identical, about 70% identical, about 80% identical, about 90% identical, about 95% identical, about 98% identical, or about 99% identical to one another. Conservation of sequence can apply to the entire length of a polynucleotide or polypeptide or can apply to a portion, region or feature thereof.

Controlled Release: As used herein, the term “controlled release” refers to a pharmaceutical composition or compound release profile that conforms to a particular pattern of release to effect a therapeutic outcome.

Cyclic or Cyclized: As used herein, the term “cyclic” refers to the presence of a continuous loop. Cyclic molecules need not be circular, only joined to form an unbroken chain of subunits. Cyclic molecules such as the engineered RNA or mRNA of the present invention can be single units or multimers or comprise one or more components of a complex or higher order structure.

Cytotoxic: As used herein, “cytotoxic” refers to killing or causing injurious, toxic, or deadly effect on a cell (e.g., a mammalian cell (e.g., a human cell)), bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, parasite, prion, or a combination thereof.

Delivering: As used herein, the term “delivering” means providing an entity to a destination. For example, delivering a polynucleotide to a subject can involve administering a nanoparticle composition including the polynucleotide to the subject (e.g., by an intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous route). Administration of a nanoparticle composition to a mammal or mammalian cell can involve contacting one or more cells with the nanoparticle composition.

Delivery Agent: As used herein, “delivery agent” refers to any substance that facilitates, at least in part, the in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo delivery of a polynucleotide to targeted cells.

Destabilized: As used herein, the term “destable,” “destabilize,” or “destabilizing region” means a region or molecule that is less stable than a starting, wild-type or native form of the same region or molecule.

Diastereomer: As used herein, the term “diastereomer,” means stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another and are non-superimposable on one another.

Digest: As used herein, the term “digest” means to break apart into smaller pieces or components. When referring to polypeptides or proteins, digestion results in the production of peptides.

Distal: As used herein, the term “distal” means situated away from the center or away from a point or region of interest.

Domain: As used herein, when referring to polypeptides, the term “domain” refers to a motif of a polypeptide having one or more identifiable structural or functional characteristics or properties (e.g., binding capacity, serving as a site for protein-protein interactions).

Dosing regimen: As used herein, a “dosing regimen” or a “dosing regimen” is a schedule of administration or physician determined regimen of treatment, prophylaxis, or palliative care.

Effective Amount: As used herein, the term “effective amount” of an agent is that amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results, for example, clinical results, and, as such, an “effective amount” depends upon the context in which it is being applied. For example, in the context of administering an agent that treats a protein deficiency (e.g., a G6PC deficiency), an effective amount of an agent is, for example, an amount of mRNA expressing sufficient G6PC to ameliorate, reduce, eliminate, or prevent the symptoms associated with the G6PC deficiency, as compared to the severity of the symptom observed without administration of the agent. The term “effective amount” can be used interchangeably with “effective dose,” “therapeutically effective amount,” or “therapeutically effective dose.”

Enantiomer: As used herein, the term “enantiomer” means each individual optically active form of a compound of the invention, having an optical purity or enantiomeric excess (as determined by methods standard in the art) of at least 80% (i.e., at least 90% of one enantiomer and at most 10% of the other enantiomer), at least 90%, or at least 98%.

Encapsulate: As used herein, the term “encapsulate” means to enclose, surround or encase.

Encapsulation Efficiency: As used herein, “encapsulation efficiency” refers to the amount of a polynucleotide that becomes part of a nanoparticle composition, relative to the initial total amount of polynucleotide used in the preparation of a nanoparticle composition. For example, if 97 mg of polynucleotide are encapsulated in a nanoparticle composition out of a total 100 mg of polynucleotide initially provided to the composition, the encapsulation efficiency can be given as 97%. As used herein, “encapsulation” can refer to complete, substantial, or partial enclosure, confinement, surrounding, or encasement.

Encoded protein cleavage signal: As used herein, “encoded protein cleavage signal” refers to the nucleotide sequence that encodes a protein cleavage signal.

Engineered: As used herein, embodiments of the invention are “engineered” when they are designed to have a feature or property, whether structural or chemical, that varies from a starting point, wild type or native molecule.

Enhanced Delivery: As used herein, the term “enhanced delivery” means delivery of more (e.g., at least 1.5 fold more, at least 2-fold more, at least 3-fold more, at least 4-fold more, at least 5-fold more, at least 6-fold more, at least 7-fold more, at least 8-fold more, at least 9-fold more, at least 10-fold more) of a polynucleotide by a nanoparticle to a target tissue of interest (e.g., mammalian liver) compared to the level of delivery of a polynucleotide by a control nanoparticle to a target tissue of interest (e.g., MC3, KC2, or DLinDMA). The level of delivery of a nanoparticle to a particular tissue can be measured by comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of polynucleotide in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the amount of total protein in said tissue, or comparing the amount of polynucleotide in a tissue to the amount of total polynucleotide in said tissue. It will be understood that the enhanced delivery of a nanoparticle to a target tissue need not be determined in a subject being treated, it can be determined in a surrogate such as an animal model (e.g., a rat model).

Exosome: As used herein, “exosome” is a vesicle secreted by mammalian cells or a complex involved in RNA degradation.

Expression: As used herein, “expression” of a nucleic acid sequence refers to one or more of the following events: (1) production of an mRNA template from a DNA sequence (e.g., by transcription); (2) processing of an mRNA transcript (e.g., by splicing, editing, 5′ cap formation, and/or 3′ end processing); (3) translation of an mRNA into a polypeptide or protein; and (4) post-translational modification of a polypeptide or protein.

Ex Vivo: As used herein, the term “ex vivo” refers to events that occur outside of an organism (e.g., animal, plant, or microbe or cell or tissue thereof). Ex vivo events can take place in an environment minimally altered from a natural (e.g., in vivo) environment.

Feature: As used herein, a “feature” refers to a characteristic, a property, or a distinctive element. When referring to polypeptides, “features” are defined as distinct amino acid sequence-based components of a molecule. Features of the polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides of the present invention include surface manifestations, local conformational shape, folds, loops, half-loops, domains, half-domains, sites, termini or any combination thereof.

Formulation: As used herein, a “formulation” includes at least a polynucleotide and one or more of a carrier, an excipient, and a delivery agent.

Fragment: A “fragment,” as used herein, refers to a portion. For example, fragments of proteins can comprise polypeptides obtained by digesting full-length protein isolated from cultured cells. In some embodiments, a fragment is a subsequence of a full-length protein (e.g., G6PC) wherein N-terminal, and/or C-terminal, and/or internal subsequences have been deleted. In some preferred aspects of the present invention, the fragments of a protein of the present invention are functional fragments.

Functional: As used herein, a “functional” biological molecule is a biological molecule in a form in which it exhibits a property and/or activity by which it is characterized. Thus, a functional fragment of a polynucleotide of the present invention is a polynucleotide capable of expressing a functional G6PC fragment. As used herein, a functional fragment of G6PC refers to a fragment of wild type G6PC (i.e., a fragment of any of its naturally occurring isoforms), or a mutant or variant thereof, wherein the fragment retains a least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the biological activity of the corresponding full length protein.

G6PC Associated Disease: As use herein the terms “G6PC-associated disease” or “G6PC-associated disorder” refer to diseases or disorders, respectively, which result from aberrant G6PC activity (e.g., decreased activity or increased activity). As a non-limiting example, GSD-IA is a G6PC associated disease.

The terms “G6PC enzymatic activity” and “G6PC activity,” are used interchangeably in the present disclosure and refer to G6PC's ability to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. Accordingly, a fragment or variant retaining or having G6PC enzymatic activity or G6PC activity refers to a fragment or variant that has measurable enzymatic activity in catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine.

Helper Lipid: As used herein, the term “helper lipid” refers to a compound or molecule that includes a lipidic moiety (for insertion into a lipid layer, e.g., lipid bilayer) and a polar moiety (for interaction with physiologic solution at the surface of the lipid layer). Typically, the helper lipid is a phospholipid. A function of the helper lipid is to “complement” the amino lipid and increase the fusogenicity of the bilayer and/or to help facilitate endosomal escape, e.g., of nucleic acid delivered to cells. Helper lipids are also believed to be a key structural component to the surface of the LNP.

Homology: As used herein, the term “homology” refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g. between nucleic acid molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Generally, the term “homology” implies an evolutionary relationship between two molecules. Thus, two molecules that are homologous will have a common evolutionary ancestor. In the context of the present invention, the term homology encompasses both to identity and similarity.

In some embodiments, polymeric molecules are considered to be “homologous” to one another if at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the monomers in the molecule are identical (exactly the same monomer) or are similar (conservative substitutions). The term “homologous” necessarily refers to a comparison between at least two sequences (polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences).

Identity: As used herein, the term “identity” refers to the overall monomer conservation between polymeric molecules, e.g., between polynucleotide molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Calculation of the percent identity of two polynucleotide sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second nucleic acid sequences for optimal alignment and non-identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. When comparing DNA and RNA, thymine (T) and uracil (U) can be considered equivalent.

Suitable software programs are available from various sources, and for alignment of both protein and nucleotide sequences. One suitable program to determine percent sequence identity is bl2seq, part of the BLAST suite of program available from the U.S. government's National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST web site (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Bl2seq performs a comparison between two sequences using either the BLASTN or BLASTP algorithm. BLASTN is used to compare nucleic acid sequences, while BLASTP is used to compare amino acid sequences. Other suitable programs are, e.g., Needle, Stretcher, Water, or Matcher, part of the EMBOSS suite of bioinformatics programs and also available from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) at www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa.

Sequence alignments can be conducted using methods known in the art such as MAFFT, Clustal (ClustalW, Clustal X or Clustal Omega), MUSCLE, etc.

Different regions within a single polynucleotide or polypeptide target sequence that aligns with a polynucleotide or polypeptide reference sequence can each have their own percent sequence identity. It is noted that the percent sequence identity value is rounded to the nearest tenth. For example, 80.11, 80.12, 80.13, and 80.14 are rounded down to 80.1, while 80.15, 80.16, 80.17, 80.18, and 80.19 are rounded up to 80.2. It also is noted that the length value will always be an integer.

In certain aspects, the percentage identity “% ID” of a first amino acid sequence (or nucleic acid sequence) to a second amino acid sequence (or nucleic acid sequence) is calculated as % ID=100×(Y/Z), where Y is the number of amino acid residues (or nucleobases) scored as identical matches in the alignment of the first and second sequences (as aligned by visual inspection or a particular sequence alignment program) and Z is the total number of residues in the second sequence. If the length of a first sequence is longer than the second sequence, the percent identity of the first sequence to the second sequence will be higher than the percent identity of the second sequence to the first sequence.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the generation of a sequence alignment for the calculation of a percent sequence identity is not limited to binary sequence-sequence comparisons exclusively driven by primary sequence data. It will also be appreciated that sequence alignments can be generated by integrating sequence data with data from heterogeneous sources such as structural data (e.g., crystallographic protein structures), functional data (e.g., location of mutations), or phylogenetic data. A suitable program that integrates heterogeneous data to generate a multiple sequence alignment is T-Coffee, available at www.tcoffee.org, and alternatively available, e.g., from the EBI. It will also be appreciated that the final alignment used to calculate percent sequence identity can be curated either automatically or manually.

Immune response: The term “immune response” refers to the action of, for example, lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, phagocytic cells, granulocytes, and soluble macromolecules produced by the above cells or the liver (including antibodies, cytokines, and complement) that results in selective damage to, destruction of, or elimination from the human body of invading pathogens, cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous cells, or, in cases of autoimmunity or pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues. In some cases, the administration of a nanoparticle comprising a lipid component and an encapsulated therapeutic agent can trigger an immune response, which can be caused by (i) the encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., an mRNA), (ii) the expression product of such encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., a polypeptide encoded by the mRNA), (iii) the lipid component of the nanoparticle, or (iv) a combination thereof.

Inflammatory response: “Inflammatory response” refers to immune responses involving specific and non-specific defense systems. A specific defense system reaction is a specific immune system reaction to an antigen. Examples of specific defense system reactions include antibody responses. A non-specific defense system reaction is an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes generally incapable of immunological memory, e.g., macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils. In some aspects, an immune response includes the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in elevated inflammatory cytokine levels.

Inflammatory cytokines: The term “inflammatory cytokine” refers to cytokines that are elevated in an inflammatory response. Examples of inflammatory cytokines include interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; also known as GROα, interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The term inflammatory cytokines includes also other cytokines associated with inflammatory responses known in the art, e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-13 (I1-13), interferon α (IFN-α), etc.

In Vitro: As used herein, the term “in vitro” refers to events that occur in an artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, in a Petri dish, etc., rather than within an organism (e.g., animal, plant, or microbe).

In Vivo: As used herein, the term “in vivo” refers to events that occur within an organism (e.g., animal, plant, or microbe or cell or tissue thereof).

Insertional and deletional variants: “Insertional variants” when referring to polypeptides are those with one or more amino acids inserted immediately adjacent to an amino acid at a particular position in a native or starting sequence. “Immediately adjacent” to an amino acid means connected to either the alpha-carboxy or alpha-amino functional group of the amino acid. “Deletional variants” when referring to polypeptides are those with one or more amino acids in the native or starting amino acid sequence removed. Ordinarily, deletional variants will have one or more amino acids deleted in a particular region of the molecule.

Intact: As used herein, in the context of a polypeptide, the term “intact” means retaining an amino acid corresponding to the wild type protein, e.g., not mutating or substituting the wild type amino acid. Conversely, in the context of a nucleic acid, the term “intact” means retaining a nucleobase corresponding to the wild type nucleic acid, e.g., not mutating or substituting the wild type nucleobase.

Ionizable amino lipid: The term “ionizable amino lipid” includes those lipids having one, two, three, or more fatty acid or fatty alkyl chains and a pH-titratable amino head group (e.g., an alkylamino or dialkylamino head group). An ionizable amino lipid is typically protonated (i.e., positively charged) at a pH below the pKa of the amino head group and is substantially not charged at a pH above the pKa. Such ionizable amino lipids include, but are not limited to DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) and (13Z,165Z)—N,N-dimethyl-3-nonydocosa-13-16-dien-1-amine (L608).

Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418, Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth (eds.), Wiley-VCH, 2008, and Berge et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 1-19 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate: The term “pharmaceutically acceptable solvate,” as used herein, means a compound of the invention wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal lattice. A suitable solvent is physiologically tolerable at the dosage administered. For example, solvates can be prepared by crystallization, recrystallization, or precipitation from a solution that includes organic solvents, water, or a mixture thereof. Examples of suitable solvents are ethanol, water (for example, mono-, di-, and tri-hydrates), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMEU), 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), acetonitrile (ACN), propylene glycol, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, 2-pyrrolidone, benzyl benzoate, and the like.

Pharmacokinetic: As used herein, “pharmacokinetic” refers to any one or more properties of a molecule or compound as it relates to the determination of the fate of substances administered to a living organism. Pharmacokinetics is divided into several areas including the extent and rate of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. This is commonly referred to as ADME where: (A) Absorption is the process of a substance entering the blood circulation; (D) Distribution is the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body; (M) Metabolism (or Biotransformation) is the irreversible transformation of parent compounds into daughter metabolites; and (E) Excretion (or Elimination) refers to the elimination of the substances from the body. In rare cases, some drugs irreversibly accumulate in body tissue.

Physicochemical: As used herein, “physicochemical” means of or relating to a physical and/or chemical property.

Polynucleotide: The term “polynucleotide” as used herein refers to polymers of nucleotides of any length, including ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, analogs thereof, or mixtures thereof. This term refers to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, the term includes triple-, double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”), as well as triple-, double- and single-stranded ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). It also includes modified, for example by alkylation, and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. More particularly, the term “polynucleotide” includes polydeoxyribonucleotides (containing 2-deoxy-D-ribose), polyribonucleotides (containing D-ribose), including tRNA, rRNA, hRNA, siRNA and mRNA, whether spliced or unspliced, any other type of polynucleotide which is an N- or C-glycoside of a purine or pyrimidine base, and other polymers containing normucleotidic backbones, for example, polyamide (e.g., peptide nucleic acids “PNAs”) and polymorpholino polymers, and other synthetic sequence-specific nucleic acid polymers providing that the polymers contain nucleobases in a configuration which allows for base pairing and base stacking, such as is found in DNA and RNA. In particular aspects, the polynucleotide comprises an mRNA. In other aspect, the mRNA is a synthetic mRNA. In some aspects, the synthetic mRNA comprises at least one unnatural nucleobase. In some aspects, all nucleobases of a certain class have been replaced with unnatural nucleobases (e.g., all uridines in a polynucleotide disclosed herein can be replaced with an unnatural nucleobase, e.g., 5-methoxyuridine). In some aspects, the polynucleotide (e.g., a synthetic RNA or a synthetic DNA) comprises only natural nucleobases, i.e., A (adenosine), G (guanosine), C (cytidine), and T (thymidine) in the case of a synthetic DNA, or A, C, G, and U (uridine) in the case of a synthetic RNA.

The skilled artisan will appreciate that the T bases in the codon maps disclosed herein are present in DNA, whereas the T bases would be replaced by U bases in corresponding RNAs. For example, a codon-nucleotide sequence disclosed herein in DNA form, e.g., a vector or an in-vitro translation (IVT) template, would have its T bases transcribed as U based in its corresponding transcribed mRNA. In this respect, both codon-optimized DNA sequences (comprising T) and their corresponding mRNA sequences (comprising U) are considered codon-optimized nucleotide sequence of the present invention. A skilled artisan would also understand that equivalent codon-maps can be generated by replaced one or more bases with non-natural bases. Thus, e.g., a TTC codon (DNA map) would correspond to a UUC codon (RNA map), which in turn would correspond to a ΨΨ-PC codon (RNA map in which U has been replaced with pseudouridine).

Standard A-T and G-C base pairs form under conditions which allow the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N3-H and C4-oxy of thymidine and the N1 and C6-NH2, respectively, of adenosine and between the C2-oxy, N3 and C4-NH2, of cytidine and the C2-NH2, N′—H and C6-oxy, respectively, of guanosine. Thus, for example, guanosine (2-amino-6-oxy-9-β-D-ribofuranosyl-purine) can be modified to form isoguanosine (2-oxy-6-amino-9-β-D-ribofuranosyl-purine). Such modification results in a nucleoside base which will no longer effectively form a standard base pair with cytosine. However, modification of cytosine (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-2-oxy-4-amino-pyrimidine) to form isocytosine (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-2-amino-4-oxy-pyrimidine-) results in a modified nucleotide which will not effectively base pair with guanosine but will form a base pair with isoguanosine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,702 to Collins et al.). Isocytosine is available from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.); isocytidine can be prepared by the method described by Switzer et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32:10489-10496 and references cited therein; 2′-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine can be prepared by the method of Tor et al., 1993, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115:4461-4467 and references cited therein; and isoguanine nucleotides can be prepared using the method described by Switzer et al., 1993, supra, and Mantsch et al., 1993, Biochem. 14:5593-5601, or by the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,610 to Collins et al. Other nonnatural base pairs can be synthesized by the method described in Piccirilli et al., 1990, Nature 343:33-37, for the synthesis of 2,6-diaminopyrimidine and its complement (1-methylpyrazolo-[4,3]pyrimidine-5,7-(4H,6H)-dione. Other such modified nucleotide units which form unique base pairs are known, such as those described in Leach et al. (1992) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:3675-3683 and Switzer et al., supra.

Polypeptide: The terms “polypeptide,” “peptide,” and “protein” are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer can comprise modified amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids such as homocysteine, ornithine, p-acetylphenylalanine, D-amino acids, and creatine), as well as other modifications known in the art.

The term, as used herein, refers to proteins, polypeptides, and peptides of any size, structure, or function. Polypeptides include encoded polynucleotide products, naturally occurring polypeptides, synthetic polypeptides, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, and analogs of the foregoing. A polypeptide can be a monomer or can be a multi-molecular complex such as a dimer, trimer or tetramer. They can also comprise single chain or multichain polypeptides. Most commonly disulfide linkages are found in multichain polypeptides. The term polypeptide can also apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues are an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, a “peptide” can be less than or equal to 50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acids long.

Polypeptide variant: As used herein, the term “polypeptide variant” refers to molecules that differ in their amino acid sequence from a native or reference sequence. The amino acid sequence variants can possess substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions at certain positions within the amino acid sequence, as compared to a native or reference sequence. Ordinarily, variants will possess at least about 50% identity, at least about 60% identity, at least about 70% identity, at least about 80% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 99% identity to a native or reference sequence.

The term encompasses both the signal sequence polypeptide and the nucleic acid sequence encoding the signal sequence. Thus, references to a signal sequence in the context of a nucleic acid refer in fact to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the signal sequence polypeptide.

Signal transduction pathway: A “signal transduction pathway” refers to the biochemical relationship between a variety of signal transduction molecules that play a role in the transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to another portion of a cell. As used herein, the phrase “cell surface receptor” includes, for example, molecules and complexes of molecules capable of receiving a signal and the transmission of such a signal across the plasma membrane of a cell.

An “off-target tissue” refers to any one or more tissue types in which the expression of the encoded protein does not result in a desired biological and/or pharmacological effect.

The presence of a therapeutic agent in an off-target issue can be the result of: (i) leakage of a polynucleotide from the administration site to peripheral tissue or distant off-target tissue via diffusion or through the bloodstream (e.g., a polynucleotide intended to express a polypeptide in a certain tissue would reach the off-target tissue and the polypeptide would be expressed in the off-target tissue); or (ii) leakage of an polypeptide after administration of a polynucleotide encoding such polypeptide to peripheral tissue or distant off-target tissue via diffusion or through the bloodstream (e.g., a polynucleotide would expressed a polypeptide in the target tissue, and the polypeptide would diffuse to peripheral tissue).

Targeting sequence: As used herein, the phrase “targeting sequence” refers to a sequence that can direct the transport or localization of a protein or polypeptide.

Terminus: As used herein the terms “termini” or “terminus,” when referring to polypeptides, refers to an extremity of a peptide or polypeptide.

The polypeptide based molecules of the invention can be characterized as having both an N-terminus (terminated by an amino acid with a free amino group (NH2)) and a C-terminus (terminated by an amino acid with a free carboxyl group (COOH)). Proteins of the invention are in some cases made up of multiple polypeptide chains brought together by disulfide bonds or by non-covalent forces (multimers, oligomers). These sorts of proteins will have multiple N- and C-termini.

Total daily dose: As used herein, a “total daily dose” is an amount given or prescribed in 24 hr. period. The total daily dose can be administered as a single unit dose or a split dose.

Transcription factor: As used herein, the term “transcription factor” refers to a DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription of DNA into RNA, for example, by activation or repression of transcription. Some transcription factors effect regulation of transcription alone, while others act in concert with other proteins. Some transcription factor can both activate and repress transcription under certain conditions. In general, transcription factors bind a specific target sequence or sequences highly similar to a specific consensus sequence in a regulatory region of a target gene. Transcription factors can regulate transcription of a target gene alone or in a complex with other molecules.

For example, “treating” GSD-Ia can refer to diminishing symptoms associate with the disease, prolong the lifespan (increase the survival rate) of patients, reducing the severity of the disease, preventing or delaying the onset of the disease, etc. Treatment can be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease, disorder, and/or condition and/or to a subject who exhibits only early signs of a disease, disorder, and/or condition for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease, disorder, and/or condition.

Unmodified: As used herein, “unmodified” refers to any substance, compound or molecule prior to being changed in some way. Unmodified can, but does not always, refer to the wild type or native form of a biomolecule. Molecules can undergo a series of modifications whereby each modified molecule can serve as the “unmodified” starting molecule for a subsequent modification.

Uracil: Uracil is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of RNA, and it is represented by the letter U. Uracil can be attached to a ribose ring, or more specifically, a ribofuranose via a β-N1-glycosidic bond to yield the nucleoside uridine. The nucleoside uridine is also commonly abbreviated according to the one letter code of its nucleobase, i.e., U. Thus, in the context of the present disclosure, when a monomer in a polynucleotide sequence is U, such U is designated interchangeably as a “uracil” or a “uridine.”

Uridine Content: The terms “uridine content” or “uracil content” are interchangeable and refer to the amount of uracil or uridine present in a certain nucleic acid sequence. Uridine content or uracil content can be expressed as an absolute value (total number of uridine or uracil in the sequence) or relative (uridine or uracil percentage respect to the total number of nucleobases in the nucleic acid sequence).

Uridine-Modified Sequence: The terms “uridine-modified sequence” refers to a sequence optimized nucleic acid (e.g., a synthetic mRNA sequence) with a different overall or local uridine content (higher or lower uridine content) or with different uridine patterns (e.g., gradient distribution or clustering) with respect to the uridine content and/or uridine patterns of a candidate nucleic acid sequence. In the content of the present disclosure, the terms “uridine-modified sequence” and “uracil-modified sequence” are considered equivalent and interchangeable.

A “high uridine codon” is defined as a codon comprising two or three uridines, a “low uridine codon” is defined as a codon comprising one uridine, and a “no uridine codon” is a codon without any uridines. In some embodiments, a uridine-modified sequence comprises substitutions of high uridine codons with low uridine codons, substitutions of high uridine codons with no uridine codons, substitutions of low uridine codons with high uridine codons, substitutions of low uridine codons with no uridine codons, substitution of no uridine codons with low uridine codons, substitutions of no uridine codons with high uridine codons, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a high uridine codon can be replaced with another high uridine codon. In some embodiments, a low uridine codon can be replaced with another low uridine codon. In some embodiments, a no uridine codon can be replaced with another no uridine codon. A uridine-modified sequence can be uridine enriched or uridine rarefied.

Uridine Enriched: As used herein, the terms “uridine enriched” and grammatical variants refer to the increase in uridine content (expressed in absolute value or as a percentage value) in a sequence optimized nucleic acid (e.g., a synthetic mRNA sequence) with respect to the uridine content of the corresponding candidate nucleic acid sequence. Uridine enrichment can be implemented by substituting codons in the candidate nucleic acid sequence with synonymous codons containing less uridine nucleobases. Uridine enrichment can be global (i.e., relative to the entire length of a candidate nucleic acid sequence) or local (i.e., relative to a subsequence or region of a candidate nucleic acid sequence).

Uridine Rarefied: As used herein, the terms “uridine rarefied” and grammatical variants refer to a decrease in uridine content (expressed in absolute value or as a percentage value) in a sequence optimized nucleic acid (e.g., a synthetic mRNA sequence) with respect to the uridine content of the corresponding candidate nucleic acid sequence. Uridine rarefication can be implemented by substituting codons in the candidate nucleic acid sequence with synonymous codons containing less uridine nucleobases. Uridine rarefication can be global (i.e., relative to the entire length of a candidate nucleic acid sequence) or local (i.e., relative to a subsequence or region of a candidate nucleic acid sequence).

Variant: The term variant as used in present disclosure refers to both natural variants (e.g., polymorphisms, isoforms, etc.) and artificial variants in which at least one amino acid residue in a native or starting sequence (e.g., a wild type sequence) has been removed and a different amino acid inserted in its place at the same position. These variants can be described as “substitutional variants.” The substitutions can be single, where only one amino acid in the molecule has been substituted, or they can be multiple, where two or more amino acids have been substituted in the same molecule. If amino acids are inserted or deleted, the resulting variant would be an “insertional variant” or a “deletional variant” respectively.

Initiation Codon: As used herein, the term “initiation codon”, used interchangeably with the term “start codon”, refers to the first codon of an open reading frame that is translated by the ribosome and is comprised of a triplet of linked adenine-uracil-guanine nucleobases. The initiation codon is depicted by the first letter codes of adenine (A), uracil (U), and guanine (G) and is often written simply as “AUG”. Although natural mRNAs may use codons other than AUG as the initiation codon, which are referred to herein as “alternative initiation codons”, the initiation codons of polynucleotides described herein use the AUG codon. During the process of translation initiation, the sequence comprising the initiation codon is recognized via complementary base-pairing to the anticodon of an initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) bound by the ribosome. Open reading frames may contain more than one AUG initiation codon, which are referred to herein as “alternate initiation codons”.

The initiation codon plays a critical role in translation initiation. The initiation codon is the first codon of an open reading frame that is translated by the ribosome. Typically, the initiation codon comprises the nucleotide triplet AUG, however, in some instances translation initiation can occur at other codons comprised of distinct nucleotides. The initiation of translation in eukaryotes is a multistep biochemical process that involves numerous protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions between messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs), the 40S ribosomal subunit, other components of the translation machinery (e.g., eukaryotic initiation factors; eIFs). The current model of mRNA translation initiation postulates that the pre-initiation complex (alternatively “43S pre-initiation complex”; abbreviated as “PIC”) translocates from the site of recruitment on the mRNA (typically the 5′ cap) to the initiation codon by scanning nucleotides in a 5′ to 3′ direction until the first AUG codon that resides within a specific translation-promotive nucleotide context (the Kozak sequence) is encountered (Kozak (1989) J Cell Biol 108:229-241). Scanning by the PIC ends upon complementary base-pairing between nucleotides comprising the anticodon of the initiator Met-tRNAiMet transfer RNA and nucleotides comprising the initiation codon of the mRNA. Productive base-pairing between the AUG codon and the Met-tRNAiMet anticodon elicits a series of structural and biochemical events that culminate in the joining of the large 60S ribosomal subunit to the PIC to form an active ribosome that is competent for translation elongation.

Kozak Sequence: The term “Kozak sequence” (also referred to as “Kozak consensus sequence”) refers to a translation initiation enhancer element to enhance expression of a gene or open reading frame, and which in eukaryotes, is located in the 5′ UTR. The Kozak consensus sequence was originally defined as the sequence  (SEQ ID NO:41), where R=a purine, following an analysis of the effects of single mutations surrounding the initiation codon (AUG) on translation of the preproinsulin gene (Kozak (1986) Cell 44:283-292). Polynucleotides disclosed herein comprise a Kozak consensus sequence, or a derivative or modification thereof (Examples of translational enhancer compositions and methods of use thereof, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,707 to Andrews et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,332 to Chernajovsky, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,665 to Wilson, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.)

Modified: As used herein “modified” or “modification” refers to a changed state or a change in composition or structure of a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA). Polynucleotides may be modified in various ways including chemically, structurally, and/or functionally. For example, polynucleotides may be structurally modified by the incorporation of one or more RNA elements, wherein the RNA element comprises a sequence and/or an RNA secondary structure(s) that provides one or more functions (e.g., translational regulatory activity). Accordingly, polynucleotides of the disclosure may be comprised of one or more modifications (e.g., may include one or more chemical, structural, or functional modifications, including any combination thereof).

Nucleobase: As used herein, the term “nucleobase” (alternatively “nucleotide base” or “nitrogenous base”) refers to a purine or pyrimidine heterocyclic compound found in nucleic acids, including any derivatives or analogs of the naturally occurring purines and pyrimidines that confer improved properties (e.g., binding affinity, nuclease resistance, chemical stability) to a nucleic acid or a portion or segment thereof. Adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil are the nucleobases predominately found in natural nucleic acids. Other natural, non-natural, and/or synthetic nucleobases, as known in the art and/or described herein, can be incorporated into nucleic acids.

Nucleoside/Nucleotide: As used herein, the term “nucleoside” refers to a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a ribose in RNA or a deoxyribose in DNA), or derivative or analog thereof, covalently linked to a nucleobase (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine), or a derivative or analog thereof (also referred to herein as “nucleobase”), but lacking an internucleoside linking group (e.g., a phosphate group). As used herein, the term “nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside covalently bonded to an internucleoside linking group (e.g., a phosphate group), or any derivative, analog, or modification thereof that confers improved chemical and/or functional properties (e.g., binding affinity, nuclease resistance, chemical stability) to a nucleic acid or a portion or segment thereof.

Nucleic acid: As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” is used in its broadest sense and encompasses any compound and/or substance that includes a polymer of nucleotides, or derivatives or analogs thereof. These polymers are often referred to as “polynucleotides”. Accordingly, as used herein the terms “nucleic acid” and “polynucleotide” are equivalent and are used interchangeably. Exemplary nucleic acids or polynucleotides of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, ribonucleic acids (RNAs), deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), DNA-RNA hybrids, RNAi-inducing agents, RNAi agents, siRNAs, shRNAs, mRNAs, modified mRNAs, miRNAs, antisense RNAs, ribozymes, catalytic DNA, RNAs that induce triple helix formation, threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs, including LNA having a β-D-ribo configuration, α-LNA having an α-L-ribo configuration (a diastereomer of LNA), 2′-amino-LNA having a 2′-amino functionalization, and 2′-amino-α-LNA having a 2′-amino functionalization) or hybrids thereof.

Nucleic Acid Structure: As used herein, the term “nucleic acid structure” (used interchangeably with “polynucleotide structure”) refers to the arrangement or organization of atoms, chemical constituents, elements, motifs, and/or sequence of linked nucleotides, or derivatives or analogs thereof, that comprise a nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA). The term also refers to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional state of a nucleic acid. Accordingly, the term “RNA structure” refers to the arrangement or organization of atoms, chemical constituents, elements, motifs, and/or sequence of linked nucleotides, or derivatives or analogs thereof, comprising an RNA molecule (e.g., an mRNA) and/or refers to a two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional state of an RNA molecule. Nucleic acid structure can be further demarcated into four organizational categories referred to herein as “molecular structure”, “primary structure”, “secondary structure”, and “tertiary structure” based on increasing organizational complexity.

Open Reading Frame: As used herein, the term “open reading frame”, abbreviated as “ORF”, refers to a segment or region of an mRNA molecule that encodes a polypeptide. The ORF comprises a continuous stretch of non-overlapping, in-frame codons, beginning with the initiation codon and ending with a stop codon, and is translated by the ribosome.

Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC): As used herein, the term “pre-initiation complex” (alternatively “43S pre-initiation complex”; abbreviated as “PIC”) refers to a ribonucleoprotein complex comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5), and the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex, that is intrinsically capable of attachment to the 5′ cap of an mRNA molecule and, after attachment, of performing ribosome scanning of the 5′ UTR.

RNA element: As used herein, the term “RNA element” refers to a portion, fragment, or segment of an RNA molecule that provides a biological function and/or has biological activity (e.g., translational regulatory activity). Modification of a polynucleotide by the incorporation of one or more RNA elements, such as those described herein, provides one or more desirable functional properties to the modified polynucleotide. RNA elements, as described herein, can be naturally-occurring, non-naturally occurring, synthetic, engineered, or any combination thereof. For example, naturally-occurring RNA elements that provide a regulatory activity include elements found throughout the transcriptomes of viruses, prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (e.g., humans). RNA elements in particular eukaryotic mRNAs and translated viral RNAs have been shown to be involved in mediating many functions in cells. Exemplary natural RNA elements include, but are not limited to, translation initiation elements (e.g., internal ribosome entry site (IRES), see Kieft et al., (2001) RNA 7(2):194-206), translation enhancer elements (e.g., the APP mRNA translation enhancer element, see Rogers et al., (1999) J Biol Chem 274(10):6421-6431), mRNA stability elements (e.g., AU-rich elements (AREs), see Garneau et al., (2007) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 8(2):113-126), translational repression element (see e.g., Blumer et al., (2002) Mech Dev 110(1-2):97-112), protein-binding RNA elements (e.g., iron-responsive element, see Selezneva et al., (2013) J Mol Biol 425(18):3301-3310), cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (Villalba et al., (2011) Curr Opin Genet Dev 21(4):452-457), and catalytic RNA elements (e.g., ribozymes, see Scott et al., (2009) Biochim Biophys Acta 1789(9-10):634-641).

Residence time: As used herein, the term “residence time” refers to the time of occupancy of a pre-initiation complex (PIC) or a ribosome at a discrete position or location along an mRNA molecule.

Translational Regulatory Activity: As used herein, the term “translational regulatory activity” (used interchangeably with “translational regulatory function”) refers to a biological function, mechanism, or process that modulates (e.g., regulates, influences, controls, varies) the activity of the translational apparatus, including the activity of the PIC and/or ribosome. In some aspects, the desired translation regulatory activity promotes and/or enhances the translational fidelity of mRNA translation. In some aspects, the desired translational regulatory activity reduces and/or inhibits leaky scanning.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

**Chimeric Polynucleotide Synthesis**

**A. Triphosphate Route**

Two regions or parts of a chimeric polynucleotide can be joined or ligated using triphosphate chemistry. According to this method, a first region or part of 100 nucleotides or less can be chemically synthesized with a 5′ monophosphate and terminal 3′desOH or blocked OH. If the region is longer than 80 nucleotides, it can be synthesized as two strands for ligation.

If the first region or part is synthesized as a non-positionally modified region or part using in vitro transcription (IVT), conversion the 5′monophosphate with subsequent capping of the 3′ terminus can follow. Monophosphate protecting groups can be selected from any of those known in the art.

The second region or part of the chimeric polynucleotide can be synthesized using either chemical synthesis or IVT methods. IVT methods can include an RNA polymerase that can utilize a primer with a modified cap. Alternatively, a cap of up to 80 nucleotides can be chemically synthesized and coupled to the IVT region or part.

It is noted that for ligation methods, ligation with DNA T4 ligase, followed by treatment with DNAse should readily avoid concatenation.

The entire chimeric polynucleotide need not be manufactured with a phosphate-sugar backbone. If one of the regions or parts encodes a polypeptide, then such region or part can comprise a phosphate-sugar backbone.

Ligation can then be performed using any known click chemistry, orthoclick chemistry, solulink, or other bioconjugate chemistries known to those in the art.

**B. Synthetic Route**

The chimeric polynucleotide can be made using a series of starting segments. Such segments include:

(a) Capped and protected 5′ segment comprising a normal 3′OH (SEG. 1)

(b) 5′ triphosphate segment which can include the coding region of a polypeptide and comprising a normal 3′OH (SEG. 2)

(c) 5′ monophosphate segment for the 3′ end of the chimeric polynucleotide (e.g., the tail) comprising cordycepin or no 3′OH (SEG. 3)

After synthesis (chemical or IVT), segment 3 (SEG. 3) can be treated with cordycepin and then with pyrophosphatase to create the 5′monophosphate.

Segment 2 (SEG. 2) can then be ligated to SEG. 3 using RNA ligase. The ligated polynucleotide can then be purified and treated with pyrophosphatase to cleave the diphosphate. The treated SEG.2-SEG. 3 construct is then purified and SEG. 1 is ligated to the 5′ terminus. A further purification step of the chimeric polynucleotide can be performed.

Where the chimeric polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide, the ligated or joined segments can be represented as: 5′ UTR (SEG. 1), open reading frame or ORF (SEG. 2) and 3′ UTR+PolyA (SEG. 3).

The yields of each step can be as much as 90-95%.

### Example 2

**PCR for cDNA Production**

PCR procedures for the preparation of cDNA can be performed using 2×KAPA HIFI™ HotStart ReadyMix by Kapa Biosystems (Woburn, Mass.). This system includes 2×KAPA ReadyMix 12.5 μl; Forward Primer (10 μM) 0.75 μl; Reverse Primer (10 μM) 0.75 μl; Template cDNA −100 ng; and dH2O diluted to 25.0 μl. The PCR reaction conditions can be: at 95° C. for 5 min. and 25 cycles of 98° C. for 20 sec, then 58° C. for 15 sec, then 72° C. for 45 sec, then 72° C. for 5 min. then 4° C. to termination.

The reverse primer of the instant invention can incorporate a poly-T120 (SEQ ID NO:234) for a poly-A120 (SEQ ID NO:233) in the mRNA. Other reverse primers with longer or shorter poly(T) tracts can be used to adjust the length of the poly(A) tail in the polynucleotide mRNA.

The reaction can be cleaned up using Invitrogen's PURELINK™ PCR Micro Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.) per manufacturer's instructions (up to 5 μg). Larger reactions will require a cleanup using a product with a larger capacity. Following the cleanup, the cDNA can be quantified using the NANODROP™ and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the cDNA is the expected size. The cDNA can then be submitted for sequencing analysis before proceeding to the in vitro transcription reaction.

### Example 3

**In Vitro Transcription (IVT)**

The in vitro transcription reactions can generate polynucleotides containing uniformly modified polynucleotides. Such uniformly modified polynucleotides can comprise a region or part of the polynucleotides of the invention. The input nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) mix can be made using natural and un-natural NTPs.

A typical in vitro transcription reaction can include the following:


- 1 Template cDNA—1.0
- 2 10× transcription buffer (400 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 190 mM MgCl₂, 50
  mM DTT, 10 mM Spermidine)—2.0
- 3 Custom NTPs (25 mM each)—7.2 μl
- 4 RNase Inhibitor—20 U
- 5 T7 RNA polymerase—3000 U
- 6 dH₂O—Up to 20.0 μl. and
- 7 Incubation at 37° C. for 3 hr-5 hours.

The crude IVT mix can be stored at 4° C. overnight for cleanup the next day. 1 U of RNase-free DNase can then be used to digest the original template. After 15 minutes of incubation at 37° C., the mRNA can be purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. This kit can purify up to 500 μg of RNA. Following the cleanup, the RNA can be quantified using the NanoDrop and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred.

### Example 4

**Enzymatic Capping**

Capping of a polynucleotide can be performed with a mixture includes: IVT RNA 60 μg-180 μg and dH2O up to 72 μl. The mixture can be incubated at 65° C. for 5 minutes to denature RNA, and then can be transferred immediately to ice.

The protocol can then involve the mixing of 10× Capping Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2) (10.0 μl); 20 mM GTP (5.0 μl); 20 mM S-Adenosyl Methionine (2.5 μl); RNase Inhibitor (100 U); 2′-O-Methyltransferase (400U); Vaccinia capping enzyme (Guanylyl transferase) (40 U); dH2O (Up to 28 μl); and incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes for 60 μg RNA or up to 2 hours for 180 μg of RNA.

The polynucleotide can then be purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following the cleanup, the RNA can be quantified using the NANODROP™ (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass.) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred. The RNA product can also be sequenced by running a reverse-transcription-PCR to generate the cDNA for sequencing.

### Example 5

**PolyA Tailing Reaction**

Without a poly-T in the cDNA, a poly-A tailing reaction must be performed before cleaning the final product. This can be done by mixing Capped IVT RNA (100 μl); RNase Inhibitor (20 U); 10× Tailing Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2) (12.0 μl); 20 mM ATP (6.0 μl); Poly-A Polymerase (20 U); dH2O up to 123.5 μl and incubating at 37° C. for 30 min. If the poly-A tail is already in the transcript, then the tailing reaction can be skipped and proceed directly to cleanup with Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ kit (Austin, Tex.) (up to 500 μg). Poly-A Polymerase is, in some cases, a recombinant enzyme expressed in yeast.

It should be understood that the processivity or integrity of the polyA tailing reaction does not always result in an exact size polyA tail. Hence polyA tails of approximately between 40-200 nucleotides, e.g., about 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 150-165, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 or 165 are within the scope of the invention.

### Example 6

**Natural 5′ Caps and 5′ Cap Analogues**

5′-capping of polynucleotides can be completed concomitantly during the in vitro-transcription reaction using the following chemical RNA cap analogs to generate the 5′-guanosine cap structure according to manufacturer protocols: 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′) G [the ARCA cap]; G(5′)ppp(5′)A; G(5′)ppp(5′)G; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)A; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). 5′-capping of modified RNA can be completed post-transcriptionally using a Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme to generate the “Cap 0” structure: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). Cap 1 structure can be generated using both Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and a 2′-O methyl-transferase to generate: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-2′-O-methyl. Cap 2 structure can be generated from the Cap 1 structure followed by the 2′-O-methylation of the 5′-antepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Cap 3 structure can be generated from the Cap 2 structure followed by the 2′-O-methylation of the 5′-preantepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Enzymes can be derived from a recombinant source.

When transfected into mammalian cells, the modified mRNAs can have a stability of between 12-18 hours or more than 18 hours, e.g., 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 or greater than 72 hours.

### Example 7

**Capping Assays**

**A. Protein Expression Assay**

Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein, can be transfected into cells at equal concentrations. After 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection, the amount of protein secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA. Synthetic polynucleotides that secrete higher levels of protein into the medium would correspond to a synthetic polynucleotide with a higher translationally-competent Cap structure.

**B. Purity Analysis Synthesis**

Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein, can be compared for purity using denaturing Agarose-Urea gel electrophoresis or HPLC analysis. Polynucleotides with a single, consolidated band by electrophoresis correspond to the higher purity product compared to polynucleotides with multiple bands or streaking bands. Synthetic polynucleotides with a single HPLC peak would also correspond to a higher purity product. The capping reaction with a higher efficiency would provide a more pure polynucleotide population.

**C. Cytokine Analysis**

Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein, can be transfected into cells at multiple concentrations. After 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-beta secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA. Polynucleotides resulting in the secretion of higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the medium would correspond to polynucleotides containing an immune-activating cap structure.

**D. Capping Reaction Efficiency**

Polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein, can be analyzed for capping reaction efficiency by LC-MS after nuclease treatment. Nuclease treatment of capped polynucleotides would yield a mixture of free nucleotides and the capped 5′-5-triphosphate cap structure detectable by LC-MS. The amount of capped product on the LC-MS spectra can be expressed as a percent of total polynucleotide from the reaction and would correspond to capping reaction efficiency. The cap structure with higher capping reaction efficiency would have a higher amount of capped product by LC-MS.

### Example 8

**Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Modified RNA or RT PCR Products**

Individual polynucleotides (200-400 ng in a 20 μl volume) or reverse transcribed PCR products (200-400 ng) can be loaded into a well on a non-denaturing 1.2% Agarose E-Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and run for 12-15 minutes according to the manufacturer protocol.

### Example 9

**Nanodrop Modified RNA Quantification and UV Spectral Data**

Modified polynucleotides in TE buffer (1 μl) can be used for Nanodrop UV absorbance readings to quantitate the yield of each polynucleotide from a chemical synthesis or in vitro transcription reaction.

**Example 10**

**Formulation of Modified mRNA Using Lipidoids**

Polynucleotides can be formulated for in vitro experiments by mixing the polynucleotides with the lipidoid at a set ratio prior to addition to cells. In vivo formulation can require the addition of extra ingredients to facilitate circulation throughout the body. To test the ability of these lipidoids to form particles suitable for in vivo work, a standard formulation process used for siRNA-lipidoid formulations can be used as a starting point. After formation of the particle, polynucleotide can be added and allowed to integrate with the complex. The encapsulation efficiency can be determined using a standard dye exclusion assays.

**Example 11**

**Method of Screening for Protein Expression**

**A. Electrospray Ionization**

A biological sample that can contain proteins encoded by a polynucleotide administered to the subject can be prepared and analyzed according to the manufacturer protocol for electrospray ionization (ESI) using 1, 2, 3 or 4 mass analyzers. A biologic sample can also be analyzed using a tandem ESI mass spectrometry system.

Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, can be compared to known controls for a given protein and identity can be determined by comparison.

**B. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization**

A biological sample that can contain proteins encoded by one or more polynucleotides administered to the subject can be prepared and analyzed according to the manufacturer protocol for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).

Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, can be compared to known controls for a given protein and identity can be determined by comparison.

**C. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry**

A biological sample, which can contain proteins encoded by one or more polynucleotides, can be treated with a trypsin enzyme to digest the proteins contained within. The resulting peptides can be analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The peptides can be fragmented in the mass spectrometer to yield diagnostic patterns that can be matched to protein sequence databases via computer algorithms. The digested sample can be diluted to achieve 1 ng or less starting material for a given protein. Biological samples containing a simple buffer background (e.g., water or volatile salts) are amenable to direct in-solution digest; more complex backgrounds (e.g., detergent, non-volatile salts, glycerol) require an additional clean-up step to facilitate the sample analysis.

Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, can be compared to known controls for a given protein and identity can be determined by comparison.

**Example 12**

**Synthesis of mRNA Encoding G6PC**

Sequence optimized polynucleotides encoding G6PC polypeptides are synthesized and characterized as described in Examples 1 to 11.

An mRNA encoding human G6PC or a mutated variant thereof can be constructed, e.g., by using the ORF sequence (amino acid) provided in SEQ ID NO: 194, 199 or 205, respectively. The mRNA sequence includes both 5′ and 3′ UTR regions flanking the ORF sequence (nucleotide). In an exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 150, respectively.

In another exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NOs.: 3 and 175, respectively (see below):

In another exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NOs.: 3 and 4, respectively (see below):

In another exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NOs.: 3 and 177, respectively (see below):

In another exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NOs.: 3 and 178, respectively (see below):

In another exemplary construct, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR sequences are SEQ ID NOs.: 193 and 150, respectively (see below):

The G6PC mRNA sequence is prepared as modified mRNA. Specifically, during in vitro transcription, modified mRNA can be generated using N1-methylpseudouridine-5′-triphosphate to ensure that the mRNAs contain 100% N1-methylpseudouridine instead of uridine. Further, G6PC-mRNA can be synthesized with a primer that introduces a polyA-tail, and a Cap 1 structure is generated on both mRNAs using Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and a 2′-O methyl-transferase to generate: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-2′-O-methyl.

**Example 13**

**In Vitro Expression of mRNA Encoding G6Pase**

The in vitro expression of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA constructs encoding human G6PC (hG6PC; SEQ ID NO:48), a FLAG-tagged hG6PC (SEQ ID NO:45), mouse G6PC (mG6PC; SEQ ID NO:46), and a FLAG-tagged mG6PC (SEQ ID NO:47) was measured in a human embryonic kidney cell line. HEK 293 cells (ATCC®CRL1573™), were seeded on 6-well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) one day prior to transfection. Modified mRNA formulations encoding each of the human or mouse G6PC sequences, or a GFP control, were transfected using 2 μg mRNA and 6 μL Lipofectamine MessengerMAX in 250 μL OPTI-MEM per well and incubated.

After 24 hours, the cells were lysed using a consistent amount of lysis buffer. Protein concentrations of each were determined. To analyze G6PC expression, equal loads of each lysate containing 20 μg of total protein were prepared in a loading buffer and subjected to capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis. Beta-actin was used as a control. For detection of G6PC, commercial antibodies were used (Atlas HPA052324 anti-G6PC antibody) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were compared to G6PC expression levels in mock transfected cells.

FIG. 1A shows that G6PC was expressed from each of the mRNA constructs, but was not detected in cells transfected with eGFP mRNA or in mock transfected cells. FIG. 1B shows the relative expression levels of each of the constructs derived from a quantitative analysis of the CE signals.

Transfection of primary patient fibroblasts with an mRNA encoding human G6PC (SEQ ID NO:48) resulted in G6PC that localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (data not shown). The G6PC protein co-localized with calnexin (detected with calnexin-specific antibody, Abcam 22595), an ER-specific marker (data not shown).

**Example 14**

**In Vitro Activity of mRNA-Encoded G6Pase**

An in vitro G6PC activity assay was performed to determine whether G6PC exogenously-expressed after introduction of mRNA comprising a G6PC sequence is active.

**A. Expression Assay**

HEK 293 cells were transfected with mRNA formulations comprising human G6PC (hG6PC; SEQ ID NO:48), a FLAG-tagged hG6PC (SEQ ID NO:45), mouse G6PC (mG6PC; SEQ ID NO:46), or a FLAG-tagged mG6PC (SEQ ID NO:47), or a GFP control. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamin 2000 and lysed as described in Example 13 above.

**B. Activity Assay**

To assess whether mRNA-expressed G6PC can function, an in vitro activity assay was performed using transfected HEK 293 cell lysates as the source of enzymatic activity. G6PC catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-P into glucose and inorganic phosphate (Pi). A Taussky-Shorr Color Reagent assay was used to determine the levels of inorganic phosphate in transfected cells, thereby indicating the activity level of G6PC (see Taussky and Shorr, J. Biol. Chem. 1953, 202(2):675-685, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, and FIG. 2A). FIG. 2B shows that HEK 293 cells transfected with each of the mRNAs encoding human G6PC (hG6PC; SEQ ID NO:48), a FLAG-tagged hG6PC (SEQ ID NO:45), mouse G6PC (mG6PC; SEQ ID NO:46), or a FLAG-tagged mG6PC (SEQ ID NO:47) expressed G6PC that exhibited G6Pase activity, as exhibited by increases in Pi levels relative to eGFP control or mock transfected cells.

**Example 15**

**Production of Nanoparticle Compositions**

**A. Production of Nanoparticle Compositions**

Nanoparticles can be made with mixing processes such as microfluidics and T-junction mixing of two fluid streams, one of which contains the polynucleotide and the other has the lipid components.

Lipid compositions are prepared by combining an ionizable amino lipid disclosed herein, e.g., a lipid according to Formula (I) such as Compound II or a lipid according to Formula (III) such as Compound VI, a phospholipid (such as DOPE or DSPC, obtainable from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), a PEG lipid (such as 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol methoxypolyethylene glycol, also known as PEG-DMG, obtainable from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), and a structural lipid (such as cholesterol, obtainable from Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany, or a corticosteroid (such as prednisolone, dexamethasone, prednisone, and hydrocortisone), or a combination thereof) at concentrations of about 50 mM in ethanol. Solutions should be refrigerated for storage at, for example, −20° C. Lipids are combined to yield desired molar ratios and diluted with water and ethanol to a final lipid concentration of between about 5.5 mM and about 25 mM.

Nanoparticle compositions including a polynucleotide and a lipid composition are prepared by combining the lipid solution with a solution including the a polynucleotide at lipid composition to polynucleotide wt:wt ratios between about 5:1 and about 50:1. The lipid solution is rapidly injected using a NanoAssemblr microfluidic based system at flow rates between about 10 ml/min and about 18 ml/min into the polynucleotide solution to produce a suspension with a water to ethanol ratio between about 1:1 and about 4:1.

For nanoparticle compositions including an RNA, solutions of the RNA at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml in deionized water are diluted in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at a pH between 3 and 4 to form a stock solution.

Nanoparticle compositions can be processed by dialysis to remove ethanol and achieve buffer exchange. Formulations are dialyzed twice against phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at volumes 200 times that of the primary product using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, Ill.) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kD. The first dialysis is carried out at room temperature for 3 hours. The formulations are then dialyzed overnight at 4° C. The resulting nanoparticle suspension is filtered through 0.2 μm sterile filters (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) into glass vials and sealed with crimp closures. Nanoparticle composition solutions of 0.01 mg/ml to 0.10 mg/ml are generally obtained.

The method described above induces nano-precipitation and particle formation. Alternative processes including, but not limited to, T-junction and direct injection, can be used to achieve the same nano-precipitation.

**B. Characterization of Nanoparticle Compositions**

A Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) can be used to determine the particle size, the polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential of the nanoparticle compositions in 1×PBS in determining particle size and 15 mM PBS in determining zeta potential.

Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration of a polynucleotide (e.g., RNA) in nanoparticle compositions. 100 μL of the diluted formulation in 1×PBS is added to 900 μL of a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and chloroform. After mixing, the absorbance spectrum of the solution is recorded, for example, between 230 nm and 330 nm on a DU 800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, Calif.). The concentration of polynucleotide in the nanoparticle composition can be calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the polynucleotide used in the composition and on the difference between the absorbance at a wavelength of, for example, 260 nm and the baseline value at a wavelength of, for example, 330 nm.

For nanoparticle compositions including an RNA, a QUANT-IT™ RIBOGREEN® RNA assay (Invitrogen Corporation Carlsbad, Calif.) can be used to evaluate the encapsulation of an RNA by the nanoparticle composition. The samples are diluted to a concentration of approximately 5 μg/mL in a TE buffer solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). 50 μL of the diluted samples are transferred to a polystyrene 96 well plate and either 50 μL of TE buffer or 50 μL of a 2% Triton X-100 solution is added to the wells. The plate is incubated at a temperature of 37° C. for 15 minutes. The RIBOGREEN® reagent is diluted 1:100 in TE buffer, and 100 μL of this solution is added to each well. The fluorescence intensity can be measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Wallac Victor 1420 Multilablel Counter; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) at an excitation wavelength of, for example, about 480 nm and an emission wavelength of, for example, about 520 nm. The fluorescence values of the reagent blank are subtracted from that of each of the samples and the percentage of free RNA is determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the intact sample (without addition of Triton X-100) by the fluorescence value of the disrupted sample (caused by the addition of Triton X-100).

Exemplary formulations of the nanoparticle compositions are presented in the Table 6 below. The term “Compound” refers to an ionizable lipid such as MC3, Compound II, or Compound VI. “Phospholipid” can be DSPC or DOPE. “PEG-lipid” can be PEG-DMG or Compound I.

**Example 16**

**Liver-Specific G6PC(−/−) Knockout Mouse Model for GSD-Ia**

To assess the ability of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA constructs encoding G6PC to express G6PC in vivo, mRNA encoding wild-type human G6PC or a mutated G6PC, was introduced into an animal model of GSD-Ia.

A genetic mouse model of GSD-Ia is the liver-specific G6PC knock-out mouse (L-G6PC(−/−)) mouse model (Mutel et al., J. Hepatol., 2011, 54(3):529-37, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). A mouse model for GSD-Ia has been generated that has a G6PC knocked-out completely, but these mice usually do not live longer than 3 months, making it impossible to evaluate long-term pathogenesis. By contrast, L-G6PC(−/−) mice were generated by tamoxifen-induced liver deletion of G6PC in adult mice. These mice are viable and exhibit normoglycemia when in the fed state. However, L-G6PC(−/−) mice cannot mobilize glycogen like wild-type mice, as they exhibit significantly elevated glycogen levels and much lower blood glucose levels (and are hypoglycemic) after a 6-hour fast. As time progresses, blood glucose levels gradually increase in these mice, possibly due to compensation from extrahepatic tissues. L-G6PC(−/−) mice develop enlarged livers and hepatic steatosis as a result of glycogen and triglycerides accumulation.

As a result, mRNA efficacy was evaluated by intravenously injecting L-G6pc(−/−) mice with either G6PC mRNA or control mRNA encoding GFP. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles for delivery into mice, e.g., in MC3 or other lipid formulations. Mice were fasted for 2.5 to 24 hours after mRNA injection. Glucose levels and body weight were measured at the time of injection (time 0) and at numerous time points after injection (e.g., at 2.5 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 24 hours after injection). Under some circumstances, at 24 hours after injection, mice were sacrificed, and mRNA levels, G6PC activity, glycogen levels, and G6P levels were measured in liver; tissue weight was measured (liver weight); and triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid, lactic acid, ALT were measured in serum.

**Engineered G6PC Variants to Increase Expression and Activity**

Mutations were introduced into wild-type human G6PC to improve the potency and/or stability of G6PC. Mutants were expressed in mice to determine whether they exhibited increased expression levels, increased G6Pase activity, and longer duration of action relative to wild-type G6PC. Two G6PC protein variants had been identified that exhibited increased protein expression levels and increased hepatic G6Pase activity relative to the wild-type protein when expressed in wild-type CD-1 mice. One mutant G6PC construct (Variant 1 (V1), SEQ ID NO:50) contains the S297G, S298C, V308L, V321I, and V340L substitutions. The second mutant G6PC construct (Variant 2 (V2), SEQ ID NO:51) contains the Q139R, I142K, Q247R, S298C, and V308L substitutions. Both variants (V1 and V2) showed higher protein expression and G6Pase activity than the wild-type G6PC (WT), while the Variant 2 (V2) exhibited higher protein expression and G6Pase activity than Variant 1 (see FIGS. 3A and 3B).

Bioinformatics tools were used to identify individual amino acid substitutions that exhibit enhanced expression and/or activity level in comparison to wild-type human G6PC sequence. The goal was to identify G6PC mutants likely to exhibit expression and/or activity that are the same or better relative to the Variant 2 G6PC mutant, but carry fewer mutations than the Variant 2 mutant. FIG. 4 shows the results of this bioinformatics analysis. Greater than 100 mammalian G6PC protein sequences were aligned and the consensus amino acids used in each position was compared with that used in human G6PC. Accordingly, a consensus score and reference score in each position was calculated (FIG. 4). Positions with larger difference in the consensus and reference scores were identified, and substitution of those individual amino acid in the human G6PC with the consensus amino acid (or more frequently used by non-human mammalian species) were made and tested to determine whether the substitution improves G6PC expression and/or activity.

The G6Pase activity of a subset of these individual G6PC substitutions (with greatest difference between the reference and consensus score, boxed in FIG. 4) was tested in Hela cells. Hela cells were grown in 6-well plates, and transfected with 1 μg of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding G6PC with a single amino acid substitution. G6Pase activity was tested 48 hours later in cell lysates, as described in Example 15. Specifically, cells were transfected with mRNA encoding human G6PC with a single substitution selected from Q139R (SEQ ID NO:53), I142K (SEQ ID NO:54), Q247R (SEQ ID NO:55), S297G (SEQ ID NO:56), S298C (SEQ ID NO:57), V308L (SEQ ID NO:58), V321I (SEQ ID NO:59), V321L (SEQ ID NO:60), V340L (SEQ ID NO:61), V332A (SEQ ID NO:62), and S298A (SEQ ID NO:65), or mRNA encoding human G6PC with multiple substitutions selected from Q139R/Q247R/S298C (SEQ ID NO:63) and Q247R/S298C (SEQ ID NO:64). G6Pase activity was compared to control cells transfected with eGFP, mRNA encoding wild-type human G6PC, or mRNA encoding Variant 2 G6PC. FIG. 5A shows that the S298C single substitution confers enhanced G6PC activity at a level that is similar to the Variant 2 G6PC mutant, which has five amino acid substitutions (Q139R, I142K, Q247R, S298C, and V308L). Thus, the S298C substitution is likely responsible for most of the enhanced activity observed for the Variant 2 G6PC mutant.

Additional mutations were made to G6PC to confirm that the S298C substitution is largely responsible for the enhanced activity and expression of the G6PC Variant 2 mutant. 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNAs encoding G6PC with an S298A substitution, an S298T substitution, Q247R and S298C substitutions, Q139R and Q247R substitutions were transfected into Hela cells as described above, and G6Pase activity was tested 48 hours later in cell lysates, as described in Example 15. G6Pase activity was compared to control cells transfected with eGFP, mRNA encoding wild-type human G6PC, or mRNA encoding Variant 1 G6PC. FIG. 5B confirms that the S298C substitution is most responsible for the enhanced activity of the Variant 2 G6PC mutant. Mutation of serine to cysteine is necessary for the enhanced stability and activity of G6PC, as the S298A and S298T substitutions exhibited low activity. In addition, combining S298C with Q139R or Q247R, other substitutions that exhibited higher G6Pase activity (see FIG. 5A), had moderate effect on the elevated G6Pase activity of the S298C substitution. Western blotting analysis was conducted, using Erp72 as a control to normalize the relative expression of human G6PC. FIG. 5C shows that mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution exhibited a high expression level and/or enhanced stability, near the expression level and/or enhanced stability of the Variant 2 mutant. The mRNA encoding G6PC with the Q139R and Q247R substitutions also exhibited a high expression level and/or stability, near the level observed for the Variant 2 mutant.

The activity and expression levels of the individual Q139R and Q247R G6PC substitutions were also examined as described above. FIG. 5D shows that G6PC with a Q139R or Q247R substitution exhibits greater G6Pase activity than wild-type G6PC, but less G6Pase activity than G6PC having an S298C substitution. FIG. 5E shows the specificity of this effect, as mutation of glutamine to alanine, rather than arginine, at amino acid position 139 or 247 of G6PC eliminated the enhanced G6PAse activity. FIG. 5F shows that G6PC with a Q139R or Q247R substitution exhibits greater expression than wild-type G6PC, but less expression than G6PC having an S298C substitution. FIG. 5G shows the specificity of this effect, as mutation of glutamine to alanine, rather than arginine, at amino acid position 139 or 247 of G6PC eliminated the enhanced expression. Therefore, in addition to S198C, the Q139R and Q247R substitution in human G6PC also appears to be beneficial in enhancing the protein expression and activity of human G6PC mRNA in mammalian cells.

**Example 18**

**Codon Optimization of mRNA Constructs**

The mRNAs encoding engineered G6PC variants were codon optimized using an algorithm to further improve the performance of the mRNAs to increase protein expression and activity.

The Variant 1 and Variant 2 mutants were each codon optimized. Five codon-optimized mRNA constructs were created for each of the Variable 1 and Variable 2 G6PC mutants (hG6PC V1 Co-1 (SEQ ID NO:72), hG6PC V1 Co-2 (SEQ ID NO:73), hG6PC V1 Co-3 (SEQ ID NO:74), hG6PC V1 Co-4 (SEQ ID NO:75), hG6PC V1 Co-5 (SEQ ID NO:76), hG6PC V2 Co-1 (SEQ ID NO:77), hG6PC V2 Co-2 (SEQ ID NO:78), hG6PC V2 Co-3 (SEQ ID NO:79), and hG6PC V2 Co-4 (SEQ ID NO:80), hG6PC V2 Co-5 (SEQ ID NO:81)). The codon optimized Variant 1 mRNA (hG6PC V1_Co-3; SEQ ID NO:74), codon optimized Variant 2 mRNA (hG6PC V2_Co-1; SEQ ID NO:77), or Variant 2 mRNA that was not codon optimized (SEQ ID NO:51) was injected in a single 1.0 mg/kg dose into wild-type mice via a single injection, and liver G6PC activity was measured at 48 or 96 hours post-injection, as described in Example 15 but using liver microsomes. Control mice were injected with mRNA encoding eGFP. The mRNAs were formulated in either MC3 lipid nanoparticles or in Compound II lipid nanoparticles for delivery into mice. FIGS. 6A and 6B show that G6PC expressed from both the codon optimized Variant 1 and Variant 2 mRNAs exhibited higher G6Pase activity compared to G6PC expressed from non-codon-optimized Variant 2 (V2) mRNA at both 48 and 96 hours post-injection, regardless of with lipid nanoparticles were used. * P<0.05 vs Variant 2 (V2) one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test, within each time point.

In addition, codon optimized Variant 1 mRNA (hG6PC V1 Co-3 (SEQ ID NO:74), hG6PC V1 Co-4 (SEQ ID NO:75), hG6PC V1 Co-5 (SEQ ID NO:76)), and codon optimized Variant 2 mRNA (hG6PC V2 Co-1 (SEQ ID NO:77), hG6PC V2 Co-3 (SEQ ID NO:79), and hG6PC V2 Co-5 (SEQ ID NO:81)), or Variant 1 and Variant 2 mRNA that was not codon optimized (SEQ ID NO:50 and SEQ ID NO: 51) was injected in a single 1.0 mg/kg dose into wild-type mice via a single injection (n=6/per construct), and liver G6PC activity was measured at 96 hours post-injection, as described in Example 15 but using liver microsomes. Control mice were injected with mRNA encoding eGFP. mRNAs were formulated in Compound II lipid nanoparticles for delivery into mice. FIG. 6C shows that injection of codon optimized mRNA encoding Variant 1 mutant proteins (hG6PC V2 CoV2-1) (Variant 2 or CoV2 as shown below) resulted in higher G6Pase activity generally relative to injection of non-codon optimized mRNA encoding the Variant 1 and Variant 2 mutants, although the hG6PC V2 CoV2-5 mRNA also exhibited higher G6PAse activity. FIG. 6D shows that injection of mRNA encoding the codon optimized hG6PC V1 CoV2-3 mRNA construct (Variant 1 or CoV1 as shown below) resulted in the highest G6PC protein expression. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. hG6PC V2 One-Way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Therefore, CoV2-1 (Variant 1) and CoV2-3 (Variant 2) were selected as templates for further improvement.

The mRNA encoding G6PC with an S298C substitution was codon optimized based on the codon-optimized Variant 1 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:74, producing S298C_CoV1, SEQ ID NO:66) or on the codon-optimized Variant 2 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:77, producing S298C_CoV2, SEQ ID NO:69). The mRNA encoding G6PC with Q139R, Q247R, and S298C substitutions was codon optimized based on the codon-optimized Variant 1 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:74, producing Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV1, SEQ ID NO:67) or on the codon-optimized Variant 2 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:77, producing Q139R/Q247R/S298C/CoV2, SEQ ID NO:70). The mRNA encoding G6PC with Q139R, I142K, Q247R, S297G, S298C, V308L, V321I, and V340L substitutions was codon optimized based on the codon-optimized Variant 1 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:74, producing M8_CoV1, SEQ ID NO:68) or on the codon-optimized Variant 2 mRNA sequence (the substitution was introduced into SEQ ID NO:77, producing M8_CoV2, SEQ ID NO:71).

**Example 19**

**In Vivo Expression and Activity of an mRNA-Encoded G6PC Variants in Wild-Type Mice**

To test the ability of codon-optimized and non-codon-optimized 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA constructs to express G6PC in vivo, and to test the activity of the G6PC, a single 1.0 mg/kg dose of each mRNA construct was IV administered to wild-type CD-1 mice via tail vein injection. Non-codon-optimized mRNA constructs encoding G6PC with an S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:57), and S298A mutation (SEQ ID NO:65), Q139R/Q247R/S298C mutations (SEQ ID NO:63), or Q247R/S298C mutations (SEQ ID NO:64); or codon-optimized mRNA constructs, including S298C_CoV1 (SEQ ID NO:66), S298C_CoV2 (SEQ ID NO:69), Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV1 (SEQ ID NO:67), Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV2 (SEQ ID NO:70), M8_CoV1 (SEQ ID NO:68), and M8_CoV2 (SEQ ID NO:71). The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II) for delivery into mice. Control mice were administered eGFP or mRNA encoding wild-type human G6PC. Four mice were injected per mRNA construct. Animals were sacrificed 96 hours after injection, and 0.5 g of liver was removed from each animal and homogenized in 5 ml of saline to prepare liver microsomes. G6PC protein expression was determined by capillary electrophoresis or Western blot, and G6Pase activity was determined, using the liver microsomes.

FIG. 7A shows that the mRNA constructs that were codon optimized based on the codon-optimized Variant 1 G6PC mutant exhibited higher G6Pase activity levels compared to those constructs that were codon optimized based on the Variant 2 G6PC mutant or those constructs that were not codon optimized. The G6PC proteins with the S298C, Q139R/Q247R/S298C, or the M8 substitutions exhibited similar G6Pase levels. FIG. 7B shows that the mRNA constructs that were codon optimized based on the codon-optimized Variant 1 G6PC mutant exhibited higher G6PC expression levels compared to those constructs that were codon optimized based on the Variant 2 G6PC mutant or those constructs that were not codon optimized. Based on this data, the S298C-CoV1 was selected for further pharmacology study in Gsd1a disease models in mice.

**Assessing Duration of Action of mRNA-Encoded G6PC in a Liver-Specific Knockout Mouse Model—Single Dose Studies**

To test the efficacy and duration of action of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding a codon-optimized human G6PC S298C variant (S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66) in vivo, a single 0.5 mg/kg dose or 1.0 mg/kg dose of mRNA was IV administered to L-G6PC(−/−) mice (n=8-10 mice per dose) via tail vein injection. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into mice. As controls, mRNA encoding eGFP (at 1 mg/kg) was injected into L-G6PC(−/−) mice (n=9 mice), and PBS was injected into wild-type mice (n=8 mice). Blood glucose levels were monitored at 2.5 hours and 6 hours fasting at 3 days prior to mRNA injection (−3 days), and on each of 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, and 15 days post-injection.

FIGS. 8A-8F show that L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were administered mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution exhibited higher blood glucose levels than mice injected with the eGFP control after being fasted for 2.5 hours and for 6 hours for up to 11 days post-injection. Thus, injection of G6PC mRNA resulted in fasting blood glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were higher than eGFP control and closer to normal levels, although the levels were not as high as the glucose levels observed in wild-type mice. This effect was observed when the mRNA was injected at 0.5 mg/kg or at 1 mg/kg dose. By day 15 (see FIG. 8F), mRNA injected mice no longer exhibited higher blood glucose levels relative to eGFP control mice. As expected, control wild-type mice injected with PBS maintained high blood glucose levels when fasted, and all mice (wild-type control and L-G6PC(−/−)) had higher blood glucose levels when fed. **P<0.01 vs. GFP one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison. ****P<0.0001 vs. GFP one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison.

FIGS. 8G-8H show the time course effect of administration of the 0.5 mg/kg dose (FIG. 8G) and the 1 mg/kg dose (FIG. 8H). In both figures, the therapeutic threshold of 70 mg/dL is indicated by a solid bar.

FIGS. 9A-9C show the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution on fasting glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice, as compared to fasting glucose levels prior to mRNA injection. FIG. 9A shows that fasting glucose were elevated significantly through 11 days post-injection when mRNA was administered at 1 mg/kg. FIG. 9B shows that fasting glucose were elevated significantly through 8 days post-injection when mRNA was administered at 0.5 mg/kg. FIG. 9C shows that administering eGFP to L-G6PC(−/−) mice did not result in elevated fasting glucose levels, as expected for this control. **P<0.01 vs. pre-treatment Paired t-test. ***P<0.001 vs. pre-treatment Paired t-test. ****P<0.0001 vs. pre-treatment Paired t-test.

**Assessing Dose Response of mRNA Encoding G6PC in a Liver-Specific Knockout Mouse Model**

To test the dose response of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding a codon-optimized human G6PC S298C variant (S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66) in vivo, a single 0.2 mg/kg dose, 0.5 mg/kg dose or 1.0 mg/kg dose of mRNA was IV administered to L-G6PC(−/−) mice via tail vein injection. Seven to eight mice were injected per mRNA construct. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into mice. As controls, mRNA encoding eGFP (at 1 mg/kg) was injected into L-G6PC(−/−) mice (n=8 mice), and PBS was injected into wild-type mice (n=8 mice). Fasting glucose levels were measured in mice fasted for 2.5 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours, and compared to glucose levels in mice that were fed. At 24 hours post-injection, liver samples were collected, and liver weight and appearance was recorded, and the levels of glycogen, G-6-phosphate, triglyceride, G6PC protein expression, G6PC activity, hG6PC mRNA, and IHC were measured in the samples. At 24 hours post-injection, plasma was collected from the mice, and the liver enzyme ALT, the lipids TG and cholesterol, lactate, and hG6PC mRNA levels were measured in the plasma.

FIG. 10A shows that G6PC mRNA (SEQ ID NO:66) injected at each of the 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg doses increased glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice at 2.5 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours of fasting relative to the glucose levels in control mice injected with eGFP mRNA. At 2.5 hours fasting, a single mRNA dose of 1 mg/kg resulted in glucose levels that were near the glucose levels observed in wild-type control mice injected with PBS. However, single doses of mRNA at 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg resulted in similar elevated levels of glucose at 6 hours and 24 hours fasting that were near the levels see in fasted wild-type control mice. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. GFP Two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons. FIG. 10B shows that injection of 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg of the G6PC mRNA resulted in fasting blood glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) that were above the therapeutic threshold of 70 mg/dL (indicated by a solid bar in FIG. 10B).

FIG. 10C shows the effects of injecting single 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg doses of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution on fasting glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice, as compared to fasting glucose levels prior to mRNA injection. Injecting each dose results in an increase in blood glucose levels post-injection, and injection of mRNA at a 1 mg/kg dose results in the largest increase in glucose. By contrast, injecting PBS in control wild-type mice, and injecting mRNA encoding GFP in L-G6PC(−/−) mice did not increase blood glucose levels. **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001 vs. pre-treatment Paired t-test.

FIGS. 11A-11B show the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the

S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on liver weight in L-G6PC(−/−) mice, both in the total weight (in grams) of the livers (FIG. 11A) and as the weight of the liver as a percentage of total body weight (FIG. 11B). As expected, control L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with mRNA encoding GFP had substantially larger livers compared to wild-type control mice injected with PBS. Injection of any single 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg dose of mRNA encoding the human G6PC protein resulted in a significant decrease in liver weight relative to the L-G6PC(−/−) mice treated with the control eGFP mRNA. Injecting the 1 mg/kg dose of mRNA resulted in the largest decrease in liver size, and the livers of these mice were similar in weight to those of the wild-type control mice. ****P<0.0001 vs. GFP One-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons.

FIG. 12 shows representative liver images from wild-type mice or L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution at 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg, or with mRNA encoding GFP. As expected, the liver from L-G6PC(−/−) mice were enlarged and had a whitish and pale appearance compared to the liver in wild-type mice. Injection with mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) resulted in significant normalization of the liver appearance in L-G6PC(−/−) mice.

FIG. 13A shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on hepatic glucose-6 phosphate (G6P), the endogenous substrate of G6Pase. As expected, the hepatic G6P content from L-G6PC(−/−) mice is significantly elevated in comparison with wild-type mice (compare L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with eGFP mRNA and wild-type mice injected with PBS). Injection of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution led to a significant and dose-dependent decrease in hepatic G6P content. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. eGFP, one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons.

FIG. 13B shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on hepatic glycogen levels. The hepatic glycogen content from L-G6PC(−/−) mice is significantly elevated in comparison with wild-type mice (compare L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with eGFP mRNA and wild-type mice injected with PBS). Injection of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution led to a significant decrease in hepatic glycogen content.

FIG. 13C shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on serum triglyceride levels. The serum triglyceride level from L-G6PC(−/−) mice is significantly elevated in comparison with wild-type mice (compare L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with eGFP mRNA and wild-type mice injected with PBS). Injection of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution led to a significant decrease in serum triglyceride level.

FIG. 13D shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on serum ALT (liver enzyme) levels. The serum ALT level from L-G6PC(−/−) mice is significantly elevated in comparison with wild-type mice (compare L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with eGFP mRNA and wild-type mice injected with PBS). Injection of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution led to a significant decrease in serum ALT level.

FIG. 13E shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on serum lactate levels in 3-4 month old mice. FIG. 13F shows the effects of injecting mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) on liver lactate levels in 3-4 month old mice.

FIGS. 14A-14C show hepatic G6Pase activity (FIG. 14A) and G6PC protein expression (FIGS. 14B-C) in L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) at 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg, or with mRNA encoding GFP. As expected, the L-G6PC(−/−) mice injected with mRNA encoding GFP had a very low hepatic G-6-phosphatase activity in comparison with the wild-type mice (injected with PBS). Injection with mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hepatic G-6-Phosphatase activity (FIG. 14A). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001 vs. GFP, one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons. Injection with mRNA encoding the G6PC with the S298C substitution also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hepatic G6PC protein expression (FIGS. 14B-C; as analyzed by western blot and quantitated using the imaging instrument Odyssey CLx and accompanying applications (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebr.)). **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 vs. eGFP, one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons.

**Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis of mRNA-Encoded G6PC Variants in Wild-Type Mice**

A pharmacokinetic analysis of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNAs encoding human G6PC variants was conducted in wild-type CD-1 mice. Mice were administered a single 1 mg/kg dose of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66) or mRNA encoding G6PC with S298C/Q139R/Q247R substitutions (Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:67) via tail vein injection. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into mice. Control mice were administered eGFP. Liver samples were isolated at 6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days following injection, as described. mRNA levels were analyzed in the samples using RT-PCR and normalized by ActB (β-actin) mRNA levels. G6PC protein expression levels and G6PC activity levels were also assayed in the liver samples at each time point, as described above.

FIG. 15A shows the amount of mRNA (pg of G6PC mRNA per 100 ng of total RNA) in the livers of injected animals over time. The amount of each of the mRNAs encoding the G6PC variants (S298C_CoV1 and Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV1) reduced rapidly over 24 hours, and were no longer detectable by 72 hours post-injection. FIGS. 15B and 15C show the protein expression levels of the mRNA-expressed G6PC S298C and G6PC Q139R/Q247R/S298C proteins over time, and FIG. 15D compares the time courses of protein expression for these G6PC variants. G6PC S298C protein levels decrease to lower levels at an earlier time (e.g., day 7) following mRNA injection than G6PC Q139R/Q247R/S298C protein levels, although both proteins have similar low levels of expression by 14 days (336 hours) post-injection. FIG. 15E shows that the G6PC S298C protein exhibited a significantly lower area under the curve (AUC) value based on protein expression than the G6PC Q139R/Q247R/S298C protein. **P<0.01. FIG. 15F shows that the G6Pase activity of mRNA-expressed G6PC S298C protein was slightly but consistently lower than the G6Pase activity of mRNA-expressed G6PC Q139R/Q247R/S298C protein over the course of 14 days following mRNA injection. FIG. 15G shows that the G6PC S298C protein exhibited a significantly lower area under the curve (AUC) value based on protein activity than the G6PC Q139R/Q247R/S298C protein. **P<0.01.

Mice were administered a single 1 mg/kg dose of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (hG6PC S298C_CoV1 (SEQ ID NO:66) or G6PC_S298C_Astart_3XmiR142 (SEQ ID NO:215)) via tail vein injection. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into the mice. Control mice were administered eGFP. Liver samples were isolated 24 hours following injection. G6PC protein expression levels and G6PC activity levels were assayed in the liver samples, as described above. FIGS. 15H-15I show the G6PC protein expression levels (FIG. 15H) and G6Pase activity (FIG. 15I) following administration of each of the mRNAs.

**Assessing Sustained Efficacy of mRNA-Encoded G6PC in a Liver-Specific Knockout Mouse Model—Repeat Dose Studies**

L-G6PC(−/−) mice received five consecutive intravenous injections of 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66), 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding G6PC with S298C/Q139R/Q247R substitutions (Q139R/Q247R/S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:67), or eGFP mRNA, each at doses of 0.5 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg and at an interval of 11 to 14 days over the course of 51 days. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into the mice. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice receiving PBS were used as control. The fed and fasting glucose levels (2.5 hours post-fasting) were measured every 3-4 days after each injection. The baseline fed and fasting glucose levels (2.5 hours post-fasting) were also measured 5 days before injecting the mRNAs. After the last (5th) injection, the mice were fasted and the fasting glucose levels were monitored at 2.5, 6, and 24 hours post-fasting. At the end of the in-life study, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for blood and tissue collections. The livers were harvested, weighed, and photographed. Liver pieces were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis or fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. The plasma samples were also collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis.

FIG. 16 shows that L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were administered multiple doses of 0.25 mg/kg of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (“single”) or mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C/Q139R/Q247R substitutions (“triple”) exhibited higher blood glucose levels than mice injected with the eGFP control after being fasted for 2.5 hours. Injection of each of five doses of both of the G6PC mRNAs resulted in blood glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were above the therapeutic threshold of 70 mg/dL (indicated by a solid bar in FIG. 16). As expected, control wild-type mice injected with PBS had high blood glucose levels when fasted. FIG. 17 shows that injection of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution (“single”) or mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C/Q139R/Q247R substitutions (“triple”) resulted in a significant decrease in liver weight relative to the L-G6PC(−/−) control mice. Liver weight was measured in mice receiving mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg, after the 5th dose.

**Assessing Action of mRNA-Encoded G6PC in Different Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations**

To test the efficacy of different lipid nanoparticle formulations, 1-methyl-pseudouridine modified mRNA encoding the G6PC S298C variant (G6PC_S298C_Astart; SEQ ID NO:214) was IV administered to L-G6PC(−/−) mice (n=8 or 9 mice per group) in a single 1.0 mg/kg dose of mRNA via tail vein injection. The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG or Compound II/Compound I) for delivery into the mice. As controls, mRNA encoding eGFP (at 1 mg/kg) was injected into L-G6PC(−/−) mice (Compound II/Compound I), and Tris-Sucrose buffer was injected into wild-type mice. Blood glucose levels were monitored at 2.5 hours fasting on each of days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-injection.

FIG. 18 shows that L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were administered mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution in either Compound II/PEG-DMG or Compound II/Compound I lipid nanoparticles exhibited higher blood glucose levels than mice injected with the eGFP control after being fasted for 2.5 hours. Injection of the G6PC mRNA in both lipid nanoparticles resulted in blood glucose levels in L-G6PC(−/−) mice that were above the therapeutic threshold of 70 mg/dL (indicated by a solid bar in FIG. 18).

**In Vivo Expression of miRNA-Targeted mRNA-Encoded G6Pase in Wild-Type Mice**

The impact of miRNA-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR of 1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA encoding a human G6PC variant was tested in wild-type CD-1 mice. Mice were administered a single 1 mg/kg dose of mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution and lacking miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR (hG6PC S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66) or mRNA encoding G6PC with the S298C substitution and having three miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR (G6PC_S298C_Astart_3XmiR142; SEQ ID NO:215). The mRNA was formulated in lipid nanoparticles (Compound II/PEG-DMG) for delivery into mice. Control mice were administered eGFP. Liver and spleen samples were isolated 24 hours following injection, as described. G6PC protein expression levels were assayed in the liver and spleen samples as described above.

FIG. 19A shows the liver protein expression levels of the mRNA-expressed G6PC S298C with (miR142; SEQ ID NO:215) and without (no miR; SEQ ID NO:66) miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR. mRNA encoding G6PC S298C with miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR (SEQ ID NO:215) was as effective as mRNA encoding G6PC S298C without miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR (SEQ ID NO:66) in hepatic expression of G6Pase protein. FIG. 19B shows the spleen protein expression levels of the mRNA-expressed G6PC S298C with (miR142; SEQ ID NO:215) and without (no miR; SEQ ID NO:66) miR-142 target sites in the 3′ UTR. Neither mRNA encoding G6PC S298C resulted in G6Pase protein expression in the spleen.

**In Vitro Expression of mRNA-Encoded G6Pase in Kidney Proximal Tubule Segment (TKPTS) Cells**

To test the delivery to kidney cells of LNP-formulated 1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA encoding a hG6PC variant, various transfection methods were tested in TKPTS cells. Mouse TKPTS cells were mock-transfected (no mRNA, negative control) or transfected with mRNA encoding hG6PC having an S298C substitution (hG6PC S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66). mRNAs were formulated in Compound II/PEG-DMG or Compound II/Compound I LNPs, or were transfected using Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific). At 4 and 24 hours post-transfection, cells were monitored for LNP uptake, hG6PC mRNA levels, and hG6Pase expression levels. LNPs were labeled with rhodamine to track accumulation in the cells. G6PC expression levels were assayed as described above.

FIG. 20A shows the LNP uptake in TKPTS cells at the indicated timepoints post-transfection of the cells with mRNA encoding hG6PC with a S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; left) or 5% human serum (right); negative control represents non-transfected cells. Compound II/PEG-DMG and Compound II/Compound I LNPs displayed superior LNP uptake compared to MessengerMAX uptake. FIG. 20B shows the eGFP expression in TKPTS cells at the indicated timepoints post-transfection of the cells with mRNA encoding hG6PC with a S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) in the presence of 10% FBS (left) or 5% human serum (right). FIG. 20C shows hG6PC expression in TKPTS cells at the indicated timepoints post-transfection of the cells with mRNA encoding hG6PC with a S298C substitution (SEQ ID NO:66) in the presence of 10% FBS (left) or 5% human serum (right). FIG. 20D shows the percentage of cells expressing transfected mRNA in TKPTS cells at the indicated timepoints post-transfection of the cells with mRNA encoding hG6PC with a S298C substitution in the presence of 10% FBS (left) or 5% human serum (right).

**In Vivo Expression of mRNA-Encoded G6Pase in Kidneys**

The delivery to kidneys of LNP-formulated 1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified hG6PC mRNA was tested in K.G6PC−/− mice. K.G6PC−/− mice were administered 1 mg/kg of Compound II/PEG-DMG LNPs comprising mRNA encoding eGFP or hG6PC having a S298C substitution (hG6PC S298C_CoV1; SEQ ID NO:66) via the intravenous route. As a control, wild-type mice were administered PBS intravenously. Six or 24 hours post-administration, mice were sacrificed and protein expression and enzymatic activity were assayed as described above.

FIG. 21A shows G6Pase expression, as a percentage of the level in wild-type mice, in wild-type mice administered PBS or K.G6PC−/− mice administered eGFP mRNA or hG6PC mRNA (SEQ ID NO:66). FIG. 21B shows G6Pase activity in wild-type mice administered PBS or K.G6PC −/− mice administered eGFP mRNA or hG6PC mRNA. G6Pase expression was determined by western blot. K.G6PC−/− mice had ˜50% G6Pase expression and activity in kidneys compared to that of wild type mice.
