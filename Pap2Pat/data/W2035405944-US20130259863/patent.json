                        "Hemostasis relies on the complex coagulation cascade, wherein a series of events mediated by blood clotting factors leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Factor X (FX) activation is the central event of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade. The extrinsic pathway has been proposed as the primary activator of the coagulation cascade (Mackman et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Case. Biol., 27, 1687-1693 (2007)). Circulating Tissue Factor (TF) and activated Factor VII (FVIIa) interact to form the \u201cextrinsic complex,\u201d which mediates activation of FX. The coagulation cascade is amplified by the intrinsic pathway, during which successive activation of factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII results in formation of the \u201cintrinsic\u201d FIXa-FVIIIa complex that also mediates FX activation. Activated FX promotes thrombin formation, which is required for the body to create fibrin and effectively curb bleeding.",
                        "Severe bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, result from disruption of the blood coagulation cascade. Hemophilia A, the most common type of hemophilia, stems from a deficiency in factor VIII, while hemophilia B is associated with deficiencies in Factor IX (FIX). Hemophilia C is caused by a deficiency in Factor XI (FXI) (Cawthern et al., Blood, 91(12), 4581-4592 (1998)). There is currently no cure for hemophilia and other clotting diseases. Factor replacement therapy is the most common treatment for blood coagulation disorders. However, blood clotting factors typically are cleared from the bloodstream shortly after administration. To be effective, a patient must receive frequent intravenous infusions of plasma-derived or recombinant factor concentrates, which is uncomfortable, requires clinical settings, is expensive, and is time consuming. In addition, therapeutic efficacy of factor replacement therapy can diminish drastically upon formation of inhibitory antibodies. Approximately 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A develop inhibitory antibodies that neutralize Factor VIII (FVIII) (Peerlinck and Hermans, Haemophilia, 12, 579-590 (2006)). Few therapeutic options exist for patients with anti-Factor antibodies.",
                        "Thus, there exists a need in the art for compositions and methods for treating blood coagulation disorders. The invention provides such compositions and methods."

                        "The invention provides peptides that bind Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-1 and, in some instances, block the inhibitory activity of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-1 (herein referred to as TFPI) within the blood coagulation cascade. Upon vascular injury, Tissue Factor (TF) complexes with Factor Vlla to form the \u201cextrinsic complex\u201d or \u201cextrinsic tenase complex,\u201d which activates Factors IX and X (FIG. 1). TFPI is the main natural regulator of TF/FVIIa extrinsic complex activity and by extension, plays a role in controlling thrombin generation (Panteleev et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 249, 2016-2031 (2002)). TFPI is a 43 kDa serine protease inhibitor comprising three Kunitz-type inhibitory domains (FIG. 2). Kunitz domain 1 of TFPI binds FVIIa and Kunitz domain 2 binds FXa, enabling the inhibitor to form a quaternary FXa-TFPI-FVIIa-TF complex that blocks activity of the TF/FVIIa extrinsic complex (FIG. 3). TFPI binding of FXa also downregulates the common pathway of the coagulation cascade, during which FXa converts prothrombin to thrombin (Audu et al., Anesth. Analg., 103(4), 841-845 (2006)). The invention provides, e.g., TFPI-inhibitory peptides that block TFPI's inhibitory action on the blood coagulation cascade, thereby enhancing thrombin formation.",
                        "The amino acid sequences of several TFPI-binding peptides are provided herein. Conventional amino acids are identified according to their standard, one-letter or three-letter codes, as set forth in Table 1.",
                        "Examples of non-conventional amino acids and additional peptide building blocks are identified according to a three-letter code (with the exception of Ttds and Dopa, which are common four-letter abbreviations) found in Table 2. Additional building blocks designated by three-, four- or seven-number/letter designations or abbreviations also are listed in Table 2. The structures of some building blocks are depicted with an exemplary reagent for introducing the building block into a peptide (e.g., the structure provided for 2-naphthyl sulfonyl comprises a chloride).",
                        "The amino acid sequences of the peptides provided herein are depicted in typical peptide sequence format, as would be understood by the ordinary skilled artisan. For example, the three-letter code or one-letter code of a conventional amino acid, or the three-, four-, or seven-number/letter code additional building blocks, indicates the presence of the amino acid or building block in a specified position within the peptide sequence. The code for each non-conventional amino acid or building block is connected to the code for the next and/or previous amino acid or building block in the sequence by a hyphen. Adjacent amino acids are connected by a chemical bond (typically an amide bond). The formation of the chemical bond removes a hydroxyl group from the 1-carboxyl group of the amino acid when it is located to the left of the adjacent amino acid (e.g., Hle-adjacent amino acid), and removes a hydrogen from the amino group of the amino acid when it is located on the right of the adjacent amino acid (e.g., adjacent amino acid-Hle). It is understood that both modifications can apply to the same amino acid and apply to adjacent conventional amino acids present in amino acid sequences without hyphens explicitly illustrated. Where an amino acid contains more than one amino and/or carboxy group in the amino acid side chain, the 2- or 3-amino group and/or the 1-carboxy group generally are used for the formation of peptide bonds. For non-conventional amino acids, a 3-letter code was used where the first letter indicates the stereochemistry of the C-\u03b1-atom. For example, a capital first letter indicates that the L-form of the amino acid is present in the peptide sequence, while a lower case first letter indicating that the D-form of the correspondent amino acid is present in the peptide sequence. When one-letter code is used, a lower case letter represents a D-amino acid, while an upper case letter represents an L-amino acid. Unless indicated to the contrary, the amino acid sequences are presented herein in N- to C-terminus direction.",
                        "The C-termini of several TFPI-binding peptide sequences described herein are explicitly illustrated by inclusion of an OH, NH2, or an abbreviation for a specific terminating amine linked to the C-terminal amino acid code via a hyphen. The N-termini of several peptides described herein are explicitly illustrated by inclusion of a hydrogen (for a free N-terminus), or an abbreviation for a specific terminating carboxylic acid or other chemical group linked to the N-terminal amino acid code via a hyphen.",

Non-limiting examples include modified amino acids incorporating thioamides, ureas, thioureas, acylhydrazides, esters, olefines, sulfonamides, phosphoric acid amides, ketones, alcohols, boronic acid amides, benzodiazepines and other aromatic or non-aromatic heterocycles (see Estiarte et al., Burgers Medicinal Chemistry, 6th edition, Volume 1, Part 4, John Wiley & Sons, New York (2002)).

The retro-modified peptide comprises the same amino acid chirality as the reference peptide. An \u201cinverso-modified\u201d peptide is a peptide of the invention comprising amino acid residues assembled in the same direction as a reference peptide, but the chirality of the amino acids is inverted. Thus, where the reference peptide comprises L-amino acids, the \u201cinverso-modified\u201d peptide comprises D-amino acids, and vice versa. Inverso-modified peptides comprise CO\u2014NH peptide bonds. A \u201cretro-inverso modified\u201d peptide refers to a peptide comprising amino acid residues assembled in the opposite direction and which have inverted chirality. A retro-inverso analogue has reversed termini and reversed direction of peptide bonds (i.e., NH\u2014CO), while approximately maintaining the side chain topology found in the reference peptide. Retro-inverso peptidomimetics are made using standard methods, including the methods described in Meziere et al, J. Immunol., 159, 3230-3237 (1997), incorporated herein by reference. Partial retro-inverso peptides are peptides in which only part of the amino acid sequence is reversed and replaced with enantiomeric amino acid residues.",
                        "TFPI-binding peptides of the invention (including TFPI inhibitor peptides) are made in a variety of ways. In one aspect, the peptides are synthesized by solid phase synthesis techniques including those described in Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, 2149 (1963); Davis et al., Biochem. Intl., 10, 394-414 (1985); Larsen et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115, 6247 (1993); Smith et al., J. Peptide Protein Res., 44, 183 (1994); O'Donnell et al., J. Am. Chem.

Alternatively, the TFPI-binding peptide (e.g., the TFPI-inhibitory peptide) is expressed recombinantly by introducing a nucleic acid encoding a TFPI-binding peptide (e.g., a TFPI-inhibitory peptide) into host cells, which are cultured to express the peptide. Such peptides are purified from the cell culture using standard protein purification techniques.",
                        "The invention also encompasses a nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TFPI-inhibitory peptide of the invention. Methods of preparing DNA and/or RNA molecules are well known in the art. In one aspect, a DNA/RNA molecule encoding a peptide provided herein is generated using chemical synthesis techniques and/or using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If desired, a TFPI-inhibitory peptide coding sequence is incorporated into an expression vector. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any of a number of expression vectors known in the art are suitable in the context of the invention, such as, but not limited to, plasmids, plasmid-liposome complexes, and viral vectors. Any of these expression vectors are prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques described in, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y. (1994). Optionally, the nucleic acid is operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, such as a promoter, activator, enhancer, cap signal, polyadenylation signal, or other signal involved with the control of transcription or translation.",

In this regard, the peptide is formulated with a physiologically-acceptable (i.e., pharmacologically-acceptable) carrier, buffer, excipient, or diluent, as described further herein. Optionally, the peptide is in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt, which is encompassed by the invention. \u201cPhysiologically acceptable salts\u201d means any salts that are pharmaceutically acceptable. Some examples of appropriate salts include acetate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, citrate, tartrate, glycolate, and oxalate. If desired, the composition comprises one or more additional pharmaceutically-effective agents.",
                        "The peptide provided herein optionally inhibits at least one TFPI-1 (e.g., TFPI-1\u03b1 or TFPI-1\u03b2) activity such as, but not limited to, an activity that downregulates the blood coagulation cascade. Without being bound by any specific mechanism of action, a proposed mechanism of inhibition may involve preventing formation of the quaternary TF-FVIIA-FXA-TFPI complex. The peptide may inhibit binding (competitively or allosterically) of TFPI to FXa (e.g., inhibit binding of TFPI Kunitz domain 2 to Factor Xa or interrupt binding of TFPI Kunitz domain 1 to an exosite of Factor Xa), the TF/FVIIa complex (e.g., inhibit binding of TFPI Kunitz domain 1 to the TF/FVIIa complex), TF alone, and/or FVIIa alone. With TFPI activity diminished, TF and FVIIa are free to activate FX which, in turn, enhances conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Surprisingly, in one embodiment, the peptide of the invention that binds Kunitz domain 1 interferes with TFPI-mediated inhibition of FXa. Thus, the invention provides a method of, e.g., inhibiting TFPI-mediated downregulation of the extrinsic and/or common pathway of the coagulation cascade and/or enhancing FXa-mediated conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, by administering to a subject a peptide described herein that binds Kunitz domain 1.",
                        "In one aspect, the peptide of the invention exhibits TFPI antagonistic activity in model and/or plasmatic systems. An exemplary model system for determining TFPI-inhibitory activity is the extrinsic tenase assay, which tests the ability of candidate peptides to restore extrinsic complex-mediated FX activation in the presence of TFPI (which is a natural inhibitor of the FX activation reaction) (see, e.g., Lindhout et al., Thromb. Haemost., 74, 910-915 (1995)). Another model system for characterizing TFPI-inhibitory activity is the FXa inhibition assay, wherein FXa activity is measured in the presence of TFPI (see Sprecher et al., PNAS, 91, 3353-3357 (1994)). The extrinsic tenase assay and the FXa inhibition assay are further described in Example 3. Optionally, the peptide of the invention enhances FX activation in the presence of TFPI with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22124M, less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22125M, less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22126M, or less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22127M.",
                        "In one aspect, TFPI-antagonist activity is characterized in a plasma-based assay. Thrombin formation is triggered in plasma substantially lacking FVIII or FIX activity (e.g., the residual coagulation factor activity is lower than 1%) in the presence of a candidate peptide. Thrombin formation can be detected using a fluorogenic or chromogenic substrate, as described in Example 4. A system for measuring thrombin activity is provided by Thrombinoscope BV (Maastricht, The Netherlands). Prothrombin conversion is measured using, e.g., a Thrombograph\u2122 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), and the resulting data is compiled into a Calibrated Automatic Thrombogram generated by Thrombinoscope\u2122 software available from Thrombinoscope BV. In certain embodiments, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide increases the amount of peak thrombin generated during the assay and/or decreases the time required to achieve peak thrombin formation. For example, the peptide improves TFPI-regulated thrombin generation in the absence of FVIII (e.g., in FVIII-depleted plasma) to at least 1% of the level of TFPI-dependent thrombin generation in normal plasma. Generally, normal (unafflicted) plasma contains about 0.5 U/mL to about 2 U/mL Factor VIII. Accordingly, in some instances, a TFPI-inhibitor peptide will enhance thrombin formation in the absence of FVIII to at least about 1% of that observed in the presence of 0.5 U/mL to 2 U/mL FVIII. In further embodiments, the peptide enhances thrombin formation in the absence of Factor VIII to at least about 2%, at least about 3%, at least about 5%, at least about 7%, or at least about 10% of the level of thrombin formation in normal plasma, i.e., in the presence of physiological levels of Factor VIII. In various aspects, the peptide is administered to an animal model of thrombin deficiency or hemophilia to characterize TFPI inhibitory activity in vivo. Such in vivo models are known in the art and include for example, mice administered anti-FVIII antibodies to induce hemophilia A (Tranholm et al., Blood, 102, 3615-3620 (2003)); coagulation factor knock-out models such as, but not limited to, FVIII knock-out mice (Bi et al., Nat. Genet., 10(1), 119-121 (1995)) and FIX knock-out mice (Wang et al., PNAS, 94(21), 11563-66 (1997)); induced hemophilia-A in rabbits (Shen et al., Blood, 42(4), 509-521 (1973)); and Chapel Hill HA dogs (Lozier et al., PNAS, 99, 12991-12996 (2002)).",
                        "Various peptides bind TFPI from any source including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cow, horse, pig, guinea pig, and primate. In one embodiment, the peptide binds human TFPI. Optionally, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide binds TFPI from more than one species (i.e., the peptide is cross-reactive among multiple species). In certain aspects, the peptide binds TFPI with a dissociation constant (KD) of less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22124M, less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22125M, less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22126M, or less than or equal to 1\u00d710\u22127 M. Affinity may be determined using, for example and without limitation, any one, two, or more of a variety of techniques, such as affinity ELISA assay, a competitive ELISA assay, and/or surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore\u2122) assay. When characterized using a competitive (IC50) ELISA assay, the peptide of the invention optionally demonstrates an IC50 of less than or equal to about 50,000 nM. For example, the peptide demonstrates an IC50 of less than or equal to about 10,000 nM, such as an IC50 of less than or equal to about 5,000 nM, less than or equal to about 1,000 nM, or less than or equal to about 500 nM. In one aspect, the peptide demonstrates an IC50 of less than or equal to about 250 nM, less than or equal to about 100 nM, less than or equal to about 50 nM, or less than or equal to about 10 nM. Exemplary peptides and their IC50 values are provided in FIGS. 32A-32AM, 33, 34A-34J, 35, 36A-36Q, 37, 38A-38B, and 39; in some instances, the peptides are classified into Groups A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (see Table 4 in Example 1) based on their IC50 values. In various aspects, the invention provides peptides falling within Groups A, B, C, D, E, F, and/or G as defined in Table 4. Affinity may also be determined by a kinetic method or an equilibrium/solution method. Such methods are described in further detail herein or known in the art.",
                        "Another suitable assay for characterizing the inventive peptides is a koff assay, which examines a peptide's release from TFPI. The koff assay result is not the dissociation rate constant, but a percentage of competitor peptide blocked from TFPI binding by a test peptide after an incubation period with TFPI. An exemplary koff assay includes the following steps: 1) incubation of a TFPI-coated microtiter plate with an amount of test peptide resulting in approximately 90% TFPI occupation; 2) removal of unbound test peptide; 3) addition of a biotinylated tracer (i.e., competitor) peptide that competes with the test peptide for binding to TFPI; 4) incubation for a period of time during which binding sites released by the test peptide is occupied by the tracer; 5) removal of unbound tracer and test peptide; and 6) detection of bound tracer by a chromogenic reaction using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The resulting signal is indicative of binding sites freed by the test peptide. A test peptide that does not dissociate from TFPI during the incubation period yields a weaker signal compared to an analyte that dissociates completely.",
                        "As with all binding agents and binding assays, one of skill in the art recognizes that the various moieties to which a binding agent should not detectably bind in order to be biologically (e.g., therapeutically) effective would be exhaustive and impractical to list. Therefore, the term \u201cspecifically binds\u201d refers to the ability of a peptide to bind TFPI with greater affinity than it binds to an unrelated control protein that is not TFPI. For example, the peptide may bind to TFPI with an affinity that is at least, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, or 10,000 times greater than the affinity for a control protein. In some embodiments, the peptide binds TFPI with greater affinity than it binds to an \u201canti-target,\u201d a protein or other naturally occurring substance in humans to which binding of the peptide might lead to adverse effects. Several classes of peptides or proteins are potential anti-targets. Because TFPI-inhibitory peptides exert their activity in the blood stream and/or at the endothelium, plasma proteins represent potential anti-targets. Proteins containing Kunitz domains (KDs) are potential anti-targets because KDs of different proteins share a significant similarity. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is highly similar to TFPI-1\u03b1 and, like TFPI-1\u03b1, contains KDs (Sprecher et al., PNAS, 91, 3353-3357 (1994)). Thus, in one aspect, the peptide of the invention binds to TFPI with an affinity that is at least 5, 10, 15, 25, or 50 times greater than the affinity for an anti-target, such as TFPI-2.",

An exemplary TFPI-binding peptide binds TFPI with a KD of less than or equal to 20 nM and/or exhibits a binding affinity for TFPI that is at least 100 times greater than the binding affinity for an anti-target. Alternatively or in addition, the TFPI-binding peptide enhances FX activation in the presence of TFPI with an EC50 (as measured using any suitable assay, such as the assays described here) of less than or equal to 50 nM and/or enhances thrombin formation in the absence of Factor VIII to at least about 20% (e.g., 40%) of the level of thrombin formation in plasma containing physiological levels of Factor VIII. Alternatively or in addition, the TFPI-binding peptide achieves a desired level of plasma stability (e.g., 50% or more of a dose remains in plasma after 12 hours) and/or demonstrates a desired half life in vivo (e.g., at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten hours). Alternatively or in addition, the TFPI-binding peptide exhibits a desired level of bioavailability, such as a desired level of bioavailability following subcutaneous administration (e.g., greater than or equal to 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, or 50%) and/or demonstrates a desired level of TFPI-inhibitory activity at a given dose in vivo.",

For example, a TFPI-inhibitory peptide reduces TFPI-inhibition of the extrinsic pathway at least about 5% (e.g., at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 30%). In some embodiments, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide reduces TFPI activity within the extrinsic pathway at least about 50%, at least about 75%, or at least about 90% compared to TFPI activity in the absence of the peptide.",

By \u201cclotting factor-deficient\u201d is meant that the subject suffers from a deficiency in one or more blood factors required for thrombin formation, such as FVIII, FIX, or FXI. Indeed, in one embodiment, the subject is deficient in FVIII. Alternatively or in addition, the subject is deficient in Factor IX. Clotting factor deficiencies are identified by examining the amount of factor in a clinical sample. Practitioners classify hemophilia according to the magnitude of clotting factor deficiency. Subjects suffering from mild hemophilia have approximately 5% to 30% of the normal amount (1 U/ml) of Factor VIII or Factor IX. Moderate hemophilia is characterized by approximately 1% to 5% of normal Factor VIII, Factor IX, or Factor XI levels, while subjects suffering from severe hemophilia have less than 1% of the normal amount of Factor VIII, Factor IX, or Factor XI. Deficiencies can be identified indirectly by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) testing. APTT testing measures the length of time required for a blood clot to form, which is longer for patients with Factor VIII Deficiency (hemophilia A), Factor IX Deficiency (hemophilia B), and Factor XI Deficiency (hemophilia C) compared to patients with normal clotting factor levels. Almost 100% of patients with severe and moderate Factor VIII deficiency can be diagnosed with an APTT.

Blood coagulation factors include, but are not limited to, Factor V (FV), FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXIII, FII (responsible for hypoprothrombinemia), and von Willebrand's factor. Factor deficiencies are caused by, for instance, a shortened in vivo-half life of the factor, altered binding properties of the factor, genetic defects of the factor, and a reduced plasma concentration of the factor. Coagulation disorders can be congenital or acquired. Potential genetic defects include deletions, additions and/or substitution within a nucleotide sequence encoding a clotting factor whose absence, presence, and/or substitution, respectively, has a negative impact on the clotting factor's activity. Coagulation disorders also stem from development of inhibitors or autoimmunity (e.g., antibodies) against clotting factors. In one example, the coagulation disorder is hemophilia A. Alternatively, the coagulation disorder is hemophilia B or hemophilia C.",
                        "Platelet disorders are caused by deficient platelet function or abnormally low platelet number in circulation. Low platelet count may be due to, for instance, underproduction, platelet sequestration, or uncontrolled patent destruction. Thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiencies) may be present for various reasons, including chemotherapy and other drug therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, accidental blood loss, and other disease conditions. Exemplary disease conditions that involve thrombocytopenia are: aplastic anemia; idiopathic or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with breast cancer; HIV-associated ITP and HIV-related thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; metastatic tumors which result in thrombocytopenia; systemic lupus erythematosus, including neonatal lupus syndrome splenomegaly; Fanconi's syndrome; vitamin B12 deficiency; folic acid deficiency; May-Hegglin anomaly; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; chronic liver disease; myelodysplastic syndrome associated with thrombocytopenia; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; acute profound thrombocytopenia following C7E3 Fab (Abciximab) therapy; alloimmune thrombocytopenia, including maternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia associated with antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis; autoimmune thrombocytopenia; drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, including carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; fetal thrombocytopenia; gestational thrombocytopenia; Hughes' syndrome; lupoid thrombocytopenia; accidental and/or massive blood loss; myeloproliferative disorders; thrombocytopenia in patients with malignancies; thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, including thrombotic microangiopathy manifesting as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome in cancer patients; post-transfusion purpura (PTP); autoimmune hemolytic anemia; occult jejunal diverticulum perforation; pure red cell aplasia; autoimmune thrombocytopenia; nephropathia epidemica; rifampicin-associated acute renal failure; Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia; neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; hematologic changes in stomach cancer; hemolytic uremic syndromes (e.g., uremic conditions in childhood); and hematologic manifestations related to viral infection including hepatitis A virus and CMV-associated thrombocytopenia. Platelet disorders also include, but are not limited to, Von Willebrand Disease, paraneoplastic platelet dysfunction, Glanzman's thrombasthenia, and Bernard-Soulier disease. Additional bleeding disorders amenable to treatment with a TFPI-inhibitory peptide include, but are not limited to, hemorrhagic conditions induced by trauma; a deficiency in one or more contact factors, such as FXI, FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK); vitamin K deficiency; a fibrinogen disorder, including afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and dysfibrinogenemia; and alpha2-antiplasmin deficiency.

Accordingly, \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d includes therapeutic and prophylactic measures. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any degree of protection from, or amelioration of, a blood coagulation disorder or symptom associated therewith is beneficial to a subject, such as a human patient. The quality of life of a patient is improved by reducing to any degree the severity of symptoms in a subject and/or delaying the appearance of symptoms. Accordingly, the method in one aspect is performed as soon as possible after it has been determined that a subject is at risk for developing a blood coagulation disorder (e.g., a deficiency in a clotting factor (e.g., FVIII, FIX, or FXI) is detected) or as soon as possible after a blood coagulation disorder (e.g., hemophilia A, hemophilia B, or hemophilia C) is detected. In an additional aspect, the peptide is administered to protect, in whole or in part, against excessive blood loss during injury or surgery.",

The amount of peptide administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) and the conditions of administration (e.g., timing of administration, route of administration, dosage regimen) are sufficient to affect the desired biological response over a reasonable time frame. Dosage typically depends upon a variety of factors, including the particular TFPI-inhibitory peptide employed, the age and body weight of the subject, as well as the existence and severity of any disease or disorder in the subject. The size of the dose also will be determined by the route, timing, and frequency of administration. Accordingly, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect, and conventional range-finding techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Purely by way of illustration, in one aspect, the method comprises administering, e.g., from about 0.1 \u03bcg/kg to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage may range from 1 \u03bcg/kg up to about 75 mg/kg; or 5 \u03bcg/kg up to about 50 mg/kg; or 10 \u03bcg/kg up to about 20 mg/kg. In certain embodiments, the dose comprises about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg (e.g., about 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 2.3 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 3.5 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 5.5 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, 6.5 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, 9 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) of peptide. Given the chronic nature of many blood coagulation disorders, it is envisioned that a subject will receive the TFPI-inhibitory peptide over a treatment course lasting weeks, months, or years, and may require one or more doses daily or weekly. In other embodiments, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide is administered to treat an acute condition (e.g., bleeding caused by surgery or trauma, or factor inhibitor/autoimmune episodes in subjects receiving coagulation replacement therapy) for a relatively short treatment period, e.g., one to 14 days.",
                        "Suitable methods of administering a physiologically-acceptable composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition comprising a peptide described herein, are well known in the art. Although more than one route can be used to administer a peptide, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. Depending on the circumstances, a pharmaceutical composition is applied or instilled into body cavities, absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes, ingested, inhaled, and/or introduced into circulation. In one aspect, a composition comprising a TFPI-inhibitory peptide is administered intravenously, intraarterially, or intraperitoneally to introduce the peptide of the invention into circulation. Non-intravenous administration also is appropriate, particularly with respect to low molecular weight therapeutics. In certain circumstances, it is desirable to deliver a pharmaceutical composition comprising the TFPI-inhibitory peptide orally, topically, sublingually, vaginally, rectally, pulmonary; through injection by intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraportal, intralesional, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intranasal, urethral, or enteral means; by sustained release systems; or by implantation devices. If desired, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide is administered regionally via intraarterial or intravenous administration feeding a region of interest, e.g., via the femoral artery for delivery to the leg. In one embodiment, the peptide is incorporated into a microparticle as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,439,686 and 5,498,421, and U.S. Patent Publications 2003/0059474, 2003/0064033, 2004/0043077, 2005/0048127, 2005/0170005, 2005/0142205, 2005/142201, 2005/0233945, 2005/0147689. 2005/0142206, 2006/0024379, 2006/0260777, 2007/0207210, 2007/0092452, 2007/0281031, and 2008/0026068. Alternatively, the composition is administered via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or another appropriate material on to which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device in one aspect is implanted into any suitable tissue, and delivery of the desired molecule is in various aspects via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration. In other aspects, the TFPI-inhibitory peptide is administered directly to exposed tissue during surgical procedures or treatment of injury, or is administered via transfusion of blood procedures. Therapeutic delivery approaches are well known to the skilled artisan, some of which are further described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,363.",

In one aspect, the human TFPI binding site is defined by amino acid residues Ala27, Phe28, Lys29, Ala30, Asp31, Asp32, Lys36, Ile38, Ile46, Phe47, and Ile55, such as a binding site defined by amino acid residues Ala27, Phe28, Lys29, Ala30, Asp31, Asp32, Lys36, Ala37, Ile38, Phe44, Ile46, Phe47, and Ile55. Any inhibitor that contacts the TFPI binding site defined herein and inhibits (downregulates or ablates) one or more TFPI activity is suitable for use in the context of the method. The TFPI inhibitor is, optionally, a TFPI-binding peptide, such as a TFPI-binding peptide having the characteristics described herein.",
                        "The invention further includes computer storage media and methods for modeling candidate TFPI-compounds in the TFPI binding site defined herein. Three dimensional (3D) modeling of proteins can be used in conjunction with 3D models of various test TFPI-binding compounds (e.g., peptides or small molecules) to determine fit between the compounds and targeted amino acids in TFPI. Because the effectiveness of a test compound in inhibiting TFPI can be limited if the compound does not remain attached to TFPI for a sufficient period of time to effect a biological response, the tendency of the two to remain coupled can be predicted to develop an affinity rating.",
                        "By analyzing the 3D surface of the TFPI protein and the fit of the corresponding compound to the surface in view of the affinity rating, modifications to the compound (e.g., peptide) can be developed to improve both the number of contact points between the surface and the compound and the strength of the bonds at the contact points. The effectiveness of chemical-based candidates and peptide-based TFPI inhibitors can similarly be modeled using this technique, which facilitates the rational design of TFPI-binding compounds. A computer model of the three dimensional (3D) surface of KD1 allows testing of the ability of various peptides or chemicals to attach to an identified subset of amino acids that define a TFPI binding site and inhibit KD 1. A surface of the KD 1 protein is modeled in 3D space on a computer, particularly a surface bounded by the targeted amino acids in KD 1. The 3D models of various peptides, for example, can be matched to the surface to determine how many of the target TFPI amino acids are contacted by the peptide and also to develop an affinity rating predicting how long the peptide will remain attached to the target surface.",
                        "By changing the peptide model and repeating the computer modeling, affinity ratings can be quickly generated for a peptide family. The most promising peptide variants (e.g., a second peptide comprising one or more substitutions within the amino acid sequence of a parent peptide) can be singled out for further physical testing, if desired.",

In one embodiment, the method further comprises determining a number of the contact points between the surface and the updated test compound 3D model; determining a bond type for each contact point between the surface and the updated test compound 3D model; and recording a new affinity rating based on the number of contact points and an aggregate of the bond types for each contact point between the surface and the updated test compound 3D model.

Methods for synthesizing candidate peptides are provided above. Candidate peptides were synthesized as trifluoroacetate (TFA) salts with a purity>90% or >60%. All peptides were solved in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. TFPI-binding peptide sequences were identified using an mRNA display library. The mRNA display technology is superior to other library screening techniques for allowing for a diversity of 1014 different sequences within a starting pool and avoiding, e.g., the in vivo steps required for phage display. In brief, the technology involves directly linking mRNA to its encoded candidate peptide through a puromycin molecule (FIG. 5). The mRNA display method is further described in International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/051985 and Liu et al., Methods in Enzymology, 318, 268-293 (2000). TFPI was immobilized to a solid support via biotin and exposed to candidate peptide-RNA complexes. TFPI-bound candidate peptide-RNA complexes were isolated, and the RNA reverse transcribed to obtain coding DNA. High affinity binders were obtained following six to ten selection rounds using a competitive elusion strategy. Many of the candidate peptides were 31 amino acids in length (27 randomized amino acids and 2 amino acids flanking both termini).",

Briefly, N-terminally, aminooxyacetate-modified peptides were printed on Corning epoxide glass slides. After washing and drying, the slides were treated in a TECAN HS400\u2122 incubation station. Slides were washed for two minutes in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% TWEEN 20\u00ae (TBST), and blocked for 30 minutes in Tris-based, T-20 SuperBlock\u2122 buffer (5 mM CaCl2) (Pierce).

The slides were scanned in an Axon GenePix\u00ae 4000B scanner, and scans were analyzed using the GenePix\u00ae Pro software. N- and C-terminal truncation analysis supplemented the scan analysis. The microarray scan results demonstrated that peptide JBT0293 bound TFPI with the highest affinity.

Plates were then washed three times with 350 \u03bcl HNaT. Biotinylated candidate peptides were diluted from a DMSO stock 1/200 in HNaT. The initial peptide concentration was 50 \u03bcM if no precipitate appeared during the 1/200 dilution of the 10 mM peptide stock solution. Pre-dilutions of the peptide stock in DMSO were conducted if precipitates formed. The diluted peptides were applied to the Maxisorp plates, serial dilutions (1/3) were generated, and the dilutions were incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Incubation was followed by three wash steps (350 \u03bcl HNaT). Bound peptide was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1 hour), followed by three wash steps with HNaT and a subsequent chromogenic conversion of added TMB (3,3\u20325,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidin).

The assay principle is depicted in FIG. 6B. Ninety-six well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were coated with 3 \u03bcg/mL TFPI in coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) over night. The concentration of TFPI can be altered depending on the particular conditions of the assay; in other IC50 ELISA assays referenced herein, the coating buffer contained 0.05 \u03bcg/ml TFPI. Plates were washed three times with 350 \u03bcl wash buffer (HNaT: 175 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 80, pH 7.35), and blocked with 200 \u03bcl 2% yeast extract in HNaT for 2 hours. Plates were then washed three times with 350 \u03bcl HNaT. Biotinylated tracer peptides were applied at a concentration corresponding to their respective EC90 values determined in the binding ELISA (median if n>2). A competitor stock solution of peptide (10 mM) was diluted 1/33.3 in HNaT without HSA, and a serial 1/3 dilution was prepared with HNaT with 3% DMSO. The dilution strategy employed in a particular assay will depend on the affinity of the peptides. The dilution was further diluted with the biotinylated tracer peptide in a ratio of 1:6 (20 \u03bcl competitor dilution and 100 \u03bcl tracer peptide). The mixture of competitor and tracer peptide was applied to the TFPI-coated microtiter plate and incubated for 1.5 hours. The plates were washed three times with 350 \u03bcl HNaT. Peptide-TFPI binding was detected by applying HRP-conjugated streptavidin to the microtiter plate, incubating the mixture for one hour, washing the plate three times with 350 \u03bcl HNaT, applying TMB (3,3\u20325,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidin), and detecting the subsequent chromogenic conversion of TMB by HRP.

TFPI proteins were immobilized on a C1 chip (GE Healthcare, Order Code: BR-1005-40) by amine coupling chemistry aiming for 500 RU. Several TFPI-binding peptides were employed as analytes for interacting with the immobilized TFPI proteins. A flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min was utilized.

Peptides were diluted 1/6.25 from 10 mM stocks (in DMSO) and further diluted by serial 1/4 dilutions in buffer or DMSO to prevent unwanted precipitation. TFPI was diluted in HNaCa-HSA or BSA (25 mM HEPES; 175 mM NaCl; 5 mM CaCl2; 0.1% HSA or BSA; pH 7.35). FVIIa, lipidated TF, phospholipid vesicles (DOPC/POPS 80/20), and chromogenic substrate specific for FXa (S-2222 (available from DiaPharma, West Chester, Ohio)), all diluted in HNaCa-HSA, were added to 96-well plates. After an incubation period, TFPI and peptide dilutions were added, resulting in a final concentration of 2.5% DMSO (if present in the peptide stock). FX activation was initiated by adding FX to the wells. FXa-mediated chromogenic substrate conversion was determined by observing an increase in absorbance using a micro-plate reader. The amount of FXa generated at certain time points was calculated from the OD readings. FXa generated at 20 minutes after start of the reaction was considered for calculation of EC50 from plots of peptide concentration versus the inhibition of TFPI (%).",

Substitution of Tle at position 9 (generating JBT2431) and substitution of Pro at position 10 (generating JBT2432) blocked cleavage of the peptide and enhanced the plasma stability of the peptide by about three-fold from 27% (JBT1857) to 82% (JBT2431) and 76% (JBT2432). An additional putative cleavage site was identified between Gly11 and Tyr12. A G11a substitution (generating JBT2414) further improved the stability of the peptide to 100%.

HSQC spectra of a \u02dc500 \u03bcM 15N-TFPI160 sample without and with increasing amounts of peptide were recorded at 30\u00b0 C. on a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer. The peptide-protein interaction showed slow exchange behavior (kex<<\u0394\u03c9), meaning that each TFPI residue results in a defined signal for the free protein and the protein-peptide complex. Unlike fast exchange behavior (kex>>\u0394\u03c9), where a mixture results in only one peak with averaged position according to the population of the species, slow exchange behavior does not allow tracking of the signals upon peptide binding. Thus, in order to locate the binding site, the shifted peaks of the TFPI160-JBT0303 complex needed to be assigned. This required the preparation of a sample of 13C/15N-TFPI160 and JBT0303.",

However, the NMR sample resulted in poor quality spectra which did not allow assignment of the complex. The sample gelled, likely due to the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. Thus, the acquired NMR data predominantly showed signals arising from the most flexible parts of the isotope-labeled TFPI160. Therefore, sample conditions were reinvestigated for further experiments. From a series of 15N-HSQC experiments conducted on the TFPI160-JBT0303 complex, it was concluded that gel formation could be avoided by sample dilution and data acquisition at elevated temperature. The final concentration of 13C/15N-TFPI160 was 331 \u03bcM and that of JBT0303 was 397 \u03bcM. Spectra quality was improved.

The amide exchange experiment mainly detects changes in the environment of the peptide backbone by measuring H exchange of amide groups. The H2O frequency is irradiated with a power high enough that it is not dissipated by relaxation, resulting in a complete saturation and suppression of the H2O signal. A side effect of this method of H2O signal suppression is that the suppression is transferred to exchangeable amide NHs which exchange with solvent (H/H exchange). The saturation transfer is dependent on the H/H exchange rate which is semi-quantitative. The effect is reduced for more protected NH groups (i.e., unprotected NHs are attenuated more than protected NHs). If a protected NH lies in proximity to H-alphas of a ligand, a higher exchange rate is observed compared to the apo form. Similarly, H exchanges can be mediated by the OH groups of Ser, Thr or Tyr.",

TALOS is a database system for empirical prediction of \u03c6 and \u03c8 backbone torsion angles using a combination of five kinds (HA, CA, CB, CO, N) of chemical shift assignments for a given protein or peptide sequence. The TALOS approach is an extension of the observation that many kinds of secondary chemical shifts (i.e., differences between chemical shifts and their corresponding random coil values) are correlated with aspects of protein secondary structure. The goal of TALOS is to use secondary shift and sequence information in order to make quantitative predictions for the protein backbone angles \u03c6 and \u03c8, and to provide a measure of the uncertainties in these predictions. TALOS uses the secondary shifts of a given residue to predict \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles for that residue. TALOS also includes the information from the next and previous residues when making predictions for a given residue. The idea behind TALOS is that if one can find a triplet of residues in a protein of known structure with similar secondary shifts and sequence to a triplet in a target protein, then the \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles in the known structure will be useful predictors for the angles in the target. In practice, TALOS searches a database for the 10 best matches to a given triplet in the target protein.",

HADDOCK is an information-driven flexible docking approach for the modeling of biomolecular complexes. HADDOCK distinguishes itself from ab-initio docking methods in the fact that it encodes information from identified or predicted protein interfaces in ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. Identification of the binding site on TFPI160 and the peptides as revealed by chemical shift data, the torsion angles of the peptides as determined by the software TALOS, and the substitution analysis of JBT0477 provide the restraints for the calculation of the models.",

For the remaining residues of JBT0303 considered to drive the peptide-protein interaction, the models are in good agreement with the data. The model of KD1-JBT0303 with the lowest energy places F8 of JBT0303 in proximity to F25 and F28 of TFPI, explaining the observed chemical shift changes and the data from the substitution analysis. V9 of JBT0303 interacts with the hydrophobic patch of the KD1 including F54. Y12, F13, L16 and L20 of JBT0303 also face the hydrophobic patch of the KD1. The proximity of Y12 to F28, I46, T48 of F13 to F47, T48, of L16 to F54 and of L20 to A37, I38 causes the observed perturbations of NMR chemical shift of those residues in the complex; the conservation of Y12 and L16 may be due to the extensive interactions of these residues with the protein. K19 of JBT0303 is in a position allowing interaction with D32 of KD1. The role of R15 of JBT0303 seems to be an interaction with the hydrophobic patch of KD1 as well as with D32. Moreover, the model explains why a negatively charged aspartate is preferred at position 10 of JBT0303; it can interact with the positively charged K29 of KD1. A glycine at position 11 of JBT0303 is present due to the steric and conformational restraints at this position. A HADDOCK model of KD1 (TFPI residues 22-79 comprising KD1) in complex with JBT0303 is provided in FIG. 55.",

                                "JBT1857 structure: The structure of JBT1857 can be segmented into (i) the N-terminal anchor consisting of acetylated Phe1AP-Gln2AP; (ii) an \u03a9-shaped loop comprising Ser3AP-Asn6AP; (iii) an intermediate segment built from Val7AP and His8AP; (iv) a tight glycine-loop containing Val9AP-Gly11AP; and (v) the C-terminal \u03b1-helix comprising Tyr12AP-Leu20AP. As used herein, the subscript AP indicates the sequence numbering in the \u201cantagonistic peptide\u201d JBT1857. The conformation of the \u03b1-helix is stabilized by a non-natural a-methyl alanine positioned at the center of the helix (position 17AP); a C-terminal amide that completes the 1-4 hydrogen bonding pattern of the \u03b1-helix; and a stacked cluster by the aromatic side chains of His8AP, Tyr12AP and Phe13AP. These effects cooperate to stabilize the C-terminal \u03b1-helix spontaneously in solution, consistent with circular dichroism data on the peptide. The observed aromatic side chain stacking (His8AP, Tyr12AP, Phe13AP) enforces a tight turn that can be only accomplished by glycine at position 11AP. This structural constraint is reflected by dramatic losses in binding affinity upon replacement of Gly11AP by any other amino acid. The conformation of the N-terminal loop segment is partly stabilized by a D-proline, known to induce a tight turn conformation, and a 1-4 hydrogen bond by the carbonyl oxygen of Ser3 with the amide nitrogen of Asn6. All ring side chains (Tyr1AP, Pro5AP, His8AP, Tyr12AP, Phe13AP) point towards the same direction, enabling them to interact with the KD 1 domain of TFPI.",
                                "Interaction of JBT1857 and KD1: The interactions between JBT1857 and KD1 were determined. Hydrophobic contacts are interactions having an intermolecular distance of \u22664 \u212b, while hydrogen bonds have a distance between 2.6-3.2 \u212b. Phe1AP interacts non-specifically with TFPI making contacts with Phe2 and Ala27. In contrast, Gln2AP contacts a deeply buried pocket of TFPI and makes hydrophobic interactions with Phe28, Lys29, Ile46 and Phe47. Moreover, the amide group of Gln2AP forms three H-bonds with Phe28-CO, Phe44-CO and Ile46-NH. The \u03a9-loop of JBT1857, comprising Ser3-Asn6, mediates rather limited hydrophobic interactions with the protein; Ser3, Pro5 and Asn6 interact with Lys29 and Phe47. Val7AP of JBT1857's intermediate segment also binds to Lys29 and Phe47. His8 mainly contributes intramolecular aromatic stacking interactions with Tyr12AP and partly with Phe13AP, and exhibits a hydrophobic interaction with Ala30 of TFPI. Similarly, the glycine-loop Val9AP-Gly11AP contributes few contacts with the Kunitz domain. Val9AP interacts directly with KD1 by forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Ala30 and a hydrophobic interaction with Asp32. Tyr12AP mediates a hydrogen bond via its hydroxyl group with the amide nitrogen of Ile55 and a hydrophobic interaction with Asp30. Leu16 is part of a hydrophobic contact with Ile55. Beside the largely hydrophobic interactions of the C-terminal helix of the peptide with the protein, there are electrostatic interactions between Arg15AP and Asp32. Furthermore, Lys19AP contributes to binding with TFPI by forming a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of Ala37 and contacts with Lys36 and Ile38. The TFPI contact surface has an overall hydrophobic character with some charted hot spots, and a driving force of complex formation with JBT1857 is the steric surface complementarity.",

The affinity and TFPI-inhibitory activity of JBT1837 and JBT1857 were examined using the assays described in Examples 1-4, the results of which are summarized in Table 15.",
                                "Affinity of the peptides to human TFPI measured via BiaCore was less than 1 nM. Affinity measured by ELISA (IC50) was 4.8 nM for JBT1837 and 2.5 nM for JBT1857. JBT1837 dissociated from human TFPI more slowly than JBT1857 (i.e., JBT1837 remained bound to human TFPI for a longer period of time compared to JBT1857). A FXa inhibition assay was performed using both full length human TFPI (\u201cflTFPI\u201d) and truncated human TFPI (254 amino acids \u201cR&D TFPI\u201d) (0.1 nM FXa, 0.5 nM TFPI, 0.25% DMSO). Activity of the truncated TFPI was fully inhibited by both JBT1837 and JBT1857 at 0.5 nM TFPI, while full length TFPI was inhibited 85% and 95% by JBT1857 and JBT1837, respectively. At higher concentrations of flTFPI (e.g., 10 nM flTFPI), JBT1837 fully inhibited TFPI activity, while JBT1857 partially inhibited TFPI activity. EC50's also were higher when flTFPI was used in the FXa inhibition study.",
                                "In the extrinsic tenase assay, about 85% of truncated TFPI was inhibited by both peptides. Full length TFPI activity was inhibited about 56% and 48% by JBT1837 and JBT1857, respectively. Surprisingly, in the cell-based extrinsic tenase assay, JBT1837 inhibited the activity cell-associated TFPI by about 50% whereas JBT1857 almost fully inhibited cell-bound TFPI activity. In the plasma-based functional assay, JBT1837 inhibited TFPI more efficiently than JBT1857 in human FVIII-inhibited plasma and FIX-deficient plasma. JBT1837 corrected blood coagulation parameters in FVIII-inhibited blood in the ROTEM assay described in Example 8. JBT1857 also positively impacted blood coagulation parameters, but performed less efficiently than JBT1837 in the assay.",
                                "This example compared the affinity and TFPI-inhibitory activity of cyclic and linear TFPI-binding peptides that target different regions of the TFPI protein. JBT1837 (a cyclic peptide belonging to family JBT0120) and JBT1857 (a linear peptide belonging to family JBT0047) efficiently bind human TFPI with affinities less than 1 nM and are potent inhibitors. FXa-TFPI interaction is fully blocked at low TFPI concentrations by both peptides, while TFPI inhibition by JBT1857 is reduced in the presence of higher concentrations of TFPI. Both peptides partially inhibit the activity of full-length TFPI in the extrinsic tenase assay, and JBT1857 inhibits TFPI activity to a greater degree in the cell-based extrinsic tenase assay compared to JBT1837. Compared to JBT1857, JBT1837 more efficiently inhibits TFPI in FVIII-deficient plasma. Both peptides improve coagulation parameters of FVIII-inhibited human whole blood by reducing clot time, while JBT1857 improves clot formation velocity to a lesser degree compared to JBT1837.",

FVIII knock-out mice closely minor the condition of hemophilia A patients, and the tail-tip bleeding model is widely used in research to assess efficacy of drugs by measuring, e.g., bleeding time, blood loss or survival. ADVATE, a commercially available rFVIII, served as a reference, and ADVATE buffer-treated animals served as negative controls. Each group contained 16 FVIII knock-out mice (8 female+8 male). JBT2329 (1 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) or anti-TFPI antibody (maTFPI; 18 mg/kg) was administered 30 minutes before the tail-tip was cut. ADVATE (10 IU/kg or 50 IU mg/kg) or ADVATE buffer was administered five minutes before the tail was cut off. Test and control substances were administered as an intravenous bolus via a lateral tail vein injection. Animals were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Approximately 10 minutes later, 2 mm of the tail-tip was cut off. The tail-tips were placed in warm saline (approximately 37\u00b0 C.) and blood was collected over an observation period of 60 minutes. The amount of blood was determined gravimetrically. At the end of the observation period of 60 minutes the animals were humanely killed by cervical dislocation before recovery from anesthesia.",
                                "Median total blood loss in buffer-treated animals was 930 mg. Median total blood loss in subjects treated with murine anti-TFPI antibody (maTFPI) was 724 mg. The reduction in median total blood loss was more pronounced when the subjects were administered maTFPI with ADVATE. A combination of maTFPI+10 IU/kg ADVATE led to a median total blood loss of 136 mg, animals treated with maTFPI+50 IU/kg ADVATE experienced a median total blood loss of 13 mg. Median blood losses of animals treated with either 10 or 50 IU/kg ADVATE alone experienced median blood loss of 798 and 364 mg, respectively. The superiority of the combination treatment of maTFPI+ADVATE over ADVATE alone was statistically shown for maTFPI+50 IU/kg ADVATE versus 50 IU/kg ADVATE (p=0.0010). Although not statistically significantly superior, blood loss in animals treated with maTFPI+10 IU/kg ADVATE was distinctively lower than in animals treated with 10 IU/kg ADVATE alone.",

Animals treated with JBT2329 in combination with ADVATE showed a clinically-relevant reduction in blood loss, although the results were not statistically significant (p\u22670.0506). Administration of 1 mg/kg JBT2329 without ADVATE did not reduce median total blood loss over that observed in buffer-treated animals (930 mg).",

The methodology was substantially similar to that described above with respect to the FVIII knock-out model. Instead of ADVATE, a recombinant FIX (rFIX) served as a reference. Median total blood loss in buffer-treated animals was 935 mg. Median total blood loss in animals treated with a murine anti-TFPI antibody (maTFPI) was 774 mg. Median total blood loss was reduced further when the animals received combined treatment of maTFPI and rFIX. A combination of maTFPI+10 IU/kg rFIX led to a median total blood loss of 25 mg, while animals treated with maTFPI+50 IU/kg rFIX exhibited a median total blood loss of 10 mg. Median blood loss of animals treated with either 10 or 25 IU/kg rFIX alone experienced a median blood loss of 888 and 774 mg, respectively.",
                                "Efficacy, defined as statistically significant superiority over buffer at a 2.5% level, was shown for JBT2329 when dosed at 1 mg/kg in combination with 10 IU/kg rFIX and at 0.1 mg/kg in combination with 10 IU/kg rFIX. The superiority of JBT2329 in combination with rFIX over administration of rFIX alone was observed (p<0.0172), while treatment with 1 mg/kg JBT2329 alone did not lead to a significant reduction in median total blood loss compared with buffer-treated animals (p=0.321).",
