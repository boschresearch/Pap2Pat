    "title": "Use of FKBPL gene to identify a cause of infertility",
    "date": "2008-12-15 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Fertility problems affect (1 in 10) couples in Western society, making it one of the most common serious health issues. Despite this, little is known about the causes of infertility, and thus patient counseling and treatment are suboptimal. With infertility being such a common problem, identification of any cause would impact on a large number of patients, allowing better counseling, clearer diagnoses and the possibility of making more informed choices (e.g. adoption vs. IVF treatment). The present invention provides methods to identify a cause of infertility in a subject based on the genotype of the subject, in particular, by evaluating the status of the gene encoding FK506 binding protein-like (FKBPL). In particular, the present invention relates to use of the status of the gene encoding FK506 binding protein-like for identification of a cause of an infertile phenotype in a subject. Also provided, are methods method for identifying an infertile phenotype in a subject, and identifying a cause of an infertile phenotype in a subject. This diagnostic tool finds wide clinical utility in the identification of a cause of infertility, resultantly impacting on a large number of patients. Further aspects of the present invention relate to the targeting of FKBPL in order to temporarily and reversibly induce infertility in a subject. Such aspects of the present invention find utility in the development of a male contraceptive pill. Moreover, due to the high degree of homology between the human and mouse FKBPL gene, FKBPL can be targeted in order to induce infertility in mice (or other species) as a form of pest control or animal husbandry.",

                        "Fertility problems affect 1 in 10 couples in Western society, making it one of the most common serious health issues. Despite this, little is known about the causes of infertility, and thus patient counseling and treatment are suboptimal. The condition of infertility is multifactorial, with known causes of infertility including environmental factors, genetic alterations, and physical defects. Male infertility accounts for approximately half of the cases of reproductive failure in humans, with as many as 1 in 5 cases of male infertility having oligo- or azoospermia of unknown origin (Chandley et al., 1975). Since there are a number of possible causes, processing of cases can be time-consuming, and failure to identify the source of the problem can be very unsatisfactory for the couple. In about 15% of cases, moreover, the infertility investigation will show no abnormalities. In these cases abnormalities may be present but not detected by current methods. With recent advances in assisted reproduction techniques (ART), such as testicular sperm extraction (TSE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (Craft et al., 1993), successful conception can be achieved in more cases than ever before, increasing the urgency of identifying inherited factors responsible for infertility. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a means to identify the causes of infertility, in particular in a subject where other diagnoses have failed.",
                        "Studies have indicated that microdeletions on the Y chromosome encompassing the DAZ or AZF genes are the cause of some types of azoospermia (Reijo et al., 1995; Vogt et al., 1992). Other known causes include mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) (Dowsing et al., 1999), important for sex hormone signaling, and in the synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3) (Miyamoto et al., 2003), a vital component of the structure which aligns chromosome pairs at meiosis, among others. However, altogether these still only account for a fraction of azoospermia cases, suggesting that other genetic causes remain to be discovered. In this connection, only a small number of genes have been identified as carrying mutations in infertile men. Previous studies have shown that targeted deletions of FKBP6 and FKBP52, members of the FK506 binding protein cochaperone family, cause male infertility in mice, but so far no mutations have been found in these genes in humans.",
                        "From studies of the role of the FKBP proteins, a number of possible functions for these cochaperones have been proposed. Some evidence suggests that they may alter receptor affinity for its cognate ligand, possibly by altering the folding of the ligand-binding domain (Riggs et al., 2003). Other work suggests that ligand binding is not affected in all cases, but that the stability of the receptor may be compromised in the absence of the cochaperone (CheungFlynn et al., 2005). A third point of action may be through involvement with nuclear transport. Studies have shown that FKBP52 binds to dynein, linking the receptor:HSP90 complex to the microtubule transport machinery (Periyasamy et al., 2007). Finally, other work suggests that FKBP52 may modulate activity of the androgen receptor (AR) through effects on transcription (CheungFlynn et al., 2005; Gallo et al., 2007; Yong et al., 2007), possibly by affecting coactivator recruitment.",
                        "FK506-binding protein-like (FKBPL) is a divergent member of the FKBP family of proteins, named for their ability to bind the immunosuppressant drug FK506. FKBPL belongs to that subfamily of FKBP, which act as cochaperones for steroid receptor complexes (Pratt and Toft, 2003). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of these receptors undergoes a process of maturation, which is essential for their activation. This subfamily has two major domains: one that has a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPI) activity, and the other containing tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). The FKBPL protein shows low homology over the PPI domain and lacks critical residues, which have been shown to be required for enzymatic activity (Kay, 1996), but is relatively well conserved at the TPR. The only known function of TPR is to avidly bind Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) and the characterised TPR-containing members of the FKBP family have been shown to act as cochaperones with HSP90 to mediate steroid receptor folding and activation (Pratt and Toft, 2003). A dimer of the chaperone HSP90 binds to the receptor dimer and guides the folding, intracellular localisation and turnover of the protein, with the aid of cochaperones (Felts and Toft, 2003; Smith, 2004; Sullivan et al., 2002). FKBP bind HSP90 via conserved tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerise (PPI) domain of the FKBP appears to be able to alter the folding of the LBD (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005; Riggs et al., 2007). This domain also appears to be important for linking the chaperone:client protein complex to the cytoskeleton for inward transport to the nucleus: two groups have shown that FKBP52 binds to dynamitin, linking the receptor-HSP90 complex to the microtubule transport machinery (Galigniana et al., 2004; Periyasamy et al., 2007). The end result of FKBP-receptor interactions appears to be modulation of the activity of the receptor through effects on transcription (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005; Yong et al., 2007; Gallo et al., 2007). The protein is highly conserved across several mammalian species, indicative of an important function. However, no mutations in FKBP52 (Beleza-Meireles et al., 2007) or FKBP6 (Westerveld et al., 2005) were found in azoospermic men.",
                        "There have been a number of targeted mutations generated in mice, which resulted in male infertility. In particular, mutations in two members of the FKBP family have resulted in male infertility. Mutations in FKBP52 were shown independently by two groups to result in male infertility and hypospadias with underdevelopment of the prostate and seminal vesicles, though the testes were normal (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005; Yong et al., 2007). Both groups found evidence for compromised AR activity in the knockout mice, and showed that FKBP52 potentiates AR signalling in response to androgen. In a separate study, a spontaneous mutation in FKBP6 was found in an inbred rat strain which had developed azoospermia: the causative role of this mutation was shown using targeted deletion in mice, which resulted in the same phenotype (Crackower et al., 2003).",

In FIG. 1B, Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPI) domains are shown by vertical shading, and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) are shown by diagonal shading.

High levels of expression in submaxillary gland and low levels in all other tissues were confirmed by northern blotting (data not shown).

                                "FKBPL, a less well-characterised member of the FKBP family, has been shown to bind HSP90 through its TPR domain (Jascur et al., 2005) and (McKeen et al., 2008) have recently shown that it interacts with and stimulates the activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in human cell lines. The fact that it interacts with GR and probably p53 is consistent with the behaviour of FKBP52, as shown by several groups (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005; Yong et al., 2007; Galigniana et al., 2004) and with the model proposed by Pratt's group, which suggests that the cochaperone client protein is tissue-dependent. FKBPL maps to human chromosome 6p21.3: linkage studies in a Japanese population (Tsujimura et al., 2002) implicate this region specifically in azoospermia (LOD score 3.5, p=0.0005) and it also shows clustering of chromosomal breakpoints in azoospermic males in the European population (www.MCNdb.org).",
                                "We found that FKBPL in humans maps to a region linked to azoospermia in a Japanese population (LOD score 3.5, p=0.0005) (Tsujimura et al., 2002). We examined 60 of the patient samples used in that study and 56 controls from the same population and looked for mutations in the FKBPL gene by direct sequencing. This identified two mutations in the gene in the azoospermic group: an insertion, which is predicted to alter a binding pocket (FIG. 3A), and a mutation in the canonical splice acceptor site (CAG/G->CGG/G) (FIG. 7), which is predicted to give loss of function. These were confirmed by sequencing individual clones and by sequencing of blinded samples at a second lab. Neither mutation was present in our control group. Some of the patient samples (14/60) also showed a different SNP pattern at some locations in the gene to those in the control group (Table 1), suggesting that these alterations may be significant or tightly linked to as-yet unidentified alteration elsewhere.",
                                "The table shows deviation from reference sequence for Patient group (top) vs Controls (bottom) at synonymous or non-coding sites mapped against sequence position. Coordinates are given with respect to the UCSC reference sequence for chromosome six.",
                                "Examination of the sixty patients from this cohort found a four amino acid insertion in the PPI domain in one patient, and a splice acceptor site mutation in another: both mutations were absent in a panel of fifty-six controls. The patient group SNP profile also differed from that of the control group (Table 1). For FKBPL, currently 14/60 patients have heterozygous alterations not seen so far in controls (23%), 2/60 are likely to be functional (3%). These data suggest that the mutations identified are associated with an azoospermic (or infertile) phenotype. This compares favourably with other mutations associated with male infertility: Y chromosome microdeletions are found in 2-20% of azoospermic males, depending on the study (Vogt et al., 1992); heterozygous mutations in SYCP3 which alter protein folding are found in 2/19 azoospermic males (11%) (Miyamoto et al., 2003); for USP9Y mutations, 17/576 patients showed alteration, but only 1 was de novo (3%-0.1%) (Sun et al., 1999), while for Protamine 1 (PRM1), heterozygous mutations were found in only 3/30 patients (10%) (Iguchi et al., 2006).",
                                "We also examined a second patient cohort of 30 patients from an Irish population where Y chromosome microdeletions have been excluded. Five of the patients had variations, which would alter the protein sequence of FKBPL (Table 2). The cohort from the Irish population showed two coding changes at SNPs in thirty azoospermic patients, which were not present in fertile controls."

                                "Given that our patients are azoospermic and infertile this suggested that FKBPL, like FKBP52, might be a cochaperone for Androgen Receptor in the testis. To check for AR interaction, we transfected LNCaP cells, an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line with high levels of AR, using a reporter construct (courtesy of Dr. J.-T. Liu) containing luciferase downstream of the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) transcriptional regulatory elements (Yong et al., 2007). To assess whether alterations in FKBPL affect AR function, the AR-positive prostate cell line, LNCaP, was transfected with a reporter containing luciferase driven by the prostate specific antigen (PSA) transcriptional regulatory elements. Referring to FIG. 5A, in the absence of the testosterone analogue R1881 little luciferase is detected. When ligand is added, transcription increases 50-fold due to AR action. With the addition of FKBPL, AR-mediated transcription increases instead 200-fold. FKBPL enhanced AR activity on the PSA reporter specifically in response to ligand (R1881). These results suggest that FKBPL enhances transcriptional activation by AR of a major target gene. Prostate cells expressing AR can turn on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (a known transcriptional target of the androgen receptor) reporter in the presence of a testosterone analogue (R1881).",
                                "Given that the splice acceptor site in patient 25 is predicted to prevent splicing into the only coding exon of the gene, AR activity in this patient is predicted to be suboptimal. To test whether the insertion seen in patient 83 is also functionally significant, we transfected LNCaP as above with a construct containing the cloned cDNA from this patient. A representative graph is shown in FIG. 5B. While enhancement of AR activity appeared lower in some experiments, results overall for this assay were inconclusive: it is possible however that the effects of this mutation may be stronger on AR target genes which are required for testis development. Mutant FKBPL, from a biological sample taken from patient 83 described above, shows decreased enhancement of Androgen Receptor-mediated transcription in LNCaP cells in response to ligand (left). PGL3-PV is a positive control (right). These data indicate that FKBPL does enhance the action of androgen receptor at a transcriptional level, and only in response to hormone, demonstrating a functional link between the androgen receptor and FKBPL.",
                                "Two members of the FKBP family of cochaperone proteins, FKBP52 and FKBP6, have previously been implicated in male sexual development in mice, but in case: control studies in humans no mutations were found in either gene in azoospermic males (Beleza-Meireles et al., 2007; Westerveld et al., 2005). FKBP6 has been reported to be a structural component of the synaptonemal complex and it is expressed at high levels in mouse testis (Crackower et al., 2003) but reprobing our array blots showed low levels of expression in epididymis and submaxillary gland (not shown), tissues where FKBPL levels were high. Expression in submaxillary gland is characteristic of steroid hormone signalling components (Jaskoll et al., 1994). FKBPL, like FKBP52 (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005), was expressed in human testis in Leydig and Sertoli cells as well as spermatogonial cells: FKBP6, on the other hand, is absent from Sertoli cells (Crackower et al., 2003). Sertoli cells are AR-producing cells located inside the testis tubules where they play a crucial role in regulation of the spermatogonia. Cell type-specific knockout of AR in the Sertoli cells leads to azoospermia in mice, reinforcing the importance of AR for male sexual maturation (Chang et al., 2004; De Gendt et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006). FKBP52 has been shown by two groups to act as a cochaperone for AR and to boost AR transcriptional activity in response to androgen (Cheung-Flynn et al., 2005; Yong et al., 2007). While the presence of FKBP52 in Sertoli and spermatogonial cells is consistent with a possible role in AR signalling, both groups found that gene knockouts in mice had no effect on the testis, but prostate and other secondary sexual organs expressing FKBP52 were reduced or absent. The expression pattern of FKBPL in human and mouse suggests a role in normal testis development which may be more similar to FKBP52 than FKBP6. Our data showing that transfection of FKBPL into the androgen responsive LNCaP cell line increases signalling through AR in response to ligand is consistent with this prediction.",
                                "FKBPL is a member of the TPR-containing subfamily of cochaperones and has been shown to bind to HSP90 via these repeats (Jascur et al., 2005). The PPI domain is poorly conserved and lacks conserved catalytic residues implicated in rotamase activity. Nevertheless, the protein is highly-conserved in mammals including across the PPI domain, suggesting a functional requirement. McKeen et al have recently shown that the PPI domain of FKBPL is important for interaction with dynamitin and subsequent nuclear translocation of steroid hormone:chaperone complex (McKeen et al., 2008). Pratt and coworkers have previously shown that the PPI domain of FKBP52 is also important for this interaction and for nuclear translocation in response to ligand (Galigniana et al., 2004). The splice acceptor mutation in patient 25 is predicted to prevent FKBPL production completely from this allele, which may reduce or abrogate entirely FKBPL protein levels in the cell if the protein is required for stability of a multimeric complex (Koi et al., 1994). The small insertion in patient 83 is predicted to alter a binding pocket in the PPI domain of the FKBPL protein, based on the crystal structure of FKBP52. Although not fully conclusive, our data suggest that the mutant FKBPL from this patient is also compromised in its ability to promote AR activity. FKBPL has also been reported to bind to p21 and enhance its stability (Jascur et al., 2005): however the mutant protein was able to coimmunoprecipitate p21 as efficiently as WT protein (data not shown). Other SNPs associated with azoospermia in our patient cohorts could be linked to more significant nearby alterations in regulatory regions or may have as-yet uncharacterised functional consequences.",
                                "The frequency of alterations in FKBPL in the azoospermic populations is low, but not inconsistent with the frequencies seen for other human genes implicated in infertility such as Y chromosome microdeletions (2-20% of infertile males (Vogt et al., 1992)); SYCP3 het. in 2/19 infertile males (Miyamoto et al., 2003)); USP9 (17/576 patients or 3% (Sun et al., 1999)) and Protamine 1 het. in 3/30 patients (10% (Iguchi et al., 2006)). A large number of genes will contribute to normal fertility so it is to be expected that the individual contributions of any one gene will be low, especially if autosomal. The heterozygous nature of the mutations uncovered so far, a feature of other genes implicated in human infertility (above) could indicate haploinsufficiency, or that the mutation on the other chromosome is as yet undetected due to a distal location. It is also of note that the FKBP6 gene in humans has been reported to be monoallelically expressed (Zhang et al., 2007). Further studies will be required to determine the frequency of mutations in the gene in other populations and to elaborate the possible functions of the protein.",
                                "In summary, FKBPL is a member of a cochaperone family which enhance steroid hormone receptor signalling and our data show that it is expressed in testis in human and mouse and that it is highly conserved. We have found mutations in the gene in azoospermic infertile patients, and have shown that the wild-type protein can enhance AR signalling in an androgen-responsive cell line, and AR is known to be crucial for male fertility.",
                                "Taken together these data suggest that FKBPL mediates the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of steroid hormone receptors, possibly by facilitating transport of ligand:receptor complexes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Furthermore, these data suggest that certain mutations in the FKBPL gene, which may result in atypical FKBPL activity, are associated with azoospermia. Accordingly, the present invention provides a means of determining such FKBPL gene alterations for the identification of a cause of infertility in a subject.",
                                "This diagnostic tool finds wide clinical utility in the identification of a cause of infertility, resultantly impacting on a large number of patients. By identifying causes of infertility, the present invention allows for the opportunity to offer patients better counseling, clearer diagnoses and the possibility of making more informed choices (e.g. adoption vs. IVF treatment).",
                                "Further aspects of the present invention relate to the targeting of FKBPL in order to temporarily and reversibly induce infertility in a subject. Such aspects of the present invention find utility in the development of a male contraceptive pill. Moreover, due to the high degree of homology between the human and mouse FKBPL gene, FKBPL can be targeted in order to induce infertility in mice (or other species) as a form of pest control or animal husbandry."
