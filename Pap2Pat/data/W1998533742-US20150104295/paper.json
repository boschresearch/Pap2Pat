    "title": "Parallel Piezoelectric Shunt Damping of Rotationally Periodic Structures",
    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the RL shunt damping of rotationally periodic structures with an array of regularly spaced piezoelectric patches. The technique is targeted to the damping of a specific mode withnnodal diameters. For this particular case, one can take advantage of the shape of the targeted mode to organize the piezoelectric patches as a modal filter (in parallel loops) which reduces the demand on the inductors of the tuned inductive shunt. In the case of a perfectly rotationally periodic structure, it is possible to organize 4npiezoelectric transducers (PZT patches) in two parallel loops of 2npatches each. In this way, the demand on the inductors is reduced by4n2as compared to independent loops, which may allow a fully passive integration of the RL shunt in a turbomachinery application. The method is first illustrated experimentally on a circular plate; it is then applied to a prototype of an industrial bladed drum. The influence of blade mistuning is investigated.",

                "New materials and new fabrication techniques in turbomachinery (e.g., blisks) lead to structures with extremely low damping which may be responsible for severe vibrations and possible high-cycle fatigue problems. The damping may be increased in various ways: blade friction damping [1], friction ring damper [2], viscoelastic damping treatment, or piezoelectric shunt [3,4], to name only a few.",
                "The use of piezoelectric transducers for damping structures has been known for a long time [5][6][7][8]; the piezoelectric transducer is used to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is dissipated in an electrical network. The R-shunt involves only a network of resistors; it has limited performances, but it is simple and robust. The RL shunt involves a set of resistors and inductors and the electrical network is tuned on the targeted mode. Damping simultaneously several modes is possible [9]. The performances are superior to the R-shunt, but the electrical network must be tuned accurately on the frequency of the targeted mode(s); it does not damp the other modes and, for the targeted ones, it is very sensitive to the variations of the natural frequencies. For most practical applications, the value of the inductance \ud835\udc3f required to achieve electrical tuning, (\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc36) -1/2 \u2243 \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc56 , is very large, which necessitates using synthetic inductors (electronic circuits called gyrator) [10]. Active components such as synthetic inductors are difficult to implement in rotating machines. The problems of the passive RL shunt may be overcome by using a switched shunt [11]; it does not require to be precisely tuned, nor a large inductor, but the switching synchronization is an issue, particularly when several vibration modes are involved, and, once again, active circuits make this solution impractical in rotating machines.",
                "In turbomachines, the blades are subjected to excitation frequencies which are multiple of the rotation speed (depending on the number of stator vanes). The normal modes of rotationally periodic structures consist of harmonically varying displacements in the circumferential direction which makes them very similar to axisymmetric structures [12]. Depending on the geometry of the stator part and the operating speed of the rotor, it is possible to identify the critical mode with a number \ud835\udc5b of nodal diameters, which is likely to be excited and must be targeted for damping.",
                "This paper presents a method for damping a particular mode with \ud835\udc5b nodal diameters: it consists of organizing the piezoelectric transducers in parallel loops grouping several of them to a single inductor. A set of 4\ud835\udc5b piezoelectric transducers (PZT patches) may be arranged in two parallel loops of 2\ud835\udc5b patches each; this allows reducing the demand on the inductors by 4\ud835\udc5b 2 as compared to independent inductive loops, while providing the same amount of damping on the targeted mode with \ud835\udc5b diameters. This offers the possibility of a purely passive integration of the piezoelectric RL shunt damping for turbomachinery structures. The method is illustrated on a circular plate and on a bladed drum with 76 blades (Figure 1). The effect of blade mistuning on performance is investigated."

It is possible to analyze the complete structure by considering only one substructure [13,14]. Considering two points at the same relative position in two adjacent sectors, the free vibration modes of cyclic structures are harmonic in the circumferential direction, which leads to nodal lines across the mode shapes called nodal diameters. Except for the modes with 0 and \ud835\udc41/2 nodal diameters for an even number \ud835\udc41 of blades, the modes occur by pairs (sine and cosine modes) with the same natural frequency.",
                "The natural frequencies are usually plotted as a function of the number \ud835\udc5b of nodal diameters as in Figure 2 (the plot depends on the rotation speed); the maximum number of nodal diameters is \ud835\udc41/2 if \ud835\udc41 is even or (\ud835\udc41 -1)/2 if \ud835\udc41 is odd. The frequencies of the drum-dominated modes tend to increase rapidly with the number of nodal diameters while the families of the blade-dominated modes appear as horizontal lines: first flexural mode denoted by 1F (corresponding to the first bending mode of a cantilevered blade), first torsion mode 1T, second flexural mode 2F, and so forth. For these modes, the strain energy is dominantly in the blades, although the drum accounts also for a small amount of it. The modes in the veering region where blade-dominated modes meet the drum-dominated modes tend to have significant  deflections (and strain energy) in both the blades and the drum [15].",
                "The forced response of periodic structures to a rotating point force has been analyzed by Wildheim [12]. For a rotationally symmetric structure excited by a rotating force (at \u03a9), the resonance of the mode with \ud835\udc5b nodal diameters is obtained when the natural frequency satisfies \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b\u03a9.

For a given rotation speed, these resonance conditions give a zig-zag line in the natural frequency versus nodal diameters diagram, which can be superimposed on the diagram of natural frequencies (for the same \u03a9), leading to Figure 3. Notice that the zig-zag line corresponds to a given rotation speed; if \u03a9 increases, the line expands like an accordion along the frequency axis. All the intersections between the two sets of lines, provided they occur at an integer value of \ud835\udc5b, correspond to a resonance condition, indicated by \u00d7. If the crossing occurs in the ascending part of the zig-zag line [\ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc5b = (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc41 + \ud835\udc5b)\u03a9], the resonant response consists of a forward rotating wave in the direction of the excitation; if the crossing occurs in the descending part of the zig-zag line [\ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc5b = (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc41 -\ud835\udc5b)\u03a9], the resonant response consists of a backward traveling wave. In turbomachinery, the excitation itself is periodically distributed (engine order excitation). For an excitation consisting of \ud835\udc60 rotating point forces, the resonance condition is more elaborate and involves the double equality [12] ",

Without elaborating further on the determination of the resonance, the point we want to make is that not all the modes are dangerous and, depending on the excitation order (e.g., air flow shaped by the geometry of stator parts) and the operating speed of the rotor, it is possible to identify the critical mode with a number \ud835\udc5b of nodal diameters which is likely to be excited and must be targeted for damping. The present paper addresses the damping of a specific mode with \ud835\udc5b nodal diameters."

In Figure 4(a), the curvature of the patches covering the cosine mode changes sign and, as a result, the electric charges produced on one half of the electrode are canceled by those produced by the opposite curvature on the other half of the electrode. Overall, no electric charge is produced. By contrast (Figure 4(b)), if the electrode layout is such that there are 4 independent electrodes per diameter (or a multiple thereof), the curvature keeps always the same sign over the electrodes. Besides, the curvature of the patches numbered 1 and 3 on Figure 4(b) has opposite signs for both the sine and cosine modes and similarly for the patches numbered 2 and 4. This suggests that if the patches number 1 and number 3 are mounted with inverted polarization, they can be mounted in parallel and act together and similarly for patches number 2 and number 4.",

Since it is fabricated in a single piece, the natural damping is extremely small, of the order of \ud835\udf09 \u2243 10 -4 . Right from the beginning of this project, placing the PZT patches on the blades was ruled out, to avoid any interference with the aerodynamics. As a result, 28 PZT patches working in \ud835\udc51 31 mode have been glued to cover almost completely the inner side of the blade support rim (Figure 8). Calculations and preliminary tests on a bladed rail showed that this configuration provides enough authority for damping vibration of the blade-dominated modes [18]. A model has been developed with Mindlin shell elements in the finite element software SAMCEF; the model includes specific piezoelectric elements for 28 PZT patches [19,20] excites all the 1F modes (it includes a contribution which is appropriate for all the modes).

For this example, each of the 28 electrical circuits would require an inductor of 0.7 H, which is not feasible with passive components.   The damping with parallel loops is considered in Figure 10. In this case, the 28 PZT patches are connected in two independent electrical loops of 14 patches each, with a capacitance of 14\ud835\udc36; this reduces the requirement on the inductor to only 2 inductors of about 50 mH (instead of 28 inductors of 0.7 H in the case of independent loops).

The natural damping has been measured in the range of \ud835\udf09 \u2243 10 -4 (this small value justifies the investigation of damping enhancement techniques). The inner side of the drum opposing the foot of the blades is covered by 28 PZT patches of rectangular shape (40 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 200 \ud835\udf07m; PI-PIC255) operating in the \ud835\udc51 31 mode. The PZT patches have all been glued with the same polarity and do not follow the layout of Figure 5 (this was done very early in the project, before the development of the damping strategy based on parallel loops); as a result, the parallel loop implementation requires four independent loops instead of two. A set of 28 synthetic inductors (based on Antoniou's circuit [21]) have been built to provide 28 independent tunable RL channels; for the sake of facility, synthetic inductors are used in all the following experiments. A small permanent magnet of 1.3 gr is attached to the tip of every blade and 38 of them (one every two blades) are used with custom-made voice coil actuators to excite the structure; the voice coil actuators are controlled independently with an array of 38 current amplifiers driven by a DSP board. The velocity of the blade tips is measured with a noncontact 2D Polytec laser scanner. A similar experimental setup is presented in [22]. [13] is due to slight differences in the blade geometry which make some of them more flexible than others and is responsible for a nonuniform distribution of the strain energy among the blades. The mistuning destroys the rotational periodicity and, in the worst situations, introduces localization effects. The mistuned modes have no longer pure harmonic shapes (circumferentially) but include various harmonic components, and there are no more cosine and sine modes with exactly the same frequency."

Figure 18(a) compares the normalized FRF \u1e8b /\ud835\udf02 between the forcing function and the velocity of blade #52 for three different conditions: (i) without shunt (all the electrodes are open), (ii) the 28 PZT patches shunted independently on separate RL circuits using 28 synthetic inductors (\ud835\udc3f \u2243 1 H), and (iii) the 28 patches connected in 4 independent groups of 7 patches working in parallel, with the electrical connections indicated in Figure 16; the four synthetic inductors have in this case \ud835\udc3f = 140 mH. Here again, the resistance in the RL loop is set to zero because the value of the internal resistance of the synthetic inductors exceeds the value of the optimal resistance. The cumulative RMS response \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udf14) for the three electrical connections is shown in Figure 18(b). One sees that, in this case where the mode shapes are much closer to circumferentially harmonic functions, the performance of the parallel shunt is nearly the same as that of the independent shunt for the targeted modes."

                "This paper considers the RL shunt damping of rotationally periodic structures with an array of regularly spaced piezoelectric patches. For the bladed drum considered in this study, it is possible to achieve a significant reduction of the blade vibrations with an array of piezoelectric transducers organized on the inner side of the blade support rim, without any disturbance to the compressor flow. The use of independent loops for the various transducers allows damping the entire 1F family of modes, but it usually requires synthetic inductors which are not practical for rotating machines. However, in many applications, by superimposing the \"zigzag\" lines on the natural frequency versus nodal diameters plot, it is possible to identify the critical mode with \ud835\udc5b nodal diameters which must be targeted for damping. If this is the case, by organizing 4\ud835\udc5b piezoelectric transducers (PZT patches) in two parallel loops of 2\ud835\udc5b patches each, the demand on the inductors may be reduced by 4\ud835\udc5b 2 as compared to independent loops, allowing the use of passive components. The method has been tested on a circular plate and on  a bladed drum with 76 blades. It has been found very effective when the targeted mode shape is close to harmonic circumferentially. The method seems to be applicable even in the presence of a moderate blade mistuning, but the performances are significantly degraded in the presence of substantial mistuning. Further investigations on the influence of mistuning are underway."
