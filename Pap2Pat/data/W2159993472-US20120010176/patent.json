                        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of a group of muscular dystrophies characterized by the enlargement of muscles. DMD is one of the most prevalent types of muscular dystrophy and is characterized by rapid progression of muscle degeneration which occurs early in life. DMD is X-linked and affect mainly males\u2014an estimated 1 in 3,500 boys worldwide. The degenerative muscle wasting and weakness usually culminates in lethality by age 30 to 40. While the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are well defined, DMD remains an incurable affliction.",
                        "The gene for DMD, found on the X chromosome, encodes a large protein-dystrophin. Dystrophin is required inside muscle cells for structural support: it is thought to strengthen muscle cells by anchoring elements of the internal cytoskeleton to the surface membrane and external structures. Without it, the muscle cannot produce force effectively and is susceptible to damage during contraction, eventually leading to muscle death and replacement by fatty and fibrous tissue. The accompanying immune response can add to the damage.",
                        "In addition to DMD, other diseases referred to as muscular dystrophy share a similar pathophysiology related to mutation or dysregulation of the dystrophin gene or an aberrant or dysfunctional dystrophin protein. Such other forms of muscular dystrophy include Becker's muscular dystrophy and some forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy.",
                        "Utrophin is an autosomal (6q24 encoded) homolog of dystrophin. In vivo, utrophin upregulation in the mdx mouse model of DMD (achieved via transgenic, viral vector, and transcription factor perturbation approaches) physiologically substitutes for dystrophin deficiency and can correct the disease."

The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds. Such modifications may also increase the compounds solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.",

                        "Subsequently, the 19 compounds were rescreened at 15 different concentrations. The results of the assay are shown in FIG. 1. Fourteen of the 19 compounds showed a dose-dependent activation of the utrophin promoter.",
                        "In some cases compounds were tested at a range of concentrations on test cells in a 96-well plate format. These results are shown in FIG. 2. Dose-dependent activation of the utrophin promoter was confirmed in 13 of the 14 compounds.",
                        "Thirteen compounds were found to exhibit dose-dependent activation of the utrophin promoter: The compounds and their codes shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 identified are: piperine [compound (II)]; apigenin [compound (III)]; chrysin [compound (IV)]; nabumetone [compound V)]; riluzole HCl [compound (VI)]; hesperetin [compound (VII)]; resveratrol [compound (VIII)]; phenazopyridine HCl [compound (IX)]; tiabendazole [compound (X)]; leflunomide [compound (XI)]; kawain [compound (XII)]; clorgyline HCl [compound (XIII)]; and equilin [compound (XIV)].",
                        "Moreover, the data from the screens on these compounds is summarized in the following table:",
                        "In a further experiment, the activity of kawain, equilin and nabumetone were evaluated in C2C12 muscle cells for upregulation of utrophin A mRNA (FIG. 3). C2C12 muscle cells were treated with optimal doses of compounds (based on previous dose-response data) for 24 hours, either in the presence of serum or in the absence of serum (following 24 hours of serum starvation). Trichostatin A and heregulin were used as positive controls for utrophin upregulation in the presence (trichostatin A) or absence (heregulin) of serum. Utrophin A mRNA was measured using a TaqMan qPCR assay and normalised to 18S rRNA. Data are presented as fold-changes in utrophin A mRNA compared to DMS O-only controls (compounds) or media-only controls (trichostatin A and heregulin).",
                        "Additional experiments were performed in C2C12 cells. As shown in FIG. 4, the compounds increase endogenous Utrophin A mRNA. C2C12 cells were treated with Prestwick compounds A, J, L and S plus TSA and heregulin (HRG) as positive controls. All compounds increased levels of endogenous utrophin A mRNA either in serum-containing or serum-free media.",
                        "In vivo experiments were perfomed in mice by treating with nabumetone. As shown in FIG. 5, muscle weights were increased on treatment. Soleus, gastrocnemius (gastroc), tibialis anterior (TA) and quadriceps (quads) were bigger in treated mice. EDL was not significantly bigger (* p<0.05). There was no difference in whole body weight between treatment groups.",
                        "FIG. 6 shows that treated muscles show increased force generation. Muscle function tested using a variety of parameters showed a trend towards increased force generating capacity and decreased force drop on eccentric contraction. Peak specific twitch force was significantly increased (* p<0.05).",
                        "Thus, the aforementioned compounds and their isomers, metabolites, prodrugs and analogs embodied herein, by increasing activity of the utrophin promoter and thus increasing expression or activity of utrophin, which corrects the deficiency in dystrophin expression or activity in muscular dystrophy, have potential therapeutic utility in this disease.",
                        "Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims."
