                        "Alopecia is the general term referring to any disease, disorder or condition involving hair loss. There are several different types of hair loss, the most common being androgenetic alopecia (AGA; see Sawaya, M. E. Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery 17(4):276-283, 1998), alopecia areata (AA; see Fiedler & Alaiti, Dermatologic Clinics 14(4): 733-738, 1996, as well as chemotherapy and drug-induced alopecia. Several hundred diseases have hair loss as a primary symptom.",
                        "Alopecia tends to be involuntary and unwelcome. However, it may also be caused by a psychological compulsion to pull out one's own hair or the unforeseen consequences of voluntary hairstyling routines. In some cases, alopecia is an indication of an underlying medical concern, such as iron deficiency or diabetes. Other medical conditions related to hair loss include effluviums, alopecia areata, scarring alopecia, congenital hypotrichosis, infection, and hair shaft defects. Hair loss can also be a side effect of certain therapeutic treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or treatment with anticoagulants, medicines used for gout, vitamin A, or antidepressants. Further, hair loss can be related to hormonal changes caused by conditions such as thyroid disease, childbirth, and the use of birth control pills. Significant hair loss has also been observed about three to four months after certain illnesses or major surgery.",
                        "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is by far the most common type of alopecia. AGA is a patterned, progressive loss of an excessive amount of hair from the scalp. Significant AGA occurs in 50% of men by the age of fifty and 50% of women by the age of sixty. AGA is believed to be a result of both genetic predisposition and the presence of a sufficient level of circulating androgens. It is thought that the enzyme 5 alpha reductase present in dermal papilla cells converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT binds to androgen receptors, also localized in the dermal papilla cells, triggering changes in the hair follicle that result in (1) shortening of the anagen or growth phase of the hair cycle, (2) development of a latent phase in the hair cycle following shedding of the telogen hair, and (3) follicular miniaturization process that reduces the caliber of the anagen hairs produced. It is thought that differential expression of 5-alpha reductase and/or androgen receptors in various types of hair follicles accounts for patterned hair growth and loss.",
                        "Hair loss in a defined part of the body is known as alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is a condition primarily affecting humans, in which hair is lost from areas of the body, usually from the scalp. In some cases, the condition can spread to the entire scalp (Alopecia totalis) or to the entire epidermis (Alopecia universalis). Conditions resembling alopecia areata, and having a similar cause, occur also in other species.",
                        "Some hair loss conditions go by the name \u201ceffluvium.\u201d Effluviums characteristically affect different phases of the hair growth cycle. Telogen effluvium occurs when there is a change in the number of hair follicles growing hair due to an increase in dormant, telogen stage hair follicles. Anagen effluvium is a diffuse hair loss like telogen effluvium, but it develops much more quickly and can cause individuals to lose all their hair. Anagen effluvium is most frequently seen in people taking cytostatic drugs for cancer or those who have ingested toxic products like rat poison.",
                        "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where the individual's own immune system attacks hair follicles. Hair loss can also be related to other autoimmune conditions such as lupus.",
                        "Hair loss that spreads to cover the entire scalp is called alopecia totalis. If it spreads over the entire body, affecting scalp, eyebrows, lashes, beard, pubic hair, and everything else, then the condition is called alopecia universalis. If the alopecia is just limited to the beard area in men, it is called alopecia barbae.",
                        "Scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia, refers to a collection of hair loss disorders related to destruction of hair follicles and their replacement with scar tissue. Each specific diagnosis within this category is fairly rare, but some examples include dissecting cellulitis, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, follicular degeneration syndrome (previously called \u201chot comb\u201d alopecia), folliculitis decalvans, lichen planopilaris, and pseudopelade of Brocq, to name a few. Scarring alopecia may also be part of a much larger condition such as chronic lupus erythematosus.",
                        "Hypotrichosis refers to a condition of no hair growth. Hypotrichoses are conditions that affect individuals from birth and usually stay with them throughout their lives. The majority of hypotrichoses are due to genetic aberrations or defects of embryonic development. There are hundreds of types of genetic hypotrichoses. Often, affected individuals have other physical or mental problems beyond a lack of hair. Conditions such as Graham-Little syndrome, Ofuji syndrome, cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Jeanselme and Rime hypotrichosis, Marie Unna hypotrichosis, and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, among many others, can involve the symptom of hypotrichosis.",
                        "Congenital aplasia, triangular alopecia, congenital atrichia, and monilethrix are other developmental defects that effect hair growth.",
                        "Tinea capitis or \u201cringworm\u201d is a fungal infection that can cause patches of hair loss if it develops on the scalp.",
                        "Folliculitis is a term for focal inflammation of hair follicles. In the early stages of a folliculitis the hair fiber may still be present, but as the folliculitis progresses the hair often falls out. When folliculitis is severe, the inflammation can permanently destroy the hair follicles, leaving bald patches. There are forms of folliculitis which are non-infectious such as those caused by oils and greases applied to the skin that clog up the hair follicles, but folliculitis is usually due to a bacterial infection, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. It is also possible to have viral, fungal, or yeast induced folliculitis involving Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster, Pityrosporum ovale, Trichophyton rubrum and other causative agents.",
                        "Piedra (Trichomycosis Nodularis) is a condition where the hair fibers are infected by a fungus. There are two basic typres of piedra, black piedra and white piedra, referring to the color of the nodules formed on the hair fiber. Black Piedra is due to the fungus Piedra iahortae and is mostly found in tropical countries while white piedra is due to Trichosporon beigelii and is found mostly in Europe and Southern parts of the USA.",
                        "Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin condition that can also involve temporary hair loss if the dermatitis is located on the scalp or other terminal-haired skin areas. Conditions including Parkinson's disease, head injury, and stroke can also be associated with seborrheic dermatitis, and conditions like stress and chronic fatigue can worsen the condition.",
                        "In traction alopecia and trichotillomania, the hair is plucked out of the skin leaving clear bald patches or diffuse, thin hair.",
                        "Trichorrhexis nodosa is a focal defect in the hair fiber. When observed under the microscope most of a hair shaft looks entirely normal. However, in isolated spots along the length of a fiber swelling and/or fraying can be seen. These focal defects develop where there is an absence of cuticle.",
                        "Hair loss can also be related to treatment with cosmetic products, such as excessive shampooing or blow-drying, leading to problems such as overprocessing and cuticle stripping.",
                        "Fullerene molecules are a family of carbon allotropes that comprise closed cages of generally 20 to 200 carbon atoms and may also include chemical moieties attached to the exterior or incorporated within the cage. Fullerenes can be in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube. The most common fullerene to date is the C60 Buckminsterfullerene (IUPAC name (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene). Another fairly common buckminsterfullerene is C70, but fullerenes with 72, 76, 84 and even up to 100 carbon atoms are commonly obtained. Fullerene molecules can contain 500 or more carbon atoms.",
                        "Structural variations include nonclosed-cage structures, heterofullerenes, derivatives formed by substitution of hydrofullerenes, the fusion of organic rings or ring systems to the fullerene cage, chiral fullerenes, buckyball clusters, nanotubes, megatubes, polymers, nano \u201conions,\u201d linked \u201cball-and-chain\u201d dimers, and fullerene rings (see, e.g., Miessler and Tarr (2004) Inorg.

Fullerenes are generally carbon structures formed of five and six membered rings arranged so that the rings form a closed geodesic sphere or spheroid held together by a combination of single and double carbon:carbon covalent bonds. The fullerenes in this disclosure can be defined by the formula: C2s wherein s is greater than or equal to 30, such as from about 30 to about 200 or from about 30 to about 100. For example, the fullerenes include C60, C70, and similar molecules that range in molecular weight from C60 up to C84, C90, and larger such molecules, with shapes ranging from spheroidal to ellipsoidal, elongated and other shapes, and including not only single-walled but also multi-walled cages consisting of stacked or parallel layers. The fullerenes may be unmodified or underivatized. Alternatively, the fullerenes may enclose one or more atoms such as metal atoms, or other small chemical groups, inside the carbon cage; such fullerenes are sometimes called endohedral fullerenes. Fullerenes, as used herein, also includes structures with chemical functional groups attached to the surface of the carbon cage. The functional groups can be covalently bound to the carbon cage via opening carbon:carbon double bonds. Fullerenes also include other structural variants, derivatives, and/or modified or functionalized fullerenes as described herein and/or as known in the art. The fullerenes can be synthetic or naturally-occurring. Synthetic fullerene molecules can be prepared in a laboratory by known methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,177,248 and Kratschmer et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 170, 167-170 (1990)) or can be purchased commercially.",

Water soluble fullerenes are known in the art as described above, and can be synthesized for example by attaching one or more hydrophilic chemical groups to the surface of the carbon cage. Suitable hydrophilic chemical groups include hydroxyl or polyhydroxyl groups and N-palyaminoethyl groups. Non-limiting examples of water soluble fullerenes include C60(OH)n, C60(NH\u2014CH2\u2014CH3)n, and compounds 7 10 and 12. Many other examples of water-soluble fullerenes are known and can involve the addition of one or more polar groups such as phosphates, sulfates, ammonium, carboxylates, or other charged groups; hydroxyl and polyhydroxyl groups; and carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, and DNA.",

The hair loss can be total or partial. In one embodiment, the increase in hair count corresponds to an increase in terminal hairs, which are long, pigmented hairs that are produced by follicles with sebaceous (oil) glands. They are found on the scalp, beard, armpits and pubic areas and are in contrast to vellus hairs, which are short hairs, often only a centimeter or two long, that contain little or no pigment. The follicles that produce vellus hairs do not have sebaceous and never produce any other kind of hairs. Terminal hairs also differ from Lanugo hair, which develops on an unborn baby. In people who have inherited a tendency to baldness terminal hairs may gradually become thinner and shorter until they look like vellus hairs. This may be due to the growth of terminal hairs being influenced by hormones (e.g. androgens) while vellus hairs are not so influenced.",

In addition to treatment of hair loss, the methods described herein may be used for the stimulation of hair growth in areas not recognized as experiencing hair loss. As used herein, the term \u201chair growth\u201d comprises an increase in number of terminal hairs present. Terminal hair counts can be conducted in a number of ways as known in the art. A non-limiting example is where the terminal hair is counted by trained and validated technicians who perform a computer-assisted count on macrophotographs (see, e.g., Canfield, Dermatologic Clinics, 14:713-721 (1996)). In brief, a target area on the scalp is chosen, the hair clipped and the scalp permanently marked with a single dot tattoo in the center in order to facilitate the exact positioning at each subsequent photo session. The macrophotography is performed using a preset camera with a macro lens and a stand that provides a constant reproduction ratio and electronic flashes that reproducibly illuminate the area to photograph. The images are taken in triplicate, centering the camera using the tattoo and the color slide films are processed at a central facility. The quality of the images is assessed and large transparencies are made of the best images. The terminal hairs on the target circle of the transparencies are then counted by the trained technicians.",

The nonionic isotonising agent, if present, is added in customary amounts, for example in amounts of about 1 to about 3.5 percent by weight, such as in amounts of about 1.5 to 3 percent by weight.",
                        "In one embodiment, the fullerenes are delivered topically. For topical administration, the fullerenes may be in standard topical formulations and compositions including lotions, creams, suspensions, serums, or pastes. Solubilized fullerenes can also be added to other dermatological products, such as hair gels, shampoos, conditioners, styling products, soaps, or the like. Injection may also be used when desired. Oral administration of suitable formulations may also be appropriate in those instances where the fullerenes may be readily administered to the hair follicle and/or surrounding tissues or cells via this route.",
                        "Modes of administration can include delivery via a sustained release and/or controlled release drug delivery formulation and/or device. \u201cSustained release\u201d refers to release of a drug or an active metabolite thereof into the systemic circulation over a prolonged period of time relative to that achieved by oral administration of a conventional formulation of the drug. \u201cControlled release\u201d is a zero order release; that is, the drug releases over time irrespective of concentration. Single, multiple, continuous or intermittent administration can be effected.",
                        "The dose can be determined by one of skill in the art without an undue amount of experimentation. The dose of fullerene may be optimized by the skilled artisan depending on factors such as, but not limited to, the fullerene chosen, the physical delivery system in which it is carried, the individual subject, the underlying disorder and the severity of the disorder, the treatment period, frequency of administration, and the judgment of the skilled practitioner. For topical formulations (such as ointments) to be applied to the surface of the skin, exemplary concentrations of the fullerenes in the excipient range from about 0.001 to about 10% w/w, such as from about 0.005 to about 5% w/w, or from about 0.01 to about 1% w/w. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive in that the number of variables with regard to an individual treatment regime is large and considerable deviation from these values may be expected. When administered topically, the area to be treated may be massaged after application of the fullerenes.",
                        "In one embodiment, the fullerenes are delivered intradermally. For intradermal administration, the fullerenes may be in standard injectable formulations and compositions including suspensions or serums.",
                        "The fullerenes may be applied to a small or large area of the body or scalp depending on the area to be treated. The fullerenes may be applied to the skin and/or to the hair of the subject. The fullerene treatment may comprise a single administration. Alternatively, the treatment may be repeated. The frequency of treatment may vary. For example, the treatments could be daily, every two days, twice weekly, weekly, ever two weeks, twice monthly, every four weeks, monthly, every six weeks, every eight weeks, every two months, quarterly, twice annually, or annually, or other suitable time interval to stimulate hair growth, prevent hair loss, and/or maintain the prevailing condition. In one embodiment, the treatment is repeated at least once every six months, such as at least once every three months or at least once every two months.",
                        "In certain embodiments, such as cases where hair loss is observed, maintenance treatment on a regular basis may be initiated and sustained. The total number of treatments in any 3 month period can be from 1 to 90. The mode of administration and dosage may be readily adjusted using routine experimentation to produce a desired level of alopecia treatment without causing significant damage to the surrounding tissue. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that different fullerenes, different formulations, and different modes of administration will require different parameters in order to cause hair growth. Such parameters can be determined by simple dose-ranging studies. For example, a suitable method could involve: (a) taking a terminal hair count, (b) applying the fullerene compositions at various strengths, (c) waiting for varying lengths of time, and (e) reassessing hair counts. Alternatively, the study might involve some other methods of assessing hair growth such as (visual) assessment of the hair density, hair weight, and/or hair shaft diameter.",
