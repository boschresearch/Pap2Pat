    "date": "2021-11-01",
    "abstract": "Cell-based immunotherapy has become the new-generation cancer medicine, and off-the-shelf cell products that can be manufactured at large scale and distributed readily to treat patients are necessary. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are ideal cell carriers for developing allogeneic cell therapy because they are powerful immune cells targeting cancers without graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) risk. However, healthy donor blood contains extremely low numbers of endogenous iNKT cells. Here, by combining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene engineering and in vitro differentiation, we generate human allogeneic HSC-engineered iNKT (AlloHSC-iNKT) cells at high yield and purity; these cells closely resemble endogenous iNKT cells, effectively target tumor cells using multiple mechanisms, and exhibit high safety and low immunogenicity. These cells can be further engineered with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to enhance tumor targeting or/and gene edited to ablate surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and further reduce immunogenicity. Collectively, these preclinical studies demonstrate the feasibility and cancer therapy potential of AlloHSC-iNKT cell products and lay a foundation for their translational and clinical development.",

                "Over the past decade, immunotherapy has become the new-generation cancer medicine.1, 2, 3 In particular, T-cell-based cancer therapy has shown great promise.4 An outstanding example is the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T (CAR-T) cell adoptive therapy, which targets certain blood cancers at impressive efficacy and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CD19+ B cell malignancies.4, 5, 6 Adoptive transfer of in\u00a0vitro expanded tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) and T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T\u00a0cells also show promise in treating some blood cancers and solid tumors in the clinic.7,8 However, most of the current T\u00a0cell therapies fall in the category of autologous cell therapy, wherein T\u00a0cells collected from a patient are manufactured and used to treat that single patient. Such an approach is time consuming, logistically challenging, and costly; furthermore, for patients with heavily lymphopenic pretreatment or rapidly proliferative disease, it\u00a0might not always be possible to produce autologous cell products.5,9 Allogenic cell products that can be manufactured at large scale and distributed readily to treat a broad range of cancer patients therefore are in great demand.",
                "Conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells have been utilized for generating allogeneic cell products; however, these T\u00a0cells risk inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in allogeneic hosts due to histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility, thereby requiring additional gene editing to ablate their endogenous TCR expression that may potentially increase manufacture complexity.10, 11, 12, 13 Innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells that have no GvHD risk have been investigated; however, NK cells may have limited in\u00a0vivo clonal expansion and antitumor performance compared to T\u00a0cells.14,15",
                "Invariant NK T (iNKT) cells are a small population of \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes.16 iNKT cells have several unique features, making them ideal for developing off-the-shelf cellular therapy for cancer. Compared to conventional T\u00a0cells, iNKT cells can attack tumor cells using multiple mechanisms and at higher efficacy; can more effectively traffic to and infiltrate solid tumors; can alter solid tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment; and, most importantly, do not induce GvHD.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 However, human blood contains extremely low numbers of iNKT cells (0.001%\u20131%), making it very difficult to reliably grow large numbers of allogeneic iNKT cells for cell therapies.26 Moreover, allogeneic iNKT products expanded from blood may contain bystander allogeneic conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells and thus risk inducing GvHD. Technology breakthroughs are needed to exploit the allogeneic cell therapy potential of iNKT cells.",
                "Previously, we have established a method to generate large numbers of iNKT cells through TCR gene engineering of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) followed by in\u00a0vivo reconstitution; using this method, we have successfully generated both mouse and human HSC-engineered iNKT (HSC-iNKT) cells.27,28 However, such an in\u00a0vivo approach cannot be used to produce off-the-shelf mature allogeneic iNKT cells.27,28 Here, we intended to build on the HSC-iNKT engineering approach and develop an in\u00a0vitro culture method to produce large numbers of off-the-shelf human iNKT cells for allogeneic cell therapy applications. We report the preclinical development of the proposed allogeneic HSC-iNKT cell therapy, demonstrating its manufacture feasibility, cancer therapy potential, and high safety profile."

Note CD34+ cells comprise both hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; in this report we refer to CD34+ cells as HSCs. The Lenti/iNKT-sr39TK vector has been previously used to develop an autologous HSC-engineered iNKT cell therapy for cancer28; ATO is an in\u00a0vitro 3D culture that supports the human HSC differentiation into T\u00a0cells,29,30 while \u03b1GC is a synthetic agonist glycolipid ligand that specifically stimulates iNKT cells.16 We routinely achieved over 50% lentivector transduction rate of HSCs (Figure\u00a01B). Transduced HSCs were then placed in the stage 1 ATO culture, where they differentiated into human iNKT cells over a course of 8\u00a0weeks with over 100-fold expansion (Figures 1A and 1C). At the end of stage 1 culture, ATOs were dissociated into single cells that were then placed in the stage 2 \u03b1GC expansion culture for another 2\u20133\u00a0weeks, resulting in another 100- to 1,000-fold expansion and an AlloHSC-iNKT cell product of high yield and purity (Figures 1A and 1D).Figure\u00a01In\u00a0vitro generation of allogenic HSC-engineered iNKT (AlloHSC-iNKT) cells(A) Experimental design to generate AlloHSC-iNKT cells in\u00a0vitro.

                        "In the ATO/\u03b1GC culture, AlloHSC-iNKT cells followed a typical iNKT cell development path defined by CD4/CD8 co-receptor expression.31 During stage 1, AlloHSC-iNKT cells transited from CD4\u2212CD8\u2212 (DN) to CD4+CD8+ (DP), then toward CD4\u2212CD8+/\u2212 (Figure\u00a01E). At the end of stage 2, the majority (>99%) of AlloHSC-iNKT cells showed a CD4-CD8+/\u2212 (CD8 SP/DN) phenotype (Figure\u00a01E). Note that the end AlloHSC-iNKT cell product did not contain a CD4+CD8\u2212 (CD4 SP) population that are present in the endogenous human iNKT cells (Figure\u00a01E).31 In general, CD8 SP/DN human iNKT cells are considered to be proinflammatory and highly cytotoxic and thereby are desirable for cancer immunotherapy.24,31, 32, 33, 34, 35",
                        "Flow cytometry analysis showed that the AlloHSC-iNKT cell product comprised high-purity transgenic iNKT cells (Figure\u00a01D); single-cell TCR sequencing analysis confirmed that these AlloHSC-iNKT cells uniformly expressed the transgenic iNKT TCRs while nearly undetectable randomly recombined endogenous \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs (Figure\u00a01F). In sharp contrast to AlloHSC-iNKT cells, conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells isolated from health donor periphery blood (denoted as PBMC-Tc cells) expressed highly diverse endogenously recombined \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs, whereas iNKT cells isolated from health donor periphery blood (denoted as PBMC-iNKT cells) expressed a conserved invariant TCR \u03b1 chain (V\u03b124-J\u03b118) and limited diverse TCR \u03b2 chains (dominantly V\u03b211) (Figure\u00a01F).",
                        "The manufacture of AlloHSC-iNKT cells was highly robust; we generated AlloHSC-iNKT cell products of high purity and yield from all 12 donors tested (4 CB-HSCs and 8 PBSCs) (Figures 1G and 1H). Based on our results, it was estimated that from one CB donor (comprising \u223c5\u00a0\u00d7 106 CB-HSCs), \u223c5\u00a0\u00d7 1011 AlloHSC-iNKT cells could be generated that can potentially be formulated into \u223c500\u20135,000 doses (\u223c108-109 cells per dose based on the approved CAR-T cell therapy doses)4; from one PBSC donor (comprising \u223c5\u00a0\u00d7 108 PBSCs), \u223c3\u00a0\u00d7 1013 AlloHSC-iNKT cells could be generated that can potentially be formulated into \u223c30,000\u2013300,000 doses (Figure\u00a01G). The resulting AlloHSC-iNKT cell product contained pure transgenic iNKT cells and nearly undetectable bystander conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells, thereby lack of GvHD risk and suitable for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d application."

AlloHSC-iNKT cells displayed a phenotype closely resembling PBMC-iNKT cells but distinct from PBMC-Tc cells; they expressed high levels of memory T\u00a0cell markers (i.e., CD45RO), NK cell markers (i.e., CD161), and peripheral tissue and inflammatory site homing markers (i.e., CCR4, CCR5 and CXCR3) (Figure\u00a02A). When stimulated with \u03b1GC, AlloHSC-iNKT cells proliferated vigorously (Figure\u00a02B) and secreted high levels of Th0/Th1 cytokines (i.e., interferon-\u03b3 [IFN-\u03b3], tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], and interleukin-2 [IL-2]) but limited amounts of Th2 cytokines (i.e., IL-4) and Th17 cytokines (i.e., IL-17) (Figure\u00a02C), indicating a Th0/Th1-prone functionality of AlloHSC-iNKT cells that agrees with their CD8 SP/DN phenotype (Figures 1E and 2A).24,31, 32, 33 Intracellular staining showed that at the single-cell level, AlloHSC-iNKT cells produced exceedingly high levels of effector cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2) and cytotoxic molecules (i.e., perforin and granzyme B) (Figure\u00a02D).

Moreover, unlike NK cells, iNKT cells can resist cryopreservation57; we therefore wondered whether AlloHSC-iNKT cells might also improve on this aspect.",
                        "Using an in\u00a0vitro tumor cell killing assay, we evaluated the tumor killing efficacy of AlloHSC-iNKT cells in comparison with PBMC-NK cells (Figure\u00a03C). Five human tumor cell lines were used as targets, including a leukemia cell line (K562), a melanoma cell line (A375), a lung cancer cell line (H292), a prostate cancer cell line (PC3), and a multiple myeloma cell line (MM.1S). All five tumor cell lines were engineered to overexpress the firefly luciferase (Fluc) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) dual reporters to enable the convenient monitoring of these tumor cells using either luciferase assay or flow cytometry (Figure\u00a0S1A). Compared to PBMC-NK cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells exhibited a significantly enhanced tumor killing efficacy across all five tumor cell lines (Figures 3D, 3E, and S1B\u2013S1D). Interestingly, AlloHSC-iNKT cells sustained strong tumor killing efficacy after cryopreservation, whereas PBMC-NK cells were sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles and showed greatly reduced viability and antitumor capacity following cryopreservation (Figures 3D, 3E, and S1B\u2013S1D). Blocking of NK activating receptors (i.e., NKG2D and DNAM-1) reduced tumor killing efficacy of AlloHSC-iNKT cells (Figures 3F\u20133H and S1E\u2013S1G), confirming their NK-activating-receptor-mediated tumor-targeting function.",

A375-FG tumor cells were subcutaneously inoculated into NSG mice to form solid tumors, followed by a paratumoral injection of AlloHSC-iNKT or PBMC-NK cells (Figure\u00a03I). AlloHSC-iNKT cells effectively suppressed tumor growth at an efficacy higher than that of PBMC-NK cells, as evidenced by time-course live animal bioluminescence imaging (BLI) monitoring (Figures 3J and S1H), tumor size measurement (Figure\u00a03K), and terminal tumor weight assessment (Figure\u00a0S1I).",

Attractively, AlloHSC-iNKT cells may exhibit improved antitumor efficacy and cryopreservation resistance compared to NK-cell-based allogeneic cell therapy products."

The entire culture time (\u223c10\u201311\u00a0weeks) and cell yield (\u223c1011 per CB donor or \u223c1012 per PBSC donor) were similar to those of generating non-CAR-engineered AlloHSC-iNKT cells (Figures 1A and 1G).

Meanwhile, the tumor cell killing efficacy of AlloHSC-iNKT cells was enhanced by the addition of \u03b1GC that did not happen to PBMC-T cells, indicating an iNKT TCR-mediated antitumor function of AlloHSC-iNKT cells; this TCR-mediated antitumor function was also inherited by AlloBCAR-iNKT cells (Figure\u00a04E). Importantly, compared to AlloHSC-iNKT cells, AlloBCAR-iNKT cells showed stronger tumor cell killing, indicating a CAR-mediated antitumor function of AlloBCAR-iNKT cells (Figure\u00a04E). Therefore, AlloBCAR-iNKT cells are able to target MM tumor cells using the NK/TCR/CAR triple mechanisms, which may grant AlloBCAR-iNKT cells a higher tumor-targeting efficacy and an enhanced capacity to counteract tumor antigen escape compared to conventional BCAR-T cells (Figures 4D\u20134F).25,61,62",

Impressively, in high-tumor-load conditions, AlloBCAR-iNKT cells still managed to suppress tumor growth effectively and achieved tumor clearance in a fraction of experimental mice (two out of five mice); conventional BCAR-T cells suppressed tumor growth less well and could not achieve tumor clearance (Figures 4K\u20134N and S2E).",

In an in\u00a0vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, in sharp contrast to conventional PBMC-Tc cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells did not react to all the mismatched healthy donor PBMCs tested, as evidence by their lack of IFN-\u03b3 production (Figures 5A and 5B). In an in\u00a0vivo NSG mouse xenograft model, unlike PBMC-Tc cells that induced GvHD and killed experimental mice \u223c2\u00a0months after PBMC-Tc cell transfer, AlloHSC-iNKT cells did not cause GvHD and sustained long-term survival of experimental mice (Figures 5C and 5D). The lack of GvHD in AlloHSC-iNKT cell engrafted experimental mice was confirmed by histology analysis showing healthy tissue structures without lymphocyte infiltrations; on the contrary, analyses of PBMC-Tc cell engrafted experimental mice showed severe tissue damages associated with heavy lymphocyte infiltrations (Figures 5E and 5F). To study the influence of CAR engineering, we analyzed the GvH response of AlloBCAR-iNKT cells; BCAR-T cells were included as a control. Distinct from BCAR-T cells, AlloBCAR-iNKT cells showed no response in the in\u00a0vitro MLR assay (Figures S3A and S3B) and induced no GvHD in the human MM xenograft NSG mouse model (Figures S3C and S3D), indicating that CAR engineering and tumor encountering do not change the GvH-free safety feature of AlloHSC-iNKT cells.Figure\u00a05Safety study of AlloHSC-iNKT cells(A and B) Studying the graft-versus-host (GvH) response of AlloHSC-iNKT cells using an in\u00a0vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay.

We therefore have engineered a \u201csafety switch\u201d in AlloHSC-iNKT cell products by incorporating a suicide gene (i.e., sr39TK) in the human iNKT TCR gene delivery vector, resulting in AlloHSC-iNKT cells that are 100% labeled with the suicide gene (Figure\u00a01A). In cell culture, addition of guanosine analog (ganciclovir [GCV]) effectively killed AlloHSC-iNKT cells (Figure\u00a0S3E); in an NSG mouse xenograft model, administration of GCV effectively depleted AlloHSC-iNKT cells from all tissues examined (e.g., liver, spleen, and lung; Figures 5G\u20135I). Of note, GCV has been used clinically as a prodrug to induce sr39TK-mediated suicide effect in cellular products.64 Other alternative suicide switch systems (e.g., inducible Cas9 and truncated EGFR) can certainly be utilized.4,65, 66, 67",

                        "For allogeneic cell therapies, immunogenicity can be a concern, because allorejection by host T and NK cells can greatly limit the efficacy of therapeutic allogeneic cells.68 Host conventional CD8 and CD4 \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells reject allogeneic cells by recognizing mismatched HLA-I and HLA-II molecules, respectively.69,70 In a classical in\u00a0vitro MLR assay studying T-cell-mediated host-versus-graft (HvG) response via IFN-\u03b3 secretion reading, compared to endogenous conventional T and iNKT (i.e., PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT) cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells triggered a significantly reduced HvG response (Figures 6A, 6C, and S4A). Our previous RNA-seq study made the interesting observation that compared to endogenous immune cells (i.e., conventional \u03b1\u03b2T, iNKT, \u03b3\u03b4T, and NK cells), AlloHSC-iNKT cells globally downregulated the expression of many genes controlling the cell surface display of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules (Figure\u00a02I). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that compared to PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells expressed significantly reduced levels of HLA-I molecules and nearly undetectable levels of HLA-II molecules (Figures 6B and S4B), which may account for their resistance to T-cell-mediated HvG response (Figures 6C and S4A). Because IFNs can upregulate HLA-I expression,71 we studied HLA-I expression on AlloHSC-iNKT cells under IFN-\u03b3 stimulation (Figure\u00a0S5A). AlloHSC-iNKT cells slightly upregulated surface HLA-I expression after IFN-\u03b3 stimulation; however, their overall surface HLA-I level still remained significantly lower than those of PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT cells (Figures S5B and S5C). Because an in\u00a0vivo inflammatory tumor microenvironment may upregulate the expression of HLA molecules on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (e.g., via IFN-\u03b3),72 we also assessed HLA expression on AlloHSC-iNKT cells in an A375-FG human melanoma xenograft NSG mouse model adapted from a previous study (Figures 3I). A375-FG melanoma cells were subcutaneously inoculated in NSG mice to form solid tumors, followed by injection of AlloHSC-iNKT cells; PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT cells were included as controls (Figure\u00a06D). Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating AlloHSC-iNKT cells showed that these cells maintained low expression of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules at levels significantly lower than those of tumor-infiltrating PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT cells (Figures 6E and 6F).Figure\u00a06Immunogenicity study of AlloHSC-iNKT cells(A\u2013C) Studying allogenic T\u00a0cell response against AlloHSC-iNKT cells using an in\u00a0vitro MLR assay.

                        "Next, we studied NK-cell-mediated allorejection. Host NK cells reject allogeneic cells through a double-trigger mechanism: (1) \u201cmissing self\u201d (i.e., missing of matching HLA-I molecules on allogeneic cells) triggers the release of KIR inhibition, and (2) a \u201cstress signal\u201d (i.e., upregulated stress molecules on allogeneic cells) triggers the activation of NK activating receptors such as NKG2D.52,73,74 Because AlloHSC-iNKT cells expressed low levels of HLA-I molecules, we wondered whether this might make AlloHSC-iNKT cells susceptible to host NK rejection. Surprisingly, in an in\u00a0vitro MLR assay studying NK-cell-mediated allorejection, compared to endogenous conventional T and iNKT (i.e., PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT) cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells survived rejection by mismatched healthy donor PBMC-derived NK cells significantly better (Figures 6G\u20136I and S6); correspondingly, NK cells co-cultured with AlloHSC-iNKT cells exhibited less upregulation of NK activation markers (i.e., CD107a) (Figures S4D and S4E). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that compared to PBMC-Tc and PBMC-iNKT cells, AlloHSC-iNKT cells expressed much reduced and nearly undetectable levels of NKG2D ligands (i.e., ULBP; Figures 6J and S4C),75 which may be one of the possible mechanisms accounting for their resistance to NK-cell-mediated allorejection.",

We therefore explored further engineering of the AlloHSC-iNKT cell products to achieve total ablation of their surface HLA-I/II molecules. Interestingly, this task can be accomplished by ablation of only two genes: (1) a B2M gene encoding the beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) that is required for the surface display of all types of HLA-I molecules,69 and (2) a CIITA gene encoding the class II transactivator (CIITA) that is required for the transcription of all types of HLA-II molecules.70 Ablation of B2M and CIITA genes can be achieved by using the powerful gene-editing tools like the CRISPR-Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) system.76 We postulated that by combining iNKT TCR gene engineering and B2M/CIITA gene editing, we would produce HLA-ablated \u201cuniversal\u201d HSC-iNKT (UHSC-iNKT) cells totally resistant to host T-cell-mediated allorejection. We intended to perform both gene engineering and gene editing on the small numbers of starting HSCs upfront of the HSC-iNKT cell culture; this manufacturing design would save on the use of gene-engineering/editing materials (i.e., lentivector and CRISPR-Cas9/gRNA) that can be cost-limiting, and also enable the maximal gene engineering/editing efficiency that can be carried on into the final UHSC-iNKT cell products. Similar to the generation of AlloCAR-iNKT cell products (Figure\u00a04A), a CAR engineering step can be incorporated after UHSC-iNKT cell differentiation, resulting in HLA-ablated universal CAR-engineered HSC-iNKT (UCAR-iNKT) cell products.",
                        "CB or PBSC-derived CD34+ HSCs were transduced with the Lenti/iNKT-sr39TK lentivector; 24\u00a0h later, these HSCs were electroporated with a CRISPR-Cas9/B2M-CIITA-gRNAs complex (Figure\u00a07A). The gene-engineering/editing efficiency was high; we routinely achieved over 50% lentivector transduction rate and over 50% HLA-I/II double-ablation rate (Figures 7B and S7B). The engineered HSCs were then put into the HSC-iNKT differentiation ATO culture for 8\u00a0weeks followed by 1\u00a0week of \u03b1GC expansion (Figures 7A); CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing did not interfere with HSC differentiation into iNKT cells and we obtained high yield of differentiated UHSC-iNKT cells similar to that of AlloHSC-iNKT cells (Figures 1C and 7C). CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing also did not interfere with the follow-up CAR engineering; we obtained an efficient BCMA-targeting CAR (BCAR) engineering rate similar to that of engineering PBMC-derived conventional BCAR-T cells (Figure\u00a07C). The high HLA-I/II double-ablation rate of the starting HSCs was inherited by the resulting UBCAR-iNKT cells (i.e., \u223c50% of the resulting cells were HLA-I/II double negative); if needed, the HLA-I/II double-negative cells could be further enriched (to over 97%) using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) via B2M and HLA-II magnetic beads labeling (Figures 7D).Figure\u00a07Development of HLA-ablated universal HSC-iNKT (UHSC-iNKT) cells and derivatives(A) Experimental design to generate UHSC-iNKT and BCMA CAR-engineered UHSC-iNKT (UBCAR-iNKT) cells.

See also Figure\u00a0S7.",
                        "Despite HLA-I/II ablation, UBCAR-iNKT cells displayed a typical iNKT phenotype and a highly cytotoxic functionality similar to those of AlloBCAR-iNKT cells (Figure\u00a0S7A). As expected, UBCAR-iNKT cells induced nearly undetectable T-cell-mediated alloresponse when mixed with mismatched healthy donor PBMCs (Figures 7E, 7F, and S7F); meanwhile, UBCAR-iNKT cells maintained the resistance to NK-cell-mediated allorejection (Figures 7G, 7H, and S7G). Safety features of UBCAR-iNKT cells resembled those of AlloBCAR-iNKT cells: UBCAR-iNKT cells did not mount GvH response (Figures S7C and S7D), and they were sensitive to sr39TK/GCV-induced suicide control (Figure\u00a0S7E).",
                        "To study whether HLA ablation may impact the antitumor efficacy of UBCAR-iNKT cells, we performed in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo antitumor assays. In an established in\u00a0vitro MM tumor cell killing assay (Figure\u00a04C), UBCAR-iNKT cells effectively killed tumor cells at an efficacy comparable to that of AlloBCAR-iNKT cells (Figures 4E, S7H, and S7I). Similar to AlloBCAR-iNKT cells, UBCAR-iNKT cells could also utilize an NK/TCR/CAR triple mechanisms targeting tumor cells (Figures 4E, 4F, S7I, and S7J), which may grant them an advantage over conventional BCAR-T cells to gain additional antitumor efficacy (Figure\u00a0S7I), as well as to counteract the BCMA antigen escape that has been reported in conventional BCAR-T cell therapy clinical trials.25,61,62 In an established in\u00a0vivo human MM xenograft NSG mouse model (Figure\u00a04G), UBCAR-iNKT-cell-treated animals achieved total tumor clearance and long-term survival, while BCAR-T-cell-treated animals only achieved partial tumor suppression that was followed by tumor relapse and GvHD development, leading to limited survival benefit (Figures 7I\u20137L).",
                        "Collectively, these studies support the generation of HLA-ablated universal HSC-iNKT cell products and derivatives (e.g., CAR-iNKT cell products) that are fully resistant to host T-cell-mediated allorejection and thereby may have improved in\u00a0vivo persistence and antitumor efficacy."

                "Here, we report the generation and characterization of allogeneic HSC-engineered iNKT cells and derivatives. Using an in\u00a0vitro HSC-iNKT differentiation cell culture, we generated AlloHSC-iNKT cells that were of high yield and purity and had high antitumor efficacy, high safety profile (GvH-free and suicide control), and low immunogenicity (largely resistant to T- and NK-cell-mediated allorejection). These AlloHSC-iNKT cells could be further engineered to express CAR, thereby enhancing their tumor-targeting capacity; these cells can also be further engineered to ablate their surface HLA molecules, thereby enhancing their resistance to host T-cell-mediated allorejection. Collectively, our studies have generated AlloHSC-iNKT cells and demonstrated them as promising cell carriers for developing off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy.",
                "Development of allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapies, many equipped with CARs, is becoming a fast-evolving frontier of cancer immunotherapy. Two major categories of such allogeneic cell products are based on engineering healthy-donor-derived conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells or NK cells.14,68,69,77 Because conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells risk inducing GvHD in allogeneic hosts due to HLA incompatibility, these T\u00a0cells need to be gene edited to ablate endogenous TCR expression, usually by disrupting the TRAC or/and TRBC gene loci, to make them suitable for allogeneic cell therapy but meanwhile may also potentially increase manufacture complexity.10, 11, 12, 13 On the other hand, NK-based allogeneic cell products are considered of low GvHD risk and therefore do not require additional gene editing, but their in\u00a0vivo clonal expansion and antitumor performance may be limited compared to that of conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells.14 Two such allogeneic cell products, conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell-based universal CD19-CAR-engineered T\u00a0cells (UCART19) and NK-cell-based CB-derived CD19-CAR-engineered NK cells, were recently tested in phase 1 clinical trials treating CD19+ B cell malignancies.10,78 These studies reported the feasibility, certain antileukemic activity, and manageable safety profile of the two cell products, showing an encouraging step forward for the field of allogeneic cell therapy.10,78",
                "Engineering unconventional innate-type T\u00a0cells (e.g., iNKT, \u03b3\u03b4 T, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells) that have potent antitumor capacity while being free of GvHD risk represents another promising direction for developing allogeneic cell therapy for cancer, especially for solid tumors.25,79, 80, 81, 82, 83 In particular, iNKT-cell-based cancer immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention. A preclinical study reported the enhanced anti-lymphoma activity of CAR19-engineered iNKT cells compared to conventional CAR19-T cells.25 Another preclinical study reported the potent antitumor efficacy to neuroblastoma and no GvHD risk of CAR.GD2-engineered iNKT cells compared to conventional CAR.GD2-T cells.80 A recent clinical trial testing autologous GD2.CAR-engineered iNKT cells also showed safety and certain efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.79 These studies suggest the therapeutical potential of iNKT-based cell products and support the development of such cell products for allogeneic cell therapy for cancer even solid tumors.",
                "The in\u00a0vitro HSC-iNKT differentiation cell culture was robust and of high yield (Figure\u00a01G). The resulting AlloHSC-iNKT cell products were of high purity and nearly free of bystander conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a01D), which may allow these cell products to be directly used for allogeneic cell therapy without an additional purification step; if necessary, commercially available human iNKT cell isolation reagents (e.g., human anti-iNKT microbeads from Miltenyi) can be used for further purification. Notably, we detected no expression of endogenous TCRs in AlloHSC-iNKT cells (Figure\u00a01F), suggesting an induction of allelic exclusion by transgenic iNKT TCRs as previously reported.27,28 The robustness, high yield, and high purity of AlloHSC-iNKT cell products will facilitate their next-stage translational and clinical development.",
                "The antitumor efficacy of AlloHSC-iNKT cells is promising. These cells display a typical iNKT phenotype and functionality; they co-express memory T\u00a0cell and NK cell markers, express high levels of inflammatory tissue/tumor homing markers, and produce high levels of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, outperforming T and NK cells (Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, compared to endogenous cells (i.e., T, NK, and iNKT cells), AlloHSC-iNKT cells express exceedingly high levels of NK activating receptors and low levels of NK inhibitory receptors (Figure\u00a02G), which is associated with their superior antitumor NK function in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a03). In addition, the NK/TCR/CAR tumor-targeting triple mechanisms of AlloHSC-iNKT cells and their derivatives grant these cells a stronger antitumor efficacy (Figures 4D\u20134F, 7I\u20137J, and S6G\u2013S6I) and may enable them to counteract tumor antigen escape, which has been observed in T-cell-based cancer therapies.4,25,61,62 Overall, in both the human blood cancer (i.e., MM) and human solid tumor (i.e., melanoma) preclinical mouse xenograft models utilized in\u00a0this study, AlloHSC-iNKT cells or their CAR derivatives (i.e., AlloBCAR-iNKT and UBCAR-iNKT cells) showed an enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to healthy donor PBMC-derived NK or CAR-engineered conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T\u00a0cells, highlighting their cancer therapy potential (Figures 3I\u20133K, S1H, S1I, 4G\u20134N, S2E, and 7I\u20137L). Notably, a synthetic iNKT cell antagonist, \u03b1GC, has been demonstrated to specifically stimulate and expand iNKT cells in both preclinical and clinical studies; \u03b1GC is clinically available and may be used as a \u201cdesigner stimulator\u201d to enhance the in\u00a0vivo performance of AlloHSC-iNKT cells.18,23,84, 85, 86",
                "The safety of AlloHSC-iNKT cells is appealing. In our studies, AlloHSC-iNKT cells showed no GvH responses against multiple random healthy donor PBMCs in an in\u00a0vitro MLR assay (Figures 5A, 5B, S3A, and S3B) and no GvHD in\u00a0vivo in multiple human tumor xenograft NSG mouse models (Figures 5C\u20135F, S3C, and S3D), consistent with their iNKT cell nature and high purity (Figure\u00a01).16 A suicide switch (e.g., sr39TK/GCV) can also be incorporated into AlloHSC-iNKT cells to provide an additional safety control (Figure\u00a05G, 5I, and S3E). The high safety of AlloHSC-iNKT cells strongly support their allogeneic application.",
                "A serendipitous feature of AlloHSC-iNKT cells is their significantly lower immunogenicity compared to PBMC-derived endogenous immune cells (i.e., \u03b1\u03b2 T, iNKT, \u03b3\u03b4 T, and NK cells). AlloHSC-iNKT cells express reduced levels of HLA-I molecules and nearly undetectable levels of HLA-II molecules, which seems to be genomically programmed (Figure\u00a02I) and stable through the in\u00a0vitro culture and in\u00a0vivo persistence even within the tumor microenvironment (Figures 6A\u20136F); this feature may allow these cells to resist allorejection by host T\u00a0cells and thereby alleviate the need for additional HLA gene editing or intense host T\u00a0cell depletion preconditioning treatment (e.g., CD52 antibody treatment).10,13 Meanwhile, AlloHSC-iNKT cells also express reduced levels of NK activating receptor ligands (e.g., ULBP) (Figure\u00a06J); this feature may allow these cells to also resist allorejection by host NK cells and increase their suitability for allogeneic cell therapy (Figures 6G\u20136I). The biological regulations resulting in this low-immunogenicity feature of AlloHSC-iNKT cells remain to be illustrated; nonetheless, such biological regulations do not seem to interfere with the production or antitumor efficacy of AlloHSC-iNKT cells both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (Figures 3, 4, and 7).",
                "The AlloHSC-iNKT cell production platform is robust and versatile, allowing the plug-in of additional engineering approaches. In our studies, we demonstrated the successful generation of CAR-engineered or/and HLA-I/II-ablated AlloHSC-iNKT cells by incorporating additional CAR gene engineering and CRISPR-Cas9/B2M-CIITA-gRNAs gene-editing steps (Figures 4 and 7). These additional engineering approaches did not interfere with the production and antitumor function of AlloHSC-iNKT cells, opening up the possibility of developing more advanced AlloHSC-iNKT cell products. For example, incorporation of multiple tumor-targeting molecules (e.g., CARs and TCRs) and functional enhancement factors (e.g., overexpression of immune enhancement genes like IL-15, and ablation of immune inhibitory genes like PD-1) may improve the cancer therapy potential of AlloHSC-iNKT cell products.87,88"
