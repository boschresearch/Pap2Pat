The T cells may be produced from human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and are suitable for allogeneic cellular therapy because they do not induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and resist host immune allorejection. Consequently, such cells are suitable for off-the-shelf use in clinical therapy.",

                        "Gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells are a small subpopulation of T lymphocytes having the ability to bridge innate and adaptive immunity. The majority of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in adult human blood exhibit V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell receptors and respond to small phosphorylated nonpeptide antigens, called phosphoantigens (pAgs), which are commonly produced by malignant cells (see, e.g., Yang et al., Immunity 50, 1043-1053.e5 (2019)). Unlike conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells do not recognize polymorphic classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and are therefore free of graft versus host disease (GvHD) risk when adoptively transferred into an allogeneic host. Additionally, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have several other unique features that make them ideal cellular carriers for developing off-the-shelf cellular therapy for cancer. These features include: 1) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have roles in cancer immunosurveillance; 2) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have the remarkable capacity to target tumors independent of tumor antigen- and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restrictions; 3) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can employ multiple mechanisms to attack tumor cells through direct killing and adjuvant effects; and 4) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express a surface receptor, Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), that is involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and can be potentially combined with monoclonal antibody for cancer therapy (see, e.g., Lepore et al., Front. Immunol. 9, 1-11 (2018), Harrer et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 29, 547-558 (2018) and Presti et al., Front. Immunol. 8, 1-11 (2017)). Unfortunately, however, the development of an allogeneic off-the-shelf \u03b3\u03b4 T cellular product is greatly hindered by their availability\u2014these cells are of extremely low number and high variability in humans (\u02dc1-5% T cells in human blood), making it very difficult to produce therapeutic numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells using blood cells of allogeneic human donors (see, e.g., Silva-Santos et al., Nat. Rev. Immunol. 15, 683-691 (2015)).",
                        "The conventional method of generating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, in particular the V\u03b39V\u03b42 subset, for adoptive therapy involves either in vitro or in vivo expansion of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived \u03b3\u03b4 T cells using aminobisphosphonates, such as Zoledronate (ZOL). However, this methodology generates highly variable yields of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells depending on PBMC donors; and most importantly, such a \u03b3\u03b4 T cell product will typically contain bystander \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and thereby incurring GvHD risk (see, e.g., Torikai et al., Mol. Ther. 24, 1178-1186 (2016)).",
                        "Novel methods and materials that can reliably generate a homogenous monoclonal population of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells at large quantities with a feeder-free differentiation system are pivotal to developing off-the-shelf \u03b3\u03b4 T cell therapies that are useful in the treatment of a wide variety of pathological conditions."

Significantly, embodiments of these in vitro differentiated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be used for allogeneic \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d cell therapies for treating a broad range of diseases (e.g., cancers, autoimmune diseases, infections and the like).",

In certain embodiments, the method further comprises contacting the transduced cell with an agonist antigen or other stimulatory agent. In some embodiments of the invention, the method further comprises co-culturing the transduced cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, antigen presenting cells, or artificial antigen presenting cells. Certain embodiments of the invention further comprise expanding the pluripotent cell transduced with the nucleic acid molecule encoding a T cell receptor gamma chain polypeptide or a T cell receptor delta chain polypeptide in vitro. Alternative methods of the invention can comprise engrafting the cell transduced with the nucleic acid molecule encoding a T cell receptor gamma chain polypeptide and a T cell receptor delta chain polypeptide into a subject to generate clonal populations of the engineered cells in vivo.",

Unlike classical \u03b1\u03b2 T cells that recognize specific peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can recognize generic determinants expressed by cells that have become dysregulated as a result of either malignant transformation or viral infection. Consequently, \u03b3\u03b4-T cells have the innate ability to recognize and kill a broad spectrum of tumor cell types, in a manner that does not require the existence of conventional tumor-specific antigens.",

Such methods and materials can, for example, provide \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that can be used in allogeneic or autologous recipient subjects for the treatment of a variety of pathological conditions including, for example, viral infections, fungal infections, protozoal infections and cancers.",

As is known in the art, hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells possess multipotentiality, enabling them to self-renew and also to produce mature blood cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes. CD34 is a marker of human HSC, and all colony-forming activity of human bone marrow (BM) cells is found in the CD34+ fraction. See e.g., Mata et al., Transfusion. 2019 December; 59(12):3560-3569. doi: 10.1111/trf.15597.",

Notably, this lentivector mediated efficient expression of the human \u03b3\u03b4 TCR transgene in PBMC-T cells (FIG. 3B); the resulting transgenic human \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs responded to zoledronate (ZOL) stimulation, as evidenced by induced interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production (FIG. 3C) and enhanced tumor killing when co-culturing the transduced PBMC-T cells with human tumor cells (FIGS. 3D-3F).",

As shown in FIG. 4, to prove the possibility to generate HSC-engineered \u03b3\u03b4T cells in vivo, we isolated human CD34+ HSCs from G-CSF mobilized healthy donor PBMCs (denoted as PBSCs); transduced with Lenti/\u03b3\u03b4T vector then adoptively transferred this gene engineered HSCs into a BLT (bone marrow-liver-thymus) humanized mouse model. High numbers (e.g., over 15% of total blood cells) of human HSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cell were generated in mice and were detected in multiple tissues and organs over a period of 8 weeks. The high levels of transgenic HSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells were maintained long-term for over 6 months as long as the experiment ran.",

While autologous cell therapy has shown great promise in treating both blood cancers and solid tumors, it is endowed with several limitations. Autologous cells, in particular T cells collected from a patient is time consuming, logistically challenging, and costly; furthermore, patients who undergo heavily lymphopenic pretreatment might not always be possible to produce enough autologous cell products. Allogenic cell products that can be manufactured at large scale and distributed readily to treat a broad range of cancer patients are in great demand. As shown in FIG. 5, embodiments of the invention build on the HSC engineering approach and developed two in vitro culture method (feeder-dependent and feeder-independent cultures) to produce large number of off-the-shelf human \u03b3\u03b4T cells for allogeneic cell therapy applications.",
                        "FIG. 6 shows the generation of AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T Cells in A Feeder-Free Ex Vivo Differentiation Culture. As shown in FIG. 6. CD34+ HSCs isolated from G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood (denoted as PBSCs) or cord blood (denoted as CB HSCs) were transduced with a Lenti/\u03b3\u03b4T vector encoding a human \u03b3\u03b4 TCR gene, then put into the feeder-free ex vivo cell culture to generate AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells (FIGS. 6A and 6B). Both PBSCs and CB HSCs can effectively differentiate into and expand as transgenic AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells (FIGS. 6C and 6D). Similarly, AlloCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells can be generated by transducing the HSCs with a lentiviral vector encoding a human \u03b3\u03b4 TCR gene together with a CAR gene (FIG. 7). It is estimated that \u02dc1013 scale of AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells can be produced from either PBSCs of a healthy donor or HSCs of a CB sample, which can be formulated into 10,000-100,000 doses (at \u02dc108-109 cells per dose) (FIGS. 7A and 7B).

The phenotype and functionality of AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells were studied using flow cytometry (FIG. 8). Three controls were included: 1) endogenous human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that were isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood (denoted as PBMC-\u03b3\u03b4 T cells) and expanded in vitro with ZOL stimulation, identified as CD3+TCRV\u03b42+; 2) endogenous human conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells that were isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood (denoted as PBMC-T cells) and expanded in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, identified as CD3+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2+; and 3) endogenous human NK cells that were isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood (denoted as PBMC-NK cells) and expanded in vitro with K562 based artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) stimulation, identified as CD3\u2212-CD56+. AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells produced exceedingly high levels of multiple cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and Granzyme B), and expressed memory T cell marker CD27 and CD45RO, resembling that of endogenous \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (FIG. 8A). In addition, AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells expressed high level of NK activation receptors (e.g., NKG2D) and (e.g., DNAM-1) at levels similar to that of endogenous \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (FIG. 8B). Interestingly, AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells expressed higher levels of NKp30 and NKp44 (FIG. 8B) than that of endogenous \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which suggests that AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells may have enhanced NK-path tumor killing capacity stronger than that of endogenous \u03b3\u03b4 T and even endogenous NK cells.",
                        "FIG. 9 shows data from an in vitro Efficacy and MOA Study\u2014AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T Cells. One of the most attractive features of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is that they can attack tumors through multiple mechanisms including \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-mediated and NK receptor-mediated pathways. We therefore established an in vitro tumor cell killing assay to study such tumor killing capacities (FIG. 9A). Human tumor cell lines were engineered to overexpress the firefly luciferase (Fluc) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) dual reporters to enable the sensitive measurement of tumor cell killing using luminescence reading or flow cytometry assay. Multiple engineered human tumor cell lines were used in this study as target cells (FIG. 9E), including a melanoma cell line (A375), a multiple myeloma cell line (MM.1S), a lung cancer cell line (H292-FG), a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), a prostate cancer (PC3-FG), ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 and OVCAR8), a leukemia cell line (K562). As expected, the AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells effectively killed the tumor cells through NK pathway on their own and the tumor killing efficacies can be further enhanced by the addition of ZOL, indicating the presence of a \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-mediated killing mechanism (FIGS. 9B, 9C and 9D).",

As shown in FIG. 10, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor efficacy of AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells using a human ovarian cancer xenograft NSG mouse model. OVCAR3-FG tumor cells were intraperitoneally (i.p.) inoculated into NSG mice to form tumors, followed by an i.p. injection of PBMC-NK or AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells (FIG. 10A). AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth at an efficacy similar to or higher than that of PBMC-NK cells, as evidenced by time-course live animal bioluminescence imaging (BLI) monitoring (FIGS. 10B and 10C).",
                        "FIG. 11 shows data from an in in vitro Efficacy and MOA Study\u2014AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T Cells. As shown in FIG. 11, the tumor attacking potency of allogenic HSC-engineered B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting CAR armed \u03b3\u03b4T (AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T) cells were studied using the established in vitro tumor killing assay as previously described (FIG. 11A). Two human tumor cell lines were included in this study: 1) a human MM cell line, MM.1 S, which is BCMA+ and serves as a target of CAR-mediated killing; and 2) a human melanoma cell line, A375, which is BCMA\u2212 and serves as a negative control target of CAR-mediated killing. Both human tumor cell lines were engineered to overexpress the firefly luciferase (Fluc) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) dual reporters and the resulting MM.1S-FG and A375-FG cell lines were then utilized in the study. Similar to AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells, AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells killed BCMA\u2212 A375-FG cells at certain efficacy, presumably through a CAR-independent NK killing path; tumor killing efficacy was further enhanced in the presence of ZOL, likely through the addition of a gdTCR killing path (FIG. 11B). More importantly, when tested using the BCMA+ tumor line MM, AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells effectively killed tumor cells, at an efficacy better than that of HSC-\u03b3\u03b4T and comparable to that of the conventional BCAR-T cells (FIG. 11C). Taken together, these results provide evidence that AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells can target human tumor cells using three mechanisms: 1) CAR-dependent path, 2) \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-dependent path, and 3) NK path (FIG. 11D). This unique triple-targeting capacity of AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells is attractive, because it can potentially circumvent antigen escape, a phenomenon that has been reported in autologous CAR-T therapy clinical trials wherein tumor cells down-regulated their expression of CAR-targeting antigen to escape attack from CAR-T cells.",

As shown in FIG. 12, the in vivo antitumor efficacy of AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells was studied using an established MM.1S-FG xenograft NSG mouse model; conventional BCAR-T cells were included as a control. Under a low-tumor-load condition (FIG. 12A), AOBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells eliminated MM tumor cells as effectively as BCAR-T cells (FIGS. 12B and 12D); however, experimental mice treated with BCAR-T cells eventually died of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) despite being tumor-free, while experimental mice treated with AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells lived long-term with tumor-free and GvHD-free (FIG. 12C).",

As shown in FIG. 13, the in vivo antitumor efficacy of AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells in combination of ZOL treatment was also studied using an established MN.1S-FG xenograft NSG mouse model under a high-tumor-load condition. ZOL treatment was included to test a possible enhancement of antitumor efficacy of AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells through \u03b3\u03b4 TCR stimulation. AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells significantly suppressed tumor growth (FIG. 13A); ZOL treatment further enhanced the efficacy (FIGS. 13B-13D). This result suggests that combining with ZOL treatment may further enhance the antitumor efficacy of AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells. Because ZOL is a small molecule drug clinically available, the potential of a AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cell and ZOL combination therapy is feasible and attractive.",

IL-15 is a critical cytokine supporting the in vivo persistence and functionality of many immune cells including many subtypes of T cells and NK cells; we therefore studied the possible benefits of including IL-15 in the AlloBCAR-T cell product. A Lenti/BCAR-IL15-\u03b3\u03b4T lentivector was constructed to co-deliver the BCAR, IL-15, and \u03b3\u03b4 TCR genes (FIG. 14A). CB-derived CD34+ HSCs were transduced with the Lenti/BCAR-IL15-\u03b3\u03b4T vector, then put into the established feeder-free Ex Vivo HSC-\u03b3\u03b4T Differentiation Culture (FIG. 14A). Allo15BCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells were produced successfully, following a differentiation path and at a yield similar to that of the basic AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells (FIGS. 14A&14B). Importantly, compared to the basic AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells, the IL-15-enhanced Allo15BCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T cells showed significantly improved in vivo persistence, and when encountering pre-established MM tumors, showed significantly improved antitumor responses (e.g., in vivo clonal expansion; FIGS. 14C-14E).",
                        "FIG. 15 shows data from an Immunogenicity Study\u2014AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T and AlloBCAR-\u03b3\u03b4T Cells. As shown in FIG. 15, for allogeneic cell therapies, there are two immunogenicity concerns: a) Graft-versus-host (GvH) responses, and b) Host-versus-graft (HvG) responses. GvHD is a major safety concern. However, since \u03b3\u03b4 T cells do not react to mismatched HLA molecules and protein autoantigens, they are not expected to induce GvHD. This notion is evidenced by the lack of GvHD in human clinical experiences in allogeneic HSC transfer and autologous \u03b3\u03b4 T cell transfer and is supported by our in vitro mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) assay (FIG. 15A). Note that neither PBMC-\u03b3\u03b4 T cells nor AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells respond to allogenic PBMCs, in sharp contrast to that of the conventional PBMC-T cells (FIG. 15B). On the other hand, HvG risk is largely an efficacy concern, mediated through elimination of allogeneic therapeutic cells by host immune cells, mainly by conventional CD8 and CD4 \u03b1\u03b2 T cells which recognize mismatched HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. Indeed, in an In Vitro Mixed Lymphocyte Culture (MLC) assay (FIG. 15C), both conventional PBMC-T and PBMC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells triggered significantly responses from the PBMC-T cells of multiple mismatched donors (FIG. 15D). Interestingly, AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells showed reduced immunogenicity, likely attributes to their low expression levels of HLA-I/II (FIGS. 15E and 15F). Taken together, these results strongly support AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells as an ideal candidate for off-the-shelf cellular therapy that are GvHD-free and HvG-resistant.",
                        "FIG. 16 provides data from a comparison Study\u2014Unique Properties of AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T Cell Products. Existing methods generating human \u03b3\u03b4 T cell products mainly reply on expanding \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from human PBMCs. This culture method starts and ends up with a mixed cell population containing human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as well as other cells, in particular heterogeneous conventional up T (Tc) cells that may cause GvHD when transferred into allogeneic recipients (FIG. 16). As a result, this method requires a purification step to make \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d \u03b3\u03b4T cell products, in order to avoid GvHD. Herein, the AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cell culture is unique in two aspects: 1) It does not support the generation of randomly rearranged \u03b1\u03b2TCR recombinations to produce randomly rearranged endogenous \u03b1\u03b2TCRs, thereby no GvHD risk; 2) It supports the synchronized differentiation of transgenic AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells, thereby eliminating the presence of un-differentiated progenitor cells and other lineages of immune cells. As a result, the AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cell product is pure, homogenous, of no GvHD risk, and therefore no need in this methodology for a cell purification/sorting step.",

SARS-CoV-2 mainly enters a host human cell by binding to cell surface ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) using the virus spike (S) protein; we therefore used two ACE-2-positive human cells as target cells: one is a 293T human epithelial cell line engineered to overexpress ACE2, the other is a Calu-3 human lung epithelial cell line naturally expressed ACE2 (FIG. 17A, 13). These cell lines were further engineered to overexpress firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein dual-reporters (FG) to enable the sensitive measurement of cell viability using luminescence reading (FIG. 17A). The AlloHSC-\u03b3\u03b4T cells effectively killed both 293T-ACE2-FG and Calu-3-FG target cells with SARS-CoV-2 infection; target cell killing was not observed without virus infection (FIG. 17D).
