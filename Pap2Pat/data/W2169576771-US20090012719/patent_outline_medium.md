# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate gene expression analysis

## SUMMARY

- introduce cooperative interaction analysis
- describe factor selection methods
- describe gene selection methods
- describe systems for factor and gene selection

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce method for selecting factors from continuous data set
- identify factors cooperatively associated with outcome
- analyze factors for cooperative interactions
- apply to various data sets, including biological and financial data
- avoid limitations of discretization techniques
- evaluate continuous expression data
- define factors as features or outcomes
- select factors from data set of continuous measurements
- identify two or more factors jointly associated with outcome
- analyze each factor for cooperative interactions
- model cooperative interaction using Boolean function
- estimate uncertainty of predicting disease using conditional entropy
- evaluate entropy of cluster of samples
- apply UPGMA clustering algorithm
- calculate synergy of two genes
- generalize UPGMA method to more than two factors
- use one-step evaluation approach to estimate synergy
- modify membership values to reflect uncertainty
- assign weights to clusters based on membership values
- evaluate conditional entropy and synergy for multiple samples
- identify modules of genes with low conditional entropy or high synergy
- use modules to predict outcome of new sample
- implement techniques using software such as MATLAB or C++
- illustrate example of disclosed subject matter using prostate cancer data
