# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate gene expression analysis

## SUMMARY

- introduce cooperative interaction analysis
- summarize embodiments of factor selection methods

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce method for selecting factors from continuous data set
- describe application to disease data and other biological data
- discuss limitations of previous techniques, such as discretization
- define factors and outcomes in continuous data set
- describe method for evaluating conditional entropy and synergy
- introduce UPGMA clustering algorithm for evaluating synergy
- discuss alternative approach for evaluating synergy, one-step evaluation
- describe two methods for one-step evaluation approach
- discuss use of information gained from continuous expression data
- describe identification of modules and sub-modules of genes
- discuss implementation of techniques using software and hardware
- provide example of application to prostate cancer expression data
