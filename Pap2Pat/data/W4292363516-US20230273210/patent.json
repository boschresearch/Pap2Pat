                        "Heart transplantation is a recognized treatment option for patients with end stage heart failure. As organ availability is limited, it can be important to carefully assess the risk of transplant candidates to improve transplant outcomes and organ allocation.",
                        "Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after heart transplant can be defined as idiopathic heart failure occurring within the immediate postoperative period. PGD can affect either or both ventricles simultaneously and be graded from mild to severe depending on the amount of support required to compensate for organ dysfunction. PGD can cause the death of patients within 30 days after transplant.",
                        "The underlying cause of PGD and the importance of different factors towards post-transplant PGD remains unclear. Identifying predictive factors of PGD in recipients has the potential to improve risk stratification, organ allocation, and post-operative care as well as increase the understanding behind the etiology of PGD.",
                        "Improving the prediction of post-transplant survival can improve the use of available grafts and to better assess the risks and benefits of transplantation for high-risk patients. Tools that can accurately classify post-transplant risk have been developed for other solid organ transplants, such as kidney and lung, but similar efforts to predict post-transplant survival in heart transplantation have had limited success.",
                        "Circulating microvesicles are small vesicles that contain proteins, RNA, and DNA and play a role in intercellular communication throughout the body. The proteome of microvesicles, which can be purified and analyzed using mass spectrometry, has been shown to be a valuable resource for identifying novel biomarkers. Certain studies demonstrated the utility of microvesicle proteomics for predicting primary graft dysfunction before transplant and for diagnosing cellular and antibody-mediated rejection.",
                        "As such, there is a need in the art for improved techniques for predicting PGD, and techniques to overcome certain challenges due to the limitations of poor discrimination in external validation set and to outperform the current methods by expanding the pool of potential transplant biomarkers associated with transplant survival using macrovesicle proteomics."

                        "In non-limiting embodiments, clinical risk scores can include a plurality of risk factors for primary graft dysfunction (e.g., Right atrial pressure >=10 mm Hg, recipient Age>=60 years, Diabetes mellitus, Inotrope dependence, donor Age>=30 years, Length of ischemic time>=240 minutes\u2014i.e., RADIAL score).",
                        "In certain embodiments, the level of a PGD marker can be measured from the sample of the subject. In non-limiting embodiments, the PGD marker can include proteins peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), tropomyosin alpha-4 (TPM4), myeloperoxidase (MPO), PGLYRP2, DEFA1, DEFA1B, LDHB, F2, FCGBP, CAT, CFHR5, HIST1H4, GAPDH, LTF, ADIPOQ, HSPA5, plasma kallikrein (KLKB1), or combinations thereof. In non-limiting embodiments, the PGD marker can be KLKB1. In some embodiments, the method can further include measuring the level of the additional marker from the sample. The additional marker can include PRDX2, TPM4, MPO, PGLYRP2, DEFA1, DEFA1B, LDHB, F2, FCGBP, CAT, CFHR5, HIST1H4, GAPDH, LTF, ADIPOQ, HSPA5, KLKB1, IGHD, IGLV2-11, or combinations thereof.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the level of the PGD marker and/or additional maker can be measured through various assays. In non-limiting embodiments, the level of the PGD marker and/or additional maker can be measured using mass spectrometry analysis. For example, microvesicles can be isolated from a sample (e.g., 100 ul) from a subject and homogenized using an MS-compatible lysis buffer. Lysate (e.g., 20 \u03bcg) from each sample can be proteolytically cleaved with trypsin and chemically labeled with mass spectrometer detectable quantification reagent. A reference sample can be generated by pooling equal amounts of microvesicles from each subject to create a protein library for quantification. Samples can be bulk mixed (e.g., at 1:1) across all channels, and bulk mixed samples can be fractionated, and each fraction can be dried. Dried peptides can be dissolved in a solution of 2% acetonitrile/2% formic acid and injected (e.g., in Oribitrap Fusion coupled with the UltiMate\u2122 3000 RSLCnano system). Fractionated peptides can be separated with an about 5-30% acetonitrile gradient in about 0.1% formic acid over about 70 min. In non-limiting embodiments, the full MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of about 120,000. In some embodiments, the method can include selecting the most intense ions (e.g., MS1 ions) for MS2 analysis. MS1 can be the initial ionized sample. These ions can split into smaller fragments usually through collision to generate smaller ions (MS2) and so on (MS3). Each MS represents a greater fragmentation such that the their separation by mass/charge ratio allows to identify individual ions. The isolation width can be set at about 0.7 Da, and isolated precursors can be fragmented by Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) at normalized collision energy (NCE) of 35% and analyzed in the ion trap using \u201cturbo\u201d scan speed. Following the acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, a synchronous precursor selection (SPS) MS3 scan can be collected on the selected ions (e.g., the top 10 most intense ions in the MS2 spectrum). SPS-MS3 precursors can be fragmented by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) at an normalized collision energy (NCE) of 60% and analyzed. Raw mass spectrometric data can be analyzed using to perform database search and tandem mass tags (TMT) reporter ions quantification. TMT can be isobaric mass tags that can allow for quantitation of each protein identified in mass spec. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (e.g., +229.163 Da) and the carbamidomethylating of cysteine residues (e.g., +57.021 Da) can be set as static modifications, while the oxidation of methionine residues (e.g., +15.995 Da), deamidation (+0.984) on asparagine and glutamine can be set as a variable modification. In non-limiting embodiments, data can be searched against a predetermined database (e.g., a UniProt human database) with peptide-spectrum match (PSMs) and protein-level at 1% false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR can be a multiple hypothesis correction that quantifies the rate of false discoveries or false positive predictions. The signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of each protein can be normalized so that the sum of the signal for all proteins in each channel can be equivalent to account for equal protein loading. In certain embodiments, the level of the PGD marker and/or additional maker can be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays. For example, ELISA assay can be used to assess PGD maker/additional PGD marker (e.g., KLKB1 protein) concentrations. The ELISA and mass spectrometry-derived protein expression can be compared through the minimum-maximum normalized patient cohort data. The obtained results can be further analyzed for protein expression analysis.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the method can include performing protein expression analysis. For example, the difference in protein expression distributions between the prospective and retrospective cohorts can be evaluated (e.g., with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test). The protein expression distribution deviation from the normality test can be from D'Agostino's and Pearson's test, where the normality of a distribution can be rejected at an alpha level p-value. In some embodiments, a differential protein expression signature between PGD and non-PGD patient samples can be calculated. To estimate the association of individual protein levels to PGD, L1-regularized logistic regression models can be calculated for each protein with the sites-of-origin as covariates. For example, about 200 bootstraps (samples with replacement) of the models can be performed to determine a confidence interval for the protein expression association to PGD. The average of the bootstrap distribution for each protein can be used as the differential rank statistic.",
                        "In certain embodiments, pathway analysis can be conducted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). For GSEA, the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) can provide a gene set enrichment compared to all permutations of the gene set enrichment for the protein expression data. The NES can be interpreted as the gene set enrichment score corrected for the size of the gene set and spurious, uninteresting correlations between the gene sets and the expression dataset. The p-value can estimate the probability of seeing an enrichment score as high or higher among the permutation distribution, and the false discovery rate (FDR) can estimate the probability that an enrichment score with a given NES is a false positive finding.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the protein prediction contribution can be assessed within each of the pathways and functions from the GSEA analysis. The set of proteins within each pathway and function can be used as features in an L1-regularized logistic regression model (e.g., using a Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) model). For example, if a given pathway A includes a set of 5 proteins, then those 5 proteins can be included as features in the L1-regularized logistic regression model, given the sites-of-origin as covariates.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the method can include providing a PGD risk value that can be quantified based on the level of the PGD marker using an adaptive MCCV model. The PGD marker, additional PGD markers, characteristics of the subject, or combinations thereof can be used for calculating the PGD risk value. For example, a Logistic Regression model with L1 regularization for each marker to determine their predictive performance and association to PGD. To estimate the prediction variance and PGD risk value, the MCCV can be used.

PGD can affect either or both ventricles simultaneously and be graded from mild to severe depending on the amount of compensatory support required. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation reported that PGD is the leading cause of death within 30 days after transplant. Identifying predictive factors of PGD has the potential to improve risk stratification, organ allocation, and post-operative care, as well as increase the understanding of the etiology of PGD. However, a risk model based solely on pre-transplant recipient factors remains elusive.",

Whole serum was used for KLKB1 ELISA to test the feasibility of a clinical test without microvesicle purification. Patients who had RV PGD or mechanical support for reasons other than PGD were excluded from the analysis. Potentially due to the small number of severe PGD (n=3), there was no significant difference in average KLKB1 levels when comparing patients with severe PGD to no PGD levels (Mann-Whitney U test 19.81\u00b16.248 vs 45.796\u00b132.54 p-value=0.0511).

The 200 bootstrap distribution produces a confidence interval for PGD population risk for each marker. The average of each distribution is the population risk value for that marker. In the case of using protein markers, the collection of the population risk values is the differential expression signature towards primary graft dysfunction. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate enriched pathways and functions from the differential protein signature. 6 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 11; FDR<0.2), and 3 pathways were depleted in patients with PGD (Table 12; FDR<0.2; FIG. 12A).",

As shown in the principal components analysis, cohort site of origin explains protein expression variation for patients and thus is included as a covariate in association and prediction analyses.

The marker prediction specifications did not include site-of-origin as covariates in order to easily translate the putative classifier equations to new patient data. However, when covariate adjustment was included, the average AUROC performance is highly correlated with the unadjusted performances suggesting minimal confounding by site and accuracy of the classifier equations to translate onto new patient data agnostic of site.

Machine learning and statistical techniques were used to mitigate confounding in biological enrichment analyses and improve predictive accuracy with modest population size. Reduction in KLKB1 was the strongest predictor of PGD both by itself and in combination with other markers. KLKB1 is a serine protease that controls the activation of both inflammation and coagulation in what is known as the kallikrein-kinin-system (KKS). In the inflammatory response, KLKB1 converts high molecular weight kininogen into bradykinin, stimulating the release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. It also acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant, causing degranulation. Evaluations of the KKS system in patients with sepsis, a markedly inflammatory state, demonstrated increased KKS activity, characterized by decreased levels of plasma kallikrein, likely due to consumption. Decreases in KLKB1 have been noted in typhoid fever, ARDS, cardiopulmonary bypass and in normal volunteers infused with gram-negative endotoxin. Similarly, in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis, plasma kallikrein levels were markedly reduced.",

Similarly, enrichment analysis of protein expression differences demonstrated several upregulated biological processes, including inflammatory and immune pathways in patients prior to PGD. Laboratory tests in the validation cohort trended towards increased inflammation though were not significant. It remains to be seen whether this inflammatory signature is purely a bio-marker or contributes to PGD and, importantly, whether modifying this state can have an impact on the evolution of PGD.",

Pre-transplant inotrope therapy and durable mechanical support (such as LVAD) were exclusive prior to transplant, and mechanical support has been associated with PGD in prior studies. However, mechanical support was not significantly predictive of PGD in the analyses and did not interact with inotrope therapy in prediction models. Whether inotrope therapy itself is an actual driver of PGD protection versus an epiphenomenal marker remains to be explored. There were clear differences in medical therapy, anticoagulation and mechanical support between patients receiving and not receiving inotrope therapy (Table 13).",

The ELISA samples themselves were not able to generate a classifier using KLKB1 and inotrope therapy due to the paucity of PGD samples in that cohort. However, the proteomics-derived classifier generated a similar AUROC on whole serum as it did in the original microvesicle proteomic cohort. At the whole serum level, in a population whose incidence mirrored closely to national PGD rates, the classifier performed essentially as a rule-out test with a very high negative predictive value.",

With only 3 cases of severe PGD in this cohort, which approximates the normal incidence of PGD, KLKB1 trended towards a significant decrease in PGD patients (p=0.051). Looking forward to clinical utility, PGD risk stratification can be served in the outpatient setting as part of an overall pre-transplant evaluation. The disclosed subject matter can be used for understanding if the patient risk is static or evolves and whether changes in that risk were associated with clinical status. The optimistic potential here is to use this classifier to evaluate therapies that can alter future PGD risk and improve heart transplant outcomes.",

The statistics generated by the GSEA algorithm is detailed in their online user guide. Briefly, the Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) provides a gene set enrichment compared to all permutations of the gene set enrichments for the protein expression data. The NES can be interpreted as the gene set enrichment score corrected for the size of the gene set and spurious, un-interesting correlations between the gene sets and the expression dataset. The p-value estimates the probability of seeing an enrichment score as high or higher among the permutation distribution, and the false discovery rate (FDR) estimates the probability that an enrichment score with a given NES is a false positive finding.

Within each of the 200 randomized training/validation data splits, a tenfold cross validation (within the training set only) was used to optimize model parameters and perform feature selection (3). Using the chosen parameters and features, the entire training set (4) was trained and this model used to predict survival status on the validation set (5). The survival prediction probabilities were compared to the true survival status to compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and other metrics. The AUROC values reported in this paper were calculated using the validation set patient probabilities. Bootstrapping analysis on the validation patient probabilities (N=50 samples with replacement) resulted in a population distribution for prediction performances, and feature importance (beta coefficient) was extracted within each bootstrap before prediction on the validation set.",

Comparison of the bootstrap and permutation prediction distributions allows for prediction and feature importance comparisons between real and randomly distributed data while accounting for over-fitting during these prediction tasks. The significance of each marker to predict patient survival was evaluated by comparing the 200 feature importance values from the bootstrap and the permutation prediction distributions. The p-values generated in this comparison represent protein marker prediction in the cohort compared with random patient survival.

Though this analysis is agnostic to the cause of death, the prevalence of PGD in this cohort raises the question of whether the predictive performance of the proteins is in some way linked to PGD. To ascertain this, the analysis was performed accounting for PGD status as a covariate, where all predictive proteins had higher performance (AUROC>0.71) when accounting for PGD, demonstrating that prediction was not dependent on PGD status (Table 17).
