                        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions are often treated using disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs (anti-TNFs). While such treatment regimens are effective for many patients, they can cause serious side effects and still prove ineffective for a large number of patients\u2014it is estimated that up to one third of RA patients do not respond to their first anti-TNF drug. Patients who do not respond are often prescribed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can cause addiction and other dangerous side effects.",
                        "There has been recent rapid growth and attention in the field known as electroceuticals or bioelectronics medicine in which peripheral nerves (e.g., vagus nerve) and end-organs (i.e. organs at the terminal end of a nerve conduction pathway) are stimulated to treat a wide range of health disorders. For example, there are recent studies showing that invasive vagus nerve stimulation can treat rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and many other health conditions such as tinnitus, depression, seizures, etc. There are also studies showing that activity within the spleen is a critical component for eliciting an anti-inflammatory effect that is modulated by the vagus nerve and is involved with treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, and liver damage, as well as implications for cancer/tumor treatment and stroke recovery.",
                        "The vagus nerve does not work in isolation of the spleen and the spleen does not work in isolation of the swollen joints/limbs. Although vagus nerve stimulation has promise, applying electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve is complex since current can flow in uncontrollable ways through the tissue and the vagus nerve is involved with many functions of the body, even life sustaining functions such as heart rate. Accessing cells within these end-organs with electrical implants is also challenging, not only to implant chips into those regions, but also to be able to target specific regions. And yet there remains a need for an effective noninvasive treatment that does not include the side effects of conventional drugs, since rheumatoid arthritis affects nearly \u02dc1% of the world population. If other arthritis types are included in such a solution along with autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, potentially hundreds of millions of people could benefit."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Systems and methods are provided for coordinated noninvasive neuromodulation. Ultrasound stimulation may be applied to the spleen and/or to the joints, limbs, or other region experiencing pain that has local swelling, combined with electrical stimulation of the neck, face, or other body region in appropriately-timed patterns to drive therapeutic effects for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The coordinated or combined ultrasound and electrical stimulation approach exploits natural body functions where these different pathways and local regions are being activated in coordinated ways to achieve healing effects. The systems and methods in the present disclosure mimic these more natural processes to provide for more enhanced healing than could be provided by non-coordinated stimulation or with either stimulation alone. Simply artificially stimulating just the vagus nerve over and over again or just the spleen over and over again is expected to have substantially suboptimal effects because different components of the body do not naturally work in isolation but are interconnected and require co-activation in appropriately timed patterns for synergetic and enhanced outcomes.",
                        "Neuromodulation techniques of the present disclosure have the potential to directly modulate cells in the spleen or end-organs. These techniques may also replace drug treatments for many health disorders and reduce side effects. The larger population of RA patients who receive effective treatments using anti-TNFs may also supplement their drug treatment regimen with the present systems and methods for noninvasive ultrasound and electrical stimulation in order to reduce or minimize unwanted side effects.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1, a flow chart is provided depicting non-limiting example steps for coordinated ultrasound and electrical stimulation. A location for ultrasound stimulation may be determined at step 110. Non-limiting examples of determining an ultrasound location include: selecting a position on a subject for placing a body-worn ultrasound device, selecting a position on a subject for placing a conventional ultrasound probe, or adjusting the ultrasound stimulation target on or within the spleen as described below, such as by using beam steering. In some configurations, the method may be implemented on or by a computer system.",
                        "A location for electrical stimulation may be determined at step 120. The location may be determined based upon access or proximity to a peripheral nerve, vagus nerve, trigeminal nerve, or other nerves. In some configurations, the location for noninvasive electrical stimulation (EStim) may be determined to be on the surface of the face, neck, ear, or other body region to modulate the vagus nerve pathways to the spleen and brain that can further treat a subject's condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In some configurations, the electrical stimulation may be delivered by a body-worn device or patch that may be left in place on the subject for extended periods of time while delivering treatment. The location for the electrical stimulation may be partly based upon how the device or patch may be physically placed on a subject. The location of stimulation can be adjusted, for example, based on the ability to modify heart rate or the ability to elicit the largest evoked potentials based on EEG recordings that can localize brainstem regions receiving projections from vagus nerve or trigeminal nerve pathways. In some configurations, multiple electrical stimulation devices may be placed at different locations on a subject, and which electrical stimulator is activated or used may be based upon feedback from the results of the ultrasound stimulation.",
                        "Timing delays for coordinated ultrasound and electrical stimulation may be determined at step 130. These timing delays between the coordinated ultrasound and electrical stimulations may be optimized for a desired clinical effect, such as to reduce inflammation in the subject. In some configurations, the delay timings may take into account the physical size of a patient, the transit time or the speed of the signal from the ultrasound or electrical stimulations to a desired location, and the like. The timing may also be tailored for the specific disease being treated or the severity of the disease in the individual patient, based on the desired duration or required intensity of the targeted anti-inflammatory state. In one configuration, stimulation by either electrical and/or ultrasound to their respective locations and then measuring the signal received at the other location and the time it takes for that signal to be received may be used for determining the timing delay. In some configurations, a heart rate of a subject may be measured to determine an optimal timing delay based upon a previous stimulation. Timing delays may range between 0 to 1000 ms between locations. In one configuration, a timing delay may be less than 100 ms. As shown in FIG. 4A, more effective therapy for treating inflammation in mice occurred when using a delay of 50 ms or lower in which much longer delays such as 300 ms was not effective. These data demonstrate that appropriate delays between ultrasound and electrical stimulation are critical for treatment efficacy. The large dimensions of the human body can benefit from a larger range of delays including several hundred milliseconds up to 1000 ms.",
                        "Optimized stimulation parameters may be determined at step 140. Optimized stimulation parameters may be determined based upon the desired clinical outcome and/or the timing delays desired, as described above, and may allow for custom parameters for each subject or clinical treatment. For ultrasound stimulation, optimized stimulation parameters may include determining duty cycle, frequency, pressure, duration, beam focus, pulse pattern, and the like. In some configurations, ultrasound at 1 MHz with a 1 s on and 5 s off pattern may be effective at \u02dc350 kPa, as shown in FIG. 4A. In other configurations, ultrasound stimulation may be below 1 MHz. In a non-limiting example, ultrasound stimulation may be 500 kHz. For electrical stimulation pulses, optimized parameters may include current, voltage, frequency, duration, phase, pulse pattern, and the like. In some configurations, electrical stimulation of 1 mA at 1 Hz may be effective for treatment, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4A. In other configurations, electrical stimulation may be in the range of 25-30 Hz for effective treatment. In additional configurations, electrical stimulation of 500 \u03bcA may be effective for treatment. Stimulations may be repeated for up to 30-60 minutes per day. In some configurations, stimulation times may be conducted for 2 minutes at a time, 12 minutes at a time, as in FIG. 4A, or until a desired clinical result is achieved, such as the reduction of inflammation measured for a subject. In other configurations, stimulation may be provided continually by devices worn by the subject. Other parameters, such as timing between modalities, may also be used for optimal therapy.",
                        "Non-limiting example ultrasound stimulation parameters are listed in Table 1 below. Table 1 includes expanded and optimized parameter ranges. Non-limiting example electrical stimulation parameters are also listed in Table 2 below. Table 2 similarly includes expanded and optimized parameter ranges.",
                        "In some configurations, optimized stimulation parameters include optimized stimulation pulse patterns. Non-limiting example pulse patterns for ultrasound include 16.7% duty cycle with 1 s on and 5 s off, a 50% duty cycle with 500 ms on and 500 ms off, a 35% duty cycle with 350 ms on and 650 ms off, or any range of pulse pattern timing and duty cycles between these parameters and any combination thereof. Any suitable pulse pattern may be used, such as an unmodulated burst of pulses, sinusoid modulated pulse trains, chirp pulses, spike pulses, and the like. Some non-limiting example electrical signal pulse patterns and waveforms are listed in Table 3 below.",
                        "Coordinated ultrasound and electrical stimulation may be applied to a subject at step 150 using the determined timing delays and optimized parameters as described above. The coordinated stimulation may be adjusted to compensate for target or subject motion in step 160, or to take into consideration other changes that may occur. The process of determining stimulation parameters and delivering a coordinated ultrasound and electrical stimulation to a subject may be repeated as indicated by pathway 170. Non-limiting examples of repeatedly determining optimal parameters and providing stimulation include repeating the process for each stimulation, for a determined number of stimulations, as triggered by a change such as target motion, or as determined by a user.",
                        "FIG. 2A illustrates an example of an ultrasound system 200 that can be used to implement the methods described in the present disclosure. The ultrasound system 200 includes a transducer array 202 that includes a plurality of separately-driven transducer elements 204. The transducer array 202 can include any suitable ultrasound transducer array, including linear arrays, curved arrays, phased arrays, and so on. Similarly, the transducer array 202 can include a 1D transducer, a 1.5D transducer, a 1.75D transducer, a 2D transducer, a 3D transducer, and so on.",
                        "When energized by a transmitter 206, a given transducer element 204 produces a burst of ultrasonic energy. The ultrasonic energy reflected back to the transducer array 202 (e.g., an echo) from the object or subject under study is converted to an electrical signal (e.g., an echo signal) by each transducer element 204 and can be applied separately to a receiver 208 through a set of switches 210. The transmitter 206, receiver 208, and switches 210 are operated under the control of a controller 212, which may include one or more processors. As one example, the controller 212 can include a computer system.",
                        "The transmitter 206 can be programmed to transmit unfocused or focused ultrasound waves. In some configurations, the transmitter 206 can also be programmed to transmit diverged waves, spherical waves, cylindrical waves, plane waves, or combinations thereof. Furthermore, the transmitter 206 can be programmed to transmit spatially or temporally encoded pulses.",
                        "The receiver 208 can be programmed to implement a suitable detection sequence for the imaging task at hand. In some embodiments, the detection sequence can include one or more of line-by-line scanning, compounding plane wave imaging, synthetic aperture imaging, and compounding diverging beam imaging.",
                        "In some configurations, the transmitter 206 and the receiver 208 can be programmed to implement a high frame rate. For instance, a frame rate associated with an acquisition pulse repetition frequency (\u201cPRF\u201d) of at least 100 Hz can be implemented. In some configurations, the ultrasound system 200 can sample and store at least one hundred ensembles of echo signals in the temporal direction.",
                        "The controller 212 can be programmed to implement an imaging sequence using the techniques described in the present disclosure, or as otherwise known in the art. In some embodiments, the controller 212 receives user inputs defining various factors used in the design of the imaging sequence.",
                        "A scan can be performed by setting the switches 210 to their transmit position, thereby directing the transmitter 206 to be turned on momentarily to energize transducer elements 204 during a single transmission event according to the designed imaging sequence. The switches 210 can then be set to their receive position and the subsequent echo signals produced by the transducer elements 204 in response to one or more detected echoes are measured and applied to the receiver 208. The separate echo signals from the transducer elements 204 can be combined in the receiver 208 to produce a single echo signal.",
                        "In some configurations, ultrasound system 200 may include more than one ultrasound array 202. At least one of the arrays may be used for transmitting ultrasound for therapeutic treatment, and at least one other array may be used to transmit and/or receive ultrasound for imaging. In one non-limiting example, the frequency used for treatment may be lower than the frequency used to produce high-quality images.",
                        "The echo signals are communicated to a processing unit (not shown), which may be implemented by a hardware processor and memory, to process echo signals or images generated from echo signals. As a non-limiting example, the processing unit can target the spleen for ultrasound stimulation to treat inflammation using the methods described in the present disclosure. Images produced from the echo signals by the processing unit can be displayed on a display system 214.",
                        "In one non-limiting example, a wearable/miniaturized phased array ultrasound device may be used for ultrasound system 200. The wearable device may be placed on a subject and worn for extended periods of time. In some configurations, a reprogrammed smartphone or tablet device may be used to control and/or monitor the stimulation. In one non-limiting example, the reprogrammed smartphone or tablet device may allow for Bluetooth wireless control of the stimulation device. In some configurations, the control and/or monitor system may be an application installed on a smartphone, tablet device, and the like. In another non-limiting example, a number of devices distributed around a subject may be used to provide the ultrasound stimulation. The overall size of a wearable device may be similar to that of other consumer electronic wearable devices, such as smart watches, when using miniaturized ultrasound array technology. In one non-limiting example, the total footprint of a device may be less than 1.2 cm\u00d71.2 cm. In another non-limiting example, the footprint of a device may be less than 40\u00d740 mm. In some non-limiting examples, the total footprint of the device may be larger, such as to cover a larger region of the spleen or other organ. In one non-limiting example, the footprint of the device is the same size as a spleen, which may range from 8-16 cm.",
                        "In some configurations, the ultrasound transducer elements 204 can be activated in unison to form a plane wave front. In other configurations, the ultrasound transducer elements 204 can be activated sequentially to form an angled or focused wave front.",
                        "In some configurations, beam steering may be used to target selected locations on or in the spleen with ultrasound stimulation. Locations may be selected to optimize the effects of treatment, such as by targeting neural pathways within the spleen. Optimized effects may include modulating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory immune reflex circuit to decrease a subject's inflammation and treat rheumatoid arthritis. This anti-inflammatory reflex pathway involves circuits in the brain (e.g., medulla oblongata Cl neuron activation and hypothalamic-pituitary responses) that project via the vagus nerve to the spleen as well as reciprocal pathways back to the brain, coordinating the immune response of the body.",
                        "In some configurations, a wearable energy delivery device will have the capability to image and transmit ultrasound energy to a specified target. Imaging and/or beam steering may also be used to compensate for motion of the spleen, such as changes in depth due to subject motion. The spleen naturally moves in the abdominal cavity during heavy breathing and changes in body position. With imaging feedback, the ultrasound beam focus point can be realigned as the distance to the surface of the spleen changes relative to the transducer array. This provides the potential for closed-loop device operation with the implementation of automated re-targeting algorithms. One non-limiting example of an ultrasound device capable of both imaging and stimulation includes a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (pMUT).",
                        "To accomplish a beam steered scan, the transmitter 206 imparts a time delay, Ti, to the respective pulses 216 that are applied to successive transducer elements 204. If the time delay is zero, Ti=0, all of the transducer elements 204 will be energized simultaneously and the resulting ultrasonic beam will be directed along an axis 218 normal to the face of the transducer 202 and originating from the center of the transducer array 202. As the time delay increment, Ti, is increased, the ultrasonic beam is directed away from the central axis 218 by an angle, \u03b8. The relationship between the time delay increment, Ti, added successively to each ith signal from one end of the transducer array 202, i=1, to the other end, i=n, is given by the following relationship:",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{T_{i} = {T_{0} + {\\left( {i - \\frac{\\left( {n - 1} \\right)}{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{{S \\cdot \\sin}\\;(\\theta)}{c} \\right)} + {\\left( {i - \\frac{\\left( {n - 1} \\right)}{2}} \\right)^{2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{S^{2} \\cdot {\\cos\\left( {2\\theta} \\right)}}{2Rc} \\right)}}};} & (1)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "where S is an equal spacing between centers of adjacent transducer elements 204; c is the velocity of sound in the object under study; R is a range, or depth, at which the transmit beam is to be focused; and T0 is a delay offset that insures that all calculated time delay increment values, Ti, are positive values.",
                        "The second term in Eqn. (1) steers the beam to the desired angle, \u03b8, and the third term is employed when the transmitted beam is to be focused at a fixed range, R. A sector scan is performed by progressively changing the time delays, in successive excitations. In this manner, the angle, \u03b8, is changed in increments to steer the transmitted beam in a succession of directions. When the direction of the beam is above the central axis 218, the timing of the pulses is reversed; however, Eqn. (1) still applies in this situation.",
                        "The echo signals produced by each burst of ultrasonic energy emanate from reflecting objects located at successive ranges, or depths, R, along the ultrasonic beam. These are sensed separately by each transducer element 204 in the transducer array 202, and a sample of the magnitude of each echo signal at a particular point in time represents the amount of reflection occurring at a specific range, R. Due to the differences in the propagation paths between a focal point, P, and each transducer element 204, however, these echo signals will not occur simultaneously and their amplitudes will not be equal. A function of the receiver 208 is to amplify and demodulate these separate echo signals, impart the proper time delay to each, and sum them together to provide a single echo signal that accurately indicates the total ultrasonic energy reflected from each focal point, P, located at successive ranges, R, along the ultrasonic beam oriented at the angle, \u03b8.",
                        "Under the direction of the digital controller 212, the receiver 208 provides delays during the scan such that the steering of the receiver 208 tracks with the direction of the beam steered by the transmitter 206, and such that the receiver 208 samples the echo signals at a succession of ranges, R, and provides the proper delays to dynamically focus at points, P, along the beam. Thus, each emission of an ultrasonic pulse results in the acquisition of a series of data points that represent the amount of reflected sound from a corresponding series of points, P, located along the ultrasonic beam.",
                        "In some configurations a physical device, such as a cone, may be used to steer the ultrasound beam to the target location. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that other options for directing ultrasound to a target location may be used with the present disclosure.",

Ultrasound was noninvasively applied to the spleen daily using a single US transducer. Disease progression was monitored daily by measuring ankle thickness, weight, and clinical disease score.
