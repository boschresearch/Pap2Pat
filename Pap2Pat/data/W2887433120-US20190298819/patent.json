                                "WNV is a mosquito-borne member of the family Flaviviridae that has emerged in recent years to become a serious public health threat. The virus was initially identified in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937, and has since spread worldwide. The virus was first identified in North America in the United States in 1999, and has since spread into Canada, Mexico, as well as central and South America. Following introduction into North America, the number of WNV cases increased steadily as the virus spread geographically; in 2003, almost 10,000 cases were reported in the U.S., with 264 deaths. Cumulatively between 1999 and 2010 there have been over 780,000 symptomatic cases of WNV in the U.S. Of these, 16,000 have resulted in neurologic disease, and over 1500 have been fatal. During the 2012 reporting season, the United States reported the second highest number of WNV cases since the outbreak began, with 5674 total cases reported, compared to only 712 cases in 2011. The number of cases per year continues to average greater than 2000 since 2012; however, the location with the most cases varies year to year. Importantly, recent WNV outbreaks have been characterized by an increased number of serious neurological or fatal complications compared to earlier outbreaks. Serious complications from WNV infection are the result of spread of the virus into the central nervous system (CNS), and can result in meningitis, paralysis, and eventually death. Infection of the kidneys has also been reported, although the significance of this and contribution to virus induced morbidity remains unclear. While reasons for the recent increase in severe neurologic cases are unclear, the continued geographic spread and consistent seasonal outbreaks of WNV highlight the need for development of effective vaccines.",
                                "WNV (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus, with a genome that encodes 3 structural and 7 non-structural proteins as a single polypeptide that then co- and post translationally processed to yield the 10 proteins. The 3 virus structural proteins are the capsid (C) protein, pre-membrane protein (prM) which is cleaved during virus maturation to yield the membrane (M) protein and envelope (E) protein. The E protein contains the receptor binding and fusion functions of the virus, and an X-Ray crystal structure for the WNV-E protein, as well as many other members of the genus, have been determined. Like all flavivirus E proteins, the WNV E-protein can be divided into three distinct structural domains; DI, DII, and DIII. Antibodies to domains DII, and DIII have been shown to neutralize the virus, and are correlated with resolution of infection in preclinical models. For this reason, the E-protein has been extensively evaluated as a vaccine candidate in both preclinical animal models. WNV E protein antigen has been delivered as part of an inactivated virus, a recombinant protein, as a DNA vaccine, as an RNA vaccine, and using various replicating and non-replicating viral vectors. Live-attenuated vaccines for WNV have also been developed. Of these, live attenuated vaccines have shown promise in the clinic, inducing high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies. However, due to the potential for persistent viremia in vaccines, these vaccines have important safety concerns, particularly in older or immunocompromised patients who are at high risk for neurologic complications. A recombinant E subunit vaccine, WN-80E, has also been advanced into the clinic, but was found to induce low level neutralizing antibodies when adsorbed to Alhydrogel adjuvant.",
                                "Vaccine adjuvants are critical for the effective development of protective responses with many antigens. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist adjuvants are particularly promising, as they engage the innate immune system to stimulate a more robust and durable adaptive immune response. Ligands for TLR 7/8 (Imiquimod, Resiquimod), TLR-9 (CpG), TLR-5 (Flagellin), and TLR-4 have been evaluated pre-clinically as components of vaccine adjuvants. TLR-9 and TLR-5 have been specifically evaluated in combination with WNV E protein or domain III antigens, and have shown promise in enhancing immunogenicity in mouse models, However, the safety and scalability of these TLR-agonists may make their use in the clinic problematic. TLR-4 agonist adjuvants, in contrast, have been shown to be safe and effective in several clinical trials, and the TLR-4 agonist adjuvant MPL is a component of the licensed HPV vaccine Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium).",
                                "A need exists for additional WNV vaccines that are safe for use in human subjects while exhibiting increased immunogenicity and durability in order to be sufficiently efficatious."

                        "The present invention is based on the determination that the immunogenicity and protective capacity of a vaccine including a WNV recombinant E-protein (WN-80E) is improved by use with a combination of TLR-4 agonist and saponin adjuvants. Using a model of WNV disease, the present invention is based on the finding that combining a TLR-4 agonist and a saponin adjuvant, a stable oil-in-water emulsion (SE) or liposomes provides both dose and dosage sparing functions and increased durabilty of the immune resposne over time, whereby protection can be induced after a single immunization containing, less than 10 \u03bcg of WN-80E. Furthermore, the TLR-4 agaoinst and QS21 adjuvant components can be used a low levels, less than 10 \u03bcg each, to induce a potent and durable immune response. Additionally, examination of immunological readouts suggest that induction of a class switched IgG2c antibody response is responsible for the enhance immune responses observed. These findings suggest that inclusion of the appropriate adjuvant combination at low levels greatly enhances the protective capacity of WNV recombinant subunit vaccines, and establish a baseline for future development of these adjuvant combinations.",
                        "The WNV vaccine of the present invention utilizes the WN-80E recombinant subunit protein that is produced by means of a cell culture expression system that is based on Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 20120141520 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The use of this system results in recombinant envelope subunit proteins that maintain native-like structure. The WNV recombinant envelope protein is truncated at the C-terminus, leaving 80% of the native envelope protein (\u201c80E\u201d). Thus WN-80E is defined as approximately the first 80% of consecutive amino acids of E starting at the first N-terminal amino acid. The C-terminal truncation is designed to delete the membrane anchor portion of the WN E protein (approximately 50 amino acids or 10% from the carboxy terminal end of the full length E protein), in other words, up to the first 90% of consecutive amino acids of WN E protein starting at amino acid 1 of its N-terminus, thus allowing it to be secreted into the extracellular medium and facilitating recovery. More than 90%, but less than 100%, of the E protein can be cloned and secreted, i.e., the protein can be 90%+ in length, carboxy truncated, and can include a portion of the membrane spanning domain so long as the truncated E protein is secretable. \u201cSecretable\u201d means the ability to be secreted, and typically secreted, from the transformed cells of the expression system. The 80E truncation further deletes the \u201cstem\u201d portion of the WN E protein that links the ectodomain of E with the membrane anchor portion. The stem portion does not contain notable antigenic epitopes and therefore is not included.",
                        "In one embodiment, the antigen for inclusion in the WNV vaccine is WN-80E. The WN-80E recombinant subunit protein expressed in the Drosophila S2 expression system is secreted into the culture medium, is properly glycosylated, and maintains native-like conformation as determined by reactivity with the conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibody 4G2.",
                        "The vaccine formulation of the present invention further includes a combination of TLR-4 agonist and saponin adjuvants. The use of this combination of adjuvants with the WN-80E antigen specifically results in a potent and durable immune response that has not been achieved by other adjuvant formulations. Furthermore, this combination of adjuvants allows for the WN-80E vaccine to be administered as a single dose that is capable of producing a protective response.",
                        "An ideal TLR-4 agonist is a fully synthetic lipid A molecule (SLA). The most commonly used TLR-4 agonist used for vaccines is monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). MPL is prepared from bacterial cell walls. The processes used result in heterogeneous preparations of MPL. The synthetic nature of SLA provides for more defined composition relative to MPL. Furthermore, the structure of SLA has been optimized to bind more effectively to the human TLR-4 receptor. SLA enhances the ability of the immune system to respond to vaccine antigens.",
                        "An ideal saponin adjuvant is a highly purified preparation derived from the Soap bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) and contains a water soluble triterpene glucoside molecule.

Typically, if multiple immunizations are given, they will be given one to two months apart. For the vaccine of the invention it is preferable to administer a single dose. To further boost the immune response, a second dose of vaccine can be administered. The preferred immunization schedule for two doses is 0 and 1 months. Other immunizations schedules can also be utilized. For example, alternative immunization schedules such as 0, 2 or 0, 3 months could be used.

In addition, the inventors sought to compare these adjuvant formulations to WN-80E formulated with alum. Following a single injection of WN-80E adjuvanted with alum, SE or SLA agonist combined with SE (SLA-SE), both the cellular and humoral WN-80E specific immune responses were examined. Seven days following immunization, it was observed that an increase in the number or WN-80E specific IFN\u03b3+ CD4+ cells in the spleen of SLA-SE immunized animals compared to those immunized with SE alone or Alum (FIG. 1A). ICS analysis of T-cell populations demonstrated that many of these IFN\u03b3+ T-cells were polyfunctional, with a high percentage those from the SLA-SE immunized animals showing a canonical Th1 phenotype (IFN\u03b3+/TNF\u03b1+/IL-2+) (FIG. 1B). The production of Th1 CD4+ T-cells at this timepoint was correlated with an increase in IgG2c antibodies in the serum 21 days post-immunization (FIG. 2C). In contrast, total IgG and IgG1 titers in serum at day 21 were similar among all adjuvanted groups (FIGS. 2A and 2B). Examination of the neutralizing potential of the induced antibodies showed a correlation between the presence of IgG2c antibodies in the serum and increased neutralization potential; animals immunized with SLA-SE had the highest IgG2c titers and showed higher PRNT titers compared to those immunized with Alum or SE. Furthermore, high PRNT titers were induced even at greatly reduced WN-80E doses; the PRNT titers observed following immunization with 0.1 \u03bcg WN-80E+SLA-SE were significantly greater (P<0.05) than those observed following immunization with 10 \u03bcg of protein in combination with Alum. Taken together, these results suggest that SLA-SE can increase the neutralizing antibody titer generated after a single injection with WN-80E, and that inclusion of the SLA agonist may allow up to 100 fold dose sparing of the antigen.",

                                "Given the increase in neutralizing antibodies induced by the combination of SLA and SE, we investigated whether or not addition of SLA could increase protective capacity when combined with the licensed adjuvant Alum. Mice were immunized with reduced amounts (either 1 \u03bcg or 0.1 \u03bcg) of antigen in combination with stable emulsion or Alum containing adjuvants via the intramuscular route. Two groups of mice were immunized. One group was euthanized 21 days following immunization to examine serum antibody responses to WN-80E, the second was challenged via the intra-peritoneal route with 100 LD50 WNV (NY99 strain). Three days following challenge, serum was collected from all mice, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. When compared with WN-80E alone, all adjuvanted groups induced similar levels of total serum IgG and IgG1 against WN-80E (FIG. 3A, 3B). As in the previous experiments, the inclusion of the SLA agonist adjuvant induced a significantly increased level of IgG2c when combined with both Alum and SE, as well as in a aqueous formulation (FIG. 3C). Those groups showing a significant increase in IgG2c titers also showed elevated PRNT titers at this timepoint (FIG. 3D). These results are consistent with previous findings, that SLA containing adjuvants show increased neutralizing potential, and that this is correlated with the induction of a Th1 antibody response characterized by increased levels of IgG2c. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the formulation flexibility of SLA, demonstrating an increase in WNV neutralizing titers alone or when combined with Alum or SE formulations.",
                                "In a parallel study, the inventors investigated the ability of SLA containing adjuvants to protect animals from lethal WNV challenge following a single immunization in combination with WN-80E. Mice were immunized once with WN-80E combined with antigen, and challenged 21 days post-immunization. Following challenge, ail control mice succumbed to infection by day 10. Consistent with previous data utilizing WN-80E, mice immunized with antigen alone showed a 70% survival rate, while 80% of animals immunized with WN-80E combined with either SE emulsion alone or an aqueous formulation of SLA (SLA-AF) survived. All animals immunized with Alum, SLA-Alum or SLA-SE adjuvants survived challenge (FIG. 4A, 4B, Table 1). In addition to survival, examined the viral titers were examined 3 days following challenge. The adjuvants were clearly effective in reducing viral load (FIG. 4C). Animals immunized with 0.1 \u03bcg WN-80E and Alum or SE alone showed detectable titers in 70% and 30% of animals. Addition of SLA to SE reduced the number of animals with detectable titer to 10%, while addition of SLA to Alum resulted in no detectable virus titer in any animal at this time point. Collectively, these results demonstrate that addition of the TLR agonist SLA in formulations can enhance the protection of WN-80E antigen in mice by reducing virus titers to minimal or undetectable levels at a low antigen dose (0.1 \u03bcg) after only a single immunization.",

In an independent study, the inventors have further investigated the cellular correlates for reduction of d3 virus titers observed in a prior study. The ability of adjuvants to stimulate antibody producing cells following immunization was examined. Following a single immunization, an elevated number of CD138+B22010 preplasmablast cells in animals immunized with SLA containing adjuvants was observed (FIG. 5A). High levels of these cells are maintained following a boost injection in SLA-Alum and SLA-SE adjuvants (FIG. 5B). Animals immunized with SLA-SE or SLA-Alum also showed a strong induction of Th1 CD4+ T-cells following a prime immunization (FIG. 6). In addition, SLA-Alum, SE, and SLA-immunized mice showed increased CD95+/GL7+ germinal center (GC) cells in draining inguinal lymph nodes following two injections, suggesting that this subtype may correlate with reduction in virus titer (FIG. 5B).",

                                "There are a number of WNV vaccines in pre-clinical or clinical stages of development, yet to date, none are available for human use. Live attenuated WNV vaccines based on the 17D strain of Yellow Fever virus have advanced the furthest in clinical trials; the vaccine has shown positive safety and immunogenicity profiles in Phase I and Phase II trials. However, as with all live attenuated vaccines, the ability of the vaccine vector to replicate in immunized subjects and potentially to cause disease during the viremic period remains a documented concern. Furthermore, live attenuated vaccines such as Yellow Fever pose a more significant risk to elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who are at greater risk for severe complications from WNV infection. In order to circumvent some of these safety concerns, a number of subunit vaccines based on the E protein have been developed. Of these, the WN-80E protein is the most clinically advanced, in a Phase I study, WN-80E was shown to be safe and immunogenic after 3 doses of 5 \u03bcg, 15 \u03bcg or 50 \u03bcg of protein adjuvanted with Alhydrogel\u00ae (Clinical Trial#: NCT00707642). While these results are promising, the overall level of virus neutralizing antibody induced by this vaccine was low relative to live attenuated vaccines. Furthermore, an ideal vaccine would provide sufficient protection after a single vaccine dose and would require less antigen, ultimately lowering the cost/dose. The primary goal of this study was to identify an adjuvant which may provide both dose and dosage sparing functions, ultimately enabling durable protection following a single dose of WN-80E antigen.",
                                "In pre-clinical development studies with WN-80E, 1 \u03bcg of protein was shown to be immunogenic in mice following two injections with the saponin based ISCOMATRIX\u00ae adjuvant. In this study, it is demonstrated that induction of PRNT titers in mice following a single injection of 0.1 \u03bcg of WN-80E in combination with SLA-SE. The level of neutralizing antibody following immunization, which serves as a correlate of protection for several other Flavivirus vaccines, was dependent on the presence of SLA, and was correlated with an increase in serum IgG2c titers. The induction of IgG2c antibodies is in turn dependent on induction of a Th1 CD4+ T-cell response by SLA, providing a mechanism for SLA mediated enhancement of protection that is consistent with studies investigating other vaccines. In an additional arm of this study, the response in all groups is boosted with an additional injection, and find that PRNT titers as well as IgG2c levels are increased in all adjuvanted groups (FIG. 7). This finding would suggest that one of the key functions of SLA is to accelerate the induction of neutralizing responses.",
                                "The enhancement of neutralizing antibody responses by SLA-SE prompted the inventors to examine the ability of SLA to enhance antigen specific responses in additional formulations. While emulsion based adjuvants (e.g., MF95, Novartis) are in use clinically in Europe, approval in the U.S. and other countries has been problematic to date. In order to initiate development of a vaccine formulation that may be advanced into clinical trials, SLA-Alum was focused on for two reasons. First, WN-80E has already shown promise in clinical trials in combination with Alum. Second, the SLA-Alum formulation utilized in this study is similar to AS04 (GlaxoSmithKline), which combines the TLR-4 agonist monophosphoryl Lipid-A (MPL), and which is licensed for use as a component of the HPV vaccine Cervarix\u00ae. The primary difference between SLA-Alum and AS04 is the use of a fully synthetic, rationally designed TLR-4 agonist (SLA) which has improved potency compared to a purified biological product (MPL) which is a mixture of compounds, only some of which are known to show TLR-4 agonism in humans. As with SLA-SE, SLA-Alum is capable of increasing the neutralizing antibody response following a single immunization with WN-80E, with the magnitude of the neutralizing response similar between SLA-SE and SLA-Alum at a low antigen dose.",
                                "As expected from previous studies, immunization with WN-80E increased survival of animals following challenge, a finding consistent with the relatively low lethality of WNV in murine models. However, adjuvants could be stratified based on their ability to reduce serum viral titer at early times post challenge. This ability is critically important, as early replication of WNV is correlated with increased neuroinvasion at later timepoints and serious disease. At lower antigen doses, immunization with Alum resulted in an average titer decrease of less than 10-fold relative to naive controls, with 70% of animals showing measurable virus titers. Addition of SLA to Alum resulted in undetectable virus in 100% of animals, which represents a decrease in titer of approximately 1000-fold relative to uninfected controls.",
                                "Collectively, our findings demonstrate the utility and formulation flexibility of SLA as an effective adjuvant for recombinant WNV vaccines, and that SLA induces a more potent and effective antibody response. In previous studies, the inclusion of a TLR-4 agonist was shown to increase the diversity of antibody variable regions following immunization with a malaria antigen suggesting a more rapid maturation of the antibody response which correlates with increased neutralization potential. Consistent with this mechanism, the inventors find an increased number of germinal center B-cells present in animals immunized with SLA containing adjuvants, suggesting that a more mature antibody response has developed following immunization with SLA-Alum or SLA-SE. In addition SLA-Alum and SLA-SE induce an increased number of CD138+CD19lo preplasmablast cells, which may contribute to the neutralizing antibodies observed after a single injection. Future studies which directly address the antibody diversity induced by these adjuvants will confirm this mechanism. In addition, characterization of novel antibodies may allow estimation of the percentage of antibodies produced which have neutralizing potential. Previous studies have mapped neutralizing antibodies to epitopes in DII and DIII in both WNV as well as other flaviviral E proteins in mice. However, more recent studies suggest that DIM antibodies may not play a critical role in neutralization in humans infected with other flaviviruses.",
                                "Another promising aspect of these results is the possibility of broadened protection against diverse flaviviruses induced by SLA-Alum or SLA-SE. Many studies have previously investigated cross-protection capability between flavivirus E-proteins, and have found that E-proteins from one virus can protect against other viruses in the genus. This cross protection is attributed to structural similarities between the E-proteins of members of a flavivirus serogroup. In previous studies with other viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), TLR-4 agonist adjuvants have been shown to increase protection not only to homologous virus, but also to antigenically distinct heterologous viruses. These findings, in combination with those presented here suggest the possibility that SLA containing adjuvants represent a tool to enhance protection against drifted flaviviral strains, such as the lineage 2 WNV viruses which are currently emerging in Europe. SLA based formulations may also be useful to enhance the protection across the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, where protection against the multiple serotypes is critical for an effective vaccine.",
                                "In summary, a clinical stage recombinant WNV antigen, WN-80E, was utilized to identify SLA adjuvant formulations capable of generating robust immune responses. The results demonstrate that robust responses can be generated after a single dose and these responses provide protection against virus challenge in the mouse model of West Nile Virus disease. Furthermore, it is demonstrated herein that SLA-Alum induces enhanced protection in mice when compared to Alum alone, as no virus was detected by the plaque method in any of the mice in the SLA-Alum group. Future work to optimize this formulation by investigating additional doses of SLA and routes of immunization will provide a foundation for advancement of this vaccine into additional models and future clinical studies. Ultimately, the use of SLA as an adjuvant may provide a more effective vaccine for this emerging public health threat and help to reduce the severity and size of future WNV outbreaks."

                                "West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted member of the Flaviviridae family that has emerged in the 21st century to become a public health threat. Given the sporadic nature of WNV epidemics both temporally and geographically, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that can rapidly provide effective immunity. Protection from WNV infection is correlated with antibodies to the viral envelope (E) protein, which encodes receptor binding and fusion functions. Despite many promising E-protein vaccine candidates, there are currently none licensed for use in humans. This study reports the optimization of a WNV vaccine candidate containing a clinical-stage WNV recombinant E-protein antigen (WN-80E) and a TLR-4 agonist adjuvant containing a synthetic Lipid A TLR-4 agonist (SLA) and the saponin QS21. We have optimized a liposome formulation with these adjuvant components (LSQ) for rapid induction of potent antiviral immunity in murine models, and find that both SLA and QS21 individually stimulate the production of multi-functional Th1 CD4+ T-cells (IFN\u25a1+/TNF\u25a1+/IL-2+), as well as an increase in the number of germinal center B-Cells (CD95+/GL7+) in a dose dependent manner. Consistent with induction of Th1 biased cellular immunity, the humoral response following adjuvanted immunization in mice is focused toward production of class-switched IgG2c antibodies, resulting in high levels of virus neutralization activity. Importantly, we observe significantly increased neutralizing titers in mice given formulations which contain both SLA and QS21, compared to either component alone. Using an optimized vaccine formulation, we demonstrate induction of durable immunity (300 days) following a single immunization in mice, and stimulation of functional protective immunity in a Syrian hamster challenge model of WNV disease. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the utility of LSQ adjuvant formulations for induction of functional and durable immunity for recombinant subunit protein vaccines for flaviviruses.",

                                "Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study by targeted physical examination, routine laboratory testing (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) and the recording of vital signs and adverse events in study volunteers. In addition, subjects will use diary cards for 14+/\u22122 days after each vaccination to record reactogenicity and tolerance data as well as specific adverse events. Efficacy assessments in this study will include the determination of the rate and extent of virus neutralizing antibody titers (i.e., functional immunogenicity), as determined by PRNT50 (plaque reduction neutralization test) assay of >1:10.",
                                "The inventors expect the vaccine to be well tolerated with no severe adverse events throughout the dosing period. Additionally, the vaccine is expected to be effective and confer a sufficient protective immune response to WNV mediated disease."

WN-80E+SLA-LSQ has been shown to be effective following delivery by a number of immunization routes (i.m., s.c., i.n.). WN-80E+SLA-LSQ provides durable immunity, with protective antibody titers observed in murine models up to 300 days following a single immunization. We have established protective and non-protective doses of WN-80E in murine and hamster models in order to quantify adjuvant induced dose sparing. We have established the contribution of all adjuvant components to survival in a murine model following prime-boost immunization with low levels (10ng) of WN-80E.",
