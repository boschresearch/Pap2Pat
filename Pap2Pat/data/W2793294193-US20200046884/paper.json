    "title": "Short peptide analogs as alternatives to collagen in pro-regenerative corneal implants",
    "date": "2018-03-01",
    "abstract": "Short collagen-like peptides (CLPs) are being proposed as alternatives to full-length collagen for use in tissue engineering, on their own as soft hydrogels, or conjugated to synthetic polymer for mechanical strength. However, despite intended clinical use, little is known about their safety and efficacy, mechanism of action or degree of similarity to the full-length counterparts they mimic. Here, we show the functional equivalence of a CLP conjugated to polyethylene glycol (CLP-PEG) to full-length recombinant human collagen in vitro and in promoting stable regeneration of corneal tissue and nerves in a pre-clinical mini-pig model. We also show that these peptide analogs exerted their pro-regeneration effects through stimulating extracellular vesicle production by host cells. Our results support future use of CLP-PEG implants for corneal regeneration, suggesting the feasibility of these or similar peptide analogs in clinical application in the eye and other tissues. Although biomaterials comprising full-length recombinant human collagen and extracted animal collagen have been evaluated and used clinically, these macromolecules provide only a limited number of functional groups amenable to chemical modification or crosslinking and are demanding to process. Synthetic, customizable analogs that are functionally equivalent, and can be readily scaled-up are therefore very desirable for pre-clinical to clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate, using cornea regeneration as our test bed, that collagen-like-peptides conjugated to multifunctional polyethylene glycol (CLP-PEG) when grafted into mini-pigs as corneal implants were functionally equivalent to recombinant human collagen-based implants that were successfully tested in patients. We also show for the first time that these materials affected regeneration through stimulation of extracellular vesicle production by endogenous host cells that have migrated into the CLP-PEG scaffolds.",

                "The current global need for replacement organs and tissues requires numbers that far exceed the donor supply. Artificial organs as alternatives can potentially save and improve the quality of lives of patients. The macromolecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM), specifically collagen, have been extensively tested for use as organ substitutes [1]. The premise is that the ECM macromolecules will stimulate regeneration, recapitulating their role in organogenesis during embryogenesis. ECM-derived or inspired biopolymers ranging from decellularized tissues/organs to fabricated constructs are being evaluated or used clinically for promoting regeneration. However, natural ECM macromolecules like collagen are large and difficult to extract and process or modify, and are heterogeneous and source-dependent. While the use of recombinantly produced human collagen eliminates heterogeneity, these are still large macromolecules that require significant processing. This makes short peptide analogs that are readily prepared, easily customized and scaled-up, very attractive ECM alternatives for regenerative medicine. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that such short ECM-mimicking peptides can stimulate regeneration in a range of organ systems including bone and spinal cord [2], [3]. However, despite their great potential, little is known about their safety and efficacy, mechanism of action, or functional equivalence to their clinically evaluated full-length counterparts.",
                "Here, we tested under pre-clinical conditions in mini-pigs, the safety and efficacy of a collagen-like peptide (CLP) conjugated to an inert but mechanically tougher multifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) to emulate the function of a collagen-based implant [4] for promoting regeneration, using the cornea as a model system. The cornea is the transparent front of the eye and major refractive surface for focusing light to the retina for vision. Its superficial location and transparency allow easy access and real-time visualization of cell-biomaterial interactions. A diseased or damaged cornea with permanent transparency loss results in blindness. The conventional treatment is transplantation with donated human corneas. However, like other organs, cornea transplantation suffers from a severe global shortfall, with an estimated 12.7\u202fmillion patients worldwide awaiting transplantation, or only one out of every 70 patients being transplanted [5]. The transparency, accessibility plus the pressing medical need make the cornea an attractive model tissue.",
                "We previously used full-length recombinant human collagen type III (RHCIII) to fabricate implants that successfully stimulated stable regeneration of the human cornea, an organ that does not normally regenerate on its own. Corneal implants comprising RHCIII only and RHCIII incorporating 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), a synthetic lipid-polymer that can suppress inflammation, [6] were evaluated clinically [7], [8], [9]. They respectively promoted stable corneal regeneration without continual immunosuppression in 10 conventional transplantation patients [7], [8] and three patients diagnosed as being at high-risk for rejection of donor corneas [9]. Although the use of RHCIII instead of extracted animal collagen mitigates potential source heterogeneity, xenogeneic reaction, or risk of pathogen transmission [10], [11], RHCIII replicates full-length collagen, which, is large and relatively difficult to chemically tailor or process, unlike short peptides. In this study, we compared in detail the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of promoting regeneration of corneal implants made from CLP-PEG to control implants made from clinically tested RHCIII-MPC in vitro, and in rabbit and mini-pig animal models. Successful testing in a simple organ system like the cornea will allow for the extension to more complex applications such as skin and heart, as we have shown with collagen after minimal modification [12], [13], [14]."

High pressure freezing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that both hydrogels comprised very fine fibrils (Fig.\u202f1c, d). The denaturation temperature of the CLP-PEG hydrogels was considerably higher than those of native corneas and RHCIII-MPC controls (Table S2A). However, this likely reflects the temperature at which PEG and not the peptides start to melt. RHCIII-MPC implants had considerably higher tensile strength, but CLP-PEG implants were more elastic and showed 4\u202ftimes the % elongation, compensating for the lower strength during surgical handling (Table S2B). Both implants were significantly weaker than human corneas, but this can be accounted for by the difference in solids content. Implants comprised of well over 90% water while the human cornea contains about 78% water [23].Fig. 1Implants, structure and mechanical stability.

In this test, two different strains of Salmonella typhimurium used respectively for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity testing were exposed to different dilutions of homogenized hydrogels, along with positive controls [25]. Neither the RHCIII-MPC controls (Fig.\u202f2a) nor CLP-PEG gels (Fig.\u202f2b) were cytotoxic or genotoxic.

The only difference observed was between cells grown on the three-dimensional hydrogels and those grown on two-dimensional tissue culture plastic (TCP) (Fig.\u202f2c). The metabolic activity of cells on TCP was significantly higher at 24\u202fh and 48\u202fh indicating a larger cell number.

                        "Both control RHCIII-MPC and CLP-PEG implants were seamlessly incorporated into the mini-pig corneas without any excessive redness, swelling or inflammation. The rate and course of regeneration stimulated by CLP-PEG implants paralleled that of control RHCIII-MPC implants over the 12-month observation period (Table 1), resulting in neo-corneas of comparable thickness (Fig. S2). At 12\u202fmonths post-operation, all regenerated neo-corneas remained stably integrated and were optically transparent (Fig.\u202f3a) without any sustained immune suppression. In general, implanted corneas showed early vascular in-growth at three months post-operation, which was coincidental with the development of haze in the grafted eyes. The vessels receded and the implanted corneas became clear again. In vivo confocal microscopy showed that all implanted corneas had regenerated epithelia similar to healthy unoperated corneas. Infiltration of stromal cells was observed at three months post-operation (Fig. S3). The corneal nerves that were cut during the surgery had regenerated and were observed penetrating the implant area at six months post-operation (Fig. S3). By 12\u202fmonths post-operation, the regenerated neo-corneas had fully regenerated epithelia (Fig.\u202f3b), a populated stroma (Fig.\u202f3c) and corneal nerves (Fig.\u202f3d) resembling those of their normal, unoperated contralateral counterparts. Aesthesiometry measures corneal sensory function and hence, provides an indicator of nerve regeneration. At five weeks post-operation, the corneas were unresponsive to touch (Fig.\u202f3e). At three months post-operation, CLP-PEG implanted corneas were more touch sensitive than RHCIII-MPC implanted ones. By six months post-operation, however, touch sensitivity of all implanted corneas was comparable to that of normal controls.Fig. 3RHCIII-MPC and CLP-PEG corneal implants and their performance in mini-pigs. Examples of optically clear RHCIII-MPC and CLP-PEG hydrogel implants (a). After 12\u202fmonths of implantation in corneas of mini-pigs, the implants remain clear like the unoperated cornea. Arrows indicate the boundaries of the implants. In vivo confocal microscopy shows that both RHCIII-MPC and CLP-PEG implanted corneas have regenerated their epithelium (b), stroma (c) and sub-epithelial nerve plexus (d) to resemble their counterparts in the normal, healthy cornea. Scale bars, 150\u202f\u00b5m. Aesthesiometry measures the pressure needed to obtain a blink reaction, i.e. touch sensitivity, which is correlated to nerve function. Pre-operatively, all healthy corneas showed a response to light touch. At 5\u202fweeks post-operation, the implanted corneas were non-responsive, even with maximal pressure exerted. At 3\u202fmonths, touch sensitivity is returning so less pressure was needed for a response. By 6\u202fmonths, sensitivity was back to normal levels. * \u2013 p\u202f<\u202f.05 as compared to un-operated eyes (Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post hoc test).Table 1Progress of CLP-PEG and RHCIII-MPC implants grafted into corneas of mini-pigs, compared to untreated contralateral control eyes over the 12\u202fmonth post-operation period.TreatmentTimeCornea thickness (mm)HazeVascularizationSchirmer's tear test (mm)Aesthesiometry (mm)IOP (mmHg)implantmarginCLP-PEGpre-op706\u202f\u00b1\u202f2000012\u202f\u00b1\u202f33.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.310\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fm\u20130.380.51.757\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u20133\u202fm690\u202f\u00b1\u202f160.251.75013\u202f\u00b1\u202f31.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.416\u202f\u00b1\u202f26\u202fm702\u202f\u00b1\u202f22000.7512\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.116\u202f\u00b1\u202f29\u202fm724\u202f\u00b1\u202f13000.516\u202f\u00b1\u202f22.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.119\u202f\u00b1\u202f812\u202fm747\u202f\u00b1\u202f800213\u202f\u00b1\u202f43.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.122\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u2028\u2028RHCIII-MPCpre-op704\u202f\u00b1\u202f2100011\u202f\u00b1\u202f34.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.611\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fm\u20130.380.50.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u20133\u202fm652\u202f\u00b1\u202f90.691.750.515\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.514\u202f\u00b1\u202f26\u202fm669\u202f\u00b1\u202f2200213\u202f\u00b1\u202f24.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.620\u202f\u00b1\u202f29\u202fm687\u202f\u00b1\u202f1100013\u202f\u00b1\u202f44.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.716\u202f\u00b1\u202f212\u202fm693\u202f\u00b1\u202f2300015\u202f\u00b1\u202f44.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.815\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u2028\u2028Untreatedpre-op725\u202f\u00b1\u202f110008\u202f\u00b1\u202f28\u202f\u00b1\u202f211\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fm\u20130009\u202f\u00b1\u202f19\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u20133\u202fm730\u202f\u00b1\u202f1000012\u202f\u00b1\u202f212\u202f\u00b1\u202f217\u202f\u00b1\u202f26\u202fm738\u202f\u00b1\u202f1000010\u202f\u00b1\u202f110\u202f\u00b1\u202f117\u202f\u00b1\u202f39\u202fm747\u202f\u00b1\u202f1100013\u202f\u00b1\u202f313\u202f\u00b1\u202f316\u202f\u00b1\u202f612\u202fm767\u202f\u00b1\u202f1100015\u202f\u00b1\u202f215\u202f\u00b1\u202f218\u202f\u00b1\u202f2"

Immunohistochemistry performed on frozen sections of pig corneas implanted with CLP-PEG or RHCIII-MPC showed differential staining for CD9, a well-known marker for exosomes, and Rab-7, a endosome-exosome marker [28]. Healthy unoperated corneas and RHCIII-MPC implanted corneas showed minimal to moderate staining for CD9 while CLP-PEG implanted corneas showed marked CD9 staining (Fig.\u202f5b and c). Rab7 staining was increased in the epithelial layer of CLP-PEG implanted corneas relative to unoperated controls (Fig.\u202f5d). In RHCIII-MPC implants, Rab7 staining was confined to the basal portions of the epithelium. We confirmed that HCECs were producing EVs by culturing these cells on CLP-PEG hydrogels. Controls comprised RHCIII-MPC hydrogels and tissue culture plastic (Fig. S6). HCECs on tissue culture plastic showed CD9 staining mainly at the leading edges. CD9 stained vesicles were seen over the entire cytoplasm of cells grown on RHCIII-MPC, while staining in cells on CLP-PEG were mainly perinuclear (Fig. S5). Rab7 stained vesicles remained intracellular and were markedly increased in HCECs cultured on CLP-PEG, compared to RHCIII-MPC, while staining was perinuclear on tissue culture plastic (Fig. S6). Finally, we observed increased CD9 staining below the basal epithelium of the limbus showing co-localization with collagen type V in the CLP-PEG implanted corneas but neither RHCIII-MPC nor unoperated corneas showed such striking co-localization (Fig.\u202f5e).Fig. 5Extracellular vesicle release from regenerating neo-corneas stimulated by biomimetic implants.

                "A wide range of mimetic peptides have been developed as analogs to native collagen. The Hartgerink group produced the first collagen mimetic peptides that formed hydrogels from purely peptide interactions suggesting their possible functional equivalence to full-length collagen [29]. However, these hydrogels as described were too soft to be used as corneal implants. By conjugating CLP to inert PEG [2], [4], we produced implants that were sufficiently robust for surgical handling [4]. This is keeping with reports where several backbone structures such as poly(amidoamine)-based dendrimers (PAMAM), 4 arm or 8 arm poly ethylene glycol (PEG) when conjugated to CLPs, which not only promoted triple helical formation of the attached CLPs but also provided additional mechanical strength [2]. CLP-PEG hydrogels were optically transparent and flexible, and retained their optical clarity and flexibility after 12\u202fmonths of storage. Their composition remained unchanged as evidenced by the FTIR spectral profiles of freshly-made and 30-month old hydrogel samples. Although the Amide I absorption peak (primarily peptide bond C\u202f=\u202fO stretch) is known to be highly dependent on peptide secondary structure [24], [30], the appearance of this very characteristic peak along with the others, namely Amide A, B, and II (Table S3, Fig. S1B), attributed to the presence of CLP which are also in good agreement with previously published reports [17], [24], and the striking similarity in the fingerprint region (\u2264800\u202fcm\u22121) between the fresh and the stored sample indicate that their chemical composition remained essentially the same. We also showed that the ability of hydrogels to resist collagenase digestion was unchanged after 30\u202fmonths of storage compared to the profile reported for freshly-made samples [4]. It is pertinent to note, however, that while FTIR and collagenase digestion assays are useful techniques to monitor the stability of the hydrogels, for a complete assessment of long-term storage, complementary methods (such as weight loss, mechanical properties including stress/strain curves, surface changes using SEM, contact angle and analysis of degradation solutions, etc.) would be necessary [31], [32]. Nevertheless, our results indicated that CLP-PEG hydrogels remained sufficiently stable when stored for over 12\u202fmonths. They were not as tough as the clinically evaluated RHCIII-MPC implants, but compensated for this by being more elastic, which allowed them to withstand the grafting procedure. Implants into rabbit corneas showed that the mechanical properties of the regenerated neo-corneas were similar to healthy, unoperated corneas. This is the desired end-point, so initially weaker implants were not an issue.",
                "Prior to pre-clinical use, a range of in vitro toxicology tests is required to demonstrate the safety of the implants. Like RHCIII-MPC implants that have been tested in animals [33] and clinically [7], [9], CLP-PEG implants were cell friendly and allowed for proliferation. Genotoxicity tests results showed little/no risk of induction of mutagenesis.",
                "Unlike RHCIII-MPC implants, however, CLP-PEG implants do not contain any collagen. Remarkably, high pressure freezing TEM showed that CLP-PEG hydrogels had very fine fibrillar structures similar to those of the RHCIII-MPC hydrogels. This supports the contention that CLPs mimic their native counterparts in forming tiny fibrils [34].",
                "When grafted into pig corneas, like the control RHCIII-MPC implants, CLP-PEG implants promoted regeneration of corneal epithelium, stroma and nerves [4]. Here, detailed histopathological examination showed hyperplasia of the epithelium in implanted corneas. The implants were only 500\u202f\u03bcm thick while the pigs\u2019 corneas were all over 600\u202f\u03bcm, showing that the epithelium had thickened to restore normal corneal thickness. This is a well-known post-surgical finding in human and animal corneas after photorefractive surgery [35], [36] and after corneal implantation [37], so was not considered a pathological finding.",
                "In Islam et al., we reported the presence of type I and V collagen in regenerated neo-corneas implanted with CLP-PEG [4]. In the cornea, as with the rest of the body, the cells most frequently associated with synthesis and secretion of collagen are the fibroblasts and their precursors, although there were early reports that the corneal epithelium secretes collagen [38], [39]. In this study, SBF-SEM clearly showed that the regenerating epithelium produced copious amounts of EVs. Immunohistochemistry showed co-localization of exosome marker CD9 with collagen-type V to these EVs and adjacent area. This strongly suggested that cornea-specific collagen V was secreted by the epithelium into the stroma through EVs. TEM showed that proteoglycans were present. During early cornea development, the epithelium produces ECM that attracts stromal cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that this process is recapitulated in the biomaterials-induced corneal regeneration observed, and EV secretion is involved. The regenerated epithelium had most likely secreted collagen and proteoglycans within the implants, thereby attracting in-growth of fibroblasts and nerves. Consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that markedly more exosomes are secreted by epithelium in CLP-PEG implanted corneas that contain no collagen that in control RHCIII-MPC implants where collagen is already present within the scaffolds. While further work is ongoing to characterize the EVs produced by CLP-PEG and RHCIII-MPC implantation, we have nevertheless shown that EVs have a role in collagen- and analog-enabled corneal regeneration. This is in keeping with observations that exosomes are potent mediators of regeneration that are now being tested as cell-free therapeutic agents in several systems including cardiac regeneration [40].",
                "Studies of nerve regeneration showed that corneas implanted with CLP-PEG regained sensitivity slightly faster. However, by six months post-operation, touch sensitivity which is correlated to nerve function was equivalent in both CLP-PEG and control RHCIII-MPC eyes."

                "As peptide analogs of ECM proteins head towards clinical application, establishing their safety and efficacy profiles is critical. We have shown that hydrogels made from a short collagen analog conjugated to PEG are safe and functionally equivalent to those comprising full-length, recombinantly produced human collagen that successfully regenerated human corneas, in both in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical animal testing. We further show that these ECM-mimetic hydrogels promoted regeneration by stimulating in-growing endogenous host cells to produce matrix components through secretory extracellular vesicles. With this safety and efficacy profile and mechanism of action now known, further testing of CLP-PEG hydrogels in human subjects is merited to determine the full extent of the utility of peptide analogs as pro-regeneration implants in the cornea and in other organ systems."
