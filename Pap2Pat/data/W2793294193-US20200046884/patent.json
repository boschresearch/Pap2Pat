                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The cornea is the transparent covering and the main refractive element of the eye. It is responsible for transmission of light to the retina. The human cornea is composed of three primary layers, an outermost epithelium layer, a middle stroma containing keratocytes and an innermost single layer of endothelial cells.",
                        "One of the major causes of blindness worldwide is corneal diseases. The diseases lead to loss of corneal transparency and subsequently deteriorates the vision. There are a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory eye diseases that cause corneal scarring and may result in total blindness. Microbial attack is a common cause of corneal disease.",
                        "The most widely accepted treatment for corneal blindness is transplantation of a full thickness healthy donor cornea after removal of the damaged tissue. The process is termed as penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Unfortunately, the approach of penetrating keratoplasty suffers from several shortcomings due to the following reasons: \u2014\n\n\n- - The supply of donor tissue is substantially less than the demand for\n    transplantation that has resulted in 12.7 million untreated patients\n    worldwide as reported in 2016, with an additional 1.5 million new\n    patients every year.\n  - Donor cornea is often rejected in a large proportion of patients due\n    to reasons such as autoimmune situations, chemical burns, and\n    infections.\n  - Survival rate of corneal grafts decreases over time.\n  - Donor-cornea derived infection such as HSV is another serious\n    complication associated with transplantation of human donor corneas.\n    Donor corneas should be screened which is an expensive procedure,\n    with processing fees in the USA around 2.5-3.5 thousand US dollars\n    per cornea.",
                        "There has been a long history of research into the development of alternatives to human corneas with both artificial as well as natural alternatives. Xenograft transplantation using corneas from pigs and sheep have been tried. But the said approach suffers from many disadvantages such as immune rejections as well as cross-species diseases due to transmission of pathogens.",
                        "Decellularized organs have been studied to evaluate their potential as grafts in same or cross-species due to their ability to retain the native extra-cellular matrix of the target organ. But, decellularized corneas also have shortcomings due to incompatibility and rejections.",
                        "Artificial corneas known as keratoprostheses (KPro's) have been in development for over 200 years. Artificial corneas utilizing quartz crystal implant, plastic optical core like poly (methyl methacrylate), poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) etc. have been used. But the use of such artificial corneas involves the need for lifetime antibiotics as well as immune suppression in a large proportion of patients. The retention rates of these artificial corneas are extremely less and more than half of such artificial corneas do not last beyond three years. Moreover, the patients are at risk of glaucoma, a very severe side effect that can result in blindness.",
                        "As collagen is the main component of the corneal extracellular matrix, artificial corneas made from collagen have garnered a lot of interest as alternatives to human donor corneas. The main source of collagen is extracted animal protein, although recombinantly produced collagen is now available. To give mechanical strength, enzymatic stability and feasibility for transplantation, collagen is cross-linked by different mechanisms.",
                        "Optically transparent and cell friendly corneal implants made from porcine and bovine collagen and transplanted into animal models exhibit immunogenic reaction. Animal-derived collagen comes from heterogeneous sources, and because of the different levels of processing and screening in each different source, great care needs to be taken due to the risk of transmitting diseases as well as provoking immune responses in the host.",
                        "The use of recombinant human collagen mitigates the heterogeneity and pathogen transmission issue. However, the production and purification of recombinant human collagen is an expensive process that makes the price of the artificial cornea unreachable to the neediest individuals. Therefore, an alternative that could replace recombinant human collagen with the same physicochemical and biological properties would be a huge advancement. Collagen-like peptides (CLP) or collagen mimetic peptides have been developed as functional alternatives of collagen.",
                        "Corneal implants based on collagen-like peptides crosslinked using various cross-linkers have been developed till date. N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) crosslinking system has been used for development of corneal implants. But the same has been found to be cytotoxic to the surrounding cells.",
                        "DMTMM has been used as a crosslinker in a wide variety of applications. But the use of the same for development of hydrogels and implants is not known. The usage of DMTMM as a crosslinker has allowed unprecedented advantages over the previously used crosslinkers. The advantages include improved mechanical properties, improved thermal properties and less cytotoxic effect.",
                        "In the prior art, collagen-like peptides having characteristics very similar to that of collagens have been developed. One such collagen-like peptide having 36 amino acid has been used as a base peptide for the present invention, which is modified to impart mechanical strength and multifunctionality such as anti-inflammatory property and resistance to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).",
                        "The implants based on collagen-like peptide crosslinked with DMTMM and containing the MMP cleavage motif and the anti-inflammation motifs is highly efficacious compared to the implants disclosed in the prior art.",
                        "The present invention thus contemplates to overcome the problems of the prior art to solve a long-standing problem of development of corneal implants with improved mechanical properties and less cytotoxic effect. Further, the approach used for development of this invention would make the improved implants more accessible and affordable to the 90% of the world's visually impaired who live in low-income nations.",
                        "Further, the invention may also be utilized for cosmetic purposes such as for correction of refractive errors, use as fillers for correcting previous laser eye surgery (PRK, LASIK, LASEK) or use as onlays, inlays and rings instead of laser eye surgery to correct vision. The filler glue can also be used as anti-aging tools to fill wrinkles."
