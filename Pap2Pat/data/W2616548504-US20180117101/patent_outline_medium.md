## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

- introduce genetically modified probiotic (GMP) to deliver functional PAL enzyme
- describe probiotic characteristics
- motivate use of probiotic in PKU treatment
- describe PAL enzyme selection and characteristics
- codon optimize PAL gene for probiotic host
- modify gene construct for transcription, translation, and location
- introduce transcriptional terminator and restriction sites
- describe gene construct introduction into probiotic
- assess in vitro phe metabolism by GMP
- describe administration of purified probiotic organism
- calculate dosage of GMP system
- test genetically engineered probiotic as PKU treatment

### EXAMPLE 1

- introduce Lactobacillus reuteri as probiotic
- describe PAL enzyme selection and codon optimization
- create promoterless AvPAL construct
- attach promoter to AvPAL construct
- create final gene product FuzErmAvPAL
