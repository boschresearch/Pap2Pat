# DESCRIPTION

- relate to prior application

## BACKGROUND

- introduce genetically modified probiotic

## Advantages Over Conventional Technologies

- limitations of conventional PKU treatments
- motivate need for new treatment

## SUMMARY

- summarize genetically modified probiotic invention

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

- describe genetically modified probiotic (GMP) to deliver functional PAL enzyme
- motivate use of GMP in treatment of PKU
- select probiotic bacteria and PAL gene sources
- design and construct GMP system
- introduce GMP system into probiotic and assess in vitro phe metabolism
- administer and use oral GMP to treat PKU

### EXAMPLE 1

- select Lactobacillus reuteri as probiotic
- design and construct AvPAL gene
- create shuttle vector pSLERGT
- ligate AvPAL into pSLERGT
- transform pSLERGT into Lactobacillus reuteri

### EXAMPLE 2

- administer and use oral PHEnominal to treat PKU

### EXAMPLE 3

- demonstrate AvPAL enzyme functionality

### EXAMPLE 4

- test AvPAL gene in Lactobacillus acidophilus
- measure trans-cinnamic acid production
