The invention further relates to a process for identifying genes/genetic elements associated with mating impairment in Trichoderma reesei QM6a and strains derived thereof. Said process enables a rapid and efficient identification of genes/genetic elements associated with mating impairment. Consequently, the present invention relates towards an approach to advance tools for manipulating Trichoderma reesei towards improved and facilitated strain breeding so as to be able to improve industrial producer strains by classical genetic means. This will not only add a further tool in strain breeding and maintenance, but also allow for the introduction of genetic traits from other strains of Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina), or the cleaning of strains from non-desirable mutations of genes and/or undesired genes, e.g. genes conferring resistance to antibiotics, marker genes, genes for secondary metabolism, pigment formation, undesired enzymes etc."

                        "Filamentous fungi are capable of producing high amounts of extracellular proteins. Yet, the production level of any protein of interest in naturally occurring strains is usually too low for commercial exploitation, rendering substantial strain improvement programs essential (Punt 2002). In industrial filamentous fungi, this is traditionally done by classical mutagenesis, and/or targeted gene manipulation in combination with protein engineering. Basically, this approach consists of subjecting the fungus to sub-lethal doses of mutagens (frequently used: for example irradiation by UV light or ionizing radiation, addition of chemical mutagens like nitrosomethyl guanidine, ethylmethansulfonat or ethidium bromide) and subsequent screening of the survivors for improved production of the desired product. Obviously, this approach is only as good as the selection method.",
                        "Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina) is a workhorse organism for the industrial production of enzymes. Using random mutagenesis, academic and industrial research programs have, over several decades, produced strains of T. reesei whose enzyme productivity is several times higher than that of the \u201coriginal\u201d T. reesei strain QM6a that was isolated from US Army tent canvas in 1944 in the Solomon Islands (LeCrom et al. 2009).",
                        "A major constraint using random mutagenesis for strain improvement, however, results from the fact that, by definition it cannot be directed to act on distinct target genes. Mutations may thus not only be beneficial and improve or disrupt target genes but can affect other genes as well leading to unwanted collateral damage causing restrictions in e.g. strain stability, reduced growth rates or auxotrophy for amino acids and/or vitamins. While recombinant techniques overcome these problems by introducing targeting focus, they may be unsuitable for complex genetic traits that are caused by unknown or multiple genes or large genomic fragments.",
                        "Seidl et al. (2009) were the first to describe the ability of Trichoderma reesei to perform sexual reproduction. Taxonomically T. reesei (and its teleomorph H. jecorina) belong to the group of Ascomycetes (class of Sordariomycetes) and within this group to those fungi which are heterothallic. Heterothallism means that the two mating type loci MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 which are necessary for successful sexual reproduction occur in different strains and self-fertilization is not possible.",
                        "During the process of sexual reproduction T. reesei produces perithecia that are initiated by coiled or variously distinctive structures containing the ascogonium. The ascogonium is the cell that will receive a nucleus during mating and go on to produce the dikaryotic hyphal system. One of the cells within the coil functions as the ascogonium and the rest either remains inactive or gives rise to hyphae that branch and proliferate to surround the entire structure. In many cases neighboring hyphae also engage to envelope the coil. These surrounding hyphae eventually consolidate to form the walls or peridium of the perithecium (http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/mycologywebpages/NaturalHistoryOfFungi/SordariomycetesDiscussion.html) (FIG. 3).",
                        "The formation of perithecia in T. reesei occurs ascohymenial meaning that the ascocarp formation initiates with the fertilization of the ascogonium. The primordium subsequently differentiates into a true hymenium directly from the generative, ascogeneous hyphae. The ascohymenial development thus begins with fertilization and differentiation of generative hyphae, followed by the development of the ascocarp. Stromata (fruiting bodies) are therefore formed by the partner acting as a female during sexual reproduction.",
                        "Since all strains of T. reesei which are nowadays used in industry can be traced back to strain QM6a they all carry\u2014as does strain QM6a\u2014the MAT1-2 locus. Crossing of different industrial strains with each other to further improve them by introducing favorable traits or to rid strains from mutations of genes or undesired genes such as e.g. genes conferring e.g. resistance to antibiotics, coding undesired products whose presence may interfere with regulatory requirements is therefore not possible at present.",
                        "A possibility to overcome the inability to cross different T. reesei mutant strains would be to exchange the mating type locus by the opposite one at the same genomic locus. In case of T. reesei QM6a this implies to exchange the MAT1-2 locus for the MAT1-1 locus.",
                        "Kang et al. (1994) have shown that strains of Magnaporthe grisea in which the MAT locus was exchanged were fertile in crossings with strains of the opposite mating type (i.e.: strains in which the MAT1-2 locus was replaced by the MAT1-1 locus were fertile in crossings with the original MAT1-2 carrying strain). A successful exchange of the mating type locus was also described for Neurospora crassa (Chang, 1994).",
                        "WO 2011/095374 relates to the use of mating type switching to improve the sexual behavior of filamentous fungal strains. Disclosed is the identification of mating types of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubigensis so as to transform Aspergillus niger into a heterothallic fungus, i.e. filamentous fungus individuals having opposite mating types resulting in one or more pair of strains with two opposite mating types.",
                        "Seidl et al. (2009) introduced the complementary mating type locus (MAT1-1) ectopically into T. reesei strain QM6a thereby generating a strain carrying both mating type loci (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2). This strain was fertile in crossings with wild type strains of the T. reesei teleomorph H. jecorina carrying either the MAT1-1 or the MAT1-2 locus. However, in crossings with strain QM6a and its derivatives (all MAT1-2) this strain was found to be sterile.",
                        "From these results\u2014that a QM6a strain carrying both mating types is able to form fruiting bodies with MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 strains of H. jecorina, but not with QM6a\u2014it is concluded that T. reesei QM6a is able to act as a male partner but that it cannot produce fruiting bodies and is therefore female sterile. Probably its maintenance in the labs for over 60 years without selective pressure acting to maintain mating competence has resulted in mutations in one or more of the genes necessary for sexual recombination.",
                        "Hence, there is a need in the prior art for a method that allows the rapid and efficient identification of genes associated with said mating impairment of a Trichoderma reesei QM6a strain. So far, the genes associated with mating impairment in the genome of Trichoderma reesei QM6a have neither been identified nor been characterized. The reason for this is mainly due to the fact that classical genetic approaches using sexual crossings have not been established for Trichoderma reesei QM6a due to its self-sterility. It is, moreover, not known which genes contribute to or account for the self-sterility of QM6a. So far, it is completely unknown which of the 9143 annotated genes in the genome of QM6a (34.1 Mbp) is associated with its self-sterility. The genome of T. reesei QM6a has been published in Martinez et al. (2008). The T. reesei nucleotide sequence and annotation data have been deposited in GenBank under accession number AAIL 00000000.",
                        "The present inventors have recently topically replaced the MAT1-2 locus of QM6a with the opposite mating type (MAT1-1) at the same genomic location, but crossings of the resulting MAT1-1 strains with T. reesei QM6a derived MAT1-2 strains were not successful demonstrating self-sterility.",
                        "It is, therefore, an object of the invention to identify and provide genes/genetic elements associated with the mating impairment in strains of T. reesei QM6a and its derivatives.",
                        "It is further an object of the invention to provide a process for the rapid and efficient identification of genes associated with mating impairment in T. reesei QM6a. It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for restoring the mating competence of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. It is a further object of the invention to provide a mating competent form of T. reesei QM6a and its derivatives. It is a further object of the invention to provide a process to sexually recombine genetic information of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. Another object of the invention is to prepare a strain of Trichoderma reesei QM6a or of a derivative thereof having a sexual cycle.",
                        "The inventors have surprisingly found that the mating impairment of a Trichoderma reesei strain QM6a or a strain derived thereof is caused by defined genes/genetic elements and mutations in defined genes/genetic elements of said organism and may be corrected by correcting or eliminating said mutations, i.e. by replacing the corresponding gene(s)/genetic element(s) with a functional counterpart or by inserting the gene/genetic element that is completely or partially missing. A functional counterpart of said gene(s)/genetic element(s) is a gene or genetic element that restores the mating ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a. Said capability is conferred to said gene/genetic element by correcting the mutations as depicted in Table 3 to such an extent that the gene or genetic element performs its function in the mating process. Preferably all mutations of the respective gene/genetic element are corrected.",
                        "It has further been found that for a Trichoderma reesei QM6a strain or any derivative thereof the technique of backcrossing may advantageously be used for identifying the genes or genetic elements that are associated with mating impairment in Trichoderma reesei QM6a or any derivative thereof (female sterility genes). Moreover, it has been found that mutations in certain genes are associated with mating impairment in Trichoderma reesei QM6a. The mutation may be a simple point mutation, an insertion or a deletion, whereby the deletion may be a deletion within an existing gene or a full or partial deletion of a gene/genetic element per se.",
                        "The above genes or genetic elements/genetic information may be contributory to mating impairment or may cause\u2014singly or in combination\u2014mating impairment in Trichoderma reesei QM6a. Hence, said genes/genetic elements/genetic information may be directly or indirectly associated with the mating impairment of said organism.",
                        "Genes or genetic elements/genetic information directly associated with the mating impairment of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives are generally genes of which the full or partial lack of functioning leads to a reduced or complete lack of formation of fruiting bodies when crossed with a corresponding organism. The term \u201cmating impairment\u201d is to relate to all degrees of an impaired or reduced mating ability. A reduced mating ability can thus also be seen in a substantially prolonged time until mature fruiting bodies with viable ascospores become visible. Corresponding genes and/or genetic elements have a direct impact on any organ or metabolic mechanism that has a direct impact on the mating ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives, such as for example genes coding for pheromone receptors or genes coding for organs needed for successful mating. A genetic element comprises genetic information that is not translated into a protein but is directly or indirectly related to the mating behaviour of Trichoderma reesei QM6a or its derivative. Said genetic information may be necessary for the control or regulation of the expression of a protein. A genetic element may be a promoter, an enhancer, an activator, a regulator or an expression control sequence.",
                        "Genes/genetic elements indirectly associated with the mating impairment of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives are genes which are not directly associated with the mating impairment of said organism but which relate to morphological structures or metabolic mechanisms that have an indirect impact on the ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives to mate with a corresponding organism. Mutations in genes for example related to hyphal cell wall structure or hyphal branching could have an indirect impact on the mating ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. The function of said genes may be executed by proteins encoded by said genes. Said gene/genetic element may also be necessary for expression or regulation of a corresponding protein (p. ex. promoter, enhancer, activator, regulator, initiator, expression control sequence)."

                        "The sequences of said gene(s) and the putatively encoded proteins per se were known and have been published in Martinez et al. (2008), but the function with respect to mating impairment of none of them has so far been verified. Moreover, the sequence of said genes may be retrieved from the NCBI data base under the accession number as specified in the sequence listing and the further link to the corresponding gene. SEQ ID NOs: 26, 72, 82, 84, 94, 96, 100, 70, 106, 120, 130, 140 and 154 have been newly annotated. Moreover, it has not been known that mutations in said genes are associated with the mating impairment and specifically with female sterility in said organisms. From said database, however, it is not evident that said sequences are mutated sequences in Trichoderma reesei QM6a or strains derived thereof thus being associated with a partial or full loss of mating competence in said organism and how to replace that gene by a functional one.",
                        "It has, however, not been known that the identified genes are associated with mating impairment in Trichoderma reesei QM6a. It has further been found that due to mutations, insertions or deletions said genes are associated with the mating impairment of Trichoderma reesei QM6a. Replacing said genes by the non-mutated and/or complete form will correct the mating inability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a, thus, allowing for the production of industrially important strains of QM6a by sexual crossing. Hence, the inventors have found genes which correct the inability of T. reesei QM6a MAT1-1 to mate with T. reesei QM6a MAT1-2. The inventors have been able to locate genes in Trichoderma reesei QM6a which in their presently existing form, which is considered to be a mutated form, are associated with mating impairment of said organism. The inventors have further found that Trichoderma reesei QM6a lacks several genes the presence of which is associated with mating competence and the full or partial loss of which is associated with mating impairment. Said mating impairment relates to any form of full or partial loss of the ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a to mate with a T. reesei MAT1-1 organism and, particularly, relates to the female sterility of said organism. Hence, said genes may also be considered as genes associated with female sterility in strains of Trichoderma reesei QM6a. By comparing said gene(s) with the corresponding gene(s) of the final mating competent progeny of the above process the corresponding functional genes could be retrieved. Said comparison reveals which gene deviation or lack of gene is associated with the observed mating impairment of said organism. Hence, the gene associated with mating competence, in particular female mating competence, may be used as a template for amending the corresponding gene of T. reesei QM6a, which is associated with mating impairment and female sterility, respectively.",

The mating impairment may be a full or a partial mating impairment of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. Preferably, the mating impairment relates to the female sterility of Trichoderma reesei QM6a or strains derived thereof. Mating impairment may relate to defects in any part or structure of the sexual cycle of ascomycetes as depicted in FIG. 3, for example fertilization, spermatogenesis or sex determination.",

This means that said genes and/or genetic elements may be contributory or causative for the respective type of mating impairment. The same holds for the mutations, insertions or deletions in the mutated form of the genes. Said deviations from the functional form may either be causative or contributory to mating impairment.",

The sequences are provided by sequencing the genes by methods known per se. The genes missing in Trichoderma reesei QM6a according to SEQ ID NOs: 163 to 174 may be inserted singly or in combination to restore the mating competence of Trichoderma reesei QM6a.

For this purpose, the degree of identity is preferably defined in the way that the number of residues of the shorter sequence which takes part in the comparison and which possesses a \u201ccorresponding\u201d complement in the other sequence is determined. The homology is preferably determined by the usual way using the usual algorithms. Only the cDNAs of the corresponding mature proteins are taken into consideration for the comparison.

Said strains may be obtained from known culture collections, such as CBS, ATCC, DSMZ.",
                        "In the process of the invention for identifying the genes associated with mating impairment there is provided a first parental strain being a Trichoderma reesei QM6a strain having a MAT1-2 locus or a strain derived thereof. Said strain is crossed with a second strain which is a mating competent strain of a Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) having a complementary MAT1-1 locus. Said strain has been obtained by selecting Hypocrea jecorina (the teleomorph of T. reesei) wild type isolates from international type culture collections such as CBS (Centralbureau for Schimmelcultures) or ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) for those possessing a MAT1-1 allele and which form fertile fruiting bodies when crossed with T. reesei QM6a and its derivatives, or other H. jecorina strains that bear the MAT1-2 allele. The formation of fertile fruiting bodies can be checked by simple tests, such as by checking whether the thus obtained ascospores are able to germinate. Preferred examples of said strain are the strain CBS999.97 MAT1-1 or any other mating competent MAT1-1 Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) strain such as those listed by Druzhinina et al. 2010.",
                        "To obtain a QM6a/MAT1-1 strain being capable of performing successful sexual reproduction using QM6a/MAT1-2 as mating partner, strain QM6a/MAT1-1 is transformed with plasmids containing the functional variant(s) of the gene(s) identified in association with mating impairment in strain T. reesei QM6a/MAT1-2. Positive transformants were subjected to mating assays with T. reesei QM6a MAT1-2. Mating was verified by the formation of fertile fruiting bodies. Their fertility was tested by isolating ascospores and demonstrating that they, upon germination and growing into a mycelium, are capable of mating with the opposite mating partner.",
                        "Specifically, positive transformants of T. reesei QM6a/MAT1-1 complemented with repaired candidate gene(s) and T. reesei strain QM6a/MAT1-2 (ATCC13631) are co-cultured under suitable mating conditions for Trichoderma reesei. An exemplary protocol is given in Example 3. The fertility is tested by isolating ascospores from the fruiting bodies, germinating them and demonstrating that the resulting colonies are capable of mating. A positive mating outcome is verified by a visible morphological change, a cell-to-cell fusion and the formation of a dikaryon.",
                        "Since natural H. jecorina MAT1-1 strains can be crossed with T. reesei QM6a and derivatives and produce fertile fruiting bodies, whereas this does not happen with a T. reesei strain in which MAT1-2 has been exchanged against MAT1-1, the inventors concluded that the genome of T. reesei QM6a must contain certain genomic features responsible for this failure. Thus, the responsible genomic features and the corresponding genes could\u2014in theory\u2014be identified by sequencing the genome of one of the H. jecorina MAT1-1 strains. However, there is a serious obstacle against this strategy: wild-type strains of T. reesei and H. jecorina show on the average a 0.5-1.5% nucleotide variation in their genome. Given that the genome is 34.1 Mbp, this means that any two wild type strains of T. reesei and/or H. jecorina will be different in 170500-511500 nucleotides. Even though the majority of them will not occur in genes, and\u2014if still so\u2014may result in silent mutations, the number of genes that show a non-silent nucleotide exchange are likely too many to be used to identify the genes related to female sterility.",
                        "It was, therefore, decided to reduce this background of nucleotide differences by several repeated crossings of T. reesei QM6a first against H. jecorina MAT1-1, and subsequently against a strain from the resulting progeny. Owing to the laws of genetics, the progeny of a sexual cross should have 50% of the genome from the MAT1-1 parental strain and 50% of that of the MAT1-2 parent strain. When one of these offsprings with MAT1-1 is then again crossed, this will further reduce the genome content derived from the MAT1-1 strain by 50%, i.e. 25% of the original after 2nd round of crossings. Further rounds will lead to 12.5 (3rd), 6.25 (4th), 3.125 (5th) 1.56 (6th), 0.78 (7th) and 0.39% (8th round) of content derived from the original MAT1-1 genome. In view of the fact that T. reesei/H. jecorina have 9143 annotated genes, this reduces the number of candidate genes to test to 357, of which not all will bear a nucleotide difference between T. reesei and the MAT1-1 strain from the 8th crossing generation. However, in order to even reduce this further, the progeny arising from the third crossing were separated into two strains that were separately crossed up to the eighth generation. In each step, the ability of the arising MAT1-1 progeny to still be capable of producing fertile fruiting bodies with QM6a was verified.",
                        "The backcrossing is repeated until a strain is obtained that is substantially identical to the parental strain, i.e. the first strain, by mathematical calculation: the backcrossing may be repeated for more than 8 cycles, if a higher likelihood of arriving at the correct genes is desired. Theoretically, a total of 19 back-crosses would be needed to arrive at a percentage of the MAT1-1 genome of 0.00014% (=1/9143; 9143 is the number of annotated genes in the T. reesei genome). The backcrossing is usually repeated for 5 to 19 cycles, preferably 6 to 12 cycles, more preferably 7 to 10 cycles, still more preferably 8 to 9 cycles and most preferably for 8 cycles. Hence, a strain that is substantially identical to the parental strains is defined in relation to the number of backcrossings that said strain has undergone. This means that the substantial identity between the backcrossed and the parental strain relates to the relationship between the genes associated with mating impairment and genes not associated with mating impairment as mathematically calculated on the basis of the number of backcrossings.",
                        "The progeny from the above back-crossing that is mating competent for crossing with a Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) having a MAT1-2 locus and contains the unmutated form of the genes for mating impairment/female sterility and/or a gene/genetic information not present in Trichoderma reesei QM6a is selected by first identifying those strains from the progeny that contain the MAT1-1 locus, and then verifying that it can produce fertile fruiting bodies with T. reesei QM6a (MAT1-2) by methods known per se.",
                        "Although by following the backcrossing strategy as outlined above it is basically feasible to obtain any combination of desirable genes (also the Female Sterility genes) transferred from the MAT1-1 background to the Trichoderma reesei QM6a lineage, use of the backcrossing strategy should be combined with a knock-out strategy to arrive at a mating competent QM6a strain or derivative carrying only the minimal set of complementing and defined female sterility genes as is obtained following the invention described.",
                        "Due to the randomness of genetic recombination it becomes increasingly unlikely to retain a defined set of desired genes from the MAT1-1 background and at the same time loose all the undesired background genes with no relevance to mating. Therefore after a certain advanced backcrossing generation the likelihood of loosing a female sterility gene in a crossing becomes greater than the likelihood of loosing a non-mating associated gene and the chance to obtain mating competent progeny with the minimal set of required female sterility genes will be miniscule. It is then therefore favourable to stop at an earlier point in a sequence of backcrosses with still numerous genes from the MAT1-1 female sterility gene donor non relevant to mating being retained in the resulting mating competent progeny.",
                        "Another disadvantage of attempting to generate mating competent Trichoderma strains merely by a backcrossing strategy will be that because of the necessity to stop at a stage where all female sterility genes have been assembled in a genome together with numerous random non-mating relevant genes from the MAT1-1 donor genome, every line will be different from another line generated in the same way with respect to these non-mating relevant genes, creating undesired heterogeneity. The use of the backcrossing strategy leads to a pool of candidate genes associated with mating impairment. Said pool of candidate genes is further refined by a targeted knock-out of each identified gene in a mating competent QM6a MAT 1-1 strain of Trichoderma reesei and the determination of the mating capability of the thus obtained Trichoderma reesei QM6a MAT 1-1 strain using the above described mating assay.",
                        "Since it is possible that more than a single gene associated with mating has become non-functional in T. reesei QM6a, and consequently the complementation with single genes would not lead to a gain of mating functionality, knock-out strains for all candidate genes in a mating competent T. reesei QM6a derivative were prepared. In this way any genes essential for mating would be identified whether solely responsible for mating deficiency in QM6a or being part of a group of inactivated essential mating genes. To this end, preferably a tku70 deleted version of strain CBS1/A8\u201402 (MAT1-1) is generated. The tku70 gene is part of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway present in Trichoderma reesei and other filamentous fungi. The knockout of the tku70 gene leads to an increased homologous recombination efficiency of Trichoderma reesei (Guangtao et al. 2008) thus increasing the number of strains possessing the gene knocked-outs to be tested for their relevance in mating.",
                        "The knock-out of the tku70 gene as well as of the respective candidate genes may be accomplished by any technique that is suitable to render said gene inoperative such as partial, substantial or functional deletion, silencing, inactivation or down-regulation. Preferably a marker is inserted into the corresponding constructs to identify the corresponding knock-out organism. Corresponding techniques are known in the art. The knock-out organism allows to study the function of the knock-out gene, i.e. the mating behaviour of the organism.",
                        "In this way genes that when knocked-out do not abolish mating competence in mating competent strain CBS1/A8\u201402 \u0394tku70 (MAT 1-1) are identified as non-essential for mating and consequently removed from the list of candidate genes for female sterility in Trichoderma reesei.",
                        "The knock-out strategy may also be used to identify a mating-incompetent phenotype associated with the above-identified gene(s)/genetic elements. A mating-incompetent knock-out Trichoderma reesei QM6a strain is for example a wild-type Hypocrea jecorina strain in which the respective gene/genetic element as identified above has been rendered non-functional, for example by partial, substantial or functional deletion, silencing, inactivation or down-regulation. Corresponding methods are known per se.",
                        "The gene(s) associated with mating impairment is/are identified by sequencing the genome of the progenies selected as above and comparing it with the genome sequences of the parental strain T. reesei QM6a (the first strain as used above). To this end, the CLC Genomic Workbench (version 5.1, CLC bio, Arhus, Denmark) and de novo assembled with newbler (version 2.60, Roche/454, Brandford Conn., USA) and CLC Genomic Workbench was used to map the obtained sequences to the scaffolds of the T. reesei QM6a sequence scaffolds with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and r2cat (Husemann and Stoye, 2010). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (Indels) between the QM6a reference sequence and the aligned sequences of the two backcrossed lines were identified using a customized version of Mauve (Rissman et al., 2009). SNPs and Indels were mapped to QM6a coding sequences using custom R scripts. Candidate genes were then manually tested for silent mutations, and mutations that lead to a conserved amino acid exchange (e.g. E vs. D, V vs. I etc) that does not interfere with the function of the putative protein were discarded. The respective nature of the mutations of course depends on the type of Hypocrea strain that is used for backcrossing. Hence, different mutations in the respective genes may be obtained by using a different strain of Hypocrea. Common to all mutation sets identified in genes correcting mating inability of T. reesei QM6a and derivatives will be mutations correcting mating disabling mutations in the respective QM6a versions of the gene.",
                        "Large DNA insertions in the backcrossed line which are not present in the published T. reesei QM6a genome sequence were identified in the following way. The results of a nucleotide comparison by the BLAST program between the different genome sequences of the backcrossed lines and QM6a were analyzed to identify regions which are absent in the genome sequence of QM6a by using a custom R script for identification of these sequences. The sequences identified in this process were extracted and the translated nucleotide sequences were used to search the protein database at the NCBI by a BLASTX search to find regions of similarity between the sequences.",
                        "The verification of the respective mutation is the restoration of the mating ability of the organism as evidenced by the formation of mature fruiting bodies with viable ascospores when crossing Trichoderma reesei QM6a having a MAT1-1 locus with a corresponding MAT1-2 strain of the same type as used for backcrossing.",
                        "To obtain genes directly associated with mating impairment the above identified genes are inserted into a Trichoderma reesei QM6a having a MAT1-1 locus or a strain derived thereof and crossing said strain with Trichoderma reesei QM6a having a MAT1-2 locus or a strain derived thereof, whereby the formation of fruiting bodies by Trichoderma reesei QM6a having a MAT1-1 locus having inserted said gene or a strain derived thereof is indicative of said direct association of said gene with said mating impairment. In the same way the contributory effect of a genetic element vis-\u00e0-vis mating behaviour may be verified.",
                        "By the above technique, of course, not only genes associated with mating impairment/female sterility may be identified but any other target gene that is associated with one or more functionally testable phenotypic feature(s) may be identified. Moreover, other organisms such as, for example, microorganisms or plants may be used instead of the Trichoderma reesei strains in the above system provided that said organisms are mating competent.",
                        "On the basis of the prior art it was not to be expected that by reintroducing non-mutated and thus functional genes associated with mating impairment or even female sterility that had lost their function in T. reesei QM6a (MAT1-2) into T. reesei QM6a, wherein the MAT1-2 locus has been replaced by the MAT1-1 locus, restores its ability to mate with T. reesei QM6a (MAT1-2) and other MAT1-2 derivatives thereof. The introduction of the above identified genes into industrial Trichoderma strains together with replacing the MAT1-2 locus with a MAT1-1 locus renders these strains capable of crossing with any other T. reesei (MAT1-2) strain, thus allowing for a rapid process for identifying male or female sterility genes and basically any target gene of interest.",
                        "The knowledge about the correlation of sequence deviations as depicted in Tables 3 and 4 and their functional implication concerning an improvement of the mating ability of Trichoderma reesei QM6a may be used to construct specific probes or arrays comprising specific probes for testing other microorganisms for genes associated with fertility. On the basis of the information of Tables 3 and 4 Vector Kits may be provided allowing restoration of the genes associated with the mating ability.",
                        "The invention further relates to a fungal strain of the genus Trichoderma (Hypocrea) suitable for use in the industrial production of a product of interest, wherein the strain has been obtained as outlined above and has been transformed with a gene encoding a product of interest.",
                        "A product of interest may be any product that may be of industrial use. Examples are proteins or polypeptides being useful for research purposes, diagnostic purposes, therapeutic purposes such as, for example, hormones, immunoglobulins, vaccines, antibacterial proteins, antiviral proteins, enzymes etc., purposes of nutrition or for technical applications. Preferred examples of proteins or polypeptides are food enzymes such as, for example, polygalacturonidases, pectin methylesterases, xylogalacturonoidases, rhamnogalacturonidases, arabinofuranosidases, arabanases/arabinanases, amylases, phytases, xylanases, cellulases, proteases, mannanases, transglutaminases, etc., animal feed enzymes such as, for example, phytases, xylanases, endoglucanases, mannanases and proteases, as well as technical enzymes such as, for example, cellulases, proteases, amylases, laccases, oxidoreductases, etc. A product of interest may also be a biopolymer.",
                        "The industrial production of a product of interest by the above Trichoderma is known to a person skilled in the art and is carried out according to fermentation methods established for fungal strains of the genus Trichoderma. For expressing and secreting the product of interest, the Trichoderma strain is cultivated under conventional conditions for the expression and secretion of the product of interest. The fungus is therefor inoculated or, respectively, initially grown on agar plates and a spore suspension or a mycelial suspension are used as an inoculum for a submerged fermentation. The fermentation is carried out on media containing the required C sources and N sources as well as trace elements and mineral salts. If inducible promoters are used, the medium should also contain the inducers or their precursors. The fermentation is carried out under control of temperature and pH value as well as of further fermentation conditions such as redox potential, partial oxygen content, etc. A controlled management of further C sources and N sources as well as of other components of the medium may also be effected (fed batch method). At the end of the fermentation the culture liquid containing the product of interest is separated from the biomass by known physical methods and the product of interest is isolated during this process.",
                        "The above restoration of the mating competence of Trichoderma reesei QM6a is associated with several unique advantages. Said process allows transforming Trichoderma reesei QM6a into an organism that more closely resembles the wild-type. The process allows to combine two or more advantageous genetic traits in Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. Said traits are then transferred into the progenies of Trichoderma reesei QM6a and its derivatives. Hence, an already existing highly efficient producer of industrially interesting compounds may further be improved. The ability to cross strains of T. reesei can also be used to eliminate marker genes or other undesired genes which can be tested for by their phenotype, such as genes for secondary metabolism, pigment formation, undesired enzymes (e.g. proteases), morphology and asexual development and others.",

                                "The strain described by Seidl et al. (2009) harbors, beside the MAT1-2 locus, also the MAT1-1 locus. This strain is able to reproduce sexually with different MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 carrying wildtype strains but not with the parental strain T. reesei QM6a (MAT1-2). To exclude that the still existing MAT1-2 locus (which resides at the original locus within the genome) is responsible for the malfunction of sexual reproduction in this strain, the MAT1-2 locus of T. reesei QM6a was directly and homologously exchanged by the MAT1-1 locus amplified from wildtype strain H. jecorina C.P.K. 1282 (G.J.S. 85-249). For the vector construction the MAT1-1 locus including upstream and downstream homolog regions was amplified from H. jecorina 1282 and cloned in the vector pCR blunt (obtainable from Life Technologies/Invitrogen). In a second step the hph gene (hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene) which confers resistance to Hygromycin was subcloned in the vector using the Avrll restriction site which is situated in the intergenic region between the gene mat 1-1-3 and the gene with transcript ID 59147 (endonuclease/DNA lyase). FIG. 1 gives a schematic overview of the vector construction and Table 1 gives the sequences of the primers used. Table 2 lists the exact positions of the genes within the MAT1-2 replacement vector. The complete sequence of the vector can be found in the Sequence listing as SEQ ID NO: 7.",

Per transformation reaction 10 \u03bcg of the replacement cassette were used. The resultant strain, which was named QM6a MAT1-2\u21c4MAT1-1, is able to act successfully as mating partner for MAT1-2 wildtype strains (e.g. CBS999.97) but mating with the parental strain T. reesei QM6a is not possible.",

Since first attempts showed that the wild type isolates differed from QM6a (whose sequence is publically available; http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html) in >60.000 SNPs, most of this background was removed by sexual crossing of QM6a with a MAT1-1 strain followed by repeated cycles of back-crossing of the MAT1-1 progenies with QM6a. To this end, strain QM6a (MAT1-2) was crossed with strain CBS999.97 (MAT1-1) in two independent lines to obtain sexually competent strains carrying the MAT1-1 locus. Cultures from single ascospores carrying the MAT1-1 locus were crossed back several times with the parental strain QM6a to reduce the number of CBS999.97 specific genes which will allow the easier identification of candidate genes responsible for female sterility (FS). By repeating this process over several generations two strains were generated which are nearly identical (>99% of their genome) to QM6a, but carry the MAT1-1 locus and are sexually competent. The genomes of the 8th generation of progeny from the two independent lines were then sequenced and by genome comparison candidate genes responsible for FS or necessary for fertility (e.g. CBS999.97 specific genes present in both lines) were identified.",
                                "Two libraries for each line were prepared, with 320 bp and 8 kbp insert size, respectively. DNA was fragmented using a Covaris S2 system (Covaris, Inc. Woburn, Mass.) and fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Paired-end libraries were prepared using the NEBNext DNA Sample Prep modules (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, fragments were end-repaired using Klenow and T4 DNA polymerases and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Fragments were then 3\u2032-adenylated using Klenow exo-DNA polymerase, and Illumina adapters were added using DNA ligase. Ligation products of \u02dc400 bp were gel-purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). To avoid guanine-cytosine (GC) bias introduced during the gel-purification step in the standard Illumina library preparation protocol, the gel slice was dissolved at room temperature instead of heating. The size-selected, adapter-modified DNA fragments were PCR-amplified using PE PCR primers 1.0 and 2.0 (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.) using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.) and protocol: polymerase activation (98\u00b0 C. for 30 s), followed by 10 cycles (denaturation at 98\u00b0 C. for 10 s, annealing at 65\u00b0 C. for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 50 s) with a final, 5-min extension at 72\u00b0 C.

The resulting scaffolds and singleton contigs were mapped to the scaffolds of the T. reesei QM6a sequence scaffolds with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and r2cat (Husemann and Stoye, 2010). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (Indels) between the QM6a reference sequence and the aligned sequences of the two backcrossed lines were identified using a customized version of Mauve (Rissman et al., 2009). SNPs and Indels were mapped to QM6a coding sequences using custom R scripts. As a result the following genes conferring female sterility to T. reesei QM6a were obtained (Table 3). Moreover the mutations in said genes that correlate with the observed mating impairment of T. reesei QM6a are indicated. Table 4 shows the genes that were found to be missing in Trichoderma reesei QM6a. Table 5 shows the genes associated with mating impairment in T. reesei QM6a as identified by the knock-out strategy."

Positive transformants were then subjected to potential mating with T. reesei QM6a MAT1-2, and verified by the formation of fertile fruiting bodies (their fertility was tested by isolating ascospores and demonstrating that they were capable of mating with the opposite mating partner).

The genomic differences between the mating competent strain obtained after backcrossing (CBS1/A8\u201402, MAT 1-1) and the mating deficient starting strain (QM6a, MAT 1-2) must, by definition contain the entirety of the required genes for functional complementation of mating. In addition the FS genes required must be shared by the endpoints of the 2 backcrossing lines (CBS1/A8\u201402, MAT 1-1 and CBS2/A8\u201411, MAT 1-1). Further the inactivation of FS genes in a mating competent background must debilitate functional mating. All these procedures were taken to arrive at a list of genes that when singly or co-introduced into Trichoderma reesei QM6a (MAT 1-1) will reconstitute mating competence.",

In this way any genes essential for mating would be identified whether solely responsible for mating deficiency in QM6a or being part of a group of inactivated essential mating genes. To this end, a tku70 deleted version of strain CBS1/A8\u201402 (MAT1-1) was generated. The knockout of the tku70 gene was achieved by crossing of strain CBS1/A8\u201402 (MAT1-1) with a tku70 deleted version of strain QM9414 (a mating incompetent descendant of T. reesei QM6a) which carries the resistance to pyrithiamin hydrobromide (ptrA) as selection marker.
