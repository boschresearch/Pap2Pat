                        "Microfluidic devices are used extensively for the capture, detection, classification, or quantification of molecules, molecular complexes, viruses, cells and particulates in environmental or biological samples. These devices include one or more microchannels of sub-millimeter (mm, 1 mm=10\u22123 meters) cross section formed in a chip of an inert material, which direct flow of one or more fluids from one or more corresponding reservoirs to interact with each other in a reaction chamber or at a detector or both.",
                        "Microfluidics technology has recently emerged as a powerful means to manipulate fluids at a microscale and fully integrate many components and steps for complex yet very precise biochemical analyses. Some of the promising applications include the development of inexpensive diagnostic devices that can be deployed in low-resource settings especially to meet global health challenges such as the lack of facilities and personnel to carry out medical diagnostics. Current microfluidic devices fall into either droplet-based (multiphase) or continuous-flow (single phase) systems. To successfully manipulate these fluids, a number of control strategies have been proposed which often require use of pumps and valves, either integrated on chip or off-chip. Even for integrated on-chip systems, the valves are controlled by external macro-scale elements, such as computers, and require power sources; thus limiting the usefulness of microfluidic tools in resource poor and field settings.",
                        "A majority of commercially available systems depend actively on external pumps, vacuum and pressure sources, or depend passively on capillary filling. These solutions are often prohibitively expensive for field deployment. Research and development of self-contained micro-valves and micro-pumps that are integrated into the system still generate systems that fall short when it comes to reliability and commercial viability. The reasons for some of these challenges include the dominance of surface effects over volume effects at the microscale level\u2014leading to increases in required driving pressure, large frictional forces that must be overcome and bubbles acting as capacitances which absorb the actuator-generated pressure. Such effects make it difficult to make micro-pumps that can prime themselves (e.g., see J. D. Zhan, Methods in Bioengineering, Biomicrofabrication and Biomicrofluidics). In addition, current systems are designed for single use. While fabricating the devices in a large batch may help reduce the costs, clean-room processes and material costs can quickly add to the cost and are typically not available near resource-poor deployments. Moreover, running a complex protocol often requires a very complex device design and/or highly skilled personnel to carefully run through multiple steps with a low error rate.",

In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.",
                        "Some embodiments are described below in the context of microfluidics with just manual power. However, the invention is not limited to this context and may be used with electrical, gravitational, geothermal or other sources of power. Furthermore, some embodiments are described with the chip above the actuators driven by the punch card; however, in other embodiments the chip with microfluidic channels is beside or below the actuators. Many illustrated embodiments are also described in the context of two phase flow with water based fluids flowing as droplets in oil as an immiscible carrier fluid. However, in other embodiments other immiscible fluids are used, or single phase fluid flow (also called \u201ccontinuous flow\u201d) is utilized.",
                        "As used herein a microfluidic channel is a leak-resistant channel having at least one dimension in a size range from about 0.1 micron to about 1000 microns. For brevity, the term \u201cmicrochannel\u201d is used interchangeably with the term \u201cmicrofluidic channel.\u201d A microfluidic device is a material object in which is formed one or more microfluidic channels. The term \u201cmicrofluidic chip\u201d is used interchangeably with the term \u201cmicrofluidic device.\u201d For brevity, a microfluidic chip is herein often referred to simply as a \u201cchip.\u201d A microfluidic protocol refers to a sequence of fluid movements in the microfluidic channels of a chip, and is also called simply a protocol herein for brevity. Thus a protocol implements a method on a chip. Protocols include assays that determine the existence or amount of a substance in a sample.",
                        "A punch card is a sheet of one or more layers of one or more materials on which persistent features, such as dimples and holes, can be punched or pressed or embossed or carved or otherwise imposed on the sheet. In some embodiments the punch card is of limited width and length (e.g., length about twice the width). In other embodiments, the punch card is of limited width but is extended substantially in length (much larger than twice the width) and is called a punch card tape or punch tape. Any material can be used to make the punch card, such as punched paper formerly used to input computer instructions, laminated paper, other papers such as card stock paper, Manila paper, sandpaper, Kraft paper available from Georgia-Pacific in Atlanta, Georgia and other derivatives of Kraft paper such as sack kraft paper, spinning kraft paper and hunting cartridge paper, leather, metal such as aluminum foil or other thin, flexible variations, cloth such as millinery buckram or bookbinding buckram other cloths stiffened in ways such as soaking in a substance such as pyroxylin or starch, or various polymers, such as Mylar\u00ae available from Tekra Corporation, New Berlin, Wisc., and other materials, alone or in some combination. The term \u201cpunch card\u201d is meant to refer to all such embodiments described in this paragraph.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cactuator\u201d refers to a component that causes, or is able to cause, a fluid in a microchannel to move. While actuators that revolve around a shaft are primarily depicted, other actuators that rock back and forth may also be used in some embodiments, along with, or instead of, actuators that revolve through 360 degrees around a shaft. In either case, the actuators are said to rotate relative to an actuator support structure and, thus, to be rotatably connected to the support structure.",
                        "A microfluidic actuation apparatus is described which reads features on a punch card to sequence in an arbitrary fashion (program), or to power, or both, fluid flow in a microfluidic chip. This simple solution allows for arbitrarily complex protocols to be executed by a chip without any requirement of external pumps, valves or even electricity. Different protocols are executed in a single chip by using different punch cards. In some embodiments, different protocols employ different chips and corresponding punch cards.",
                        "Some embodiments include a microfluidic chip that includes inputs and an output with channels in predefined locations for various functions. One part of the channel location is an actuator interaction region where an actuator external to the chip compresses the microchannel to propel or retard the flow of fluid in the microchannel. Some actuators include teeth (also called spokes) on a gear wheel to make contact with the channels in the actuator interaction region at a predefined height so as to push the fluids in them in each instance when engaged. The actuator in these embodiments is rotated by advancing a stiff paper punch card containing holes punched in predefined positions, so as to determine when the gear teeth are engaged thereby programming the instances when the fluid in the microfluidic channels is propelled forward. In a multi-phase set of these embodiments, the chip embodies a microfluidic design incorporating the use of T-junctions, an oil line of a predetermined flow rate, and other lines with other media so as to generate droplets which can then be manipulated as desired, corresponding to the programmed punch card.",
                        "Some embodiments disclosed here include a microfluidic movement system which is completely programmable, but requires no electricity or any other external control system. Numerous applications exist in ultra-low-cost biomedical devices, point of care diagnostic devices, research tools for automated pipetting of fluids, drug screening devices and so forth. The system is general purpose and operates in both single phase and multi-phase microfluidic modes. The system can be used in environmental monitoring applications which require conducting sophisticated molecular tests in a field setting. One or more components of the disclosed system are amenable to on-demand manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) printing.",
                        "Some embodiments are used to manipulate fluids in innumerable ways simply by programming the same chip with a different punch card; e.g., for a new protocol. Re-programming just involves using a different punch card. The technology does not require any batteries or any other source of electricity; and thus eliminates the need for electric power. The technology does not require any external pumps to drive the fluid; since the motion of the gear train drives fluid automatically into and through the system.",
                        "The use of punched cards for creating, editing and storing computer programs continued up until the mid-1980s. However, means to use programs on punch cards to drive microfluidic channels without intervening electronic controls has not been suggested or demonstrated before.",
                        "Current approaches toward microfluidics programmability include the use of valve-based systems, such as the use of multiple micromechanical valves, each valve being separately controlled by an off-chip solenoid valve (e.g., see E. C. Jensen, B. P. Bhat and R. A. Mathies, Lab Chip, 2010, 10, 685-691). Another approach has been the use of thin film metal flexures in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices to electronically control the opening and closing of specific valves without the use of any pressure (e.g., see M.-P. Chang and M. M. Maharbiz, Lab Chip, 2009, 9, 1274-1281). By designing the location of the valves and channels, fluid flow can be programmed.",
                        "However, the valve based systems are often single phase systems. Maintaining sample integrity in continuous flow systems has been a major challenge due to the ease with which samples that are not meant to mix can come into contact. Multi-phase systems, such as droplet-based systems, solve this problem by containing solutions of interest as emulsions in immiscible carrier fluids, thereby avoiding direct contact with device walls or with other samples until desired through specific manipulations. Multiphase systems have therefore been employed to program fluid flow using means such as the manipulation of conductive droplets using electrical means in electrowetting-on-dielectric microfluidic devices (e.g., see M. J. Jebrail and A. R. Wheeler, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 2010, 14, 574-581; and S.-K. Fan, T.-H. Hsieh and D.-Y. Lin, Lab Chip, 2009, 9, 1236-1242).",
                        "Further disadvantages arise in these current systems when it comes to the limitations arising from the difficulty in integrating and miniaturizing components for increased density. Moreover, the programming process is extremely challenging, requiring exceptional knowledge and skills in microfabrication and physics for each design. Moreover, in some instances, the valves require external control for each valve leading to the need of an external controller, such as a computer, with increased complexity and cost, and often require highly trained personnel to operate.",
                        "Other approaches for controlling microfluidics mechanically include using human input such as thumb-actuated devices for pumping fluids in various compartments for storing the fluids. This approach does not allow for arbitrary control since only a limited number of inputs (two) can be given. Moreover, programmability is not possible with the above-described scheme (e.g., see X. Qiu, J. A. Thompson, Z. Chen, C. Liu, D. Chen, S. Ramprasad, M. G. Mauk, S. Ongagna, C. Barber, W. R. Abrams, D. Malamud, P. L.A.M. Corstjens; and H. H. Bau, Biomed Microdevices, 2009 December; 11[6]: 1175-1186). Furthermore, the user must be trained to perform the functions and highly practiced to perform them adeptly. The thumb-driven approach is also limited in that reagent introduction is complex and limited. Furthermore, great limitations exist in the complexity of the programs that can be run.",
                        "Moreover, most, if not all of the above listed current approaches also feature programs and chips that are tightly connected, making it practically impossible to have simple chips running complex programs. The needed supportive architecture for current complex programmable microfluidic devices includes expensive equipment, such as computers or electronic hand-held devices, and an external power supply for fluid handling and processing. All such characteristics make such systems expensive and practically prohibitive for field-based approaches in low-resource settings.",
                        "Programmability of microfluidic systems described here presents the capacity to run countless protocols through a single chip and actuator apparatus design. Illustrated embodiments present a way to program microfluidic systems using a simple chip design. Fluids can be manipulated arbitrarily by programming an external actuation apparatus that is coupled to the chip. Various embodiments use a programmable punch card coupled to a hand-powered gear train that serves as a pump to drive fluid in a microfluidic chip from outside the chip. This capacity, coupled with a droplet-based, two-phase system, also provides the possibility of reusing the same device for multiple complex protocols by simply changing the punch card code.",
                        "The illustrated embodiments provide solutions that require no electrical power, yet can perform highly complex, programmable and/or parallel fluid manipulations for various assays in simple reusable chips. The approach disclosed here embeds complexity in the punch card tape (physical program) that serves as both a program and storage register and power transmission.",
                        "Some embodiments comprise a device capable of being modified to run at very high speeds for materials processing at a high throughput. In some embodiments, the designs for microfluidic chips expand the number of programming functions available on chip. Still other embodiments comprise devices capable of being made completely disposable to allow for one time use, such as for infectious diseases related applications. Some embodiments are capable of replacing the common pipettes used in lab settings or provide the advantage of a much more precise mechanism, or some combination. Some embodiments also offer the advantage of sharing the punch card program between individuals.",
                        "New features of various embodiments include: (1) Coupling of a microfluidic chip to a punch card; (2) Actuation of fluids purely driven by interaction with a gear train eliminating any external pumps; and (3) Programmable microfluidics that can operate in harsh field settings including developing countries, hospitals, environmental monitoring, etc.",
                        "Thus, various embodiments provide a novel, elegant and a highly accurate way to manipulate fluids at microscopic length scales in a completely programmable fashion. Each protocol can be broken down into a set of instructions that are punched onto the tape and which are mechanically read by an actuator apparatus and transferred to compressions on microchannels in the microfluidic chip. This opens the possibility of lightweight, hand-held diagnostic devices that can operate in harsh settings without the need for electricity, while still providing complex fluidic manipulation of high precision useful for many applications.",
                        "An illustrated system comprises several parts: a microfluidic chip made using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with various input and output channels in a predetermined configuration, a stiff paper or other material with parallel lines spaced apart running parallel to the long edge, and an actuator apparatus. The actuator apparatus includes a bedplate metal support structure on which actuators and the supporting pieces are fastened. Example actuators include gear wheels with a cylinder or shaft having rotatably connected metallic disks each with teeth that are spaced circumferentially, or cams that move one or more pins up and down under a restoring force such as gravity or shape memory material or an external spring. In some embodiments, the teeth are spaced equally around the circumference. In various embodiments, various numbers of teeth are included on each actuator. In various embodiments, the teeth are shaped for various purposes, such as to engage the punch feature, compress channels, close channels like a valve or puncture a capsule in a punch feature or some combination. In some embodiments, different actuators in different rows have different numbers and types of teeth or different sizes.",
                        "In an illustrated embodiment, a stiff paper card is punched with holes, or other features, such as bumps or depressions, on the lines, which are aligned to the teeth on an actuator (such as a cylinder with multiple gears) and about two millimeters apart in an illustrated embodiment. In other embodiments, other spacings between lines are used. The spacings between the actuators in several illustrated embodiments are created using toroid discs made of plastic that are one and a half millimeters thick and are completely replaceable and adjustable. It is anticipated that thinner spacings are used in some embodiments to provide more actuators and therefore more channels for a given area. The opposite would also be true that is, if thicker spacings are used, fewer actuators would fit and subsequently fewer channels would be actuated for a given area. More closely packed actuators and channels at some point eventually lead to more than one channel being perturbed or actuated by an actuator, which may or may not be desirable depending on the application. The point where more than a single channel is perturbed by the action of a single actuator also depends on the thickness of the tooth on the actuator. Thinner teeth result in a lower likelihood of neighboring channels being perturbed for a particular density.",
                        "An illustrated embodiment features actuators with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 mm to 1 mm, spaced 2 mm apart. The actuator thickness in this embodiment is such that it is slightly larger than the channel being actuated to ensure that channel collapse is substantively complete. The thickness of the teeth or pins can also be increased or decreased arbitrarily compared to the thickness of the actuator. The limits for thin teeth or pins is determined partly by the material being used and its interaction with the material of the microchip and the size of microchip channels and substrates; if too thin, the tooth or pin can cut though the material which may be undesirable for channels that need to be intact for correct functioning.",
                        "Upon encountering a punch feature on the punch card, a tooth of the actuator gets engaged and rotates the actuator, pressing another tooth of the actuator, or a pin motivated by the tooth, to compress a microchannel in the chip. The other actuators are not engaged (unless there is a feature on the punch card on the particular line for another actuator at the same distance on the punch card). As one of the teeth on the actuator engages the feature, another tooth on the actuator, e.g., a tooth 180 degrees from the tooth engaging the punch feature, compresses the microfluidic channel on the chip mounted on another side of the actuators. The microchannels are aligned with the actuators' teeth so that the microchannel can be compressed every time the punch card has a feature at the particular line and distance. The distance along the length of the punch card corresponds to a sequence step or time.",
                        "In some embodiments, the microfluidic channels include at least one microchannel with a carrier fluid flowing at a predetermined flow rate, e.g., because of regular compression by one or more actuators due to regular spacing of features on the punch card. This carrier fluid is immiscible with the fluids in other channels. The input channels are designed in such a way as to have a T-junction with a microchannel carrying the immiscible fluid. For example, the input channels carry a water-based fluid while the immiscible carrier fluid is oil. The design is such that droplets can be generated at the T-junction through the shearing of the fluid whenever the tooth of an actuator pushes the fluid forward in a pulsatile way.",
                        "Fluids in the various droplets are manipulated as desired through various designs in the microfluidic chip, including but not limited to ways of passively mixing the fluids in any order in a reaction chamber or laminar flow channel or merging various fluid droplets in the reaction chamber as desired for various applications.",
                        "FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B are block diagrams that illustrate example microfluidic channels as depicted on a microfabrication mask, according to an embodiment. This presents channels in a plan view. A chip so produced includes multiple microchannels 110, including an immiscible carrier fluid line (e.g., oil line 120) with inlet or port to a reservoir (e.g., oil inlet 122). The remaining microchannels 110 include one or more sample fluid microchannels 130 and corresponding inlets or ports to reservoirs (e.g., sample fluid inlets 132) for a sample fluid (such as water with one or more suspended or dissolved components) that connect to the immiscible fluid line at corresponding T-junctions, such as T-junction 140 for a water line 131 and oil line 120 on chip 100. The oil line ends at outlet 150. One design includes a setup where droplets can be generated at the T-junction through the shearing of the fluid whenever an actuator tooth pushes the fluid forward in a pulsatile way at the location of a hole or other feature in the punch card. In some of these embodiments, the T-junction includes a channel narrowing as depicted in junction 140. Fluids in the various droplets may then be manipulated as desired through various designs in the microfluidic chip, including but not limited to ways of passively mixing the fluids and merging various fluid droplets as desired for various applications. In other embodiments, no immiscible fluid is used, and all fluid channels 110 carry compatible fluids for a continuous flow (single phase) application that combined to form laminar flow in a downstream channel.",
                        "In the illustrated embodiment, the chip is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is inert, flexible at certain thicknesses, and transparent so that fluid reactions can be observed visually. In some embodiments, material coatings are employed to avoid or reduce wear and tear, including polymer coating to match material stiffness/hardness. An example of such an approach is the coating of actuator teeth in a polymer or material that will match the microchip stiffness/hardness. In some embodiments, mechanisms are included to reduce friction, such as timed release of a friction-reducing agent; or the use of other materials for the microchip, the actuator or both, leading to reduced friction. The channels can be formed in various ways in the material of the chip, in one block or multiple blocks that are then glued or melted together, such as by machining each block of material, etching each block, using a mold for one or more blocks, or injection molding one or more blocks, or by 3D printing with the chip material.",
                        "FIG. 2A is a block diagram that illustrates an example cross-sectional view of microfluidic chip 100 inserted in an actuation apparatus, according to an embodiment. FIG. 2A depicts, in a cross section, one channel 110 in the chip 100 of the channels 110 depicted in plan view in FIG. 1B. The channel height h 112 is indicated. In various embodiments, the channel height h 112 is less than one millimeter, and advantageously for small sample sizes, about 50 to 100 microns. Channel height considerations are made with the applications in mind. For instance, when working with and analyzing human cells, channels that are 10 microns or less in height will be disadvantageous as they are likely to result in shearing and destruction of the cells during the actuation action, and blockage of channels. However, such small channels can be advantageous in the encapsulation of single simple cells in single droplets for single-cell analysis. One can envision a setup whereby the channels have a smaller height downstream from the actuation location to take advantage of the capacity to easily manipulate single cells while still reducing the instances where cells may be destroyed by shearing. Channels featuring greater heights such as 200 microns offer the advantage of being able to process larger volumes of fluids which can be advantageous for instance in the processing of large volumes of blood (for instance 10 milliliters) in search of circulating cancer tumor cells, which are rare, and found in patients with tumors that may be undergoing metastasis. The number of these cells has been found to correspond to disease progression and response to therapy, and may perhaps be used someday for disease diagnosis. The larger volumes are also useful in a search for proteins found in low quantities for disease diagnostics in the case of diseases such as Alzeheimer's disease, where tau proteins have been found in cerebro-spinal fluid.",

Further design considerations allow for repeatable operation for a large variation of tape travel velocity, making the various device embodiments robust.",

The vertical axis indicates the height (h) (e.g., h 112 in FIG. 2) in millimeters of an actuator penetration into a sample fluid microchannel (e.g., one of microchannels 120 or 422 or 423). The different areas indicate different rates of entrainment of fluid from the sample fluid microchannel as measured during an experiment. Given that the fluid channel dimensions are known, the dispensed volume was determined by measuring the droplet lengths and using this value to calculate the volume. Other parameters include the number of droplets with each actuation, determined by simply counting.

For example, the embodiment of FIG. 3A is shown in operation. A user rotates the crank 350 to rotate the shaft 342, which rotates the actuator 330 for the immiscible fluid channel and advances the punch card tape 770 that has holes at regular intervals in line with the immiscible fluid channel. In some embodiments, a line of punch features is not used to propel the immiscible carrier fluid. Instead, that carrier fluid line is propelled with a gear teeth design that ensures that it is constantly running, e.g., fixed to the shaft that advances the punch card or via the wind-up mechanism detailed in FIG. 3C, or through hydrostatic action from an external reservoir, e.g., manually using a syringe or via a syringe pump as depicted in FIG. 3D.",
                        "Initial multi-phase flow experiments with the illustrated embodiment have demonstrated the successful generation of droplets ranging from five to 20 nanoliters. FIG. 8 is a photograph that illustrates example droplet generation, according to an embodiment. As teeth 332 on actuators press on fluid channels, droplets 810 are introduced downstream of T-junctions into the flow of the immiscible fluid (e.g., oil). Results from experimental embodiments reveal that the number of droplets generated by the device for each amount of water-based solvent released depends on the flow-rate of the oil line, as plotted in FIG. 6. As the oil line flow rate increases, so does the number of droplets generated for a particular actuation height due to the increased shearing rate as the water-based solvent pierces the oil line at the T-junction. The droplet size in these embodiments is found to be inversely proportional to the droplet frequency for a constant water-based solution and varying oil flow rate. These results are consistent with those found in other similar experiments (e.g., see P. Garstecki, I. Gitlin, W. DiLuzio, G. M. Whitesides, E. Kumacheva, and H. A. Stone, Formation of monodisperse bubbles in a microfluidic flow-focusing device, Applied Physics Letters, 85 [13]).

The example actuator 1030 has four teeth 1032, each with a rounded leading edge; and, therefore, actuator 1030 has 90 degree symmetry. When no tooth of the actuator is engaged with the punch card 1070, e.g., where there are no punch features in the punch card 1070, the actuator is at an angle theta (\u03b8) of 0, as shown by \u03981033 in FIG. 10A with the leading edge of one tooth nearly or barely in contact with the microchannel 1010. The actuator 1030 stays at that orientation until a punch feature engages a tooth opposite to the tooth (barely) in contact with microchannel 1010 at \u0398=0. As a punch feature comes upon an opposite tooth of the actuator at \u03b8=0, that tooth drops into the punch feature as shown in FIG. 10B. As the punch card moves, the actuator 1030 rotates and the tooth originally barely in contact with the microchannel 1010 deforms the flexible substrate of the microchannel, compressing the microchannel and any fluid therein, and proceeds to sweep through to \u03b8=90 degrees and a distance D 1036 along the microchannel, as depicted in FIG. 10C through 10G. When the punch feature moves out of reach of the opposite tooth, the actuator, because of its 90 degree symmetry, again matches the original configuration with a tooth barely or nearly in contact with the microchannel at \u03b8=0 degrees.",

The second tooth 1133 of each pair is a slanted pin shape. In some embodiments, the slanted pin-shaped tooth 1133 is used for valve action, to close off a channel before fluid is propelled by the other tooth 1132D of each pair. The three evenly distributed pairs of teeth provide 120 degree symmetry. This actuator can act both as valve and pump simultaneously, in some embodiments. In each pair, one tooth 1133 is used as a valve by closing the microchip channel while the other tooth 1132D positioned right behind tooth 1133 is used as a pump for propelling the fluids forward. When the propelling tooth 1132D is not engaged with a punched feature in the punch card, the valving tooth 1133 closes the microchannel. When the first tooth 1132D is engaged by the punch feature, the other tooth 11333 is moved away and opens the microchannel. The second tooth behind it then propels the fluid in the microchannel. Thus, one tooth 1133 of the plurality of teeth on an actuator of the plurality of actuators is configured to close a microfluidic channel of the plurality of microfluidic channels on the chip to prevent flow of a fluid in the microfluidic channel in a first direction along the microfluidic channel, and a different tooth 1132D of the plurality of teeth on the actuator is configured to propel the fluid in the microfluidic channel into the first direction along the microfluidic channel.",

In various embodiments, the diameter of actuators vary from a smaller diameter of about 3 mm, which translates to lesser material for the thick substrate (thickness will reduce by the same order of magnitude) and also a shorter distance between the microchannel and the punch card tape (which will make it easier to transfer material into and out of the chip). A larger diameter of about 16 mm makes it possible to get many more pulses with each cranking action as you can fit more gear teeth. In some embodiments, teeth with variations in height are used on the same actuator (e.g., alternating teeth with about a 30 micron height difference, such as the second, fourth, sixth and eighth teeth having a height of about 1500 microns from an axis of rotation while the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th teeth having a height of about 1520 microns).

From a center of an actuator 1030 to an outer edge of a tooth 1032 is a distance g 1223. The maximum distance that the tooth 1032 penetrates into the microchannel 1010 is the actuation height h1 1213 which may be less than or equal to h 1212.

The value of x is the width of the flexible substrate pushed into the microchannel by the tooth 1032, and is approximately equal to the width of the tooth 1032. The value of y is less than the actuation height h1, because the tooth moves from no penetration to the maximum penetration.

The backward arrow indicates that with each actuation, there is some fluid that flows backward as the penetration of the pin displaces it. It is somewhat akin to squeezing out toothpaste from a tube. One can consider this action as being comprised of two main steps: the squeezing, and then the pushing. The initial squeeze leads to some backward displacement as the pressure from the reservoir is lower than that exerted on the fluid during the actuation.",

FIG. 19 is a block diagram 1900 that illustrates an example three-layered chip 1901, according to an embodiment. The number of microchannels compressed within the chip depends on the actuation pressure of the teeth on the actuators. In the illustrated embodiment, the chip 1901 includes three layers of microchannels aligned with each actuator: microchannel 1910a; microchannel 1910b; and microchannel 1910c (collectively referenced hereinafter as microchannels 1910), all aligned with actuator 1930.

In an example embodiment, each flexible substrate is made of a thin layer of PDMS with a thickness in a range from about 10 microns to about 100 microns, with the potential to vary the thickness between the different channels. Thicker substrates can be advantageous in propelling in less fluid in the deeper channels where desirable, and vice versa. Thinner interfaces can result in more actuation with each action, across the different layers. In some embodiments, the first flexible substrate 1922a is thinner than the second or third flexible substrates 1922b or 1922c, e.g. is about 10 microns for the first flexible substrate 1922a compared to 50 microns for the other flexible substrates 1922b and 1922c.

The actuation height in the second microchannel 1910 is less than in the first layer, but enough to increase the pressure on, and at least slightly deform, the third flexible substrate 1922c into the third microchannel 1910c. This squeezes a volume of fluid in the third microchannel 1910c as well. With this capacity, multiple experiments can be carried out simultaneously with the possibility of either merging or not merging the various layers downstream in various embodiments.

                        "FIG. 26 is a block diagram that illustrates example valve action by tilting a microfluidic chip relative to bank of actuators 2630, according to an embodiment. In position 2601a, the actuator 2630 has its usual effect, either no compression when the actuator 2630 is not engaged with a punch feature in the punch card 2670, as illustrated, or compressing the microchannel in the chip to motivate fluid flow. In tilted position 2601b, however, the actuator 2630 has a different effect. When the actuator 2630 is not engaged with a punch feature in the punch card 2670, as illustrated, a tooth of the actuator now compresses the flexible substrate and closes the microchannel, serving as a valve to prevent motion, such as backflow, in the microchannel. Alternatively, an actuator that was engaged with the punch card and compressing a microchannel of the chip, loses compression of the microchannel leading to an end of the squeezing and an end to droplet formation or pipetting flow. Thus, the system is stopped. The tilting of the chip is thus occurring relative not only to the bank of actuators but also relative to the punch card 2670 in the punch card guide. The tilting of the chip depicted in FIG. 26 affects every microchannel in the actuator interaction region of the chip. Thus, the actuation apparatus is made so as to have multiple modes whereby actuation produces an \u201con\u201d outcome (where for instance, fluids are pumped in positions 2601a), or an \u201coff\u201d outcome (whereby fluid flow is stopped in position 2601b), or a bistable mode whereby depending on when the device is actuated or the code implemented, it can be in an off or on mode (e.g., by tilting between position 2601a and 2601b).",

The tilting is such that for a four-toothed actuator, with the channels in the microchip aligned to the actuator, the tooth closest to the microchannel impinges on the microchannel; thereby inducing a valving mechanism. At the neutral/default actuator position (not engaged with a punch feature, as depicted in FIG. 26), the channel is closed when in the tilted position 2610b thereby hindering fluid movement. Thus, in this embodiment, the punch card guide is rotatably connected to the support structure and the support structure is configured to tilt relative to the punch card guide so that microfluidic channels in the chip in the recess of the support structure are closed by teeth of corresponding actuators when no tooth of the corresponding actuator is engaged with a punch feature of the punch card.",

FIG. 27A through FIG. 27D are block diagrams that illustrate a valve 2570 controlled by an actuator 2730 to act in concert with compression of a microchannel 2710 by the actuator 2730, according to an embodiment. The channel 2710 is separated from the actuator 2730 by the flexible substrate 2722, as usual. The valve 2750 includes a pin 2752 on a cantilever. When the actuator 2630 is not engaged with a punch feature in the punch card 2670, as illustrated in FIG. 27A, the valve cantilever is positioned to be out of contact with any teeth of the actuator and to press pin 2752 against the flexible substrate 2722 to close the microchannel 2710. As the actuator 2730 engages the punch card and is rotated as depicted in FIG. 27B, a tooth of the actuator presses against a tip of the cantilever of valve 2750 and pushes the valve to position 2750b. This partially removes the pin 2752 from the channel while another tooth of the actuator compresses the fluid in the channel. The compressed fluid is allowed to pass downstream in the channel 2710. After the pin 2752 is fully withdrawn from the microchannel 2710 as the actuator 2730 completes the sweep of the channel 2710, as depicted in FIG. 27D, the valve in position 2750c loses contact with a tooth of the actuator 2730. The valve 2750 starts a return to its original position 2750d, as shown in FIG. 27D, which matches the configuration of FIG. 27A, closing the microchannel 2710.",
                        "Thus, a valve is moveably connected to the support structure. The valve includes a pin configured to extend into the recess sufficiently to close a microfluidic channel in the chip placed in the recess when no tooth of the plurality of teeth on an actuator is in contact with the valve and configured to withdraw from the recess when a tooth of the actuator is in contact with the valve. This valving mechanism uses pin-like projections or pins attached to individual cantilevers. The neutral position is such that the pins are aligned to microchannels and impinge upon them to obstruct flow. Complete closure of the channel with the pin is achieved through this action and, in some embodiments, the introduction of a step elevation in the microchannel at the point where the valving pin makes contact with the channel to reduce the channel height and makes it easier to seal the channel shut. The cantilevers are plucked upon the actuation of the actuator tooth with a punch feature on the punch card. The downward motion of the cantilever upon plucking causes the pin to move down and forward thereby lowering the pin and opening the channel to let out the fluid being pumped. Immediately after this action, the valve goes back to its default position thereby closing the channel.",

FIG. 28A give a perspective view, FIG. 28B an elevation view, and FIG. 28C a plan view. Dimensions are given in millimeters. These designs implement valves wherein each is aligned to a single actuator and microchannel and can be operated independently following the code that is programmed for the device.",
                        "With the above described action, the default is an valve on position leading to the closure of the microchannel. In some embodiments, a valve in the default position is off, e.g., through the use of a pulley mechanism, flexures, or coupling to other valves or structures. FIG. 29A and FIG. 29B are block diagrams that illustrate a valve that is open in a neutral position, according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, the valving mechanism consists of three main sections. The first section is a plank 2901 made of a rigid substrate (such as a metal or any kind, plastics or other rigid polymers), e.g., measuring 1.2 mm by 1.2 mm by 1.2 mm, attached on one end to a tine 2920 of a comb, which tine is plucked by the actuator 2960 when engaged (just as is the case with the \u201calways on\u201d valves described previously) and the other end is attached to another plank 2910 made of a rigid substrate, e.g., measuring 9 mm by 1.2mm by 1.2 mm, via a pin or hinge that allows for rotation on only one axis. This second/middle plank 2910 also has a hole (e.g., 1.2 mm in diameter) in the middle of its longest axis (e.g., 4.5 mm from each end) through which a cylindrical pin (e.g., 1 mm in diameter) is attached to the sides of the actuator support after running through all the middle sections for which this valving mechanism is implemented, serving as fixed pivot 2912. This middle section 2910 is then attached to a valving pin 2930 (e.g., 6 mm long), having a diameter that is at least the width of the channel that it closes via a hinge that allows for rotation in one axis. When the valve 2900 is not engaged with an actuator 2960, as depicted in FIG. 29A, the pin 2930 is low, keeping the channel open. When engaged with the actuator 2960, as depicted in FIG. 29B, the actuator tooth plucks the comb tine 2920 leading to the downward movement of the first plank 2901. The connection to the middle plank 2910 results in its movement downward on the side attached to the first part 2901 and the upward movement of the side attached to the valving pin 2930 thanks to the fixed pivot 2912. The end result is the upward movement of the valve pin 2930 thereby closing the channel.",

                        "FIG. 30 is a block diagram that illustrates a valve tooth 3033 on a rocking actuator 3030, according to an embodiment. This rocking actuator 3030 with teeth 3031 and 3032 behaves as described above with reference to FIG. 3C for actuator 236, and teeth 234 and 235, respectively. The actuator 3030 in the depicted configurations acts as a valve 3000 by the additions of tooth 3033, which causes the fluid channel 3010 to be open when the actuator tooth 3031 is not engaged with the punch card 3070. When the actuator tooth 3031 is engaged with the punch card 3070, the tooth 3033 impinges on channel 3010 and closes it, As the punch card 3070 advances, the valve tooth 3033 drops away from the channel 3010, as the tooth 3032 pushes the fluid along the channel. Thus the valve closes the channel to prevent backflow until the fluid in the channel is propelled by the tooth 3032 of actuator 3030.",

In various embodiments, the punch card has multiple coding schemes to correspond to different steps of the process or purposes of the platform. For instance, one code corresponds to the engagement of gears to perform a certain logical operation, another code corresponds to opening and closing one or several valves, and another code corresponds to engaging a single phase in lieu of multiple-phase flow, and still other code corresponds to either the uptake of new material (either from reservoirs and or external sources) or the deposit of processed material/results for storage or additional processing. In some embodiments information is stored either in the form of assay products, color changes, numerical revelations corresponding to particular results, the outputs of a particular stage in the assay or other products.

Assays such as those for the diagnosis of infectious diseases (that require multiple steps, incubation, etc.) or the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic, to both determine the resistance of a microbe to the antibiotic or test out new drugs, are some of the potential applications of embodiments of the device. Moreover, the illustrated embodiments can potentially be used for the screening of newborns for multiple disease conditions that are treatable but not evident clinically\u2014which can lead to many lives being saved as such programs are often non-existent in low resource settings. Other applications include the parallel testing of many chemotherapeutic agents against a particular cancer to determine the most effective medication or combination of medications for a particular case; drug discovery; screening pregnant women for common health risk factors; quick determination of the right antivenom for snake bites by parallel processing; and determining the best approach in treating patients with comorbidities, especially those that are immune-compromised, through the parallel processing of biological samples.",

Using various embodiments, a moving display of text, numbers, patterns or various images can be made by punching holes to program the fluid flow on the microfluidic chip. Multiple channels can then be simultaneously controlled in this way. The display can be on the chip itself enabling the transmission of messages as the fluid is driven by hand. By merging or layering the output from multiple device layers complex images, colors and patterns can be displayed.

                        "In an example embodiment, an assay provides for the parallel staining of cells with different fluorescent markers for disease diagnosis. For instance, parallel chambers are chemically functionalized to have chemical tags such as avidin bound to the surface of the device. A biological fluid sample such as blood or cerebro-spinal fluid is introduced after the surface markers of interest in the cell have been tagged with a molecule such as biotin that attaches the cell to the surface of the device chamber. With the cells immobilized, different stains are introduced in different chambers at the exact sequence required, all in parallel complete with all the rinsing, incubation and staining steps. The cells are then fixed and imaged to identify them. An example of such a protocol is the hematoxylin and eosin stain in which the cells are first rinsed with saline solution and then hematoxylin is introduced for 15 minutes. The excess dye is then rinsed off for 20 minutes followed by a counterstain with eosin for two minutes. After the final rinse, the cells are then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before imaging. While this is happening in one chamber, a gram stain is run in another chamber, while yet another chamber has markers specific to certain cells, such as CD45 for hematopoietic cells except red blood cells. Different device inputs carry different solutions, releasing them to the chamber of interest at specific times. Another approach is to have the reagents in droplet form, only merging with the specific cells at the exact instance needed. Through a compilation of the data from the parallel processes, diagnoses are made.",
