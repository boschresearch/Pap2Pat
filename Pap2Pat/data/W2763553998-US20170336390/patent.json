                        "Existing methods of interrogating a biological system can derive significant amounts of information. Examples of existing methods include methods for determining an organism's genome, exome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome.",
                        "The genome can be solved in order to determine an organism's genetic material, typically in the form of DNA (though RNA serves a similar purpose in a subset of organisms). The genome can include all of the genes stored within the genetic material. The exome is a part of the genome that is formed by exons.",
                        "The transcriptome refers to the level of expression of mRNA for a cell, a group of cells, or an entire organism. The transcriptome contains some information regarding the environment for a particular cell line, because the mRNA expression products can vary based on environmental conditions.",
                        "The proteome refers to the populations of proteins expressed in a cell, a group of cells, or an entire organism. The proteome also contains information regarding the environment for a particular cell line, because protein expression can vary based on environmental conditions.",
                        "The metabolome refers to the population of small-molecules present in a biological sample. The metabolome contains additional and different information regarding the environment for a particular cell line, because small-molecule generation and consumption can vary based on environmental conditions.",
                        "Beyond all of the above lies an area that has yet to be effectively or efficiently probed, namely the \u201cconformatiome\u201d, which refers to the conformational information for any or all of the biological molecules in a given biological sample. The conformatiome ideally provides conformational information regarding various biological molecules in their native and unaltered conformational state.",
                        "Current methods that claim to probe conformational structural information suffer from one or more of the following problems. First, some methods require crystallization of a sample (such as x-ray crystallography) or other manipulation that does not present the biological molecule in its native state. Second, some methods require the addition of non-native chemical species to a sample in order to provide species for tagging a sample. One example is fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP), which requires the addition of hydrogen peroxide to oxidize biological molecules. The addition of hydrogen peroxide may alter the conformational state of the biological molecules being studied. Third, some methods require immensely expensive equipment. For example, the aforementioned FPOP requires use of an excimer laser, which is an expensive instrument. Other methods, such as synchrotron-based hydroxyl radical footprinting, can involve use of multi-million dollar facilities such as a synchrotron.",
                        "A need exists for inexpensive systems and fast methods for studying the conformatiome, without the need to introduce the biological molecule(s) in question to foreign substances that might alter their structure."

This new process involves the generation of a plasma, which itself generates marker radicals (for example, hydroxyl radicals) that can oxidate various substituents on the biological molecule. The oxidation of biological molecules using hydroxyl radicals is generally known and the present disclosure represents an improvement in this process.",

The sample can be contacted by a fluid or enclosed within a confined space. The method can include: a) generating a plasma in the fluid within a distance of the sample or generating the plasma within the sample; and b) waiting a length of time. The plasma can have a nearest point to the sample at a distance of up to 1 cm, including but not limited to, up to 5 mm, up to 3 mm, up to 1 mm, up to 100 \u03bcm, up to 10 \u03bcm, or up to 1 \u03bcm. In certain aspects, the plasma can contact the sample. In certain aspects where the plasma is generated via an electrode, the plasma can be generated by an electrode that is positioned relative to the sample at a distance of up to 3 cm, including but not limited to, a distance of up to 1 cm, or a distance of up to 3 mm. A person having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that these distances can be scaled up or down by, for example, using a larger or smaller voltage or changing the frequency of plasma pulses.",
                                "The generating of step a) can thereby convert one or more of the plurality of marker radical precursors into one or more marker radicals. Examples of the marker radical include, but are not limited to, a hydroxyl radical (.OH), a hydrogen radical (H.), a nitrite or nitrogen dioxide radical (.NO2), a nitrate radical (.NO3), a peroxide radical (.OOH), other radicals known to those having ordinary skill in the art as being generated by a plasma interacting with a radical precursor, combinations thereof, and the like. Examples of the marker radical precursor include, but are not limited to, a hydroxyl radical precursor, such as water or hydrogen peroxide, a hydrogen radical precursors, such as hydrogen gas, a nitrite or nitrogen dioxide radical precursor, such as nitrite or nitrogen dioxide, a nitrate radical precursor, such as nitrate, a peroxide radical precursor, such as hydrogen peroxide, other precursors known to those having ordinary skill in the art to be converted into a radical by interacting with a plasma, combinations thereof, and the like. The length of time can be a length of time sufficient for the one or more marker radicals to interact with the biological molecule. This interaction can modify the biological molecule.",
                                "Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the generating a plasma in the fluid can involve converting marker radical precursors in the fluid into marker radicals, which then diffuse or are somehow otherwise transported into the sample. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the generating a plasma within the sample can involve converting marker radical precursors in the sample into marker radicals, which diffuse within the sample and then interact with the biological molecules. In certain aspects, the generating a plasma in the fluid or within the sample can include generating a plasma within both the fluid and the sample.",
                                "In certain aspects, the generating a plasma step can include generating a plasma from a plasma jet. The principle behind the plasma jet is described in greater detail below, but briefly, the plasma jet involves generating a plasma in a confined space and subsequently using gas flow to project the generated plasma toward a target (in this case, toward the sample).",

                                "In certain aspects, the plasma can be generated by a voltage of between 1 V and 1 MV, including but not limited to, a voltage of between 500 V and 100 kV, between 1 kV and 50 kV, or between 5 kV and 15 kV. As with the distances disclosed above, these voltages can be scaled up or down depending on the specific operational parameters.",
                                "In aspects utilizing a sequence of plasma pulses, the operational parameters in this paragraph can be utilized. The plasma pulses can have a pulse width in a range of between 1 ps and 1 ms, including but not limited to, a pulse with in a range of between 500 ps and 100 \u03bcs or between 1 ns and 10 \u03bcs. The sequence of plasma pulses can have a frequency in a range of between 1 Hz and 100 GHz, including but not limited to, a frequency in a range of between 10 Hz and 100 MHz, or between 1 kHz and 10 kHz. The sequence of plasma pulses can be generated for a total length of time in a range of between 1 ns and hours to days, including but not limited to, a total length of time in a range of between between 100 ns and 20 minutes, between 1 \u03bcs and 1 hour, between 1 ms and 30 minutes, between 1 s and 10 minutes, or between 30 s and 5 minutes. The aforementioned pulse width, frequency, and total length of time parameters for a sequence of plasma pulses can vary depending on the lifetime of the marker radicals being produced, the concentration of the target biological molecule, the size of the target biological molecule, the concentration of the marker radical precursor, the stability of the target biological molecule in the presence of varying concentrations of the marker radicals, and/or the extent of modification and/or destruction of the biological molecule that is desired.",
                                "In certain aspects, the plasma generating step can be configured to generate a concentration of marker radicals with the sample. The concentration of marker radicals is at its highest immediately following the plasma and decays over time as the marker radicals interact with biological molecules, interact with other components within the sample, and/or naturally decay over time due to recombination processes. In certain aspects, the generating a plasma step can be configured to provide a peak concentration of marker radicals in the sample that can be between 50 nM and 800 \u03bcM, including but not limited to, a peak concentration of marker radicals in the sample of between 500 nM and 800 nM, between 5 \u03bcM and 8 \u03bcM, or between 50 \u03bcm and 80 \u03bcm. In certain aspects, the generating a plasma step can be configured to provide an average concentration of marker radicals in the sample of between between 50 nM and 800 \u03bcM, including but not limited to, a peak concentration of marker radicals in the sample of between 500 nM and 800 nM, between 5 \u03bcM and 8 \u03bcM, or between 50 \u03bcm and 80 \u03bcm. In certain aspects, the average concentration can be a fraction or percentage of the values provided based on the \u201con\u201d time of the plasma, including but not limited to, 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% of the values provided. The average concentration can be measured for the length of time during which the plasma or the sequence of plasma pulses is generated plus a length of time of about 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 second, or 1 minute.",
                                "In certain aspects, the generating a plasma step can elevate a temperature of the sample by an amount less than an amount that would begin denaturation of the biological molecule or the plurality of biological molecules. If the plurality of biological molecules have different temperatures at which they denature, then the generating a plasma step can elevate the temperature of the sample by an amount less than an amount that would begin denaturation of the biological molecule having the lowest denaturation temperature. For purposes of this aspect of the disclosure, denaturation can refer to denaturation of quaternary, tertiary, or secondary structure.",
                                "In certain aspects, the generating a plasma step can elevate a temperature of the sample by less than 50\u00b0 C., including but not limited to, less than 5\u00b0 C., or less than 0.5\u00b0 C.

A low voltage a.c. source generated a variable frequency signal that was in the audio-frequency range. This signal was fed into a Trek amplifier (available commercially from Trek, Inc., Lockport, N.Y.) to produce a high-voltage signal at the same frequency up to 30 kHz. The output of the Trek amplifier was then fed to a nickel needle that was placed above the protein solution in a glass tube. The glass tube had a height of 0.75 inches and a diameter of 0.5 inches. The tube was sealed to a thin sheet of glass (0.0625 inches thick) that served as the dielectric barrier. A copper electrode was placed on the opposite side of the glass dielectric and was connected to the other (grounded) side of the signal generator. The plasma was formed in microsecond bursts whenever the voltage between the needle and the copper electrode exceeded a particular value that was dependent on the voltage magnitude and the frequency of the signal generator. The plasma was generated in the air above the protein solution and extended into the liquid itself.",

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, cytochrome C in a lightly buffered salt solution at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM was tested under the following conditions: no plasma exposure; 30 seconds of plasma exposure; and 2 minutes of plasma exposure. The experiments were conducted twice, independently, and analyzed using two different, complementary mass spectrometric techniques. The results have been condensed into FIG. 5, which illustrates that increasing plasma exposure time increased modification on a specific region of cytochrome C.

Referring to FIGS. 11 to 16, plots comparing the oxidation levels for undigested (top) and digested (bottom) bovine serum albumin are shown. FIGS. 11 and 12 are scaled to 100%, FIGS. 13 and 14 are scaled to 10%, and FIGS. 15 and 16 are scaled to 1.0%. While the plots that are scaled to 100% appear somewhat similar, the plots scaled to 10% and 1.0% show major differences between the undigested experiment and the digested experiment. Specifically, these data show evidence that the oxidation of various residues is limited by reduced solvent interaction when the protein has not been digested. On the other hand, digestion makes most residues solvent accessible and the resulting oxidation levels in the digested experiment illustrates that more residues are accessible. This example confirms that the methods described herein are useful for studying solvent accessibility and a digested protein can be utilized as a benchmark for comparison with an undigested protein."

It should be appreciated that many of the residues associated with the measured reduced oxidation (i.e., reduced oxidation when bound to EGF) are positioned at the interface of the EGFR homodimer, which implies that the areas of interaction in binding EGF and forming the activated homodimer (in addition to some residues that are remote from these areas of interaction) have reduced oxidation as a result of the structural modification of binding and dimerization.",
