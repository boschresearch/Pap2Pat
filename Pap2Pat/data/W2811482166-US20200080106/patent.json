                        "As described herein, exogenous circRNA was developed to extend the duration of protein expression from full-length RNA messages. First, a self-splicing intron was engineered to circularize efficiently a wide range of RNAs in vitro, coding for proteins such as Cas9, by rationally designing ubiquitous accessory sequences that aid in splicing. Functional protein was produced from these circRNAs in eukaryotic cells and translation incorporating different internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and internal polyadenosine tracts was maximized. Engineered circRNA purified by high performance liquid chromatography displayed exceptional protein production qualities in terms of both quantity of protein produced and stability of production. Provided herein are methods and compositions that facilitate the use of exogenous circRNA for robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells, rendering circRNA a promising alternative to linear mRNA.",
                        "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) endogenous to eukaryotic cells have drawn increasing interest due to their prevalence and range of potential biological functions (Barrett, S. P. & Salzman, J., \u201cCircular RNAs: analysis, expression and potential functions,\u201d Development, 143(11): 1838-1847 (2016)). Most circRNAs are generated through backsplicing and appear to fulfill noncoding roles (Barrett, S. P. & Salzman, J., \u201cCircular RNAs: analysis, expression and potential functions,\u201d Development, 143(11):1838-1847 (2016); Chen, L. & Yang, L., \u201cRegulation of circRNA biogenesis,\u201d RNA Biology, 12(4):381-388 (2015); Jeck, W. R. and Sharpless, N. E., \u201cDetecting and characterizing circular RNAs,\u201d Nat. Biotechnol., 32:453-461 (2014); Wang, Y. & Wang, Z., \u201cEfficient backsplicing produces translatable circular mRNAs,\u201d RNA, 21(2):172-179 (2014); Hansen, T. B. et al., \u201cNatural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges,\u201d Nature, 495(7441):384-388 (2013); Li, Z. et al., \u201cExon-intron circular RNAs regulate transcription in the nucleus,\u201d Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 22(3):256-264 (2015)). However, it has been suggested that some circRNAs endogenous to Drosophila may be translated into protein (Legnini, I. et al., \u201cCirc-ZNF609 Is a Circular RNA that Can Be Translated and Functions in Myogenesis,\u201d Molecular Cell, 66(1):22-37.e9 (2017); Pamudurti, N. R. et al., \u201cTranslation of CircRNAs,\u201d Molecular Cell, 66(1) (2017)).",
                        "In addition to having protein-coding potential, endogenous circRNAs lack the free ends necessary for exonuclease-mediated degradation, rendering them resistant to several mechanisms of RNA turnover and granting them extended lifespans as compared to their linear mRNA counterparts (Chen, L. & Yang, L., \u201cRegulation of circRNA biogenesis,\u201d RNA Biology, 12(4):381-388 (2015); Enuka, Y. et al., \u201cCircular RNAs are long-lived and display only minimal early alterations in response to a growth factor,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 44(3): 1370-1383 (2015)). For this reason, circularization may allow for the stabilization of mRNAs that generally suffer from short half lives and may therefore improve the overall efficacy of exogenous mRNA in a variety of applications (Kaczmarek, J. C. et al., \u201cAdvances in the delivery of RNA therapeutics: from concept to clinical reality,\u201d Genome Medicine, 9(1) (2017); Fink, M. et al., \u201cImproved translation efficiency of injected mRNA during early embryonic development,\u201d Developmental Dynamics, 235(12):3370-3378 (2006); Ferizi, M., et al., \u201cStability analysis of chemically modified mRNA using micropattern-based single-cell arrays,\u201d Lab Chip, 15(17):3561-3571 (2015)). However, the efficient circularization of long in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA, the purification of circRNA, and the adequate expression of protein from circRNA are significant obstacles that must be overcome before their protein-coding potential can be realized. As described herein, in one embodiment, an engineering approach is presented to generate exogenous circRNAs for potent and durable protein expression in cells, e.g., eukaryotic cells."

                                "There are three general strategies for exogenous RNA circularization: chemical methods using cyanogen bromide or a similar condensing agent, enzymatic methods using RNA or DNA ligases, and ribozymatic methods using self-splicing introns (Petkovic, S. & Muller, S., \u201cRNA circularization strategies in vivo and in vitro,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 43(4):2454-2465 (2015); Beadudry, D. & Perreault, J., \u201cAn efficient strategy for the synthesis of circular RNA molecules,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 23(15):3064-3066 (1995); Micura, R., \u201cCyclic Oligoribonucleotides (RNA) by Solid-Phase Synthesis, \u201cChemistry\u2014A European Journal, 5(7):2077-2082 (1999)). A ribozymatic method utilizing a permuted group I catalytic intron has been reported to be more applicable to long RNA circularization and requires only the addition of GTP and Mg2+ as cofactors (Petkovic, S. & Muller, S., \u201cRNA circularization strategies in vivo and in vitro,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 43(4):2454-2465 (2015)). This permuted intron-exon (PIE) splicing strategy consists of fused partial exons flanked by half-intron sequences (Puttaraju, M. & Been, M., \u201cGroup I permuted intron-exon (PIE) sequences self-splice to produce circular exons,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 20(20):5357-5364 (1992)). In vitro, these constructs undergo the double transesterification reactions characteristic of group I catalytic introns, but because the exons are already fused they are excised as covalently 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 linked circles (FIG. 1A) (Petkovic, S. & Muller, S., \u201cRNA circularization strategies in vivo and in vitro,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 43(4):2454-2465 (2015)). Using this strategy as a starting point for creating a protein coding circular RNA, a 1.1 kb sequence containing a full-length encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES, a Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) message, and two short regions corresponding to exon fragments (E1 and E2) of the PIE construct between the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 introns of the permuted group I catalytic intron in the thymidylate synthase (Td) gene of the T4 phage were inserted (FIG. 1A, Table 1) (Ford, E. & Ares, M., \u201cSynthesis of circular RNA in bacteria and yeast using RNA cyclase ribozymes derived from a group I intron of phage T4,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 91(8):3117-3121 (1994)). Precursor RNA was synthesized by run-off transcription and then heated in the presence of magnesium ions and GTP to promote circularization, essentially as described previously for the circularization of shorter RNAs (Ford, E. & Ares, M., \u201cSynthesis of circular RNA in bacteria and yeast using RNA cyclase ribozymes derived from a group I intron of phage T4,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 91(8):3117-3121 (1994)). However, splicing products were not obtained. It was speculated that long intervening regions between splice sites may reduce the ability of the splice sites to interact with one another and form a stable complex, thus reducing splicing efficiency. Indeed, the intervening region between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites of native group I introns is on average 300-500 nucleotides long, while the intervening region of the engineered RNA that we constructed was two to four-fold longer (Vicens, Q., et al., \u201cToward predicting self-splicing and protein-facilitated splicing of group I introns,\u201d RNA, 14(10):2013-2029 (2008)). Therefore, perfectly complementary \u2018homology arms\u2019 9 (weak) or 19 (strong) nucleotides in length were designed and placed at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the precursor RNA with the aim of bringing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites into proximity of one another (FIG. 1B, Table 1). Addition of these homology arms increased splicing efficiency from 0% to 16% for weak homology arms and to 48% for strong homology arms as assessed by disappearance of the precursor RNA band (FIG. 1C). To ensure that the major splicing product was circular, the splicing reaction was treated with RNase R (FIG. 1D). Sequencing across the putative splice junction of RNase R-treated splicing reactions revealed ligated exons, and digestion of the RNase R-treated splicing reaction with oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H produced a single band in contrast to two bands yielded by RNase H-digested linear precursor (FIG. 1D and FIG. 1E). These data show that circRNA is a major product of these splicing reactions and that agarose gel electrophoresis allows for simple and effective separation of circular splicing products from linear precursor molecules, nicked circles, splicing intermediates, and excised introns.",
                                "In order to further improve the efficiency of circRNA generation from the self-splicing precursor RNA, other factors that may influence successful circularization were considered. The 3\u2032 PIE splice site is proximal to the IRES, and because both sequences are highly structured it was hypothesized that sequences within the IRES may interfere with the folding of the splicing ribozyme, either proximally at the 3\u2032 splice site or distally at the 5\u2032 splice site through long-distance contacts. In order to allow these structures to fold independently, a series of spacers between the 3\u2032 PIE splice site and the IRES were designed and it was predicted would either permit or disrupt splicing (FIG. 1F, Table 1). Permissive spacers were designed to conserve secondary structures present within intron sequences that may be important for ribozyme activity, while the disruptive spacer was designed to disrupt sequences in both intron halves, especially the 5\u2032 half. The addition of spacer sequences predicted to permit splicing increased splicing efficiency from 46% to 87% (P1 and P2), while the addition of a disruptive spacer sequence completely abrogated splicing (FIG. 1G). This improved construct, containing both homology arms and rationally designed spacers, was able to circularize RNA approaching 5 kb in length (FIG. 4). The use of an alternative group I catalytic intron from the Anabaena pre-tRNA was also explored (Puttaraju, M. & Been, M., \u201cGroup I permuted intron-exon (PIE) sequences self-splice to produce circular exons,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 20(20):5357-5364 (1992)). The same optimization techniques used to increase the efficiency of the permuted T4 phage intron splicing reaction were applied. Interestingly, during our optimizations it was noted that switching from the T4 catalytic intron to the Anabaena catalytic intron may have resulted in the weakening of a short stretch of internal homology between the IRES and the 3\u2032 end of the coding region, which may have aided in the formation of an isolated \u2018splicing bubble\u2019 (FIG. 1H). Strengthening this internal homology further increased splicing efficiency from 84% to 95% using the permuted Anabaena catalytic intron (FIG. 1H and FIG. 1I, Table 1). The use of the Anabaena catalytic intron resulted in a 37% reduction in circRNA nicking compared to the T4 catalytic intron (FIG. 1I and FIG. 1J). Due to increased splicing efficiency and intact circRNA output, the engineered Anabaena PIE system proved to be overall superior to the engineered T4 PIE system (FIG. 1J).",
                                "Internal homology between exon 2 and the GLuc coding sequence rendered the optimized Anabaena PIE system incompatible with non-GLuc intervening regions. To adapt the circRNA construct for efficient circularization of a variety of long intervening RNA sequences, a pair of spacer sequences were de novo designed based on the understanding of the parameters that affect permuted catalytic group I intron splicing efficacy. These spacer sequences were engineered with three priorities: 1) to be inert with regards to the folding of proximal intron and IRES structures; 2) to sufficiently separate intron and IRES secondary structures; and 3) to contain a region of spacer-spacer complementarity to promote the formation of a \u2018splicing bubble\u2019 (FIG. 2A, Table 1). Homology arms at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the precursor molecule were also included. Between these sequences an EMCV IRES was inserted as well as coding regions for five different proteins, including Gaussia luciferase, Firefly luciferase, eGFP, human erythropoietin, and Cas9 endonuclease. Circularization of all five RNA sequences was achieved (FIG. 2B, Table 1); circularization efficiency matched that of the stepwise-designed construct (FIG. 1J) and was highly reproducible between inserts but was also dependent on size, with long RNAs less efficiently circularized (FIG. 5A). In addition, it was found that long circRNAs were more prone to nicking in the presence of magnesium ions, resulting in accumulation of nicked circRNA during and after in vitro transcription and RNase R digestion which reduced the overall yields and the purity of the RNase R-treated sample (FIG. 2B and FIG. 2C, FIG. 5A). RNase R did not fully digest resistant Anabaena introns (FIG. 2B, bottom bands) or circular concatenations (FIG. 2B, top bands).",
                                "It has been demonstrated that endogenous circRNA may produce small quantities of protein (Legnini, I. et al., \u201cCirc-ZNF609 Is a Circular RNA that Can Be Translated and Functions in Myogenesis,\u201d Molecular Cell, 66(1):22-37.e9 (2017)). As a means of assessing the ability of engineered circRNAs to produce protein, RNase R-digested splicing reactions of each construct was transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Transfection of Gaussia or Firefly luciferase circRNA resulted in robust production of functional protein as measured by luminescence (FIG. 2D and FIG. 2G). Likewise, human erythropoietin was detected in cell culture media from transfection of erythropoietin circRNA, and EGFP fluorescence was observed from transfection of EGFP circRNA (FIG. 2E and FIG. 2F). Co-transfection of Cas9 circRNA with sgRNA directed against GFP into HEK293 cells constitutively expressing GFP resulted in ablated fluorescence in up to 97% of cells in comparison to an sgRNA-only control (FIG. 2H and FIG. 2I). Because RNase R digestion of splicing reactions is not always complete and precursor RNA contains a functional IRES, a splice site deletion mutant of the GLuc construct was created to measure the potential contribution of impurities to protein expression. When transfected at equal weight quantities to RNase-R digested splicing reactions, this splice site deletion mutant produced a barely detectable level of protein (FIG. 5B and FIG. 5C).",
                                "To establish exogenous circRNA as a reliable alternative to existing linear mRNA technology it is desirable to maximize protein expression. Cap-independent translation mediated by an IRES can exhibit varying levels of efficiency depending on cell context and is generally considered less efficient than cap-dependent translation when included in bicistronic linear mRNA (Borman, A. M. et al., \u201cComparison of Picornaviral IRES-Driven Internal Initiation of Translation in Cultured Cells of Different Origins,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 25(5):925-932 (1997)). Similarly, the polyA tail stabilizes and improves translation initiation efficiency in linear mRNA through the actions of polyadenylate binding proteins (Imataka, H., \u201cA newly identified N-terminal amino acid sequence of human eIF4G binds poly(A)-binding protein and functions in poly(A)-dependent translation,\u201d The EMBO Journal, 17.24:7480-489 (1998); Kahvejian, A. et al., \u201cMammalian poly(A)-binding protein is a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, which acts via multiple mechanisms,\u201d Genes & Development, 19(1):104-113 (2005)). However, the efficiency of different IRES sequences and the inclusion of a polyA tract within the context of circRNA has not been investigated. The EMCV IRES was replaced with 5\u2032 UTR sequences from several viral transcripts that contain known or putative IRESs, as well as several other putative IRES sequences (Table 1, FIG. 6A) (Weingarten-Gabbay, S. et al., \u201cSystematic discovery of cap-independent translation sequences in human and viral genomes,\u201d Science, 351(6270) (2016)). It was found that the IRES from Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was 1.5-fold more effective than the commonly adopted EMCV IRES in HEK293 cells (FIG. 3A). Because secondary structures proximal to the IRES, including within the coding region that directly follows the IRES, have the potential to disrupt IRES folding and translation initiation, selected viral IRES sequences were tested in the context of Firefly luciferase. While the CVB3 IRES was still superior to all others, the efficacy of several other IRESs, most notably the Poliovirus IRES, was dramatically altered (FIG. 3B). The addition of an internal polyA sequence or a polyAC spacer control to IRES sequences was tested and showed the ability to drive protein production above background levels from engineered circRNA would alter protein expression. It was found that both sequences improved expression in all constructs, possibly due to greater unstructured separation between the beginning of the IRES sequence and the exon-exon splice junction, which is predicted to maintain stable structure (FIG. 3B, FIG. 6B). This greater degree of unstructured separation may reduce steric hindrance occluding initiation factor binding to IRES structures. In the case of EMCV and Poliovirus IRESs, polyA sequences improved expression beyond the improvement seen with an unstructured polyAC spacer. This may suggest that the association of polyadenylate binding proteins may enhance IRES efficiency. After selecting the most effective polyA or polyAC construct for each IRES, IRES efficacy in different cell types was explored, including human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), human lung carcinoma (A549), and immortalized mouse pancreatic beta cells (Min6). jIRES efficacy varied depending on type, but the CVB3 IRES was superior in all types tested (FIG. 3C, FIG. 6C and FIG. 6D).",
                                "Purity of circRNA preparations is another factor essential for maximizing protein production from circRNA and for avoiding innate cellular immune responses. It has been shown that removal of dsRNA by HPLC eliminates immune activation and improves translation of linear nucleoside-modified IVT mRNA (Kariko, K. et al., \u201cGenerating the optimal mRNA for therapy: HPLC purification eliminates immune activation and improves translation of nucleoside-modified, protein-encoding mRNA,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 39(21):e142-e142 (2011)). However, no scalable methods have been reported for purification of circRNA from byproducts of IVT and circularization reactions, which include dsRNA and triphosphate-RNA that may engage RNA sensors and induce a cellular immune response (Kariko, K. et al., \u201cGenerating the optimal mRNA for therapy: HPLC purification eliminates immune activation and improves translation of nucleoside-modified, protein-encoding mRNA,\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 39(21):e142-e142 (2011)). While the complete avoidance of nicked circRNA was untenable due to mild degradation during processing, substantially pure (90% circular, 10% nicked) circRNA was obtained using gel extraction for small quantities and size exclusion HPLC for larger quantities of splicing reaction starting material (FIG. 3D and FIG. 3E). In both cases, purification was followed with RNase R treatment to eliminate the majority of degraded RNA. When comparing the protein expression of gel extracted or HPLC purified circRNA to RNase-R digested splicing reactions, HPLC purification was found to be a superior method of purification that surpassed RNAse-R digestion alone (FIG. 3E and FIG. 3F).",
                                "It is unknown whether exogenous circRNA translation efficiency is comparable to that of linear mRNA, and whether circRNA protein production exhibits differences in stability. Using HPLC-purified engineered circRNA, the stability and efficacy of Gaussia luciferase-coding circRNA (CVB3-GLuc-pAC) was compared to equimolar quantities of a canonical unmodified 5\u2032 methylguanosine-capped and 3\u2032 polyA-tailed linear GLuc mRNA as well as a commercially available nucleoside modified linear GLuc mRNA (Trilink). Protein production assessed by luminescence 24 hours post-transfection revealed that circRNA produced 811.2% more protein than unmodified linear mRNA at this early time point in HEK293 cells (FIG. 3H). Interestingly, circRNA also produced 54.5% more protein than modified mRNA, demonstrating that nucleoside modifications are not necessary for robust protein production from circRNA. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (FIG. 3H). Luminescence data collected over six days showed that protein production from circRNA was extended relative to that from linear mRNA in HEK293 cells, with circRNA exhibiting a protein production half-life of 80 hours, while the half-lives of protein production from unmodified and modified linear mRNA were approximately 43 and 45 hours respectively (FIG. 3I). Due to increased expression or stability, circRNA also produced substantially more protein than both unmodified and modified linear mRNAs over its lifetime (FIG. 3J and FIG. 3K). In HeLa cells, circRNA exhibited a protein production half-life of 116 hours, while the half-lives of protein production from unmodified and modified linear mRNA were approximately 44 and 49 hours respectively (FIG. 3I). This again resulted in substantially more protein production from circRNA over its lifetime compared to both unmodified and modified linear mRNAs (FIG. 3J and FIG. 3K).",
                                "Obtaining stable protein production from exogenous mRNA has been a longstanding goal of mRNA biotechnology. The possibility of adapting circular RNA for this purpose has been stifled by low circRNA production efficiency, difficulty of purification, and weak protein expression. Indeed, these obstacles must be overcome before the stability of protein production from circRNA can be fully assessed. The modular permuted group 1 catalytic intron-based system using a vector that included homology arms and spacers as described herein permits the efficient circularization of a wide range of long RNAs. In addition, it was shown that optimized circRNA is capable of producing large quantities of protein and that it can be effectively purified by HPLC. Finally, it was shown that circRNA can produce greater quantities of protein for a longer duration than unmodified and modified linear RNA, providing evidence that circRNA holds potential as an alternative to mRNA for the stable expression of therapeutic proteins.",
                                "The results for FIG. 17 show that RNA circularization with a suboptimal construct can be promoted by increased temperature, but at the cost of increased degradation.",

Here, it is shown that unmodified exogenous circRNA is able to bypass cellular RNA sensors and thereby avoid provoking an immune response in RIG-I and toll-like receptor (TLR) competent cells and in mice. The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations is found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to evasion of TLR sensing, and provokes a cytokine response that is similar to that induced by uridine-modified linear mRNA. Additionally, it was found that uridine modification of circRNA disrupts internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation and does not have a significant effect on cytokine response. Finally, the data shows the first demonstration of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and the data shows that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs.",

Circular RNAs: analysis, expression and potential functions. Development 143, 1838-1847 (2016). Eukaryotic cells generate circRNAs through backsplicing, while the genomes of viral pathogens such as hepatitis D virus and plant viroids can also be circular (Chen, L.-L. & Yang, L. Regulation of circRNA biogenesis. RNA Biol. 12, 381-388 (2015); Jeck, W. R. & Sharpless, N. E. Detecting and characterizing circular RNAs. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 453-461 (2014); Wang, Y. & Wang, Z.

Nature 323, 558-560 (1986); Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017)). It has recently been proposed that cells have evolved a splicing-dependent mechanism for the discrimination of endogenous and exogenous circRNA, using RIG-1 as a cytoplasmic sensor of exogenous circRNA (Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017)). While circRNA does not contain the triphosphate motif canonically required for RIG-I activation, it has been suggested that RIG-I may transiently interact with circRNA devoid of host nuclear proteins, leading to a canonical RIG-I mediated antiviral response (Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017); Loo, Y. M. & Gale, M., Jr. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.\u2014PubMed\u2014NCBI. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616437. (Accessed: 7 May 2018)). However, the mechanism of RIG-I-mediated recognition of circRNA remains unclear. In addition to RIG-I, it is also possible that circRNA interacts with other RNA sensors such as the endosomal TLRs 3, 7 and 8, which have been shown to activate signaling in response to linear ssRNA and dsRNA motifs as well as RNA degradation products such as uridine and guanosine-uridine rich fragments (Tanji, H. et al. Toll-like receptor 8 senses degradation products of single-stranded RNA. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 22, 109-115 (2015); Zhang, Z. et al.

Toll-like receptor 3 recognizes incomplete stem structures in single-stranded viral RNA. Nat. Commun. 4, 1833 (2013)). To reduce an innate cellular immune response to exogenous RNA, nucleoside modifications such as pseudouridine (\u03c8), N1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03c8), and 5-methoxyuridine (5moU) have been developed for use in linear mRNA (Svitkin, Y. V. et al. N1-methyl-pseudouridine in mRNA enhances translation through eIF2\u03b1-dependent and independent mechanisms by increasing ribosome density.

F., Wang, C., Marcotrigiano, J. & Gehrke, L. RNAs Containing Modified Nucleotides Fail To Trigger RIG-I Conformational Changes for Innate Immune Signaling. MBio 7, (2016)). RNA modification with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to mediate cap-independent translation in endogenous linear and circRNAs (Meyer et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). The contribution of TLRs to circRNA immunogenicity, and the effects of nucleoside modifications on exogenous circRNA translation, stability, and immunogenicity, have yet to be reported.",

As described herein, the immunogenicity and translatability of exogenous circRNA in vitro and in vivo was investigated to determine the potential utility of circRNA for protein production applications. It was demonstrated herein that exogenous circRNA does not stimulate a cellular immune response in RIG-I and TLR competent cells. Additionally, it is shown that unlike linear mRNA, IRES-dependent circRNA does not benefit from modification with m1\u03c8 in terms of protein expression and immunogenicity or modification with m6A in terms of protein expression. It was found that circRNA is compatible with lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery and is effectively translated in vivo without provoking an RNA-mediated innate immune response, while protein expression from circRNA exhibits greater stability that that from uridine-modified linear mRNA in adipose tissue.",

                                "Using the optimized permuted intron-exon (PIE) splicing method previously reported, circRNA precursors were synthesized containing a coxsackievirus B3 internal ribosome entry site (CVB3 IRES), a Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) message, two designed spacer sequences, two short regions corresponding to exon fragments of the PIE construct, and the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 intron segments of the permuted Anabaena pre-tRNA group I intron by run-off transcription (FIG. 7A-B) (Wesselhoeft, R. A., Kowalski, P. S. & Anderson, D. G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells. Nat. Commun. 9, 2629 (2018); Puttaraju, M. & Been, M. Group I permuted intron-exon (PIE) sequences self-splice to produce circular exons. Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 5357-5364 (1992)). In the presence of GTP and Mg2+, these precursor RNA molecules undergo the double transesterification reactions characteristic of group I catalytic introns, but because the exons are already fused, the region between the two intron segments is excised as a covalently 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 linked circle (FIG. 7A) (Puttaraju, M. & Been, M. Group I permuted intron-exon (PIE) sequences self-splice to produce circular exons. Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 5357-5364 (1992)). To confirm that circular products were obtained, the splicing reaction was treated with RNase R, a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 RNA exonuclease, and observed enrichment of the putative circRNA band (FIG. 7C) (Suzuki, H. et al. Characterization of RNase R-digested cellular RNA source that consists of lariat and circular RNAs from pre-mRNA splicing. Nucleic Acids Res. 34, e63-e63 (2006)). Subsequent purification of the RNase R-treated splicing reaction by HPLC and then digestion with oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H produced a single major band in contrast to two major bands yielded by RNase H-digested linear precursor RNA that contains all of the same sequence elements as the circRNA precursor with the exception of the splice site nucleotides (FIG. 7C, \u0394S), confirming circularity. Splicing reactions containing circRNA demonstrated improved protein production and expression stability of protein production in comparison to polyadenylated and phosphatase-treated linear precursor after transfection into 293 cells (FIG. 7. G-I).",
                                "To probe the immunogenicity of circRNA, two cell lines (human embryonic kidney, 293; human lung carcinoma, A549) were selected that had been observed to elicit differential cell viability and GLuc expression stability responses upon transfection of unpurified circRNA splicing reactions (FIGS. 7 E and F). After the circularization protocol, these splicing reactions are expected to contain circRNA, excised triphosphorylated introns, linear and circular concatenations, and degradation products of both linear RNA and circRNA, some of which is triphosphorylated. While the splicing reaction proceeds nearly to completion under the circularization conditions used herein, some triphosphorylated linear precursor RNA is also present. Several steps were then applied of purification to the unpurified splicing reactions and confirmed circRNA enrichment by gel electrophoresis: RNase R to enrich circRNA, HPLC to remove non-circular components, and phosphatase to remove residual triphosphates (FIG. 7D). To determine the extent of the innate cellular immune response to transfected RNA, the release of a wide range of cytokines and chemokines into the culture medium was monitored, as well as the protein expression stability from circRNA and cell viability.",
                                "It was found that RNase R digestion of splicing reactions was insufficient to ablate cytokine release in A549 cells in comparison to untransfected controls (FIG. 7F, FIG. 8G). The addition of HPLC purification was furthermore insufficient to ablate cytokine release, although we did note a significant reduction in IL-6 and a significant increase in IFN-\u03b11 compared to the unpurified splicing reaction, suggesting that combined RNase R and HPLC may have depleted some immunogenic RNA species while enriching others (FIG. 7F). The addition of HPLC purification was furthermore insufficient to ablate cytokine release, although a reduction in IL-6 compared to the unpurified splicing reaction (FIG. 7F) was noted. Interestingly, the addition of a phosphatase treatment after HPLC purification and before RNase R digestion dramatically reduced the expression of all upregulated cytokines that we assessed in A549 cells, with secreted MCP1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b11, TNF-\u03b1, and IP-10 falling to undetectable or untransfected-baseline levels (FIG. 7F). Substantial cytokine release in 293 cells was not observed, consistent with the observation that the 3-day protein expression stability phenotype of these cells is relatively unaffected by the degree of circRNA purity and previous reports indicating that 293 cells do not express several key RNA sensors (FIG. 7E, FIG. 8G) (Hornung, V. et al. Quantitative expression of toll-like receptor 1-10 mRNA in cellular subsets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sensitivity to CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. J. Immunol. 168, 4531-4537 (2002)). In contrast, increased circRNA purity improved GLuc expression stability in transfected A549 cells, with completely purified circRNA demonstrating a stability phenotype similar to that of transfected 293 cells (FIGS. 7E and F). Likewise, a trend of increased circRNA purity improved A549 cell viability 3 days post-transfection while 293 cell viabilities remained largely unaffected, consistent with a lack of inflammatory signaling in 293 cells and diminishing inflammatory signaling in A549 cells with increasing circRNA purity (FIGS. 7E and F). Together, these results demonstrate that circRNA purity strongly affects its immunogenic potential, and that fully purified circRNA is significantly less immunogenic than unpurified or incompletely purified splicing reactions. The stability of protein production from circRNA is also dependent on circRNA purity and the sensitivity of transfected cell types to contaminating RNA species. A time course experiment monitoring RIG-I, IFN-\u03b21, IL-6 and RANTES transcript induction within the first 8 hours after transfection of A549 cells with splicing reactions or fully purified circRNA did not reveal a transient response to circRNA (Figure S2F). Purified circRNA similarly failed to induce pro-inflammatory transcripts in RAW264.7 murine macrophages (Figure S2G). To generalize these findings to another synthetic circRNA construct, we tested the induction of pro-inflammatory transcripts in response to transfection of A549 cells with purified circRNA containing an EMCV IRES and EGFP coding region, and again failed to observe substantial induction (Figure S2H). These data demonstrate that non-circular components of the splicing reaction are responsible for the immunogenicity observed in previous studies and that circRNA is not a natural ligand for RIG-I.",

                                "To explore the source of immunogenicity in circRNA splicing reactions, each component of the splicing reaction was purified by HPLC and assessed cytokine release and cell viability upon transfection of A549 cells (FIGS. 8A and B). Because there was difficulty obtaining suitably pure linear precursor RNA from the splicing reaction, precursor RNA in the form of the splice site deletion mutant (\u0394S) (FIG. 8B, bottom right) was separately synthesized and purified. Additionally, the circRNA peak was split into two fractions to control for nicked RNA peak overlap (FIG. 8B). Robust IL-6, RANTES, and IP-10 release was observed in response to most species present within the splicing reaction as well as precursor RNA (FIG. 8C, FIG. 9G). Early circRNA fractions elicited cytokine responses comparable to other non-circRNA fractions, indicating that even relatively small quantities of linear RNA contaminants are able to induce a substantial cellular immune response in A549 cells. Late circRNA fractions elicited no cytokine response in excess of that from untransfected controls. Consistent with cytokine release observations, A549 cell viability 36 hours post transfection was significantly greater for late circRNA fractions compared to all other fractions (FIG. 8D).",
                                "Because it has been previously reported that circRNA may induce RIG-I transcription in a self-regulatory feedback loop, RIG-I and IFN-\u03b21 transcript induction was analyzed upon transfection of A549 cells with late circRNA HPLC fractions (Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017)). A significantly weaker induction of both RIG-I and IFN-\u03b21 transcripts for late circRNA fractions was observed in comparison with precursor RNA and unpurified splicing reactions (FIG. 8E). Furthermore, it was found that RNase R treatment of splicing reactions alone was not sufficient to ablate this effect (FIG. 8F), while contamination of purified circRNA with very small quantities of the RIG-I ligand 3p-hpRNA induced substantial RIG-I transcription (FIG. 9I). In HeLa cells, transfection of RNase R-digested splicing reactions, but not purified circRNA, induced RIG-I and IFN-\u03b21, although it was found that HeLa cells to be less sensitive than A549 cells to contaminating RNA species (FIG. 9L). These data suggest that non-circular components of the splicing reaction are responsible for the immunogenicity observed in previous studies and that circRNA is not an endogenous ligand for RIG-I.",
                                "Nucleoside Modification of circRNA is Disruptive",
                                "Nucleoside modifications such as 5-methylcytidine (m5C), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and pseudouridine (\u03c8) have been reported to decrease the immunogenicity of linear mRNA in vitro and in some contexts in vivo by preventing ribonucleotides from interacting with cellular RNA sensors such as the endosomal TLRs 3, 7, and 8 and RIG-I (Karik\u00f3, K., Buckstein, M., Ni, H. & Weissman, D. Suppression of RNA recognition by Toll-like receptors: the impact of nucleoside modification and the evolutionary origin of RNA. Immunity 23, 165-175 (2005); Durbin, A. F., Wang, C., Marcotrigiano, J. & Gehrke, L. RNAs Containing Modified Nucleotides Fail To Trigger RIG-I Conformational Changes for Innate Immune Signaling. MBio 7, (2016)). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been reported to mediate internal ribosome entry and translation on linear RNAs and separately on endogenous circRNAs (Meyer et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). The effects of these modifications on the utility of mRNA in vivo may be variable however, as yu-mRNA delivered to the liver does not reduce immunogenicity or improve protein production (Kauffman, K. J. et al. Efficacy and immunogenicity of unmodified and pseudouridine-modified mRNA delivered systemically with lipid nanoparticles in vivo. Biomaterials 109, 78-87 (2016)). Recently, it was reported that incorporation of m1\u03c8 diminishes mRNA immunogenicity and improves protein expression to a greater degree than incorporation of \u03c8 (Svitkin, Y. V. et al. Ni-methyl-pseudouridine in mRNA enhances translation through eIF2\u03b1-dependent and independent mechanisms by increasing ribosome density. Nucleic Acids Res. 45, 6023-6036 (2017) and Andries, O. et al. N(1)-methylpseudouridine-incorporated mRNA outperforms pseudouridine-incorporated mRNA by providing enhanced protein expression and reduced immunogenicity in mammalian cell lines and mice. J. Control. Release 217, 337-344 (2015)). The effects of nucleoside modifications on circRNA translation efficiency and immunogenicity have not been tested. Because of previous difficulties with circRNA purification, the immunogenicity of purified circRNA relative to that of unmodified linear mRNA has also not been assessed. Therefore, it was sought to evaluate the GLuc protein expression stability and cytokine release profile of purified unmodified and m1\u03c8-modified circRNA in comparison to unmodified and m1\u03c8-modified linear mRNA in A549 and 293 cells (FIG. 9A).",
                                "Initial attempts to circularize m1\u03c8-circRNA using the PIE method were unsuccessful, as complete replacement of uridine with m1\u03c8 in PIE construct precursors abolished ribozyme activity while partial replacement dramatically reduced splicing efficiency (FIG. 9B). An alternative method of circRNA preparation using T4 RNA ligase I and splint oligonucleotides designed to bring the ends of the precursor RNA into proximity for ligation (FIG. 10G) (Sonja Petkovic, S. M. RNA circularization strategies in vivo and in vitro. Nucleic Acids Res. 43, 2454 (2015)). Using optimized splint oligonucleotides and annealing conditions, 40% circularization efficiency of the 1.5 kb precursor RNA was obtained (FIGS. 10H and I). Complete replacement of uridine with m1\u03c8 did not impede circularization using this method and fully modified circular products were obtained (FIG. 9C).",
                                "Upon transfection of 293 and A549 cells with m1\u03c8-circRNA, no protein expression was observed, and thus the stability of protein expression from modified circRNA was not determined (FIG. 9D). Unmodified circRNA displayed enhanced protein expression stability in HEK293 and A549 cells compared to both unmodified and modified linear mRNA (FIGS. 9E and F). Interestingly, it was found that unmodified linear mRNA provoked a greater cytokine response than unmodified circRNA in immunoresponsive A549 cells despite capping, phosphatase treatment, and HPLC purification to remove RIG-I ligands. In contrast, both m1\u03c8-circRNA and m1\u03c8-mRNA did not significantly alter cytokine release profiles (FIG. 9F, FIG. 11E). A549 cell viability was diminished upon transfection of unmodified linear mRNA, but not unmodified circRNA or either m1\u03c8-RNAs (FIG. 9F). Consistent with data from FIGS. 7A-F, significant differences in 293 cytokine release at 24 hours post-transfection and cell viability at 3 days post-transfection was not detected (FIG. 9E, FIG. 11E). These experiments indicate that circRNA is less immunogenic than capped and polyadenylated linear mRNA and that nucleoside modification of circRNA is unnecessary for protection against innate immune sensors.",
                                "CircRNA Evades Detection by Toll-Like Receptors",
                                "Because capped and polyadenylated linear mRNA was able to trigger cytokine secretion while circRNA did not, the ability of different RNAs to activate TLRs in reporter cell lines was investigated. TLRs 3, 7, and 8 are known to detect RNA in endosomes and initiate an inflammatory cascade (Takumi Kawasaki, T. K. Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways. Front. Immunol. 5, (2014)). TLR3 binds to dsRNA and stem structures in viral ssRNA, while TLR7 and human TLR8 bind to ssRNA and nucleoside degradation products (guanosine for TLR7 and uridine for TLR8), with both ligands necessary for TLR activation (Tanji, H. et al. Toll-like receptor 8 senses degradation products of single-stranded RNA. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 22, 109-115 (2015); Zhang, Z. et al. Structural Analysis Reveals that Toll-like Receptor 7 Is a Dual Receptor for Guanosine and Single-Stranded RNA. Immunity 45, 737-748 (2016); Bell, J. K., Askins, J., Hall, P. R., Davies, D. R. & Segal, D. M. The dsRNA binding site of human Toll-like receptor 3. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 8792-8797 (2006); and Tatematsu, M., Nishikawa, F., Seya, T. & Matsumoto, M. Toll-like receptor 3 recognizes incomplete stem structures in single-stranded viral RNA. Nat. Commun. 4, 1833 (2013)). To control for structural and sequence differences between linear and circular RNAs, a linearized version of the circRNA was constructed. This construct contained all of the components of the spliced circRNA, and was created by deleting the intron and homology arm sequences (linearized RNA, FIG. 10A, FIG. 12G). All linearized RNAs were additionally treated with phosphatase (in the case of capped RNAs, after capping) and purified by HPLC. While a response to linearized or circular RNA in TLR7 reporter cells was not found, both TLR3 and TLR8 reporter cells were activated by capped linearized RNA, polyadenylated linearized RNA, the nicked circRNA fraction, and the early circRNA fraction (FIG. 10B). Interestingly, the late circRNA fraction did not provoke a TLR-mediated response in any cell line, similarly to m1\u03c8-mRNA (FIG. 10B). However, the addition of uridine, but not cytidine, to the media of TLR8 reporter cells transfected with circRNA partially reverted this effect and resulted in SEAP secretion, indicating that trans-addition of one of the two RNA degradation signals needed for TLR8 activation can compensate for the lack of circRNA detection by TLR8 (FIG. 10C, FIG. 12H).",
                                "Next, purified circRNA was linearized using two methods: treatment of circRNA with heat in the presence of magnesium ions, and DNA oligonucleotide-guided RNase H digestion (FIG. 10D). Both methods yielded a majority of full-length linear RNA with small amounts of intact circRNA, although heat treatment resulted in a greater proportion of lower molecular weight linear RNA degradation products (FIG. 10E). Transfection of circRNA degraded by both heat and RNase H prompted SEAP secretion in TLR8 reporter cells (FIG. 4F). No activation was observed in TLR3 and TLR7 reporter cells for degraded or intact conditions despite activation of TLR3 by in vitro transcribed linearized RNA (FIG. 4F, FIG. 12I). These results indicate that circRNA is able to avoid detection by TLRs, and that TLR8 evasion is a result of circular conformation.",

                                "Translation and immunogenicity of unmodified and m1\u03c8-modified human erythropoietin (hEpo) linear mRNAs and circRNAs was first examined, with linear mRNAs identical to those depicted in FIG. 9A with the exception of the coding region (FIG. 13, FIG. 14A). Equimolar transfection of m1\u03c8-mRNA and unmodified circRNA resulted in robust protein expression in 293 cells (FIG. 14B). hEpo linear mRNA and circRNA displayed similar relative protein expression patterns and cell viabilities in comparison to GLuc linear mRNA and circRNA upon equal weight transfection of 293 and A549 cells (FIGS. 14C and D). In mice, hEpo was detected in serum after injection of hEpo circRNA or linear mRNA into visceral adipose (FIGS. 11A and D). hEpo detected after injection of unmodified circRNA decayed more slowly than that from unmodified or m1\u03c8-mRNA and was still present 42 hours post injection (FIG. 11B). A rapid decline in serum hEpo upon injection of unpurified circRNA splicing reactions or unmodified linear mRNA (FIG. 11B) was observed. Injection of unpurified splicing reactions furthermore produced a cytokine response detectable in serum that was not observe for the other RNAs, including purified circRNA (FIG. 11C, FIG. 15).",
                                "CircRNA is Compatible with Lipid Nanoparticles",
                                "Lipid nanoparticles have shown significant potential for use as delivery vehicles for therapeutic RNAs, including the delivery of mRNA to tissues (Oberli, M. A. et al. Lipid Nanoparticle Assisted mRNA Delivery for Potent Cancer Immunotherapy. Nano Lett. 17, 1326-1335 (2017); Yanez Arteta, M. et al. Successful reprogramming of cellular protein production through mRNA delivered by functionalized lipid nanoparticles. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 115, E3351-E3360 (2018); and Kaczmarek, J. C., Kowalski, P. S. & Anderson, D. G. Advances in the delivery of RNA therapeutics: from concept to clinical reality. Genome Med. 9, 60 (2017)). To assess the efficacy of lipid nanoparticles for circRNA delivery in vivo, purified circRNA was formulated into nanoparticles with the ionizable lipidoid cKK-E12 (Dong, Y. et al. Lipopeptide nanoparticles for potent and selective siRNA delivery in rodents and nonhuman primates. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111, 3955-3960 (2014); and Kauffman, K. J. et al. Optimization of Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations for mRNA Delivery in Vivo with Fractional Factorial and Definitive Screening Designs. Nano Lett. 15, 7300-7306 (2015)). These particles formed uniform multilamellar structures with an average size, polydispersity index, and encapsulation efficiency similar to that of particles containing commercially available control linear mRNA modified with 5-methoxyuridine (5moU, FIG. 12A, Table 2). Purified hEpo circRNA encapsulated in LNPs displayed robust expression upon addition to 293 cells in comparison to 5moU-mRNA (FIG. 12B, left). This commercially available mRNA performed similarly to the m1\u03c8-mRNA that was used previously relative to circRNA (FIG. 14C). Protein expression stability from LNP-RNA in 293 cells was similar to that from RNA delivered by transfection reagent with the exception of a slight delay in decay for both 5moU-mRNA and circRNA (FIG. 12B, right). Encapsulation in LNPs did not alter RIG-I/IFN-\u03b21 induction or TLR activation in vitro, with unmodified circRNA failing to activate immune sensors in a manner similar to 5moU-mRNA (FIGS. 12C and D).",
                                "In mice, LNP-RNA was locally injected into visceral adipose tissue (FIG. 16B). Serum hEPo expression from circRNA was lower but comparable with that from 5moU-mRNA 6 hours after injection of LNP-RNAs into visceral adipose or intravenous delivery to liver (FIG. 12E, FIG. 16E). Serum hEpo detected after adipose injection of unmodified LNP-circRNA decayed more slowly than that from LNP-5moU-mRNA, with a delay in expression decay present in serum similar to that noted in vitro (FIG. 12F); however, serum hEpo detected after intravenous injection of LNP-circRNA decayed at the same rate as that from LNP-5moU-mRNA (FIG. 16E). An increase in serum cytokines was not observed, or local RIG-I, TNF-\u03b1, or IL-6 transcript induction after injection of LNP-5moU-mRNA or LNP-circRNA (FIGS. 16C and D)."

                        "In this work it was demonstrated that exogenous circRNA evades RNA sensors and that expression is extended relative to linear mRNA following injection into mouse adipose tissue. While previous studies examining circRNA immunogenicity have proposed that exogenous circRNA provokes a strong innate cellular immune response mediated by RIG-I, due to an absence of associated host splicing factors (Chen et al. 2017), it was found in this study that circRNA does not activate several known cellular RNA sensors including TLRs and RIG-I (Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017)). These discordant results are likely to be the result of impurities in circRNA preparations. Previous studies have used circRNA purified by RNase R (Chen, Y. G. et al. Sensing Self and Foreign Circular RNAs by Intron Identity. Mol. Cell 67, 228-238.e5 (2017)). This study found that treatment with RNase R is not sufficient to obtain pure circRNA and enriches multiple resistant RNA species, which include circRNA and linear RNAs with structured 3\u2032 ends. Furthermore, even small quantities of contaminating linear RNA, some of which may harbor triphosphates and may be present after HPLC purification, are sufficient to provoke robust cellular immune responses (FIG. 9C). HPLC purification of circRNA presents unique difficulties, as nicked circRNA and intact circRNA are equal in molecular weight and their respective peaks partly overlap. Degradation products of triphosphorylated precursor RNA will also separate within the circRNA peak, and therefore gentle circRNA preparation is required. Phosphatase treatment, minimizing heat exposure in the presence of divalent cations, and stringent HPLC peak selection can reduce these hazards. Using the purification protocol described here, it was found that circRNA does not elicit substantial innate immune responses from TLR and RIG-I competent cells, in contrast to other components of the splicing reaction, or from mouse adipose tissue, despite the absence of circRNA-associated host splicing factors. Using the purification protocol described here, it was found that circRNA does not elicit substantial innate immune responses from TLR and RIG-I competent cells, in contrast to other components of the splicing reaction, or from mouse adipose tissue. In addition, protein production from purified circRNA is significantly more stable than that from unpurified circRNA and transfection of purified circRNA results in greatly improved cell viability (FIG. 7F, FIG. 8D), both of which are indicators of an antiviral response resulting from non-circular contaminants (Loo, Y. M. & Gale, M., Jr. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.\u2014PubMed\u2014NCBI. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616437. (Accessed: 7 May 2018)). Nucleoside modifications, especially uridine modifications, have been reported to reduce linear mRNA immunogenicity by preventing detection by RNA sensors, which may be important for RNA function in some tissue types (Karik\u00f3, K., Buckstein, M., Ni, H. & Weissman, D. Suppression of RNA recognition by Toll-like receptors: the impact of nucleoside modification and the evolutionary origin of RNA. Immunity 23, 165-175 (2005); Durbin, A. F., Wang, C., Marcotrigiano, J. & Gehrke, L. RNAs Containing Modified Nucleotides Fail To Trigger RIG-I Conformational Changes for Innate Immune Signaling. MBio 7, (2016)). With the constructs described here, enhanced protein expression stability from m1\u03c8-mRNA compared to unmodified mRNA in vitro and in adipose tissue was observed (FIGS. 9E, 11B). This may be a secondary outcome of immune evasion or an unrelated primary effect of modification. Modification of circRNA precursor molecules with m1\u03c8 interfered with splicing in the PIE constructs and translation in the enzymatically circularized RNAs, suggesting that m1\u03c8 significantly changes the folding of ribozyme and IRES structures.",
                        "Modification of RNA with m6A has been shown to promote cap-independent translation of endogenous linear and circular RNAs in living cells and exogenous linear RNAs in cell lysates (Meyer et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). We found that partial replacement of adenosine with m6A was not sufficient to drive translation from exogenous intact or linearized circRNA in living cells, consistent with previous reports indicating the involvement of nuclear RNA binding proteins in assisting m6A-dependent translation (FIGS. 9F,G) (Lin et al. 2016).",
                        "Unlike linear mRNA, circRNA relies heavily on folded RNA structures, including the permuted group I intron and IRES, for splicing and translation. Modification of circRNA precursor molecules with m1\u03c8 and m6A interfered with splicing in the PIE constructs and translation in the enzymatically circularized RNAs, suggesting that modifications significantly change the folding of these structural elements (FIGS. 9B,D,F,G).",
                        "Incorporation of \u03c8 has been shown to enhance base-stacking interactions, which may lead to structural alterations; however, it is possible that other nucleoside modifications may be more compatible with ribozyme and IRES structures and allow for the study of modified circRNA translation during stability (Davis, D. R. Stabilization of RNA stacking by pseudouridine. Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 5020 (1995)). While it is known that modified linear mRNA is able to avoid detection by TLRs, it was surprising to discover that unmodified circRNA exhibits the same property. Recently, the ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 have been reported as degradation products of RNA including short stretches of ssRNA and nucleosides (Tanji, H. et al. Toll-like receptor 8 senses degradation products of single-stranded RNA. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 22, 109-115 (2015); Zhang, Z. et al. Structural Analysis Reveals that Toll-like Receptor 7 Is a Dual Receptor for Guanosine and Single-Stranded RNA. Immunity 45, 737-748 (2016)). These degradation products are presumably produced by nucleases in the endosome shortly after the RNA is internalized (Roers, A., Hiller, B. & Hornung, V. Recognition of Endogenous Nucleic Acids by the Innate Immune System. Immunity 44, 739-754 (2016)). The contiguous structure of circRNA may confer it with resistance to endosomal nucleases, resulting in evasion of these detectors. In this case, endosomal nucleases would be expected to be composed primarily of exonucleases, as the presence of endonucleases would be expected to lead to circRNA degradation. Consistent with this postulation, the addition of one of the two cooperative TLR8 ligands, uridine, to the media of TLR8 reporter cells was able to partially abrogate the immunoevasive properties of circRNA, suggesting that a lack of degradation products and therefore nuclease resistance may indeed be responsible for TLR8 evasion by circRNA. However, no degradation product has yet to be defined as a ligand for TLR3, which circRNA also appears to evade in the context of TLR3-overexpressing 293 cells despite containing the same dsRNA motifs as the TLR3-activating linearized circRNA. It may be possible that RNA degradation products bind to TLR3 at the dimerization interface in a similar manner to TLR8 (Roers, A., Hiller, B. & Hornung, V. Recognition of Endogenous Nucleic Acids by the Innate Immune System. Immunity 44, 739-754 (2016)). Differences in TLR3 activation by linearized circRNA was also observed, with in vitro transcribed linearized circRNA eliciting a TLR3-mediated response while linearized circRNA produced by degrading purified circRNA did not (FIGS. 10B and F). It is possible that degradation of circRNA by either heat or RNase H disrupts dsRNA structures required for robust TLR3 activation.",
                        "Intra-adipose injection of circRNA complexed with transfection reagent or within LNPs yielded hEpo expression that was more stable than that from m1\u03c8-mRNA or 5moU-mRNA (FIG. 11B and FIG. 12F). However, although hEpo production from circRNA was observed to be close to twofold higher than that from equimolar transfection of m1\u03c8-mRNA or 5moU-mRNA in 293 cells at 24 hours, hEpo expression from circRNA in vivo was relatively diminished. Several factors may have led to this result. The CVB3 IRES was originally selected for use in circRNA based on its ability to drive translation in human cell lines (Wesselhoeft, R. A., Kowalski, P. S. & Anderson, D. G. Engineering circular RNA for potent and stable translation in eukaryotic cells. Nat. Commun. 9, 2629 (2018)). Mouse adipose or liver tissue may therefore not be the ideal cell type for CVB3 IRES-mediated translation. IRES sequences must also compete for translation initiation factors with endogenous transcripts bearing m7G caps. Accordingly, circRNA using viral IRES sequences to initiate translation could be more effective in cells with higher initiation factor density relative to transcript density. A comprehensive characterization of the ability of other IRES sequences to drive translation from circRNA in diverse tissues is needed.",
                        "Protein expression stability from circRNA delivered intravenously by LNP to liver was not enhanced compared to that from 5moU-mRNA, although the relative magnitude of expression from circRNA at 6 hours was comparable to that obtained from adipose tissue (FIG. 12E and FIG. 16E). This result highlights tissue specific stability that may be dependent on several factors, including general RNA turnover rate or endonuclease activity, sequence specific translation inhibition or degradation, and the presence or absence of RNA stabilizing proteins. Assessment and alteration of miRNA binding sites within circRNA or depletion of sequence-specific degradation motifs may further enhance circRNA stability and expression in select tissues.",
                        "An increase in serum cytokines was detected in mice injected with unpurified splicing reactions, but such a response in mice injected with unmodified mRNA, m1\u03c8-mRNA/5moU-mRNA, or circRNA was not detected. Consistent with in vitro results, a rapid decrease in hEpo expression upon injection of unmodified mRNA and unpurified splicing reactions was observed, while serum hEpo after injection of m1\u03c8-mRNA/5moU-mRNA and circRNA remained relatively stable, indicating that m1\u03c8-mRNA/5moU-mRNA and circRNA did not provoke a substantial immune response that would lead to RNA degradation in vivo. Formulation of circRNA into LNPs did not alter immune sensor interactions, and analysis of serum cytokines and local pro-inflammatory transcript levels after LNP-RNA injections did not reveal an immune response against LNP-delivered circRNA.",
                        "It is believed that the enhanced expression stability of circRNA in some tissues and the ability of circRNA to avoid immune sensors without the need for nucleoside modifications demonstrates the potential of circRNA as a vector for the expression of therapeutic proteins.",

                        "RNA Design, Synthesis, and Purification",
                        "Linear mRNA or circRNA precursors were synthesized by runoff in-vitro transcription from a linearized plasmid DNA template using a T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs (NEB)) with the complete replacement of uridine with N1-methylpseudouridine (Trilink Biotechnologies) for modified linear or circular RNA. After in vitro transcription, reactions were treated with DNase I (NEB) for 15 minutes. After DNase treatment, RNA was column purified using a MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Ambion). RNA was then heated to 70\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes and immediately placed on ice for 2 minutes, after which linear RNA was capped using mRNA cap-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (NEB) and Vaccinia capping enzyme (NEB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyadenosine tails were added to capped linear transcripts using E. coli PolyA Polymerase (NEB) according to manufacturer's instructions, and fully processed mRNA was column purified. For circRNA, GTP was added to a final concentration of 2 mM along with a buffer including magnesium (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5; NEB), and then reactions were heated at 55\u00b0 C. for 8 minutes. RNA was then column purified. In some cases, circRNA was digested with RNase R: 20 g of RNA was diluted in water (86 uL final volume) and then heated at 70\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes and cooled on ice for 2 minutes. 20 U RNase R and 10 uL of 10\u00d7 RNase R buffer (Applied Biological Materials) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes; an additional 10 U RNase R was added halfway through the reaction. RNase R-digested RNA was column purified. In some cases, RNA was treated with a phosphatase (CIP, NEB): 20 ug of RNA was diluted, heated and cooled as described above and then Cutsmart buffer (NEB) was added to a final concentration of 1\u00d7 along with 20 U of CIP. The reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. Phosphatase-treated RNA was column purified.

RNA was then separated on precast 2% E-gel EX agarose gels (Invitrogen) on the E-gel iBase (Invitrogen) using the E-gel EX 1-2% program; ssRNA Ladder (NEB) was used as a standard. Bands were visualized using blue light transillumination and quantified using ImageJ. For high-performance liquid chromatography, 30 g of RNA was heated at 65\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes and then placed on ice for 2 minutes. RNA was run through a 4.6\u00d7300 mm size-exclusion column with particle size of 5 m and pore size of 2000 \u212b (Sepax Technologies; part number: 215980P-4630) on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC (Agilent). RNA was run in RNase-free TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH:6) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/minute. RNA was detected by UV absorbance at 260 nm, but was collected without UV detection. Resulting RNA fractions were precipitated with 5M ammonium acetate, resuspended in water, and then in some cases subjected to further enzymatic treatment as described above. 5moU-modified Firefly Luciferase and hEpo mRNA was obtained from Trilink Biotechnologies.",
