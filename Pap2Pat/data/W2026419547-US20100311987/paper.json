    "abstract": "We report here the isolation and characterization of a new compound Ailanthus excelsa chloroform extract-1 (AECHL-1) (C(29)H(36)O(10); molecular weight 543.8) from the root bark of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. The compound possesses anti-cancer activity against a variety of cancer cell lines of different origin.AECHL-1 treatment for 12 to 48 hr inhibited cell proliferation and induced death in B16F10, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC3 cells with minimum growth inhibition in normal HEK 293. The antitumor effect of AECHL-1 was comparable with that of the conventional antitumor drugs paclitaxel and cisplatin. AECHL-1-induced growth inhibition was associated with S/G(2)-M arrests in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC3 cells and a G(1) arrest in B16F10 cells. We observed microtubule disruption in MCF-7 cells treated with AECHL-1 in vitro. Compared with control, subcutaneous injection of AECHL-1 to the sites of tumor of mouse melanoma B16F10 implanted in C57BL/6 mice and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in athymic nude mice resulted in significant decrease in tumor volume. In B16F10 tumors, AECHL-1 at 50 microg/mouse/day dose for 15 days resulted in increased expression of tumor suppressor proteins P53/p21, reduction in the expression of the oncogene c-Myc, and downregulation of cyclin D1 and cdk4. Additionally, AECHL-1 treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in B16F10 tumors, which seems to exhibit p53-dependent growth inhibitory responses.The present data demonstrate the activity of a triterpenoid AECHL-1 which possess a broad spectrum of activity against cancer cells. We propose here that AECHL-1 is a futuristic anti-cancer drug whose therapeutic potential needs to be widely explored for chemotherapy against cancer.",

                "According to the World Health Organization based on morbidity, mortality, economic burden, and emotional hardship, cancer may be considered the most onerous health problem afflicting people worldwide [1]. Currently, over 22.4 million people in the world are suffering from cancer. Approximately 10.1 million new cases are diagnosed with cancer annually, and more than 6.2 million die of the disease in the year 2000 [2]. This represents an increase of around 19% in incidence and 18% in mortality since 1990. An important aim of cancer research is to find therapeutic compounds having high specificity for cancerous cells/tumor and fewer side effects than the presently used cytostatic/cytotoxic agents.",
                "Numerous plant-derived compounds used in cancer chemotherapy include vinblastine, vincristine, camptothecin derivatives, etoposide derived from epipodophyllotoxin, and paclitaxel (taxol\u00ae) [3]. However most of these compounds exhibit cell toxicity and can induce genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects in non-tumor cells, and some of them failed in earlier clinical studies [4], [5]. Another most widely used metal-based drug at present against selected types of cancers is cisplatin [6], but use of cisplatin in curative therapy was associated with some serious clinical problems, such as severe normal tissue toxicity and resistance to the treatment [7]. These side effects limit their use as chemotherapeutic agents despite their high efficacy in treating target malignant cells. Consequently, new therapies and treatment strategies for this disease are necessary for treating patients with this disease. Therefore, the search for alternative drugs that are both effective in the treatment of cancers as well as non-toxic to normal tissue is an important research line [8].",
                "Terpenoids are used extensively for their aromatic qualities. They play a role in traditional herbal remedies and are under investigation for antibacterial, antineoplastic, and other pharmaceutical functions. Natural triterpenoids, such as oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, are compounds with anti-tumorigenic and anti-inflammatory properties [9]. Synthetic triterpenoid derivatives such as 2-Cyano-3, 13 dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) [10] and its derivative 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl] imidazole (CDDO-Im) [11] also have anti-tumor activity. Root bark of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb (Tree of Heaven), a tree belonging to family Simaroubaceae is widely used in Ayurveda as evidenced by phytotherapy [12]. Other species from this family are well known for their anti-cancer activities [13]. Chemical constituents of A. excelsa include some triterpenes and alkaloids [14]. In the present study we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity of a novel triterpenoid, AECHL-1 isolated from the root bark of the plant and found to be highly effective in cancer cells of different lineage."

Paclitaxel treatment showed an increase in the population of MCF-7 cells in G2/M phase (29.30% to 72.55%) with a decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 phase (48.30% to 4.62%) suggesting a growth arrest in G2/M phase (Table 1). These results suggest that inhibition of cell cycle progression could be one of the molecular events associated with selective anti-cancer efficacy of AECHL-1 in cancer cells."

Our preliminary studies showed that, of the various doses of AECHL-1 (0.5 to 5 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneal in C57BL/6 mice, the maximum tolerated dose was a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg that showed no obvious sign of toxicity when observed for one month. On this basis, the dose that was chosen was 50 and 100 \u00b5g/kg/day (a dose that was 10\u201320% of this maximum tolerated dose). On day 18 significant increase in tumor volume in control group (p<0.001) and a regression in tumor volume was evident in mice treated with 50 \u00b5g AECHL-1 (44.303\u00b15.20 % (p<0.001)) and with 100 \u00b5g AECHL-1 (51.014\u00b11.27% (p<0.001)).

However, AECHL-1 (50 \u00b5g) vs. AECHL-1 (100 \u00b5g) was found to be non Significant (P>0.05). On day 24 control, AECHL-1 (50 \u00b5g) and AECHL-1 (100 \u00b5g) treated mice showed further increase in tumor volume (p<0.001) but mice treated with cisplatin showed reduction in tumor volume (p<0.001). However, although cisplatin showed further reduction in tumor volume, the damage caused to other organs was more than that in the AECHL-1 (50 & 100 \u00b5g) treated group in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6A and 6B).",

As shown in Figure 4E, AECHL-1 at 50 \u00b5g/mouse/day administered to B16F10-implanted tumors in C57BL/6 mice resulted in an increase in the expression of wild-type p53 protein and then decreased at a higher concentration (100 \u00b5g/mouse/day). The level of the p53 was greater in the AECHL-1-treated group than in the cisplatin-treated group, indicating that the antitumor action of AECHL-1 was different from cisplatin. Since phosphorylation at the Ser-15 residue of p53 is critical for p53-dependent activation of cell cycle regulatory proteins for G1 arrest, we determined the phosphorylation status of p53 and cyclin D1 and cdk4. AECHL-1 treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 residue in tumors at 50 \u00b5g/mouse/day with a concomitant increase in the level of p21 and decreased at 100 \u00b5g/mouse/day. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mouse/day AECHL-1 caused a significant reduction in the cycle-regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and cdk4. Treatment with 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mouse/day AECHL-1 also caused a significant reduction in the oncogene c-Myc thus indicating that inhibition of the cell cycle may be responsible for antitumor effects of AECHL-1 (Figure 7)."

                "In the present study, we report a new anti-cancer compound AECHL-1, isolated from root bark of the plant Ailanthus excelsa. AECHL-1 was characterized by UV, IR, NMR and mass spectroscopy and the purity was conformed by HPLC. It is a triterpenoid with high polarity and a molecular weight 453.8 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The tumor-suppressor gene p53 plays a vital role in the development of various types of cancers. It is estimated that 50% of all cancers develop due to mutations in p53 [21]\u2013[23]. Therefore, we first tested the effect of AECHL-1 cytotoxicity and proliferation in four different cancerous cell lines with different tissue origin that contain either wild-type or mutant p53, as well as p53 null. B16F10 and MCF-7 cells contain wild type p53, MDA-MB-231 cells contain mutant p53 and PC3 cells are p53 null. Cisplatin, a highly DNA damaging agent and paclitaxel, a tubulin based anti-mitotic agent were used as positive controls.",

Cytotoxicity was also observed in the other cancer cells at 48 hr to a varying degree with a minimum growth inhibition of a normal human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293 (Figure 3B). The degree of cytotoxicity was MCF-7>B16F10>PC-3>MDA-MB-231>HEK-293 (Figure 3B) and inhibition of cell proliferation was MCF-7>B16F10>MDA-MB-231>PC-3 (Figure 3C).",
                "Compared with paclitaxel and cisplatin, AECHL-1 showed greater potency in MCF-7 (Figure 3D), B16F10 and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation inhibition at 24 and 48 hr (data not shown). These results indicate that in MCF-7, B16F10 and MDA-MB-231 cell line AECHL-1 is more effective in inhibition of cell proliferation than cisplatin or paclitaxel. However, in PC-3 cells, paclitaxel is more effective than cisplatin and AECHL-1.",
                "In B16F10 cells, AECHL-1 was found to significantly induce cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, while in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells it showed arrest in S-G2/M phase in MCF-7 cells (Table 1).",
                "The cell cycle arrest in AECHL-1 treated MCF-7 cells was followed by concentration dependent apoptosis, but the percentage of cell death was dependent on the types of cell lines. Compared to B16F10 and MDA-MB-231 cells, AECHL-1 was highly effective in MCF-7 cells at both high and low concentrations (Figure 4).",
                "Therapeutic interference with the mitotic spindle apparatus is a widely used rationale for the treatment of tumors. The microtubule network required for mitosis and cell proliferation has been shown to be disrupted by the diterpenoid paclitaxel [24]. It has also been shown that microtubule disruption elevates p53 protein levels [25]. Our immunofluorescence staining of tubulin showed that similar to paclitaxel, AECHL-1 inhibited microtubule assembly (Figure 5).",
                "Our in vitro results demonstrate that AECHL-1 can act as a new class of microtubule damaging agent arresting cell cycle progression at mitotic phase and inducing apoptosis. AECHL-1 was tested in vivo in C57BL/6 mice allograft with melanoma, B16F10 and nude mice xenograft with human breast cancer cells, MCF-7. Injections of AECHL-1 to the tumor sites were found to inhibit tumor growth in both models. In case of B16F10 melanoma model, a daily dose of 50 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g showed a significant antitumor effect, leading to regression of established tumors (Figure 6A and 6B) however; cisplatin was more effective than AECHL-1 but AECHL-1 showed less toxicity to kidney and heart while cisplatin showed greater damage to kidney, heart, liver and spleen (Figure 8.1). In the MCF-7 breast cancer model, a daily dose of 5 and 10 \u00b5g showed a significant antitumor effect, leading to regression of established tumors (Figure 6C and 6D).",
                "In order to understand the major in vivo pathways through which AECHL-1 may induce tumor suppression, we studied the expression of the tumor suppressor, cell cycle regulatory proteins and oncogene in B16F10 melanoma. Our in vitro cell cycle analysis on B16F10 had showed a strong G1 arrest as a result of AECHL-1 treatment. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation in vivo in B16F10 tumor showed that both 50 \u00b5g of AECHL-1 and cisplatin up regulated the expression of p53 (Figure 7). However, AECHL-1 induced hyper phosphorylation of p53 at ser-15. Phosphorylation of p53 at ser15 help in strongly binding p53 to DNA for the up regulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins that helps in suppression of the growth of tumor [26]. Cisplatin also up regulated p53, but phosphorylation at ser-15 was not observed (Figure 7). This may be due to the fact that cisplatin suppress the growth of tumor cells by DNA damage and apoptosis [27]. The observation that ser-15 phosphorylation is required for p21 induction prompted us to investigate its role in G1 arrest [26], [28]. We found an increase in the expression of p21 in the AECHL-1 treated tumors. p21 forms a complex with CDK2/CDK4/CDK6 and inhibit the CDK-cyclin kinase activity phase [28], [29] and arrest the cells in G1 phase. c-Myc is an oncogene that is up regulated in cancer cells and help in the tumor growth [30]. We observed that treatment of AECHL-1 resulted in a marked decrease in c-Myc, CDK-4 and cyclin D1 levels that is known to arrest the cell in G1 [31]. Decreases level of c-Myc is known to be involved in the down regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 [32] (Figure 7). This also decreases the kinase activity and arrest the cell in G1 phase.",
                "In conclusion, our data clearly show that AECHL-1 is less toxic, more selective, and more effective in the treatment of cancer in comparison to plant derived anti-cancer compound paclitaxel and metal-based compound cisplatin. It is efficacious in inhibiting the proliferation of a broad range of cancer cells as well as solid tumors. The novel compound AECHL-1 is found to interact directly with tubulin, arrest the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis of tumor cells. The antitumor effect of AECHL-1 was comparable with or even superior to the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs tested. The positive outcomes of such an in vitro and in vivo study could form a strong basis for the development of AECHL-1 as a novel agent for human cancer prevention and/or intervention."
