    "date": "2022-06-17",
    "abstract": "Purpose Although both relaxation and diffusion imaging are sensitive to tissue microstructure, studies have reported limited sensitivity and robustness of using relaxation or conventional diffusion alone to characterize tissue microstructure. Recently, it has been shown that tensor\u2010valued diffusion encoding and joint relaxation\u2010diffusion quantification enable more reliable quantification of compartment\u2010specific microstructural properties. However, scan times to acquire such data can be prohibitive. Here, we aim to simultaneously quantify relaxation and diffusion using MR fingerprinting (MRF) and b\u2010tensor encoding in a clinically feasible time. Methods We developed multidimensional MRF scans (mdMRF) with linear and spherical b\u2010tensor encoding (LTE and STE) to simultaneously quantify T1, T2, and ADC maps from a single scan. The image quality, accuracy, and scan efficiency were compared between the mdMRF using LTE and STE. Moreover, we investigated the robustness of different sequence designs to signal errors and their impact on the maps. Results T1 and T2 maps derived from the mdMRF scans have consistently high image quality, while ADC maps are sensitive to different sequence designs. Notably, the fast imaging steady state precession (FISP)\u2010based mdMRF scan with peripheral pulse gating provides the best ADC maps that are free of image distortion and shading artifacts. Conclusion We demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying T1, T2, and ADC maps simultaneously from a single mdMRF scan in around 24 s/slice. The map quality and quantitative values are consistent with the reference scans.",

                "At typical MRI resolution, each voxel contains multiple microenvironments with different tissue properties. This challenges detection and diagnosis of many diseases that are characterized by cellular\u2010level heterogeneity, such as epilepsy and brain tumors. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in characterizing tissues and lesions with multiple image contrasts to improve the sensitivity to tissue microstructure. Two main categories in quantitative MRI for multi\u2010parametric imaging and microstructure imaging are MR relaxometry, such as T1, T2, and T2* mapping, 1  and diffusion MRI. 2 ,  3",
                "To improve the sensitivity and specificity of characterizing complex tissues/lesions and translate the techniques into clinical practice, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed. First, although both relaxation and diffusion are sensitive to the microenvironment and have been commonly used in disease characterization, 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11  relaxation and diffusion MRI data are typically acquired separately and analyzed using separate models, which could lead to registration errors and estimation bias. Specifically, for multi\u2010compartment estimation when multiple tissues with different relaxation rates and diffusion times are present, multidimensional encoding and signal models that account for relaxation\u2010diffusion correlations would allow decoupling of each compartment that cannot be achieved with relaxation or diffusion only methods. Studies showed that using relaxation only made the estimation of multi\u2010compartment models sensitive to noise, 12  and using diffusion only to disentangle intra\u2010 and extra\u2010axonal compartment properties in brain white matter is degenerate and ill\u2010posed. 13  Second, although diffusion has a direct relation to tissue microstructure, studies have highlighted limitations of microstructure imaging from conventional diffusion encoding (Stejskal\u2010Tanner) 14  alone, as it does not retain information of the microscopic heterogeneity. 8 ,  15 ,  16  For example, studies showed that using the Stejskal\u2010Tanner experiment (or linear tensor encoding [LTE]) alone cannot disentangle the effects of multiple isotropic diffusivities, orientation dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy from each other. 17 ,  18  Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish a tissue with randomly oriented fiber\u2010like structures from isotropic tissue with varying cell densities, which might reflect different tumor types. 18",
                "Because these first two limitations lead to degeneracy in multi\u2010compartment estimation, adding information from additional dimensions has become the main strategy to improve the robustness and accuracy of microstructure estimation. For example, the combination of diffusion and relaxometry has been used in non\u2010imaging nuclear MR experiments to disentangle different compartments. 19 ,  20  These approaches have been extended to imaging. For example, incorporating T2 into biophysical models of diffusion improved the specificity of multi\u2010compartment tissue models, 21  and estimated intra\u2010 and extra\u2010axonal tissue properties. 22  To address the sensitivity limitation of Stejskal\u2010Tanner encoding, double diffusion encoding (DDE) 23  and isotropic diffusion encoding 24 ,  25  were proposed for probing local pore geometry and for rapid DWI. 26 ,  27  Westin et al. proposed a general framework to describe diffusion encoding for arbitrary gradient waveforms. 28  In this framework, the b\u2010value and encoding direction were replaced by the \u201cb\u2010tensor,\u201d which also describes the shape of the diffusion encoding, extending the b\u2010tensor shape from Stejskal and Tanner's linear b\u2010tensor encoding (LTE) to other shapes like planar and spherical b\u2010tensor encoding (PTE and STE). 16 ,  18 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35  By using multiple b\u2010tensor shapes, one can differentiate between, for example, heterogeneity of isotropic compartments and microscopic anisotropy.",
                "As more information or encoding dimensions are needed for multi\u2010parameter quantification, scan time is the third limitation that prevents microstructure imaging from clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, Hutter et al. developed an acquisition technique called ZEBRA for a joint sampling of T1\u2010T2*\u2010diffusion 36  with interleaved inversion times and diffusion encodings from multiple scans, and Ma et al. developed an efficient T1, T2, and ADC mapping method using Multi\u2010tasking. 37  However, none of these studies have explored the scan efficiency of tensor\u2010valued diffusion encoding for joint relaxation\u2010diffusion imaging. Specifically, because the STE gradients are isotropic diffusion\u2010sensitizing gradients that can directly provide the trace of the diffusion tensors from a single scan, the scan with STE gradients could be potentially more efficient in quantifying ADC as compared to the scan with linear tensor encoding (LTE, or Stejskal\u2010Tanner) that requires directional averaging. Although studies in the 90s 24 ,  25  have already identified this benefit and proposed optimization methods for STE, the performance and application were still limited by hardware constraints.",
                "In this study, we developed a multidimensional MR fingerprinting scan (mdMRF) to address the three limitations mentioned above, that is to simultaneously quantify multiple tissue properties that are sensitive to tissue microstructure in a clinically feasible time. MR fingerprinting (MRF) is a fast quantitative imaging technique that is able to quantify multiple tissue property maps simultaneously from a single scan. 38  Specifically, MRF provides a highly flexible framework to encode MR signals with multiple acquisition parameters, such as variable flip angles, TI, TE, and TR times, diffusion b\u2010values and encoding directions. The signals that are sensitive to multiple tissue properties, such as relaxation and diffusion, are then varied without reaching a steady state. This encoding strategy has shown improved robustness and accuracy in tissue property quantification 39 ,  40 ,  41 ,  42  and multi\u2010compartment separation. 43 ,  44  Moreover, dictionary\u2010based MRF mapping has shown high tolerance to measurement noise and artifacts (aliasing and motion), allowing accurate and reproducible tissue property estimation even under an acceleration rate of up to \u223c400 as compared to the Nyquist rate. 38 ,  39 ,  40 ,  42 ,  45 ,  46  Both features will contribute to a clinically feasible solution for multidimensional imaging. Because different b\u2010tensors require somewhat different sequence designs, such as the minimum TE and number of diffusion encoding directions, for the measurement of ADC (or mean diffusivity), we additionally studied the scan efficiency, scan time, and image quality of using two different b\u2010tensor encodings in the mdMRF scans, including linear tensor encoding and spherical tensor encoding using optimized gradient waveform designs, 47 ,  48  for joint relaxation and diffusion quantification. Here, we demonstrate that mdMRF enables simultaneous quantification of T1, T2, and ADC maps in 24\u2009s per slice."

                        "Figure\u00a01 demonstrates the sequence structure of an mdMRF scan. The sequence is composed of multiple acquisition segments, each starting with a preparation module such as T1 inversion pulses, T2 preparations using MLEV (Malcolm\u2010Levitt) composite pulses, 49  and diffusion preparations with adiabatic excitation and refocusing pulses (BIR\u20104) and diffusion encoding gradients. Various TIs, TEs, b\u2010values, and diffusion encoding directions can be implemented in the preparation modules in order to encode the signals with multidimensional parameters. In this study, we implemented mdMRF with linear tensor encoding (mdMRF\u2010LTE) and spherical tensor encoding (mdMRF\u2010STE) separately. The diffusion encoding gradient waveforms are shown in Figure\u00a01B. The STE gradient waveform was designed using the NOW toolbox with concomitant field compensation, 47 ,  48 ,  50  which showed a 22% reduction of the TE time to achieve the same b\u2010value as compared to the conventional design. After each preparation module, a series of MRF images was acquired, followed by a waiting time to allow the spins to partially recover before the next acquisition segment. One set of preparation module, MRF readouts, and waiting time make up an acquisition segment shown in Figure\u00a01A. In each MRF readout, a single\u2010shot uniform\u2010density spiral trajectory was used with an undersampling factor of 48 and a readout duration of 3\u00a0ms. The spiral was rotated with a golden angle from one image to the next. Figure\u00a01C shows one example of a flip angle pattern used in each segment where 96 images were acquired. Figure\u00a01D shows an example of the waiting time pattern added at the end of each segment, where 28 segments were acquired from a single mdMRF scan. The waiting time was varied ranging from 100\u2009ms to 500\u2009ms. The variation was added to increase the variation of the segment duration and to avoid acquiring the images at a constant timing in pulsation cycles. A 100\u2009ms lower bound was added to avoid high specific absorption rate (SAR) due to continuous preparations and excitations and a 500\u2009ms higher bound was chosen to balance the scan time and the variations. For the mdMRF\u2010LTE scans, the acquisition segments with diffusion encoding were repeated multiple times with three diffusion directions ([1 1\u20131], [1\u20131 1], [\u22121 1 1]). Because STE performs isotropic diffusion encoding, 51  no rotation was applied to the diffusion encoding gradients in the mdMRF\u2010STE scans. Two example sequence patterns, including flip angles, the order and values of all the preparation modules and timings, are listed in Supporting Information Table\u00a0S1, which is available online.",
                        "Diffusion\u2010weighted scans can be highly sensitive to phase errors, such as those resulting from eddy current and physiological motions (cardiac pulsation). In this study, three MRF readout designs (gray section of Figure\u00a01A) were implemented to investigate the robustness of the resulting maps to measurement errors: (1) conventional FISP\u2010based MRF readouts, 52  (2) FLASH\u2010based MRF readouts with RF and gradient spoiling, as well as phase stabilizers that are commonly used in the diffusion\u2010prepared sequences. 37 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 ,  56  The phase stabilizers (4pi dephasing) were implemented before the \u221290 degrees tip\u2010up pulse of each diffusion preparation module and after each RF pulse of the MRF readout within diffusion acquisition segments. The purpose of the phase stabilizer was to convert the eddy current\u2010induced phase errors to the signal phase while keeping the signal magnitude unaffected, and (3) FISP and FLASH\u2010based MRF readouts with peripheral pulsation gating. Specifically, the first MRF readout of each acquisition segment was triggered by the real\u2010time pulsation signal using a peripheral pulse oximeter placed on the forefinger of the participant's right hand with a 250\u2009ms delay time. The purpose was to avoid the dephasing of signals and phase incoherence between MRF readouts and between acquisition segments due to physiological motion. The waiting time after each segment was set to 0 in all the scans with peripheral pulsation gating, because the pulsation gating introduces subject\u2010dependent and varying waiting times between segments."

The ADC maps from the gated scans show improved image quality without any \u201cshading artifacts.\u201d Compared to the FISP based designs, the FLASH\u2010based results show higher noise enhancement in the ADC maps (FLASH_gating_1 and FLASH_gating_2) by visual inspection. As a result, the FISP\u2010based mdMRF scan allows shorter scan time (24\u2009s) with comparable image quality.",

There are high intensity ADC values outside of the diffusion phantom tubes, probably due to B0 shimming or vibration from the distilled water. Figures\u00a06A\u2013C compare the quantitative T1, T2, and ADC values derived from mdMRF and from the reference scans. All the results are in good agreement with the reference values, with all R2 above 0.97. T1 from both mdMRF\u2010LTE and mdMRF\u2010STE scans show the highest correlation with the reference scans with R2\u00a0=\u00a00.99.

                "In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously quantifying relaxation and diffusion from a single MR fingerprinting (mdMRF) scan with tensor\u2010valued diffusion encodings. Because there is a large number of degrees of freedom in designing MRF scans, various sequence designs were implemented and the performances were compared. Overall, the mdMRF scans (mdMRF\u2010LTE and mdMRF\u2010STE) with the FISP\u2010based MRF readouts and pulsation gating provide the best map quality within a scan time of only 24\u201337\u2009s per slice. The mdMRF\u2010LTE scans showed lower noise as compared to the maps from the mdMRF\u2010STE scans. The T1 and T2 maps and the ADC map are perfectly coregistered because they are all from the same scan. In addition, there is negligible image distortion due to field inhomogeneity presented in the ADC maps of all the mdMRF scans.",
                "The scan accuracy and efficiency were compared between the mdMRF\u2010LTE and \u2010STE scans, and between mdMRF scans and the reference scans. For the phantom scans, there was no significant difference in the scan efficiency between mdMRF\u2010LTE and \u2010STE scans. The scan efficiency for T1 was over two times higher than that for T2 and ADC, demonstrating varied tissue sensitivity from the current mdMRF scan implementation. There was also no significant difference in the quantitative values between mdMRF\u2010LTE and \u2010STE scans, except for a 3.3% relative difference in T2 values in the phantom experiment. Between mdMRF scans and the reference scans, there was an average bias of 10% identified in the phantom scans, and up to 20% bias of T2 in the in vivo scan. Because the conventional MRF scans were used as the reference (due to efficient scan time for in vivo scans), the difference could be due to different signal modeling, as the conventional MRF only considered T1 and T2 in the dictionary simulation, while the mdMRF scan simulated T1, T2, and ADC effects. The slice profile effects could also be different, because the flip angle range was between 10 to 60 degrees in conventional MRF and between 10 to 20 degrees in mdMRF scans. The scans with higher flip angles may suffer more from slice profile imperfections. Slice profile and B1 corrections will be implemented in the future to correct for the flip angle\u2010dependent variations. 60  In Figure\u00a07, some differences in the ADC maps derived from LTE and STE can be identified. The difference could be due to eddy current induced errors in the STE scan, as the STE gradients have overall higher gradient amplitude and slew rate as compared to the LTE gradients. An eddy current compensated STE waveform will be implemented in the future to address this potential error source. 61  The difference could also be due to the underlying sensitivity of these two encoding methods to the microstructure heterogeneity. For sufficiently low b\u2010values, the mean diffusivity (MD) measured by LTE and STE is equivalent. However, as the b\u2010value increases, the MD estimation is influenced by higher order terms; the LTE variance is affected by the isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis, whereas STE is affected only by the isotropic kurtosis. Thus, in the presence of a positive anisotropic kurtosis (diffusion anisotropy), the MD estimated by LTE is lower than that estimated by STE.",
                "The diffusion encodings were implemented in the mdMRF based on the diffusion\u2010prepared SSFP (DP\u2010SSFP) 62 ,  63 ,  64  where the diffusion encoded signals are tipped up to the longitudinal direction by a \u221290\u00b0 pulse and excited by a SSFP acquisition train. A well\u2010known issue of DP\u2010SSFP is that the signals acquired in steady state can be more sensitive to phase errors induced by eddy\u2010currents or motion than other diffusion weighted (DW) acquisitions where image readout follows immediately after the diffusion encoding gradients. First, the phase errors due to eddy current of the diffusion gradients or motion will be stored in the longitudinal direction after the \u221290\u2010degree pulse and affect the signal magnitude shot\u2010to\u2010shot after being tipped down by the excitation pulses in the SSFP acquisition. Such magnitude inconsistency has been reported to cause signal voids and shading artifacts in the resulting images and ADC maps. 56 ,  65  Second, if the signal is not fully spoiled in the SSFP acquisition, the phase error may be accumulated in higher order echoes along the long echo train, making it hard to model, identify and correct. Although MRF allows implementation of variable excitations and timings in order to make the signals more incoherent than those from conventional DP\u2010SSFP, the effects of measurement errors due to eddy current and motions still need to be investigated.",
                "Various approaches have been proposed to address the phase errors for diffusion prepared and multi\u2010shot diffusion weighted acquisitions. First, stabilizer (or crusher) gradients were introduced to the diffusion prepared sequences to spoil the phase before the tip up pulse in the diffusion preparation and restore it after each excitation in the SSFP acquisition, in order to maintain the correct signal magnitude. 37 ,  54 ,  66  One can then directly use the magnitude\u2010only analysis or correct the phase errors separately. The main drawback of this approach is the signal loss due to repeated crusher gradients in each acquisition window, resulting in low SNR of the entire diffusion weighted signal. 37  Second, artifacts due to pulsatile motion in the diffusion images and the corresponding estimation bias in DTI have been reported. 67 ,  68 ,  69  The pulsation induced artifacts are spatially varying and are more severe in inferior and medial areas of the brain due to higher velocities. 69  Although cardiac or pulsation gating reduced such artifacts, such methods suffered from prolonged scan time as compared to non\u2010gated scans. Third, phase corrections using either navigator\u2010based 70 ,  71 ,  72 ,  73  or navigator\u2010free 74 ,  75 ,  76  approaches have been commonly used in multi\u2010shot diffusion scans. In the navigator\u2010based approaches, the phase errors were estimated using either low\u2010resolution images acquired separately or from the same scan and corrected in the reconstruction. The navigator free approaches use parallel imaging reconstruction or sparsity constraints to estimate temporal varying phase of each shot and build the phase component into the reconstruction to correct for it.",
                "In this study, we implemented multiple variants of mdMRF and investigated the robustness of each approach. First, there are diffusion specific errors in the resulting maps as shown in Figure\u00a04. The image quality of T1 and T2 maps are consistently good no matter which readout designs or scan time was used, indicating good robustness of mdMRF scans for T1 and T2 quantification. On the other hand, the ADC maps are sensitive to different readout designs. In particular, the ADC maps derived from the non\u2010gated FISP\u2010based and FLASH\u2010based mdMRF scans exhibited image shading (or intensity imbalance), which has been reported previously and has been associated with diffusion sensitivity to phase errors. 53  Second, as shown in Figure\u00a02, the phase stabilizer approach (FLASH\u2010based mdMRF) suffered from low signal intensity as compared to FISP\u2010based MRF design. When comparing the in vivo maps in Figure\u00a04, the ADC maps derived from the FLASH\u2010based mdMRF scans also showed high noise enhancement than those from the FISP\u2010based mdMRF scans by visual inspection. The direct consequence is that the FLASH\u2010based mdMRF scans require longer scan time to achieve good map quality. Third, the phase stabilizer approach was not able to fully address the measurement errors, shown in Figure\u00a04g, while adding pulsation gating was able to restore the image quality from both FISP\u2010based and FLASH\u2010based mdMRF scans.",
                "The main concerns of the pulsation gated scans are the scan efficiency and the extension to volumetric acquisitions. Nevertheless, the waiting time was added in between acquisition segments to allow the spins to recover, so there is no significant increase of scan time between the non\u2010gated and gated scans. The waiting times between segments were varied, based on the empirical design in non\u2010gated scans and pulsation triggering in gated scans. The dictionary simulation was able to flexibly account for spin relaxation during varying waiting times. As shown in the results of in vivo scans, no significant difference was identified in T1, T2, and ADC maps between scans, even though each scan had different timing due to subject\u2010dependent pulsation gating. The waiting time of the non\u2010gated scans could be improved, so the phase errors due to physiological motion are incoherent across hundreds of MRF images. When mapping the tissue properties using a dictionary with ideal signal evolutions, the more incoherent phase errors may lead to a less biased estimation, similar to the high robustness of MRF to aliasing artifacts and spiral gradients induced errors shown in previous works. 38  Design and optimization of the diffusion gradients 50 ,  51 ,  77  in terms of, for example, eddy\u2010current reduction can be implemented to further improve image quality and parameter accuracy. 61 ,  77  The mdMRF pulse sequence can also be further optimized because the current implementations, including excitations, timing, location, and values of the preparation modules, were heuristically designed. Our group proposed a physics\u2010inspired optimization framework for MRF recently that uses a cost\u2010function based on explicit first\u2010principle simulation of systematic errors arising from undersampling and phase errors. 78  This framework will be applied to optimize mdMRF for better quantification of relaxation and diffusion simultaneously. In terms of extending the current implementation to volumetric acquisitions, fast imaging techniques, such as simultaneous multi\u2010slice acquisition, 79 ,  80 ,  81  3D sampling strategies, 39 ,  40  and optimized interleaved scans 36 ,  69  will be investigated. Finally, phase correction techniques proposed previously are promising approaches to address FISP\u2010based acquisition without pulsation gating. Because variable density spiral trajectories can be implemented in the mdMRF scans, the phase errors may be estimated first by reconstructing low resolution images from densely sampled spirals and corrected using low\u2010rank or sparsity constraint reconstructions. 74",
                "Finally, in this study, we implemented mdMRF scans with tensor\u2010valued diffusion encoding, including linear and spherical b\u2010tensors. Previous work showed that tensor\u2010valued diffusion encoding may bring additional information to investigations of schizophrenia, 28  brain tumors, 18 ,  82 ,  83  multiple sclerosis, 84  cortical malformations, 85  prostate tumors, 86  healthy brain, 8 ,  87  and kidneys. 88  In these studies, the signal from LTE and STE scans were used to, for example, extract the microscopic diffusion anisotropy which is sensitive to the changes in the microscopic level while it is not influenced by the orientational order of the tissue. Because the main focus of this study was to investigate the feasibility and scan efficiency of using different b\u2010tensors for the joint relaxation and diffusion quantification, we applied only three diffusion directions in the mdMRF\u2010LTE scans for the purpose of the ADC measurement. Future work will be to increase the diffusion directions of the LTE and to incorporate both LTE and STE in a single mdMRF scan to provide microscopic anisotropy maps. Both sequence design and multi\u2010compartment model will be further optimized to efficiently encode and quantify additional tissue dimensions. We acknowledge that the current implementation of mdMRF scans are 2D scans with asymmetric voxels. Asymmetric voxels are known to introduce confounding effects in measures of voxel\u2010scale diffusion anisotropy, for example in DTI, due to the interaction between voxel and structure geometry. 89  This is especially relevant if the data are also intended to support tractography, where isotropic spatial resolution is preferable. 90 ,  91  The volumetric implementations especially with 3D volumetric excitation will allow mdMRF scans to have isotropic image resolution and address this concern while providing microscopic anisotropy information."
