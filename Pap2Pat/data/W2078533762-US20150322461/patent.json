                        "Alcoholic fermentation represents the largest application of the yeast Saccahromyces cerevisiae in the field of industrial biotechnology with the production of over 80 billion liters of fuel, industrial and beverage ethanol in 2011. Over the past decade and due to economic and environmental reasons, the world has experienced exponential growth in the production of fuel ethanol (Schubert, 2006). Though lignocellulose is considered to be one of the most promising feedstocks for production of fuel ethanol, the current industrial production of fuel ethanol relies heavily on the fermentation of traditional feedstocks such as sucrose (derived primarily from sugarcane or sweet sugar beets) and glucose obtained from starchy materials (corn, wheat, barley, potatoes etc). The most common organism currently used for bioethanol production is the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast catabolizes glucose via the glycolytic Embeden Meyerhof Pathway (EMP) pathway yielding 2 moles ATP per mole of consumed glucose. The efficiency of this pathway in yeast is low with a maximal biomass yield of around 7% and an ethanol yield in the range 90 and 93% of the theoretical value (Ingledew, 1999). However, at industrial scale the 7% of the sugar that is converted to cell mass represents a huge amount of by-product, which though valuable as animal feed significantly lowers the overall yield of the target product, ethanol. Even a slight improvement in ethanol yield by S. cerevisiae, can add several millions 1 liters of ethanol to the worldwide production of ethanol production annually.",
                        "In contrast to S. cerevisiae, the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis ferments glucose through Entner Doudorf (ED) pathway. This pathway gives only 1 mole of ATP per mole of glucose, and directs only 3% of glucose to cell biomass achieving ethanol yield of up to 97% of the possible theoretical value (Sprenger, 1996). This indicates that lowering the level of ATP yield during alcoholic fermentation increases ethanol yield with reduced substrate conversion to cell mass. Furthermore, Z. mobilis has another important advantage over S. cerevisiae: in faster fermentation of glucose to ethanol (Sprenger, 1996, Panesar et al., 2006), The higher productivity of Z. mobilis is frequently attributed to faster rate of sugar uptake and subsequent catabolism rather than low ATP yield. Attempts to substitute S. cerevisiae by Z. mobilis for the production of industrial ethanol were considered to increase ethanol yield by 3-4% thereby adding several hundred million liters worldwide annually. However, Z. mobilis has several serious drawbacks which hamper its industrial use and these consist of: (i) a very narrow substrate range (sucrose is hardly fermented with low yield), (ii) natural auxotrophy for lysine, methionine and some vitamins, (iii) non-GRAS status, which prevents use of biomass as feed additive, (iv) requirement for a higher pH to grow (Jeffries, 2005; Bai et al., 2008; Abbas, unpublished finding). Furthermore, the technology of yeast cell utilization for alcoholic fermentation is well developed whereas the use of bacterial cells for ethanol production is far less common. Thus, a better approach to increase ethanol yield and reduce cell mass production is to construct yeast strains which yield less ATP during alcoholic fermentation (e.g. one mole ATP, as Z. mobilis does in ED pathway). These new yeast strains would combine all of the possible advantages of yeast with the high ethanol yield of Z. mobilis. There are several approaches that can be used to achieve this goal, for example: substitution of EMP pathway in yeast by ED pathway from Z. mobilis or other bacteria possessing genes of the pathway; increasing the activity of enzymes involved in generation of futile cycles; construction of recombinant strains with elevated ATPase activity; and the introduction of heterologous genes encoding for plasma membrane symporters.",
                        "The first approach tried was to express ED dehydratase and ED aldolase genes edd and eda in a phosphofructokinase deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae (Lancashire et al., 1998). The yeast transformants obtained grew and fermented glucose to ethanol, though activities of ED dehydratase and ED aldolase were not measured. The work described in this patented work, was not further developed as there is no additional reports in the scientific literature. Quite often prokaryotic enzymes display low or no activity in S. cerevisiae hosts (Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 2007). This is probably due in part to improper folding or instability of the expressed bacterial protein products in yeast. In addition, there are difficulties in NADP regeneration in the yeast engineered ED pathway as NADPH produced in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, cannot be reoxidized via alcohol dehydrogenase reaction. It has already been reported that the major alcohol dehydrogenases in S. cerevisiae utilize NADH but not NADPH and yeast does not possess NADH/NADPH transhydrogenase (Lescovac et al., 2002; Jeffries and Jin, 2004). In order to maintain a low level of ATP during yeast alcoholic fermentation through EMP pathway, it is not necessary to substitute it for a pathway with lower efficiency. A better approach to achieve the above is to keep EMP pathway unchanged and to lower level of ATP by a more specific approaches that rely on the activation of some cytosolic ATPase or via the induction or construction of some kind of futile cycle to dissipate cellular pool of ATP.",
                        "In our previous work, we carried out a successful attempt to decrease intracellular ATP level by overexpression of 5\u2032 part of the S. cerevisiae SSBl gene encoding cytosolic ATPase domain and by the heterologous gene apy encoding apyrase from Escherichia coli (Sibirny et al., 2010). Some of the constructed strains showed a decrease in cellular ATP level during anaerobic, aerobic or semi-anaerobic cultivation and were characterized by a reduction in cellular biomass yield with the corresponding increase in ethanol yield during glucose utilization under anaerobic, aerobic or semi-anaerobic conditions. We suggested that this approach can be useful tor the construction of a new generation of industrial strains of S. cerevisiae which are characterized by improved ethanol yield from conventional (glucose, sucrose) and non-conventional (lignocellulose) feedstocks.",
                        "In this application we describe another approach to lowering cellular ATP by overexpression of intact or truncated versions of the S. cerevisiae PHO8 gene, encoding alkaline phosphatase."

                                "S. cerevisiae unspecific alkaline phosphatise, encoded by gene PHO8, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the diphosphate bonds in different compounds including ATP (Kaneko et al., 1982). Therefore this enzyme may operate as other ATPases. In order to carry out the hydrolysis of diphosphate bonds in cells The activity of this enzyme need to be quite high. The activity of this cloned enzyme in S. cerevisiae cells depends on many factors, among them strength of chosen promoter, stability of produced mRNA, absence of posttranslational enzyme inhibition, and the number of copies of the gene integrated into the host genome. We have shown that ADH1 promoter of the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase provides inducible expression of target genes, under the conditions of alcoholic fermentation (Sibirny et al, 2011). We decided to use this promoter for PHO8 gene expression. In order to get higher copy number of PHO8 gene integrated into the yeast genome, an integrative plasmid containing \u03b4 sequences was constructed. The S. cerevisiae \u03b4 sequences are the long terminal repeats of the retro-transposons Ty1 and Ty2. A total of approximately 425 \u03b4 sequences are typically dispersed throughout the yeast genome. It was shown that usage of \u03b4 sequences-based vectors, can provide tandem multicopy integration in one or several sites of yeast genomic DNA via homologous recombination (Lee and Da Silva, 1997). The \u03b4 sequences-based plasmid harboring PHO8 gene under the control of ADH promoter was constructed as described in Materials and Methods and subsequently transformed into S. cerevisiae laboratory strain BY4742.",

Thus, this constructed expression vector can be used for efficient multi-copy integration into the genome of a Saccharomyces host.",

This result can be explained by the vacuolar localization of the alkaline phosphatase that may hinder ATP hydrolysis. In order to test we decided to construct strains containing gene encoding truncated version of alkaline phosphatase that will remain in the cytoplasm instead of being delivered to the vacuole. However there are several drawbacks that prevent that obstruct the generation of an active cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase. First, it was shown that alkaline phosphatase is synthesized as an inactive precursor containing a C-terminal propeptide that is afterwards cleaved from the protein in vacuole in a PEP4-dependent manner (Klionsky D. and Emr S. D. 1989). During vacuolar delivery, which shares the same early stages with the secretory pathway, the precursor form of this enzyme is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. It has also been shown that the active form of alkaline phosphatase receives its metal cofactor zinc in the vacuole rather than in earlier compartments of the secretory pathway (Qiao W. et al. 1985). To estimate how these factors influence this enzyme's activity, we decided to produce several truncated forms of alkaline phosphatase. The first form lacks 60 initial amino acids that are responsible for transmembrane protein delivery; and 22 terminal amino acids, that composite the C-terminal propeptide that is normally cleaved from the protein in the vacuole. The second form has an extracellular export signal from mating pheromone a-factor (MFl\u03b1) instead of its natural delivery signal, and, finally, the third form constructed has an extracellular export signal from acid phosphatase (gene PHO5).",

The presence of these expression cassettes was confirmed after transformation by PCR.",

The intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity in strains containing plasmid pUC57-delta1\u20142-ADHpr-PHO8_trunc-CYCt-kanMX was at the same level as in strains with intact form of PHO8. Intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity in strains containing plasmid pUC57-delta1\u20142-ADHpr-MAT\u03b1sign.-PHO8_trunc-CYCt-kanMX was very low, almost in the same level as in WT strain. Most likely this form of alkaline phosphatase is secreted from the cells. The intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity of strains containing plasmid pUC57-delta1\u20142-ADHpr-PHO5sign.-PHO8_trunc-CYCt-kanMX was high on the first day of cultivation. This activity decreased on the second day of cultivation and this can be explained by the delay in the export of the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase. (FIG. 9 A, B).",
                                "Growth kinetics of the constructed recombinants was tested. Almost all strains with different truncated PHO8 forms had impaired growth on the first and, to a lesser degree by the second day of cultivation (FIG. 10) These recombinant strains especially those that had a truncated form of alkaline phospatase that remains in the cell's cytoplasm produced significantly less ethanol, also (FIG. 11). This indicates that the cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase also strongly influences the level of other cellular phosphorylated compounds, that affect all of the metabolic pathways, in particular, the reactions responsible for alcoholic fermentation.",
