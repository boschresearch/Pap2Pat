    "title": "Comparison of Three Clinical Trial Treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Multivariate Analysis of Changes in Metabolic Profiles and Adaptive Behavior",
    "date": "2018-12-19",
    "abstract": "Several studies associate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pathophysiology with metabolic abnormalities related to DNA methylation and intracellular redox homeostasis. In this regard, three completed clinical trials are reexamined in this work: treatment with (i) methylcobalamin in combination with low-dose folinic acid, (ii) tetrahydrobiopterin, and (iii) high-dose folinic acid for counteracting abnormalities in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS) pathways and also for improving ASD-related symptoms and behaviors. Although effects of treatment on individual metabolites and behavioral measures have previously been investigated, this study is the first to consider the effect of interventions on a set of metabolites of the FOCM/TS pathways and to correlate metabolic changes with behavioral improvements across several studies. To do so, this work uses data from one case-control study and the three clinical trials to develop multivariate models for considering these aspects of treatment. Fisher discriminant analysis is first used to establish a model for distinguishing individuals with ASD from typically developing controls, which is subsequently evaluated on the three treatment data sets, along with one data set for a placebo, to characterize the shift of FOCM/TS metabolism towards that of the typically developing population. Treatment with methylcobalamin plus low-dose folinic acid and, separately, treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin significantly shifted the metabolites towards the values of the control group. Contrary to this, treatment with high-dose folinic acid had a lesser, though still noticeable, effect whilst the placebo group showed marginal, but not insignificant, variations in metabolites. A second analysis is then performed with nonlinear kernel partial least squares regression to predict changes in adaptive behavior, quantified by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite, from changes in FOCM/TS biochemical measurements provided by treatment. Incorporating the 74 samples receiving any treatment, including placebo, into the regression analysis yields an R2 of 0.471 after cross-validation when using changes in six metabolic measurements as predictors. These results are suggestive of an ability to effectively improve pathway-wide FOCM/TS metabolic and behavioral abnormalities in ASD with clinical treatment.",

                "Deficits in communication and behavior are the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to affect one out of 59 children in the United States (Baio et al., 2018). The national economic burden of ASD in 2015 was calculated to be $268 billion, similar to the costs of diabetes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Leigh and Du, 2015). ASD is a highly heterogeneous disorder in terms of how it presents itself in each individual, with as many as 95% of diagnosed children also affected by at least one co-occurring condition (Soke et al., 2018) and regressive forms of the disorder not being uncommon (Ozonoff et al., 2018). Despite the large body of research investigating the etiology of ASD, there is relatively limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder aside from complex interactions between genetic and environmental contributors being involved (Gaugler et al., 2014).",
                "As a result of the heterogeneity and lack of biological understanding of ASD, the current standards for diagnosis are clinical evaluations of patient behavior, which while comprehensive do not offer the objective assessment of ASD status that a biomarker can offer. A consequence of this gap in knowledge is initial ASD diagnoses being made at a median age of 4 years (Baio et al., 2018) even though stable diagnoses have been shown to be possible at 2 years of age in a large percentage of children (Ozonoff et al., 2015). Given that earlier behavioral intervention typically leads to milder ASD-related symptoms and improved development of social and behavioral skills later in life (Fein et al., 2017), it is of great interest to achieve improved methods of ASD screening. Identification of biological markers for diagnosing ASD or assessing ASD risk status would thus represent a significant step toward improving long-term outcomes in individuals with ASD.",
                "Potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis may involve the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS) pathways as these pathways have been linked to metabolic abnormalities in ASD in several studies. Case\u2013control studies show that markers of DNA methylation and intracellular redox status are significantly different in individuals with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) peers (James et al., 2006; Melnyk et al., 2012), suggesting perturbations both in the epigenetic control of gene expression and in the control of intracellular oxidative stress. Subsequent studies have found a strong ability to classify individuals as having ASD or being TD, as well as predict adaptive behavior, based on these measurements (Howsmon et al., 2017, 2018; Li et al., 2018). Development of a mathematical model of these pathways with parameters estimated from clinical data has also pointed to several metabolic reactions that may be disrupted in individuals with ASD (Vargason et al., 2017b).",
                "Aside from investigating FOCM/TS metabolites for diagnostic purposes, correcting activity in the FOCM and TS pathways may affect underlying biological processes that contribute to ASD pathophysiology, thus making metabolic abnormalities in these pathways promising targets for clinical treatment (Frye and Rossignol, 2016). Furthermore, it has been suggested that early detection of metabolic dysfunction to determine ASD risk and allowing for proactive treatment strategies could potentially lead to practical intervention plans for at least a subset of those at risk for ASD (Slattery et al., 2016). Since the aim of treatment is not just to correct metabolic abnormalities but also to alleviate the primary behavioral symptoms of ASD, it would be of great value to determine treatment targets where improvements in metabolic activity give rise to amelioration of observed behavior. Previous studies by the authors have investigated the effects of treatment with methylcobalamin (MeCbl) in combination with low-dose folinic acid (LDFA) (James et al., 2009), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (Frye et al., 2013a), and high-dose folinic acid (HDFA) (Frye et al., 2016b) for improving metabolic and behavioral outcomes in individuals with ASD (Delhey et al., 2018). The growing body of literature describing the efficacy of these treatments suggests unique mechanisms by which each acts upon metabolic pathways that may be dysfunctional in ASD.",
                "Methylcobalamin, one treatment option for ASD that has been explored, is a cofactor for the methionine synthase enzyme that contributes to the process of DNA methylation. Levels of methionine synthase messenger RNA in the frontal cortex typically decrease with age, but this decrease has been found to occur more quickly in ASD even though actual levels of the enzyme do not appear to be affected significantly (Muratore et al., 2013). Concentrations of MeCbl in the frontal cortex of children with ASD have been measured to be three times lower than those in TD individuals, with an associated threefold decrease in methionine synthase activity also measured (Zhang et al., 2016). It has been suggested that cobalamin transporter polymorphisms and mutations (James et al., 2006; Nashabat et al., 2017) may contribute to the development of ASD. Open-label (James et al., 2009; Frye et al., 2013b) and double-blind placebo-controlled (Bertoglio et al., 2010; Hendren et al., 2016) studies of MeCbl treatment have observed improvement in metabolism and ASD-related symptoms in children with the disorder.",
                "Another studied treatment for ASD involves BH4, which has diverse roles in monoamine neurotransmitter production, phenylalanine breakdown, and nitric oxide synthesis (Frye et al., 2010). Reduced cerebrospinal fluid levels of BH4 have been reported in children with ASD, with one study reporting these levels to be only 42% of those found in TD children (Tani et al., 1994) and a small open-label trial of BH4 requiring deficient levels as an inclusion criterion (Fernell et al., 1997). Analysis of genes related to BH4 pathways has suggested that the synthesis of BH4 may be impaired in individuals with ASD (Schnetz-Boutaud et al., 2009). One double-blind placebo-controlled study with BH4 observed increases in social interaction after 6 months of treatment (Danfors et al., 2005), while a more recent trial described significant improvements in ASD-related mannerisms, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech, and social awareness (Klaiman et al., 2013). Although it is unclear which underlying biological mechanisms are targeted by BH4 treatment, its therapeutic effect may derive from its correction of oxidative stress and overall folate metabolism in the central nervous system (Frye, 2014).",
                "Folinic acid is also a potential treatment for ASD and is a naturally occurring form of folate, which is required for purine and pyrimidine productions, aids in the transfer of carbon during the process of amino acid synthesis, and contributes to DNA methylation processes (Wagner, 2001). Early studies of folate deficiency in the central nervous system indicated a potential connection to cases of ASD and other neurological deficits (Ramaekers et al., 2007; Moretti et al., 2008), with later studies also reporting increased levels of folate receptor autoantibodies in the blood to be correlated with the presentation of ASD-related symptoms and physiology (Frye et al., 2013c, 2016a). Additionally, higher rates of developmental deficits and ASD-like behaviors have been observed in animal models administered folate receptor antibodies during gestation and the pre-weaning period (Sequeira et al., 2016; Desai et al., 2017). The use of folate supplements during pregnancy may serve to combat these deleterious effects as it has been associated with a reduced risk of ASD in the child (Schmidt et al., 2012; Sur\u00e9n et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017); this is likely due to folate\u2019s protective effect for proper neural tube development (Blom, 2009; Schmidt et al., 2011; Frye et al., 2017). Treatment with folinic acid has also been found to correct certain abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid and improve ASD-related symptoms and behavior (Moretti et al., 2005; Ramaekers et al., 2007; Frye et al., 2016b).",
                "Even though a number of studies have tested the effect of treatment on individually measured compounds or on certain behavioral measures in individuals with ASD, no study exists that investigates the effect of a treatment on combinations of metabolites of the FOCM/TS pathways and correlates pathway-wide changes to shifts in behavioral measures. This work addresses this point by using multivariate analysis on the metabolites of FOCM/TS in order to compare the effectiveness of (i) MeCbl + LDFA (James et al., 2009), (ii) BH4 (Frye et al., 2013a), (iii) HDFA (Frye et al., 2016b), and (iv) placebo treatment for normalizing the metabolic profiles of individual with ASD to more closely resemble those of TD individuals. Furthermore, a correlation is developed between changes in the metabolites and changes in adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite, that are brought about by these treatments."

For this objective, kernel partial least squares (KPLS), a non-linear extension of the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm, was used (Rosipal and Trejo, 2001). KPLS regression handles noisy and collinear data well compared to ordinary least squares and is a more appropriate choice when the number of observations is small compared to the number of variables (H\u00f6skuldsson, 1988), as is the case in this work. The regression task begins with the predictor variable set X (containing pre-to-post-treatment changes in FOCM/TS measurements) and the response variable set Y (containing pre-to-post-treatment changes in the VABS Composite). To initiate the PLS algorithm, a projection vector for the n samples contained in X is determined and a separate projection vector for the n samples contained in Y is identified. The projections of X and Y are then used to calculate the regression coefficients for the model. Further projection directions can be found by subtracting the contributions of the previous directions from X and Y and repeating the regression procedure.",

The algorithm then proceeds in a modified form of linear PLS to identify the regression model for predicting Y from F, rather than from X. Gaussian kernel functions are used in this work for the non-linear transformation \u03a6(X). Here, X contains the pre-to-post-treatment changes of a subset of the measured metabolites and Y describes the pre-to-post-treatment change in the VABS Composite.

This technique removes one sample from the data set, identifies the FDA or KPLS model that fits the remaining data, and then uses the model to predict the sample that was removed. The sample is then replaced and the procedure repeated until all samples have been individually removed once. For classification, the confusion matrix is then constructed using the cross-validated predictions instead of the fitted discriminant scores. Similarly, the sum of squared errors for assessing a regression model is computed as the difference between the measured and the predicted, rather than the fitted, values.

Inclusion of all 15 available measurements was undesirable as overfitting on the training data then becomes more likely due to a low observation-to-variable ratio; this subsequently increases the likelihood of prediction error when validating the model on new data. It was thus of initial interest to determine the smallest set of variables that yielded a satisfactory separation between the ASD and TD cohorts described in the IMAGE data set. To this end, all possible combinations of measurements were exhaustively tested with FDA. The separation between cohorts offered by each variable combination was quantified by the C-statistic resulting from model fitting; the C-statistic is one metric for assessing classifier performance and its value ranges from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1.0 (perfect classification). Upon reviewing the maximum C-statistic obtained for each given number of variables (Figure 2), it was determined that five variables, giving a C-statistic of 0.967, offered a balance between low numbers of variables and strong classifier performance.",
                        "The subset of five variables including methionine, cysteine, Cys-Gly, GSSG, and percent oxidized was selected as the best candidate and was then evaluated with FDA using cross-validation (Figure 3). This model predicted the left-out samples with a sensitivity of 88.0% and specificity of 90.2%, indicating very good classification accuracy. Investigation of each variable\u2019s contribution to the model\u2019s discriminant score (Figure 4) revealed that individuals\u2019 scores were most strongly associated with their measurement for percent oxidized glutathione; study participants classified as TD typically had lower percentages of oxidized glutathione compared to those classified as having ASD. The variable with the second greatest influence in the model was methionine, which was the only included methylation metabolite among a large majority of glutathione precursors and redox measurements (cysteine, Cys-Gly, GSSG, and percent oxidized).",
                        "While the chosen FDA model included many more glutathione precursors and redox markers than methylation metabolites, it was important to determine if this held up for other models that performed almost as well. To investigate individual variable contributions beyond the best model, the frequencies with which each of the fifteen measurements were used in five-variable models offering a fitted C-statistic of 0.96 or greater were considered (Figure 5). This criterion was satisfied by 85 FDA models, out of a possible 3003 five-variable models overall, and it was found that the variables methionine, cysteine, and percent oxidized each appeared in more than 84% of these models while no other measurement was used in more than 32% of models. The measurement of percent oxidized, specifically, was used in almost 98% of the top models, reinforcing its importance for distinguishing participants in the ASD and TD cohorts."

PDFs of the resulting discriminant scores were estimated and compared to the ASD and TD distributions generated from the IMAGE data (Figure 6); the treatments producing the largest pre-to-post-treatment shifts toward the TD distribution can be understood as those offering the greatest improvements to overall FOCM/TS metabolic status. These shifts were quantified as the change in Type II error associated with the PDFs, with respect to the null hypothesis H0, brought about by each treatment. MeCbl + LDFA produced the largest increase in Type II error (Table 2), followed by BH4, indicating that these treatments were the most successful in altering the FOCM/TS profiles of individuals with ASD to more closely reflect those of TD individuals. Treatment with HDFA produced a relatively small increase in Type II error; however, due to the Type II error in this group being very large initially, the post-HDFA treatment error was actually the greatest among all treatments. As a result, the 95% CI for the effect size of HDFA contained zero, whereas the 95% CIs for the other treatments did not contain zero. The 95% CI for the placebo unexpectedly did not contain zero, indicating a small, but statistically significant, metabolic shift in this group."

The next part of this investigation involved the use of KPLS regression to predict changes in adaptive behavior (as quantified by the VABS Composite score) from changes in FOCM/TS measurements resulting from treatment. Thus, the predictor variables in the regression were the pre-to-post-treatment changes in metabolic measurements while the response variable was the pre-to-post-treatment change in VABS Composite. All treatment groups, including the placebo group, were included in the regression (74 samples in total) so as to capture a range of biochemical/behavioral effects and to further guard against overfitting by using metabolites from as many participants as possible. It should also be noted that this analysis is independent of the treatment used as only the changes in the pre-to-post-treatment are correlated with changes in the VABS scores and information about the treatment itself is not used for regression. That being said, the type of treatment used affects the pre-to-post-treatment changes in the metabolites, but the treatment information is only implicitly and not explicitly involved in this analysis.",
                        "Similar to the classification task, the initial step for this analysis was to identify an appropriate subset of input variables for the KPLS model. All combinations of each number of variables were exhaustively tested and the R2 from cross-validation was used as the evaluation criterion for the regression. Comparing the maximum R2 given by each number of input variables (Figure 7) showed the model performance to decrease when more than six variables were used. The highest cross-validated R2 of 0.471 was obtained using \u0394methionine, \u0394Glu-Cys, \u0394Cys-Gly, \u0394tGSH, \u0394tGSH/GSSG, and \u0394fGSH/GSSG as predictor variables in the regression, where \u0394 indicates the pre-to-post-treatment change of a particular metabolite or metabolite ratio. The predictions from fitting and cross-validation with this model are provided in Figure 8. Although this particular combination of variables gave the best model performance under cross-validation, a number of other combinations offered similar prediction accuracy; the five top-performing models using six predictor variables are listed in Table 3 to demonstrate this point. The frequency of appearance for all fifteen study variables in these combinations was considered across all six-variable models producing an R2 of 0.35 or greater after cross-validation (Figure 9); in total, 137 combinations (out of a possible 5005) met this criterion. Methylation metabolites, glutathione precursors, and redox markers appeared with overall similar frequency in these top combinations, although the single model with the highest cross-validated R2 was dominated by glutathione precursors and redox measures."

                "Classification of ASD and TD cohorts in this work showed that multivariate analysis can uncover very good separation between these groups with a classifier sensitivity of 88.0% and specificity of 90.2%. Previous work by the authors used FDA on the same data from the IMAGE study to achieve correct classification in 97.6% of individuals with ASD and 96.1% of TD individuals (Howsmon et al., 2017). That study had the advantage of using additional measures of DNA methylation (percent methylated DNA), chronic oxidative stress (8-hydroxyguanosine, chlorotyrosine, and nitrotyrosine), redox metabolism (free cystine, free cysteine, and free cystine/free cysteine), and amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan) for classification that were not available for the current work due to our use of additional data sets where some or all of these measurements were not available. As a result of using fewer measurements, however, we were able to include additional samples from the IMAGE data set that were previously omitted on the basis of them missing one or more of the aforementioned measurements; this provided 92 ASD and 82 TD in the current study compared to the 83 ASD and 76 TD reported previously (Howsmon et al., 2017). Thus, the discrepancy in classification accuracy may arise from the larger group of samples, but differences in measurement availability likely have a larger role.",
                "Our identified FDA model placed significant weight on FOCM/TS measurements related to oxidative stress while measurements linked to DNA methylation were of less importance. The measurement for percent oxidized glutathione especially dominated the classification decision, with the magnitude of its parameter weight greater than the total combined weight given to the other model inputs. This may indicate that processes closely related to glutathione metabolism are more abnormal in individuals with ASD than are DNA methylation processes; it can at least be said that these particular measurements of redox metabolism are more accurate indicators of ASD status than the methylation markers that were considered in this study. Li et al. (2018) did find that the measure of percent DNA methylation has even greater importance to the ASD/TD classification than percent oxidized glutathione, but due to the aforementioned restrictions on our data sets we were unable to include percent DNA methylation in our analyses.",
                "Through evaluation of the FDA model on the clinical trial data sets, the MeCbl + LDFA treatment was found to provide the greatest correction in ASD-related metabolic abnormalities, with the effects of BH4 just slightly smaller; both of these treatments increased the rate of ASD misclassification by more than 40% each. It is worth noting that individuals in both of these studies had poor FOCM/TS metabolic status at baseline (James et al., 2009; Frye et al., 2013a), a point that is reflected in the low pre-treatment Type II errors associated with these groups in our analysis. These groups were thus expected to be the most responsive to treatment and the large shift in PDFs resulting from these treatments could be partly explained by these baseline characteristics. In contrast, the Type II error was large in the HDFA group even before treatment, leaving less room for improvement with the treatment. The post-HDFA treatment participants did have nearly a 50% misclassification rate, indicating some ability of HDFA to improve metabolic status despite its 95% CI for effect size containing zero. However, given that the initial measurements in the HDFA group were considerably better than those for the MeCbl + LDFA and BH4 groups, it is difficult to state whether HDFA could have offered a more significant metabolic correction than what was observed. It should be mentioned that the HDFA treatment was not aimed at correcting peripheral metabolism, but was rather designed to increase deficient central folate metabolism. These data in fact support the mechanism of action proposed for the HDFA, which is to increase central folate, rather than change peripheral metabolism since the behavioral effect of HDFA was strong despite little change in peripheral metabolism. This also supports the notion that HDFA can complement these other treatments in order to improve multiple pathophysiological abnormalities associated with ASD. Finally, the placebo group expectedly had a relatively small change in Type II error, but the effect size from placebo treatment was unexpectedly significant. This could possibly be attributed to a decrease in the percent oxidized glutathione that was measured in a number of participants receiving the placebo, which would explain the shift of the PDF toward the TD side.",
                "All treatments clearly provided some degree of metabolic correction. Despite the improvements, however, no treatment came close to offering complete normalization of FOCM/TS metabolism; the highest ASD misclassification rate was 49.5% in the HDFA treatment group. Based on the results of the initial FDA model identification, total normalization of a treatment group would be achieved when 11% of the distribution is classified as ASD, or similarly when the Type II error is 89%. There is thus a significant gap between the observed effect and what could potentially be achieved, and while this is not unexpected given the complex pathophysiology of ASD, it does give an indication of the magnitude of metabolic abnormalities even after treatment.",
                "Our finding that changes in adaptive behavior could be regressed onto changes in biochemical measurements with an R2 of 0.471 after cross-validation indicates that deviations from a person\u2019s baseline FOCM/TS measurements correlate significantly with deviations from their baseline behavior. This may be suggestive of a biological mechanism by which abnormalities in FOCM/TS processes lead to certain alterations in neurological activity; it is also possible that the converse is true. Importantly, a number of variable combinations produced very good R2 values after cross-validation, with several metabolites appearing in many top-performing combinations even though no measurements appeared in all combinations and even the least predictive measurements appeared in some combinations. This can be explained by the interconnected structure of FOCM and TS where the effects of metabolites are non-linearly dependent on one another (Vargason et al., 2017a); for example, some biochemical measurements may be predictive of behavioral changes only when they are grouped with a specific subset of other biochemical measurements, and less informative when considered independently of these other measures. The lesser importance of glutathione/redox measurements for prediction of adaptive behavior relative to the importance of these measurements in the classification task may be explained by KPLS uncovering certain non-linear relationships that the linear analysis of FDA did not describe; it is also possible that the glutathione/redox measurements simply correlate more strongly with ASD or TD status than they do with adaptive behavior. Finally, the significance of our result arising from cross-validation must be emphasized, as it indicates that the regression model is capable of predicting new data not used during model training, a conclusion that could not be made from a fitted result alone (Frye et al., 2013b).",
                "It could be argued that the placebo group should not be included in the regression analysis since significant changes in metabolites or behavior should not be observed in this group. However, it is possible that small fluctuations in metabolic activity may still correlate to small changes in adaptive behavior regardless of whether these changes are due to a treatment or are happening because of other factors. Ideally, a model would be able to capture changes both large and small arising from these sources, and while the treatment groups provide information about the former, the latter would be uncharacterized without analyzing the placebo group. The inclusion of participants receiving the placebo also substantially increases the number of samples for model training and cross-validation, providing further safeguard against overfitting. Considering these perspectives, using the placebo group is likely to give a more robust estimate of the correlation between metabolic and behavioral changes.",
                "Interpretation of the presented results may be influenced by limitations in the design of the current study as well as those of the studies from which the clinical data were obtained. The clinical limitations have been previously discussed in their respective studies (James et al., 2009; Melnyk et al., 2012; Frye et al., 2013a, 2016b), so only the limitations directly relevant to the current study\u2019s design will be discussed here. One of the largest sources of error in this study arises from its use of data from four separate clinical data sets, which may introduce variation into the biochemical and behavioral measurements with regard to the procedures and study populations used for data collection. Different baseline characteristics for the separate treatment groups affect our ability to directly compare the effects of each treatment, since the magnitudes of these effects likely depend on the initial severity of the metabolic abnormalities, that is, someone with very irregular metabolic status may have much more potential for improvement than a person with less severe abnormalities. Another important limitation is the small samples sizes used in some of the studies, which restricted our ability to find statistically meaningful differences. As a direct result of this, many of our findings are suggestive of substantial treatment effects, but not as significant as would be desired from these treatments. With the BH4 data in particular, the inclusion of only eight participants could make the evaluation of meaningful effects more challenging; however, since these data alone were not used to fit models and were used only for model validation (as with FDA) or when combined with other data sets (as with KPLS), this concern is at least partially indirectly addressed. Averaging the 8- and 16-week measurements from the BH4 study to obtain a 12-week estimate also has some associated risk as certain measurements might not scale linearly between the two time points. Additionally, VABS Composite scores reported in the open-label trials are susceptible to expectation bias and it cannot be said with certainty if these reported scores accurately reflect the true adaptive behavior observed at the time of the trial. A final point of note is that variations in cognitive levels of participants could potentially have effects on treatment outcomes, but we were unable to assess these effects since intelligence measures were not available in the clinical data.",
                "Everything considered, the multivariate analysis performed in this study offers further insight into the metabolic and behavioral improvements resulting from clinical treatment of individuals with ASD. Classification via FDA model identification and validation provided additional measures of treatment efficacy that went beyond univariate comparisons of individual measurements, and instead considered the combined contributions of multiple markers toward FOCM/TS metabolic status. The use of KPLS regression to predict changes in adaptive behavior from changes in metabolites also represents an important step toward the development of a clinical trial target for ASD that captures both metabolic and behavioral effects offered by a particular treatment. Together, these results suggest that dysfunction in metabolism and the brain in individuals with ASD may not occur as isolated systems, but rather as one connected system in ASD pathophysiology."
