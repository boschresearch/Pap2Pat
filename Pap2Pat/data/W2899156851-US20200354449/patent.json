                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death. It is a class of diseases caused by malignant transformation of healthy cells, resulting from genetic alterations, like chromosomal translocations, mutations in tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors or growth-factor receptors, leading to the immortalization of the cells. If the immortalization is combined with excessive proliferation, the immortalized cells generate tumors, with or without metastasis (in case of solid tumors), or leukemias and lymphomas (cancers of the blood). Defective apoptosis, or programmed cell death, can further contribute to malignant transformation of cells leading to cancer.",
                        "A family of membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinases, consisting of the receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptors-1 and -2 (ROR1 and ROR2) have been described as specifically associated with particular cancers (Rebagay et al. (2012) Front Oncol. 2(34):1-8; doi 10.3389/onc.2012.00034), while being largely absent in expression on healthy tissue with, a few exceptions e.g. in case of ROR1 (Balakrishnan et al. (2016) Clin Cancer Res. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432). Whether or not ROR expression is functionally associated with tumorigenesis remains unclear. However, due to the very tumor-selective expression of ROR family members, they represent relevant targets for targeted cancer therapies. Importantly, human ROR2 (hROR2) has been described to be expressed on tumor cells in neuroblastoma, sarcoma (and especially osteosarcoma), renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, renal cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers.",
                        "Receptor tyrosine kinase orphan receptors-1 and -2, ROR1 and ROR2, are the only two family members defining a new receptor tyrosine kinase family, based on the overall structural design and some functional similarities. Both ROR1 and ROR2 proteins are type I-single pass trans-membrane receptors with an extracellular domain (ECD) consisting of an immunoglobulin domain, a cysteine rich frizzled domain and a Kringle domain. These three extracellular domains are followed by a trans-membrane domain connecting the ECD to an intracellular portion of the protein comprising kinase domains (Rebagay et al. (2012) Frontiers Oncol. 2: 1-8).",
                        "The human ROR1 and ROR2 proteins are 58% homologous between each other, but each of the ROR proteins is highly conserved between species. This represents a challenge for the development of human ROR2 specific monoclonal antibodies and very few antibodies are known.",
                        "In normal physiology, hROR2 is responsible for aspects of bone and cartilage growth during embryonic development. After birth, expression of hROR2 is downregulated and hROR2 is normally undetectable or expressed at very low levels in adult tissues. Weak expression of hROR2 has only been reported in stomach and thyroid issue (Morioka et al. (2009) Cancer Sci. 100: 1227-1233). hROR2 has previously been recognized as a target for the development of hROR2 specific antibodies (WO 2013/103637 A1, WO 2016/142768 A1.",
                        "There is a need for high-quality anti-ROR2 antibodies that can be used as a basis for the development of antibody-based targeted therapies of ROR2-expressing cancers. In particular, there is also a need for anti-ROR2 antibodies with excellent developability parameters, including a low propensity for aggregation, and that exhibit high thermal stability, which are typically obtained by B cells from immunized animals. Further, there is a need for antibodies that, in addition to binding human ROR2, also bind to ROR2 of standard toxicology species, like mice, rats, rabbits and/or cynomolgus monkeys, and especially to both cynomolgus and mouse ROR2, allowing toxicological characterization of antibody-based targeted therapies in anticipation of human clinical trials. Additionally, for human therapy there is a need for antibodies that are essentially fully human antibodies with lowest immunogenicity risk upon systemic administration in human subjects. There is also a need for additional diagnostic tools for detecting ROR2 expressions in ROR2-related disease conditions. The instant invention is directed to addressing these and other needs."

                        "In one aspect, the invention provides novel, high-affinity binding domains of fully human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2). In one embodiment, ROR2 is human ROR2 (hROR2).",
                        "Such monoclonal antibodies have been selected from diverse antibody libraries generated by challenging human antibody light and heavy variable domain transgenic mice (WO 2010/070263 A1, H2L2 mice) with recombinant extracellular domain of the hROR2 antigen followed by generating and screening cellular IgG1 display libraries from hROR2 challenged H2L2 mice using DNA-transposable vectors for transfection into 63-12 mouse preB-cells according to WO 2014/013026 A1. Mammalian cells displaying the antibodies according to WO 2014/013026 A1 were screened using antigen-specific cell sorting (FACS), including single-cell sorting. Eventually, antibodies secreted in the supernatant of single-cell sorted clones were subjected to antigen-binding evaluation by ELISA and secondary cancer cell killing assays (i.e., wherein a secondary antibody coupled to a toxin binds to the antigen-bound anti-hROR2 antibody at the cell surface, and is internalised to effect cell killing). Coding sequences of variable heavy and light chain domains have been identified from selected cell clones displaying hROR2-specific binding and functional characterization involving cell killing of hROR2 expressing target cells via a Fab-based toxin-conjugated secondary reagent. By this strategy novel fully human monoclonal antibodies for hROR2 of high quality and favorable functional properties have been identified.",

In particular, such ADCs are generated by site-specific conjugation, achieved by enzymatic conjugation using sortase enzyme as disclosed in WO 2014/140317 A1, which is incorporated by reference herein. One particular ultra-potent anthracycline toxin with high potency has been disclosed in WO 2016/102679 A1, which is incorporated by reference herein.",

Antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments used in the invention can be generated using any suitable technology, e.g., hybridoma technology, ribosome display, phage display, gene shuffling libraries, semi-synthetic or fully synthetic libraries or combinations thereof. Antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments of the invention include intact antibodies and antibody fragments or antigen-binding fragments that contain the antigen-binding portions of an intact antibody and retain the capacity to bind the cognate antigen. Unless otherwise specified herein, all peptide sequences, including all antibody and antigen-binding fragment sequences are referred to in N->C order.",
                                "An intact antibody typically comprises at least two heavy (H) chains (about 50-70 kD) and two light (L) chains (about 25 kD) inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The recognized immunoglobulin genes encoding antibody chains include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Each heavy chain of an antibody is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region. In the case of IgG, the heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) consist of identical antibodies molecules.",
                                "The VH and VL regions of an antibody can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, also termed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are interspersed with the more conserved framework regions (FRs). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The locations of CDR and FR regions and a numbering system have been defined, e.g., the IMGT system (Lefranc M P et al., 2015), or the Kabat numbering scheme.",
                                "Antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments of the invention also encompass single chain antibodies. The term \u201csingle chain antibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide comprising a VH domain and a VL domain in polypeptide linkage, generally linked via a spacer peptide, and which may comprise additional domains or amino acid sequences at the amino- and/or carboxyl-termini. For example, a single-chain antibody may comprise a tether segment for linking to the encoding polynucleotide. As an example, a single chain variable region fragment (scFv) is a single-chain antibody. Compared to the VL and VH domains of the Fv fragment that are coded for by separate genes, a scFv has the two domains joined (e.g., via recombinant methods) by a synthetic linker. This enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules.",
                                "Examples of antibody-based binding proteins are polypeptides in which the binding domains of the antibodies are combined with other polypeptides or polypeptide domains, e.g. alternative molecular scaffolds, Fc-regions, other functional or binding domains of other polypeptides or antibodies resulting in molecules with addition binding properties, e.g. bi- or multispecific proteins or antibodies. Such polypeptides can create an arrangement of binding or functional domains normally not found in naturally occurring antibodies or antibody fragments.",

Methods for generating these antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins and antigen-binding molecules are all well known in the art. In particular, scFv antibodies can be obtained using methods described in, e.g., Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988; and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883, 1988. Fv antibody fragments can be generated as described in Skerra and PlUckthun, Science 240:1038-41, 1988. Disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments (dsFvs) can be made using methods described in, e.g., Reiter et al., Int. J. Cancer 67:113-23, 1996. Similarly, single domain antibodies (dAbs) can be produced by a variety of methods described in, e.g., Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989; and Cai and Garen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:6280-85, 1996. Camelid single domain antibodies can be produced using methods well known in the art, e.g., Dumoulin et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 11:500-515, 2002; Ghahroudi et al., FEBS Letters 414:521-526, 1997; and Bond et al., J. Mol. Biol. 332:643-55, 2003. Other types of antigen-binding fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab\u2032)2 or Fd fragments) can also be readily produced with routinely practiced immunology methods. See, e.g., Harlow & Lane, Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1998.",

In certain embodiments, the antibody, antibody-based binding protein or antigen-binding fragment is produced using a mammalian expression system. Some specific techniques for generating the antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins or antigen-binding fragments or antigen-binding fragments of the invention are exemplified herein. In some embodiments, the antibodies, antibody-based binding proteins or antigen-binding fragments of the invention can be produced using a suitable non-eukaryotic expression system such as a bacterial expression system. Bacterial expression systems can be used to produce fragments such as a F(ab)2, Fv, scFv, IgGACH2, F(ab\u2032)2, scFv2CH3, Fab, VL, VH, scFv4, scFv3, scFv2, dsFv, Fv, scFv-Fc, (scFv)2, and diabodies.

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein.",

Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.",

Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art.

Optionally, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides (or 10 amino acids) in length, or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides (or 20, 50, 200 or more amino acids) in length.",
                                "Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, 1970; by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, 1970; by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, 1988; by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.); or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Brent et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Ringbou ed., 2003)). Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1977; and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990, respectively.",

See, e.g., Russell et al, J. Mol. Biol., 244: 332-350 (1994).",
                                "Artificial T cell receptors (also known as chimeric T cell receptors, chimeric immunoreceptors, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T-bodies) are engineered receptors, which graft an arbitrary specificity onto an immune effector cell. Typically, these receptors are used to graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T cell; with transfer of their coding sequence facilitated by retroviral or lentiviral vectors or by transposons. CAR-engineered T cells are genetically engineered T cells armed with chimeric receptors whose extracellular recognition unit is comprised of an antibody-derived recognition domain and whose intracellular region is derived from lymphocyte stimulating moiety(ies). The structure of the prototypic CAR is modular, designed to accommodate various functional domains and thereby to enable choice of specificity and controlled activation of T cells. The preferred antibody-derived recognition unit is a single chain variable fragment (scFv) that combines the specificity and binding residues of both the heavy and light chain variable regions of a monoclonal antibody, but also other antibody-derived formats like Fab fragments, V-domains etc. may be employed to confer a desired CAR specificity to CAR engineered T cells. The most common lymphocyte activation moieties include a T-cell costimulatory (e.g. CD28) domain in tandem with a T-cell triggering (e.g. CD3zeta) moiety, but also other signaling domains, like 4-1BB can be employed in the intracellular portion of CARs. By arming effector lymphocytes (such as T cells and natural killer cells) with such chimeric receptors, the engineered cell is redirected with a predefined specificity to any desired target antigen, in a non-HLA restricted manner. CAR constructs are introduced ex vivo into T cells from peripheral lymphocytes of a given patient using retroviral or lentiviral vectors or transposons. Following infusion of the resulting CAR-engineered T cells back into the patient, they traffic, reach their target site, and upon interaction with their target cell or tissue, they undergo activation and perform their predefined effector function. Therapeutic targets for the CAR approach include cancer and HIV-infected cells, or autoimmune effector cells.",

Various expression vectors can be employed to express the polynucleotides encoding the functional antibody chains or binding fragments. Both viral-based and nonviral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a mammalian host cell. Nonviral vectors and systems include plasmids, episomal vectors, typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA, and human artificial chromosomes (see, e.g., Harrington et al., Nat. Genet. 15:345, 1997). For example, nonviral vectors useful for expression of the antibody polynucleotides and polypeptides in mammalian (e.g., human) cells include pCEP4, pREP4, pThioHis A, B & C, pcDNA3.1/His, pEBVHis A, B & C (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), MPSV vectors, and numerous other vectors known in the art for expressing other proteins. Other useful nonviral vectors include vectors either comprising Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac and other transposon systems or sequences allowing the transposition of the vector components by said Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac and other transposon systems. Useful viral vectors include vectors based on lentiviruses or other retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpes viruses, vectors based on SV40, papilloma virus, HBP Epstein Barr virus, vaccinia virus vectors and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). See, Brent et al., supra; Smith, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 49:807, 1995; and Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143, 1992",
                                "The choice of expression vector depends on the intended host cells in which the vector is to be expressed. Typically, the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences (e.g., enhancers) that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding a functional antibody chain or antigen-binding fragment. In some embodiments, an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include, e.g., tetracycline-inducable, arabinose, lacZ, metallothionein promoters or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed or transfected host cells can be expanded under non-inducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters, other regulatory elements may also be required or desired for efficient expression of a functional antibody chain or fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition, the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20:125, 1994; and Bittner et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153:516, 1987). For example, the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.",
                                "The expression vectors may also provide a secretion signal sequence position to form a fusion protein with polypeptides encoded by inserted functional antibody sequences. More often, the inserted functional antibody sequences are linked to a signal sequences before inclusion in the vector. Vectors to be used to receive sequences encoding the functional antibody light and heavy chain variable domains sometimes also encode constant regions or parts thereof. Such vectors allow expression of the variable regions as fusion proteins with the constant regions thereby leading to production of intact antibodies or fragments thereof. Typically, such constant regions are human.",
                                "The host cells for harboring and expressing the functional antibody chains can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. In some preferred embodiments, mammalian host cells are used to express and produce the antibody polypeptides of the present invention. For example, they can be either a hybridoma cell line expressing endogenous immunoglobulin genes or a mammalian cell line harboring an exogenous expression vector. These include any normal mortal or normal or abnormal immortal animal or human cell. In addition to the cell lines exemplified herein, a number of other suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins are also known in the art. These include, e.g., the CHO cell lines, various HEK 293 cell lines, various Cos cell lines, HeLa cells, myeloma cell lines, transformed cells of the B-lineage and hybridomas. The use of mammalian tissue cell culture to express polypeptides is discussed generally in, e.g., Winnacker, From Genes to Clones, VCH Publishers, N.Y., N.Y., 1987. Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an enhancer, and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters may be constitutive, cell type-specific, stage-specific, and/or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include, but are not limited to, EFla and human UbC promoters exemplified herein, the metallothionein promoter, the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter, the dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter, the SV40 promoter, the MRP polIII promoter, the constitutive MPSV promoter, the tetracycline-inducible CMV promoter (such as the human immediate-early CMV promoter), the constitutive CMV promoter, and promoter-enhancer combinations known in the art.",
                                "Methods for introducing expression vectors containing the polynucleotide sequences of interest vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transformation or electroporation is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts (see generally Sambrook et al., supra). Other methods include, e.g., electroporation, calcium phosphate treatment, liposome-mediated transfection, injection and microinjection, ballistic methods, virosomes, immunoliposomes, polycation:nucleic acid conjugates, naked DNA, artificial virions, fusion to the herpes virus structural protein VP22 (Elliot and O'Hare, Cell 88:223, 1997), agent-enhanced uptake of DNA, and ex vivo transduction. For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression will often be desired. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody chains or binding fragments can be prepared using expression vectors of the invention which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following introduction of the vector, cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth of cells that successfully express the introduced sequences in selective media. Resistant, stably transfected cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate for the cell type.",

Usually, a given sortase enzyme recognizes one or more sortase recognition motifs. Sortase enzymes can be naturally occurring, or may have undergone genetic engineering (Dorr et al., 2014), and are used, in the SMAC technology, to conjugate two proteins one of which is bearing such recognition motif, while the other one is bearing a oligo-glycine peptide (Gly)n.

However, another preferred embodiment is also to directly append the sortase tag to the second last C-terminal glycine residue encoded by human Fc\u03b31 cDNA, because usually terminal lysine residues of antibody heavy chains are clipped off by posttranslational modification in mammalian cells. Therefore, in more than 90% of the cases naturally occurring human IgG1 lacks the C-terminal lysine residues of the IgG1 heavy chains. Therefore, one preferred embodiment of the invention is to omit the C-terminal lysine amino acid residues of human IgG1 heavy chain constant regions in expression constructs for sortase recognition-motif tagged Igyl heavy chains.

In the case of Ig kappa light chains, it was observed that by adding 5 amino acids between the last C-terminal cysteine amino acid of the Ig kappa light chain and the sortase pentapeptide motif improved the kinetic of conjugation, so that the C-termini of Ig kappa light chains and Ig heavy chains could be conjugated with similar kinetics (see: Beerli et al.

Alternatively, the control level can correspond to the level or mean level of ROR2 in one or more samples taken from the test subject at one or more prior times, such as when the test subject did not have or did not exhibit, a condition associated with elevated ROR2. A significantly higher level of ROR2 in the biological sample relative to the control level is indicative of a disorder associated with elevated ROR2 in the subject. In subjects such as humans, where cell surface ROR2 expression is largely restricted to embryonic development, a control level of ROR2 can be zero or none. Thus, in some embodiments of the method of detection provided by the invention, any significant and detectable amount of ROR2 in a biological sample can be indicative of a disorder associated with elevated ROR2 in the subject.",
                                "Additionally, the methods of detection can be used to monitor the progress of a disorder associated with elevated ROR2. The method includes obtaining a sample from a subject in need of screening, e.g., a subject having been diagnosed or suspected to have a disorder associated with elevated ROR2. The level of ROR2 in the sample is measured using an antibody, antibody-based binding protein, antibody fragment thereof of the invention, and the level in the sample is compared to a control level corresponding to the level or mean level of ROR2 in one or more samples taken from the test subject at one or more prior times. Levels of ROR2 that are significantly elevated or decreased relative to control indicate that the subject's disorder is deteriorating or improving, respectively. The foregoing methods of detection can be used to screen for the presence or to monitor the progress of disorders including, for example, CLL, ALL, mantle cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, and other cancers.",
                                "In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for screening a subject for an altered level of ROR2. Generally, the methods entail administering to the subject an antibody, antibody-based binding protein, antibody fragment thereof of the invention that is conjugated to a label (e.g., a contrast agent), imaging the subject in a manner suitable for detecting the label, and determining whether a region in the subject has an altered density or concentration of label as compared to the background level of label in proximal tissue. Alternatively, the methods include determining whether there is an altered density or concentration of label in a region as compared to the density or concentration of label previously detected in the same region of the subject. Methods of imaging a subject can include x-ray imaging, x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging (e.g., CT angiography (CTA) imaging), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), nuclear medicine, ultrasound (US) imaging, optical imaging, elastography, infrared imaging, microwave imaging, and the like, as appropriate for detecting the label conjugated to the antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the subject has, is suspected to have, or is at risk of developing an ROR2-expressing tumor, such as CLL, ALL, mantle cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, and other cancers, and the method is used to screen for or detect the presence of the tumor. In another embodiment, the method can be used to monitor the size or density of a ROR2-expressing tumor over time, e.g., during a course of treatment.",
                                "The invention thus provides methods for detecting an altered ROR2 level in a subject. The methods involve (a) obtaining a biological sample from the subject, (b) contacting the sample with an anti-ROR2 antibody, antibody-based binding protein, antibody fragment thereof disclosed herein, (c) determining the level of ROR2 in the biological sample, and (d) comparing the level of ROR2 in the biological sample to a control level of ROR2. This allows determination of whether the ROR2 level in the biological sample is altered relative to the control level of ROR2. In these methods, an increased ROR2 level in the subject relative to the control level is indicative of a disease or condition associated with elevated expression of ROR2 in the subject. For example, detection of elevated ROR2 expression can be indicative of the presence of neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or multiple myeloma in the subject.",
                                "In still another aspect, the invention provides methods for detecting a ROR2-expressing tumor in a subject. These methods entail (a) administering an anti-ROR2 antibody, antibody-based binding protein, antibody fragment thereof of the invention to a subject that has, is suspected to have, or is at risk of developing an ROR2-expressing tumor, and (b) imaging the subject for a region of altered conjugated label density or concentration, wherein the density or concentration is relative to (i) background in proximal tissue or (ii) the density or concentration previously detected in the same region of the subject. The existence of a region of altered conjugated label density or concentration is an indication of the presence of a ROR2-expressing tumor in the subject.",

                                "In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating a subject that has, is suspected to have, or is at risk of developing a disorder associated with elevated levels of ROR2 by adoptive transfer of the genetically engineered T-cells described herein, which express an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that selectively binds ROR2. Recombinant technology can be used to introduce CAR-encoding genetic material into any suitable T-cells, e.g., central memory T-cells from the subject to be treated. The T cells carrying the genetic material can be expanded (e.g., in the presence of cytokines). The genetically engineered T-cells are transferred, typically by infusion, to the patient. The transferred T-cells of the invention can then mount an immune response against ROR2 expressing cells in the subject. The adoptive transfer method can be used, for example, to treat subjects that have or are suspected to have any of the cancers associated with ROR2, including CLL, ALL, mantle cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, and other cancers. In some embodiments, the foregoing methods of treatment can further include co-administering a second therapeutic agent for treating the disorder associated with elevated ROR2. For example, when the disorder to be treated involves an ROR2-expressing cancer, the method can further include co-administration of a cytotoxic, cystostatic, or antiangiogenic or immune-stimulatory agent (e.g. immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, for instance, but not limited to, those binding to PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, OX40, TIM3, GITR, LAG3 and the like) suitable for treating the cancer. If the cancer is a B-cell malignancy, the method can further include, for example, co-administration of rituximab, alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, or a CHOP chemotherapeutic regimen.",
                                "The invention thus further provides eukaryotic or non-eukaryotic cells (e.g., T lymphocytes) that have been recombinantly engineered to produce the fully human anti-ROR2 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention. The eukaryotic or non-eukaryotic cells can be used as an expression system to produce the antibody of the invention. In some embodiments, the invention provides ROR2 targeted immune cells that are engineered to recombinantly express a ROR2-specific non-human or humanized antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention. For example, the invention provides a T cell engineered to express a human anti-ROR2 antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention (e.g., an scFv, scFv-Fc, or (scFv)2), which is linked to a synthetic molecule containing one or more of the following domains: a spacer or hinge region (e.g., a CD28 sequence or a IgG4 hinge-Fc sequence), a transmembrane region (e.g., a transmembrane canonical domain), and an intracellular T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling domain, thereby forming a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T-body. Intracellular TCR signaling domains that can be included in a CAR (or T-body) include, but are not limited to, CD3\u03b6, FcR-\u03b3, and Syk-PT signaling domains as well as the CD28, 4-1BB, and CD134 co-signaling domains.
