                        "Certain beam deflector technologies, specifically those associated with particle accelerators, require power supplies. Circuits can be used to modulate such power supplies. For example, certain circuits are used for operating travelling wave kickers which are used in particle accelerators for giving a kick to a selected bunch in a particle beam. Such devices often require the delivery of high voltage waveforms with fast rise/fall time, often to low impedance structures. Different techniques to generate fast high voltage pulses can presently be implemented using commercially available semiconductor devices.",
                        "Recent developments in superconducting accelerator technologies have resulted in the ability to build linear accelerators capable of operating in continuous wave (CW) mode. Therefore, modern beam deflecting devices (among other components of such linear accelerators) that can also operate at CW mode are desirable. For example, the PIP-II Injector test superconducting linear accelerator at FermiLab has operational requirements that include a kicker driver configured to have an absolute worst case 4 ns rise/fall time, 500 V amplitude, ability to switch at about 81.25 MHz in 100 ns bursts and handle average switching rates of more than 30 MHz for the CW operation. There is presently no driver capable of meeting these criteria.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need in the art for high speed drivers for particle beam deflectors as disclosed herein."

Transformer T1 can hold off at least 600 V, deliver more than 2 watts of power to the isolated gate driver circuit 910, and can only present several nano farads of capacitance across the isolation. The capacitance is made low by delivering AC power at, for example, 500 kHz (or other frequency in other embodiments). This is advantageous because it allows the use of a physically small (e.g., an outside diameter of less than an inch, an inside diameter of less than an inch, and a thickness of less than an inch) toroid ferrite core transformer 925. The transformer 925 primary can have as few as two turns, and the secondaries can each have as few as several turns. Minimizing capacitance between each gate driver circuit and ground is necessary for the multi-FET switch assembly to switch completely on and off at the desired timescale (e.g., less than 2 nanoseconds).",

In each optical splitter 1035 and 1036, the signal is divided by the number of channels equal to the number of output FETs comprising the switch.",
                        "Each channel of the optical splitters 1035 and 1036 is connected to an optical delay line that is used to precisely adjust the rising or trailing edge delay.

This reconstructed waveform 1065 then triggers the GaN FET gate 1070. The rising and trailing edges of the GaN FET gate driver signal can be matched between all the FETs in a switch to less than 10 ps. This approach of putting delay adjustment in the fiber elements gives the GaN FET gate driver circuit better noise immunity than using potentiometers and capacitors within the circuit itself, as may be employed in other embodiments.",

Several design features of the circuit in this module are combined to drive the GaN FET (Q3) 905 on and off in a short (i.e., sub-two nanosecond) time frame and at 80 MHz repetition rates.",

The electrical design of the disclosed embodiments does not limit higher, long burst, and average switching rate operation. However, in other embodiments higher switching rates for other applications may require special thermal design to manage the GaN FET power dissipation. In other such embodiments, tens of megahertz average switching rates are possible with liquid cooling.",
                        "The GaN FET gate driver 910 operates as follows. A voltage is applied to the gate of (Q1) 945 to turn it on. Its drain goes low which drives the gates of both (Q2) 950 and GaN FET (Q3) 955 low turning them off. When voltage on the Q1 gate 945 is driven low, its drain rises which raises the voltage on the Q2 gate 950 turning it on. That in turn forces current to flow out of the Q2 source to charge the GaN FET Q3 gate 955 capacitance, turning it on. Diode (D2) 960 is reverse biased when the Q1 drain voltage rises, allowing Q2 950 to turn on by preventing resistor (R2) 965 from being shunted around Q2. Diode (D2) 960 forward biases when Q1 945 turns on and, being a low resistance (forward biased Schottky resistance reduces to a value less than one Ohm, thus a value of about several Ohms is required for resistor (R5) 970 to dampen the voltage ring) allows high current to discharge Q3 955 gate capacitance to turn it off as fast as possible.",
                        "There needs to be resistance in series with the Q2 gate 950 when current flows in both directions; that is, current flows into the gate when turning on, and current flows out of the gate when it turns off. Otherwise deleterious ringing occurs due to circuit parasitics. Resistor (R1) 975 damps ringing when Q2 950 turns on. Although, FET damping is generally provided by placing a resistor directly in series with the gate, in certain embodiments of this circuit, resistor R2 965 not only damps ringing when Q2 950 turns off, but also reduces current through R1 975 when Q1 945 turns on thereby reducing power dissipated in R1 975. Also, R2 965 is small enough (e.g., on the order of 10 Ohms, or other resistances in other embodiments) that voltage across it does not prevent Q2 950 from turning off when it should. It should be noted that the circuit includes resistor (R3) 990 and capacitor (C1) 995.",
                        "Several factors contribute to the novel and power-efficient embodiments of the GaN FET driver circuit and switching speed. One is that Q1 and Q2 are uniquely chosen. Specifically, they are GaN FETs that have very fast switching speed, are physically very small, have low gate to source, and drain to source, capacitance in relation to their drain current rating, and their turn-on threshold voltage is lower than any other type of FET. In certain embodiment, it should be appreciated that it is necessary that the turn on and off transition times of these transistors be one nanosecond or less.",
                        "In certain embodiments, transistors Q1 and Q2 can be approximately 2 millimeters square in size. That allows them to be physically located very close to together and close to the Q3 gate. This minimizes the parasitic inductance along the current path through Q3 gate allowing resistor (R4) 980 and R5 970 resistor values to be low enough to damp voltage ringing and enable the Q3 955 gate to transition on and off fast.",
                        "The low capacitance values of Q1 945 and Q2 950 provides the desired switching speed in several ways. The digital logic IC driving the gate of Q1 945, although having limited output drive current capability, can turn Q1 945 on and off in one nanosecond, because the Q1 945 gate capacitance is low. Also, a novel use of inductor (L1) 985 in series with R1 975 forms a two-pole network in combination with the sum of Q1 945 drain and Q2 950 gate capacitances. This network results in turning on Q2 950 with the speed as if a smaller value of R1 975 was used instead with L1 985 omitted. The resulting larger value of R1 975 reduces its power dissipation by about 30% compared with using a smaller R1 value without L1 985. The values of R1 975 and L1 985 are chosen for the two-pole network to be somewhat underdamped that results in the gate Q2 950 voltage to overshoot positive at turn on. However, because the Q1 945 and Q2 950 capacitances are as low as they are, the network's natural resonant frequency is high enough that the voltage settles back in time to not cause timing shifts if a turn on cycle occurs every 12 nanoseconds. This allows the multi-switch to achieve 80 MHz repetition switching rates (for example).",

These structures can be driven separately, each with its own driver. In an exemplary setup, the bunch length can be approximately 1.3 ns, and the beam can bunched at 6.15 ns intervals. The exemplary setup can kick out a beam on a bunch-by-bunch basis. Thus, the beam deflector and its driver have a rise/fall time of 2 ns and a minimum pulse width of 4 ns. This is necessary to ensure the system can turn on and off completely in between the bunches. Voltages can be generated on and off to kick and pass bunches having pulse widths that can be from 4 ns to essentially DC. Any arbitrary pulse pattern can be generated and therefore any beam structure can be achieved.",

The H-beam can have an exemplary energy of 30 keV (or other desired energy) as it enters the radio frequency quadrupole 1210 (RFQ). While travelling through the RFQ 1210, the beam is grouped into (for example) a 162.5 MHz bunch structure and accelerated to an energy of 2.1 MeV. Then the bunched beam enters the beam deflector 1215, where only the desired bunches of the beam are deflected off the central axis. In the beam deflector 1215, the beam separates into two beams: the deflected beam and passed beam. While travelling downstream, the deflected beam is stopped with the beam scraper 1220 which can be moved into the beamline such that it scrapes the deflected beam bunches, terminating their transmission but does nothing to the passed beam. The passed beam therefore goes further, enters the wall current monitor 1225, and then is absorbed in the beam absorber 1230. The wall current monitor 1225 allows observation and measurement of the beam time structure.",
