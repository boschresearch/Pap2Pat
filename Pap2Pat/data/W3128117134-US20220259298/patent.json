                        "In the majority of patients, acquired diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease result in tooth agenesis (patients with loss of teeth). As high as 1% incidence rate of congenital tooth agenesis is also reported. Currently, the only treatment method for missing teeth is prosthetic treatment which includes dental implants and dentures, and there is no fundamental treatment method. Numerous studies of tooth regeneration using tissue engineering approaches have been reported. Various cells such as stem cells (Non-Patent Literature 1) are used as cell sources. In addition, in order to allow teeth made in vitro to function in the oral cavity, an \u201corgan primordium method\u201d (Non-Patent Literature 2), a cell manipulation technology for regenerating a dental organ primordium (the rudiment of the organ) in a collagen gel, has been reported. However, owing to cost and safety problems for securing cell sources, tissue engineering approaches have not reached clinical application.",
                        "A large number of causative genes for congenital tooth agenesis have been identified, and many of them are common to both human and mouse. For example, RUNX2, MSX1, EDA, WNT10A, PAX9, AXIN2 etc. are known. Among the listed genes, WNT10A gene has been reported to cause congenital tooth agenesis in the largest number of patients. EDA gene is a causative gene for anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which is a representative disease of syndromic congenital tooth agenesis. Congenital tooth agenesis is caused by tooth development stopped prematurely due to defect in the causative gene and suppression of the function of the causative gene."

                        "USAG-1 (Uterine Sensitization Associated Gene-1) is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and a Wnt antagonist, and is also called Sostdc-1, Ectodin, or Wise. It is known that in USAG-1 deficient model mice, an increase in BMP signaling is observed, leading to the formation of supernumerary teeth. The present inventors crossed a Runx2-deficient mouse, which is a model mouse for congenital tooth agenesis, with a USAG-1 gene-deficient mouse, which is a model mouse for supernumerary teeth (teeth exceeding the normal number of teeth), to produce a double-knockout mouse. As a result of analysis of the double-knockout mouse, it was found that tooth formation was recovered. Thus it was suggested that inhibition of USAG-1 could treat tooth agenesis.",
                        "This time, the present inventors crossed congenital tooth agenesis model mice lacking causative genes Msx1, Eda and Wnt10a other than Runx2 with an USAG-1 gene-deficient mouse that was newly created by CRISPER-CAS9 system as a model mouse for supernumerary teeth, to produce double-knockout mice. As a result of analysis of the double-knockout mice, it was found that tooth formation was recovered in all the tooth agenesis model mice. Thus it was shown that the treatment by inhibition of USAG-1 can be applied to patients with congenital tooth agenesis caused by various gene mutations.",
                        "Then, in the present invention, a human USAG-1 recombinant protein whose activity was confirmed was used as an antigen to produce antibodies. Thus antibodies that specifically bind to USAG-1 were obtained. These antibodies were found to increase BMP signaling and/or Wnt signaling.",
                        "Therefore, an aspect of the present invention provides an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to and neutralizes USAG-1, that is, an anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibody and an antigen-binding fragment thereof. As used herein unless otherwise specified, USAG-1 means mammalian USAG-1. Examples of the mammal include, but not limited to, a human, a dog, a cat, a horse, a mouse, a ferret, a suncus, a pig, and a monkey, and a human is preferable.",
                        "As used herein, neutralizing refers to inhibiting the function of USAG-1. The functions of USAG-1 include, for example, BMP signaling inhibitory activity (also referred to as \u201cBMP antagonist activity\u201d) and Wnt signaling inhibitory activity (also referred to as \u201cWnt antagonist activity\u201d). The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure inhibits the BMP signaling inhibitory activity and/or the Wnt signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1. Therefore, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure neutralizes either or both of the BMP signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1 and the Wnt signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1. For example, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure includes, but not limited to, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to USAG-1 and neutralizes the BMP signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1 and does not neutralize the Wnt signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1, and an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to USAG-1 to neutralize the Wnt signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1 and does not neutralize the BMP signaling inhibitory activity of USAG-1. As used herein, \u201cinhibition\u201d includes suppression and reduction.",
                        "The neutralizing activity of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment may be determined by a conventional method. The activity of neutralizing the BMP antagonist activity of USAG-1 (also referred to as \u201cBMP antagonist neutralizing activity\u201d) can be measured in vitro by, for example, an ALP (alkaline phosphatase) assay or a reporter assay. In the ALP assay, for example, osteoblast progenitor cells and the like are cultured in the presence of BMP with addition of USAG-1 protein and an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, and ALP generated when differentiation into osteoblasts is induced is measured. The activity of neutralizing the Wnt antagonist activity of USAG-1 (also referred to as \u201cWnt antagonist neutralizing activity\u201d) can be determined in vitro, for example, by a reporter assay. In the reporter assay, for example, a vector containing a promoter region that reacts with BMP or Wnt, ligated to a reporter gene such as luciferase is introduced into a cell, the cell is cultured in the presence of BMP or Wnt with addition of USAG-1 protein and an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, and expressed luciferase activity is measured. The BMP antagonist activity to be neutralized by the anti-USAG-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure may be an antagonist activity against any BMP family. For example, the anti-USAG-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure may neutralize the antagonist activity against BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, etc. The Wnt antagonist activity to be neutralized by the anti-USAG-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure may be an antagonist activity against any Wnt family. For example, the anti-USAG-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure may neutralize the antagonist activity against Wnt-1, Wnt-3, etc.",
                        "Furthermore, in the present invention, five of the obtained antibodies, namely antibody A, antibody B, antibody C, antibody D and antibody E were sequenced and analyzed.

In epitope binning, for example, an antigen protein (target) is added to a biosensor on which a reference antibody is immobilized to allow the reference antibody to bind the target, the biosensor holding a complex of the reference antibody and the target is reacted with a test antibody, and then, binding of the test antibody to the biosensor (i.e., binding of the test antibody to the target captured by the reference antibody immobilized on the biosensor) and dissociation of the binding are analyzed. If the test antibody shares the same epitope with the reference antibody, the test antibody cannot bind to the biosensor because the epitope on the target is already occupied by the binding of the reference antibody. Conversely, if the test antibody recognizes a different epitope from that recognized by the reference antibody, the test antibody can bind to the biosensor. Furthermore, if the test antibody recognizes a region sterically close to an epitope recognized by the reference antibody, the test antibody cannot bind to the biosensor because the binding of the reference antibody to the target interferes with the binding of the test antibody to the epitope. Thus, use of epitope binning enables to determine whether two or more antibody clones compete for binding to a target protein.",

In a Wnt reporter assay using HEK293 cells, the Wnt inhibitory activity of the Escherichia coli expression system-derived human USAG-1 protein was confirmed (FIG. 1). In an ALP assay with addition of BMP7 using C2C12 cells, the BMP inhibitory activity of the Escherichia coli expression system-derived human USAG-1 protein was confirmed (FIG. 2). For preparation of mouse USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies, three lines of supernumerary tooth model mice, USAG-1KO mice (#116, #118, #138) were newly established using CRISPR-CAS9 (FIG. 3). The neutralizing antibodies were prepared using USAG-1 KO (#116) mice by an iliac lymph node method in ITM Co., Ltd.",
                                "Primary screening of 284 wells was performed by ELISA using the immunizing antigen, and a large number of positive wells were found (FIG. 4-1 and FIG. 4-2). Based on a cutoff value of 0.7, 79 clones were selected. After expansion, ELISA was performed using the immunizing antigen and a mouse USAG-1 protein derived from a CHO cell expression system that was prepared by Sysmex Corporation. When a cut-off value of absorbance was set to 0.025 or more, positive wells were found in about half of the clones (FIG. 4-1 and FIG. 4-2). As a result of measurement of antibody subclasses, they were found to be IgG1, 2a, 2b, and 2c (FIG. 4-1 and FIG. 4-2).",
                                "The neutralizing activity of each antibody was confirmed as follows. In an experimental system in which an ALP activity in C2C12 cells increased by addition of 300 ng/ml of BMP7 (manufactured by R & D systems) was suppressed by addition of 300 ng/ml of a mammalian cell expression system-derived rat USAG-1 protein (manufactured by MyBiosource), each antibody was added to confirm neutralization of the suppressed ALP activity. The antibodies were classified into a group of those having mild neutralizing activity (*: 60-100% neutralizing activity), a group of those having moderate neutralizing activity (**: 100-140% neutralizing activity), and a group of those having high neutralizing activity (***: 140% or more neutralizing activity). For a BMP reporter assay, a commercially available cell line incorporating BRE-Luc, BMP Responsive Reporter Osteoblast Cell Line (Briter cell) (manufactured by Kerafast, Inc.) was used. In an experimental system in which a luciferase activity expressed by addition of 300 ng/ml of BMP7 was suppressed by addition of 300 ng/ml of the mammalian cell expression system-derived rat USAG-1 protein, each antibody was added to confirm neutralization of the suppressed luciferase activity. The antibodies were classified into a group of those having mild neutralizing activity (*: 40-60% neutralizing activity) and a group of those having moderate neutralizing activity (**: 60% or more neutralizing activity). For the WNT reporter assay, an expression plasmid for expressing a TOP-Flash reporter gene having a DNA sequence to bind transcription factor TCF that activates downstream of the WNT signaling, a WNT1 gene, and a reporter gene under the control of an HSV-thymidine kinase promoter for obtaining an internal standard value was introduced into HEK293 cells, and the cells were cultured with addition of the mammalian cell expression system-derived rat USAG-1 protein at a concentration (EC50) for producing 50% of the maximum inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling. An addition amount of the USAG-1 protein was determined in advance. A culture supernatant of an antibody-producing hybridoma was added to the cells so as to be 25%, 20% or 10% in a medium for screening. The experiment was performed three times for evaluation. When added at 25%, the antibodies were classified into a group of those having mild neutralizing activity (*: a luminescence correction value of 1.5-2.0) and a group of those having moderate neutralizing activity (**: a luminescence correction value of 2.0 or more). When added at 20%, the antibodies were classified into a group of those having mild neutralizing activity (*: a luminescence correction value of 1-1.1) and a group of those having moderate neutralizing activity (**: a luminescence correction value of 1.1 or more). When added at 10%, the antibodies were classified into a group of those having mild neutralizing activity (*: a luminescence correction value of 1-1.1) and a group of those having moderate neutralizing activity (**: a luminescence correction value of 1.1 or more). The % of neutralizing activity was calculated based on the activity (100%) under the condition of no addition of USAG-1 protein. Neutralizing activity based on the luminescence value was calculated as a value relative to the activity (1) when no antibody was added.",
                                "As measured by the WNT and BMP reporter assays and the BMP7 ALP assay, there were three types of neutralizing antibodies: antibodies that activate either BMP or WNT signaling, and antibodies that simultaneously activate both BMP and WNT signaling. Six antibodies were selected based on the measurement results of neutralizing activity (FIG. 4-1 and FIG. 4-2). The activity of one clone disappeared during expansion and purification processes. Finally, 5 kinds of mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies (E12, E16, E37, E48, E57) were obtained.",

The purified PA-mUSAG-1 (WISE) protein was shown to have a molecular weight of about 28 kDa, which is close to the theoretical value (24 kDa), by electrophoresis under reduction (R) and non-reduction (NR). The N-terminal PA-tagged mouse USAG-1 (WISE) protein derived from the mammalian cell Expi293F cell expression system showed dose-dependent WNT signaling inhibitory activity in the WNT reporter assay (FIG. 6) and dose-dependent BMP signaling inhibitory activity in the BMP ALP assay (FIG. 7). The mouse USAG-1 protein whose activity was confirmed was used to confirm the neutralizing activity of 5 mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies (E12, E16, E37, E48, E57).

The neutralizing antibodies were prepared by the iliac lymph node method using USAG-1 KO (#116) mice. The baculovirus expression system-derived rat USAG-1 protein was shown to have BMP inhibitory activity and Wnt inhibitory activity in the same manner as described in Example 1. Primary screening of the obtained antibody clones was performed by ELISA using the immunizing antigen (the baculovirus expression system-derived rat USAG-1 protein) and the Escherichia coli expression system-derived human USAG-1 protein, and a large number of positive wells were found. Based on a cut-off value of 1.0, 111 clones were selected. After expansion, the clones were subjected to sandwich ELISA using the immunizing antigen. When a cut-off value of absorbance was set to 0.5 or more (His tag) or 1.4 or more (Myc tag), positive wells were found in about half of the clones. As a result of measurement of antibody subclasses, they were found to be IgG1, 2a, 2b, and G3. Further, the neutralizing activity of the obtained antibodies was measured in the same manner as described in Example 1. Finally, four types of mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies (B14, B48, B103, B108) were obtained.",
                                "Further, in the same manner as in Example 6, a binding assay was performed using moue/human N-terminal PA-tagged USAG-1 proteins to confirm that the obtained mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies (B14, B48, B103, B108) recognize the human USAG-1 protein. Each of the mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies [5 \u03bcg in 250 \u03bcl protein A/G IgG binding buffer (Pierce\u2122)+250 \u03bcl PBS] was captured on Protein A sepharose (30 \u03bcl) (room temperature, 1.5 hours). A culture supernatant (0.75 mL) of Expi293F cells transiently expressing a human or mouse N-terminal PA-tagged USAG-1 (WISE) recombinant protein was added to the Protein A sepharose, and then incubated (room temperature, 2 hours). Washing with a PBS buffer was performed 3 times to remove unbound proteins. All proteins bound to the sepharose were eluted, and bands were detected by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and CBB (Coomassie Brilliant Blue) staining. As a result, all of the tested mouse anti-USAG-1 neutralizing antibodies bound to both the mouse USAG-1 and the human USAG-1 protein (FIG. 15), though the binding of B103 and B108 was weaker than that of B14 and B48.",

FIG. 16 shows comparison of 6 types of antibodies among the obtained competitive binding data. Epitope binning was performed using Octet (registered trademark) Red (manufactured by Pall ForteBio). Briefly, each of the nine antibodies was immobilized on a biosensor as a capture antibody, a target comprising a purified full-length recombinant mouse USAG-1 was added to bind the capture antibody, and then the biosensor was reacted with a test antibody to detect a binding signal. This cycle was repeated in succession using 9 test antibodies including the same antibody as used for capture. An antibody that does not compete with the capture antibody immobilized on the biosensor for the recognition site can bind to the captured USAG-1 protein, and thus the signal increases. In contrast, a competing antibody weakly binds to the captured USAG-1 protein, and thus no increase or little increase in the signal was observed. Based on the signal data obtained, the 9 antibodies were grouped based on their epitopes. Specifically, in a reaction of a test antibody with the sensor immobilizing any of the nine capture antibodies, when the reaction generated a signal equal to or weaker than a signal (indicated by a bold underline in FIG. 16) generated when the same antibody as the capture antibody was added, the test antibody was regarded as belonging to the same group as the capture antibody. As a result, E37 and E48 competed with the E12 antibody, E48, E57 and B14 competed with the E16 antibody, E12 competed with the E37 antibody, E16, E57 and B14 competed with the E48 antibody, E16, E48 and B14 competed with the E57 antibody, E16, E48 and E57 competed with the B14 antibody, and B108 competed with the B103 antibody. Based on these results, the 9 kinds of antibodies were classified into 4 groups as shown in Table 1. However, the E48 antibody was also close to group 1 because it competes with E12, though the E48 antibody was basically classified into group 2."

In born offspring mice, the presence of supernumerary teeth and fused teeth and the presence or absence of recovery of missing teeth were examined. Results are shown in Table 6. Of the antibodies in groups 3 and 4, B48 and B103 induced the formation of supernumerary teeth and fused teeth in the homozygous deficient mice."
