    "title": "Genetic deconvolution of fetal and maternal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma enables next-generation non-invasive prenatal screening",
    "date": "2022-10-13",
    "abstract": "Current non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) analyzes circulating fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal peripheral blood for selected aneuploidies or microdeletion/duplication syndromes. Many genetic disorders are refractory to NIPS largely because the maternal genetic material constitutes most of the total cfDNA present in the maternal plasma, which hinders the detection of fetus-specific genetic variants. Here, we developed an innovative sequencing method, termed co ordinative a llele-aware t arget e nrichment seq uencing (COATE-seq), followed by multidimensional genomic analyses of sequencing read depth, allelic fraction, and linked single nucleotide polymorphisms, to accurately separate the fetal genome from the maternal background. Analytical confounders including multiple gestations, maternal copy number variations, and absence of heterozygosity were successfully recognized and precluded for fetal variant analyses. In addition, fetus-specific genomic characteristics, including the cfDNA fragment length, meiotic error origins, meiotic recombination, and recombination breakpoints were identified which reinforced the fetal variant assessment. In 1129 qualified pregnancies tested, 54 fetal aneuploidies, 8 microdeletions/microduplications, and 8 monogenic variants were detected with 100% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. Using the comprehensive cfDNA genomic analysis tools developed, we found that 60.3% of aneuploidy samples had aberrant meiotic recombination providing important insights into the mechanism underlying meiotic nondisjunctions. Altogether, we show that the genetic deconvolution of the fetal and maternal cfDNA enables thorough and accurate delineation of fetal genome which paves the way for the next-generation prenatal screening of essentially all types of human genetic disorders.",

                "Human birth defects occur in ~3%\u20135% of liveborns1. It has been estimated that 15%\u201325% of birth defects were attributed to recognizable genetic diseases2. There are over 8600 diseases with a known or suspected underlying genetic etiology, most of which have no effective treatments3. To provide management options for pregnancies at risk of life-threatening genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and cystic fibrosis, population-based genetic screening has been carried out since the 1970s with proven clinical utility4. In the past decade, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) was developed and implemented worldwide to screen for common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21 (T21, also known as Down syndrome)5. Recently, NIPS has expanded to cover chromosomal microdeletion and microduplication syndromes (MMS) such as DiGeorge syndrome6. Studies have also demonstrated that fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is useful for the diagnosis or screening of common monogenic conditions such as achondroplasia and Noonan spectrum disorders7,8. However, a comprehensive NIPS test for concurrent screening of chromosomal and monogenic disorders has yet to be developed and implemented to battle the large catalog of genetic birth defects.",
                "NIPS utilizes a simple draw of maternal blood containing both maternal and fetal circulating cfDNA5. Fetal cfDNA is believed to be derived from the apoptotic cells of the outer layer of placental trophoblast, which then enters maternal circulation9. The fetal cfDNA accounts for only a small proportion of the total cfDNA in maternal plasma which is estimated only ~10% on average during the 2nd trimester and even lower during late 1st trimester when NIPS is offered clinically10. At such a low level, the fetal variants can only be recognized when any detectable difference introduced by the fetal genetic abnormality (signal) exceeds that associated with assay variations (noise). In previous studies, up to ~11,000\u201320,000 loci were used in NIPS to detect common aneuploidies11,12. Apparently, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based NIPS can be improved by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio so that far fewer SNP loci need to be interrogated. Besides the analytical challenge of detecting low-level fetal variants in the maternal and fetal cfDNA admixture, accurate NIPS results are often obscured by multiple gestations, maternal germline copy number variations (CNVs), absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and other analytical challenges13\u201315. In twin pregnancies, the individual cfDNA contributed by each fetus is usually lower than that of a singleton fetus affected with an aneuploidy which exacerbates the NIPS assay sensitivity16. In addition, ultrasound may not accurately identify twin zygosity or vanishing twins which can cause increased health risks for the fetus(es). Maternal CNVs such as non-pathogenic duplications cause a significant number of false-positive fetal trisomies detected by NIPS17. Maternal AOH reduces the number of the interpretable heterozygous loci for the detection of fetal chromosomal copy number abnormalities in NIPS assays depending on genotype information18. These confounders, if not properly recognized, lead to false screening results, which in turn may result in missed diagnoses or unnecessary invasive procedures for diagnostic confirmation.",
                "Currently, there are two prevailing NIPS approaches that involve low-coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS) or targeted sequencing for SNPs to infer fetal chromosome copy number5,11. WGS-based NIPS utilizes chromosome-specific read depth (RD) data to identify fetal chromosomal aberrations based on a Z-score calculation5. SNP-based NIPS detects chromosomal aberrations at selected loci by the quantitation of skewed allelic fraction (AF) caused by CNVs19. These two methods have distinct strengths and limitations for the analyses of fetal cfDNA. For instance, SNP-based NIPS is limited in detecting fetal copy number changes at regions with maternal AOH18,19. The low-coverage WGS method is constrained due to its inability to discriminate maternal and fetal genotypes, which limits its clinical utility for the detection of hydatidiform moles or unrecognized twin or vanishing twin pregnancies13. The combined use of RD and AF for high-coverage NIPS has been proposed from a simulation dataset, but the clinical validity of this approach needs to be substantiated by larger studies20.",
                "Besides the RD and AF data mentioned above, the cfDNA fragmentation pattern can also be informative for the detection of fetal variants in NIPS. The size of fetal cfDNA fragment is usually shorter than the maternal counterpart21,22. The assay sensitivity can be improved by sampling shorter cfDNA fragments from the maternal plasma when a higher percentage of fetal cfDNA molecules are recovered in the NIPS test23,24. Human aneuploidies were reported to be associated with aberrant maternal meiotic recombination presenting with an erratic number of crossovers and unusual chromosome breakpoints25\u201327. Therefore, the discovery of chromosome recombinants would serve as additional evidence for the detection of aneuploidies in NIPS. However, aberrant meiotic crossovers associated with human aneuploidies have not been reported in cfDNA likely due to current assay limitations. Overall, the recognition of fetus-specific cfDNA characteristics including its fragment length or meiotic crossovers can improve the performance of NIPS as additional information is utilized to discriminate the fetal variants from the maternal background.",
                "In this study, we present a new NIPS approach employing non-biased allelic target enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the comprehensive analyses of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, MMS, and monogenic disorders. This approach uses deep sequencing to analyze genomic regions associated with three distinct types of genetic disorders with test resolution from single base variant to whole chromosome copy number change. In addition, this method genetically deconvolutes the fetal and maternal cfDNA admixture by querying NGS data associated with maternal/fetal genotype, RD, SNP linkage, and cfDNA fragment lengths. With the concerted analysis of multidimensional genomic cues, this new NIPS assay yielded much improved analytical performance and addressed the limitations of current methods caused by multiple assay confounders. Furthermore, we discovered meiotic errors associated with aberrant chromosome recombinants from the cfDNA studies providing important insights into the origins of human aneuploidies."

                        "The fetal fraction (FF) is ~10% on average during the 2nd trimester and even lower during late 1st trimester present in maternal plasma10. The variation of SNP AF caused by fetal chromosomal copy number abnormality is subtle and only detectable when it exceeds that caused by assay artifacts. In conventional liquid-phase hybridization for target enrichment, oligonucleotide probes are designed to perfectly match reference sequences (Fig. 1a). When the number of complementary base pairs is increased, the total gain in free Gibbs energy-related duplex formation rises28. Therefore, DNA fragments harboring the reference allele (wild-type allele) have a higher pairing affinity to probes than those with the alternative allele (variant allele; Fig. 1a, b). This small but significant allelic bias disfavoring the alternative allele confounds the NIPS assay for the detection of low-level fetal chromosome CNV. We found that the average AF at the maternal heterozygous loci was always lower than 0.5, indicating that fewer DNA fragments with variant alleles were recovered than those with the wild-type alleles (Fig. 1c, d; Materials and methods). To reduce such allelic biases, probes were designed for SNPs on different chromosomes associated with the most common human aneuploidies or MMS (see Materials and methods), which have a minimal difference of the hybridization equilibrium constants for the reference and alternative alleles (\u0394K\u2009=\u2009K\u2013 K\u2019\u2009\u2248\u20090; Fig. 1b). Noteworthily, the sequences of these probes may not be perfectly complementary to either the reference or alternative alleles (Fig. 1b; Materials and methods). This new target enrichment strategy for NGS was named coordinative allele-aware target enrichment sequencing (COATE-seq). We found that the COATE-seq yielded less allelic bias for hybridization-based target enrichment than sequencing performed with conventional probes (CON-seq; Fig. 1c\u2013e). The median of the AF across all maternal heterozygous loci, was significantly elevated and closer to 0.5 when COATE-seq was performed (Fig. 1c, d). In addition, the AF coefficient of variation (CV) of fetal variants was also significantly reduced in COATE-seq (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. S1). To evaluate whether COATE-seq was indeed beneficial for fetal SNP AF quantification, the FF determined by the AF values of all informative SNP loci was compared to that calculated by the Y chromosome-based method. The COATE-seq yielded a higher correlation of coefficient (R2\u2009=\u20090.97) for the SNP-based method than that of CON-seq (R2\u2009=\u20090.91; Fig. 1f, g). Consistently, we found that the COATE-seq yielded a smaller bias for the FF estimation when using the fetal heterozygous SNPs at loci where the mother was homozygous for the reference or alternative allele (Supplementary Fig. S2). Overall, the above results demonstrate that COATE-seq produces more accurate quatification for fetal SNP AF than the conventional enrichment method which is critical to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the NIPS assay for the detection of chromosomal aberrations.Fig. 1COATE-seq suppresses allelic hybridization bias.a Enrichment of targeted genomic region by liquid-phase hybridization. Probe and target strand pairing is a reversible process, characterized by an equilibrium constant. The equilibrium constant for a probe complementary to the target sequence (K) is larger than that for its target sequence with a variant (K\u2019). b Unlike conventional (CON) probes, COATE probes do not discriminate reference and alternative alleles, and thus the difference between KCOATE and KCOATE\u2019 is smaller than that of KCON and KCON\u2019. Two representative DNA fragments with different hybridization equilibrium constants were shown for conventional and COATE probes. c The CAF (central allelic fraction) in maternal heterozygous loci of 12 pregnant women\u2019s plasma samples was significantly higher and closer to 0.5 when the COATE probes were used at hybridization temperature of 65 \u00b0C. The experiment was repeated three times. d The reduction in hybridization allelic bias was also significant at hybridization temperature of 68\u2009\u00b0C using eight pregnant women\u2019s plasma samples. The experiment was repeated three times. e The CV of AFs was compared between COATE-seq and CON-seq (enrichment performed by COATE and conventional probes, respectively) at hybridization temperature of 65 \u00b0C. The ratios were shown for the CV using COATE-seq and CON-seq at loci where the mother was homozygous for the reference allele (BB), homozygous for the alternative alleles (AA), and heterozygous (AB). Paired t-test was used in c\u2013e for the comparisons; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001, and ****P\u2009<\u20090.0001. f, g The comparison of the FF calculation using the COATE-seq and CON-seq methods.

                        "While COATE-seq improves fetal variant genotyping accuracy, multiple gestations, maternal CNV, and AOH can confound the detection of abnormal fetal variant intermixed in the total maternal plasma cfDNA. Such obstacles can be overcome when the fetal and maternal genetic profiles are separated at large. To this end, we developed algorithms for concurrent analyses of chromosome dosage and genotype by surveying both the RD and AF data as opposed to conventional NIPS tests depending on either RD or AF data only (Fig. 2a\u2013i). Using this joint analysis, dizygotic twin pregnancies and maternal CNV and AOH can be detected prior to fetal variant calling as a quality control step to reduce analytical errors (Fig. 2a). In 419 samples used for analytical validation, there were 17 (4.1%) with maternal CNV with a size of \u2265\u2009200\u2009kb (Fig. 3a\u2013c), 10 (2.4%) with maternal AOH regions with \u2265 75 consecutive homozygous loci (Fig. 3d\u2013f), and 10 (2.4%) with multiple gestations or non-maternity (Fig. 3g, h). After accounting for confounders including \u2265\u20093\u2009Mb maternal CNV, maternal chromosomal AOH diminishing heterozygous SNP loci, and non-singleton pregnancy, the RD-based analysis identified all aneuploidies but one T18 resulting in a test sensitivity at 97.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 87.1%\u201399.6%) and a positive predictive value (PPV) at 84.8% (95% CI, 70.5%\u201393.2%) (Fig. 2h, i; Supplementary Fig. S3). The AF-based method detected 34 out of 40 aneuploidies producing an 85.0% (95% CI, 70.9%\u201392.9%) sensitivity and a 91.9% (95% CI, 76.9%\u201397.9%) PPV (Fig. 2h, i). The combined RD and AF approach detected all aneuploidies with a 100% (95% CI, 91.2%\u2013100%) sensitivity and an 80.0% (95% CI, 65.9%\u201389.5%) PPV (Fig. 2h, i). These results demonstrated that the combined use of RD and AF data had a higher test sensitivity than either method used alone. Importantly, the AF-based method is useful to calculate FF and recognize multiple gestations and maternal AOH (Figs. 2a, 3d\u2013g). In addition, the AF-based method is highly sensitive for the detection of fetal chromosomal aberrations derived from paternal meiotic errors (Fig. 2c, e, g). Another added advantage of the AF-based method is the ability to detect the parental and meiotic origin of fetal chromosomal aberrations (Fig. 2b\u2013g; Supplementary Fig. S4a\u2013c). On the other hand, RD analysis complements the AF analysis for cases in which the number of informative loci for the detection of CNV is reduced (Supplementary Fig. S4d).Fig. 2Combined SNP allelic ratio and RD analysis detects fetal chromosomal aberrations.a Detection of fetal chromosomal disorders involves a combined analysis of SNP AF and RD. Lv1 QC includes monitoring of sufficient RD, FF, multiple gestations, and maternal CNV. Samples passing Lv1 QC are subjected to the RD-based chromosomal analysis. Lv2 QC includes the detection of maternal AOH and calculation of the number of informative loci where the fetus carries a heterozygous allele, and the mother is homozygous.

                        "It is known that maternal age is an important risk factor for common aneuploidies, e.g., T21, T18, and T1329. These aneuploidies are mostly of maternal origin and associated with aberrant meiotic recombination25\u201327. However, evidence for the interplay between meiotic crossovers and human aneuploidies is scarce likely due to the difficulty of collecting a large number of human eggs or invasively collected prenatal specimens. Given these challenges, the NIPS approach would seem to be an ideal alternative. We then examined whether recombinants associated with aneuploidies could be detected using our COATE-seq method, which had improved analytical performance over conventional approaches (Supplementary Figs. S5, S6; Materials and methods). In 33 sets of samples consisting of matched fetal, maternal DNA, and their admixtures, we identified the chromosome recombinants in mixed DNA and confirmed the recombinants in the fetal genome based on linked SNPs (Fig. 4a\u2013c; Materials and methods). Similarly, the homologous chromosome recombinants can be detected using the same method for the plasma cfDNA samples from pregnant women and their respective amniocytes (Fig. 4d\u2013f; Supplementary Fig. S7). In 73 aneuploidy samples tested in this study, 47 T21 (63.8%) cases had maternal meiosis I (MI) NDJ, with the remaining in maternal meiosis II (MII) NDJ (27.7%), paternal meiosis I (PI) NDJ (2.1%), and paternal meiosis II (PII) NDJ (6.4%), respectively (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Table S1). While MI NDJ (50.0%) was more frequent than other meiotic errors in T13 as seen in T21, MII NDJ (57.1%) was the most frequent one in T18 (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Table S1). Among these samples, 44/73 (60.3%; 25 T21, 9 T18, and 10 T13) with recombinants were detected (Fig. 4h; Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S8). In the validation set, 34/40 (85.0%) aneuploidies were identified by the AF method when recombination was considered (Fig. 2h), but the detection rate dropped to 67.5% if crossovers were disregarded. Next, we characterized the crossovers associated with the origins of meiotic errors. Altogether, we found that T21 cases with detectable recombinants had more with a single crossover in MI, while in T18 and T13, more cases had two or more crossovers (Supplementary Table S1). The distribution of meiotic errors and crossovers identified in this cohort was consistent with previous reports (Fig. 4h, i)25\u201327. For instance, in T21 due to maternal NDJ with a single crossover, most MI cases had breakpoints near the telomeric region, while breakpoints near the centromeric region were more frequent in MII cases (Supplementary Fig. S9). Again, these results were consistent with previous studies characterizing the occurrence of meiotic recombination in T21 using invasive fetal samples30. Overall, these data demonstrated that our NIPS method was highly accurate in characterizing the origin of meiotic errors and crossovers in common aneuploidies.Fig. 4The fetal cfDNA study reveals parental and meiotic origin of NDJ and homologous recombination associated with aneuploidy.a\u2013c A T21 case using matched maternal and fetal mixed DNA, which shows homologous recombination. The occurrence of recombinant could be inferred from the presence of two different AF patterns consistent with MI and MII NDJs (a). In the respective amniocytes, homozygous SNPs (BBB or AAA) are detected only in the telomeric but not centromeric region of chr21 consistent with the presence of recombinant (b). At loci where the mother is heterozygous, fetal homozygosity (AAA or BBB) is consistent with MII NDJ. The probability of meiotic errors for each informative locus is plotted (c). When fetal genotype is heterozygous (ABB or AAB), the prior probability for the detectable MI NDJ is 2/3 while that for MII NDJ is 1/3 assuming an equal incidence in MI and MII NDJs. The dashed lines indicate the transition of MI and MII SNP patterns suggesting a crossover. d\u2013f The cfDNA collected from a pregnant woman carrying a T13 fetus shows the recombinant with the respective fetal genomic DNA SNP pattern (e) and probability of meiotic errors (f). The dashed lines show where transition of MI and MII SNP patterns occurs indicating two crossover events. g Percentages of different types of meiotic errors detected. h Percentages of aneuploidy cases with and without detectable recombinants. i The number of crossovers associated with different types of meiosis NDJ.

                        "Unlike fetal chromosomal aberrations involving multiple loci in targeted regions, it requires higher analytical resolution to detect fetal monogenic variants associated with discrete loci. To this end, a new multidimensional algorithm was developed to identify de novo or paternally inherited fetal single gene variants (Fig. 5a, b). The detection of fetal single nucleotide variants (SNVs) can be considered as a process of sampling a population of mixed fetal and maternal DNA molecules. Then the likelihood for an SNV being of fetal origin can be calculated using a beta-binomial distribution based on the number of total DNA molecules detected, FF, and the alternative (alt) allele counts (Materials and methods). We named the filtering step depending on the number of variant allele reads Allele Count Distribution (ACD) filtering (Fig. 5a; Materials and methods). We also found that the fetal cfDNA fragments were ~10\u2009bp on average shorter than the maternal counterpart, while the fragments harboring false positive variants were similar in length to the maternal fragments (Fig. 5c; Supplementary Fig. S10). Fetal-Maternal Insert-size Distribution (FMID) filtering was then established based on the difference of fetal and maternal cfDNA fragment length to discern fetal variants (Fig. 5b). In FMID filtering, a fetal-maternal nearest neighbor insert-size calibration was performed for each NGS read harboring an alt allele at loci where the mother was homozygous for the reference (ref) allele. A binary search was then used to exclude the ref allele read with the closest fragment length to an alt allele read (Fig. 5b). After multiple iterations for all the alt allele reads, the surviving ref allele reads could be regarded maternal. The insert sizes of the remaining reads were then tested under different hypotheses followed by a median comparison to examine whether the alt allele fragments were indeed statistically different or shorter than the ref allele fragments in length (Fig. 5a; Materials and methods). Using the above multidimensional analysis, we examined 28 plasma cfDNA samples and their respective amniocytes collected from pregnant women for 463 genes associated with monogenic disorders. In this test validation set, both common SNPs and rare sequence variants were analyzed (Supplementary Table S2). When the ACD and FMID filters were both applied, the analytical sensitivity and specificity were 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, improved from the no-filter or ACD filter only method (Fig. 5d, e; Supplementary Table S2). Noteworthily, the ACD and FMID filters were deployed sequentially to filter in variants to avoid over-filtering when variants surviving any of the filtering steps were deemed positive (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Table S3). In summary, by integrating both the allele count and cfDNA fragment length information, we established a new and highly accurate fetal SNV detection method to detect monogenic disorders caused by de novo and paternally inherited sequence variants.Fig. 5The use of cfDNA characteristics for the detection of fetal monogenic variants.a The identification of fetal monogenic variants includes ROI analysis, ACD filtering, and FMID filtering. b Fetal-Maternal Nearest Neighbor Insert-size Calibration was first used to exclude those reads harboring wild-type alleles which possess the closest cfDNA fragment length to the reads harboring the variant alleles of a potential fetal origin. The remaining fragments with the wild-type allele were compared with those with the variant alleles for their lengths to identify potential fetal SNVs. c Different insert-size distribution for wild-type (ref) and variant (alt) allele supporting reads on 28 samples tested. For all variants detected, median insert-size of ref (RefinsMid) and alt (AltinsMid) allele supporting reads were box plotted with upper whisker (Q3\u2009+\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR), Q3, Q2, average, Q1, and lower whisker (Q1\u2009\u2013\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR) to demonstrate the differences between the TP or FP variants. Insert-size was ~10\u2009bp shorter (P\u2009<\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221215, two-tailed unequal-variance t-test) in alt allele group compared to ref allele group on TP variants consistent with a fetal origin and no such difference was seen in FP variants. d, e Sensitivity (d) and PPV (e) comparison for different filtering methods using 28 validation samples. By applying both the ACD and FMID variant filters, the test sensitivity was essentially unchanged at 99.5% while the PPV was significantly improved (P\u2009<\u20090.01). When only the ACD filter was used, the test sensitivity was reduced to 96.8% (P\u2009<\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128). Upper whisker (Q3\u2009+\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR), Q3, Q2, average, Q1, lower whisker (Q1\u2009\u2013\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR), and all non-outlier data points between lower and upper whiskers were demonstrated on the box plot.

                        "As demonstrated above, we developed a new NIPS method that can genetically deconvolute the cfDNA admixture in maternal plasma by querying NGS data associated with fetal and maternal genotypes, RD, SNP linkage, and cfDNA fragment length. Next, we clinically validated this new method using retrospective samples collected from pregnant women. Reproducibility studies including intra-assay, inter-assay, and inter-person were performed, all of which generated consistent results (Supplementary Table S4). Clinical data including testing indication and pregnancy outcome of 1149 cases were collected. Among them, 20 samples were excluded due to detected dizygotic twin pregnancy, egg donor, and maternal CNV/AOH (Fig. 6). The remaining cases were tested for three common chromosomal aneuploidies, eight MMS, and ten monogenic disorders (Materials and methods). For those 1129 samples analyzed, the average gestational age at the time of collection was 15.3 weeks, and the average maternal age was 32.5 years (Supplementary Table S5). There were 426/1129 (37.7%) women with advanced maternal age (\u2265\u200935 years). In the positive cases, 34/70 (48.6%) had increased nuchal translucency or abnormal structural findings (heart structural abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, etc.); 27/70 (38.6%) had advanced maternal age; 4/70 (5.7%) had abnormal serum screening results; and 5/70 (7.1%) had no known indications (Table 1). For common aneuploidies (T21, T18, and T13), the most frequent indication was advanced maternal age, consistent with previous reports31. Two 22q11.2del cases (P55 and P56) were found with abnormal heart development such as tetralogy of Fallot, right aortic arch, persistent left superior vena cava and unclear display of arterial duct, which were consistent with the phenotype of DiGeorge syndrome. MMS cases detected in this study had various or no abnormal prenatal findings (P57 and P61), suggesting the necessity of an expanded NIPS for MMS without specific prenatal indications (Table 1). Eight cases with monogenic variants were detected, all of which were consistent with the prenatal findings seen in these disorders. In subjects P63 and P64 with de novo pathogenic variants in the PTPN11 and SOS1 genes, common findings in Noonan spectrum disorder such as thickened pulmonary valve and other anomalies were found in the prenatal ultrasound screening (Table 1). In subjects P65\u2013P70, all fetuses had severe skeletal phenotypes by ultrasound, which were consistent with the findings of pathogenic variants in skeleton-related genes such as FGFR3, FGFR2, COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL2A1 (Table 1).Fig. 6Clinical validation for multiple types of genetic disorders using pregnant women\u2019s plasma samples.A total of 1149 samples collected from pregnant women\u2019s blood were tested. Among them, 20 samples were excluded due to analytical interferences including 13 dizygotic twin pregnancies, one twin pregnancy through egg donor, four with maternal CNV (\u22653\u2009Mb), and two with maternal AOH which also failed RD analysis quality control. Next, 1129 samples were subjected to further analysis, and 70 positive cases were identified through the new NIPS method, including 54 aneuploidies, eight MMS and eight cases with monogenic disorders. Clinical information and prenatal findings were collected and shown for 70 positive cases.Table 1Summary of positive clinical cases.SubjectGestation age (weeks)Maternal age (years)Prenatal

                "Accurate and early prenatal diagnosis is essential for the management of the fetal risks for severe genetic diseases. NIPS, through the analysis of fetal cfDNA present in maternal plasma has thus become a prevalent screening approach for common aneuploidies with improved analytical accuracy over conventional biochemical methods or ultrasound screening32,33. Significant advances have been made for NIPS by NGS technologies in recent years, which expanded its use for more genetic disorders12,20,34\u201340. However, the inability to reconcile different genetic cues in a single NIPS assay prevents its expansion for the concurrent screening of different types of genetic disorders and improvements on test performance (Supplementary Table S7).",
                "To develop an expanded and enhanced NIPS test in the present work, we applied a top-down design strategy comprised of novel laboratory technologies, comprehensive genomic algorithms, and diseases-specific interpretation analytics. Importantly, a new hybridization-based target enrichment method, termed COATE-seq, was established through allelic probe sequence manipulation (Fig. 1). COATE-seq suppresses the allelic enrichment biases and sequencing variations inherent to conventional methods, which are detrimental to the detection of low-level fetal variants in maternal plasma (Fig. 1). With much improved signal-to-noise ratio, COATE-seq requires only ~20% of the loci used in previous methods to detect common human aneuploidies11,12. Next, genomic algorithms were developed to analyze multidimensional cfDNA data including RD, AF, fragment lengths, and linked SNPs to uncover maternal/fetal genotype, meiotic error origins, and meiotic recombination (Figs. 2\u20135). Overall, the above inventions for important assay reagents, laboratory procedures, and genomic algorithms enabled comprehensive delineation of the fetal genome, which allows the highly accurate detection of fetus-specific variants (Supplementary Table S6).",
                "An important finding resulting from the improved analytical performance of COATE-seq is the discovery of aneuploidy chromosome recombinants in fetal cfDNA (Fig. 4). Common aneuploidies have characteristic parental and meiotic NDJ patterns26,27,41. Previous studies showed that the number of meiotic recombination events and the location of crossovers were associated with aneuploidies caused by different meiotic errors30,42. Using the NIPS method in this work, we found that 22 T21 cases had a single crossover associated with meiotic NDJ in which most MI NDJ cases had breakpoints within the ~10\u2009Mb of the telomere, while most MII NDJ cases had breakpoints within ~6\u2009Mb of the centromere (Supplementary Fig. S9). This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that recombination breakpoints identified in MI or MII NDJ are in proximity to either telomere or centromere, respectively30,42. These results contrast with the location of breakpoints of normal meiotic recombinants which are evenly distributed on both ends of the chromosome30,42. With millions of NIPS tests conducted worldwide every year, our method provides a unique tool to investigate the origins of aneuploidies and meiotic recombination from the population perspective.",
                "It should be noted that many frequent and severe recessive monogenic diseases are caused by complex variants residing in genomic regions with homologous sequences (e.g., SMN1, HBA1/A2, CYP21A2, etc.). Recent developments in NGS or long-read sequencing analytics enabled the detection of carriers of the pathogenic variants in these difficult genes43\u201345. However, such variants are not amenable to NIPS tests largely due to the short fragment length of cfDNA. Haplotype-based NIPS for recessive variants has limited utility as pretest information of parental haplotype cannot be readily obtained in population screening. A significant amount of work on current platforms or new technologies are required to develop a practical NIPS test which has superior performance to current carrier testing for those important recessive disorders mentioned above.",
                "Concurrent NIPS for different types of genetic disorders is of obvious clinical value. Monogenic diseases which do not present with gross structural anomalies during early fetal development (e.g., FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia) may be missed in the first-trimester ultrasound screening. By coupling monogenic diseases and chromosomal aberrations for NIPS in early gestation, it allows a more inclusive genetic screen complementing current image-based approaches. While expanding the scope of NIPS has sensible benefits, evidence-based studies for such screening are yet to be performed to prove its clinical utility. In future studies, it will be important to address key issues such as disease inclusion criteria for screening, proper testing indications, and reporting or genetic counseling strategies for variants of phenotypic variability or incomplete penetrance. In addition, pregnancy management options and their outcomes need to be evaluated for individuals affected by either positive or negative screening results to weigh the benefits and risks of offering a comprehensive NIPS test.",
                "Overall, we presented here a comprehensive NIPS approach with improvements in assay performance, underlying technical innovations, and new cfDNA analytical algorithms. This new approach overcomes the limitations of current methods, which do not concurrently screen chromosomal and monogenic disorders and are confounded by multiple gestations, and maternal CNV and AOH. This method shows its potential in clinical application, especially enabling a more accurate prenatal screening on a broad spectrum of genetic diseases and providing valuable assistance for risk evaluation and timely management of pregnancy."

For each cluster, if the center has a Z-score >\u20093 or <\u2009\u20133, then a potential maternal CNV is called.

For samples with maternal mosaic CNV, if the mosaic level is <\u20090.6, it is beyond the detection limit using the Z-score method. To reduce the false positive calls, the SNP AFs in regions with potential maternal CNV are also examined. For samples that have a maternal deletion, the heterozygous SNP AF is >\u20090.6 or <\u20090.4. For samples that have a maternal duplication, the heterozygous AF is between 0.4 and 0.6.

In trisomies caused by maternal meiotic errors, multiple consecutive fetal homozygous SNPs (AAA or BBB) at the loci where the mother is heterozygous are indicative of MII NDJ (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Similarly, when the homologs are transmitted in MI NDJ, no extensive stretch of fetal homozygous SNPs should be present at the loci where the mother is heterozygous (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Therefore, the presence of both MI NDJ and MII NDJ fetal genotypes are suggestive of a recombinant event (Supplementary Fig. S6b, c). In MI NDJ causing fetal trisomy, at the maternal heterozygous loci (AB), the probability of fetus being heterozygous (ABA or ABB) is 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, when fetal homozygosity (genotype AAA or BBB) disrupting the MI NDJ pattern is seen, it can only be explained by an event of meiotic recombination. In MII NDJ, the probability of a fetus being heterozygous (genotype AAB or ABB) at a maternal heterozygous locus is 0.5 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Assuming all loci are transmitted independently and there is no recombination, the probability of 10 consecutive informative SNPs showing only fetal heterozygosity is 2\u221210 in MII. Therefore, we use a cut-off of 10 continuous fetal heterozygous loci to determine whether there is a MI NDJ."

For each insert-size from the alternative allele supporting group, a modified binary search algorithm was used to locate the closet insert-size value in the reference allele supporting group. The fragment with the nearest neighbor insert-size value from the reference allele supporting group was then excluded. Specifically, the same number of fragments carrying reference allele that had similar size of those carrying alternative allele were excluded to better distinguish maternal- and fetal-origin fragments (Fig. 5b). After multiple iterations for all the alternative allele reads, the surviving reference allele reads can be regarded as being from the maternal origin. Then insert-sizes of the remaining reads were tested under four different hypotheses followed by a median comparison to test whether the alternative allele fragments were indeed statistically different and shorter than the reference allele fragments. To compare the difference of fragment length between the alternative allele reads and reference allele reads, the P-values of four hypotheses including Welch\u2019s t-test, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis H-test with correction for ties and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test with correction for ties were calculated.
