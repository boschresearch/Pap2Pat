                        "Birth defects may refer to abnormal growth and development of a fetus in the mother's womb, resulting in congenital defects that are already present at birth. With a large population, the number of birth defects in China increases by about 900,000 per year, and the incidence of birth defects is about 5.6% [1]. Birth defects are a major cause of death and disability of infants and young children, and have become a major public health problem affecting the health of the population, and the resultant social and economic burden is heavy.",
                        "Genetic factors may be an important cause of birth defects, and both chromosomal abnormalities and monogenic diseases can cause many types of birth defects. Chromosomal abnormalities may comprise copy number abnormalities and structural abnormalities, and the most common copy number abnormality is chromosomal aneuploidy, the incidence of which is about 1/160 at birth [2]. Chromosomal aneuploidy may refer to the difference between chromosome number and the diploid genome (46, XX or 46, XY), such as a gain or deletion of a chromosome. Common genetic diseases of chromosomal aneuploidy include chromosome 21 (T21, Down syndrome), chromosome 18 (T18, Edwards' syndrome), and chromosome 13 (T13, Patau syndrome), which often result in fetal structural abnormalities, multi-organ malformations, and developmental disorders, with high mortality and disability, for which there is no effective treatment. Chromosomal structural abnormalities may include microdeletion and microduplication, and some common ones are 22q11.2, 1p36, 5q deletion syndromes, and the like [2].",
                        "In view of the above-mentioned clinical issues associated with chromosomal aneuploidy, screening during pregnancy and prenatal diagnosis may be effective approaches to prevent and control the incidence of birth defects. Traditional screening methods may include serological examinations and imaging examinations, which assess the risk of fetal genetic defects by detecting changes in the levels of various biomarkers in maternal serum at different stages of pregnancy, combined with ultrasound imaging observations, and prenatal diagnosis by placental chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis [3]. The disadvantages of these methods may include the low sensitivity of serological examination (about 69-96%) and the high rate of false positives (about 5%) for the 3 trisomy syndromes mentioned above [4]. In addition, although prenatal diagnosis has high sensitivity and specificity, it may be an invasive detection and may pose certain risk of fetal abortion (about 0.5-1%) [2]. Therefore, there exists a need for improved non-invasive screening techniques to further improve the sensitivity and specificity of analytical methods without increasing the risk of pregnancy, especially to reduce the false-positive and false-negative detection results caused by technical limitations of existing techniques during large-scale clinical application. Such scientific and clinical research directions may improve the clinical effectiveness of prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormality diseases.",
                        "The discovery of fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma during pregnancy has driven the development of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) technology and its clinical application [5]. Since 2011, NIPS has been offered nationwide in China to pregnant women as a prenatal screening test, and its sensitivity and specificity, as well as clinical verifiability, have been validated in hundreds of thousands of clinical samples [6]. It may be shown that fetal cell-free DNA is derived from apoptotic cells in fetal placental tissue, that its concentration in maternal peripheral blood varies over time, and that it is rapidly cleared by the mother after delivery [7, 8]. Since fetal cell-free DNA contains fetal genetic information, appropriate detection methods (quantitative PCR, digital PCR, high-throughput sequencing, etc.) can be used to screen for chromosomal abnormalities and assess the risk of fetal genetic defects, and its non-invasive nature can also avoid the risk of maternal miscarriage. The non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) that has been widely used for chromosomal aneuploidy can be performed in early pregnancy (9-12 weeks) using maternal peripheral blood as the sample, with simple and safe sampling method, and has high sensitivity (about 97-99%) and low false-positive rate (<0.1%) for chromosomal aneuploidy detection such as T21, T18, and T13, which has been widely validated and recognized by clinical practice [9-13]. The current mainstream NIPS detection method may be based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), which uses the massively parallel sequencing to analyze the depth of the reads of maternal and fetal DNA fragments in a sample, and determines the number of fetal chromosomes of interest with WGS by measuring the ratio of reads in the chromosome of interest to reads on a corresponding diploid reference chromosome. Although this method can effectively detect common chromosomal aneuploidy such as T21, T18 and T13, as well as microdeletions/microduplications of some large segments, the WGS method may be inaccurate in quantifying the proportion of fetal cell-free DNA in practice (especially for female fetuses), which may cause bias in the interpretation of valid samples and affect the reliability of the detection. In addition, the low-depth WGS method may be less sensitive to microdeletions/microduplications of small chromosomal segments and cannot detect triploidy, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. In addition, false positive results are often seen in clinical practice due to the inability to identify common maternal chimerism of low abundance (e.g. 45\u00d7) [14].",
                        "There may be two methods for detection of chromosomal aneuploidy in fetal cell-free DNA using NGS technology, depending on the experimental principle and data analysis algorithms. In addition to the aforementioned method based on low-depth whole genome sequencing (WGS), there is also a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) method based on targeted sequencing [15]. The present disclosure uses a quantitative analysis method based on SNP targeted high-depth sequencing and genotyping (SNP-targeted high-depth sequencing and genotyping) to quantify NIPS, showing its advantages over the WGS method (shown in the table below). The method features the use of maternal genotype information and paternal genotype estimated by frequencies of SNPs in population to construct possible fetal normal or abnormal genotypes caused by chromosome copy number variation. The method features the use of maternal genotype information and paternal genotype estimated by frequencies of SNPs in population to construct possible fetal normal or abnormal genotypes. The probability of each fetal genotype may be calculated by comparing the theoretical predicted value of minor allele fraction (MAF) at each SNP site with the actual measured value in plasma cell-free DNA. Since this method only examines the quantitative variation of MAF of cell-free DNA at each SNP site to derive the possible fetal genotype, it may not require the use of diploid reference chromosomes as in the case of NIPS with WGS, thus simplifying the detection operations and analysis requirements. However, current SNP methods may be based on multiplex PCR, and this amplification technique may be prone to ADO (allelic drop-out) in the analysis of highly fragmented cell-free DNA, thus requiring the simultaneous analysis of approximately 20,000 SNP sites to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for chromosome copy number quantification [14].",
                        "The WGS method may obtain sequencing data (reads) of all chromosomes by whole genome sequencing, detect the relative increase or decrease in reads of chromosomes of interest using aneuploidy-specific algorithms, detect the fetal fraction (FF) in cell-free DNA, and calculate the risk probability of abnormal chromosome number (trisomy or monosomy) by reads distribution and quantitative statistics. In contrast, the SNP method may not perform whole chromosome sequencing on all chromosomes, but only quantitatively genotypes a certain number of polymorphic sites in the genome, and calculates FF and the risk probability of aneuploidy by measuring the difference in the contribution of cell-free DNA from different sources (fetal or maternal) to the genotypic signal. For each SNP site, the contribution of the fetal genome (e.g., C/C with C at 100%) influences to some extent the allelic equilibrium in the maternal genome (e.g., C/T with C at 50%). Thus, when the fetal genotype differs from the maternal genotype with FF at 10%, the balanced C in the cell-free DNA in peripheral blood of pregnant women at this allele site is shifted from 50% to 55%. Thus, the SNP method may allow inferring the risk probability of aneuploidy by analyzing thousands at SNP sites in different regions of the genome, based on the equilibrium shifts of their alleles. For both methods, a goal may be to calculate copy number variation from reads of a specific chromosome or genomic region or allelic equilibrium at SNP sites.",
                        "Currently, WGS methods (e.g., Illumina) [16] and SNP methods (e.g., Natera) [17] are widely used internationally, while in China, many clinical applications use WGS methods at present [18, 19]. In practical application, the WGS methods have many limitations. Its sensitivity and specificity may be limited by the fetal cell-free DNA fraction, the sensitivity of the detection of microdeletion/microduplication may be low, and it may be difficult to detect twin pregnancies and twin and singleton survival rates, etc. In addition, the WGS method may require more sequencing data and is more costly, whereas the SNP method can avoid unnecessary sequencing reads on non-target chromosomes because it is based on genotyping targeted sequencing. For chromosomal microdeletion/microduplication diseases such as 22q11.2del syndrome with deletion fragments within 0.5-3 Mb, targeted enrichment amplification primers can be designed based on specific chromosomal regions for directed sequencing analysis of chromosomes of interest to achieve higher detection efficiency [20]."

In some embodiments, for fetal chromosome copy number detection, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used to quantitatively analyze maternal and fetal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in captured target regions. In some embodiments, statistical methods are used to integrate multiple metrics of cell-free DNA (length of the cell-free DNA, sequencing depth of the target region and allelic mutation rate) with risk factors of different disease (maternal genotype and possible disease inheritance/occurrence patterns) to enable multidimensional analysis of chromosome and genetic variations across parents, chromosomal fragment sizes and cytogenetic mechanisms. There may be currently at least two methods of NIPS using cfDNA sequencing: (1) whole genome low-depth random sequencing (WGS method) and (2) high-depth targeted sequencing (TS method). The WGS method determines the number of targeted fetal chromosome by measuring the ratio of the reads on the targeted chromosome to the reads on the corresponding diploid reference chromosome. Since the WGS method may not be selective for the chromosomal origin of DNA fragments to be sequenced, and chromosomes 21, 18 and 13 represent only 7.85% of the human genome, millions of fragments may need to be sequenced to ensure sufficient counts for chromosomes 21, 18, and 13 to obtain accurate results. In contrast, the high-depth targeted sequencing method may feature dozens of possible fetal normal or abnormal genotypes constructed using maternal genotype information and paternal genotypes estimated from frequencies of SNPs in humans. The theoretical predicted value of minor allele fraction (MAF) for each SNP site is then compared with the actual plasma measurements to calculate the relative probability of each hypothesis. The method may consider only the possible fetal genotypes and does not require the use of diploid reference chromosomes. The present disclosure provides improved approaches that use COATE technology to select a region of a specific target chromosome for the design of target capture probe. Compared with previous NIPS based on multiplex PCR for SNP analysis, methods and systems of the present disclosure may select fewer loci for sequencing analysis and can analyze common human chromosomal aneuploidy and microdeletion diseases more effectively. In addition, methods and systems of the present disclosure may simultaneously select the gene coding regions of common human monogenic dominant genetic diseases, including FGFR3, FGFR2, PTPN11, RAF1, RIT1, SOS1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, OTC, MECP2, and other genes as probes to simultaneously detect the process of chromosomal aneuploidy and monogenic mutations, which can effectively detect common dominant monogenic diseases. Monogenic mutation probes can be designed by using capture probe of interest and ordering software tools such as www.idtdna.com/site/order/ngs/%3F.",
                        "Chromosomes of interest (chr1-22, chrX, chrY) and SNP sites for the common chromosomal micro-deletion/duplication disorders (affecting CNV regions of 0.5 Mb or larger in size) may be selected for probe design. Any fetal variation, either single nucleotide or chromosomal variation can be detected in maternal plasma as long as the fetal and maternal genotypes are not exactly the same. In NGS, this detectability depends on the fetal cell-free DNA fraction (fetal DNA as a percentage of total maternal plasma cfDNA) and the sequencing depth. Although whole genome low-depth sequencing can be used to detect certain nondiploids, this method may not be applicable to smaller chromosomal copy number variants or genetic variants at the gene level. To detect all fetal genetic variants in maternal plasma, targeted enrichment methods can be used, including probe hybridization or PCR amplification of regions of interest for directed high-depth sequencing. Because liquid-phase hybridization using DNA oligonucleotides may not require region-specific primers, this has the advantage of fewer allele drop-outs in enriching highly fragmented cfDNA. However, probe oligonucleotides have different hybridization thermodynamics for different individual target regions, as even a single non-complementary base between the target region and the probe may result in different hybridization thermodynamics. This raises the issue that NGS-based detection methods rely on accurate genotyping and quantification of the diallele fraction for the detection of copy number variation in NIPS. In NGS, the central allele fraction (CAF) of a germ-line heterozygous variant may be expected to be 50% when the sampling (DNA input) and sequencing (sequencing depth) are sufficient. However, using current NGS techniques, the CAF measured in euploid samples is not always exactly 50%, due to unavoidable experimental errors introduced by different site-specific hybridization kinetics [14]. If the error in measured euploid CAF is too large, it can mask A F changes caused by gene copy number variation in the fetus in maternal plasma. When conventional probe design is based on reference sequences, we found CAFs consistently below 50.0% across >2,000 allelic loci, with a range of 43.1-49.4%. Such a systematic bias may indicate that the hybridization efficiency between the probe and the region of interest with the mutation (minor allele) is slightly lower because the probe is usually designed based on the reference allele (usually major allele). In some embodiments, a coordinated design (COATE) of probes is performed for the chromosome aneuploidy, microdeletion/microduplication, and monogenic target region allele of interest, which suppressed the bias of allele hybridization kinetics.",
                        "The COATE method used herein can allow calculation of the difference in hybridization annealing temperature (\u0394Tm) between the probe and the target including the reference and mutant alleles. In any given single nucleotide diallele locus, there are four probes (-A-, -G-, -C-, -T-), two of which are complementary to the reference or mutant allele and the other two are not complementary to the reference or mutant allele. Unlike conventional probe designs, such probe combinations may not require complementarity with reference genomic sequences or mutant sequences; these probes may or may not be complementary to the reference or mutant alleles, and it is only necessary that the probes have minimal \u0394Tm to the reference gene sequence (wild-type) and mutant sequence (mutant-type) in the capture region.",
                        "An allele of the SNP sites with relatively high distribution in populations is called wild-type (B), and an allele with relatively low distribution in populations is called mutant-type (A), the homozygous wild genotype is BB, the homozygous mutant genotype is AA, and the heterozygous genotype is AB. In some embodiments, the sequence selection of these probes follows the following principle: for every 100 nucleotides in the reference genomic sequence, the probe sequence contains up to 10 nucleotides different from the reference genomic sequence, and the rest are identical to the reference genomic sequence. In order to obtain polynucleotides whose nucleotide sequences are at least 90% identical to the reference genomic sequence, up to 10% of the nucleotides in the reference genomic sequence may be substituted by other nucleotides or deleted; or some nucleotides may be inserted into the reference sequence, wherein the inserted nucleotides may be up to 10% of the total nucleotides of the reference sequence; or in some probes, there is a combination of deletions, insertions and substitutions, wherein the deleted, inserted and substituted nucleotides are up to 10% of the total nucleotides of the reference sequence. These deletions, insertions and substitutions in the reference sequence may occur at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the reference nucleotide sequence, or anywhere therebetween, and they are either scattered in the of the reference sequence alone or present in one or more adjacent groups in the reference sequence.",
                        "The detection method provided herein may be innovative for at least the following reasons. There may be two analytical methods for NIPS by sequencing maternal plasma cell-free DNA: the low-depth whole genome sequencing (WGS) method and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) method with high-depth targeted sequencing. The WGS method may determine the ploidy of targeted fetal chromosome by measuring the ratio of the reads on the targeted chromosome to the reads of the corresponding diploid reference chromosome. Since the WGS method may not be selective for the chromosomal origin of DNA fragments to be sequenced, and chromosomes 21, 18, and 13 represent only 7.85% of the human genome, millions of fragments may need to be sequenced to ensure sufficient counts for chromosomes 21, 18, and 13 to obtain high confidence results. The SNP method, on the other hand, may be directed to analyze only some of locus in the landmark regions of the chromosomes of interest and therefore, the amount of DNA need for sequencing can be significantly reduced compared to the WGS method. The method is based on maternal genotype information and the paternal genotype calculated from the frequencies of SNPs in humans, which is used to construct possible fetal normal or abnormal genotypes. The theoretical predicted value of minor allele fraction (MAF) for each SNP site is then compared with the actual plasma measurements and the relative likelihood of each hypothesis is calculated. This method may consider only the possible fetal genotypes and does not require the use of diploid reference chromosomes as in the WGS method, thereby reducing the requirements for experimental manipulation and data analysis. The current SNP method may be based on multiplex PCR technique, and this amplification technique may be prone to allele drop-out (ADO) in the analysis of highly fragmented cell-free DNA, thus tens of thousands at SNP sites need to be analyzed simultaneously to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for chromosome copy number quantification. To address this problem, the present method uses an innovative liquid-phase hybridization technique to selectively capture polymorphic loci for sequencing, avoiding the use of region-specific amplification primers and reducing the probability of ADO occurrence. Moreover, the present technique for SNPs in the region of interest may be designed by using customized oligonucleotide probes (coordinative allele-aware target enrichment), which can reduce the bias of liquid-phase hybridization kinetics of capture probes toward different allelic loci in the genome, improve the capture efficiency and homogeneity of the region of interest, and achieve accurate quantitative chromosome analysis. Based on the above innovative technologies, the present method can achieve highly efficient detection of common chromosomal aneuploidy and microdeletion/microduplication diseases by sequencing and analyzing only 2320 SNP sites, and has a significantly reduced number of loci compared to the previous multiplex PCR-based SNP analysis method.",

Various aspects of the technology may be thought of as \u201cproducts\u201d or \u201carticles of manufacture\u201d typically in the form of machine (or processor) executable code and/or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Machine-executable code can be stored on an electronic storage unit, such as memory (e.g., read-only memory, random-access memory, flash memory) or a hard disk. \u201cStorage\u201d type media can include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers, processors or the like, or associated modules thereof, such as various semiconductor memories, tape drives, disk drives and the like, which may provide non-transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications, for example, may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another, for example, from a management server or host computer into the computer platform of an application server. Thus, another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical, electrical and electromagnetic waves, such as used across physical interfaces between local devices, through wired and optical landline networks and over various air-links. The physical elements that carry such waves, such as wired or wireless links, optical links or the like, also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein, unless restricted to non-transitory, tangible \u201cstorage\u201d media, terms such as computer or machine \u201creadable medium\u201d refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.",

Non-volatile storage media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any computer(s) or the like, such as may be used to implement the databases, etc. shown in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables; copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that include a bus within a computer system. Carrier-wave transmission media may take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media therefore include for example: a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards paper tape, any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a ROM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or links transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer may read programming code and/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.",

In addition, among these 8 samples, the average CAF value of heterozygote mutation in each sample is also closer to 0.5 (CAFCOATE=0.499, CAFCONVENTION=0.495, p=0.00001, 95% CI, N=8, as shown in FIG. 7b).",

At present, it is believed that there are at least three different non-disjunction modes of meiosis: homologous chromosome non-disjunction occurs during the first meiophase (MI) of the oocytes, and sister chromatid non-disjunction occurs during the second meiophase (MII) of the oocytes. The third non-disjunction mode is relatively rare and is chromosome non-disjunction during the mitosis occurring after the formation of fertilized eggs. The situation in which trisomy is formed when oocytes do not undergo chromosomal recombination is described in examples 5-6. The following example illustrates a calculation mode of trisomy syndrome formed after the oocytes undergo a chromosomal recombination. If the oocytes undergo homologous chromosome recombination during MI and homologous chromosome non-disjunction in MI occurs, it is needed to consider the mixing mode of L(MI/MII) when calculating the likelihood value of fetal trisomy; and if the oocytes undergo homologous chromosomal recombination during MI, and the sister chromatid non-disjunction in MII occurs, it is needed to consider a mixing mode of L (MII/MI) when calculating the likelihood value of fetal trisomy.
