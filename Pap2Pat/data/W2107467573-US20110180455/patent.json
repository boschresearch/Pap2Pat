                        "In the Fischer-Tropsch process, synthesis gas (CO+H2) is catalytically transformed into oxygen-containing products and into basically linear hydrocarbons in gaseous, liquid or solid form. These products are generally free of heteroatomic impurities such as for example sulphur, nitrogen or metals. They also contain almost no or only a few aromatics, naphthenes and more generally cyclics, in particular in the case of cobalt catalysts. In contrast, they may have a non-negligible content of oxygen-containing products which, expressed as the weight of oxygen, is generally less than 5% by weight and also a content of unsaturated substances (olefinic products in general) which is generally less than 10% by weight. However, these products, consisting mainly of normal paraffins, cannot be used as they are, in particular because of their cold resistance properties which are not compatible with the usual uses of petroleum cuts. For example, the pour point of a linear hydrocarbon containing 20 carbon atoms per molecule (boiling temperature equal to about 340\u00b0 C., i.e. often in the middle distillates cut range) is about +37\u00b0 C., rendering its use impossible, as the specification is \u221215\u00b0 C. for gas oil.",
                        "The starting feedstocks which are intended to be treated in a gasification unit producing a gas consisting basically of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, known to a person skilled in the art by the name of synthesis gas, said synthesis gas subsequently allowing a set of hydrocarbon cuts to be recomposed by means of the Fischer-Tropsch process, can be obtained from renewable sources such as, for example, lignocellulose-type feedstocks, such as wood or straw waste. Lignocellulose products are formed mainly from lignins and cellulose. The impurities contained in this type of lignocellulose biomass feedstock are basically solid impurities, in particular alkali, metals (Na, K) and sulphur-containing compounds, as well as chlorine-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds.",
                        "The starting feedstocks can also be obtained from renewable sources, such as oils and fats of vegetable or animal origin, or from mixtures of such feedstocks, containing triglycerides and/or fatty acids and/or esters. Of the possible vegetable oils, they may be crude or, totally or partially, refined, and obtained from the following vegetables: rape, sunflower, soya, palm, oil palm, olive, coconut, jatropha (this list not entailing any limitation). Algae or fish oils are also relevant. Of the possible fats, examples include all the animal fats such as lard or fats composed of residues from the food industry or obtained from the catering industries. The feedstocks thus defined contain triglyceride structures and/or fatty acids, the fatty chains of which contain a number of carbon atoms of between 8 and 25.",
                        "The starting feedstocks which are intended to be treated in a gasification unit producing a gas consisting basically of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, known to a person skilled in the art by the name of synthesis gas, said synthesis gas subsequently allowing a set of hydrocarbon cuts to be recomposed by means of the Fischer-Tropsch process, can also be obtained from coal which is finely ground and purified so as to contain a reduced concentration of ash.",
                        "The hydrocarbons obtained by the Fischer-Tropsch process, most of which comprise n-paraffins, have to be transformed into products which are more amenable to beneficiation, such as, for example, gas oil, kerosene, and are obtained, for example, after hydroisomerisation catalytic reactions.",
                        "All of the catalysts currently used in hydroisomerisation/hydrocracking are of the bifunctional type combining an acid function with a hydrogenating function. The acid function is provided by substrates having large surface areas (generally 150 to 800 m2 g\u22121) and superficial acidity, such as halogenated (in particular chlorine-containing or fluorine-containing) aluminas, phosphorus-containing aluminas, combinations of boron and aluminium oxides, and silica-aluminas. The hydrogenating function is provided either by one or more metals from group VIII of the periodic table of the elements, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum, or by a combination of at least one group VI metal, such as chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, and at least one group VIII metal.",
                        "The balance between the two functions, the acid function and the hydrogenating function, is one of the parameters governing the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst. A weak acid function and a strong hydrogenating function provide inactive catalysts which are selective in relation to isomerisation while a strong acid function and a weak hydrogenating function provide very active catalysts which are selective in relation to cracking. A third possibility is to use a strong acid function and a strong hydrogenating function in order to obtain a catalyst which is very active but also very selective in relation to isomerisation. It is therefore possible, by judiciously selecting each of the functions, to adjust the activity/selectivity pairing of the catalyst.",
                        "The conventional catalysts of catalytic hydrocracking consist, for the most part, of weakly acidic substrates, such as silica-aluminas for example. These systems are more specifically used to produce very good quality middle distillates. Substrates having low acidity include the family of the silica-aluminas. Many commercially available hydrocracking catalysts are based on silica-alumina combined with a group VIII metal. These systems have very good middle distillate selectivity, and the products formed are of very good quality (U.S. Pat. No. 6,733,657). The drawback of all these silica-alumina-based catalytic systems is, as stated hereinbefore, their low activity. Conversely, zeolite (in particular USY or beta zeolite)-based catalytic systems are very active for the hydrocracking reaction but unselective.",
                        "By attempting to develop catalysts for the hydrocracking and hydroisomerisation of paraffinic feedstocks such as the feedstocks obtained by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the applicant has discovered a process for producing middle distillates from a paraffinic feedstock produced by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, implementing a new hydrocracking/hydroisomerisation catalyst comprising at least one hydro-dehydrogenating metal selected from the group formed by the metals from group VIB and from group.

One of the preferred methods for conducting the reduction of the metal is the treatment under hydrogen at a temperature of between 150\u00b0 C. and 650\u00b0 C. and a total pressure of between 1 and 250 bar. For example, a reduction consists in a stage at 150\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, then a rise in temperature to 450\u00b0 C. at the rate of 1\u00b0 C./min, then a two-hour stage at 450\u00b0 C.; throughout this reduction step, the hydrogen flow rate is 1,000 normal litres of hydrogen/litre of catalyst.
