    "title": "Sparstolonin B, a Novel Plant Derived Compound, Arrests Cell Cycle and Induces Apoptosis in N-Myc Amplified and N-Myc Nonamplified Neuroblastoma Cells",
    "date": "2014-05-01",
    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors and accounts for \u223c 15% of all the cancer related deaths in the children. Despite the standard therapy for advanced disease including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the mortality rate remains high for these patients. Hence, novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Here we examined the anticancer activity of a novel plant-derived compound, sparstolonin B (SsnB; 8,5'-dihydroxy-4-phenyl-5,2'-oxidoisocoumarin) using neuroblastoma cell lines of different genetics. SsnB was recently isolated from an aquatic Chinese herb, Sparganium stoloniferum, and tubers of this herb have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases and cancers. Our cell viability and morphological analysis indicated that SsnB at 10 \u00b5M concentration significantly inhibited the growth of both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2), NGP, and IMR-32 cells) and N-myc nonamplified (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells) neuroblastoma cells. The flow cytometric analyses suggested that SsnB arrests the cell cycle progression at G2-M phase in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Exposure of SsnB inhibited the compact spheroid formation and reduced the tumorigenicity of SH-SY5Y cells and SK-N-BE(2) cells in in vitro 3-D cell culture assays (anchorage-independent colony formation assay and hanging drop assay). SsnB lowers the cellular level of glutathione (GSH), increases generation of reactive oxygen species and activates the cleavage of caspase-3 whereas co-incubation of a GSH precursor, N-acetylcysteine, along with SsnB attenuates the inhibitory effects of SsnB and increases the neuroblastoma cell viability. Our results for the first time demonstrate that SsnB possesses anticancer activity indicating that SsnB-induced reactive oxygen species generation promotes apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background. Thus these data suggest that SsnB can be a promising drug candidate in neuroblastoma therapy.",

                "Sparstolonin B (SsnB) is a novel plant derived active compound recently isolated from the tubers of an aquatic herb, Sparganium stoloniferum [1]. In vivo and in vitro studies revealed its anti-inflammatory [1], [2] and anti-angiogenic [3] properties. SsnB acts as an antagonist to Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4), and exhibits anti-inflammatory property by selectively inhibiting TLR2 and TLR4-triggered inflammatory response in mouse and human macrophages [1], [2]. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the tubers of this herb have been used for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases, and the crude extract prepared form this herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4]\u2013[6]. As revealed by NMR and X-ray crystallography, SsnB (8,5\u2032-dyhydroxy-4-phenyl-5,2\u2032-oxidoisocoumarin) is a polyphenol with structural similarities to isocoumarins and xanthone. Isocoumarins and xanthone family of compounds are well known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties [7]\u2013[10]. Due to the structural similarities of SsnB with isocoumarins and xanthone, we decided to examine the anticancerous properties of SsnB.",
                "Neuroblastoma is a malignant pediatric cancer of the postganglionic sympathetic nervous system and derived from the neural crest cells during embryonic development. Initially it develops in the adrenal gland and metastasizes to liver, bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, neck and chest. It is the most common cancer in babies younger than one and second most common tumor in children [11], [12]. It accounts for 7% of all childhood cancers (Cancer Facts & Figures 2013. Atlanta, GA: American Cancer Society, 2013), and is responsible for 15% of all cancer deaths in children younger than 15 years. About 30%\u201350% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma experience long-term survival.",
                "Neuroblastoma tumor comprises of various heterogeneous population of cells which differ at morphological, biochemical and genetic levels [13]\u2013[15]. Genomic amplification of N-myc gene, rearrangement or deletion of distal region of the chromosome 1 (1p31-arm) [16], [17] or alterations in chromosomes 11, 14 and 17 [18], [19] are most common cytogenetic features identified in low to advance stages of neuroblastomas. Mutations in tumor suppresser genes, i.e., p53, retinoblastoma, RET, p16, p18 or p27 have been reported to promote tumorigenesis [20]\u2013[22]. These karyotype and cytogenetic alterations render tumors resistant to available chemotherapies [23]. For example, retinoic acid induces neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cells [24], [25] and commonly used as in residual therapy. However, neuroblastoma cells with N-myc amplified oncogene do not respond to retinoic acid [26], [27]. Therefore, it is crucial to find new therapeutic agents that can exhibit anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells irrespective of their genetic abnormalities.",
                "In the present study, for the first time we have reported the anticancer activity of SsnB and have demonstrated that SsnB inhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background by arresting cell cycle progression and by inducing apoptotic cell death through generation of reactive oxygen species."

To test whether SsnB-induced cell death is resulted from increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we performed H2DCFDA staining [31], [32]. H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable non-fluorescent indicator for ROS that is oxidized in presence of reactive oxygen species to fluorescent molecule carboxy-DCF. Neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were labelled with H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and cells were immediately examined under fluorescence microscopy. The carboxy-DCF positive cells were quantitated by ImageJ software and plotted. The representative fluorescence images of SH-SY5Y cells in Figure 2A indicated that the number of carboxy-DCF positive cells (green) was significantly increased at 10 \u00b5M concentration of SsnB compared to DMSO-treated samples (*p<0.05 vs DMSO; Figure 2B). The ROS generation was observed exclusively in those SsnB treated cells which contain fragmented nuclei (blue). Similar to SH-SY5Y cells, SsnB (10 \u00b5M) significantly increased carboxy-DCF positive cells in other neuroblastoma cell lines tested (bar diagram in Figure 2B; *p<0.05 vs DMSO). In negative control, no such green staining was observed in cells processed without H2DCFDA dye ruling out the autofluorescence (data not shown). These results suggest that SsnB compound promotes intracellular ROS production in neuroblastoma cell lines. We further evaluated SsnB-induced generation of ROS by fluorometry assay. Neuroblastoma cells as treated above were incubated with H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 485 nm (excitation wavelength) and 530 nm (emission wavelength). The H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity (as measure of generation of ROS) was significantly increased in cells treated with SsnB (10 \u00b5M) compared to DMSO control (*p<0.05, SsnB 10 \u00b5M vs DMSO; Figure 2C) whereas the H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity levels were almost similar in SsnB (1 \u00b5M) and DMSO-treated cells (ns \u200a=\u200a nonsignificant, SsnB 1 \u00b5M vs DMSO; Figure 2C).",
                        "In a reaction system, after the removal of acetate group by cellular esterases and oxidation by reactive oxygen species, the non-fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA dye is oxidized to fluorescent molecule carboxy-DCF. To measure the ROS-generating activity of SsnB, we also monitored the oxidation of carboxy-H2DCFDA dye in a cell-free system containing carboxy-H2DCFDA dye, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and SsnB at 540 nm [38]. HRP was used to supply esterase since without esterase carboxy-H2DCFDA is not sensitive to oxidant. As shown in Figure 2D, the optical density (OD) value of reaction containing SsnB (10 \u00b5M) + H2DCFDA dye (25 \u00b5M) remained constant throughout the experiment suggesting that SsnB (10 \u00b5M) alone was not able to oxidize H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound carboxy-DCF. After addition of HRP (5 units/ml) in the reaction mixture containing SsnB (10 \u00b5M) + H2DCFDA dye (25 \u00b5M), the OD value increased by 2% in the first 240 sec and further increased by 8% after 15 min compared to H2DCFDA + HRP reaction, indicating the increased oxidation of H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound. These results suggest that SsnB in presence of cellular peroxidases oxidizes non-fluorescent H2DCFDA dye into the fluorescent compound. Addition of GSH (0.25 \u00b5M or 2.5 \u00b5M) in a reaction containing SsnB (10 \u00b5M) + H2DCFDA dye (25 \u00b5M) + HRP (5 units/ml) lowers the OD value in a dose dependent manner indicating that GSH as an antioxidant removes the free radicals generated by SsnB in reaction mixture which in turn inhibits the oxidation H2DCFDA dye (Figure 2E).",
                        "At cellular level, reduced glutathione (GSH) protects cells from oxidative damage resulted from increased superoxides, peroxides and free radicals [39]. Since SsnB induces oxidative stress, we asked whether SsnB affects intracellular levels of GSH in neuroblastoma cells. After treatments with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells), the cellular GSH level was measured by luminescence based glutathione assay kit. Compared to control, the GSH level was significantly decreased (\u223c40% of control) in cells treated with 10 \u00b5M SsnB (*p<0.05, SsnB 10 \u00b5M vs control; Figure 2F). However, the level of GSH at 1 \u00b5M SsnB concentration was slightly higher or equals to control levels (#p\u22640.05 vs control) suggest that at initial stage basal antioxidant mechanism trying to protect the cell against the toxic effects of SsnB. These results indicated that the GSH depletion was unable to protect neuroblastoma cells against SsnB (10 \u00b5M)-induced increased oxidative stress."

We next examined SsnB-induced DNA fragmentation in neuroblastoma cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described previously [32]. In this assay, nicked DNA is identified by the addition of fluorophore-labelled dUTPs by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to the terminal ends of damaged DNA in apoptotic cells. The TUNEL-positive cells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted. The number of TUNEL-positive cells at 10 \u00b5M concentration of SsnB were significantly higher in all neuroblastoma cells compared to control (*p<0.005 vs control; Figure 3A). The TUNEL-positive cells in SsnB (1 \u00b5M) were almost similar to DMSO-treated samples (ns \u200a=\u200a nonsignificant vs control, p>0.05). The representative fluorescence images from SH-SY5Y cells as shown in Figure 3B indicated that SsnB at 10 \u00b5M concentration induced DNA fragmentation (green), and the staining for fragmented DNA (TUNEL-positive staining, green in color) and nuclei (blue) were overlapped in a single cell (as shown in enlarged image) suggest that SsnB promotes apoptosis in these cells.

                        "At cellular level, mitochondria- or receptor (Fas/FasL)-mediated pathways activate caspase signaling cascade which in turn induces DNA damage and initiates programmed cell death (apoptosis) [40]. To determine whether SsnB-induced cell death is mediated by caspase activation, we performed Western blotting as well as immunofluorescence assay to detect active form of caspase-3 in neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). The number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted. The bar diagram in Figure 3C demonstrated that SsnB at 10 \u00b5M significantly increased the cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green) compared to DMSO or SsnB (1 \u00b5M) treated neuroblastoma cells (*p<0.005, SsnB 10 \u00b5M vs control). The representative immunofluorescence images for SH-SY5Y in Figure 3D indicated that the color intensity of cleaved caspase-3 (green) was significantly increased in SsnB-treated (10 \u00b5M) cells and the cleaved caspase-3 fluorescence signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm and did not overlap with nucleus (blue). The corresponding Western blots in Figure 3E demonstrated that the cleaved and active form of caspase-3 protein bands (17 and 19 kDa) were present in protein samples prepared from 10 \u00b5M SsnB treated cells (*p<0.005, SsnB 10 \u00b5M vs control, Figure 3E and F), while proteins samples from DMSO and SsnB (1 \u00b5M) had almost undetectable levels of cleaved caspase-3 (ns \u200a=\u200a nonsignificant, SsnB 1 \u00b5M vs control; Figure 3E and F). We further examined the activation of caspase-3 by SsnB (10 \u00b5M) at different time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 h) in SH-SY5Y cells. The presence of an active form of caspase-3 protein band (\u223c19 kDa) showed that SsnB induces cleavage of caspase-3 in these cells even as early as 6 h SsnB exposure (Figure 3G, upper panel). Thus, these data suggest that SsnB induces apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. We also observed increased expression of p53 in SsnB (10 \u00b5M) treated cells compare to DMSO-treated cells (middle panel; Figure 3G). Activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2 phase of cell cycle, hence, increased expression of p53 by SsnB suggested that p53 might also involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity in p53-containing neuroblastoma cells."

                        "The reduced cell viability, increased ROS and decreased GSH levels by SsnB indicated that depletion of glutathione may be a primary cause for the cell death. Next, we examined whether addition of N-acetylcystamine (NAC), a GSH precursor and an antioxidant, can protect neuroblastoma cells from SsnB-induced cell death [42]. To test this hypothesis, neuroblastoma cells were pretreated with NAC (0.5, 1 and 5 mM) for 1 h followed by treatment with SsnB (10 \u00b5M) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells), and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. MTT cell viability assays showed that NAC treatment suppresses SsnB-induced cell death in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 5A). SsnB (10 \u00b5M) induced neuroblastoma cell death in range of 40\u201360% (*p<0.05 vs control) whereas presence of NAC (1 mM or 5 mM) significantly increased the viability of SsnB-treated cells (#p<0.05, SsnB 10 \u00b5M alone vs SsnB 10 \u00b5M + NAC 1 or 5 mM). Next we measured the levels of ROS in SsnB-treated cells preincubated with NAC by fluorometry assay using H2DCFDA dye. NAC at 1 and 5 mM concentration significantly reduces ROS levels in SsnB (10 \u00b5M) treated neuroblastoma cells (#p<0.05, SsnB 10 \u00b5M alone vs SsnB 10 \u00b5M + NAC 1 or 5 mM; Figure 5B).

Agarose gel colony formation assay is an anchorage-independent in vitro cell transformation assay, and mimics the process of in vivo carcinogenesis [34]. Neuroblastoma cells (N-myc amplified cell, SK-N-BE(2), and N-myc nonamplified cell, SH-SY5Y) were grown in agarose in presence or absence of SsnB (1 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M) and after 45 days number of colonies were counted. The representative phase contrast images in Figure 6A showed that the size of colonies in SsnB 10 \u00b5M treated samples were significantly smaller than the control and SsnB (1 \u00b5M) treated samples.

In hanging drop assay the cells under the force of gravity and surface tension start accumulating at the bottom of the hanging drop and join together to form a spheroid. Spheroids represent an in vitro 3D tissue structure that mimics in vivo tumor tissue organization and microenvironment, and 3D culture better reflect cancer cells in their native, in vivo, environment [35]. As shown in Figure 6C and D, within 24 hour, both neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells, C; and SK-N-BE(2) cells, D) grown in hanging drop culture start aggregating at the bottom of the droplet. On day 12, the shape of the aggregates became rounder and smoother with a gradual decrease in the radius of the spheroid, and form compact cell clusters in DMSO- and SsnB (1 \u00b5M)-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells. The decrease in size is the result of higher cell\u2013cell cohesion, which yields more compact aggregates. However, at 10 \u00b5M SsnB concentration the cells are loosely attached in spheroids suggesting that SsnB at 10 \u00b5M inhibits cell-cell attachment in both cell lines (SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells) as a result these cells are unable to aggregate to form compact spheroids."

Increasing evidence supports that molecular and genetic factors such as N-myc oncogene amplification, deletion of short arm of chromosome 1 and high expression of neurotrophin receptors (TrkA and TrkB) are associated with malignant transformation and progression of neuroblastoma. Despite targeting new molecular targets, and the use of multimodal therapy which includes surgery, radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody based immunotherapy, approximately 40% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma remain incurable [23], [43], [44]. Hence, the identification and development of new therapeutic compounds with less toxicity are urgently needed.",
                "We used a novel naturally-occurring compound, Sparstolonin B (SsnB), isolated from the tubers of an aquatic Chinese herb, Sparganium stoloniferum [1]. The crude extract prepared from this herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4]\u2013[6]. In the present study SsnB at 10 \u00b5M and above concentrations significantly inhibits the growth and viability of human neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background such as N-myc amplified with wild p53 cells (IMR-32 and NGP cells), N-myc amplified with mutated p53 cells (SKN-BE(2) cell), and N-myc nonamplified cell (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells). However, the sensitivity of these cells towards SsnB is different, SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells are sensitive, NGP cells are moderate sensitive, and SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells are least sensitive (as shown by cell morphology and MTT cell viability assays in Figure 1A and B). The reduced viability by SsnB losses neuroblastoma cells ability to form compact spheroids that decreases the tumorigenic potential of both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2) cells) and N-myc nonamplified neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) tested as seen in hanging drop method and anchorage-independent colony formation assay (Figure 6). These in vitro 3-D culture results further confirmed the anti-tumorigenic activity of SsnB against human neuroblastoma. The SsnB exerts its inhibitory effects only in neuroblastoma cell lines, and up to \u223c100 \u00b5M concentration SsnB did not exhibits cytotoxicity towards various normal non-tumor human cells such as human monocytic THP-1 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells [1].",
                "The inhibitory effects of SsnB on cell growth and viability are resulted from the caspase-mediated cell death (Figure 3C\u2013F). The increased level of activated form of caspase-3 has been shown to trigger DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage that leads to the programme cell death called apoptosis [40]. The presence of apoptotic nuclei in SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells compared to control DMSO-treated cells (as revealed by TUNEL assay, Figure 3A and B) indicates that activation of caspase cascade by SsnB trigger apoptotic cell death pathways. In addition, we also found that SsnB promotes ROS generation in both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplified neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2A\u2013C). The ROS generating capacity of SsnB was confirmed by our cell-free system in which SsnB in presence of peroxidase (HRP) oxidized H2DCDA to fluorescent compound (Figure 2D and E). Reactive oxygen species such as free radicals and peroxides increases cellular oxidative stress which promotes lipids peroxidation and oxidation of nucleic acid and amplifies the cell death. The imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense status disrupt the redox homeostasis [39]. In our present study, we observed that SsnB significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) level in neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2F). GSH acts as an antioxidant and its role to remove oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species is well known hence GSH depletion in presence of SsnB fail to remove free radicals and this might be the primary cause of SsnB-induced cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The critical role of GSH in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity was further supported by our observations obtained with N-acetylcystamine (NAC). NAC is a GSH precursor and functions as an antioxidant. Co-incubation of NAC removes free radicals from the SsnB-treated cells and inhibits the activation of cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 5B\u2013D). These events thus protect the cells against the oxidative insults caused by SsnB and increased the cell viability (Figure 5A). Hence these data suggest that SsnB-induced cytotoxic effects are resulted by the excess generation of reactive oxygen species in neuroblastoma cells.",
                "The induction of cell cycle arrest at a specific checkpoint and thereby inducing apoptosis is a common mechanism for the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs [45]. The cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition is a potential target for cancer therapy as it prevents DNA-damaged cells from entering mitosis, and cell cycle blockage at this checkpoint is carried out by cell cycle-related proteins such as p53 and cyclins. Activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2 phase of cell cycle [46]. The results in present study demonstrate that treating neuroblastoma cells with SsnB (10 \u00b5M) resulted in cell cycle block in G2/M phase (flow cytometry analysis, Figure 1C) and increase in expression of p53 compared to DMSO treated cells (Figure 3G). These findings suggested that p53-mediated apoptosis might also involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity in p53-containing neuroblastoma cells.",
                "It is well known that N-myc amplification is associated with neuroblastoma tumor progression and drug resistance [41], [47]. N-myc, a member of the myc family of proto-oncoprotein, acts as a transcription factor and regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis, and overexpression of N-myc in trasnsgenic mice results in neuroblastoma development [48]. However, downregulation of N-myc expression has been shown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells [49], [50]. In the current study, we found that SsnB at 10 \u00b5M concentration suppresses the N-myc expression in IMR-32, NGP and SK-N-BE(2) cells (Figure 4) which might be correlated with the SsnB-mediated anticancer activity on human neuroblastoma cells.",
                "In summary, the present study for the first time demonstrated the anticancer property of SsnB on human neuroblastoma cells. SsnB induces apoptosis in a wide range of neuroblastoma cell lines. The reduced tumorigenic ability of both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplified cells resulted from SsnB in our colony formation and hanging drop assays, and a recent published study showing that SsnB exerts anti-angiogenic property by downregulating mRNA level of cell cycle regulatory proteins [3] indicated that SsnB can be a used as a novel therapeutics anticancer agent. Drugs that generate ROS and induce apoptosis are used alone or in combination with other therapies to treat cancer, suggesting that SsnB can be a promising antitumor agent for neuroblastoma and requires preclinical studies on animal models [51]."
