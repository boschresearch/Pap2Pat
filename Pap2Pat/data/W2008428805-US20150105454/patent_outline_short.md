# DESCRIPTION

## GOVERNMENT SUPPORT CLAUSE

- acknowledge government support

## BACKGROUND

- describe neuroblastoma

## SUMMARY

- introduce method for inhibiting neuroblastoma cells

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce Sparstolonin B (SsnB) as a therapeutic compound for neuroblastoma treatment
- describe neuroblastoma tumors and their genetic background
- discuss the structure and isolation of SsnB from Sparganium stoloniferum
- describe the inhibitory effect of SsnB on neuroblastoma cell growth and viability
- explain the mechanisms of SsnB-induced cytotoxicity, including caspase-mediated cell death and ROS generation
- discuss the effect of SsnB on cell cycle arrest and p53-mediated apoptosis
- describe the suppression of N-myc expression by SsnB and its correlation with anticancer activity
- outline methods for treatment of neuroblastoma using SsnB, including in vivo and in vitro applications
- discuss pharmaceutical compositions and delivery systems for SsnB administration

### Example 1

- describe cell culture and SsnB treatments
- perform cell viability and cell cycle analyses
- conduct immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analyses
- measure ROS generation, perform colony formation and hanging-drop assays, and analyze data
- test inhibitory effects of SsnB on neuroblastoma cell survival
- examine effects of SsnB on cell cycle progression
- investigate SsnB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species
- analyze SsnB-induced DNA fragmentation
- examine SsnB-induced activation of caspase-3
- investigate SsnB-induced reduction of N-Myc expression
- examine NAC attenuation of SsnB inhibitory effects
- test SsnB reduction of tumorigenicity of neuroblastoma cells

### Example 2

- describe cell culture
- establish in vivo xenograft neuroblastoma mouse model
- perform immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining
- analyze data and present results
