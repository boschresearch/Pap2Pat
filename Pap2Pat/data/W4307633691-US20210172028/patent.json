    "abstract": "In certain embodiments, this application discloses methods for detecting lung cancer. The method includes characterization of cells extracted from human sputum, which is a valuable tissue surrogate and source of upper respiratory cells that become cancerous early in the process of lung cancer development. The method includes the staining of extracted cells with fluorescent reporters that produce a specific pattern in the nuclei of labeled cells, which can be made visible by light microscopy. The pattern is relevant to a type of epigenetic coding of DNA known as DNA methylation, which changes in specific cells of the lung during cancer development, in comparison to normal respiratory cells.",

                        "By way of additional background, it is becoming more and more evident that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have a strong influence in the development of multi-cellular systems, in their healthy maintenance and in their structural and functional decline during aging and at an accelerated rate by diseases such as cancer, alongside with and even without the coexistence of genetic mutations. Therefore, methods for measuring DNA methylation are vital in understanding these mechanisms in efforts for combating cancers and securing healthy aging. There is no doubt that imaging, alongside with molecular techniques, is playing an indispensable role in the differential quantification of DNA methylation in cells and tissues.",
                        "Measuring changes in DNA methylation is valuable, since it correlates with early events in carcinogenesis and tumor progression, and can serve as a signature in early diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring. In this sense, the inventors' approach, as described in certain embodiments herein, to apply quantitative DNA methylation imaging for early detection of lung cancer revives the idea of in situ measuring epigenetic features such as DNA methylation in exfoliated respiratory cells for their characterization, for a cell-by-cell based pathological diagnosis.",
                        "DNA methylation imaging, which was introduced for tissue characterization towards the end of the 1990s did not gain much popularity in comparison to contemporaneously developed molecular methods, including PCR-based, array-based, sequencing, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry, for two reasons: (i) it was applied in combination with radio-labeled or enzymatic reporters for detection, which either lack sensitivity, multiplexing capability or affect repeatability/consistency of the assay, and (ii) did not provide enough significance in differential results due to low image resolution. Enormous improvements in high-resolution imaging and computational capacity within recent years have been supportive to the development of more sophisticated tools in cell-based assays that can be applied to biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. This was also a pre-requisite for the development of 3D-qDMI to revisit the concept of nondestructive imaging of large-scale changes on the higher-order chromatin structure by epigenetic reporters such global DNA methylation.",
                        "In short, the 3D-qDMI approach described herein is especially advantageous because it allows for (1) high-resolution imaging of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and global DNA (gDNA), and (2) digital extraction of three 5mC-relevant features as diagnostic signatures for early lung cancer detection: (i) the 5mC load (content), (ii) the spatial nuclear codistribution of 5mC and gDNA, and (iii) measurement of cell-population heterogeneity based on the first two 5mC features, in order to characterize respiratory epithelial cells in sputum samples (FIG. 2).",
                        "Compared to current molecular approaches and a few previous low-resolution imaging-based attempts that either average 5mC measurements across a large population of cells or only measure mean 5mC intensity values in cell nuclei, 3D-qDMI leverages the extraction of differential 5mC-relevant information by considering secondary effects of DNA methylation imbalances that occur throughout cellular transformation, especially hypomethylation of gDNA. In particular the latter mechanism elicits reorganization of the genome within cell nuclei, affecting nuclear architecture. This phenomenon is well described in basic cell biological research, but has not yet been exploited well in cancer pathology. The image analysis applied in some embodiments of the inventive method covers this gap and displays the relevant changes as intensity distribution of the two types of signals that reflect said phenomena: (a) 5mC-signals created through immunofluorescence targeting and (b) gDNA represented by DAPI-signals that are generated by subsequent counter-staining of the same cells, as DAPI intercalates into AT-rich DNA the main component of highly repetitive and compact heterochromatic sequences. Overall, the method results in images that represent maps of sputum cells with a spectrum of differential DNA methylation phenotypes (5mC/DAPI texture features) that correlate with cell morphology (epithelial and mesenchymal cell phenotypes) and growth behavior (high-proliferative cancer cells, moderately growing normal cells, and growth-arrested senescent cells).",
                        "Although lung cancer cells are one type of cancer cells that could be detected according to the methods described herein, analysis of 5mC content and/or 5mC and gDNA spatial nuclear co-distribution could be used to detect any cancer cell.",
                        "With the foregoing additional background in mind, certain specific non-limiting embodiments are described below.",
                        "In various embodiments, the invention teaches a method for determining if a cell is cancerous or precancerous. In some embodiments, the method comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of determining the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) content and/or spatial nuclear co-distribution of 5mC and global DNA (gDNA) in a nucleus of the cell; and determining that the cell is cancerous or precancerous if the 5mC content and/or spatial nuclear co-distribution of 5mC and gDNA in the nucleus of the cell is significantly different from a non-cancerous or non-precancerous reference cell and/or a non-cancerous or non-precancerous reference cell population, or determining that the cell is not cancerous or not precancerous if the 5mC content and/or spatial nuclear co-distribution of 5mC and gDNA are not significantly different from those of a non-cancerous or non-precancerous reference cell and/or a non-cancerous or non-precancerous reference cell population.

In some embodiments, it is determined that a cancerous cell or precancerous cell is not present in the biological sample if the 5mC load and/or spatial nuclear co-distribution of 5mC and gDNA are not significantly different from those of a non-cancerous or non-precancerous reference cell population and/or no cell in the biological sample is significantly different with respect to 5mC load and/or spatial nuclear co-distribution of 5mC and gDNA compared to the global pattern of the entire cell population in the biological sample.

                        "Given the significant difference in global nuclear 5mC load and distribution between pre-cancerous or cancerous cells and their normal counterparts, these differences can be visualized and measured using light microscopy in a rapid, parallel manner at single-cell resolution for the characterization of thousands of cells within biological samples. In some embodiments, the global nuclear content and relative distribution of 5mC versus global gDNA (delineated by DAPI) in sputum-derived cells and cell populations are analyzed. These nuclear entities are not static and reorganize during cellular transformation of normal healthy cells into precancerous and cancerous cells. In this context, a powerful aspect of scatter plots is their ability to depict mixture models of simple relationships between variables. These relationships can reflect cellular patterns as specific signatures, in which the variables can be nuclear structures as shown in the case of nuclear 5mC patterns versus DAPI-stained gDNA (Tajbakhsh J, Wawrowsky K A, Gertych A, Bar-Nur O, Vishnevsky E, Lindsley E H, Farkas D L).

We have shown that such reorganizations can be dynamically monitored by scatter plotting the signal distributions of global 5mC and gDNA, with their differential distribution becoming visible as changes in the plotted patterns. In other words, the 2D scatter plots represent signal frequency co-distributions of the targeted two nuclear entities, and the co-distribution plots can be considered as cell-specific signatures (See Tajbakhsh J, Wawrowsky K A, Gertych A, Bar-Nur O, Vishnevsky E, Lindsley E H, Farkas D L).

                                "In the year 2010, there were over 200,000 new cases of lung cancer reported in the United States, accounting for 15% of all new cancer cases. The estimated number of lung cancer deaths in the same period was roughly 160,000, representing \u02dc28% of all cancer-related deaths. Unfortunately, due to limited treatment options, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related mortality. If this disease is diagnosed in an early stage, a complete surgical resection of the tumor provides a favorable chance for cure. Therefore, early detection of this disease has been the focus of many attempts in the past few decades. Several trials utilizing radiographical techniques including chest X-ray, chest computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans have shown mixed results with unclear clinical benefits and harbor very high cost. As indicated above, radiographical methods for early detection of lung cancer, including chest CT scans, involve a high dose of radiation, which by itself imposes a higher risk of developing secondary malignancies if used frequently. As a result, frequent use of chest CT scans for screening lung cancer is probably not safe or economical.",
                                "Importantly, previous trials have utilized sputum cytology for early detection of lung cancer, but they mainly depended on evaluating morphological changes of exfoliated epithelial respiratory cells, and each of them failed to detect lung cancer cases to the point that could show a meaningful clinical advantage.",
                                "On the other hand, assessment of methylation status of certain genes in the sputum samples of high-risk patients has been successful in early detection of lung cancer lesions. Unfortunately, lung cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases and no uniform abnormality is identified in all cases. Equally important, the analysis of cell samples that average gene methylation status across a large number of cells may disguise the important subtle information that is specific to a smaller subgroup of cancerous cells in sputum and therefore bias the analysis results. Therefore, relying on the abnormalities of a subset of genes across all sputum cells to detect lung tumors probably may only cover a subgroup of cases. After considering the shortcomings of previously available diagnostic methods, the inventors sought to analyze the global DNA methylation status of exfoliated respiratory cells in the sputum in a cell-by-cell fashion as a tool for early detection of lung cancer.",
                                "**DNA Methylation in Cancer Diagnosis**",
                                "The perfect epigenetic equilibrium of normal cells is substantially altered when cells become transformed. The resulting epigenetic alterations at the DNA level fall into two categories: (i) gene-specific hypermethylation of CpGs in gene promoters in gene-rich genomic regions termed CpG-islands, and (ii) genome-wide hypomethylation, a large percentage of which occurs in repetitive DNA elements. Aberrant methylation patterns are associated with several cancer types. Genome-wide hypomethylation parallels closely to the degree of malignancy and is a ubiquitous finding. The analysis of DNA hypomethylation has largely remained unexploited. Cancer cell lines, widely used as research models, exhibit a large variation in genome-wide demethylation, which reflects tissue-specificity and unlikely results from stochastic processes. A malignant cell can contain 20-60% less genomic methylcytosine than its normal counterpart. The loss of methyl groups is achieved mainly by hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences, which account for more than 90% of the human genome, including transposable elements (\u02dc48% of genome) such as short and long interspersed nuclear elements (SINES and LINES, respectively), largely acquired as retroviruses throughout evolution. Global methylation is also clinically relevant, as demonstrated by associations between clinical outcome and global methylation levels in a number of cancer types. Global hypomethylation seems to be related to cancer progression, since loss of global methylation tends to become more pronounced as precancerous lesions progress. To date, differential DNA methylation analysis has been quantitatively assessed mostly by molecular approaches including electrophoretic, chromatographic, PCR-based, array-based, and sequencing technologies. Despite tremendous improvement in specificity, sensitivity, and the inherent single-base resolution of these methods, they remain technically challenging in the high-throughput analysis of single cells. These include the limitation of PCR-based approaches in multiplexing, and the challenging sensitivity and cost issues of whole-genome sequencing, especially for the interrogation of repetitive elements. Alternatively, and considering the prevalence and load of DNA methylation imbalances, especially hypomethylation of repetitive elements, imaging-based assessment of global nuclear 5mC patterns provides a powerful tool to simultaneously analyze and characterize a large number of cells, as the underlying molecular processes involve large-scale chromatin reorganization visible by light microscopy.",

The workflow of an embodiment of 3D-qDMI is illustrated in FIG. 1.",
                                "Given the large dynamic range in 5mC load and distribution, 3D-qDMI allows for the rapid, parallel, morphometric, single-cell resolution characterization of thousands of cells within heterogeneous sputum samples. The following highlights some of the advantages of 3D-qDMI applicable to using non-invasive surrogates such as sputum samples in lung cancer diagnostics and clinical decision-making: (i) 3D-qDMI does not require cellular enrichment through error-prone separation methods; (ii) the method does not require time-consuming DNA extraction and DNA amplification, (iii) 3D-qDMI provides cell-by-cell analysis; (iv) the method enables the heterogeneity assessment of cell populations, including frequency of different cell types in regards to DNA methylation features; (v) irrelevant cells can be identified and excluded from analysis, which would prevent data skewing through sample impurity by infiltrating hematopoietic cells; (vi) the cost-efficient cytometric approach can be automated and is amenable to scale, therefore can be easily developed and implemented in clinical settings. The cytometric approach can be applied to simultaneous multi-color high-content imaging. Hence, cells of interest and/or infiltrating hematopoietic cells can be additionally labeled for cell-specific markers. Subsequently, irrelevant cells can be identified in the output data and eliminated before data analysis. Furthermore, the method is compatible with using microscopic slides and Society for Biomolecular Sciences (SBS)-format microplates as a support for deposition of sputum-derived cells. Therefore, the method has the potential for implementation in the high-throughput clinical and diagnostic environment, that is routinely applying said formats for cancer diagnostics. In detail, the three steps of sample preparation, staining, and scanning can be automated with existing commercially available high-throughput instruments. Image and data analysis are computerized processes that are naturally performed in an automated fashion, and only limited by computational capacity.",

In some embodiments, the outcome of the 5mC/DAPI colocalization pattern can be represented as a scatter plot (See FIG. 2). However, one of skill in the art would readily appreciate that there are many other ways to represent this type of data.",
                                "As demonstrated in FIG. 2, 5mC features such as 5mC/DAPI colocalization patterns can vary between cells within a population. Therefore, cell population heterogeneity assessment is a valuable feature in determining the composition of the cells, i.e. the degree of phenotypic variation important for the identification of a low number of cells that may show aberrant MeC phenotypes similar to aggressive cancer cells. Homogeneity can be assessed by the comparison of structural similarity within an entire cell population by expressing a relationship between an individual nuclear 5mC/DAPI pattern and the global pattern of the entire cell population, representing the sum of all individual nuclear patterns (reference pattern).",
                                "Sputum Studies The inventors explored 3D nuclear 5mC patterns in human upper respiratory cells derived from the sputum of a healthy individual (non-smoker with no history of cancer), as well as sputum cells from a lung cancer patient (smoker) and matching tissue specimen, as well as three human cell lines. Cell lines included the immortalized normal human epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B), and the NSCLC lines A549 (alveolar basal epithelial cells) and H157 (highly invasive lung carcinoma cells). FIG. 4 shows normal parenchyma and the tumoral region of a fluorescently labeled section from a newly diagnosed, surgically resected lung cancer. The inventors observed common global DNA methylation patterns amongst healthy cells that significantly differ from the 5mC/DAPI patterns of cancerous cells and abnormal sputum cells from the cancer patient (FIG. 5) that were significantly globally hypomethylated. All populations of the three different cell lines and sputum-derived cells, as well as the normal tissue, showed a high degree of homogeneity (visualized through KL category maps) in terms of their 5mC/DAPI codistributions, displayed as scatter plots on the cell population level and for individual representative nuclei.",
                                "The inventors have introduced a measureable descriptor of each cell type (FIG. 5): the regression line of the plot and the upper and lower signal borderlines ML1 and ML2 are characteristic and determine the four angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 for each prototypic cell type. The resulting differential factor F=[(\u03b1/\u03b3)\u00d7(\u03b2/\u03b4)] is specific to each cell type: 0.54 (BEAS-2B), 0.42 (A549), 0.12 (H157), 0.78 (typical normal tissue cells), 0.45 (cells of normal sputum), 0.44 (majority of N1-type cells in sputum of cancer patient), 0.01 (N2-type cell in sputum of cancer patient), and 0.05 (typical cancer tissue cells). This measure underlines the differentiating power of global methylation patterns for detection of normal and malignant cells. Especially the resemblance between (N2-type) cell signatures in cancer-patient sputum and typical tumor tissue cells can play a central role in detecting abnormal cells in sputum samples, early in the process of tumorigenesis. The observations demonstrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 that 3D nuclear DNA methylation patterns serve as a novel biomarker for the non-invasive detection of malignant cells of the respiratory tract. In some aspects, the inventive method utilizes 3D-qDMI to determine differential global DNA methylation patterns of exfoliated respiratory cells in a sputum sample of individuals with higher risk for developing lung cancer. Specifically, each sputum cell population can be characterized by the statistics of determined F-factors that provide an estimation of the cell composition, which could facilitate the detection of malignant cells.",

These degrees can be associated with particular ranges of KL divergences such as: similar KL\u2208[0,0.5), likely similar KL\u2208[0.5,2), unlikely similar KL\u2208[2,4.5), and dissimilar for KL\u2208[4.5,\u221e) (FIG. 3).",
