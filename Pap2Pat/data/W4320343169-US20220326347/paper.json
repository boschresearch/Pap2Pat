    "title": "Multi-objective Design of Uniform Sparse MIMO Arrays",
    "date": "2022-10-20",
    "abstract": "The problem of multi-objective design of sparse MIMO arrays for better multitarget detection capabilities is considered. A novel approach for efficient utilization of the antenna design resources; namely, the number of available array elements, and array aperture are studied for the angular beamforming performance metrics such as, beam width, the peak to sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and grating lobe limited field of view. The limiting constraints, the physical size of elements, and mutual coupling are also considered. Thinning of fully populated uniform MIMO antenna arrays to form effective uniform sparse arrays (USA), as the term proposed here, are examined as for their capability of improving usable field of view (uFOV), beamwidth (BW), and peak-to-side lobe-ratio (PSLR) using fewer physical antenna elements, simultaneously. Sparse arrays require much less array elements to outperform uniform linear (ULA) and rectangular arrays (URA) for their beamwidths. Further, a rigorious design procedure considering the physical size limitations is currently unavailable. Here, we present a practical design architecture of such a uniform sparse array under multiple contradicting objectives. Angular resolution performances of the novel uniform sparse arrays are compared with the standard ULA and URAs. It is shown that design of an array with small inter-element spacings avoiding any grating lobes is possible even when the physical size of the elements are very large. Expanding the available elements to a much larger apertures provides much better angular resolution. However, it is also shown that these advantages come with the cost of increased side lobes. Both the simulated and the measured results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed uniform sparse array design compared to classical fully populated uniform arrays.",

                "Sensor arrays play an important role in spatio-temporal signal processing with applications spanning across multiple fields such as electromagnetic, acoustics, ultrasonic and seismic processing systems. Fundamental technology used in some of those applications includes radar, sonar, navigation, wireless communications, electronic surveillance and radio astronomy [1][2][3]. By exploiting the diverse waveform from its multiple antennas, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar transmits a probing waveform that can be chosen at will to maximize the power around areas of interest. Antenna pattern design for MIMO radar has become a popular research topic in recent years [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. There is a vast amount of applications in signal processing and communication systems where the discrete signal samples are sparse in some domain such as time, frequency, or space. However, novel methods seem to outperform conventional techniques, regarding both complexity and optimality [9].",
                "Sparse antenna array has several advantages in the high resolution thinned configurations for phased array radar and MIMO radar. However, because of array thinning, the side lobe level increases and subsequently leads to the grating lobe [4]. In this case, maintaining the approximation performance and preventing the grating lobe present two major challenges for a MIMO radar with sparse antenna arrays [1, 4, and 10].",
                "Each field has developed similar tools, algorithms, and reconstruction methods for sparse signal processing which are; sampling: random sampling of bandlimited signals, compressed sensing (CS) [11], channel Estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) [11][12][13], and finally the calibration for the mutual couping between antenna elements [14][15][16][17][18].",
                "In this work, without any loss of generality our focus is on automotive radars, for which in the last few years it have been transformed from being a niche sensor to becoming standard even in middle-class cars. With Euro-NCAP ratings now requiring automated braking and pedestrian safety functionality, radar is often identified as the best suited sensor for this purpose. A selection of technology trends addressing some common requirements can be found in [19, and 20] The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we derive the MIMO radar system model and extend the radiation and receiving mechanism of a radar formulated for sparse arrays. In Section III, classical Fourier based steering matrix formulation is derived for sparse arrays. In Section IV, multi-objective design and optimization of a sparse MIMO array is studied. Performance parameter definitions, smart initialization for fast convergence and minimization of mutual coupling effects are proposed. Finally, results and conclusions are drawn in Section V. Performance of the method is illustrated on four uniform sparse arrays, namely, AnkaraA/B and CoruhA/B arrays, and interesting directions for future work are pointed out."

Each receiver (RX) correlates with each TX signal, producing a number of correlated outputs equal to the product of the number of RXs with the number of TXs. The outputs are deemed to have been produced by a number of virtual receivers (VRXs), which can exceed the number of physical RXs.",

However, for field angles retreating from the main lobe moving along one of the axes, these phase differences with respect to the array center begin to rotate for the furthest elements the fastest. First null occurs when the two elements furthest to the array center are out-of phase with respect to this center by approximately \u00b1 yielding the first minimum. Those far elements are W -1 /2 meters away from the array center with a phase difference of \u00b1oe g W -1 the first null is observed approximately at \u00b1 sin b 1/ g W -1 radians, respectively. This approximation is accurate within 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 degrees for W = 15, 18, 25, and 35, respectively. Retreating further from the broadside angle while furthest elements' phase rotations turning back to in-phase, we observe the second to the last elements to be approximately out-of phase creating the second minimum. In this narrow angular region bounded by those two minima all except the last two elements are mostly in-phase causing the largest side lobe. Side lobes gradually decrease due to increasing incoherence between the elements until we reach the half way to the first grating lobe. For an odd numbered ULA all radiations cancel each other completely leaving the only one in the center to yield the minimum side lobe level of 1/W. This phenomenae occurs independent of the number of elements or their spacings, and this first side lobe sets the PSLR approximately to -13.8 dB. Fig. 4.

Due to the irregularity of sparse element positions we expect more than just two elements to be out of phase away from the main lobe as illustrated in Fig. 4. In-phase interactions between elements become rapidly incoherent yielding a much smaller beamwidth. However, due to the conservation of radiated power the side lobes cannot be supressed but spread across the half-hemisphere, or can be optimized to be pushed outside of a given FOV. Grating lobes occur at angles when all of the array elements are perfectly in-phase, and they are constructively contributing to the received signal pattern equivalent to the main lobe. Large side lobes, however, are not grating lobes, they require only the complex sum of all the contributions to be comparatively large, allowing some inter-element phase mismatching, and even some distructive interferences between the elements.",

For an element width of two wavelengths azimuthal uFOV is approximately limited to 14.48 degrees as shown in Table I.

Thus, for given FOV and W, BW improvement is not possible with uniform linear and rectangular arrays. This is due to the fact that required FOV and BW values are sufficient to determine the size of the fully populated aperture and which could well be over the practical limits. Additional requirements for a specific implementation becomes even more stringent once the physical size of elements and the mutual coupling constraints are also to be considered. Therefore there is a need for an efficient way to design and construct TX/RX arrays utilizing thinning of arrays, and allowing larger apertures with much less elements, hopefully without receding the first two constraints considerably.",

Initial simulations for mutual couplings can provide insight about some horizontal and vertical separation distances, \" O , , and \" O , for the two axes to keep those coupling under some threshold. Physical and virtual element sharing of a previously designed array would enforce some positions as an initial value for the optimization (See Table II.)

Secondly, element positions need to be optimized for smaller PSLR. For a large side lobe overall in-phase contributions are expected to be large, and this generally occurs when the frequency of a certain inter-element spacing value is much higher than others. Thus, large side lobes can be spread across the half-hemisphere by setting the spacing values to be irregular (Table II). However, the total radiated power being conserved the overall sidelobe levels are expected to rise. PSLR reduction becomes possible when the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) is forced to a smooth. One can initialize the spacing values by forcing their ECDF to be linear (uniform distribution) as proposed below.",

This also yields a linear ECDF, \u00c0 \u00c1 = = -3 + 2 = /h /4. No grating lobes are expected since the ECDF is smooth, and the positions are located on a uniform grid size of h/2. Please note that in both examples a random shuffling of the spacing ordering will change the element positions but not the ECDF. Each alternative configuration will yield to a different signal-return pattern. This requires search iterations for the optimum spacing ordering for the best PSLR. Similar to the second example, let us now set \" g = 10. We can recalculate \u0394 = h/3, and spacings are given by 3 = /h = {6, 7, 8, 9} with element positions, 3# = /h = {0, 6, 13, 21, 30} which do not coincide with the reference grid points. For a general sparse array there is no constraint on the element positions as proposed in Table II. However, a 'uniform' sparse array (USA), by definition which is proposed in this paper, requires all of its element positions to be in some uniform grid space. For this third example, we can change the reference grid size to h/3, or move the elements to some neighboring grid points without causing any overlapping. Both will provide the first group of initial array candidates for the optimization search. Element positions can further be perturbed further to move around the grids finding a better 'local optimum' PSLR value as described in Table II. The ECDF for the optimum spacings is expected to be a smooth function with minimal repetitive spacing values to spread the grating lobes into side lobes. Numerical examples of the ECDF are given Fig. ECDF in Section V."

The inter-element spacings for ULAs are constant as shown in Fig. 13 (a) for W = 16 and 64 which need to be h/2 or smaller in order to provide a grating lobe-free operation. However, when the physical size of elements are larger than this value the received signal pattern for ULAs will be the sum of all image replicas for each real-valued grating lobe angles at sin b V/2\u00ac shifted along the azimuth. Similarly for URAs, additional replica images will be added for each realvalued grating lobes at sin b V/2\u210e shifted along the elevation as discussed in (29).
