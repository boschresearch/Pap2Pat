The exemplary radar system uses sparsely located antenna array elements allowing improved FOV, angular resolution, beam width, and side lobes using fewer physical antenna elements. Sparse antenna arrays allow the use of physically larger elements, larger separation between transmitter and receiver elements to reduce mutual coupling, and fewer elements to reduce necessary computations.",

A radar system can also estimate the velocity of the target by Doppler processing. A radar system with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers (MIMO: Multi-Input Multi-Output) can also determine the angular position of a target.

The transmitted signal is reflected off of object or targets in the environment. The received signal at each receiver is the totality of the reflected signal from all targets in the environment. The receiver downconverts the received signal to baseband and compares the baseband received signal to the baseband signal at one or more transmitters.

SLL is always constant for full-grid arrays and cannot be changed without using tapering.",

For faster convergence, initial values offered in step 806 can be used here before random perturbation of locations. Perturbations are shifting of elements by multiples of minimum-inter-element spacing.",

In step 805, optimum positions and SLL values for each run are monitored. Step 805 continues back to step 802 for another run if the last two SLL values are different enough. After a sufficient number of runs (e.g., a minimum of 5), the last two optimum SLL values are monitored. If their difference is lower than significance (an exemplary value of 0.5 decibels), the algorithm/method's outer (right) iteration loop is stopped. This finalizes all iterations.
