                        "When an organ is damaged in order to maintain the integrity of the physiological and morphological state, the tissue must repair. The regenerative potential of an organ relates to the ability of the cells within that tissue to restore original tissue architecture post damage. Some organs have low regenerative potential and when damaged replace tissue with connective tissue that causes subsequent scarring. Certain organs, tissues and cells of the body are more capable of cellular proliferation (and hence regeneration) than others (Krafts, 2010). Broadly, organs can be separated into three categories based on their regenerative potential (Kotton and Morrisey, 2014). First, organs such as the intestine, skin and hematopoietic system that show high levels of cellular turnover and require a dedicated undifferentiated stem cell population to replace dead or sloughed-off cells. These tissues have enormous proliferative and self-renewing capacity. Second, quiescent tissues such as the liver, lung and pancreas respond with a proliferative burst after injury to replace lost cells (Kotton and Morrisey, 2014). Third, non-dividing tissues such as the central nervous system (CNS) and heart regenerate poorly or not at all after injury. These tissues are for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. Much research is devoted to developing technologies and techniques to aid or promote healing when organs are damaged.",
                        "There are \u02dc23 million heart failure patients worldwide, a condition for which there is currently no cure and current treatments only slow disease progression. The initiating cause of most instances of heart failure is a loss of cardiomyocytes, which are never replenished due to the low intrinsic regenerative capacity of the adult heart (Porrello et al., 2011; Porrello and Olson, 2014). Likewise, nervous system injuries affect over 90,000 people every year (Stabenfeldt et al., 2006). Traumatic injury to the CNS causes cell death and, for the most part, the CNS is incapable of regeneration of these lost cells. Control of neuron regeneration is both a major unmet medical need and an unsolved problem in neurobiology (Mahar and Cavalli, 2018). The failure of damaged adult CNS axons to regrow results in permanent disabilities for individuals with spinal cord injury or stroke (Mahar and Cavalli, 2018) which has enormous socio-economic impact. Furthermore, many diseases for example, multiple sclerosis, could be alleviated by regeneration of the CNS.",
                        "Regeneration of cells is essentially mediated via genetic regulation and the identification of factors that are capable of re-activating proliferation in adult tissue has become a promising avenue of research. While a variety of different factors can increase proliferation, the effects on regeneration have been modest (Leach et al., 2017; Mohamed et al., 2018; Nakada et al., 2017). Therefore, further understanding the cell intrinsic mechanisms of regeneration of these non-dividing cells is imperative if innate regenerative capacity is to be harnessed.",
                        "Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factor that binds preferentially to specific sequences in the genome, termed E-boxes (Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991), via association with its bHLH-LZ heterodimerisation partner Max (Amati et al., 1993, 1992; Blackwood et al., 1992). Myc functions principally as a transcriptional activator by potentiating transcription initiation via association with various cofactors such as TRRAP and associated histone acetyl-transferases (Bouchard et al., 2001; McMahon et al., 1998) and facilitating productive transcriptional elongation by promoting RNA PolII loading and via its association with positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) (De Pretis et al., 2017; Eberhardy and Farnham, 2002; Kanazawa et al., 2003; Rahl et al., 2010). P-TEFb is comprised of Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 which are stringently regulated by various transcriptional and post transcriptional mechanisms (Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Peterlin and Price, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhou and Yik, 2006), and dynamically controlled by an association with inactivation complex comprised of 7SK snRNA, Larp7, MEPCE and HEXIM (Barboric et al., 2005; He et al., 2008; Yik et al., 2003). P-TEFb phosphorylates Serine 2 of the C-terminal Domain (CTD) of paused RNA PolII leading to productive elongation (Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Peterlin and Price, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhou and Yik, 2006).",
                        "Myc is a highly pleiotropic transcription factor which coordinates multiple transcriptional programmes involved in cell replication and differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis (Amati et al., 1993; Dang, 2013; Eilers et al., 1991; Evan et al., 1992; Roussel et al., 1991). With the development of animal models allowing for switchable ectopic Myc expression in vivo, it has become evident that Myc also governs diverse cell extrinsic processes required for tissue regeneration\u2014such as angiogenesis, modulation of the local inflammatory and immune responses, invasion and migration\u2014but in a manner that is tightly tailored to the tissue in which Myc is activated (Kortlever et al., 2017; Shchors et al., 2006; Sodir et al., 2011). Since deregulated and elevated Myc expression is a pervasive and causal attribute of most, perhaps all, tumours, understanding how tissue-specific responses to Myc are determined at a molecular level is imperative.",
                        "Comprehensive analysis of Myc transcriptional output in individual cell types indicates that Myc regulates the expression of thousands of genes, perhaps as much as a third of the transcriptome. Such studies show great diversity across experimental platforms and hint that components of the transcriptional repertoire of Myc are highly context specific. In particular, genome-wide analysis of Myc occupancy indicates the presence of Myc on virtually all promoters with open chromatin, suggesting that tissue-specific variations in Myc activity result from specific, pre-existing resident cellular programmes. However, this large and diverse number of potential Myc target genes, and the lack of comparative analysis of transcriptional responses to Myc in different tissues, have together confounded reliable identification of common and tissue-specific Myc-dependent transcriptional programmes. Moreover, recruitment of Myc to a given gene does not always correlate with its level of transcription and binding efficiency and transcriptional outputs are influenced significantly by different levels of Myc expression. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Myc is a selective transcription factor that regulates a defined set of core genes across multiple tissues, and others that are tissue-specific",
                        "As discussed above, there is a need to understand the intrinsic cellular mechanisms of regeneration or lack of in non-dividing cells, and moreover, a need to be able to influence these mechanisms such that the regenerative potential of these cells can be re-established. The present invention addresses this need."

                        "Using a reversibly switchable mouse model in which supraphysiological levels of Myc are expressed comparably across different tissues we have determined that there are three general classes of response to activation of oncogenic levels of Myc: tissues that proliferated in response to the activation of ectopic Myc; tissues that did not; and tissues that exhibited innately high endogenous Myc and proliferative indices. The correlation between proliferative response to ectopic Myc in these tissues and the innate regenerative potential of each tissue is striking and suggests an underlying mechanistic connection. We have further determined that tissue regenerative capacity is tightly linked to the capacity of that tissue to respond to Myc and that tissue Myc responsiveness is governed principally by availability of key components of the core transcriptional machinery, namely p-TEFb, which Myc co-opts to drive its regenerative biological output. As such, we have determined that increasing the expression and/or activity of at least one, preferably both of Myc and p-TEFb, can increase or rather re-establish regenerative proliferation in adult tissues without proliferative potential. Where we refer to p-TEFb herein is meant cyclin T1 and/or cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9).",

During translation, when the ribosome encounters a ribosomal skipping sequence it is prevented from creating the peptide bond with the last proline in the ribosomal skipping sequence. As a result, translation is stopped, the nascent polypeptide is released and translation is re-initiated to produce a second polypeptide. This results in the addition of a C-terminal ribosomal skipping sequence (or the majority of such a sequence) to the first polypeptide chain, and an N-terminal proline to the next polypeptide. Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises at least one ribosomal skipping sequence. In one example, the ribosomal skipping sequence is a 2A-like peptide, such as P2A (comprising ATNFSLLKQAGDVEENPGP, SEQ ID NO: 26), E2A (comprising QCTNYALLKLAGDV ESNPGP, SEQ ID NO: 27) or F2A (comprising VKQTLNFDLLKLAGDVESNPGP, SEQ ID NO: 28).

After the polycistronic gene is transcribed by endogenous transcriptional machinery, the endonucleases RNAse P and RNAse Z (or RNAse E in bacterium) recognise and specifically cleave the tRNAs at specific sites at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, releasing mature RNAs and tRNAs. Advantageously, tRNAs and their processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms and therefore this method can be used in all known species. In particular, this technology can allow for the production of multiple excised mature gRNAs which can direct Cas9 to multiple targets, wherein the polycistronic gene contains tandemly arrayed tRNA-gRNA units, where each gRNA contains a target-specific spacer and a conserved gRNA scaffold (see Xie et al, 2015).

Alterations in a nucleic acid sequence or ribonucleic acid sequence that result in the production of a different amino acid at a given site that does not affect the functional properties of the encoded polypeptide are well known in the art. For example, a codon for the amino acid alanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, may be substituted by a codon encoding another less hydrophobic residue, such as glycine, or a more hydrophobic residue, such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine. Similarly, changes which result in substitution of one negatively charged residue for another, such as aspartic acid for glutamic acid, or one positively charged residue for another, such as lysine for arginine, can also be expected to produce a functionally equivalent product. Nucleotide changes which result in alteration of the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the polypeptide molecule would also not be expected to alter the activity of the polypeptide. Each of the proposed modifications is well within the routine skill in the art, as is determination of retention of biological activity of the encoded products.",

                                "Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factor that binds preferentially to specific sequences in the genome, termed E-boxes (Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991), via association with its bHLH-LZ heterodimerisation partner Max (Amati et al., 1993, 1992; Blackwood et al., 1992). Myc functions principally as a transcriptional activator by potentiating transcription initiation via association with various cofactors such as TRRAP (Bouchard et al., 2001; McMahon et al., 1998) and facilitating productive transcriptional elongation by promoting RNA PolII loading and via its association with positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) (De Pretis et al., 2017; Eberhardy and Farnham, 2002; Kanazawa et al., 2003; Rahl et al., 2010). P-TEFb is comprised of Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 which are stringently regulated by various transcriptional and post transcriptional mechanisms (Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Peterlin and Price, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhou and Yik, 2006), and dynamically controlled by an association with inactivation complex comprised of 7SK snRNA, Larp7, MEPCE and HEXIM (Barboric et al., 2005; He et al., 2008; Yik et al., 2003). P-TEFb phosphorylates Serine 2 of the C-terminal Domain (CTD) of paused RNA PolII leading to productive elongation (Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Peterlin and Price, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhou and Yik, 2006).",
                                "Max is also the heterodimerisation partner of the Mxd family of transcription factors that act principally as transcriptional repressors through their interactions with HDASC2, SMC3 and Sin3A (Diolaiti et al., 2015). Since Mxd/Max heterodimers bind sites overlapping with Myc/Max and act as transcriptional repressors, it has been suggested that competition for Max by Myc versus Mxd proteins dictates transcriptional outputs at bound targets (Ayer et al., 1993; Kretzner et al., 1992).",
                                "Myc is a highly pleiotropic transcription factor which coordinates multiple transcriptional programmes involved in cell replication and differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis (Amati et al., 1993; Dang, 2013; Eilers et al., 1991; Evan et al., 1992; Roussel et al., 1991). With the development of animal models allowing for switchable ectopic Myc expression in vivo, it has become evident that Myc also governs diverse cell extrinsic processes required for tissue regeneration\u2014such as angiogenesis, modulation of the local inflammatory and immune responses, invasion and migration\u2014but in a manner that is tightly tailored to the tissue in which Myc is activated (Kortlever et al., 2017; Shchors et al., 2006; Sodir et al., 2011). Since deregulated and elevated Myc expression is a pervasive and causal attribute of most, perhaps all, tumours, understanding how tissue-specific responses to Myc are determined at a molecular level is imperative.",
                                "To determine how tissue-specificity controls the output of Myc activity, we generated a versatile, reversibly switchable mouse model in which supraphysiological levels of Myc are expressed comparably across different tissues. Using this model, we assessed Myc target gene binding and expression in distinct tissues at just 4 hours post activation of Myc. This short time scale limits any confounding normalization issues that might arise from global RNA amplification as well as avoids indirect gene expression changes coming from secondary transcriptional activation. This unique in vivo model allows us to identify essential differences between tissues in which Myc drives proliferation and tissues that exhibit no such proliferative response.",

                                "The Capacity of Myc to Drive Proliferation is Tissue-Restricted",
                                "To compare the responses of different tissues to the acute activation of a similar level of Myc, we generated a mouse strain in which supraphysiological levels of the switchable Myc protein c-MycERT2 are ubiquitously expressed from a common promoter at comparable levels across tissues. In this knock-in mouse strain, the R26LSL-c-MycER locus (R26MER) (Murphy et al., 2008) is modified to include a CAG (chicken beta actin/CMV) enhancer to augment MycERT2 expression (FIG. 8a). Such R26CAG-LSL-c-MycERT2 mice were crossed into the Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw strain in which Cre is active in the growing oocyte, effectively excising the LSL stop cassette from all adult tissues in the resultant R26CMER mice (De Vries et al., 2000). Compared with the physiological level of Myc expressed in R26MER/+ cells (heterozygous for the R26MER allele)(Murphy et al., 2008), R26CMER/+ cells express around 8-fold higher levels of MycERT2 RNA (FIG. 8b) in each tissue tested. R26CAG-LSL-MER and R26LSL-MER mice were interbred to generate an allelic series of ascending levels of MycERT2 expression (R26+/+, R26LSL-MER/+, R26LSL-MER/LSL-MER, R26CAG-LSL-MER/+, R26CAG-LSL-MER/LSL-MER and R26CAG-LSL-MER/CAG-LSL-MER). To measure directly relative levels of MycERT2 in this allelic series, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from each strain and the LSL stop cassette excised by infection in vitro with a Cre expressing Adenovirus to engage constitutive MycERT2 expression. Western blot analysis of cell lysates confirmed an ascending allelic series of MycERT2 expression with homozygous R26MER and R26CMER cells expressing twice the level of their respective heterozygous counterparts (FIG. 1a). This allelic expression series was precisely mirrored in tissues from heterozygous and homozygous R26CMER mice (FIG. 8c).",
                                "To rule out the possibility that high levels of Myc might modulate the Rosa26 promoter\u2014and hence elicit artifactual feedback effects\u2014we crossed R26CMER mice to mice carrying a R26mTmG (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo) reporter allele (Muzumdar et al., 2007). Systemic activation of MycERT2 in R26CAG/mTmG mice had no impact on expression of either Tomato or MycERT2 transcripts in any tested tissues (FIG. 8d). Hence, elevated MycERT2 activity does not modulate activity of the Rosa26 promoter.",
                                "We next determined whether acute activation of MycERT2 elicits a proliferative response in tissues of R26CMER/+ mice. MycERT2 was activated for twenty-four hours by systemic administration of tamoxifen (Wilson et al., 2014) and proliferation assessed by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67, BrdU and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (p-H3). We observed a consistent pattern of proliferative responses to supraphysiological Myc in tissues (FIGS. 1b and c) that fell into three general classes: 1. Adult tissues such as liver, lung and pancreas with normally low levels of endogenous Myc (FIG. 1d) but capable of significant regeneration after injury. Such tissues showed a marked induction of proliferation upon Myc activation. 2. Adult tissues, such as kidney, heart and brain, with normally low levels of endogenous Myc and a limited capacity to regenerate, demonstrated only a negligible rise in proliferation. 3. Tissues with constitutively high proliferative rates and substantial constitutive levels of endogenous Myc (FIG. 1d), such as thymus and spleen, in which activation of ectopic Myc elicited no significant additional proliferation above the already high basal level. Neither sustaining MycERT2 activation for three days nor increasing the expression of MycERT2 from 1 to 2 copies of R26CMER changed the proliferative responses to Myc in any tissue (FIG. 8e to h). Hence, different tissues harbour different inherent sensitivities to Myc-driven proliferation. Of note, quantification of the broad proliferative marker Ki67 revealed a small but significant increase in some cells within the heart in response to global Myc activation. However, these changes were confined to non-cardiomyocytes.",
                                "Target Genes and Tissue Specificity of Myc Binding is Dictated at the Chromatin Level",
                                "There are several plausible explanations for the failure of acute Myc activation to induce a proliferative response in tissues such as heart and brain. First, non-responsive tissues might express high levels of one or more of the Mxd proteins, which could directly antagonise Myc's transcriptional function by sequestering Max and/or competing for its binding to shared target genes. To investigate this possibility, we determined the levels of Mxd expression in various tissues. Although expression of Mxd family members varied across tissues, we saw no correlation between the extent of Myc-induced proliferation and the levels of Mxd transcripts. Next, we determined whether Myc is still able to bind its target genes using ChIP-sequencing analysis of Myc binding sites 4 hours after activation in exemplar responsive (liver) and non-responsive (heart) tissue. We observed a dramatic increase in gene occupancy upon MycERT2 activation in both tissues, from a few hundred sites in wild-type control, reflecting the low levels of endogenous Myc expression in these tissues to \u02dc30,000 after Myc activation (FIG. 2a). Hence, the failure of the heart to proliferate in response to Myc activation cannot be attributed to the inability of ectopic Myc to access its target genes. Around a quarter of Myc target binding sites were common to both tissues, with a significant overlap principally at promoter elements (FIGS. 2b and c). Motif analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for the E-box consensus sequences at these regions (FIG. 2d) and gene ontology indicated that these overlapping promoter binding sites located to \u2018classic\u2019 core Myc-dependent genes implicated in control of gene expression, mRNA processing and mitotic cell cycle (FIG. 2d). In addition to these common targets, however, Myc also bound discrete sets of promoter elements that differed between the two tissues (FIG. 2b). These tissue-specific sites were also enriched for E-box consensus sequences but demonstrated a generally lower affinity for Myc in comparison to the common core elements (FIGS. 2e and f). Interestingly, these tissue-specific promoter elements were associated with genes whose expression defines each tissue (i.e. hepatocytes versus cardiomyocytes respectively\u2014FIGS. 2e and f), consistent with the idea that Myc binds already active/open promoters. Myc ChIP-seq profiles, RNA Polymerase II (P0111) ChIP-seq in normal liver and heart, ATAC-seq in purified cardiomyocytes, publicly available data for chromatin marks of active transcription (H3K27 acetylation H3K4 tri-methylation and H3K4 mono-methylation) and DNAse-seq in heart and liver all concurred that Myc binding closely overlaps with transcriptionally active promoter and distal elements in each tissue. This holds true across both common and tissue-specific Myc-bound sites. For example, promoters bound in the heart but not liver are characterised by absence of active chromatin marks and PolII binding in the liver. Conversely, promoters bound by Myc only in liver lack active chromatin marks or associated PolII in heart (FIGS. 2g and h). To confirm Myc binding to genes implicated in the transcriptional control of cell cycle in the heart, liver and purified cardiomyocytes, we performed sub analysis of Myc binding and open chromatin marks in mitotic cell cycle gene set (GO: 0000278). Over 60% of these sites were marked as open and Myc bound (FIG. 2i). These data confirm that Myc binds \u201copen\u201d chromatin at both promoters and distal sites (enhancers) and that the disposition of chromatin accessibility is preconfigured in a tissue-specific way. Furthermore, the data indicate that adult terminally differentiated heart retains an open chromatin architecture at sites required for Myc to drive transcriptional control of proliferation and that the regenerative capacity of the heart is lost due to transcriptional control rather than an epigenetic block.",
                                "Myc Binding to Target Genes does not Necessarily Correlate with their Efficient Transcription",
                                "Since Myc efficiently binds target gene DNA in both heart and liver, we investigated other potential mechanism(s) that might limit proliferative output in the non-responsive heart. We first determined the overall transcriptional output in various tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung) of R26CMER/+ and R26+/+ control mice following acute Myc activation for 4 hours. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were called in each tissue based on the fold-change (FC) in mRNA levels between R26CMER/+ and R26+/+ control mice (Log 2FC\u22650.5, q\u22640.05). In agreement with previous observations (Kress et al., 2015; Sab\u00f2 et al., 2014; Walz et al., 2014; Zeller et al., 2006), the total number of DEGs in each tissue (FIG. 3a) was much lower than the number of Myc-bound promoters, albeit with significant inclusive overlap (FIG. 3b). Comparison of DEGs in the liver, lung, kidney and heart indicated considerable commonality amongst up-regulated genes (FIG. 3c) implicated in core Myc-regulated processes such as ncRNA, rRNA and tRNA, metabolic processes (FIG. 3d). By contrast, Myc repressed genes showed very little overlap across tissues, although gene ontology analysis did suggest that genes overlapping in 2 or more organs favoured involvement in negative regulation of cell movement, locomotion and migration (FIGS. 3e and f). Tissue-specific genes down-regulated by Myc showed significant overlap with genes normally expressed within that tissue, (FIG. 3g) and their functions were generally associated with differentiated tissue-specific processes (FIG. 3h).",
                                "Remarkably, DEG numbers also correlated well with each tissue's proliferative response to MycERT2 (FIG. 3a, FIGS. 1b and c): tissues with the lowest overall transcriptional changes displayed the least proliferative responses. However, while activation of ectopic Myc induced significant transcriptional changes to a greater number of target genes in liver than in heart, quantitative analysis of the RNA showed that most of the mRNAs that were induced in liver also exhibited modest, but non-significant, responses in the heart (FIG. 3i). Indeed, gene-set enrichment analysis in the heart confirmed a significant trend in the increased expression of common Myc targets, even when defined as targets commonly upregulated in response to Myc in all tissues excluding the heart (FIG. 3j). Hence, the transcriptional response to activation of ectopic Myc in the heart is not absent but highly attenuated and below that required to initiate cell proliferation. This refractoriness of the heart transcriptome to Myc remained evident even after prolonged (24 hours) Myc activation or in response to very high Myc levels (homozygous R26CMER mice).",
                                "Productive Myc Transcriptional Output is Limited by Availability of Transcriptional Cofactors",
                                "The most plausible explanation for our data is that the attenuated transcriptional and biological response to Myc in heart is due to either active transcriptional inhibition and/or insufficiency of requisite transcriptional co-factors or machinery. Consistent with this, both the total and phosphorylated levels of the C terminal domain of RNA PolII (Rpb1) were much lower in non-responsive heart and kidney than in Myc-responsive tissues such as the liver and lung (FIG. 4a). Since recruitment of P-TEFb is necessary for transcriptional elongation, we next assessed the expression levels of the components of P-TEFb\u2014CDK9 and CyclinT1. Both CDK9 and CyclinT1 proteins were present at considerably lower levels in the heart and kidney compared with lung or liver, along with components of the pause factors NELF and DSIF (FIGS. 4a and b). Conversely, Larp7, a negative regulator of P-TEFb, was relatively more abundant in the heart and kidney, as was the 7SK short non-coding RNA that serves as the scaffold for the P-TEFb inactivation complex (FIGS. 4a and c). This intimated that the inability of Myc to elicit transcriptional changes in the heart arises from a tissue-specific deficiency in core transcriptional cofactors, such as P-TEFb and RNA PolII itself, which are required for efficient transcriptional initiation and elongation. To determine in vitro if P-TEFb was limiting Myc driven transcription we purified adult cardiomyocytes from R26CMER/++ mice and overexpressed Ccnt1 with an Adeno virus carrying Ccnt1. Ectopic over-expression of Cyclin T1 in adult R26CMER/+ cardiomyocytes in vitro efficiently abrogated their normal refractoriness to Myc and permitted efficient expression of Myc target genes which were previously shown to be unresponsive in the adult heart (Bzw2, Pinx1, Polr3d, St6 and Cdc25a) (FIG. 5a to d). Together, these data support the notion that transcriptional activity of Myc is limited by P-TEFb availability.",
                                "Given the finding that Larp7 and the 7SK short non-coding RNA were relatively more abundant in the heart and kidney, this suggests that either or both of these may be alternative targets for therapy. For example, we hypothesise that a Larp7 knockdown (for example, via RNAi or CRISPR) could replace cyclin T1 overexpression. Hence, an aspect of the present invention further provides a method of therapy comprising reducing expression of Larp7 in a subject in need thereof. Suitable CRISPR guide sequences for targeting Larp7 include ATCCGGAGGAAAAAACCTC (SEQ ID NO: 30), AGTCTACTGGAGATCCAAA (SEQ ID NO: 31), AAGAAAGGCCGAATGAAAA (SEQ ID NO: 32), CTTACCTGAAGTCAGAACA (SEQ ID NO: 33), ACTTTTGATCGGGGAGCTA (SEQ ID NO: 34). These may be used in a CRISPR drop-out screen, for example as described in Tzelepis et al, 2016, Cell Reports 17, 1193-1205. The Larp7 amino acid and nucleotide sequences are given as SEQ ID NO: 35 and SEQ ID NO: 36, respectively.",

                                "Expression of CDK9, CyclinT1 and RNA PolII all progressively decrease during post-natal cardiac maturation (Sano et al., 2002). We therefore first determined the extent of Myc-dependent transcriptional responsiveness in juvenile heart tissue. Unlike the adult heart, 15-day old juvenile hearts express levels of P-TEFb, RNA PolII comparable to those in adult liver (FIG. 6a and FIGS. 9a and b). Acute (4 hours) MycERT2 activation in R26CMER/+ juvenile heart induced expression of a panel of common Myc transcriptional target genes (Bzw2, Pinx1, Polr3d, St6 and Cdc25a) normally up-regulated by Myc in the liver but not in adult heart (FIG. 5b). RNA sequencing indicated a proficient global transcriptional response in juvenile heart (1601 DEGs up-regulated and 1133 down-regulated; FIG. 5c), with significant enrichment for common Myc targets (FIG. 9c), defined from the overlap of genes upregulated in response to the activation of Myc in all four tissues. Following 24 hours of tamoxifen treatment, juvenile R26CMER/+ mice heart exhibited a marked proliferative response indicated by substantial induction of both G1 (Cdk4) and G2 (Cdk1/Ccnb1) cell cycle genes (FIG. 9d), enrichment of pro-cell cycle progression gene sets (FIG. 9e) and significant levels of mitosis (FIG. 9g) specifically in troponin T-positive cardiomyocytes. The extent of Myc induced cardiomyocyte proliferation was comparable to that observed in tamoxifen-activated R26CMER/+ adult liver (FIG. 6d). To confirm that Myc was acting to induce proliferation directly in cardiomyocytes themselves, we restricted expression of MycERT2 to cardiomyocytes using the using Myh6Cre allele (Tg(Myh6-cre)2182Mds/J (Agah et al., 1997) in which Cre recombinase is driven from the Myh6 promoter that directs expression of the Myosin heavy chain a isoform solely in cardiomyocytes. Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ mice were generated and at 15 days of age given a single bolus of tamoxifen to activate MycERT2. Within 48 hrs, Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ hearts displayed p-H3 and Ki67 positivity specifically in cardiac troponin T and PCM1 positive cardiomyocytes, displayed Aurora B Kinase positivity at centrally located mid-bodies (FIG. 6e and FIG. 9f) and had doubled in size compared with R26LSL-CMER/+ controls (FIGS. 6f and g). Overt cell division was evident by a 1.8 fold increase in cardiomyocyte number without any discernible change in cardiomyocyte size (FIGS. 6g and h and FIG. 9h).",
                                "To further confirm cytokinesis, transmission electron micrographs (TEM) from Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ mice 48 hours post tamoxifen treatment were produced, 3D rendering allowed the identification of cardiomyocytes in mitosis and cytokinesis (FIG. 6i). Over the longer term, transient elevated MycERT2 activity in 15 day old Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ mice caused a large increase in heart size, increased p-H3 immunoreactivity, a large proportion of cardiomyocytes displaying disassembled sarcomeres and mice did not survive beyond 4 days post MycERT2 activation (FIG. 9i).",
                                "To directly test if increasing P-TEFb activity within cardiomyocytes of the adult heart in vivo is permissive for efficient Myc transcriptional activation and proliferation we infected wild type, R26CMER/+, Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ and R26LSL-CMER/+ mice with an adeno-associated virus directing ectopic expression of Cyclin T1 or RFP specifically in cardiomyocytes under the troponin T promoter. After 4 weeks we confirmed viral Cyclin T1 overexpression in 34% of cardiomyocytes by immunohistochemical analysis (FIG. 7a). As described previously and confirmed here, elevated expression of Ccnt1 in cardiomyocytes leads to an increase in CDK9 and phosphorylated RNA PolII (S2) (FIG. 7b). Acute MycER activation in the presence of overexpressed Cyclin T1 induced the transcription of a panel of common Myc target genes normally up-regulated by Myc in the liver but not in the adult heart (FIG. 7c and FIG. 10a). RNA sequencing indicated a proficient global transcriptional response to the activation of Myc in the presence of ectopic Cyclin T1 in the adult heart or purified cardiomyocytes, with positive enrichment for common Myc targets and pro-cell cycle progression gene sets (FIG. 10b). Positive enrichment of common Myc targets was also observed in cardiomyocytes purified from Cyclin T1 infected Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ hearts verses uninfected Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ hearts 4 hours post activation of Myc (FIG. 7d). An increase in the rate of transcription of common Myc targets in cardiomyocytes purified from Cyclin T1 infected Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ hearts in comparison to Cyclin T1 infected control R26LSL-CMER/+ hearts was inferred by a significant increase in the ratio of premature/mature mRNA (FIG. 10c). In contrast, this ratio was unchanged for genes known to be highly expressed in the heart (FIG. 10c), indicating that activation of Myc in the presence ectopic Cyclin T1 does not cause a global amplification of the pre-existing transcriptional repertoire of the adult heart.",
                                "A short pulse of MycERT2 activation in combination with Cyclin T1 overexpression resulted in a marked proliferative response in hearts collected at 48 hours post a single dose of tamoxifen, cardiomyocytes displaying markers of cell cycle, mitosis (FIGS. 7e and f, FIGS. 10d and e), cytokinesis (FIG. 6e and FIG. 10e), expression of mitosis and cytokinesis gene sets (FIG. 10f), increased heart size (FIG. 7g, h and FIG. 10g). Furthermore, 72 hours post MycERT2 activation in combination with Cyclin T1 overexpression led to a further increase in heart size accompanied by an increase in cardiomyocyte number without any change in cardiomyocyte size (FIG. 7g to i) or nucleation (FIG. 10h). A single transient burst of MycERT2 activity in Cyclin T1 expressing Myh6Cre; R26LSL-CMER/+ adult cardiomyocytes was compatible with long-term survival, with no histological abnormalities detected at 28 days after MycERT2 activation (FIG. 10i). Collectively, these data illustrate that Myc transcriptional activity can be facilitated in adult cardiomyoctes by co-activation of the transcriptional co-factor P-TEFb thus enabling adult heart tissue to re-enter the cell cycle.",
                                "Furthermore, constitutively elevated levels of P-TEFb have been noted in the hearts of TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA (Tg(tetO-HRAS)65Lc/Nci); Myh6tTA (Tg(Myh6-tTA)6Smbf/Jm) mice, which constitutively express the oncogenic HRasG12V protein in myocardium from weaning age. To test the prediction that such augmented basal levels of p-TEFb render heart tissue Myc responsive, these mice were crossed into the R26CMER/+ switchable Myc background to generate TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26CMER/+ mice. Doxycycline was withdrawn from TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26CMER/+ animals at weaning to induce expression of HRasG12V and at adulthood animals exhibited the reported elevated levels of CyclinT1, RNA PolII and phospho-RNA PolII (S2) (FIG. 11i). Activation of MycERT2 (for 24 hours) in these animals induced multiple cell cycle genes (Cdk4, Ccnd1, Cdk1, Ccnb1) (FIG. 11e) not induced by Myc in control TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26++/+ hearts and a marked proliferative response, mitosis (17.8% of cardiomyocytes phospho-histone H3 positive) and cytokinesis (FIG. 11a to d). We also observed Myc-dependent modulation of a broad panel of Myc target genes that were not affected in control adult heart (FIG. 11f). RNA sequencing confirmed increased transcription (976 DEGs up-regulated and 663 down regulated; FIG. 11g) of Myc target genes whose identities overlapped with genes induced by MycERT2 in adult liver, lung and kidney. To determine the extent that the transcriptional changes in TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26CMER/+ and TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26+/+ hearts revert to a neonatal (P1) proliferative state we compared the transcriptional profile to cardiomyocytes isolated from surgically infarcted hearts at different stages of development. Our unbiased approach revealed that the P1 neonatal regeneration signature genes were markedly enriched and correlated most closely with TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26CMER/+ hearts but not with cardiomyocytes isolated from adult infarcted hearts or with control TetO-HRas; Myh6-tTA; R26+/+ (no Myc) hearts (FIG. 11h). Collectively, these data illustrate that Myc transcription can be driven in adult cardiomyoctes by co-expression of the transcriptional co-factor P-TEFb thus enabling adult heart tissue to re-enter the cell cycle."

                        "Myc is widely acknowledged to play a pivotal coordinating role in the transcriptional control of somatic cell proliferation and tissue regeneration and its activity is deregulated and typically elevated in the majority of aggressive cancers (Amati et al., 1993; Eilers et al., 1991; Roussel et al., 1991). Past studies have largely focused on identifying Myc transcriptional programmes that are common across cell types. However, Myc exhibits great cell type variability, both with respect to how efficiently it can drive cell proliferation and the phenotypes its activities elicit in different tissues (Kortlever et al., 2017; Pelengaris et al., 2002, 1999; Shchors et al., 2006). In addition, previous studies have been limited by an inevitable focus on the longer-term outcomes of Myc activation, which makes it very difficult to parse the direct impact of Myc from the indirect pleiotropic consequences of the primary programmes that Myc engages across different tissues. To contrast and compare the direct, initial impact of Myc activation at oncogenic levels on different tissues, we developed a unique mouse model whereby the Myc encoding sequence is inserted downstream of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter, which is expressed at comparable levels across all tested tissues. This model is enhanced in several ways: first, by the option of a variant, augmented Rosa26 promoter incorporating additional CAG (CMV and \u03b2-actin promoter elements) that increases the expression level of Myc to supraphysiological levels frequent in many cancers, thereby establishing an ascending allelic series (R26MER/+, R26MER/MER, R26CMER/+, R26CMER/MER, R26CMER/CMER) of increasing Myc levels with which to ascertain the relative oncogenic roles of Myc deregulation versus over-expression. Unlike most tissue-specific promoters used to drive transgenic oncogenes, neither Rosa26 nor Rosa CAG promoters are repressed by Myc activation, obviating a major confounding issue in most conventional transgenic models. Second, replacing Myc with the well-validated, reversibly switchable 4-OHT-dependent MycERT2 variant allows the analysis of the immediate and direct impact of Myc on its target genome through rapid and synchronous MycERT2 activation by 4-OHT. Third, inclusion of tissue-specific regulation via a Cre recombinase-excisable transcriptional STOP element provides the option for tissue restricted MycERT2 expression.",
                        "In our current studies, we have used the egg-specific ZP3 promoter to engage ubiquitous expression of MycERT2 in R26CMER mice and used this to compare the direct impacts of oncogenic Myc activity in different adult mouse tissues. Using proliferation as the phenotypic signature of Myc output, we identified three general classes of response to activation of oncogenic levels of Myc: tissues that proliferated in response to MycERT2 activation; tissues that did not; and tissues that exhibited innately high endogenous Myc and proliferative indices. These innate tissue responses were maintained even when higher levels of Myc were expressed over an extended period of time. Organs with inherently high levels of cell turnover supplied from a dedicated stem cell compartment, such as the intestine and hematopoietic system, exhibit constitutively high endogenous Myc levels and activation of ectopic MycERT2 only modestly augments their already high proliferation ability. Tissues such as the liver, lung and pancreas are normally quiescent, have low endogenous levels of Myc, but capable of facultative regeneration in response to injury (Baddour et al., 2012). Activation of ectopic MycERT2 in such tissues induces a profound proliferative response. Finally, adult tissues such as the brain and heart have low endogenous levels of Myc, have little or no regenerative potential, regenerate poorly or not at all after injury and generally form scar tissue, and show no proliferative response to MycERT2 activation. The correlation between proliferative response to ectopic Myc in these tissues (FIGS. 1b and c) and the innate regenerative potential of each tissue (reviewed in Kotton and Morrisey, 2014) is striking and suggests an underlying mechanistic connection.",
                        "Myc shares both its obligate dimerization partner Max and its canonical E-box DNA binding specificity with the Mxd family of transcriptional repressor proteins and it has been suggested that Myc and Mxd compete for Max and thereby operate within a mutually antagonistic network (Ayer et al., 1993; Kretzner et al., 1992). However, we found no correlation across multiple tissues between levels of Mxd expression and proliferative response to Myc\u2014indeed, Mxd proteins are more highly expressed in some Myc-responsive tissues cells (pancreas, liver, and lung). Furthermore, our data indicating high levels of Mxd expression in proliferating tissues such as spleen and thymus shows that, as previously suggested (Baudino and Cleveland, 2001), Mxd proteins can co-exist intracellularly with Myc without necessarily antagonising Myc action. The different patterns of chromatin binding that Max-Mxd and Myc-Max dimers exhibit, possibly arising from distinct residues in the Mxd versus Myc DNA-binding basic regions, also suggest that the two classes of transcription factor operate largely independently of each other (O'Hagan et al., 2000; Solomon et al., 1993). These data confirm that, as previously suggested (Baudino and Cleveland, 2001), Mxd proteins in various organs do not significantly antagonise Myc activity.",
                        "ChIP-seq analysis 4 hours post MycERT2 activation in exemplar Myc-responsive versus non-responsive tissues (respectively, liver and heart) showed a dramatic increase in gene occupancy in both tissues. Hence, tissue non-responsiveness to Myc is not due to failure of ectopic Myc to access its chromatin targets. Indeed, we found striking similarities between the numbers of sites to which Myc is bound across the different tissues analysed, underscoring that the phenotypic outcome effected by Myc is not solely dictated at the level of recruitment to chromatin.",
                        "The significant overlap in Myc-bound promoter regions across both the liver and heart affirms the widely held notion that Myc binds a set of target genes common to multiple cell types and implicated in governing core processes required for cell growth and cell cycle progression. However, Myc also binds a set of promoter elements specific to each tissue, indicating that the Myc-dependent cistrome is cell type-specific. We also note that this tissue-specific Myc binding repertoire is characterised by the presence of chromatin marks indicative of open chromatin, in keeping with the findings of others. Interestingly as early as 4-hours post Myc activation, we clearly see a significant number of genes to be transcriptionally repressed. These repressed genes principally articulate differentiated cell-type functions and show very little overlap between tissue types. Moreover, around a third (34%) of the repressed genes appear to be indirect targets since Myc is not detected at their promoter elements (FIG. 3b). Suppression of differentiation-specific genes by oncogenic Myc has been widely observed irrespective of cell or tissue type and is an example of the robust inverse generic relationship between cell proliferation and differentiation (Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016).",
                        "A simple hypothetical explanation for the pervasive suppression of differentiation by Myc is that certain components of transcriptional machinery, such as P-TEFb or even total levels of RBP1, available for loading onto promoters are limiting, in which case repression of differentiation-specific genes is simply a consequence of their redeployment to Myc target genes, a mechanism recently proposed in 3T3 fibroblasts (De Pretis et al., 2017). Analogous scarcities in transcriptional machinery could also explain why some tissues fail to respond transcriptionally to Myc. Myc has been shown to modify both RNA PolII loading and its phosphorylation by P-TEFb (De Pretis et al., 2017; Eberhardy and Farnham, 2002; Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Kanazawa et al., 2003; Rahl et al., 2010; Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017). Prompted by the recent observation that MYC overexpression is the key molecular determinant dictating sensitivity to CDK9 inhibition in hepatocellular carcinoma (Huang et al., 2014), we showed that responsiveness of individual tissues to Myc correlates with the levels of expression of the basal transcription factors P-TEFb and RNA PolII, the pause factors, DSIF and NELF, and, inversely, with the expression of the P-TEFb repression complex.",
                        "Adult mammalian heart is a prototypical, terminally-differentiated, Myc non-responsive tissue in which Cyclin T1 is known to be a limiting transcriptional regulator whose chronic ectopic overexpression elicits promiscuous RNA polymerase activity and cardiac hypertrophy. While P1 neonatal heart retains proliferative potential, this rapidly declines after birth and is largely lost by P7. This decline in neonatal cardiac proliferative potential correlates with down-regulation of multiple genes involved in cell cycle including endogenous Myc, which is high at P1 but significantly reduced by P5 (FIG. 9a). Although changes in microRNAs, modulation of the Hippo pathway, and wholesale metabolic switching from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation have all been implicated, the mechanism underlying post-natal cardiac maturation and loss of regenerative potential remains unknown.",
                        "Interestingly, both the neonatal mouse heart and the zebrafish larval heart express high levels of P-TEFb. Whereas, the zebrafish adult heart retains 70% of the larval levels of P-TEFb and the ability to regenerate throughout development, P-TEFb levels in the adult mouse heart drop to 15%. Little is known regarding the regulation of P-TEFb during mammalian cardiac development. Levels of Cyclin T1 are regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, with mitogens and cytokine signaling known to increase Cyclin T1 protein stability. We and others have shown that the level of Cyclin T1 is the key factor regulating the level and activity of P-TEFb within cardiomyocytes. As shown in FIG. 11, oncogenic Ras signaling increases Cyclin T1 in the heart, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. It is tempting to speculate that the noted oncogenic cooperation between Ras and Myc may, in part, rely on a Ras-dependent increase in P-TEFb, promoting Myc-driven transcription.",
                        "Re-establishing regenerative proliferation in the adult heart has proven very difficult. Inhibition of Hippo signalling, enforced expression of both G1 (CDK4 and Ccnd1) and G2/M (CDK1 and Ccnb1) factors, and hypoxia all induce modest regeneration but at levels well below those seen in P1 neonatal heart. While the adult heart is refractory to Myc induced proliferation, enforced ectopic Myc expression extended the window of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation, up to around P15, a time-point that correlates with high endogenous cardiac P-TEFb expression. The large increase in cardiomyocyte number and Aurora B localization to centrally located mid-bodies suggests that cardiomyocytes isolated from juvenile mice can progress through the cell cycle and many can complete cytokinesis. Remarkably, we show that an increase in the level of P-TEFb activity in the adult heart is sufficient to support ectopic Myc dependent transcription, proliferation and cytokinesis of cardiomyocytes in vivo, resulting in increased heart size and cardiomyocyte number within a very short timeframe. Importantly this transient wave of proliferation induced in a smaller fraction of total cardiomyocytes than in juvenile mice is compatible with long-term survival. It will be of great interest to determine if this genetic combination will prove beneficial in models of cardiac injury.",
                        "Despite the significant changes in regenerative capacity and responsiveness to Myc that attend cardiac development from embryonic stem cells through mesoderm to precursor cardiomyocyte to cardiomyocyte, the chromatin status at promoters for genes involved in basic cellular function, including cell cycle regulation, show very little variation (Heintzman et al., 2009; Wamstad et al., 2012). Similarly, the Myc binding sites of the adult liver (proliferative) and the adult heart (non-proliferative) exhibit significant overlap, indicating that even after its maturation, adult, terminally-differentiated heart retains an open chromatin architecture at sites required to drive transcriptional control of proliferation. Hence, if Myc could be induced by mitogenic stimulus in the heart, cardiac epigenome architecture does not preclude heart regenerative capacity: rather, it is the inability of Myc to drive transcriptional output from regenerative target genes (due to lack of the P-TEFb/RNA Pol II complex) that thwarts cardiomyocyte proliferation.",
                        "Overall, our data indicate that tissue regenerative capacity is tightly linked to the capacity of that tissue to respond to Myc and that tissue Myc responsiveness is governed principally by availability of key components of the core transcriptional machinery, which Myc co-opts to drive its regenerative biological output. However, in addition to its core target genes, which are common across tissues, a significant number of its targets are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. By contrast, tissue-specific accessibility of target genes to Myc appears to be dictated principally by hard-wired, tissue-specific epigenome organization. Our current study focuses in the main on liver and heart as, respectively, prototypical examples of regenerative and Myc responsive versus non-regenerative and Myc-unresponsive tissues."

Likewise, the nephron cells of the kidney have a huge metabolic demand, second only to the heart. We determined the level of Myc and Ccnt1/Cdk9 proteins throughout the mouse post-natal development. Similar to the heart, the level of all 3 of these proteins drop with age to adulthood, indicating P-TEFb levels may be limiting Myc driven transcription in adulthood (FIG. 12a). MycER was activated in 10 day old mice with a single injection of tamoxifen, immunohistochemical staining showed some increased positivity of p-H3 in MycER expressing brain and kidney tissues (FIG. 12b). Therefore, enforced ectopic Myc expression can extended the window of neonatal proliferation, up to around P15, a time-point that correlates with high endogenous cardiac P-TEFb expression, in both the brain and kidney."
