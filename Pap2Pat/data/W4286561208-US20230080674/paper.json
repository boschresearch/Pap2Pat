    "title": "The interactive reading task: Transformer-based automatic item generation",
    "date": "2022-07-22",
    "abstract": "Automatic item generation (AIG) has the potential to greatly expand the number of items for educational assessments, while simultaneously allowing for a more construct-driven approach to item development. However, the traditional item modeling approach in AIG is limited in scope to content areas that are relatively easy to model (such as math problems), and depends on highly skilled content experts to create each model. In this paper we describe the interactive reading task, a transformer-based deep language modeling approach for creating reading comprehension assessments. This approach allows a fully automated process for the creation of source passages together with a wide range of comprehension questions about the passages. The format of the questions allows automatic scoring of responses with high fidelity (e.g., selected response questions). We present the results of a large-scale pilot of the interactive reading task, with hundreds of passages and thousands of questions. These passages were administered as part of the practice test of the Duolingo English Test. Human review of the materials and psychometric analyses of test taker results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for automatic creation of complex educational assessments.",

                        "The advent of internet-based computerized assessment offers many advantages compared to more traditional paper-based assessments, including support for innovative item types and alternative item formats (Sireci and Zenisky, 2006), measurement of more complex knowledge, skills, and competencies (Bartram and Hambleton, 2005), automated scoring (Shermis and Burstein, 2013) which also allows immediate feedback to students (Attali and Powers, 2010), and adaptive testing and testing on-demand (van der Linden and Glas, 2010). These advantages have resulted in increased summative as well as formative testing and consequently the challenge of much higher volume of item development (Downing and Haladyna, 2006).",
                        "This challenge may be addressed through automatic item generation (Irvine and Kyllonen, 2002; Gierl and Haladyna, 2013). Automatic item generation (AIG) is usually based on the notion of an item \u201cmodel\u201d (Bejar, 2002), a schema or template for a question with parameters that can be instantiated with specific values. For example, the model X + Y = ?, where X and Y can be any whole numbers in the range 0\u20139, has two parameters. An item model can be instantiated, using a computer-based algorithm, to display an actual item (in this case, a single-digit addition exercise). A more complex example is \u201cHow many pieces of [fruit] will you have if you cut [5] whole [fruits] into [thirds]?\u201d (Attali, 2018), where the text in parentheses represent parameters (numeric or text).",
                        "AIG has been used to create items in diverse content areas and formats (Haladyna, 2013). From a practical standpoint, the use of item models expands the potential number of items. From a theoretical standpoint, item models provide an opportunity for a construct-driven approach to item development (Embretson and Yang, 2006) because they can be tied to a mapping of the construct through an analysis of the cognitive mechanisms related to the item solution and item features that call on these mechanisms (Whitely, 1983).",
                        "However, an important limitation of the item model approach and its conventional implementation is that it is limited in scope to content areas that are relatively easy to model (such as math). In addition, because the process depends on highly skilled content experts to create the models, the AIG process is semi-automatic and can be costly in terms of the required resources.",
                        "As a result, the use of AIG as a technique to populate test or examination content is limited to relatively simple tasks. An example of a complex type of task that is not amenable to AIG is a reading comprehension task, which is the most common method used for assessment of higher-level verbal skills and abilities. Setting aside the difficulty of generating the reading passage, many reading comprehension questions would be unique for every passage, and therefore could not be produced from a simple item model. Other questions may have a standard stem (e.g., \u201cWhat is the main idea of the passage?\u201d), but the answer is of course unique to each reading passage, thereby shifting the burden to automatic scoring of possible responses (Shermis and Burstein, 2013).",
                        "A related literature in machine learning and natural language processing concerns automated question generation (AQG) for educational purposes. A recent review of this literature (Kurdi et al., 2020) classified AQG studies in terms of method of generation as template-based, rule-based, and statistical methods. Templates are a different term for models and are the most common approach used in the research reviewed. Rule-based approaches annotate sentences with syntactic and/or semantic information and then manipulate the input using suitable rules to create a question. For example, to create a WH question from a sentence, the rules would specify how to select a suitable question type (a suitable wh-word) and how to convert the sentence into a question. Template-based and rule-based methods similarly require manual development of the templates or rules (Kurdi et al., 2020). In contrast, with statistical methods the rules for question generation are implicitly learned through sophisticated language models."

                        "Language modeling seeks to develop a probabilistic model of language that can be subsequently used both to determine how likely a given text is and to stochastically generate plausible continuations to a given text. Language modeling has been at the core of natural language processing (NLP) research for decades (Shannon, 1951; Ney et al., 1994), but the most recent advances based on neural transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019) have made significant progress on the goal of being able to generate long, coherent, and information-rich sequences of text. What distinguishes transformer architectures from earlier neural network architectures is their ability to allow long-distance lexical relationships in text to have a much more direct influence on the task of predicting the next token in a sequence, allowing the model to more effectively leverage significantly longer contexts when making its predictions.",
                        "While these models often require a tremendous amount of training data and computing power to train initially, the trained models can be used to generate representations of language that can be subsequently used as inputs to train models for other language-related tasks such as text classification and question answering (Sun et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). These task-specific models typically need significantly less labeled training data in order to achieve the same or better results as systems trained on one or two orders of magnitude more data. However, they still require updating the model with a non-trivial amount of expert annotated data.",
                        "One of the most impressive recent examples has been OpenAI's GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020). This model has demonstrated the ability to learn the format and style of a text based on fewer than 10 examples in order to generate novel, coherent content without the need to explicitly update the underlying model. Because it mirrors the format as well as the style of any natural text, the generated output of the model can be natural text, enumerated lists, a paragraph paired with attributes or comprehension questions, or even well-formatted HTML code. As such, models such as GPT-3 represent a tremendous opportunity for innovations in AIG by allowing test designers to prototype and iterate on new item types without the need for significant expert-annotated data or lengthy model development and training processes."

There is a sharp tradeoff associated with these two general formats. Open-ended questions are much easier to automatically generate (trivial for some of the questions) but very difficult to score automatically. For example, the c-rater (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003) short-answer automated-scoring engine requires hundreds of human-annotated training examples for each question, and as a result has been used mostly in research studies (Attali et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2016), as opposed to operational high-stakes assessments. The alternative selected-response format is trivial to score but can be very difficult to automatically generate the associated options, both distractors and correct answers. In general the IR questions were designed as selected-response questions and option generation is at the heart of the AIG approach outlined below.",

Although this format is open-ended, responses are compared to a single correct answer (a particular part of the text). For grading purposes, a text selection is defined as a point in the two-dimensional space for the location of the start and end indexes of the selection. A continuous grade between 0 and 1 is then calculated based on the discrepancy (geometric distance) between the point representations of the response and the correct answer. This grading approach is more nuanced than one which only considers the degree of overlap between a response and the correct answer. For example, two responses might both have no overlap with the correct answer, but one can be closer than the other to the correct answer (and therefore will be assigned a higher grade)."

Similarity is computed by encoding the passage and each candidate answer using the SentenceTransformers1 library into a vector representation and computing the cosine similarity between them. We can also compute similarity between a candidate correct answer and each sentence in the passage to measure how well an answer aligns with a particular section of the passage. The average negative log likelihood is derived from the output distribution of the large language model. The probability of each token in a candidate answer, conditioned on all prior tokens, is estimated by the language model.

Candidates must have between 8 and 30 words and cannot be one of the first two sentences or the last sentence in the passage. The best candidates will have high likelihood, given the first part of the passage.

Accordingly, for each of the alternative passages, we generate a set of possible answers to each item using the same instructions and examples for generating possible correct answers, but conditioning on the alternative passage instead of the original one. An example of automatically produced alternative texts, as well as the main ideas and titles associated with them, is presented in the Appendix.

Candidate words for deletion are then filtered based on the likelihood and rank order of the original word being suggested by the model (e.g., a word is more likely to be selected if it has the highest likelihood), syntactic information about the word (e.g., nouns are more likely to be selected than adjectives), semantic information about the word (e.g., the frequency of the word is taken into account in the context of passage difficulty), and the distance (i.e., the number of words that separate consecutive deleted words) between the original word and the nearby successful candidates (e.g., the further a word is from other candidates, the more likely the word is to be selected for deletion). We use Spacy (Honnibal et al., 2020) for part of speech tagging and lemmatization and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (Davies, 2009) for word frequencies. Candidate distractors for deleted words are then selected from the model's likelihood output for all other words in its vocabulary.

Its availability and 1-h duration creates an improved experience for test takers over other standardized tests, which take 3\u20134 h to complete and can only be taken at a testing center, sometimes hundreds of miles away from the test taker's home. Test scores are reported within 48 h of test completion, and test takers can share their scores with as many accepting institutions as they need, free of charge (Cardwell et al., 2022)."

When generating new passages, we conditioned the output by just the topic, with expository and narrative texts generated based on 270 possible topics corresponding to common fields of university study, while news texts were based on 45 common news article categories.",
                        "This set of passages went through two rounds of automated filters. The first set filtered the passage based on general desirable qualities of the text. We filtered passages to be 100\u2013175 words with 5\u201320 sentences. We removed passages that contain repeated 8-grams to avoid passages containing a high degree of repetition by the language model, as well as passages that contain profanity or other potentially offensive content using a standard offensive word list. We also filtered passages in two ways based on the negative log likelihood of each sentence as estimated by the language model, averaged over the tokens: We imposed an upper bound on the maximum negative log likelihood that any sentence can have as a simple estimate of the expected coherence of the passage. If a sentence has extremely high negative log likelihood, it is more likely to make less sense in the context of the passage. Additionally, for the completion task we imposed an even stricter negative log likelihood threshold to identify viable candidate sentences, as we wanted to ensure that the correct answer is very likely to fit in the context of the passage. These thresholds were identified through manual review of passages and potential candidate sentences.",

Passages for which items and distractors could not be generated according to our specifications were removed from our set. We retained a set of 789 passages following the item generation and filtering process. For each of these passages we generated a vocabulary-in-context task (with 6.6 fill-in-the-blank words on average, and with four distractors), one text completion task, two comprehension tasks, one main-idea task, and one possible title task. All selected-response tasks (except for the vocabulary-in-context task) were generated with three distractors."

Item discrimination evaluates how well an item is able to distinguish between test takers who are knowledgeable and those who are not. Item discrimination is measured here with item-total correlations, where total was defined as the total practice test score. A higher item-total correlation signifies that test takers with higher total scores were more likely to also answer the item correctly.",

Nevertheless, most items show reasonably high discrimination (with an overall average of 0.27), with small differences across tasks. In total, only 6% of items had an item-total correlation lower than 0.1. However, even this number can be significantly reduced through a distractor analysis. By computing discrimination indices for each distractor (see Attali and Fraenkel, 2000) we can identify distractors for which the average total score of test takers endorsing them is higher than the average total score of test takers endorsing the correct answer. About 3% of all distractors are failing in this way. Removing these distractors (essentially administering the item with one less distractor) reduces the number of items with item-total correlation lower than 0.1 to only 2%."

Pairs of items that violate this assumption are said to exhibit local item dependency (LID). It is well-known (Yen, 1993) that sets of items that are based on a common stimulus, such as reading comprehension questions, can result in local dependence that is due to the fact that information used to answer different items is interrelated in the stimulus. In the present context, the threat of LID is even greater since the items were automatically generated. In particular, we expected that LID is more likely to be present between two deleted words of the same cloze task, as well as between two later tasks (e.g., the main-idea and the title task).",

As an approximation of this approach, we computed the partial correlations between pairs of items, controlling for total practice test score. In the analyses below, a common threshold of 0.3 (Christensen et al., 2017) was employed for categorizing residual correlations as indicating LID.",

The two groups are also similar in their advanced academic and professional jr reading strategies (Grabe and Stoller, 2013).

Feedback helps learners determine performance expectations, judge their level of understanding, and become aware of misconceptions. It may also provide clues about the best approaches for correcting mistakes and improving performance. However, feedback has had almost no place in large-scale assessment (Attali and Powers, 2010; Attali, 2015).",

At the same time, a subtle form of corrective feedback is provided, whereby along with the rest of the passage, the answers to the previous items are also revealed. We are exploring ways to enhance feedback. For example, test takers could receive immediate feedback about the correctness of their responses and be asked to try again in the case of errors. This type of multiple-try feedback has been shown to decrease test anxiety and improve measurement accuracy by allowing partial credit grading (Attali and Powers, 2010; Attali, 2011)."

Additionally, recent work has demonstrated the ability to estimate the psychometric properties of passage-based items using a featurized approach based on the BERT transformer model (Devlin et al., 2019), allowing for the estimation of parameters of newly created items that do not yet have any response data (McCarthy et al., 2021). This work primarily focuses on estimating the psychometric properties of items that test vocabulary in context, so we plan to explore methods to adapt it to multiple choice and reading comprehension questions about the passages. These estimates can then be used to refine our item generation processes in order to select passages, distractors and comprehension questions that will result in the items having the desired psychometric properties."

This presents unique challenges in terms of psychometric modeling, since continuous response models are not often discussed in the context of IRT. For modeling responses on the unit interval, the Beta distribution has been proposed in the psychometrics literature (Noel and Dauvier, 2007; Chen et al., 2019). However, existing approaches are limited in different ways. The approach by Chen et al. (2019) assumes that latent ability is constrained to the unit interval, a constraint that is inconsistent with normal IRT assumptions. The approach by Noel and Dauvier (2007) does not include discrimination parameters, a constraint that is also inconsistent with other common IRT models, such as the 2PL model. The IR task would require innovative psychometric models that can combine discrete and continuous grades, as well as support modeling of item discrimination."

Another possible avenue is different response formats. The digital format of IR makes it possible to accommodate multiple types of response formats, such as dragging and dropping, free response (both spoken and written), and interacting with other media such as a chart, a table, or a graph. The advantage of the digital format can be extended to the modality of the delivery as well, where, for instance, comprehension questions could be delivered aurally. All of these would allow for a fuller approximation of what is read, how it is read, and what comes after reading in academic contexts."
