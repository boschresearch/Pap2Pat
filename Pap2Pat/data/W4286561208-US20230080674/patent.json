                        "The advent of internet-based computerized skills assessment offers many advantages compared to more traditional paper-based assessments. These include support for innovative item types and alternative item formats, measurement of more complex knowledge, skills, and competencies, automated scoring which also allows immediate feedback to students, and adaptive testing and testing on-demand. These advantages have resulted in increased summative as well as formative testing and, consequently, the challenge of needing higher levels of test item development to support these new features of testing.",
                        "One method that may be used to address this challenge is through automatic item generation. Automatic item generation (AIG) is typically based on the notion of item \u201cmodels\u201d (Bejar 2002), that is schemas of problems with parameters that can be instantiated with specific values. For example, the model X+Y=?, where X and Y can be any whole numbers in the range 0-9, has two parameters. An item model can be instantiated, using a computer-based algorithm, to display an actual test or evaluation item (in this case, a single-digit addition exercise).",
                        "Automatic Item Generation (AIG) has been used to create items in diverse content areas and formats. From a practical standpoint, the use of item models expands the potential number of items that may be generated. From a theoretical standpoint, item models provide an opportunity for a construct-driven approach to item development because the generated items can be mapped to the construct through an analysis of the cognitive mechanisms related to the item solution and item features that call on these mechanisms.",
                        "However, an important limitation of the item model approach and its conventional implementation is that it is limited in scope to content areas that are sufficiently easy to model (such as mathematics). In addition, because the item generation process depends on highly skilled content experts to create the models, the AIG process is semi-automated and can be costly to implement in terms of the required resources.",
                        "As a result, use of AIG as a technique to populate test or examination content is limited to simple tasks. An example of a complex type of task that is not amenable to AIG is a reading comprehension task, which is the most common method used for assessment of higher-level verbal skills and abilities. For example, Sphinx, which is typically considered the most advanced system for the automated generation of reading comprehension assessments, is a hybrid system that automatically generates reading texts. However, the system relies on human experts to generate reading comprehension questions, and item models to generate simple grammatical questions, such as sentence fragment correction questions.",
                        "Embodiments of the disclosure overcome these and other disadvantages of conventional approaches to generating content for evaluating the performance of a test-taker, both collectively and individually."

If there is a significant mismatch (or occurrence of mismatches) between the attribute value used to generate the text and a model's predicted label for the text (where the predicted label is expected to indicate the attribute type or class), then this may indicate that the attribute itself is uninformative to the Transformer-based Language Model or is not clearly enough expressed in the Examples. One could use that information to cease using the attribute or to identify Examples which better exemplify the attribute.

                                "By using the same instructions, examples, and passage attributes that were used to generate the Source Passage, the disclosed process can ensure that the newly generated Alternative Passage(s) will share many of the same characteristics of the Source or original passage. For example, if the Source Passage has three attributes for \u201cTopic\u201d, \u201cTitle\u201d, and \u201cPerson\u201d, an Alternative Passage can be generated using the same values for those attributes to produce a topically and stylistically similar passage.",
                                "Alternative passages can also be generated using a subset of the attribute-value pairs of a Source Passage. A result of this may be an Alternative Passage which is slightly more differentiated from the Source Passage than one which was generated using all of the attributes. A subset of the Source Passage's attribute values could also be modified to produce further differences between the Source Passage and the generated Alternative Passages. The types of modifications to the set of attributes may depend on the type of attributes used to condition the passage. In one non-limiting example, a Source Passage could be generated with the \u201cTopic\u201d attribute of \u201cPhysics\u201d and sub-topic of \u201cGravity\u201d, while its Alternative Passages could be generated using the more general topic \u201cScience\u201d and sub-topic of \u201cGravity\u201d.",
                                "In addition, when generating answers to a multiple-choice question, the alternative passage(s) can be used to generate answers that will likewise be topically and stylistically similar to ones generated using the Source Passage. However, they will differ in terms of exact content, making them appropriate for use as distractors, or incorrect but feasible answers to a question.",
                                "The generated Alternative Passages are typically subject to a similar filtering process as the Source or original set of passages, as described in the prior discussion of the passage selection and eligibility criteria. In addition, one can compute the textual similarity between a generated Alternative Passage and the corresponding Source Passage. This may be helpful in filtering out those Alternative Passages that are \u201ctoo similar\u201d to the Source Passage (i.e., those that might inadvertently produce a correct answer to the Source passage), as well as those that are too different (i.e., those that would produce answers that are significantly and obviously different from the correct one for a Source Passage).",
                                "There are multiple methods of computing textual similarity, such as by generating word embeddings (vectors) and comparing two vectors using a defined metric (Euclidean distance or cosine distance, as non-limiting examples). The threshold value used to determine a situation of too great or too little similarity can be tuned based on internally evaluated metrics derived from generated answers and items, as well as by the performance of test takers on generated items and answers. Other approaches to determining textual similarity include evaluating semantic similarity, contextual evaluation, or another suitable approach.",
                                "As a further and non-limiting example, textual similarity may be determined by measuring n-gram overlap or measuring the percentage (%) overlap of unique words/word lemmas between two samples. For generating the \u201cword\u201d vectors, suitable approaches include counting occurrences of each word and weighting them (using Term Frequency or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, known as TF-IDF weight, as an example). One could also or instead use word embeddings produced by a machine learning model, aggregating over the words in a selection of text (by averaging them, or by averaging and normalizing based on statistics from a large collection of texts, as examples).",
                                "One could (or instead) also input the text to a neural network model. Two common types of models are transfer-focused sentence encoders and autoencoders. Transfer-focused sentence encoders try to represent a long piece of text in a vector that can be used as an input to other tasks, such as identifying properties of a sentence, as an example. Autoencoders are trained to transform a piece of text into an embedding from which the original sentence can be reproduced.",
                                "In one embodiment, the process may generate test items and/or (correct) responses based on a passage using item generation templates. In this embodiment, an item generation template may include (1) the instructions, (2) examples, with each consisting of a passage and one or more correct responses to the task, and (3) the conditioning, consisting of the text of the passage.",
                                "For a given passage (the Source Passage), a correct answer to a multiple-choice test item can be generated using an Item Template in conjunction with the Source Passage as the Conditioning, as shown in the prior example (Generate a possible next sentence to continue the story). As also described, a single Item Template can potentially generate multiple correct answers, and a Transformer-based Language Model can be used to generate answers non-deterministically. Therefore, multiple applications of the model may provide a range of different answers; however, the process may also generate answers that are not correct.",
                                "To address this concern regarding possible incorrect answers, the Source Passage may be used multiple times to generate a pool of potential correct answers (a set of Correct Candidates). These candidates may then be evaluated using one or more criteria to identify the best possible candidate(s), as described herein.",
                                "As mentioned, the Alternative Passages can be used to generate distractors. Each Alternative Passage may be used to generate possible incorrect answers by treating the Alternative Passage as if it were the Source Passage, i.e., pairing it with the Item Template and using a Transformer-based Language Model to generate correct answers for that passage. These answers, when paired with the actual Source Passage, are expected to be incorrect due to the variations in the content of the Alternative Passages compared to the Source Passage. These answers may therefore be used as a set of Distractor Candidates.",
                                "As with the Correct Candidates, the transformer model's stochastic generation process could generate answers that are unintentionally correct (or close to being correct) when paired with the Source Passage.

In general, one or both of correct answers and distractor candidates may be filtered for overly rare words, grammatical errors and/or offensive content, similarly to the filtering that may be applied to passages.",

To that end, the disclosed process may be used to generate factual recall and synthesis-based questions in other domains. For example, a modification of the described process flow or pipeline could have the Source Passages come from an actual textbook that a student has read.

In another embodiment, incorrect answers could be generated using one of the two passages. For example, an item could ask a test taker to identify which sentence best supports the argumentative point of passage A.
