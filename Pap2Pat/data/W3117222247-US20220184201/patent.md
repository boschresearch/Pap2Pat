## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Zika virus (ZIKV), first identified in 1947 (Dick et al., 1952, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 46: 509-520), is a flavivirus that has recently been associated with microcephaly and other birth defects in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults (Pierson and Graham, 2016, Cell, 625-631). Effective vaccines have been approved for other closely related flaviviruses, including yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses (Beck and Barrett, 2015, Expert Rev Vaccines, 14: 1479-1492; Jarmer et al., 2014, J Virol, 88: 13845-13857; Guy and Jackson, 2016, Nat Rev, Microbiol, 14: 45-54), but vaccine candidates for ZIKV have only recently been developed (Larocca et al., 2016, Nature, 536: 474-478; Abbink et al., 2016, Science, 353, 1129-1132; Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354, 237-240). Larocca and colleagues generated a purified inactivated virus vaccine and a plasmid DNA vaccine that induced complete protection in mice from ZIKV infection (Larocca et al., 2016, Nature, 536: 474-478). The same laboratory also demonstrated that these vaccine platforms and a rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 vector (RhAd52) elicited complete protection against ZIKV in non-human primates (NHPs) (Abbink et al., 2016, Science, 353, 1129-1132). Most recently, Dowd and colleagues described two plasmid DNA vaccines that induced potent immune responses after two immunizations, which protected mice and NHPs from ZIKV infection (Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354, 237-240). The ideal vaccine is safe and induces protective immunity after a single immunization, regardless of prior serologic history. Of the candidate Zika vaccines described to date, only the RhAd52 platform has been shown to confer protection after a single immunization in NHPs; however, the efficacy of this rhesus adenovirus vector in humans is currently undefined. Additionally, pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotypes can limit the efficacy of such vectors (Ledgerwood et al., 2010, Vaccine, 29: 304-313; Sumida et al., 2004, J Virol, 78: 2666-2673), and low neutralizing titers to rhesus adenoviruses, including RhAd52, have been detected in humans (Abbink et al., 2015, J Virol, 89: 1512-1522).

Thus, there is a need in the art for improved compositions and methods to treat and prevent ZIKV infection. The present invention satisfies this unmet need.

### Definitions

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

As used herein, each of the following terms has the meaning associated with it in this section.

The articles “a” and “an” are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, “an element” means one element or more than one element.

“About” as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of 20%, ±10%, ±5%, +1%, or +0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.

The term “antibody,” as used herein, refers to an immunoglobulin molecule, which specifically binds with an antigen. Antibodies can be intact immunoglobulins derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources and can be immunoreactive portions of intact immunoglobulins. Antibodies are typically tetramers of immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies in the present invention may exist in a variety of forms including, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, Fv, Fab and F(ab)2, as well as single chain antibodies and humanized antibodies (Harlow et al., 1999, In: Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY; Harlow et al., 1989, In: Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Houston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426).

The term “antibody fragment” refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, scFv antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

An “antibody heavy chain,” as used herein, refers to the larger of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations.

An “antibody light chain,” as used herein, refers to the smaller of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations. κ and λ light chains refer to the two major antibody light chain isotypes.

By the term “synthetic antibody” as used herein, is meant an antibody, which is generated using recombinant DNA technology, such as, for example, an antibody expressed by a bacteriophage. The term should also be construed to mean an antibody which has been generated by the synthesis of a DNA molecule encoding the antibody and which DNA molecule expresses an antibody protein, or an amino acid sequence specifying the antibody, wherein the DNA or amino acid sequence has been obtained using synthetic DNA or amino acid sequence technology which is available and well known in the art. The term should also be construed to mean an antibody, which has been generated by the synthesis of an RNA molecule encoding the antibody. The RNA molecule expresses an antibody protein, or an amino acid sequence specifying the antibody, wherein the RNA has been obtained by transcribing DNA (synthetic or cloned) or other technology, which is available and well known in the art.

The term “antigen” or “Ag” as used herein is defined as a molecule that provokes an adaptive immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunogenically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen. Furthermore, antigens can be derived from recombinant or genomic DNA or RNA. A skilled artisan will understand that any DNA or RNA, which comprises a nucleotide sequence or a partial nucleotide sequence encoding a protein that elicits an adaptive immune response therefore encodes an “antigen” as that term is used herein. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will understand that an antigen need not be encoded solely by a full-length nucleotide sequence of a gene. It is readily apparent that the present invention includes, but is not limited to, the use of partial nucleotide sequences of more than one gene and that these nucleotide sequences are arranged in various combinations to elicit the desired immune response. Moreover, a skilled artisan will understand that an antigen need not be encoded by a “gene” at all. It is readily apparent that an antigen can be generated synthesized or can be derived from a biological sample. Such a biological sample can include, but is not limited to a tissue sample, a tumor sample, a cell or a biological fluid.

The term “adjuvant” as used herein is defined as any molecule to enhance an antigen-specific adaptive immune response.

A “disease” is a state of health of an animal wherein the animal cannot maintain homeostasis, and wherein if the disease is not ameliorated then the animal's health continues to deteriorate. In contrast, a “disorder” in an animal is a state of health in which the animal is able to maintain homeostasis, but in which the animal's state of health is less favorable than it would be in the absence of the disorder. Left untreated, a disorder does not necessarily cause a further decrease in the animal's state of health.

An “effective amount” as used herein, means an amount which provides a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit.

“Encoding” refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in a polynucleotide, such as a gene, a cDNA, or an mRNA, to serve as templates for synthesis of other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence of nucleotides (i.e., rRNA, tRNA and mRNA) or a defined sequence of amino acids and the biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus, a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.

“Expression vector” refers to a vector comprising a recombinant polynucleotide comprising expression control sequences operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence to be expressed. An expression vector comprises sufficient cis-acting elements for expression; other elements for expression can be supplied by the host cell or in an in vitro expression system. Expression vectors include all those known in the art, such as cosmids, plasmids (e.g., naked or contained in liposomes) RNA, and viruses (e.g., lentiviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses) that incorporate the recombinant polynucleotide.

“Homologous” refers to the sequence similarity or sequence identity between two polypeptides or between two nucleic acid molecules. When a position in both of the two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit, e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then the molecules are homologous at that position. The percent of homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared×100. For example, if 6 of 10 of the positions in two sequences are matched or homologous then the two sequences are 60% homologous. By way of example, the DNA sequences ATTGCC and TATGGC share 50% homology. Generally, a comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum homology.

“Immunogen” refers to any substance introduced into the body in order to generate an immune response. That substance can a physical molecule, such as a protein, or can be encoded by a vector, such as DNA, mRNA, or a virus.

“Immune response,” as the term is used herein, means a process involving the activation and/or induction of an effector function in, by way of non-limiting examples, a T cell, B cell, natural killer (NK) cell, and/or antigen-presenting cells (APC). Thus, an immune response, as would be understood by the skilled artisan, includes, but is not limited to, any detectable antigen-specific activation and/or induction of a helper T cell or cytotoxic T cell activity or response, production of antibodies, antigen presenting cell activity or infiltration, macrophage activity or infiltration, neutrophil activity or infiltration, and the like.

“Isolated” means altered or removed from the natural state. For example, a nucleic acid or a peptide naturally present in a living animal is not “isolated,” but the same nucleic acid or peptide partially or completely separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is “isolated.” An isolated nucleic acid or protein can exist in substantially purified form, or can exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, a host cell.

In the context of the present invention, the following abbreviations for the commonly occurring nucleosides (nucleobase bound to ribose or deoxyribose sugar via N-glycosidic linkage) are used. “A” refers to adenosine, “C” refers to cytidine, “G” refers to guanosine, “T” refers to thymidine, and “U” refers to uridine.

Unless otherwise specified, a “nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence” includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence. The phrase nucleotide sequence that encodes a protein or an RNA may also include introns to the extent that the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein may in some version contain an intron(s).

By the term “modulating,” as used herein, is meant mediating a detectable increase or decrease in the level of a response in a subject compared with the level of a response in the subject in the absence of a treatment or compound, and/or compared with the level of a response in an otherwise identical but untreated subject. The term encompasses perturbing and/or affecting a native signal or response thereby mediating a beneficial therapeutic response in a subject, such as, a human.

Unless otherwise specified, a “nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence” includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and RNA may include introns. In addition, the nucleotide sequence may contain modified nucleosides that are capable of being translation by translational machinery in a cell. For example, an mRNA where all of the uridines have been replaced with pseudouridine, 1-methyl psuedouridine, or another modified nucleoside. The term “operably linked” refers to functional linkage between a regulatory sequence and a heterologous nucleic acid sequence resulting in expression of the latter. For example, a first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA or RNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, in the same reading frame. The terms “patient,” “subject,” “individual,” and the like are used interchangeably herein, and refer to any animal, or cells thereof whether in vitro or in situ, amenable to the methods described herein. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the patient, subject or individual is a human.

The term “polynucleotide” as used herein is defined as a chain of nucleotides. Furthermore, nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Thus, nucleic acids and polynucleotides as used herein are interchangeable. One skilled in the art has the general knowledge that nucleic acids are polynucleotides, which can be hydrolyzed into the monomeric “nucleotides.” The monomeric nucleotides can be hydrolyzed into nucleosides. As used herein polynucleotides include, but are not limited to, all nucleic acid sequences which are obtained by any means available in the art, including, without limitation, recombinant means, i.e., the cloning of nucleic acid sequences from a recombinant library or a cell genome, using ordinary cloning technology and PCR™, and the like, and by synthetic means.

In certain instances, the polynucleotide or nucleic acid of the invention is a “nucleoside-modified nucleic acid,” which refers to a nucleic acid comprising at least one modified nucleoside. A “modified nucleoside” refers to a nucleoside with a modification. For example, over one hundred different nucleoside modifications have been identified in RNA (Rozenski, et al., 1999, The RNA Modification Database: 1999 update. Nucl Acids Res 27: 196-197).

In certain embodiments, “pseudouridine” refers, in another embodiment, to m1acp3Ψ (1-methyl-3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine. In another embodiment, the term refers to m1Ψ (1-methylpseudouridine). In another embodiment, the term refers to Ψm (2′-O-methylpseudouridine. In another embodiment, the term refers to m5D (5-methyldihydrouridine). In another embodiment, the term refers to m3Ψ (3-methylpseudouridine). In another embodiment, the term refers to a pseudouridine moiety that is not further modified. In another embodiment, the term refers to a monophosphate, diphosphate, or triphosphate of any of the above pseudouridines. In another embodiment, the term refers to any other pseudouridine known in the art. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.

As used herein, the terms “peptide,” “polypeptide,” and “protein” are used interchangeably, and refer to a compound comprised of amino acid residues covalently linked by peptide bonds. A protein or peptide must contain at least two amino acids, and no limitation is placed on the maximum number of amino acids that can comprise a protein's or peptide's sequence. Polypeptides include any peptide or protein comprising two or more amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds. As used herein, the term refers to both short chains, which also commonly are referred to in the art as peptides, oligopeptides and oligomers, for example, and to longer chains, which generally are referred to in the art as proteins, of which there are many types. “Polypeptides” include, for example, biologically active fragments, substantially homologous polypeptides, oligopeptides, homodimers, heterodimers, variants of polypeptides, modified polypeptides, derivatives, analogs, fusion proteins, among others. The polypeptides include natural peptides, recombinant peptides, synthetic peptides, or a combination thereof.

The term “promoter” as used herein is defined as a DNA sequence recognized by the synthetic machinery of the cell, or introduced synthetic machinery, required to initiate the specific transcription of a polynucleotide sequence. For example, the promoter that is recognized by bacteriophage RNA polymerase and is used to generate the mRNA by in vitro transcription.

By the term “specifically binds,” as used herein with respect to an antibody, is meant an antibody which recognizes a specific antigen, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in a sample. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen from one species may also bind to that antigen from one or more other species. But, such cross-species reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In another example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen may also bind to different allelic forms of the antigen. However, such cross reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In some instances, the terms “specific binding” or “specifically binding,” can be used in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, to mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope “A”, the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled “A” and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.

The term “therapeutic” as used herein means a treatment and/or prophylaxis. A therapeutic effect is obtained by suppression, diminution, remission, or eradication of at least one sign or symptom of a disease or disorder.

The term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, or subject that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes that amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the signs or symptoms of the disorder or disease being treated. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the subject to be treated.

To “treat” a disease as the term is used herein, means to reduce the frequency or severity of at least one sign or symptom of a disease or disorder experienced by a subject.

The term “transfected” or “transformed” or “transduced” as used herein refers to a process by which exogenous nucleic acid is transferred or introduced into the host cell. A “transfected” or “transformed” or “transduced” cell is one which has been transfected, transformed or transduced with exogenous nucleic acid. The cell includes the primary subject cell and its progeny.

The phrase “under transcriptional control” or “operatively linked” as used herein means that the promoter is in the correct location and orientation in relation to a polynucleotide to control the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase and expression of the polynucleotide.

A “vector” is a composition of matter which comprises an isolated nucleic acid and which can be used to deliver the isolated nucleic acid to the interior of a cell. Numerous vectors are known in the art including, but not limited to, linear polynucleotides, polynucleotides associated with ionic or amphiphilic compounds, plasmids, and viruses. Thus, the term “vector” includes an autonomously replicating plasmid or a virus. The term should also be construed to include non-plasmid and non-viral compounds which facilitate transfer of nucleic acid into cells, such as, for example, polylysine compounds, liposomes, and the like. Examples of viral vectors include, but are not limited to, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, and the like.

Ranges: throughout this disclosure, various aspects of the invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 2.7, 3, 4, 5, 5.3, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range.

For example, in certain embodiments, the composition comprises a vaccine comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding a ZIKV antigen. In certain embodiments, the ZIKV antigen induces expression of a protective antibody. In certain embodiments, the ZIKV antigen provides an adjuvant function.

In one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA. For example, in certain embodiments, the composition of the invention comprises IVT RNA which encodes a ZIKV antigen, where the ZIKV antigen induces an adaptive immune response. In certain embodiments, the ZIKV antigen is at least one of ZIKV envelope (E) protein, ZIKV pre-membrane (prM) protein, ZIKV membrane (M) protein, ZIKV capsid (C) protein, ZIKV NS1, ZIKV NS2A, ZIKV NS2B, ZIKV NS3, ZIKV NS4A, ZIKV NS4B, ZIKV NS5, or a fragment thereof.

In certain embodiments, the antigen-encoding nucleic acid of the present composition is a nucleoside-modified RNA. The present invention is based in part on the finding that nucleoside-modified RNA encoding a ZIKV antigen induces a robust and durable immune response against ZIKV. Further, the ZIKV antigen-encoding nucleoside-modified RNA was observed to induce antigen-specific antibody production. The nucleoside-modified RNA is demonstrated to induce adaptive immune responses that are comparable or superior to current ZIKV vaccine strategies.

In certain embodiments, the antigen-encoding nucleic acid of the present composition is a purified nucleoside-modified RNA. For example, in certain embodiments, the composition is purified such that is free of double-stranded contaminants.

In certain embodiments, the composition comprises a lipid nanoparticle (LNP). For example, in one embodiment, the composition comprises a ZIKV antigen-encoding nucleic acid molecule encapsulated within a LNP. In certain instances, the LNP enhances cellular uptake of the nucleic acid molecule.

In certain embodiments, the composition comprises an adjuvant. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises a nucleic acid molecule encoding an adjuvant. For example, in one embodiment, the composition comprises a nucleoside-modified RNA encoding an adjuvant. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a nucleoside-modified RNA encoding a ZIKV antigen and an adjuvant.

In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering a plurality of doses to the subject. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering a single dose of the composition, where the single dose is effective in inducing an adaptive immune response. In one embodiment, the method provides a sustained or prolonged immune response.

### Vaccine

In one embodiment, the present invention provides an immunogenic composition for inducing an immune response against ZIKV in a subject. For example, in one embodiment, the immunogenic composition is a vaccine. For a composition to be useful as a vaccine, the composition must induce an immune response to the ZIKV antigen in a cell, tissue or mammal (e.g., a human). In certain instances, the vaccine induces a protective immune response in the mammal. As used herein, an “immunogenic composition” may comprise an antigen (e.g., a peptide or polypeptide), a nucleic acid encoding an antigen, a cell expressing or presenting an antigen or cellular component, or a combination thereof. In particular embodiments, the composition comprises or encodes all or part of any peptide antigen described herein, or an immunogenically functional equivalent thereof. In other embodiments, the composition is in a mixture that comprises an additional immunostimulatory agent or nucleic acids encoding such an agent. Immunostimulatory agents include but are not limited to an additional antigen, an immunomodulator, an antigen presenting cell, lipid nanoparticle, or an adjuvant. In other embodiments, one or more of the additional agent(s) is covalently bonded to the antigen or an immunostimulatory agent, in any combination.

In the context of the present invention, the term “vaccine” refers to a composition that induces an immune response upon inoculation into animals. In some embodiments, the induced immune response provides protective immunity.

A vaccine of the present invention may vary in its composition of nucleic acid and/or cellular components. In a non-limiting example, a nucleic acid encoding a ZIKV antigen might also be formulated with an adjuvant. Of course, it will be understood that various compositions described herein may further comprise additional components. For example, one or more vaccine components may be comprised in a lipid, liposome, or lipid nanoparticle. In another non-limiting example, a vaccine may comprise one or more adjuvants. A vaccine of the present invention, and its various components, may be prepared and/or administered by any method disclosed herein or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of the present disclosure.

The induction of the immunity by the expression of the ZIKV antigen can be detected by observing in vivo or in vitro the response of all or any part of the immune system in the host against the ZIKV antigen.

For example, a method for detecting the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is well known. A foreign substance that enters the living body is presented to T cells and B cells by the action of APCs. T cells that respond to the antigen presented by APC in an antigen specific manner differentiate into cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs) due to stimulation by the antigen. These antigen-stimulated cells then proliferate. This process is referred to herein as “activation” of T cells. Therefore, CTL induction by an epitope of a polypeptide or peptide or combinations thereof can be evaluated by presenting an epitope of a polypeptide or peptide or combinations thereof to a T cell by APC, and detecting the induction of CTL. Furthermore, APCs have the effect of activating B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, eosinophils and NK cells.

A method for evaluating the inducing action of CTL using dendritic cells (DCs) as APC is well known in the art. DC is a representative APC having a robust CTL inducing action among APCs. In the methods of the invention, the epitope of a polypeptide or peptide or combinations thereof is initially expressed by the DC and then this DC is contacted with T cells. Detection of T cells having cytotoxic effects against the cells of interest after the contact with DC shows that the epitope of a polypeptide or peptide or combinations thereof has an activity of inducing the cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, the induced immune response can be also examined by measuring IFN-gamma produced and released by CTL in the presence of antigen-presenting cells that carry immobilized peptide or combination of peptides by visualizing using anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, such as an ELISPOT assay.

Apart from DC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may also be used as the APC. The induction of CTL is reported to be enhanced by culturing PBMC in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. Similarly, CTL has been shown to be induced by culturing PBMC in the presence of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and IL-7.

The antigens confirmed to possess CTL-inducing activity by these methods are antigens having DC activation effect and subsequent CTL-inducing activity. Furthermore, CTLs that have acquired cytotoxicity due to presentation of the antigen by APC can be also used as vaccines against antigen-associated disorders.

The induction of immunity by expression of the ZIKV antigen can be further confirmed by observing the induction of antibody production against the ZIKV antigen. For example, when antibodies against an antigen are induced in a laboratory animal immunized with the composition encoding the antigen, and when antigen-associated pathology is suppressed by those antibodies, the composition is determined to induce immunity.

The induction of immunity by expression of the ZIKV antigen can be further confirmed by observing the induction of CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also lyse target cells, but mainly supply help in the induction of other types of immune responses, including CTL and antibody generation. The type of CD4+ T cell help can be characterized, as Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, T regulatory, or T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Each subtype of CD4+ T cell supplies help to certain types of immune responses. In one embodiment, the composition selectively induces T follicular helper cells, which drive potent antibody responses.

The therapeutic compounds or compositions of the invention may be administered prophylactically (i.e., to prevent a disease or disorder) or therapeutically (i.e., to treat a disease or disorder) to subjects suffering from, or at risk of (or susceptible to) developing the disease or disorder. Such subjects may be identified using standard clinical methods. In the context of the present invention, prophylactic administration occurs prior to the manifestation of overt clinical symptoms of disease, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or alternatively delayed in its progression. In the context of the field of medicine, the term “prevent” encompasses any activity, which reduces the burden of mortality or morbidity from disease. Prevention can occur at primary, secondary and tertiary prevention levels. While primary prevention avoids the development of a disease, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention encompass activities aimed at preventing the progression of a disease and the emergence of symptoms as well as reducing the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications.

### Nucleic Acids

In one embodiment, the invention includes a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule encodes a ZIKV antigen. In one embodiment, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule encodes a plurality of antigens, including one or more ZIKV antigens. In certain embodiments, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule encodes a ZIKV antigen that induces an adaptive immune response against the ZIKV antigen. In one embodiment, the invention includes a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule encoding an adjuvant.

The nucleotide sequences encoding a ZIKV antigen or adjuvant, as described herein, can alternatively comprise sequence variations with respect to the original nucleotide sequences, for example, substitutions, insertions and/or deletions of one or more nucleotides, with the condition that the resulting polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide according to the invention. Therefore, the scope of the present invention includes nucleotide sequences that are substantially homologous to the nucleotide sequences recited herein and encode a ZIKV antigen or adjuvant of interest.

As used herein, a nucleotide sequence is “substantially homologous” to any of the nucleotide sequences described herein when its nucleotide sequence has a degree of identity with respect to the nucleotide sequence of at least 60%, of at least 65%, of at least 70%, of at least 65%, of at least 80%, of at least 85%, of at least 90%, of at least 95%, of at least 96%, of at least 97%, of at least 98%, or of at least 99%. A nucleotide sequence that is substantially homologous to a nucleotide sequence encoding an antigen can typically be isolated from a producer organism of the antigen based on the information contained in the nucleotide sequence by means of introducing conservative or non-conservative substitutions, for example. Other examples of possible modifications include the insertion of one or more nucleotides in the sequence, the addition of one or more nucleotides in any of the ends of the sequence, or the deletion of one or more nucleotides in any end or inside the sequence. The degree of identity between two polynucleotides is determined using computer algorithms and methods that are widely known for the persons skilled in the art.

Further, the scope of the invention includes nucleotide sequences that encode amino acid sequences that are substantially homologous to the amino acid sequences recited herein and preserve the immunogenic function of the original amino acid sequence.

As used herein, an amino acid sequence is “substantially homologous” to any of the amino acid sequences described herein when its amino acid sequence has a degree of identity with respect to the amino acid sequence of at least 60%, of at least 65%, of at least 70%, of at least 65%, of at least 80%, of at least 85%, of at least 90%, of at least 95%, of at least 96%, of at least 97%, of at least 98%, or of at least 99%. The identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined by using the BLASTN algorithm (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S., et al., NCBI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894, Altschul, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990)).

In one embodiment, the invention relates to a construct, comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a ZIKV antigen. In one embodiment, the construct comprises a plurality of nucleotide sequences encoding a plurality of ZIKV antigens. For example, in certain embodiments, the construct encodes 1 or more, 2 or more, 5 or more, or all 10 ZIKV antigens. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a construct, comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an adjuvant. In one embodiment, the construct comprises a first nucleotide sequence encoding a ZIKV antigen and a second nucleotide sequence encoding an adjuvant.

In one embodiment, the composition comprises a plurality of constructs, each construct encoding one or more ZIKV antigens. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises 1 or more, 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more, 5 or more, 6 or more, 7 or more, 8 or more, 9 or more, 10 or more, 15 or more, or 20 or more constructs. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a first construct, comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a ZIKV antigen; and a second construct, comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an adjuvant.

In another particular embodiment, the construct is operatively bound to a translational control element. The construct can incorporate an operatively bound regulatory sequence for the expression of the nucleotide sequence of the invention, thus forming an expression cassette.

Vectors

The nucleic acid sequences coding for the ZIKV antigen or adjuvant can be obtained using recombinant methods known in the art, such as, for example by screening libraries from cells expressing the gene, by deriving the gene from a vector known to include the same, or by isolating directly from cells and tissues containing the same, using standard techniques. Alternatively, the gene of interest can be produced synthetically.

The nucleic acid can be cloned into a number of types of vectors. For example, the nucleic acid can be cloned into a vector including, but not limited to a plasmid, a phagemid, a phage derivative, an animal virus, a PCR-generated linear DNA sequence, and a cosmid. Vectors of particular interest include expression vectors, replication vectors, probe generation vectors, sequencing vectors and vectors optimized for in vitro transcription.

Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, carbohydrates, peptides, cationic polymers, and liposomes. An exemplary colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (e.g., an artificial membrane vesicle).

In the case where a non-viral delivery system is utilized, an exemplary delivery vehicle is a liposome. The use of lipid formulations is contemplated for the introduction of the nucleic acids into a host cell (in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo). In another aspect, the nucleic acid may be associated with a lipid. The nucleic acid associated with a lipid may be encapsulated in the aqueous interior of a liposome, interspersed within the lipid bilayer of a liposome, attached to a liposome via a linking molecule that is associated with both the liposome and the oligonucleotide, entrapped in a liposome, complexed with a liposome, dispersed in a solution containing a lipid, mixed with a lipid, combined with a lipid, contained as a suspension in a lipid, contained or complexed with a micelle, or otherwise associated with a lipid. Lipid, lipid/RNA or lipid/expression vector associated compositions are not limited to any particular structure in solution. For example, they may be present in a bilayer structure, as micelles, or with a “collapsed” structure. They may also simply be interspersed in a solution, possibly forming aggregates that are not uniform in size or shape. Lipids are fatty substances which may be naturally occurring or synthetic lipids. For example, lipids include the fatty droplets that naturally occur in the cytoplasm as well as the class of compounds which contain long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, such as fatty acids, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, and aldehydes.

Lipids suitable for use can be obtained from commercial sources. For example, dimyristyl phosphatidylcholine (“DMPC”) can be obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; dicetyl phosphate (“DCP”) can be obtained from K & K Laboratories (Plainview, N.Y.); cholesterol (“Choi”) can be obtained from Calbiochem-Behring; dimyristyl phosphatidylglycerol (“DMPG”) and other lipids may be obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.). Stock solutions of lipids in chloroform or chloroform/methanol can be stored at about −20° C. Chloroform is used as the only solvent since it is more readily evaporated than methanol. “Liposome” is a generic term encompassing a variety of single and multilamellar lipid vehicles formed by the generation of enclosed lipid bilayers or aggregates. Liposomes can be characterized as having vesicular structures with a phospholipid bilayer membrane and an inner aqueous medium. Multilamellar liposomes have multiple lipid layers separated by aqueous medium. They form spontaneously when phospholipids are suspended in an excess of aqueous solution. The lipid components undergo self-rearrangement before the formation of closed structures and entrap water and dissolved solutes between the lipid bilayers (Ghosh et al., 1991 Glycobiology 5: 505-10). However, compositions that have different structures in solution than the normal vesicular structure are also encompassed. For example, the lipids may assume a micellar structure or merely exist as nonuniform aggregates of lipid molecules. Also contemplated are lipofectamine-nucleic acid complexes.

Regardless of the method used to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into a host cell or otherwise expose a cell to the inhibitor of the present invention, in order to confirm the presence of the mRNA sequence in the host cell, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for example, “molecular biological” assays well known to those of skill in the art, such as Northern blotting and RT-PCR; “biochemical” assays, such as detecting the presence or absence of a particular peptide, e.g., by immunogenic means (ELISAs and Western blots) or by assays described herein to identify agents falling within the scope of the invention.

In Vitro Transcribed RNA

In one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA encoding a ZIKV antigen. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises IVT RNA encoding a plurality of ZIKV antigens. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises IVT RNA encoding an adjuvant. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises IVT RNA encoding one or more ZIKV antigens and one or more adjuvants.

In one embodiment, an IVT RNA can be introduced to a cell as a form of transient transfection. The RNA is produced by in vitro transcription using a plasmid DNA template generated synthetically. DNA of interest from any source can be directly converted by PCR into a template for in vitro mRNA synthesis using appropriate primers and RNA polymerase. The source of the DNA can be, for example, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, phage DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA sequence or any other appropriate source of DNA. In one embodiment, the desired template for in vitro transcription is a ZIKV antigen capable of inducing an adaptive immune response. In one embodiment, the desired template for in vitro transcription is an adjuvant capable of enhancing an adaptive immune response.

In one embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR contains an open reading frame. The DNA can be from a naturally occurring DNA sequence from the genome of an organism. In one embodiment, the DNA is a full length gene of interest of a portion of a gene. The gene can include some or all of the 5′ and/or 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The gene can include exons and introns. In one embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is a human gene. In another embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is a human gene including the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. In another embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is a gene from a pathogenic or commensal organism, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. In another embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is from a pathogenic or commensal organism, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, including the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. The DNA can alternatively be an artificial DNA sequence that is not normally expressed in a naturally occurring organism. An exemplary artificial DNA sequence is one that contains portions of genes that are ligated together to form an open reading frame that encodes a fusion protein. The portions of DNA that are ligated together can be from a single organism or from more than one organism.

Genes that can be used as sources of DNA for PCR include genes that encode polypeptides that induce or enhance an adaptive immune response in an organism. In certain instances, the genes are useful for a short term treatment. In certain instances, the genes have limited safety concerns regarding dosage of the expressed gene.

In various embodiments, a plasmid is used to generate a template for in vitro transcription of mRNA, which is used for transfection.

Chemical structures with the ability to promote stability and/or translation efficiency may also be used. In certain embodiments, the RNA has 5′ and 3′ UTRs. In one embodiment, the 5′ UTR is between zero and 3000 nucleotides in length. The length of 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences to be added to the coding region can be altered by different methods, including, but not limited to, designing primers for PCR that anneal to different regions of the UTRs. Using this approach, one of ordinary skill in the art can modify the 5′ and 3′ UTR lengths required to achieve optimal translation efficiency following transfection of the transcribed RNA.

The 5′ and 3′ UTRs can be the naturally occurring, endogenous 5′ and 3′ UTRs for the gene of interest. Alternatively, UTR sequences that are not endogenous to the gene of interest can be added by incorporating the UTR sequences into the forward and reverse primers or by any other modifications of the template. The use of UTR sequences that are not endogenous to the gene of interest can be useful for modifying the stability and/or translation efficiency of the RNA. For example, it is known that AU-rich elements in 3′ UTR sequences can decrease the stability of mRNA. Therefore, 3′ UTRs can be selected or designed to increase the stability of the transcribed RNA based on properties of UTRs that are well known in the art.

In one embodiment, the 5′ UTR can contain the Kozak sequence of the endogenous gene. Alternatively, when a 5′ UTR that is not endogenous to the gene of interest is being added by PCR as described above, a consensus Kozak sequence can be redesigned by adding the 5′ UTR sequence. Kozak sequences can increase the efficiency of translation of some RNA transcripts, but does not appear to be required for all RNAs to enable efficient translation. The requirement for Kozak sequences for many mRNAs is known in the art. In other embodiments, the 5′ UTR can be derived from an RNA virus whose RNA genome is stable in cells. In other embodiments, various nucleotide analogues can be used in the 3′ or 5′ UTR to impede exonuclease degradation of the mRNA.

To enable synthesis of RNA from a DNA template without the need for gene cloning, a promoter of transcription should be attached to the DNA template upstream of the sequence to be transcribed. When a sequence that functions as a promoter for an RNA polymerase is added to the 5′ end of the forward primer, the RNA polymerase promoter becomes incorporated into the PCR product upstream of the open reading frame that is to be transcribed. In one embodiment, the promoter is a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, as described elsewhere herein. Other useful promoters include, but are not limited to, T3 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoters. Consensus nucleotide sequences for T7, T3 and SP6 promoters are known in the art.

In one embodiment, the mRNA has both a cap on the 5′ end and a 3′ poly(A) tail which determine ribosome binding, initiation of translation and stability mRNA in the cell. On a circular DNA template, for instance, plasmid DNA, RNA polymerase produces a long concatameric product, which is not suitable for expression in eukaryotic cells. The transcription of plasmid DNA linearized at the end of the 3′ UTR results in normal sized mRNA, which is effective in eukaryotic transfection when it is polyadenylated after transcription.

On a linear DNA template, phage T7 RNA polymerase can extend the 3′ end of the transcript beyond the last base of the template (Schenborn and Mierendorf, Nuc Acids Res., 13:6223-36 (1985); Nacheva and Berzal-Herranz, Eur. J. Biochem., 270:1485-65 (2003).

The conventional method of integration of polyA/T stretches into a DNA template is molecular cloning. However, polyA/T sequence integrated into plasmid DNA can cause plasmid instability, which can be ameliorated through the use of recombination incompetent bacterial cells for plasmid propagation.

Poly(A) tails of RNAs can be further extended following in vitro transcription with the use of a poly(A) polymerase, such as E. coli polyA polymerase (E-PAP) or yeast polyA polymerase. In one embodiment, increasing the length of a poly(A) tail from 100 nucleotides to between 300 and 400 nucleotides results in about a two-fold increase in the translation efficiency of the RNA. Additionally, the attachment of different chemical groups to the 3′ end can increase mRNA stability. Such attachment can contain modified/artificial nucleotides, aptamers and other compounds. For example, ATP analogs can be incorporated into the poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. ATP analogs can further increase the stability of the RNA.

5′ caps on also provide stability to mRNA molecules. In one embodiment, RNAs produced by the methods to include a 5′ cap1 structure. Such cap1 structure can be generated using Vaccinia capping enzyme and 2′-O-methyltransferase enzymes (CellScript, Madison, Wis.). Alternatively, 5′ cap is provided using techniques known in the art and described herein (Cougot, et al., Trends in Biochem. Sci., 29:436-444 (2001); Stepinski, et al., RNA, 7:1468-95 (2001); Elango, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun., 330:958-966 (2005)).

RNA can be introduced into target cells using any of a number of different methods, for instance, commercially available methods which include, but are not limited to, electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector-II (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany)), (ECM 830 (BTX) (Harvard Instruments, Boston, Mass.) or the Gene Pulser II (BioRad, Denver, Colo.), Multiporator (Eppendort, Hamburg Germany), cationic liposome mediated transfection using lipofection, polymer encapsulation, peptide mediated transfection, or biolistic particle delivery systems such as “gene guns” (see, for example, Nishikawa, et al. Hum Gene Ther., 12(8):861-70 (2001). In certain embodiments RNA of the invention is introduced to a cell with a method comprising the use of TransIT®-mRNA transfection Kit (Mirus, Madison Wis.), which, in some instances, provides high efficiency, low toxicity, transfection.

Nucleoside-Modified RNA

In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid encoding a ZIKV antigen as described herein. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid encoding a plurality of antigens, including one or more ZIKV antigens. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid encoding an adjuvant as described herein. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises a nucleoside-modified nucleic acid encoding one or more ZIKV antigens and one or more adjuvants.

For example, in one embodiment, the composition comprises a nucleoside-modified RNA. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a nucleoside-modified mRNA. Nucleoside-modified mRNA have particular advantages over non-modified mRNA, including for example, increased stability, low or absent innate immunogenicity, and enhanced translation. Nucleoside-modified mRNA useful in the present invention is further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,278,036, 8,691,966, and 8,835,108, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In certain embodiments, nucleoside-modified mRNA does not activate any pathophysiologic pathways, translates very efficiently and almost immediately following delivery, and serve as templates for continuous protein production in vivo lasting for several days (Karikó et al., 2008, Mol Ther 16:1833-1840; Karikó et al., 2012, Mol Ther 20:948-953). The amount of mRNA required to exert a physiological effect is small and that makes it applicable for human therapy. For example, as described herein, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a ZIKV antigen has demonstrated the ability to antigen-specific antibody production. For example, in certain instances, antigen encoded by nucleoside-modified mRNA induces greater production of antigen-specific antibody production as compared to antigen encoded by non-modified mRNA.

In certain instances, expressing a protein by delivering the encoding mRNA has many benefits over methods that use protein, plasmid DNA or viral vectors. During mRNA transfection, the coding sequence of the desired protein is the only substance delivered to cells, thus avoiding all the side effects associated with plasmid backbones, viral genes, and viral proteins. More importantly, unlike DNA- and viral-based vectors, the mRNA does not carry the risk of being incorporated into the genome and protein production starts immediately after mRNA delivery. For example, high levels of circulating proteins have been measured within 15 to 30 minutes of in vivo injection of the encoding mRNA. In certain embodiments, using mRNA rather than the protein also has many advantages. Half-lives of proteins in the circulation are often short, thus protein treatment would need frequent dosing, while mRNA provides a template for continuous protein production for several days. Purification of proteins is problematic and they can contain aggregates and other impurities that cause adverse effects (Kromminga and Schellekens, 2005, Ann NY Acad Sci 1050:257-265).

In certain embodiments, the nucleoside-modified RNA comprises the naturally occurring modified-nucleoside pseudouridine. In certain embodiments, inclusion of pseudouridine makes the mRNA more stable, non-immunogenic, and highly translatable (Karikó et al., 2008, Mol Ther 16:1833-1840; Anderson et al., 2010, Nucleic Acids Res 38:5884-5892; Anderson et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Research 39:9329-9338; Karikó et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Research 39:e142; Karikó et al., 2012, Mol Ther 20:948-953; Karikó et al., 2005, Immunity 23:165-175).

It has been demonstrated that the presence of modified nucleosides, including pseudouridines in RNA suppress their innate immunogenicity (Karikó et al., 2005, Immunity 23:165-175). Further, protein-encoding, in vitro-transcribed RNA containing pseudouridine can be translated more efficiently than RNA containing no or other modified nucleosides (Karikó et al., 2008, Mol Ther 16:1833-1840). Subsequently, it is shown that the presence of pseudouridine improves the stability of RNA (Anderson et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Research 39:9329-9338) and abates both activation of PKR and inhibition of translation (Anderson et al., 2010, Nucleic Acids Res 38:5884-5892).

In certain embodiments, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule is a purified nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule. For example, in certain embodiments, the composition is purified to remove double-stranded contaminants. In certain instances, a preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification procedure is used to obtain pseudouridine-containing RNA that has superior translational potential and no innate immunogenicity (Karikó et al., 2011, Nucleic Acids Research 39:e142). Administering HPLC-purified, pseudourine-containing RNA coding for erythropoietin into mice and macaques resulted in a significant increase of serum EPO levels (Karikó et al., 2012, Mol Ther 20:948-953), thus confirming that pseudouridine-containing mRNA is suitable for in vivo protein therapy. In certain embodiments, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule is purified using non-HPLC methods. In certain instances, the nucleoside-modified nucleic acid molecule is purified using chromatography methods, including but not limited to HPLC and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). An exemplary FPLC-based purification procedure is described in Weissman et al., 2013, Methods Mol Biol, 969: 43-54. Exemplary purification procedures are also described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2016/0032316, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

They have, in another embodiment, an internal aqueous space for entrapping water-soluble compounds and range in size from 0.05 to several microns in diameter. In another embodiment, liposomes can deliver RNA to cells in a biologically active form.

In one embodiment, the composition comprises a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and one or more nucleic acid molecules described herein. For example, in one embodiment, the composition comprises an LNP and one or more nucleoside-modified RNA molecules encoding one or more antigens, adjuvants, or a combination thereof.

The term “lipid nanoparticle” refers to a particle having at least one dimension on the order of nanometers (e.g., 1-1,000 nm), which includes one or more lipids, for example a lipid of Formula (I), (II) or (III). In some embodiments, lipid nanoparticles are included in a formulation comprising a nucleoside-modified RNA as described herein. In some embodiments, such lipid nanoparticles comprise a cationic lipid (e.g., a lipid of Formula (I), (II) or (III)) and one or more excipient selected from neutral lipids, charged lipids, steroids and polymer conjugated lipids (e.g., a pegylated lipid such as a pegylated lipid of structure (IV), such as compound Iva). In some embodiments, the nucleoside-modified RNA is encapsulated in the lipid portion of the lipid nanoparticle or an aqueous space enveloped by some or all of the lipid portion of the lipid nanoparticle, thereby protecting it from enzymatic degradation or other undesirable effects induced by the mechanisms of the host organism or cells, e.g., an adverse immune response.

In various embodiments, the lipid nanoparticles have a mean diameter of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, from about 50 nm to about 150 nm, from about 60 nm to about 130 nm, from about 70 nm to about 110 nm, from about 70 nm to about 100 nm, from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, from about 90 nm to about 100 nm, from about 70 to about 90 nm, from about 80 nm to about 90 nm, from about 70 nm to about 80 nm, or about 30 nm, 35 nm, 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, 110 nm, 115 nm, 120 nm, 125 nm, 130 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm, 145 nm, or 150 nm, and are substantially non-toxic. In certain embodiments, the nucleoside-modified RNA, when present in the lipid nanoparticles, is resistant in aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease.

The LNP may comprise any lipid capable of forming a particle to which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are attached, or in which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are encapsulated. The term “lipid” refers to a group of organic compounds that are derivatives of fatty acids (e.g., esters) and are generally characterized by being insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. Lipids are usually divided in at least three classes: (1) “simple lipids” which include fats and oils as well as waxes; (2) “compound lipids” which include phospholipids and glycolipids; and (3) “derived lipids” such as steroids.

In one embodiment, the LNP comprises one or more cationic lipids, and one or more stabilizing lipids. Stabilizing lipids include neutral lipids and pegylated lipids.

In one embodiment, the LNP comprises a cationic lipid. As used herein, the term “cationic lipid” refers to a lipid that is cationic or becomes cationic (protonated) as the pH is lowered below the pK of the ionizable group of the lipid, but is progressively more neutral at higher pH values. At pH values below the pK, the lipid is then able to associate with negatively charged nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, the cationic lipid comprises a zwitterionic lipid that assumes a positive charge on pH decrease.

In certain embodiments, the cationic lipid comprises any of a number of lipid species which carry a net positive charge at a selective pH, such as physiological pH. Such lipids include, but are not limited to, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC); N-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA); N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB); N-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP); 3-(N—(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)cholesterol (DC-Chol), N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N-2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium trifluoracetate (DOSPA), dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine (DOGS), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane (DODAP), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleoyloxy)propylamine (DODMA), and N-(1,2-dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide (DMRIE). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids are available which can be used in the present invention. These include, for example, LIPOFECTIN® (commercially available cationic liposomes comprising DOTMA and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), from GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.); LIPOFECTAMINE® (commercially available cationic liposomes comprising N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N-(2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium trifluoroacetate (DOSPA) and (DOPE), from GIBCO/BRL); and TRANSFECTAM® (commercially available cationic lipids comprising dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine (DOGS) in ethanol from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.).

Reaction of F-4 with amine F-5 under reductive amination conditions yields a lipid of Formula (III).

It should be noted that various alternative strategies for preparation of lipids of Formula (III) are available to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, other lipids of Formula (III) wherein L1 and L2 are other than ester can be prepared according to analogous methods using the appropriate starting material. Further, General Reaction Scheme 6 depicts preparation of a lipids of Formula (III), wherein G1 and G2 are the same; however, this is not a required aspect of the invention and modifications to the above reaction scheme are possible to yield compounds wherein G1 and G2 are different.

### Example 1: Zika Virus Protection by a Single Low-Dose Nucleoside-Modified mRNA Vaccination

It is demonstrated herein that a single low-dose intradermal immunization with lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) glycoproteins of a 2013 ZIKV outbreak strain elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice and non-human primates. Immunization with 30 μg of nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNPs protected mice from ZIKV challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months post-vaccination, and a single dose of 50 μg was sufficient to protect non-human primates from a challenge at 5 weeks post-vaccination. These data demonstrate that nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs elicits rapid and durable protective immunity and thus represents a new and promising vaccine candidate for the global fight against ZIKV.

The methods and materials employed in these experiments are now described.

Antibody Reagents

The pan-flavivirus murine monoclonal antibody 4G2, clone D1-4G2-4-15 (EMD Millipore MAB10216) was used to detect ZIKV E protein by Western blot. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometry: anti-CD4 PerCP/Cy5.5 (Clone GK1.5, Biolegend), anti-CD3 APC-Cy7 (Clone 145-2C11, BD Biosciences), anti-CD27 PE (Clone LG.3A10, BD Biosciences), anti-TNF-α PE-Cy7 (Clone MP6-XT22, BD Biosciences), anti-IFN-γ AF700 (Clone XMG1.2, BD Biosciences), anti-IL-2 APC (Clone JES6-5H4, BD Biosciences). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) was used to discriminate dead cells and debris. The following antibodies were used for ELISA assays: goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (Sigma 4416), goat anti-monkey IgG HRP (Sigma 2054), and ZIKV E protein-binding mAb NR-4747 clone E19 (BEI Resources).

Protein Reagents

Purified recombinant ZIKV E protein (Aalto Bioreagents AZ 6312) was used in ELISAs to detect E protein-specific IgG, in Western blots as a positive control and in mouse splenocyte stimulation.

mRNA Production

mRNA was produced as previously described (Pardi et al, 2013, Methods Mol Biol, 969, 29-42) using T7 RNA polymerase on linearized plasmid (pTEV-ZIKVprM-E-A101) encoding codon-optimized (Thess et al., 2015, Mol Ther, 23: 1456-1464) ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (GenBank: KJ776791) prM-E glycoproteins. mRNA was transcribed to contain 101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tails. 1-methylpseudouridine-5′-triphosphate (TriLink) instead of UTP was used to generate modified nucleoside-containing mRNA. mRNA was capped using the m7G capping kit with 2′-O-methyltransferase to obtain cap1 and was purified by a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) method, as described (Weissman et al., 2013, Methods Mol Biol, 969: 43-54). mRNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and stored frozen at −20° C.

Cell Culture

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone) (complete medium). The 293T cell line was checked for mycoplasma contamination after receipt for the ATCC and before expansion and cryopreservation. Human dendritic cells (huDCs) were generated from monocytes, as described (Kariko et al, 2008, Mol Ther, 16: 1833-1840), and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone) (complete medium) supplemented with 50 g/ml recombinant human GM-CSF and 100 μg/ml recombinant human IL-4 (R&D systems). Cells were maintained by adding fresh medium containing IL-4 and GM-CSF every 3 days and used on day 7. Murine dendritic cells (muDCs) were generated from bone marrow cells obtained from the femurs of animals and grown in complete medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml murine GM-CSF (R&D systems). Cells were maintained by adding fresh medium containing murine GM-CSF every 3 days and used on day 7.

mRNA Transfection

Transfection of human and murine DCs and HEK 293T cells was performed with TransIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer instructions: mRNA (0.3 μg) was combined with TransIT-mRNA Reagent (0.34 μl) and Boost Reagent (0.22 μl) in 17 μl of serum free medium, and the complex was added to 2×105 cells in 183 μl complete medium. Supernatant was collected and cells were lysed for 1 hour on ice in RIPA buffer (Sigma) at 18 hours post-transfection.

Western Blot Analysis of Envelope Protein Expression

Whole cell lysates and supernatants from ZIKV prM-E transfected cells were assayed for ZIKV E protein by non-denaturing SDS-PAGE Western blot. Samples were combined with 4× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and separated on a 4-15% precast polyacrylamide Criterion TGX gel (Bio-Rad) for 45 minutes at 200 V. Transfer to PVDF membrane was performed using a semi-dry apparatus (Ellard Instrumentation, Ltd.) at 10V for 1 hour. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer containing 0.5% Tween-20. E protein was detected using 1:10,000 4G2 ascites for 1 hour, followed by secondary goat anti-mouse IgG HRP 1:10,000 for 1 hour. Antibody incubations were performed at room temperature in blocking buffer. Blots were developed using Luminata Forte substrate (Millipore) and a Kodak X-OMAT 1000A processor. At least 2 independent experiments were performed.

Characterization of E Protein in Supernatant

Supernatant from HEK 293T cells transfected with ZIKV prM-E mRNA was tested for whether E protein could be pelleted and disrupted with detergent, consistent with subviral particles. Supernatant was incubated in PBS alone or PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 hour on ice. Samples were then spun at 42,000 rpm for 2.5 hours in a Beckman TLA-55 rotor. The supernatant was then removed from the pellet, which was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. Equal volumes of the input, pellet, and post-centrifugation supernatant fractions were then analyzed by Western blot, as described elsewhere herein.

Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Formulation of the mRNA

FPLC-purified mRNAs and polycytidylic acid (poly(C) RNA) (Sigma) were encapsulated in LNPs using a self-assembly process in which an aqueous solution of mRNA at pH 4.0 is rapidly mixed with a solution of lipids dissolved in ethanol (Maier et al., 2013, Mol Ther, 21: 1570-1578). LNPs used in this study were similar in composition to those described previously (Maier et al., 2013, Mol Ther, 21: 1570-1578; Jayaraman et al., 2012, Angew Chem Int Ed Engl, 51: 8529-8533), which contain an ionizable cationic lipid (proprietary to Acuitas)/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG-lipid (50:10:38.5:1.5 mol/mol) and were encapsulated at an RNA to total lipid ratio of ˜0.05 (wt/wt). They had a diameter of −80 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) instrument. RNA-LNP formulations were stored at −80° C. at a concentration of RNA of ˜1 μg/l.

Administration of LNPs to Mice and Rhesus Monkeys

Mice: Female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, and cages of mice were randomly allocated to groups. Power analysis was used to calculate the size of all animal groups to ensure statistically significant results. mRNA-LNPs were diluted in PBS and injected into animals intradermally with a 3/10cc 29½G insulin syringe (BD Biosciences). Four sites of injection (30 μl each) over the lower back were used.

Monkeys: Ketamine anesthetized animals were shaved on their back and injected with mRNA-LNPs diluted in PBS. Ten sites of injection (60 μl each) were used. Animals of similar age and weight were randomly designated to dose groups.

Blood Collection from Mice and Rhesus Monkeys

Mice: Blood was collected from the orbital sinus under isoflurane anesthesia. Blood was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm and the serum was stored at −20° C. and used for ELISA and virus neutralization assays. EDTA-plasma was collected to isolate RNA for qRT-PCR analysis.

Monkeys: Blood was collected by femoral venipuncture under ketamine anesthesia, and serum and EDTA-plasma were collected and stored at −80° C. for ELISA, neutralization analysis, and to isolate RNA for qRT-PCR.

Stimulation and Staining of Splenocytes

Single cell suspensions from spleens were made in complete medium. Splenocytes were washed once in PBS and resuspended in complete medium at 2×107 cells/ml. 2×106 cells (100 μl) per sample were stimulated for 6 hours at 37° C. using 2 μg/ml purified recombinant ZIKV virus E protein. Golgi Plug (brefeldin A, BD Biosciences) and Golgi Stop (monensin, BD Biosciences) were diluted 1:100 and 1:143 in complete medium, respectively, and 20 μl from both diluted reagents were added to each sample to inhibit the secretion of intracellular cytokines after 1 hour. An unstimulated sample for each animal was included. PMA (10 ng/ml)-ionomycin (250 ng/ml) (Sigma) stimulated samples were used as positive controls.

After stimulation, cells were washed in PBS and stained using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) and then surface stained for CD4 and CD27. Antibodies were incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature. Following surface staining, cells were washed in FACS buffer and fixed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following fixation, the cells were washed in the appropriate perm buffer and incubated with antibodies against CD3, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-2 for 1 hour at room temperature. Following staining, the cells were washed with the appropriate perm buffer, fixed (PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde) and stored at 4° C. until analysis. Results are obtained from one technical replicate.

Flow Cytometry

Splenocytes were analyzed on a modified LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). One hundred thousand events were collected per sample. After the gates for each function were created, the Boolean gate platform was used to create the full array of possible combination of cytokines, equating to seven response patterns when testing three functions. Data were expressed by subtracting the percent positive unstimulated cells from the percent positive cells stimulated with E protein.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) for ZIKV E-Specific IgG

Immulon 4HXB ELISA plates were coated with 6 μg/ml purified recombinant ZIKV E protein in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4° C. The plate was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 hour, and washed three times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20). Mouse or rhesus macaque sera were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated on the plate for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by four washes. Secondary antibody HRP conjugate was diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer and incubated on the plate for 1 hour, followed by four washes. TMB substrate (KPL) was applied to the plate and the reaction was stopped with 2 Normal sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an MRX Revelation microplate reader. ZIKV E-protein-specific IgG was analyzed in two ways: as an endpoint dilution titer, defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give an OD greater than the sum of the background OD plus 0.01 units; and as an estimate of the absolute IgG concentration, which was based on the murine mAb NR-4747 as a standard (applicable only to mouse samples). All samples were run at least in technical duplicates.

ZIKV MR-766 Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNT)

ZIKV strain MR-766 (African lineage, Uganda, 1947, GenBank: AY632535) (UTMB Arbovirus Reference Collection) was produced in Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) and 50 plaque forming units were incubated with increasing dilutions of heat-inactivated sera in serum-free DMEM (Corning) medium for 1 hour at 37° C. The virus/serum mixture (200 μl) was added to a confluent monolayer of Vero cells in 6-well format and incubated for 1.5 hour at 37° C. with intermittent rocking. Then, 3 ml of overlay, containing a final concentration of 0.5% methylcellulose (4,000 centipoise) (Sigma), 1×DMEM (Gibco), 16 mM HEPES, 0.56% sodium bicarbonate, 1.6× GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Corning), and 4 μg/ml amphotericin B (Gibco), was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 5 days at 37° C. in 5% CO2. The overlay was aspirated and cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma) in 25% methanol, 75% deionized water. Wells were rinsed with deionized water to visualize plaques. Neutralization titers (EC50) were determined by plotting a line through the linear portion of the curve that crossed 50% inhibition and calculating the reciprocal dilution of serum required for 50% neutralization of infection. EC50 titers are reported as the mean of one or two technical replicates and values below the limit of detection are reported as half of the limit of detection.

ZIKV MEX I-44 Focus Reduction Neutralization Tests (FRNT)

ZIKV MEX I-44 (Asian lineage, Mexico, 2016, GenBank: KX856011) stocks were generated via propagation in Vero 76 (ATCC CRL-1587) cells and harvested as clarified cell culture lysate/supernatant. Stock titers were quantified via standard focus forming assay. FRNT was performed by combining a standard dose of ZIKV with two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum for one hour at 37° C. Virus-serum mixtures (100 μl) were then inoculated onto Vero 76 monolayers, incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour and overlayed with an Avicel (FMC Biopolymer)-containing growth medium. After 3 days of incubation, plates were formalin-fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and stained via sequential incubation with biotin-conjugated 4G2 mAb (ATCC HB-112), streptavidin-HRP (BD Biosciences) and TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (KPL). Virus input was verified in parallel (acceptable range: 20-60 foci). FRNT50 (EC50 titers) are reported as the highest reciprocal dilution giving a focus count ≤the 50% neutralization cutoff, and the geometric mean was computed for technical duplicates.

Reporter Virus Particle (RVP) Production

Pseudo-infectious RVPs were produced by complementation of a GFP-expressing WNV sub-genomic replicon (Dowd et al., 2016, Cell Rep, 16: 1485-1491; Pierson et al., 2006, Virology, 346: 53-65) with a plasmid encoding the viral structural proteins (capsid-prM-E). Briefly, ZIKV MR-766 and ZIKV H/PF/2013 RVPs were produced via co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with the structural gene and replicon plasmids (3:1 ratio by mass) using Lipofectamine 3000 per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were incubated at 30° C. and RVP-containing supernatants harvested on days 3-6. Stocks were passed through a 0.2 m filter and aliquots stored at −80° C. until use. Stock titers were determined by infecting Raji-DCSIGNR cells with serial dilutions of filtered RVP supernatants. GFP-positive cells were assessed by flow cytometry at 48 hours post-infection and RVP titers calculated.

RVP Neutralization Assay

Previously titered RVPs were diluted to ensure antibody excess at informative points on the dose-response curves and incubated with serial dilutions of mouse or macaque sera for 1 hour at 37° C. to allow for steady-state binding. Raji-DCSIGNR cells were then infected with antibody-RVP complexes in duplicate technical replicates. Infections were carried out at 37° C. and GFP-positive infected cells detected by flow cytometry 24-48 hours later. Neutralization results were analyzed by non-linear regression to estimate the reciprocal dilution of sera required for half-maximal neutralization of infection (EC50 titer) (Prism 6, GraphPad). The initial dilution of sera (based on the final volume of RVPs, cells, and sera) was set as the limit of confidence of the assay. Titers for which non-linear regression was predicted to be below this threshold were reported as a titer half the limit of confidence. Individual EC50 titers are reported as the geometric mean of at least 2 technical replicates.

Preparation of Challenge ZIKV Virus

Mice: Challenge ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (Asian Lineage, Puerto Rico, 2016, GenBank: KU501215) (BEI Resources NR-50240) was grown in Vero CCL81 cells. A T175 flask at 75-90% confluency was inoculated with an MOI of 0.01 ZIKV in 10 ml of serum-free DMEM medium. The flask was incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 1.5 hours with intermittent gentle rocking, then warmed media was added to a final concentration of 1.5% FCS, 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Corning) in a final volume of 25 ml. The flask was incubated for 4 days or until cytopathic effects were visible. Then supernatant was collected and ultra-centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 hours at 4° C. in a Sorvall SureSpin 630 rotor. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM, aliquoted, and stored at −80° C. Before challenge, virus was thawed and diluted in PBS to 2,000 PFU/ml.

Monkeys: Challenge ZIKV strain PRVABC59 was grown in Vero76 CRL-1587 cells. T150 flasks at 80-85% confluency were used for propagation. Infection was performed with 100 μl stock virus diluted in 4 ml of fresh L-15 media (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma Aldrich), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and L-glutamine (Gibco) and adsorbed for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation every 15 minutes. Each flask received 7 ml of fresh L-15 media after adsorption and was incubated for 4 days at 37° C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C. in an Eppendorf A-4-62 rotor. Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80° C.

Zika Virus Challenge in Mice and Rhesus Monkeys

Mice: Two or 20 weeks after vaccination, mice were bled and then challenged intravenously with 200 PFU of ZIKV-PR (PRVABC59) in 100 μl of PBS. Blood was collected 3, 5 and 7 days post-challenge to determine viral loads (ZIKV RNA copies per ml) in plasma.

Monkeys: Macaques were anesthetized with ketamine and injected subcutaneously in the hind thigh with 104 TCID50 of ZIKV-PR in a volume of 1 ml in PBS. Blood was collected 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the challenge to determine viral loads (ZIKV RNA copies per ml) in plasma.

Viral Load Quantification (qRT-PCR)

Using blinded samples, RNA was isolated from 200 μl (macaque) or 50 μl (mouse) of plasma using the QIAamp MinElute Virus spin kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was used for amplification using the SensiFAST Probe Lo-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline BIO-78005) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probe were designed to amplify a conserved region of the capsid gene from ZIKV BeH815744, as follows: Fwd: GGAAAAAAGAGGCTATGGAAATAATAAAG (SEQ ID NO: 3); Rev: CTCCTTCCTAGCATTGATTATTCTCA (SEQ ID NO: 4); probe: AGTTCAAGAAAGATCTGGCTG (SEQ ID NO: 5). Primers and probe were used at a final concentration of 2 μM, and the following program was run: 48° C. for 30 minutes, 95° C. for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95° C. for 15 seconds and 1 minute at 60° C. Assay sensitivity was 50 copies/ml for macaque and 200 copies/ml for mouse samples. Results are calculated from at least two technical replicates.

Statistical Analysis

GraphPad Prism 5.0f was used to perform Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis (with Dunn's correction) tests to compare immune responses in vaccinated and control mice and in different dose groups of macaques, respectively. SPICE 5.35 and Microsoft Excel software was used to perform Student's t-tests to compare T cell responses in vaccinated and control mice.

The results of the experiments are now described.

mRNA has emerged as a promising new vaccine modality that can elicit potent immune responses (reviewed in Weissman, 2015, Expert Rev Vaccines, 14: 265-281 and Sahin et al., 2014, Nat Rev Drug Discov, 13: 759-780), while avoiding the safety risks and anti-vector immunity associated with some live virus vaccines (reviewed in Minor, 2015, Virology, 479-480: 379-392). Vaccination with mRNA offers several advantages over other vaccine platforms: (I) it is a non-infectious gene vector that can be readily designed to express any protein with high efficiency, (II) mRNA does not integrate into the host genome, (III) it has the potential for cost-effective and highly scalable manufacturing, and (IV) small doses are sufficient to induce protective immune responses.

Presented herein is the design of a novel, potent anti-ZIKV vaccine in which the prM-E glycoproteins of ZIKV H/PF/2013 (an Asian-lineage isolate from French Polynesia, 2013) (Baronti et al., 2014, Genome Announc, 2) were encoded by mRNA containing the modified nucleoside 1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ), which prevents innate immune sensing and increases mRNA translation in vivo (Andries et al., 2015, J Control Release, 217: 337-344). Nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA was formulated for vaccination in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which have been shown to mediate efficient and prolonged protein expression in vivo (Pardi et al, 2015, J Control Release, 217: 345-351). Studies of ZIKV and other flaviviruses have demonstrated that co-expression of prM and E proteins is sufficient to assemble and secrete subviral particles (Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354: 237-240; Wang et al., 2009, PLoS One 4: e8325). ZIKV prM-E-encoding mRNA was first characterized in vitro by transfecting HEK 293T cells and human and murine dendritic cells (DCs) (FIG. 5A). ZIKV E protein was produced by all three cell types and was secreted into the supernatant of 293T cells (FIG. 5B and FIG. 6). It was examined whether DCs also secrete E protein and whether it is rapidly endocytosed, as has been proposed for HIV gag (Weissman et al., 2000, J Immunol, 165: 4710-4717). To test whether E protein in 293T cell supernatant exhibited properties of subviral particles, the transfection supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation and probed the input, pellet, and resulting supernatant fractions for E protein. All E protein secreted from 293T cells was pelleted when incubated with PBS, but not with 0.5% Triton X-100, consistent with particle production by prM-E mRNA (Wang et al., 2009, PLoS One 4: e8325) (FIG. 5C).

The immune response induced by the nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNP vaccine was first evaluated in C57BL/6 mice. Animals were intradermally (i.d.) immunized with 30 μg of ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNPs or poly(C) RNA-LNP (negative control). No inflammation or other adverse events were observed at the sites of injection. Polyfunctional E protein-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detected based on intracellular IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 production by ZIKV E protein-stimulated splenocytes at week 2 post-vaccination (FIG. 1A and FIG. 7). ZIKV E-specific serum IgG developed quickly in ZIKV mRNA-vaccinated mice and stabilized at an endpoint titer of 180,000 (˜90 μg/ml) at weeks 8 to 12 (FIG. 1B and FIG. 8A). Anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were measured using two independent assays: a standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a ZIKV reporter viral particle (RVP) assay (Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354: 237-240). The mean PRNT50 titer against ZIKV MR-766 (African lineage, Uganda, 1947) peaked at ˜1,300 at week 8 (FIG. 1C) and was relatively stable, with only a 2-fold reduction at week 12. The mean RVP NAb titer (EC50) against ZIKV H/PF/2013 reached ˜105 at weeks 8 and 12 (FIG. 1D). The detection of higher neutralization titers in the RVP assay relative to PRNT is consistent with a previous comparison of ZIKV neutralization assay (Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354: 237-240). In addition, it was noted that the ratio of RVP to PRNT titers was not fixed and varies with the animal model and viral stock.

Immunogenicity of the same dose of nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP was next evaluated in BALB/c mice. E-specific serum IgG peaked at week 8 and remained stable between weeks 12 and 20 (endpoint titers˜200,000; 90-130 μg/ml) (FIG. 1E and FIG. 8B). PRNT50 NAb increased to a maximum of 1,300 at week 16 and remained stable until week 20 (FIG. 1F). The RVP NAb titer rose to 50,000 at week 8 and remained above 20,000 until week 20 (FIG. 1G).

A challenge study was conducted in BALB/c mice immunized with 30 μg of nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNPs or poly(C) RNA-LNPs. Mice were intravenously (i.v.) challenged at week 2 (short-term) or week 20 (long-term) post-immunization with 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZIKV PRVABC59 (Asian lineage, Puerto Rico, 2015). In the short-term protection study, 8 of 9 control mice developed viremia by day 3, with a median peak of ˜14,000 copies/ml. All ZIKV mRNA-immunized mice (n=9) were protected from detectable viremia (FIG. 2A). In the long-term study, all control mice (n=5) showed viremia on day 3, with a median peak of 1,200 copies/ml, while none of the ZIKV mRNA-immunized mice (n=10) had viremia at any time point tested (FIG. 2B). These data demonstrate that a single immunization with nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP elicits durable protection from detectable viremia with a heterologous ZIKV strain in mice.

Next, the efficacy of the nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNP vaccine was evaluated in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), a non-human primate species that recapitulates several features of ZIKV infection in humans (Dudley et al, 2016, Nat Commun 7, 12204). Macaques were immunized by intradermal injection with doses of 600 μg, 200 μg or 50 μg of ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNPs. Similar to mice, no inflammation or other adverse events were observed at the sites of injection. E-protein-specific IgG and NAb were efficiently induced by all three vaccine doses, with no statistically significant differences between groups. Endpoint IgG titers rose to >300,000 in all groups by week 4 and were maintained at ≥100,000 until week 12 (FIG. 3A). PRNT50 NAb titers against MR-766 peaked at ˜400 at week 2 (FIG. 10A), and stabilized at ˜200 at weeks 4 through 12. To facilitate comparison of NAb titers across laboratories, the neutralization curve is shown for a human anti-ZIKV neutralizing mAb, A3594, in the PRNT assay (FIG. 9). NAb titers obtained with a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), which has a format similar to PRNT, were stable around 400 against ZIKV MEX I-44 (Asian lineage, Mexico, 2016) at weeks 2 and 4 (FIG. 3B). The RVP assay revealed NAb titers against H/PF/2013 of ˜10,000 at week 2 and ˜17,000 at week 4 (FIG. 3C), and a titer of ˜3,000 against MR-766 at week 4 (FIG. 10B). The neutralization of both Asian- and African-lineage viruses is consistent with a prior report demonstrating the existence of only one serotype of ZIKV (Dowd et al., 2016, Cell Rep, 16: 1485-1491). The absence of a significant dose-dependent effect on the antibody response elicited by the nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP vaccine in any assay (Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.05) suggests that a low dose of 50 μg (approximately 0.02 mg/kg) was sufficient, or possibly more than sufficient, to induce robust anti-ZIKV immunity in macaques.

Rhesus macaques were challenged at week 5 by subcutaneously (s.c.) injecting 104 TCID50 of ZIKV-PRVABC59 into five vaccinated animals and six unvaccinated control animals (Table 4). All control animals became infected, and median peak plasma viremia was 7,000 ZIKV RNA copies/ml (FIG. 4). In contrast, vaccinated macaques were highly protected from ZIKV infection. Four of five animals—including three that received the lowest dose of 50 μg and one that received the medium dose of 200 μg—were completely protected with no detectable viremia (<50 copies/ml) at all time points.

In this report, it is demonstrated that a single, low-dose intradermal immunization with nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP is protective in both mice and rhesus macaques and elicits higher NAb responses than a single immunization of multiple recently reported ZIKV vaccine candidates, including purified inactivated virus (PIV) and plasmid DNA vaccines encoding prM-E or M-E (Larocca et al., 2016, Nature, 536: 474-478; Abbink et al., 2016, Science, 353, 1129-1132; Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354, 237-240). In mice, PRNT50 NAb increased steadily over several months, rising to levels 50-100 times higher than those induced by a single immunization with PIV or DNA vaccines (Larocca et al., 2016, Nature, 536: 474-478; Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354, 237-240). The ZIKV mRNA-LNP vaccine conferred complete, rapid, and durable protection in mice that was maintained for at least 5 months, and likely much longer, since NAb titers were stable. The mouse challenge studies also revealed that ZIKV PRVABC59 replicated much more efficiently (p=0.02, Mann-Whitney test) in 8-week-old BALB/c mice compared to 25-week-old mice, when two identical aliquots and doses of challenge virus stock were used. A prior report has shown that ZIKV-related mortality in immune-competent mice decreases between 1 and 4 weeks of age (Lazear et al., 2016, Cell Host Microbe, 19: 720-730), but ZIKV replication in adult mice has not yet been well described. This result may be relevant to future ZIKV vaccine testing in mice and to the understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis.

In rhesus macaques, a single immunization with 50 μg ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP induced RVP NAb titers that were 50 times higher than those induced by one immunization of 1 mg DNA vaccine and over 2 times higher than those induced by two immunizations of DNA (Dowd et al., 2016, Science, 354, 237-240) using the same assay run by the same lab with an identical positive control. ZIKV mRNA-LNP NAb titers may overlap with those elicited by one injection of PIV or RhAd52 ZIKV vaccines in macaques, although differing assay formats prevent a precise comparison. In contrast to viral vector vaccines, mRNA-LNP induces no anti-vector immunity, and can be administered repeatedly without loss of immunogenicity. The FRNT nAb titres elicited by ZIKV mRNA-LNP in macaques were maintained at a stable level until 12 weeks after immunization, suggesting that protection may be durable.
