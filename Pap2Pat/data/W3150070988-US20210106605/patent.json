    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the use of adenosine receptor modulators to affect the circadian rhythm, in particular, to the use of such modulators for the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders. In particular, the invention relates to a composition comprising at least one selective adenosine receptor modulator, wherein said composition modulates two or three, but not all of adenosine receptor subtypes A1, A2A, A2B and/or A3 for use in the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders or for modulating a biological clock.",

The drugs were formulated in a vehicle consisting of 5% Koliphor-HS15 (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) 5% Cyclodextran (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) in 0.9% saline. This vehicle was warmed to 37\u00b0 C. and the indicated drugs kept at a 100\u00d7 stock in DMSO and mixed at the appropriate concentration to be administered at approximately 300 ul intraperitoneal injection (n=6 to 10). Where the time point of injection was in the dark, the procedure was conducted under dim red light. Where measuring phase-shifting, the mice were then placed in DD and allowed to free run for 14 days in DD, running wheel activity data was collected and analysed on Clocklab (Actimetrics, Wilmette, Ill.). For jet-lag studies, mice were maintained on running wheels in light tight chambers on a 12:12 LD cycle (400 lux from white LED lamps) and injected with drugs as above at ZT6 and the LD cycle was shifted 6 hours in advance. The onset of activity on each day was used to measure phase relative to the LD cycle."

In addition to a dose dependent increase in circadian period, IB-MECA caused a concurrent increase in the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels (FIG. 1B) and activation of the cAMP response element-binding factor (CREB) as indicated by the CRE::Luc reporter construct (FIG. 1C). These experiments were repeated with other adenosine receptor agonists (1-5 as detailed in FIGS. 1D and E) and similar increases in cAMP levels and CRE::Luc were observed (FIGS. 1D and 1E).

By extension we anticipated these effects to be blocked by the pan-adenosine receptor antagonist CGS15943(9-chloro-2-(furan-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine). However, multiple adenosine receptor antagonists Istradefylline, JNJ40255293, MRS1220 and ZM241385 surprisingly and unexpectedly increased circadian period length in a dose dependent manner (FIGS. 3A-3G)). FIG. 3A shows that period lengthening was observed in Per2::Luc U2OS cells treated with JNJ40255293 (the time of application being indicated by the arrow and doses as indicated). As the cAMP could have increased as a consequence of antagonising A1 receptor (Gi coupled), the alterations in cAMP as a consequence of A1 receptor blockade in U2OS cells was evaluated. Results shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C demonstrate that none of the adenosine receptor antagonists increased the intracellular cAMP or CREB activation in U2OS cells. However, dose responsive period lengthening was observed as shown in FIGS. 3D-H in JNJ40255293, istradefylline, MRS1220 and ZM241385-treated U2OS cells respectively. In order to verify that the observed effects were due to action on adenosine receptors, the A1, A2A, A2B adenosine receptors in U2OS cells were knocked down using siRNA and the effects of the antagonists were evaluated. FIG. 3H, shows the effects of the antagonists were was abolished confirming that the observed effect on period is indeed through action on adenosine receptors.",

Similarly, JNJ40255293 was administered at CT16 (circadian time 16 or 16 h after the onset of light) and resulted in a phase delay, indicating the same drug would have different effects on circadian phase at different times, similar to light (FIG. 4E). The same protocol as above was followed as for FIGS. 4A and 4B, with the exception that rather than a release of the animals into constant dark after drug administrations, the light-dark cycle was advanced 6 h to simulate an eastward flight and an advance of 6 time zones. The vehicle treated animals (FIG. 4E) advanced their activity gradually each day, and in contrast the JNJ40255293 treated animals (FIG. 4F) shifted rapidly. The results shown in FIG. 4G show enhancement of re-entrainment was observed for both JNJ40255293 (FIG. 4G).

                                "FIGS. 5A-5E and 6A to 6H detail the effect of adenosine receptor antagonists on the cellular clock. Whilst we expected the opposite from antagonists than the agonists, we were surprised to find that antagonists of A1/A2A receptors such as JNJ40255293 produced large dose-dependent increases in period length. We observed little if any increases in cAMP (50% increase at 30 uM), certainly not to the levels required to elicit changes in circadian period. Correspondingly, we saw no changes in CREB phosphorylation or signal for CRE::Luc reporters, but observed significantly increased Per1/2 transcription at 4 h post-drug treatment (thus with a significantly different time course as the agonists) and changes in period length. These findings implicate a novel CREB-independent transcriptional axis downstream of adenosine receptors that causes a delayed induction Per1/2 transcription. Mixed A1/A2A antagonists achieved this effect (e.g. JNJ40255293) but neither A1 specific not A2A/A2B specific antagonists were able to replicate this effect. In order to identify the novel transcriptional axis downstream of A1/A2A antagonism that converged on the clock, we employed the unbiased transcription factor screening approach BC-STARPROM/30 uM JNJ40255293 significantly increased the reporter signal from 8 clones, 7 of which were predicted to contain Fos-related transcription factor binding site. We isolated clone3, which we found responded to a panel of different antagonists including JNJ40255293. The DNA sequence containing the promoter region of clone 3 was used to pull down protein binding partners from a nuclear extract of cells treated with JNJ40255293 and the isolated proteins sequenced using mass spectrometry. A few transcription factors were enriched in the CGS-treated samples, including JunD and Fosl2. Correspondingly, siRNA-mediated silencing of Fos significantly reduced the response of clone3 to CGS15943. Analysis of the Per1 and Per2 promoters revealed conserved Fos:Jun binding site within their promoters (data not shown).",

                                "We investigated the physiological relevance of our findings to the sleep axis. We predicted that sleep deprivation would increase levels of extracellular adenosine and that this would decrease clock gene expression. We found that as predicted, sleep deprivation decreases Per1/2 expression within the SCN, consistent with increased adenosine-A signalling and that this decrease was reversed by administration of JNJ40255293 and mimicked by administration of an A1 agonist. An A2A specific agonist CGS21680 had the opposite effect and increased Per1/2 expression (data not shown). We also found as previously reported, that sleep deprivation increased Per1/2 within the cortex, and that this increase was more due to the stress-glucocorticoid signalling axis as administration of mifepristone blunted this response (data not shown). The implication of these findings is that adenosine levels (presumably influenced by sleep history) can influence circadian responses. We tested this in the context of circadian-phase shifts to light. We hypothesised that A1 antagonists would enhance the effects of light, whereas A1 agonists would inhibit the phase-shifting effect of light. This is indeed what we found, that we were able to alter the depths of the two arms of the light PRC by modulating adenosine signalling. The implications of this finding could explain the different light PRCs in nocturnal versus diurnal animals",
                                "The data in FIG. 10 A to 10 C shows that sleep deprivation paradoxically increases Per2 expression within the cortex. Individual actograms (10B) supports the assertion that adenosine signalling regulates the sensitivity of the circadian clock to light. 10C shows that the A1/A2A antagonist JNJ40255293 also enhances phase-shifts in response to light at CT16, unlike the non-specific agonist IB-MECA.",
                                "The experiments detailed in FIGS. 1-10 describe the effect of adenosine receptor modulators and adenosine signalling on circadian clock function. Through both canonical (CREB-based) and novel pathways, drugs targeting the adenosine receptor system activate clock gene expression and provide a zeitgeber or time-giving message to the circadian clock. This can be used to reset, i.e. to advance or delay the phase and period of the circadian clock in vitro and also in vivo. These results support the use of adenosine receptor modulators as chronomodulatory compounds, particularly where at least two adenosine receptors are modulated in tandem.",
