    "title": "Adenosine integrates light and sleep signalling for the regulation of circadian timing in mice",
    "date": "2021-04-09",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of adenosine is strongly correlated with the need for sleep and the detection of sleep pressure is antagonised by caffeine. Caffeine also affects the circadian timing system directly and independently of sleep physiology, but how caffeine mediates these effects upon the circadian clock is unclear. Here we identify an adenosine-based regulatory mechanism that allows sleep and circadian processes to interact for the optimisation of sleep/wake timing in mice. Adenosine encodes sleep history and this signal modulates circadian entrainment by light. Pharmacological and genetic approaches demonstrate that adenosine acts upon the circadian clockwork via adenosine A1/A2A receptor signalling through the activation of the Ca2+ -ERK-AP-1 and CREB/CRTC1-CRE pathways to regulate the clock genes Per1 and Per2. We show that these signalling pathways converge upon and inhibit the same pathways activated by light. Thus, circadian entrainment by light is systematically modulated on a daily basis by sleep history. These findings contribute to our understanding of how adenosine integrates signalling from both light and sleep to regulate circadian timing in mice.",

                "In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) house the \u201cmaster circadian pacemaker\u201d. The SCN is comprised of multiple coupled neurones, each of which contain the molecular machinery to generate a circadian oscillation. The molecular clockwork in the SCN is aligned (entrained) to the astronomical day by changes in the quantity and quality of light at dawn and dusk, detected by specialised photoreceptors within the eye1. Light leads to the upregulation of two critical clock genes, Per1 and Per2, whose expression sets the phase of entrainment of the molecular clockwork2. The SCN, in-turn, coordinates the timing of peripheral circadian clocks distributed throughout the organ systems of the body. It is worth emphasising that peripheral clocks can be entrained by multiple biological signals, including temperature, metabolites and hormones such as glucocorticoids. By contrast, the SCN is primarily entrained by light. For example, the SCN is largely unresponsive to glucocorticoids3, although there is evidence that non-photic stimuli including exercise also contribute to SCN entrainment4\u20138. However, the SCN is sensitive to caffeine9\u201311, suggesting that there exists an endogenous adenosine-based regulatory pathway that is of profound importance to circadian timekeeping. However, until now, this pathway has not been elucidated.",
                "Caffeine is the world\u2019s most widely consumed stimulant and the most popular psychoactive drug12. Caffeine has multiple biological targets, but its alerting effects that counter sleep pressure13,14 are mediated by an antagonistic action on adenosine receptors15. In addition to sleep, several recent studies have shown that caffeine can also affect the circadian timing system directly and independently of sleep physiology9,10,16,17. Caffeine has been shown to: (i) alter clock gene expression of peripheral clock cells in vitro; (ii) change the phase of locomotor rhythms in mice; and (iii) alter the frequency of action potentials within the SCN, both ex-vivo and in vivo9,10,16,17. In addition, caffeine enhances phase-shifting responses to light in humans10 and also potentiates the effect of light in multiple other species16\u201318.",
                "How and why clock mechanisms should be sensitive to caffeine has remained a mystery. Because of the importance of adenosine to sleep/wake behaviour, and since sleep/wake timing and the circadian system are so intimately connected19, we hypothesised that an adenosine-based regulatory mechanism that is sensitive to caffeine might allow sleep and circadian processes to interact in a dynamic world for the optimisation of sleep/wake timing.",
                "In this paper, we describe a signalling pathway downstream of adenosine receptors that directly regulates entrainment and identify adenosine A1/A2A receptor antagonists that specifically target this pathway. Caffeine and adenosine altered clock gene expression and circadian rhythms in vitro and in vivo via the Ca2+-ERK-AP-1 pathway. We report that the significance of adenosine signalling is to encode sleep/wake history to the clock and modulate its response to light in mice. Furthermore, we show that clinically safe adenosine receptor antagonists delivered to mice at specific times act like light to phase-shift circadian rhythms, and also enhance re-entrainment to shifted light dark cycles. Therefore, we show that this signalling system provides a robust therapeutic target for the stabilisation of circadian rhythm disorders."

                "Our data, along with published findings, show that caffeine lengthens circadian period in cultured cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a, b)9,10. We therefore predicted that adenosine will act as a cell autonomous modulator of the circadian clockwork. Adenosine receptors occur as the Gs (stimulatory) coupled A2A and A2B subtypes and the Gi (inhibitory) coupled A1 and A3 subtypes20. In U2OS cells, which express both A2B and A1 receptors (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c), we observed that adenosine led to a concentration-dependent period-lengthening (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d, e). Further, knockdown of the A2B and A1 receptors had opposing effects upon period length (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f\u2013h), consistent with their receptor pharmacology. We also decreased adenosine by the addition of adenosine deaminase (ADA), which degrades adenosine to inosine in the culture medium and observed decreased period length (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i, j). Collectively, these in vitro results demonstrate a constitutive role for adenosine as a cell-autonomous regulator of circadian rhythms.",
                "To delineate the signalling pathways downstream of adenosine receptors that couple to the circadian clock, we tested a panel of different adenosine receptor antagonists and agonists. IB-MECA, an adenosine receptor agonist, activated a classical cAMP-CREB pathway that resulted in a rapid increase in PER1 and PER2 expression and increased period length (Fig.\u00a01a\u2013e). This pathway is similarly activated in SCN neurones in response to light1. However, and surprisingly, we found that several adenosine antagonists also increased period length (Fig.\u00a01f, g, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). Importantly, these antagonists did not elevate cAMP or CRE signalling (Fig.\u00a01h\u2013i, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d\u2013g), but they did induce the expression of PER1 and PER2, suggesting the existence of an alternate pathway for adenosine-mediated regulation of the molecular clockwork. Furthermore, those drugs that targeted both A1 and A2A receptors (CGS15943, henceforth referred to as CGS and JNJ40255392, henceforth referred to as JNJ) were the most potent class of modulators (Fig.\u00a01j, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02h\u2013k). We suggest that this is due to heterodimerisation of adenosine receptors, which has been shown previously to differentially activate downstream signalling cascades21. Finally, to rule out off-target effects, we showed that the adenosine receptor antagonists failed to lengthen Per2-Luc rhythms after knockdown of adenosine receptors (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02l\u2013n).Fig. 1Mechanisms of action of adenosine signalling to the clock.a 10\u2009\u03bcM IB-MECA increased period length in Bmal1-Luc U2OS cells which revert to normal rhythms after washout (arrow) in a concentration-dependent manner (traces are an average of n\u2009=\u20094) as shown in b (n\u2009=\u20094, DMSO control samples in red); c IB-MECA increases cAMP levels (as monitored by the cAMP-GLO assay) in a concentration-dependent manner (n\u2009=\u20096); d 30\u2009\u00b5M IB-MECA increases phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB S133) as shown by Western blot (n\u2009=\u20093), Forskolin positive control; e PER1 and PER2 mRNA levels in U2OS cells increase after administration of 10\u2009\u00b5M IB-MECA (n\u2009=\u20094, p\u2009<\u20090.001 with two-way ANOVA, p\u2009=\u20090.000074 at 2\u2009h for PER1, and p\u2009=\u20090.00000000000021 and 0.000000024 at 2\u2009h and 4\u2009h for PER2, \u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\u2019s multiple comparisons test).

                "In order to identify the CREB-independent transcriptional pathway downstream of adenosine receptor antagonism, we employed the unbiased transcription factor screening approach BC-STARPROM22 that identifies DNA response elements (REs) using a library of barcoded reporter luciferases. CGS increased significantly the reporter luciferase signal from 8 clones within the STARPROM library (Fig.\u00a02a). Bioinformatic analysis showed that 7 of the 8 clones contained a FOS/JUN (AP-1)-like RE, TGATTCA (AP-1 RE\u2009=\u2009TGACTCA) (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). In order to experimentally identify the factors that bound to the putative RE and flanking elements in an unbiased assay, we used a biotin-tagged oligonucleotide (from clone 3) to immunoprecipitate DNA binding proteins from the nuclear fraction of U2OS cells treated with CGS for 4\u2009h. Approximately 40 proteins were enriched by CGS (Supplementary Dataset\u00a04). An siRNA-mediated knockdown screen of the most enriched proteins showed that FOS and JUN (AP-1) silencing decreased the expression of clone3 under baseline conditions and decreased its response to CGS (Fig.\u00a02c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b, c). Importantly, we saw attenuated period lengthening by CGS in Per2-Luc U2OS cells after knockdown of either or both FOS and JUN (Fig.\u00a02d, e). Analysis of the human PER2 gene indicated several putative AP-1 REs, including some that were highly conserved and previously validated by ChIP-Seq as reported on ENCODE23 (Fig.\u00a02d). By contrast, although there are putative AP-1 REs in the PER1 promoter, they are not well conserved, suggesting that the AP-1 pathway is less important in the regulation of PER1. Supporting this hypothesis, adenosine receptor antagonists show greater PER2 induction compared to PER1 (Fig.\u00a01j).Fig. 2STAR_PROM identifies ERK-AP1 pathway downstream of adenosine signalling.a Time course of RNA-seq reads for barcoded luciferase from BC-STARPROM reporter transfected U2OS cells treated with DMSO control or 30\u2009\u03bcM CGS (n\u2009=\u20092, timeline \u2013 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8\u2009h after treatment).

                "To define the signalling elements between adenosine receptors and AP-1, we silenced a series of members of the MAPK-ERK signalling pathway that have been shown to activate AP-124 in U2OS cells, and then tested the efficacy of CGS at lengthening period using a concentration response curve (Fig.\u00a02f). We then calculated EC50 of CGS at period lengthening under each knockdown condition from the curves (Fig.\u00a02g) and found that silencing ERK1 abolished the period-lengthening effect of CGS. By contrast, silencing the Jun Kinases (JNKs) had no effect upon the action of CGS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b, c). Further, CGS-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a02f) led to increased AP-1 activity and cJUN transcription (Fig.\u00a02g). Finally, we identified Ca2+ as the messenger activating ERK1 following CGS application (Fig.\u00a02h). This is consistent with previous reports showing that all four adenosine receptors can modulate Ca2+ release20,21. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ can lead to the activation of ERK1/2 via multiple pathways including RAS, the protein tyrosine kinase PYK2 and Calmodulin Kinase 125. In short, these results define a Ca2+-ERK1/2-AP-1 pathway downstream of adenosine receptor antagonism in U2OS cells. These findings are outlined in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06.",
                "To place our in vitro findings into a physiological and behavioural context, we explored the role of adenosine signalling upon circadian rhythms within the SCN. We found that the SCN expresses both A1 and A2A adenosine receptors in a circadian manner (Fig.\u00a03a, b). Both CGS and JNJ lengthened period in ex vivo cultured Per2::Luc SCN slices (Fig.\u00a03c) and adenosine itself reduced period presumably due to the prevalence of Gi coupled A1 receptors. Also, CGS and JNJ increased ERK and CREB phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a03d) and induced Per1/2 (Fig.\u00a03e). We speculate that this is likely due to the different receptor distribution within the SCN, with inhibitory A1 receptors predominating. Here, the dominant effect of the antagonist would be inhibition of the Gi-PKA system, which would lead to an increase in cAMP and thus CREB phosphorylation. In contrast, the A2B receptors present in U2OS cells are Gs and Gq coupled, therefore their antagonism would not lead to CREB phosphorylation. However, adenosine receptor signalling is known to be very complex, with adenosine receptors forming heterodimers, modulating the release of other signalling messengers and neurotransmitters, and thus engaging different pathways depending on receptor distribution26. Therefore, what is provided above is a proposed mechanism based on the available data.Fig. 3The SCN expresses adenosine receptors and responds to adenosine receptor antagonists.a Expression of adenosine receptor (Adora) subtypes within the mouse SCN at two different circadian times (n\u2009=\u20095, A1 at a higher concentration compared to A2A p\u2009=\u20090.0138, and at higher levels at CT5 (0.178\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04) compared to CT17 (0.073\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03) p\u2009=\u20090.0223, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test). b Immunohistochemistry for A2A and A1 receptor subtypes showing expression within the SCN (inset). c SCN slice cultures from Per2::Luc mice treated with the A2A/A1 antagonists CGS15943 (CGS) 10\u2009\u03bcM (red, period length 25.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009h, n\u2009=\u20093) and JNJ40255392 (JNJ) 10\u2009\u03bcM (blue, period length 26.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009h; n\u2009=\u20095; DMSO 23.1\u2009h\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009h n\u2009=\u20095; p\u2009=\u20090.0000076439 for CGS and 0.0484 for JNJ, Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test. d Western blot with antibodies against pERK1/2 (pT202/Y204 - pERK) and pCREB (pS133) within the SCN collected from mice 45\u2009min after i.p. injection of CGS or JNJ at 5\u2009mg/kg at CT6, SCN collected from mice exposed to a 30\u2009min CT16 light pulse included for comparison (n\u2009=\u20097 from two experiments of n\u2009=\u20093 and n\u2009=\u20094, uncut blots shown in Supplementary material, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test).

                "The signalling pathways we describe for adenosine have strong parallels with those activated by light27. For example, Fos is a classical light-activated gene28,29 and AP-1 binding to DNA increases after a light-pulse within the SCN27. However, although AP-1 activation is correlated with light exposure, its role in mediating the transcriptional response of the clock to light has remained unresolved. Indeed, CREB transcription alone has been considered as the primary mediator of light responses. However, unphosphorylated CREB can bind to and repress AP-1 REs30,31. As a result, the robust phosphorylation of CREB and the expression of FOS would act synergistically to amplify downstream AP-1 transcription. Our data would support this conclusion. A motif analysis of the genes that comprise the SCN light-regulated transcriptome2 showed enrichment of both CRE and AP-1 REs (Fig.\u00a02b), underscoring the importance of AP-1 in augmenting the transcriptional responses to light. These findings are also pr\u00e9cised in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06.",
                "As adenosine receptor antagonists activate the signalling pathways downstream from light within the SCN, we hypothesised that these antagonists will induce phase-shifts of the circadian clock following administration at specific times during the night. In addition, several non-photic cues, including cAMP itself induce phase advances of the clock in vitro and in vivo during the day32\u201334 and a few enhance re-entrainment to a shifted light dark cycle35\u201337. Therefore, we tested the effects of JNJ at times that cause maximum delay in response to light (CT16), but also when non-photic cues would elicit a large advance (ZT6), and in a re-entrainment paradigm. Because JNJ has better compound solubility and a more detailed pharmacokinetic characterisation38, our in vivo experiments were largely undertaken with this drug, although findings were confirmed with at least one other A2A/A1 antagonist. JNJ administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 6\u2009h after light onset (zeitgeber time 6; ZT6) elicited large phase advances in circadian wheel-running behaviour (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c). Since adenosine-mediated regulation of the clock shares parallels with light, we also investigated the effect of JNJ administration 4\u2009h after activity onset (the time of maximum light-induced phase delays in mice) and found that JNJ similarly elicited phase delays (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f). Further, we explored whether JNJ and other A2A/A1antagonists could enhance re-entrainment to a shifted light-dark cycle, and observed this to be the case (Fig.\u00a04g\u2013i). In agreement with our in vitro findings, drugs that targeted both the A2A and A1 receptors were the most effective at phase-shifting and enhancing re-entrainment (Fig.\u00a04j, k). We then studied the properties of Istradefylline (KW6002), which is an A2A antagonist already in clinical use for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. KW6002 significantly phase shifted circadian rhythms in wheel-running behaviour (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c\u2013h, Fig.\u00a04j). Collectively, our data show that adenosine receptor antagonists have a significant and direct effect upon circadian behavioural rhythms.Fig. 4A2A/A1 adenosine receptor antagonists modify circadian behaviour.a\u2013c Mice were housed in 12:12\u2009L:D cycle, (grey \u2013 dark, white \u2013 light, black vertical bars show wheel running activity).

                "Having established how adenosine regulates circadian rhythms, we next addressed the biological relevance of this phenomenon. Extracellular adenosine levels track metabolic activity and are thus key indicators of metabolic state. Within the brain, the build-up of adenosine, presumed to be from glial and astrocyte sources, provides a strong correlate of the sleep homoeostatic drive13,39, and these changes are monitored by different parts of the brain40, most notably by the basal forebrain41, but also within the hippocampus42 and hypothalamic nuclei such as the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (VLPO), or \u201csleep switch\u201d40. Significantly, infusion of A2A agonists within the basal forebrain43 or the hypothalamus44 will induce sleep. Here we show that adenosine within the SCN shows day\u2013night differences, and is lower at the end of the sleep phase (Fig.\u00a05a) when compared to the beginning of sleep. As a result, adenosine could encode information on sleep/wake history to the molecular clockwork. Indeed, there is evidence for such an interaction. For example, increasing the homoeostatic drive for sleep through sleep deprivation changes patterns of peripheral clock gene expression in both mice and humans45,46. Whilst such links have been reported, the mechanisms that drive these interactions have remained obscure.Fig. 5Altered levels of endogenous adenosine regulate circadian rhythms in vivo.a Basal forebrain (BF) and SCN were collected from wild type and human adenosine kinase overexpressing transgenic mice (Adk-Tg - ADK) at indicated circadian times.

                "We studied the effects of adenosine on circadian behaviour in vivo, by utilising the Adk-Tg transgenic mouse which overexpresses human adenosine kinase (ADK)47. ADK phosphorylates free adenosine into adenosine monophosphate (AMP), thus overexpression of ADK enhances the metabolic clearance of adenosine. The Adk-Tg mouse shows reduced slow wave power in all vigilance states as defined by electroencephalography (EEG), and significantly, a reduced build-up of slow-wave activity after sleep deprivation48. This is consistent with reduced adenosinergic tone, which we confirm in the SCN and basal forebrain (Fig. 5 a). In the mouse SCN, we predicted that reduced adenosine would lead to less inhibition through the adenosine A1 Gi-coupled receptor, and therefore increased period length in constant dark and larger phase shifts in response to light. Both results were observed. Greater differences in phase shifting were seen at CT22 vs CT14 (p\u2009<\u20090.05 for time with a two-way ANOVA), reflecting the naturally lower adenosinergic tone at CT14 following sleep (Fig.\u00a05b\u2013d). These results suggest that the biological relevance of adenosine signalling to circadian rhythms is to incorporate sleep history into the clockwork. It has been shown previously that sleep deprivation attenuates phase shifts to light, and also that A1 receptors attenuate light signalling16,49\u201353. Indeed, we confirm that sleep deprivation between CT8-14 reduces the size of phase shifting responses to a light pulse at CT14, seen but this effect is reversed when the animals are pre-treated with JNJ (Fig.\u00a05e). To confirm that this is as a result of adenosine acting upon clock gene expression, we measured Per1/2 expression within the SCN after sleep deprivation. We found that sleep deprivation during the second half of the light phase (ZT6-12, Fig.\u00a05f, g) decreased Per1/2 expression within the SCN, consistent with increased adenosine-A1 signalling. Confirmation that the mice were indeed sleep deprived comes from our demonstration that Homer1a and Egr1 (both markers of sleep deprivation) were upregulated (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c45). Our findings are consistent with a previous study showing that there is decreased Per2 expression within the SCN following induced activity during the sleep phase54, but differ from another report suggesting that there are no changes in Per2 within the SCN after sleep deprivation55. We suggest that this discrepancy arises from the different methodological approaches used; both the first study and ours allowed access to a running wheel and were conducted at the same time (ZT6-12); however, the latter55 was conducted without a running wheel, ZT0-6. Significantly, in our studies, the decrease in Per2 in the SCN was abolished by administration of JNJ (Fig.\u00a05h), strengthening our proposal that adenosine signals sleep\u2013wake history to the circadian pacemaker.",
                "Collectively, our findings suggest that light signalling to the molecular clockwork can be altered by modulating adenosine signalling. Thus, the inhibition of adenosine-A1 signalling through A1 antagonists will enhance the phase-shifting effects of light, whereas A1 agonists will diminish the impact of light. We predicted that the converse would be true of A2A signalling, and this was confirmed. Administration of specific A1 and A2A agonists and antagonists (Fig.\u00a05i\u2013m) altered the size of both the phase delay and advance portions of the phase response curve (PRC) to light (see below for further discussion). Thus, our results demonstrate that sleep history influences circadian entrainment through the adenosine signalling pathway."

                "The integration of sleep/wake behaviour and circadian rhythms, via the mechanisms we outline in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06, also provides greater clarity on the mechanisms that mediate circadian entrainment to light. Whilst previous studies have highlighted the importance of CREB-mediated transcription for circadian phase shifts to light56, this is not the only pathway. It is important to stress that CREB targets represent only 20% of the light-regulated SCN transcriptome2 and mice expressing a dominant negative CREB (CREB S133A) show only attenuated circadian responses to light57. The work presented here shows that AP-1 provides an additional regulatory target for both light and adenosine. AP-1 binding to DNA and Fos induction has long been used as a robust marker of SCN activation27\u201329, and Fos knockout mice show attenuated responses to light58, but the signalling function of FOS has remained poorly defined. The clear relationship between FOS activation and Per transcription is discussed in the results and illustrated in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06. However, we speculate that this is unlikely to be the only role for FOS. For example, FOS has recently been shown to play a critical role in initiating chromatin opening in response to neuronal activity within the dentate gyrus59. It is possible, therefore, that FOS may also induce similar changes in chromatin within SCN neurons. By changing chromatin accessibility to transcription factors, entrainment will be subject to additional regulatory controls. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06, our results suggest that whilst CREB/CRTC1-CRE transcription drives a rapid increase in Per1 transcription, AP-1 activation via FOS/JUN mediates a slower transcriptional drive upon Per2. Such a differential activation of Per1/Per2 expression would explain why Per1 rises rapidly within the SCN after a light pulse, whilst Per2 shows a slower rise and decline in expression levels60. The functional significance of this differential activation remains to be fully resolved, but presumably relates to an increased level of precision and signal strength for circadian entrainment via these pathways.",
                "Under conditions of sleep deprivation, corresponding to a high adenosinergic tone, adenosine attenuates light-induced phase shifts. This observation is interesting in the context of entrainment. In all species studied, there is a phase response curve (PRC) to light such that light delays the circadian clock at dusk and advances the clock at dawn61,62. In this manner, light exposure at dawn and dusk ensures that circadian rhythms are appropriately aligned/entrained to the solar day on a daily basis. Mice have circadian rhythms that are significantly shorter than 24\u2009h, and so will show a daily phase advance in behavioural rhythms. As a result, mice require a daily phase delay to ensure that the clock is entrained to the 24\u2009h day. Without such delaying cues, the endogenous delaying sleep/wake cycle of mice will drift earlier in time. Significantly, mice would have high levels of adenosine at dawn (following a night of activity), whilst adenosine levels will be low at dusk (following a day of sleep). Because adenosine acts to inhibit the effects of light on the circadian clock, dusk light will induce large phase delays, whilst dawn light will induce small phase advances. Whilst these observations may not hold true in all species, suggesting there are more factors at play here than just adenosine, we speculate that the reverse would be true in humans, as we sleep during the night and have longer clocks (>24\u2009h). In this manner, light and sleep/wake history could interact to achieve optimal sleep/wake timing (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07)."
