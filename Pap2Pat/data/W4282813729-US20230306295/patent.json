In the publication of Knill Emanuel, Raymond Laflamme, and Lorenza Viola, \u201cTheory of quantum error correction for general noise\u201d Physical Review Letters 84.11 (2000): 2525. A general description of arbitrary system-environment couplings in terms of a graded interaction algebra is disclosed. The degree of an operator in this algebra both determines the temporal order and the extent to which the operator can affect the system, independent of the internal evolution of the environment. In the case of qubits with independent one-qubit interactions, this notion coincides with the usual concepts of \u201cnumber of errors\u201d or \u201cerror weight\u201d used in combinatorial error analysis. It is disclosed that the generalization of minimum distance relates to error correction in the usual way and show that, irrespective of the nature of the environmental noise, large codes exist depending solely on the dimension of the linear space of errors of a given order. This publication discloses an error correction code that requires at least four qubits to work. The proof exists that in order work with probability of success equal to one and to recover information form the channel affected by the noise of Choi rank not greater than two, it needs to use more than two qubits.",

Such hierarchies when applied to the problem of approximate error correction in quantum information theory, give hierarchies of efficiently computable outer bounds on the success probability of approximate quantum error correction codes in any dimension. The approximate error correction codes by design return approximate encoded state and they do not allow for perfect recovery of the initial state.",

McFadden. \u201cSparse-graph codes for quantum error correction.\u201d IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 50.10 (2004): 2315-2330 the authors explored the conjecture that the best quantum error-correcting codes will be closely related to the best classical codes. By converting classical low-density parity-check codes into quantum codes, the authors hope to find families of excellent quantum codes. The approach relies on further conjecture claiming that practical decoding algorithms have been found for classical low-density parity-check codes, it seems likely that a practical decoding algorithm will also exist for quantum low-density parity-check codes. It also discloses the stabilizer formalism for describing quantum error-correcting codes that encode a quantum state of K qubits in N qubits, and explains how a general stabilizer code is related to a classical binary code.",

During the course of quantum error correction, an error syndrome is measured and the correction procedure continues dependent on this measurement. As a second application of probabilistic error correction, the likelihood that error correction will succeed given that a particular syndrome is measured is analyzed. This likelihood, is called the syndrome quality, may enhance the effectiveness of a quantum information process for which quantum error correction plays a role. For example, it is conceivable that a quantum information process may benefit from aborting a subroutine if at some point a syndrome of especially low quality is measured.",

Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using fewer than r measurements.

In the description we use the second qubit in a ground state |0 however the second qubit can be put into any arbitrary fixed state |d1without departing from the scope of the invention.
